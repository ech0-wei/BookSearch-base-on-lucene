GRI pushes for consortium on fuel cylinder research

     The industry may be moving closer to forming a consortium to
coordinate efforts on solving the onerous storage problem for
compressed natural gas.
     The Gas Research Institute has been calling for such a group
since its President Stephen Ban made a pitch this spring. At the
time, he hinted that the group could follow the structure of the U.S.
Council for Automotive Research, an  organization formed by the Big
Three automakers to perform generic, pre-market research on
technological problems in the automotive industry.
     Ban suggested that not only should the major automakers be
involved, but also the gas industry, government agencies and
equipment suppliers. Traditional defense contractors have already
been making strides in developing lightweight, composite CNG
cylinders, and Ban said that without such a consortium, "natural gas
use in vehicles can't fulfill its tremendous potential."
     A spokesperson for the USCAR said although there's been some
discussion, the group likely would not be made part of USCAR.

GM sets up NGV hotline

     General Motors now has a toll-free number, 1-800-GMC-4NGV
(1-800-462- 4648), for questions about the status of its natural gas
vehicle (NGV) program.
     As reported, GM decided to buy back or replace with a new
gasoline-powered version its 1992-93 Sierra pickups that were
upfitted with a natural gas fuel system by PAS Inc., after two
incidents of fuel cylinder ruptures on those trucks earlier this
year.
      The automaker also put on hold its current program to provide
dual-fuel NGVs with conversion company Impco Technologies.
     The automaker said in early June that of about 2,500 of the
1992-93 pickups eligible for the buyback, 2,100 owners had decided on
the refund option while 400 had decided on the replacement with the
gasoline version.
     The largest single owner of the trucks, the General Services
Administration, appears to be opting for the buyback option, GM said.
     GM will soon release validation specs for compressed natural gas
fuel cylinders and will ask manufacturers to prove they can meet
those new specifications, said Gery Jankovits, with Chevrolet's
Commercial/Specialty group, last month at an Atlanta clean vehicle
conference. Once GM is able to acquire fuel cylinders that meet the
new guidelines, they will once again offer NGVs under the Impco
program.
     The program will start out with offerings of the Caprice,
Corsica and C2500 pickups, and will expand to other models as fuel
cylinders become available, Jankovits added. GM has said it hopes to
begin taking orders for NGVs by the end of the year.

Chicago joins Clean Cities ranks

     Chicago became the ninth member of the Energy Dept.'s Clean
Cities program in May.
     The program targets the replacement of one-third of existing
government and private fleet vehicles with alternative fuel vehicles
(AFVs) by 1998.
     Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, Mayor Richard Daley and
executives from 50 transportation and energy companies in a
six-county region signed the partnership agreement. The city has
announced it is fuel-neutral, and has tested natural gas,
electricity, ethanol and soy-diesel as vehicle fuels.
     The group has targeted 1,000 vehicle conversions per year, and
construction of 80 refueling stations.
     The overall goal of the Clean Cities program is to have 250,000
AFVs on the road and 1,000 stations installed in 50 cities across the
nation by 1996.
     Other member cities include Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Denver, Las
Vegas, Philadelphia, Washington and Wilmington, Del.

GRI suggests steps to prevent NGV tank failures

     The Gas Research Institute (GRI) has proposed a three-part
approach to preventing the kind of natural gas vehicle (NGV) fuel
tank ruptures that were seen earlier this year on GMC Sierra pickups.
     As reported, fuel cylinders on two Sierras owned by utilities
ruptured during or just after the refueling process early this year.
The culprit was later found to be acids that had corroded the fiber
overwrap on the cylinders, causing the overwrap to crack.
     As a result of investigations by the Southwest Research
Institute and GRI's own program, GRI is recommending the following:
     * Modification of the shield that protected the cylinder from
stones and other road debris. The stone shield on the Sierra's acted
as a "bathtub" according to some sources, trapping liquids and
keeping them against the cylinder.
     * Using cylinder coatings that have proved to be acid-resistant.
     * A program for NGV operators that increases awareness of the
effects of acid on uncoated, composite-wound cylinders and encourages
improved maintenance and safer handling of cylinders.
     In both instances, it was found that acid had leaked from the
truck beds through bolt holes drilled into the beds to hold the fuel
cylinders underneath the truck. At Pacific Gas & Electric, the acid
leaked from used batteries carried in the truck bed. At Minnegasco,
the source of the acid was undetermined, although it was speculated
to have been cleaning solutions or fertilizer carried in the bed.
     Contrary to initial rumors, GRI said that neither road salt nor
water were a factor in the failures.
     GRI recommended the following for current NGV users:
     * Immediately inspect cylinders for stress corrosion cracking.
     * Periodically inspect cylinders using manufacturer guidelines
on visual inspections of cylinders.
     * Ensure that installations avoid acidic-fluid contact with
cylinders and that users are aware of the impact of acids on
cylinders.
     * For operators who add cylinders, ensure that cylinders are
mounted so that any continuous immersion in fluids is minimized.
     GRI is distributing the guidelines to its member companies, to
participants in a recent GRI-sponsored NGV workshop and through the
Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition.

Kit makers work to meet CARB durability tests

     The standoff between the conversion industry and California
regulators over how to meet aftermarket kit durability regulations
has ended with at least three major natural gas conversion companies
planning to meet the requirements, industry sources tell NGV News.
     Under the rule, which went into effect Jan. 1, conversion
companies that wish to remain CARB-certified by the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) must have 15% of their engine family kits meet
a 100,000 mile durability test by the end of the year. In 1995, the
percentage increases to 55% and by 1996, all aftermarket conversions
must meet the standard.
     The regulation affects the entire aftermarket conversion
industry because companies that do not sell equipment in California
often market products to other states and the federal government,
which require CARB certification as a condition of the contract.
     But as recently as last October, conversion companies said they
couldn't provide any emissions data until CARB clarified what kind of
durability tests would qualify (NGVN 10/93). Meanwhile, CARB
regulators blamed program delays on manufacturers waiting to see
which engine families would be sought by fleet customers.
     Since then, the board and several conversion companies have
worked out a system that both parties agree on. Natural gas interests
attribute part of this new spirit of cooperation to the presence this
term of four new board members and a new chairperson who have made
the staff more supportive of industry efforts.
     According to Greg Vlasek of the California Natural Gas Vehicle
Coalition, Impco, GFI Control Systems and Mogas all intend to meet
the durability standard by submitting data generated from
100,000-mile road tests designed to simulate deterioration. In March,
CARB gave Impco and GFI the green light to perform the tests;
meanwhile, the board is negotiating with Mogas on a procedure.
     Impco says 38 engine family kits will be approved in '94,
including some for liquefied propane as well as CNG, company
officials say. In addition, the company will certify up to four
engine families as an OEM in 1995, says Impco Director of Engineering
Syed Hussain.
     Other conversion kit companies such as GFI plan to sell 11 CNG
conversion kits with CARB approval. Mogas wants to sell six engine
family kits for propane users only. To be certified, conversion
companies must present their data to CARB by October. Certification
should occur two months later, a CARB official told NGV News.
     The track tests, which cost $150,000 per vehicle to perform, are
an expensive way to meet CARB's requests but are the only practical
method now available to the industry, says Vlasek. The only other
option is to submit benchmark test protocols like the Big Three do
for OEM conversions. While ideally this would cost less money per
vehicle, the expense of testing dozens of vehicles is still too
great, and similar data held by automakers is proprietary, Vlasek
said.
     "Certification has proved to be much more costly than anyone
anticipated," he said. "It's a tremendous burden on the industry. We
just want the same level playing field that the OEMs have right now."
     As one of the largest aftermarket conversion companies, Impco is
shouldering a lot of that cost, but company officials say it's
necessary for market credibility.
     "CARB is doing the right thing. Emission standards need to be
strict for everyone for the industry to be credible," says Impco's
Hussain, who predicts that in five years aftermarket conversion
demand will still be strong, "but a lot of those fly by-nighters will
have left."
     And even natural gas supporters admit that from CARB's point of
view, the stringent certification process for aftermarket kits makes
sense: if something goes wrong with a retrofit system, many companies
could not afford a major recall like the Big Three can. Instead, they
would go bankrupt before being able to fix a defect, and motorists
would have little recourse.
     "By ensuring product safety and emissions controls up front, it
will save time and money down the road," notes Vlasek.
     Looking to the future, natural gas interests in California hope
in 1995 to work with local gas utilities to come up with a benchmark
test in order to avoid the more laborious route of testing vehicles
on a track for durability. The coalition is hoping that CARB will
allow emissions data from one vehicle to be carried over to other
vehicles that share similar engines and emission controls. OEMs are
already allowed to go this route, but natural gas interests are still
waiting for an OK from the board.

Seattle LNG buses axed; support vehicles eyed

     Seattle politicos have put the kibosh on the city's ambitious
program to convert its transit buses to run on liquefied natural gas
(LNG), but the local government is studying other vehicles for
possible conversion to natural gas.
     On May 9, the Metropolitan King County Council passed, on an 8-
2 vote, an ordinance that would cancel contracts the local transit
agency had with Bus Industries of America and Liquid Carbonic, for
construction of an LNG plant and 810 buses by 2000 (NGVN 5/94, 4/94).
     After conducting a two-year study of alternative fuels, Seattle
Metro last July recommended LNG for its buses. But since that
decision, the city and county governments in Seattle agreed to merge,
Seattle Metro lost its status as an independent agency and more
conservative officials took the reins of the local government. Those
new officials thought the cost of the LNG program too high, and opted
instead to spend money expanding routes and adding more conventional
buses.
     One Seattle Metro official said what killed the program was
"happy talk ... That's what killed the bus program ... we got lots of
happy talk from legislators, the bus builders, the gas industry ...
but when it came time to sign the check, all the happy talk was
gone."
     It's now up to the lawyers to decide what costs have been
incurred so far and how Liquid Carbonic and Bus Industries will be
compensated. A Liquid Carbonic official said just after the decision
he had not been officially notified of the cancellation and couldn't
comment.
     Seattle Metro will continue observing technological and economic
developments in the industry and will likely take another look at
alternative fuels in two years, said Jim Boone, Metro's maintenance
supervisor. Boone had said earlier they might try to use some of the
federal funding they received for the LNG buses to keep Bus
Industries on as the builder of the new diesel buses.
     The alternative fuels cost issue also could stymie efforts by
the county government and Seattle Metro to convert more support
vehicles to natural gas and propane, Boone said.
     The county government has identified about 1,800 support
vehicles, light-duty vehicles up to one ton, which could be converted
to alternative fuels, specifically natural gas. They're putting
together a feasibility study on such issues as conversion costs and
refueling station needs, and expect to release the results soon.
     King County already has 175 vehicles operating on CNG, 75 of
those police cruisers, and has built two refueling stations. A third
station, a joint venture of the city and county governments, is under
construction, noted Windell Mitchell, a fleet official with King
County.
     One of the things stopping additional station construction is
the consolidation of local government. Sites that would be ideal for
the county to build a station on are targeted for annexation by the
city in the next two years, Mitchell noted.
     County officials also recently met with representatives from 14
public and private fleet operators in the area, including Microsoft
and Boeing. They've all expressed at least some interest in NGVs, and
BP Oil has indicated it would be interested in building some stations
if the market is right, Mitchell said.
     Mitchell pointed out one disappointment they've had recently
after the General Services Administration decided that the AFV fleet
vehicles it would place in the area will be fueled by methanol.
Mitchell said the decision seemed "strange" since there's no
infrastructure for methanol in the area and other fleet operators
seem more interested in NGVs.

NGV producers form association

     A group of natural gas vehicle (NGV) producers have formed a new
association to share information and costs involved in bringing NGVs
to market.
     The NGV Producers Association's first contract involves sharing
the cost of engineering and test services to qualify under Ford's
Qualified Vehicle Modifier (QVM) program.
     Under the QVM program, Ford hopes to qualify companies to
perform upfits on new vehicles to run on natural gas and sell them
through Ford dealerships. The conversion companies must meet certain
requirements and guidelines to join, and pay their own expenses,
including testing.
     The first model the association is developing under the QVM
program is the Ford F-series pickup.
     The association is based in Washington, D.C., with Wayne Smith
serving as managing director. Board members include John Bacon,
president of TDM World Conversions Ltd., Steven Laden, vice president
of Southern Union Gas, and Howard Phelan, chairman of NGV Systems.

Canada extends incentive program

     Canada's Natural Resources Minister Anne McLellan has announced
the country is restarting an incentive program for NGVs to help boost
the natural gas industry and help the environment.
     The Market Development Incentive Payment Fund provides C$1000
toward the purchase of a new NGV or the cost of conversion. For
refueling stations, even those designated for home use, C$500 is
available. And up to 25% of the capital cost, or up to $50,000, is
available to distributors who install public or private refueling
stations.
     The program is funded by a fee from Alberta gas producers and
each provincial government. About C$15 million is left over from the
original C$160 million collected for the program in the 1980s.

Logo clouds relations between cab company, D.C. agency

     Disagreement over a logo is fouling relations between the
District of Columbia's Taxicab Commission and a company that operates
a fleet of vehicles powered by natural gas.
     Some 10 months after Clean Air Cab began operations amid
enthusiastic expressions of support from the Clinton administration
and Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, the atmosphere in the nation's capital
has become decidedly less cordial for the company (NGVN 7/93, 3/93,
2/93).
     The commission has issued an order demanding that Clean Air Cab
either change its logo or shut down, according to the company's vice
president, Dave Moederndorfer.
     At issue is whether Clean Air Cab will abandon its trademark
symbols of a white, fluffy cloud and the perennial little blue flame.
The commission has ordered it to do so, calling the logo misleading,
but the company has refused.
     Commission Chair Karen Jones Herbert also has accused the
company of false advertising, according to Moederndorfer, because its
cabs bear the assertion that they are powered by natural gas even
though they are dual-fuel, or capable of running on either natural
gas or gasoline.
     Neither Herbert nor other members of the commission responded to
telephone calls from NGV News seeking comment on the agency's stance
in the controversy.
     Clean Air Cab could have its five-car fleet booted or towed and
be fined $500 per day if it refuses to repaint or reconfigure the
cabs, according to the order, which was issued in late May.
     "We feel that [the order is] impeding free enterprise and free
speech," Moederndorfer said. "We don't know of anybody that has
patented a white cloud as a statement in general, and the blue flame
is an international symbol for natural gas."
     He also dismissed the commission's assertion that the wording on
the cabs is misleading. "How can we mislead and confuse when we do
run on natural gas?" he asked, adding that the company receives free
gas from Washington Gas Light as part of the deal that led the owners
to create the company.
     Moederndorfer added that Clean Air Cab had received an
interest-free technology loan from Consolidated Natural Gas in
Pittsburgh and price concessions for vehicles from Ford and General
Motors, which want to showcase their products with cleaner fuels.
     In addition, Clean Air Cab passed "very rigorous testing" by the
environmental group Green Seals, which found that the cabs run on
natural gas 96% of the time, he said. The other 4% represents driving
the cars to Martinsburg, W.Va., for repairs when a problem occurs
with the natural gas system, he added.
     The company is far from cowed by the commission's actions,
however.
     "We have sent a letter of appeal to the commission, to which I
have not heard any response," Moederndorfer said recently.
     In addition to continuing operating the cars it has on the road,
Clean Air Cab intends to go forward with plans to add 10 more
dual-fuel vehicles to its fleet soon, he said.
     But the heady days when the company's cabs glided down the
district's streets as part of President Clinton's inaugural parade
and Kelly presented it with its first license plate are gone.
     Today, it's more like a war of attrition with a commission that
Moederndorfer thinks may be motivated as much by a fear of
competition for traditionally fueled cabs from cleaner fuels as by
concern for consumers.
     "We are promoting the use of natural gas," he said. "I think
they see us as a competitive threat."

Fleets disappointed with alternative fuel progress

     ATLANTA -- Fleet owners still have many concerns about switching
their vehicles to alternative fuels, and that could spell a longer
wait for those companies hoping to cash in on the natural gas vehicle
(NGV) market.
      Patsy Brownson, president of the National Assn. of Fleet
Administrators (NAFA), told the Clean Air Vehicle conference last
month that these problems need to be addressed to encourage the
widespread use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs).
     "Fleets hold a key to the successful change to cleaner
vehicles," Brownson said. Fleets are the ones targeted by federal and
state mandates to use alternative fuels. Brownson speaks for 2,300
fleet managers who are members of NAFA, representing about 3 million
vehicles in the United States and Canada.
     Those wanting to sell alternative fuels should remember that the
majority of fleet operators don't have mechanics or garages or
on-site refueling, Brownson noted. The reason they have fleets at all
is to provide more efficient  transportation for their company's
business at a lower cost.
     She outlined six areas of concern:
     * Aftermarket conversions. Many fleets have tried conversions
and run into operational trouble, Brownson said. NAFA is hoping that
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will require more
reliability and durability from converted vehicles in its final rule
on aftermarket conversions, expected to be issued soon. "Until these
conversions become more reliable... fleets will be reluctant to use
them," and will continue to overwhelmingly prefer original equipment
vehicles, she said.
     * Utility. Fleets can't afford to lose trunk space or operate
vehicles that only get an 85-mile range, she said. And fleet managers
need more choices of models too -- not just the pickups, vans and
large sedans typically available now.
     * Convenience and efficiency. More refueling time is usually
needed with AFVs, and since refueling stations are still scarce,
there's also productive work time lost locating those stations, she
explained.
     * Reliability. A business can't use vehicle problems as an
excuse for missing appointments or deadlines.
     * High cost. "A good fleet manager struggles to shave a few
hundred dollars from the purchase or lease price of a vehicle. So can
you imagine the response from top management when someone says the
new vehicles will cost $2,500 more? Or even $1,000 more?" she asked.
     * Need for more real-world data. Fleets are hungry for more data
on the daily use of AFVs, and NAFA is encouraging its own members, as
well as the EPA and Energy Dept. to compile lots more case studies on
how these vehicles perform in sales, service and delivery fleets,
Brownson said.
     There are and will be AFV fleet success stories, Brownson added.
But most of those successes happen at larger companies with in-house
mechanics, engineers, on-site or numerous off-site refueling stations
and forward- thinking management.

King County forges ahead with NGV conversions

     Despite some setbacks mainly caused by political forces in the
area, Seattle's King County has established natural gas as its
alternative fuel of choice and is working to expand its NGV fleet.
     Last year, King County's Vehicle Service Manager Windell
Mitchell was seeking out other fleets, particularly police fleets,
that were operating NGVs. Today, with 175 NGVs in King County's
fleet, other managers are seeking out Mitchell.
     About 75 of those NGVs are police cruisers, and the rest are a
hodgepodge of service vehicles like vans, pickups and sedans. They
all retain the capability to use gasoline and most were converted
using Technocarb kits. Those kits have cost about $4,000 each with
fuel tanks, and another $400 each for the newer version with
electronics, Mitchell said. The vehicles are getting about 115 miles
per fill- up on average, he added.
     The county has two fast-fill refueling stations, each costing
about $325,000 and capable of handling 300 vehicle. A third station,
in a joint venture with the city of Seattle, is planned that will
handle 750 vehicles. King County is getting its gas for about 52
cents/equivalent gallon at the sites now.
     One factor hindering plans for expansion of the fleet has been a
decision to merge the county and city governments in Seattle, which
will be a phased-in process.
     For instance, the county wanted to convert the police cruisers
at a certain precinct on the county's edge, but decided not to since
that precinct will be one of the first annexed by the city in 1996.
     King County is conducting a study of how it could proceed with
more NGV conversions. It has identified 1,807 vehicles, all
light-duty, up to one ton, that are likely candidates for conversion,
out of a total fleet of about 3,200 vehicles.
     The big concern is the county's budget. As Ellen Bevington,
supervisor of capital program management for the county, explained,
it will be difficult to plan for more conversions in the county
budget over the next two years. With city annexations and
incorporation, the county will be losing more of its tax base.
     Another recent decision that doesn't bode well for more light-
duty conversions is a vote by the newly elected, more conservative
county council to cancel Seattle Metro's conversion from diesel to
LNG buses. The council called the project too expensive, and decided
to spend money on adding more diesel buses and expanding Metro's
routes. The similarities between the Metro project and the light-duty
vehicle project are "eerie," Bevington added.
     The study on that light-duty vehicle projected is being
finalized now and will be forwarded to the county executive soon.
     *Amoco Oil and Washington Gas have opened their refueling
station in the nation's capitol to the public. Previously, only
fleets involved in demonstration projects with the utility had used
the station, which is located at 9th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,
S.E. CNG is selling at the station for 84.9  cents/equivalent gallon.
     * Amoco Oil also opened two more public stations in the Atlanta
area last month, bringing the Amoco station count in that city to
seven. The new stations are on Franklin Road near Dobbins Air Force
Base in Marietta and on Old Dixie Highway, near I-285 in Forest Park.
     * The Georgia Building Authority has opened Georgia's largest
NGV refueling station in Atlanta to serve the state motor pool. More
than 140 state vehicles have already been converted to natural gas
and will be refueled at the station.
     * Atlanta Gas Light is supplying natural gas and equipment to
the station under its promotional V-52 rate. The state will be
getting gas for about 50 cents/equivalent gallon.
     * Montana-Dakota Utilities has opened a second public station in
Bismarck, N.D. The facility is at a Sinclair gasoline station owned
by D&J Enterprises, on the city's north side near a major
intersection with I-94.
     Montana-Dakota itself has converted 250 vehicles, or more than
half its fleet, to run on natural gas. About 250 other vehicles have
been converted in the utility's service area and are using its
network of 13 NGV stations.
     * Birmingham. Ala., got its first NGV station last month as part
of a joint venture between Alagasco and Sonat Ventures. The station
is at 200 West Oxmoor Road and is designed to handle 150 vehicles per
day.
     * East Ohio Gas is planning a three-year, $2.5 million upgrade
of its 12 NGV stations in northeast Ohio. The company plans to
install new dryers, meters, card readers and dispensers, as well as
replacing DOT dispensers with ASME vessels at each fast-fill station
and improving compressor output for a faster fill. As part of the
program, East Ohio also will upgrade its vehicles, replacing 2400 psi
cylinders with 3600 psi tanks.

L.A. Airport commits to LNG; SoCal to build station

     The Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) will be the site for
California's first liquefied natural gas (LNG) refueling station as
the airport embarks on a plan to convert all of its fleet to natural
gas.
     Southern California Gas won a one-year contract to build a
temporary station and provide LNG, which will initially be shipped in
from Wyoming, said Lloyd Klefstad, chief of construction and
maintenance for the airport. The station will consist of two tanks,
with a total 10,500 gallon capacity, mounted on two skids with a pump
in between and a completion date of June.
     The station will be a temporary one until a larger, permanent
facility is built to handle the growing fleet. The airport will pay
$8,000/month for the SoCal station, with Klefstad estimating fuel
costs at 67 cents/gallon.
     LAX has ordered 14 LNG buses from Gillig Bus Co. and plans to
buy eight more in the next fiscal year. The Gillig buses should be
delivered beginning in June. Funding for the first 14 buses, at
$255,000 each, is coming out of the airport's budget. The South Coast
Air Quality Management District is providing a grant to cover the
difference between the conventional and LNG bus cost for the next
eight buses, Klefstad said.
     LAX opted for LNG for its buses, due to range and weight
concerns with compressed natural gas (CNG). The Gillig buses will
carry a single LNG tank, and have a range of about 300 miles.
     The airport is considering several options for the permanent LNG
station, and has been talking to the local Metropolitan Transit
Authority (MTA) and other local bus fleets about making the permanent
station public. MTA is already planning to buy 75 LNG buses for its
own fleet.
     SoCal said its interest in helping build a permanent station
and/or an LNG plant for the area depends on the success of the
temporary station and the success of LNG in general in capturing area
fleets.
     The permanent station also may serve as an LNG-to-CNG refueling
station. LAX is considering converting its light-duty vehicles to
CNG. United Airlines already has some vehicles running on CNG at the
airport, and is making its refueling station available to airport
authority vehicles.

Industry addresses NGV problems at workshop

     Innovators unveiled strategies to overcome natural gas vehicles'
(NGV) most formidable obstacles at the first-ever advanced components
workshop for NGVs.
     The conference was hosted by the Defense Dept.'s Advanced
Research Project Agency to provide insight on technological advances
for NGVs. The Commerce Business Daily is expected to publish a broad
agency announcement sometime this month requesting proposals for
project funding, which will be open to the industry.
     "We're finally getting NGV people to talk to each other," said
Steve Scharf of System Planning Corp., a support contractor for ARPA.
Another participant said the industry will now have the opportunity
to network and link new components yielding a vehicle "that is twice
as good."
     Participants presented hi-tech proposals to increase on-board
storage, improve fuel sensor and control systems, facilitate natural
gas compression and home refueling and enhance vehicle performance,
range and safety.
     Stephen Takagishi, Gas Research Institute executive technology
manager for NGVs, said it is critical for the future of natural gas
vehicles that the industry cut in half the cost of fueling stations
and storage cylinders and find ways to increase safety through fuel
consistency sensor systems.
     A Los Angeles-based firm, NGV/USA, told participants it has
solved the range problem by designing the first vehicle specifically
incorporating natural gas cylinders into the frame. The result is a
chassis platform that can travel 800 to 1,000 miles between fueling.
     Although there is nothing technologically unique about the
platform, designer Nick Pugh said, the secret is in the design, which
was built from the ground up with NGVs in mind. He described the
two-piece "sandwich" platform as a "tight, well-designed egg crate"
that houses four tanks and holds about 35 gallons equivalent of
gasoline.
     "Other natural gas vehicle manufacturers are solving the range
problem on a component-by-component basis and that's great. But our
idea is to create a vehicle layout which utilizes all these specific
components, particularly the cylinders."
     The versatile chassis platform may house a mini-van, pickup
truck, full-size van or a box van. Energy-absorbing end caps and side
impact rails surrounding the cylinders provide safety mechanisms.
     The program will cost $1 million, and it will take about 12-18
months to complete the prototype. NGV/USA, a member of CALSTART, said
it believes it will be able to raise matching funds for half the
program cost.
     Anti-ballistic missile technology spawned during the Reagan Star
Wars era is serving a liquefication apparatus that will convert
methane at a fraction of the startup cost of a big plant, said David
Bruderly of Bruderly Associates, which is developing the product with
Cryenco Sciences.
     The TADOPTR (thermo acoustic driver orifice pulse tube
refrigeration) uses acoustic energy rather than the industrial-sized
compressors, bearings and seals used in large conversion plants. The
resulting apparatus will need less maintenance because it has no
working parts or seals. It may be built for less than $1 million, and
will produce about 10,000 gallons a day.
     "To make LNG at a big plant you have to invest $40 million,"
Bruderly said. "It has not been cost-effective to make small
quantities of LNG using existing technology." But the TADOPTR makes
it possible by producing LNG for 40 cents a day, he added.
     Bruderly is working also with Hydrogen Consulting to formulate a
"high-test" CNG fuel which reduces overall vehicle emissions. By
adding 15% hydrogen to the fuel volume, they have created "hythane"
at only a slightly higher cost than plain natural gas.
     "The EPA has performed tests and documents that hythane is 25%
cleaner than straight natural gas," especially during acceleration
tests that simulate passing and cold starts, Bruderly said.
     San Diego-based BKM Inc. said it has solved the problem of fuel
inconsistencies by designing a gas quality sensor which uses sound
measurements to control engine functions. Software in the system will
make adjustments to instantly compensate for variations in fuel
composition and quality.
     "What's unique is not necessarily measuring the speed of sound,"
said BKM President Bill Johnson, "but what we do with the sensory
output, to use it to control engine functions."
     An NGV fuel sensor system developed by Aerojet utilizes the same
technology that was used in the space shuttle to monitor exhaust and
detect leaks. Aerojet's sensor uses microelectronics to predetermine
the hydrocarbon, or energy content, of the fuel prior to combustion.
     The sensor works in tandem with data fusion technology, so that
the fuel mix may be appropriately adjusted, reducing emissions. Other
sensors which are commonly calometric are 20% to 40% less accurate
and not as fast as the microeletric sensor, said Marvin Young,
Aerojet director of technology.
     Kennedy Space Center is designing an energy-independent
compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling center to eventually service its
fleet of 1,200 tour buses, light duty and heavy equipment vehicles.
However, mechanical engineer Bobbie Surmans said the solar-powered
structure has been "expensive and difficult to design," and she has
not yet determined whether the project will be economically viable.
     Other technology presented at the workshop included:
     * A compact driveway appliance that can refuel an NGV in eight
hours designed for home and non-combat military vehicles, designed by
Western Research and General Pneumatics.
     * An energy-independent natural gas compressor, which produces
CNG or LNG faster and more inexpensively than other compressors while
also being 80% smaller, presented by Marius Paul of Engine Corp. of
America.

Power plant emissions fuel AFV debate

     Two recent studies have come up with conflicting views about the
emissions benefits of different alternative fuel vehicles.
     As reported last month, Energy International performed a study
for the Gas Research Institute (GRI) that found NGVs run neck and
neck with electric vehicles (EVs) in measuring air quality benefits,
once you take into account the emissions from power plants that
produce electricity for EVs (NGVN 5/94).
     But a recent World Resources Institute (WRI) study found that
carbon-based fueled vehicles don't do enough to curb tailpipe
pollutants. WRI is a research group that backs renewable energy.
     The WRI report stated that substituting methanol or ethanol for
gasoline could actually result in higher levels of ozone, and would
not reduce production of greenhouse gases believed to cause global
warming.
     Compressed natural gas vehicles didn't fare much better, said
WRI report author James MacKenzie. The group found that while NGVs
reduce both carbon monoxide and smog levels when compared to
traditional vehicles, the methane they emit is also a greenhouse gas.
     The reports were released at a critical point in the California
Air Resources Board's (CARB) review of its low-emission vehicle
standards. It adds weight to California's new air quality requirement
that 2% of vehicles sold in the state beginning in 1998 must be
zero-emission -- a standard that only EVs are capable of meeting at
this time.
     The Energy International study found that Chrysler's 1994
dedicated CNG vans, minivans and wagons are not only environmentally
comparable to electric vehicles but can even outperform them on
nitrogen oxide, sulfuric oxides and particulate matter emissions.
     The study found that NGVs may even be superior to electric in
the Northeast, where utility companies burn greater concentrations of
coal, said Ken Darrow, Energy International chief analyst.
      However, MacKenzie contends that power companies will not
contribute more sulfur emissions while generating electricity to fuel
electric vehicles because "total sulfur-dioxide emissions are capped
by the 1990 Clean Air Act." MacKenzie adds that power companies will
use more scrubbers or lower sulfur coal to generate the electricity
used to fuel EVs.

Ohio adopts plan that encourages AFVs

     Ohio has formed a task force to form an energy plan for the
state, and one of the issues being addressed is alternative fuel
vehicles.
     The Ohio Energy Strategy Task Force consists of officials from
18 state agencies. In developing the energy plan, they made several
suggestions for encouraging AFVs in Ohio:
     * AFV equipment makers should be encouraged to move into the
state.
     * Ohio Dept. of Transportation should expand the activities of
the state Alternative Fuels Advisory Council.
     * Ohio Commerce Dept. should review safety standards for AFVs;
and
     * The governor's office should monitor the number of AFVs in the
state fleet.

DOE opens coffers for clean fuel programs

     The Dept. of Energy (DOE) is releasing some funds for
alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) conversions to state and local
government fleets.
     One program involves the release of $924,000 in funding for the
purchase of heavy-duty AFVs by state and municipal agencies. Clean
Cities participants are being given an edge in qualifying, since
being a member automatically gives those cities 40 of the 100
selection criteria points.
     The grants are to be awarded by state agencies and will cover
the incremental cost of buying up to four vehicles powered by natural
gas, methanol, ethanol, propane or bio-diesel. Awards will be made by
Sept. 30. For more information, contact your state energy office.
     In another program recently announced, DOE's Kansas City Support
office is offering $60,000 for expenses incurred in transportation
and AFV activities and initiatives in Region VII, covering Iowa,
Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.
     Covered activities include exchanges of personnel, travel
expenses when traveling to meetings or conferences, Clean Cities
program marketing and promotions, or AFV marketing and promotions.
     Awards should be made by July 30. For more information, contact
Benjamin Watson, 816-426-4770 or John Stacy, 816-426-5182.

W. Va. assembly considers NGV bills

     The West Virginia legislature is considering two newly
introduced bills designed to advance alternative fuel vehicle use in
the state.
     Senate Bill 401 would exempt alternative motor vehicle fuels
from the state's gasoline and special fuel excise tax. State, county,
municipal or agency fleets would be 100% exempt indefinitely. But
other AFV owners would only be exempt for 10 years. After that, the
exemption would be phased out over three years.
     The other legislation, House Bill 4599, would increase the
school aid formula for funding the operation of alternative fuel
buses to 100%. Currently, schools in West Virginia can get funding
for 80% of the fuel and operating costs for all buses, including
conventional gasoline or diesel-powered versions.
     But HB 4599 reasons that since natural gas and some other
alternative fuel buses are cheaper to operate, the state can cover
100% of their fuel and other operating costs without actually paying
out more money to the schools.
     The West Virginia NGV Coalition has been aggressively supporting
the bills, asking members to participate in the hearings and do
mailings to their senators and delegates.
     Both of the bills were still in committee in early March, with
only about 10 days left in the legislative session. The assembly was
expected to hold a special session after the current one ends, to
finish up business.

Florida distributor asks for new rates

     Faced with a growing service area and competition from electric
utilities, City Gas of Florida is asking state regulators for a
package of incentive rates that would increase its total revenues by
about $8.6 million a year.
     The eastern Florida distributor has added 13,000 customers in
the last four years and expects growth to continue at more than 4% in
the coming years. Recent improvements have been made to serve
customers in Port St. Lucie, Brevard County and the Kennedy Space
Center.
     The proposed rate structure would include:
     * A special rate for natural gas vehicle customers.
     * Special summer rates for customers using gas cooling, to
offset peak demand for electric air conditioning.
     * New technology rates for commercial and industrial customers
installing gas cooling, gas boilers, etc..
     * Special rates for cogeneration customers.
     * A cheaper standby rate for customers transporting their own
supply.
     City Gas also is seeking a load-development tariff that would
allow it to market surplus transportation capacity and/or natural gas
through special short-term transactions. The tariff would include a
mechanism so any revenues from the program would be shared with firm
customers.

California NGVs not equivalent to ZEVs, CARB finds

          The California Air Resources Board took a pass on a
proposal to expand its zero emission vehicle mandate to include
natural gas vehicles, or "zero emission equivalents," as some natural
gas spokesmen term them.
     "The board basically didn't respond to it," said Jerry Martin, a
CARB spokesperson.
     Southern California Gas Co. offered testimony before the board
detailing how natural gas-powered vehicles are the practical
equivalent to electric vehicles when power plant emissions are
considered. This was based on the GRI- sponsored study by Energy
International, Inc. focusing on "full fuel cycle emissions"
associated with natural gas vehicles and electric vehicles in
Southern California (NGVN 5/94).
     Yet, when the issue was raised, Martin said, staffers told the
board that a primary concern with any internal combustion engine is
its tendency to pollute more with aging and thus lose its
"equivalence" to electric vehicles. Electric vehicle "emissions" do
not deteriorate over time.
     Martin also said that when citing these "full cycle" studies,
representatives often fail to consider emissions generated from
"getting the dinosaurs out of the ground."
     But the board does recognize the improvement of NGVs over other
combustion engines, he said, they simply did not act on the proposal
to group them as "equivalents" to electric vehicles.
     * NGVs aren't the only ones. Ford Motor has been investigating
some mysterious battery fires in two electric-powered Ecostar
vehicles, according to United Press International.
     The first fire occurred on May 2 as the battery in an Ecostar
leased by the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif.,
burst into flames. The second fire happened in El Monte, Calif.,
where an Ecostar at the California Air Resources Board caught on fire
while being recharged.
     Ford has parked all 34 Ecostars until it has completed an
investigation being conducted with battery supplier ABB of
Mississauga, Ontario. The investigation is focusing on the cells of
the sodium-sulfur battery.
     * The Dept. of Transportation (DOT) is soliciting comments on a
proposal to alter the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
Improvement Program (CMAQ) so that funding would be available for
private projects. About $6 billion in funds is available from 1992-97
for alternative fuel and other  transportation projects under CMAQ.
Written comments are due to June 20 under the Federal Highway
Administration/Federal Transit Administration Docket No. 94-11.
     * The American Petroleum Institute (API) has filed a complaint
with the Federal Trade Commission, charging that some recent ads
being placed by agricultural interests are deceptive and misleading.
     The complaint centers on ads placed in major national
publications by a group called "Agriculture for Clean Air" and the
Illinois Farmers Union, which cautions the public against using
gasoline additives that contain MTBE. API is especially miffed at how
the ads seem to imply that methanol, which is highly toxic, is the
same as MTBE.
     "The ad fails to mention that vehicles using ethanol or ETBE
emit more air toxics than those using MTBE when blended to an
equivalent oxygen content in the fuel," API said. "In addition,
emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, the precursors of
smog, are higher from vehicles using ethanol blends," API's complaint
said.
     * EDO Corp. said its Canadian subsidiary EDO Canada has received
a C$2.1 million order from Ontario Bus Industries (OBI)/Bus
Industries of America for EDO's LiteRider all-composite NGV fuel
cylinders. They will be roof-mounted on OBI's new Orion VI low-floor
buses. The seven-cylinder configuration should add less than 1,200
lbs. of weight to the vehicle. Comparable steel cylinders would have
added more than 3,500 lbs. and overwrapped aluminum cylinders would
have added more than 3,000 lbs. compared to the LiteRider, EDO said.
     * The West Virginia Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition said it has
won the U.S. Dept. of Energy's 1994 National Awards Program for
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy for its efforts in opening a
network of 12 NGV stations in the state. Seven more stations are
scheduled to open before the end of the year.
     * The American Public Transit Association reports that about
8.2% of 52,000 U.S. buses counted in a recent survey are powered by
alternative fuels, up from 5.9% last year.
     Of the 4,285 buses reported as using alternate power, almost
half use clean diesel with particulate traps, 22% are electric and
the majority of the rest runs on CNG, methanol and fuel combinations.
At least 1,300 more clean fuel buses are expected to be in service in
the next two years.
     * The Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook
for 1994 forecasts a drop in gasoline consumption as a result of
increased alternative fuel use. The decrease is expected to be 6%
from 1990 to 2010, according to EIA.
     The agency forecasts that AFVs will compose 2.3% of light-duty
vehicle sales in 1995; 10.6% in 2005 and 11.4% in 2010.
     In 2010, sales are predicted to be 26.4% CNG; 19.4% LPG; 12.2%
electric; 17.8% electric hybrid; 13% methanol and gasoline; and 8.6%
methanol and gasoline.

Utilities need to support NGV market, official says

     CNG appears to be the leading choice for a low-cost, low-
emission alternative fuel, but utilities need to take advantage of
what natural gas has to offer, said John Stark, director of fleet
services for Brooklyn Union Gas.
     Speaking at the American Gas Assn. operations conference in San
Francisco last month, Stark said many utility employees have stock in
their companies and want to see them grow, but utilities keep buying
gasoline for their fleets rather than natural gas.
     "No utility that I know of sells gasoline," he said. Utilities
spend thousands of dollars to advertise on the advantages of natural
gas, pointing out in the ads that it is low-priced, more
cleaner-burning than oil and domestically produced, Stark said.
However, when it comes to fleets, utilities use fuel which is
imported, high- priced, volatile and emits toxic pollutants, he
added.
     Stark acknowledges that some fleet managers were waiting for OEM
vehicles before getting involved in NGVs. "Wait no longer, they are
here," he said.
     Ford, Chrysler and General Motors are currently manufacturing
dedicated NGVs as part of their overall alternative fuels program.
The big three still maintain they are fuel neutral, as they are
testing a number of alternative fuels, Stark said. "But natural gas
is rapidly becoming the fuel of choice."
     Stark said Chrysler sees itself as the leader in OEM NGVs rather
than conversion vehicles. Its natural gas vehicle sales nearly
tripled this year compared to previous model years, from 445 for
model year 1993 to 1,106 for the early part of 1994. "This 150%
increase motivated Chrysler to greatly expand its product line," he
said.
     Chrysler has focused its efforts on the Ram series full-size
vans and passenger- equivalent wagons, also called the B-series CNG
vans and wagons. The B-series vans carry up to 14.4 equivalent
gallons of CNG and get up to 216 miles between fill- ups. Stark said
they were introduced in 1992 and have been continued into 1994.
     The Dodge Caravan and Voyager, passenger and cargo CNG minivans
were introduced in 1994. Stark said Chrysler claims its vans use what
is an exclusive natural gas sequential multiport fuel injection
system. The CNG vans carry an equivalent of 8.2 gallons of CNG and
can get up to 123 miles between fill-ups. The California Air
Resources Board certified the CNG minivans as ultra low emission
vehicles, he added.
     For model year 1995, a CNG Ram pickup and a CNG Dakota pickup
will be launched sometime in September or October. Chrysler offers
fleet purchase incentives of up to $2,000 per vehicle and special
small commercial buyer incentives totaling $1,500 per vehicle, he
said. In addition, the federal government offers a federal income tax
deduction of $2,000 and several utilities, such as Brooklyn Union,
offer purchase incentives of up to $1,000 per vehicle, Stark said.
     Stark said Ford's NGV program has been in full swing since 1984
with its NGV Ranger pickup truck. The company is working on its
Econoline medium- and heavy- duty trucks so they can run on natural
gas. Federal Express has taken some NGV Econoline vans and some P600
and F700 medium duty NGV trucks will be going to various fleets
around the country, Stark said.
     Ford's product development program could lead to the first U.S.
production of dedicated natural gas passenger sedans, the CNG-powered
Crown Victoria in 1996. For a three-year evaluation period, 50
prototypes have been placed in 23 utility fleets.
     The Crown Vic has a port-fuel injected 4.6-liter, V-8 engine,
and holds an equivalent of 10 gallons of CNG. Stark said Ford plans
to use a derivative of the Crown Vic CNG engine in future CNG
V-8-powered, F-series pickup and Econoline vans.
     The F-series pickup, which will be offered as early as this fall
in California, will be a bi-fuel CNG vehicle and hold up to three
cylinders, giving it a driving range of 150 miles, he said.
      Stark said GM has been striving to be the leader in the NGV
segment. The company has produced more than 2,600 dedicated NGV
pickups since 1992, and its 1994 production was to include bi-fuel
full-size pickups, Caprice Classics and Corsica sedans. However,
production has been halted for the rest of 1994 due to incidents of
fuel cylinder ruptures on the earlier pickups. Stark said GM says it
has shown its commitment to be a leader in the alternative fuel
vehicle (AFV) market and will be a leader in the AFV and NGV markets.
     GM has partnered with Ecotrans, a joint venture between a major
utility and an NGV system manufacturer/vendor. They have teamed up to
convert selected full- size pickups and trucks to dedicated NGVs.
This program has been put on hold temporarily.
     Japanese car manufacturers, Honda and Mazda, are also developing
dedicated NGVs. These prototypes are being tested in Japan, Stark
said.
     Construction equipment is also entering the natural gas market.
John Deere has developed a prototype CNG-powered backhoe/loader which
includes 10.3 equivalent gallons of CNG and can operate about five
continuous hours between fill-ups. Stark said the prototype may not
be available for two years.
     Natural gas is being used in compressors, forklifts, power
engines and other construction equipment, Stark said. Manufacturers
such as Tecogen, Hercules and Cummins Engine plan to build dedicated
OEM natural gas engines for transportation use. Ingersoll-Rand and
Grimmer Schmidt offer CNG compressors, and Clark and Yale offer
CNG-powered forklifts, he said.

Antibody Engineering
Becomes a Service

Oxford Molecular Group (Magdalen Centre, Oxford Science Park,
Sandford-on-Thames, Oxford OX4 4GA, U.K.; Fax: 086/578-4601) is
teaming up with MRC Collaborative Centre (1-3 Burtonhole Lane, Mill
Hill, London NW7 1AD, U.K.; Fax: 081/906-1395) to provide antibody
engineering service on behalf of pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies.

The goal of the partnership is to attract collaborative research
opportunities.  Oxford Molecular offers a computer-based approach
to drug design, and MRC offers laboratory expertise. The aim of the
antibody engineering service is to improve the characteristics of
existing antibodies at a late research stage or early clinical
phase of development. Apparently a need or demand exists for
centralized, multidisciplinary services for antibody design and
modification (engineering).

One aspect of the service will be humanization efforts, to make
mouse-derived monoclonal antibodies more compatible for human
therapeutic use. Numerous developmental efforts of the past were
scuttled when investigators discovered that the human body rejects
foreign proteins (surprise!). Other aspects of the engineering
service will entail improvements of antibody affinity and
specificity for binding to unique antigens often found on the
surface of cells.

Bayer Looks Into
Biocatalytic Synthesis

Enzymes are known for their ability to selectively catalyze
reactions in both aqueous and non-aqueous media. There is a growing
interest in the biocatalytic synthesis of specialty polymers since
such an approach can generate additional properties such as
chirality and biodegradability.  Biologically synthesized polymers
have been applied as absorbents, biodegradable materials, chiral
adsorbents, liquid crystals, and perm-selective membranes.

Bayer Corp. (1 Mellon Bank Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15258; Tel:
412/394-5500, Fax: 412/394-5534) has discovered a process for the
production of polyesters reacting a diol with an acid or acid ester
in the presence of a solid enzymes and supercritical fluids (U.S.
Patent 5,478,910).

Low molecular weight linear aliphatic oligoesters that are hydroxy
terminated have commercial significance for use in the manufacture
of polyurethane resins. The current commercial process is based on
acid/base catalyzed condensation polymerization between a
diacid/diester and a diol. The use of traditional catalysts is
limited because such catalysts tend to have an undesirable effect
on the subsequent polyurethane synthesis.

Supercritical fluids have been described as extraction solvents,
have been used in various industrial extraction processes, and have
been suggested as being useful for a variety of enzyme catalyzed
reactions. With supercritical fluids as the reaction medium, enzyme
enantioselectivity can be manipulated by the pressure of the
system.

In both enzymatic and non-enzyme catalyzed synthesis of oligoesters
and polyesters, it is difficult to control product molecular weight
in a predictable manner. All techniques described to date depend
upon changing the reaction time in order to manipulate molecular
weight. In the case of non-enzyme catalyzed oligo- and polyesters,
the final product typically contains cyclic ester by-products and
small amounts of residual catalyst, both of which can adversely
affect properties of products produced from those oligo- and
polyesters.

The Bayer innovation overcomes most of the above difficulties and
allows for the production of a wide variety of polyesters, where it
is relatively simple to produce a material of a desired molecular
weight by merely varying the pressure under which the
polyesterification or polytransesterification reaction is
conducted.

Affinity Makes
Safer Factor VIII

Hemophiliacs depend on the clotting substance Factor VIII, but the
possibility of AIDS contaminating the blood supply adds to their
burden. Screening blood donors helps. So does testing for AIDS
antibodies, although such tests miss latent virus. Regular Factor
VIII is an extract derived from pooled blood. Making sure that the
blood used is free of the AIDS virus is of concern to all
responsible manufacturers.

Baxter International (Deerfield, Illinois 60015; Tel: 708/948-2000,
Fax: 708/948-2887), one of the leading producers of Factor VIII
worldwide, has developed a process for purifying Factor VIII:C by
employment of a multiple immunoaffinity method.  First, Factor
VIII:C is pulled out of solution with an immobilized antibody that
specifically binds this clotting protein through hydrophobic
attraction. Next, the protein is eluted from the affinity matrix
with a desorbing, nonpolar solvent.

Then, the Factor VIII:C is passed through an affinity region, which
is an ion-exchange region capable of binding the protein while
allowing contaminants to pass through. Finally, the purified factor
is eluted from the affinity material and recovered.  The process is
described in U.S. Patent 5,470,954.

Other approaches to making Factor VIII safer, taken by other
suppliers, include the use of heat or solvent-detergents to
inactivate the virus.  The arrival of recombinant Factor VIII,
which is produced by cell culture rather than by extraction from
blood, circumvents the whole problem of AIDS contamination
altogether. The recombinant protein is more expensive than the
regular product, however, and some medical insurance companies have
balked at the higher cost.

While the cost of treating AIDS would be even greater, should
patients come down with this disease, the risk of contracting AIDS
from regular Factor VIII is very low, the insurers say. The extra-
purified, extracted material now becoming available improves the
situation even further and makes it competitive, in terms of
safety, with the recombinant version. Currently, recombinant
products have about a 20% share of the total Factor VIII market.

Method Purifies
Crude Proteins

David Naveh and John C. Tang of Schering Nederland B.V. (Van
Houten, Industriepark 1, NL-1381 MZ Weesp, The Netherlands; Tel:
0031-2940-62424, Fax: 0031-2940-18336) have invented an
ion-exchange chromatography technique that purifies proteins.  The
crude protein mixture contains one or more undesirable proteins of
unknown isoelectric points.  Naveh and Tang use either computer
simulation or isoelectric focusing gels to determine the
isoelectric points of proteins in the crude protein mixture.

The pH for the ion-exchange chromatography is adjusted to a point
between the ranges of isoelectric points of the protein fractions
to be separated.  Separation occurs when contact is made between
the ion-exchange resin and the crude protein mixture.  Since the
proteins in the first and second fractions are oppositely charged,
only one of the fractions binds to the ion-exchange resin.  U.S.
Patent 5,451,662, which protects the technique, also discloses
details on the purification of GM-CSF using a cation-exchange
resin.

Incyte Adds J&J
Subscription Database

Incyte Pharmaceuticals (3330 Hillview Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304;
Tel: 415/855-0555, Fax: 415/855-0572) has signed on  Johnson &
Johnson (New Brunswick, NJ 08903; Tel: 908/524-0400) as the sixth
subscriber to its genetic sequence and gene-expression database,
Lifeseq. Although financial terms were not disclosed, the
arrangment provides for payment of yearly subscription fees and on-
site access fees.

The addition of J&J brings to Incyte a minimum of $100 million from
all of the subscribers so far, which also include Abbott, Hoechst,
Novo Nordisk Pfizer, and Pharmacia & Upjohn. Notes Roy Whitfield,
president and CEO of Incyte, "The recent increase in the number of
Lifeseq subscribers is indicative of the growing realization that
the use of genomic sequence and expression information represents
an essential tool in pharmaceutical and new diagnostic product
development."

Incyte's database contains a wealth of genomic sequence and tissue-
specific expression information, encompassing 800,000 cDNA clones
to date.  The genetic data are obtained from over 800 tissue
samples in its in-house bank, a figure which is expanding. Incyte
believes it has the largest sequencing and bioinformatics operation
in the world, with an ability to screen as many as 4,000 partial
genes each day.

Subscribers to the  database use the genetic information to
identify new therapeutic targets for drug development, identify
human analogs of promising animal molecules, learn more about
particular disease processes, and understand the pharmacological
and toxicological impact of a new drug on human tissues.
Diagnostic applications are other uses of the genetic information.

Tissue-specific cDNA refers to the genes actually turned on, and
turned on uniquely, in the various bodily tissues.  While every
human cell possess the full set of genes (now thought to number
around 70,000), the process of differentiation during embryo
development results in the turning on and turning off of particular
genes in a way that gives each tissue its special characteristics.

Suppressor Proteins
Arrest AIDS Virus

Researchers at the University of Maryland have identified a new
family of proteins that may slow the progression of AIDS in people
who have been infected with the virus for a period of time but who
have not become sick.

At the University of Maryland, where Robert Gallo led the research
effort, scientists identified three closely related suppressor
proteins and isolated them from human immune cells.  When mixed in
a test tube with the AIDS virus, the three proteins worked in
concert to stop the virus from multiplying.  The proteins have the
names rantes, mip1-alpha, and mip1-beta.

At another research institute, Germany's Paul Ehrlich Institute
(Langen, Germany), scientists discovered a fourth suppressor
protein. It appears to be unrelated to the other three.  This
protein is equated with a previously known substance, interleukin-
16.

In test tubes, the proteins prevent the AIDS virus from
reproducing.  Scientists say they believe that patients with slowly
progressing AIDS may have higher levels of these HIV suppressors in
their bloodstreams than patients who get sick relatively quickly.

The discoveries are likely to increase research competition for new
treatments that can be based on these suppressor proteins.  Anthony
Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, believes that the discoveries open new avenues of drug
research. But the research teams themselves say they do not yet
know how the suppressor proteins work, nor have they been able to
prove that the proteins delay the onset of full-blown AIDS in some
patients.

These recent discoveries come from nearly 10 years of research in
which scientists have noticed that human immune system cells,
called CD-8+,  apparently elaborate proteins that seem to stop the
AIDS virus from replicating.  At the earlier time, they were not
able to identify the molecular structure of the proteins.

The Gallo team at Maryland has been making progress toward
understanding how the suppressor proteins might work and expects to
begin animal tests that can determine whether therapies based on
the newly discovered suppressor proteins are possible.

The joint venture between OraVax (Cambridge, MA; Tel: 617/494-1339)
and Pasteur-Merieux-Connaught announced the successful completion
of a Phase I clinical trial with their UreAB vaccine antigen
against Helicobacter pylori, the causative bacterial infection
underlying most cases of peptic ulcers and chronic gastritis.

In the U.S. alone, this infection affects 20% of the population
between ages 20 and 30 and more than 50% of the population below
age 60.  The infection causes the large fraction of the more than
5 million cases of peptic ulcers seen each year in the U.S. In
Japan, where the problem is even worse, the infection rate exceeds
80%.

Peptic ulcers and chronic gastritis currently are treated by two
principal classes of drugs that prevent gastric acid secretion, H2
receptor blockers and ATPase/proton pump inhibitors. H2 receptor
blockers include SmithKline Beecham's cimetidine (Tagamet), Merck's
famotidine (Pepcid), Lilly's nizatidine (Axid), and Glaxo's
ranitidine (Zantac) and have combined worldwide annual sales
totaling about $6 billion.

ATPase/proton pump inhibitors include the omeprazole sold by Merck
(Prilosec), Astra (Losec), and Takeda's lansoprazole (Takepron) and
have combined worldwide annual sales of about $1.5 billion.  Having
substantially  fewer sales are prostaglandin mimics, such as
Searle's Cytotec. The market additionally includes such OTC
products as Tums and Maalox.

If peptic ulcers and chronic gastritis can be prevented with a
vaccine, doing so will probably cut deeply into the sales of all
these different products -- good for the national healthcare bill
but bad for the suppliers of treatment drugs.

Anti-Staph Antibody
Production Expanded

North American Biologicals Inc. (Boca Raton, FL 33431-0701; Tel:
407/989-5800, Fax: 407/989-5801) has expanded its donor stimulation
program for StaphGAM, a product intended to prevent Staphylococcus
aureus  infections in hospitalized patients. In the United States,
approximately 3 million people run the risk of developing Staph
infections in hospitals.

The data gathered in this study will be used to assist NABI in
producing clinical trial quantities of StaphGAM, which is expected
to begin human Phase I trials in late 1996.

The company has presented preclinical data that indicated that
StaphGAM reduced the occurrence in animal models of S. aureus
endocarditis, an inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, by
up to 80%. According to company officials, in several animal
challenge models StaphGAM also significantly reduced the number of
Staph bacteria surviving in the blood, livers, and kidneys after
experimental infection.

The donor stimulation program currently under way is intended to
maximize antibody production in donors by evaluating the impact of
different dosing regimes and differing antibody collection
schedules. Once NABI has determined that StaphGAM is stimulating
the optimum levels of Staph-fighting antibodies in donors, the
company plans to expand the number of donors being immunized and
begin producing trial quantities of StaphGAM in mid-1996.

NABI's donor stimulation program for StaphGAM, which was initiated
in September 1995, comprises 70 healthy adults who are vaccinated
with StaphVAX, the staph vaccine that NABI has licensed from the
National Institutes of Health (NIH), to stimulate the production of
high levels of antibodies against staph in plasma donors.

These antibodies are then purified and formulated into a specific
polyclonal antibody product, called StaphGAM.  StaphGAM may provide
immediate protection to patients who are at risk of contracting
hospital-related staph infections.  These individuals include
severe trauma patients and those undergoing cardiac vascular graft
and joint-replacement surgery.

Isis Throws Out
Antisense Molecule

Isis Pharmaceuticals (2292 Faraday Ave., Carlsbad, CA 92007; Tel:
619/931-9200, Fax: 619/931-9639) has decided not to continue
further development of its antisense compound 2105 (afovirsen),
intended for the treatment of genital warts. The substance is an
antiviral that prevents the expression of a protein essential for
the replication of human papilloma virus, the cause of the warts.

A recently completed Phase II study was designed to ascertain trend
information regarding the effectiveness of multiple doses of the
substance in conjunction with cryosurgery, which is a treatment
currently employed.

The data showed that a trend in favor of three-times-a-week dosing
over two times a week, but the trend was not sufficient to justify
further expense to continue the drug's development. In making this
decision, Isis considered the market potential and saw an
insufficient possible reward in light of the financial requirements
and technical risks that would be involved in creating and testing
a sustained-release formulation.

Stem-Cell Therapy
Shows Promise

Somatix Therapy (850 Marina Village Pkwy., Alameda, CA 94501-1034;
Tel: 510/748-3000, Fax: 510/769-8533) has tested a stem-cell gene
therapy in a Phase I human clinical trial against chronic
graulomatous disease and found encouraging results. The disease is
a rare, inherited disorder in which granulocytes (the major type of
white blood cells) fail to produce oxidizing agents needed to kill
bacteria and fungi.  In about one-third of patients, the disease
arises from a defect in the p47phox gene, resulting in an inability
to produce a protein subunit of the enzyme that generates the
microbe-killing oxidants.

The clinical trial, a collaboration of Somatix, Baxter Healthcare's
Immunotherapy Division, and the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, took patients' blood and isolated the stem
cells, which then were genetically modified and returned to the
patients on an individual basis.  Retroviral vectors were used for
the genetic engineering.

Progenics Licenses
Melanoma Vaccine

Progenics Pharmaceuticals (Old Saw Mill River Road, Tarrytown, NY
10591; Tel: 914/789-2800) has licensed a therapeutical vaccine for
melanoma from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New
York).  Called GMK, the vaccine consists of a ganglioside
conjugate, one of a new class being developed by the company.

Gangliosides are complexes of carbohydrates and lipids found on the
surface of cells.  In particular, GM2 ganglioside is present in
approximately 95% of melanoma cells.  The company has conjugated
this ganglioside to the hemocyanin of the keyhole limpet, which
serves as a protein carrier of the substance.

In clinical trials, patients vaccinated with this conjugate, called
GMK, developed anti-GM2 antibodies that were capable of
specifically killing melanoma cells. Melanoma is the most deadly
type of skin cancer and is growing at the fastest rate of any
cancer in the industrialized world.  In the U.S. alone, about
37,000 new melanoma cases were reported in 1994, and by 2000 it is
estimated that 1 in 90 Americans will develop this disease.

Two large Phase III clinical trials of Progenics' GMK vaccine are
to start in early 1996 and will involve high-risk patients in the
U.S. and Europe. The company also plans clinical trials in 1996 of
a different ganglioside conjugate vaccine for other cancers.

Alpha Interferon
Ok'd for Melanoma

Schering-Plough (1 Giralda Farms, Madison, NJ 07940-1000; Tel:
201/822-7000, Fax: 201/822-7048) obtained FDA approval of its
Intron brand of interferon-a2b for use as an adjuvant ot surgery in
the treatment of malignant melanoma. The drug is intended to curb
relapses of the cancer.

A recent clinical study showed that the alpha-interferon increased
the median overall survival of patients by more than 12 months and
the median relapse-free survival by nine months. The five-year
survival rate was improved by 24%, and the five-year relapse-free
rate by 42%. Fatigue and flu-like symptoms were the predominant
side effects.

Alpha-interferon has numerous approved medical indications already
(as well as several unofficial ones), and the new development
extends the approved applications.  According to market-research
firm BCC Inc. (25 Van Zant St., Norwalk, CT 06855; Tel: 203/853-
4266), alpha-interferon had total worldwide sales of $1.35 billion
in 1994, of which cancer applications accounted for two-thirds and
infectious disease applications for one-third. Total sales for
cancer application were projected to grow at 4.9% annually through
2000, while infection uses were projected to grow at only 1.0%.

Urogenital Factor
Inhibits Prostate Cancer

Scientists at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX) have
identified and sequenced the gene for ps20, a protein able to
inhibit the growth of human prostate cancer cells in test tube.
Protein ps20  activates urogenital growth inhibitory factor UGIF),
the actual protein that mediates the proliferation and
differentation of prostate cancer cells. The research on ps20 is
being done by David Rowley, in the Department of Cell Biology, who
has now produced a recombinant version.

Rowley previously isolated UGIF from cells of the rat fetal
urogenital sinus organ. This substance was shown to inhibit DNA
synthesis and cell proliferation of human prostatic carcinoma
cells.  The researchers speculate that a reduction in UGIF leads to
poorly differentiated cells associated with the progression of
prostatic carcinomas, while an adequate presence of UGIF promotes
differentiation and thereby inhibits growth. If UGIF activity can
be enhanced (for example, through the action of ps20), then the
typical progression of cancer cells may be inhibited. A U.S. patent
has been issued on the use of UGIF for the treatment of prostate
cancer.

Sheffield Medical Technologies (1111 Bagby, Houston, TX 77002; Tel:
713/739-8221, Fax: 713/739-1131) holds an option to exclusively
license both the ps20 and the UGIF technology.

Angiogenesis Blockers
Arrest Metastasis

Bristol-Myers Squibb (Princeton, NJ 08543-4000; Tel: 609/252-4000,

prevent the abnormal formation of blood vessels and thereby block
the growth of primary and metastatic cancers. The deal encompasses
thalidomide, thalidomide analogs, and Angiostatin protein.

Angiogenesis research was pioneered by Judah Folkman, who observed
that cancerous tissues are fed by newly grown blood vessels
sprouting from existing arteries.  These blood vessels constitute
a "nutritional highway" feeding the growth of tumors.  Entremed, a
privately held firm headed by Leon Rosenberg, licensed
antiangiogenic technologies developed by Folkman. Bristol-Myers

Researchers Harness
Hematopoietic Stem Cells

The progenitor stems cells of the bone marrow that give rise to all
the various blood cells are being used in several ways for the
treatment of cancer and cancer-related therapy. Physicians want to
use high-dose chemical or radiation treatment, but the untoward
side effect is a destruction of bone-marrow cells and consequently
a severe depletion in the number of infection-fighting white blood
cells and clot-promoting platelets. To find any use of the better
cancer-fighting effect of high-dose treatment, this problem has to
be surmounted.

Cell Genesys (344 Lakeside Drive, Foster City, CA 94404; Tel:
415/358-9600, Fax: 415/358-0803) seeks to use stem cells for cancer
gene therapy. Cell Genesis genetically engineered the stem cells so
that they recognize a specific protein on the surface of tumor
cells, then transplanted them into mice.  Over 80% of the mice
receiving a lethal injection of malignant tumor cells survived at
least 17 weeks and showed no evidence of residual tumor when tested
by a highly sensitive PCR assay for tumor-specific DNA.

Increasing the number of stem cells as an adjunct to high-dose
cancer treatment helps patients resist the sometimes fatal
infections that may develop as a serious side effect.  The stem
cells can be increased either in the body or outside it.

Aastrom Biosciences (24 Frank Wright Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48106;
Tel: 313/930-5555), a collaborator of RPR Gencell, takes the
approach of increasing stem cells outside the body.  In a clinical
trial at the University of Texas's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the
feasibility and safety of an ex vivo method of stem-cell production
was demonstrated as an adjunct to autologous bone-marrow
transplantation, itself given as an adjunct to cancer therapy.
Stem cells from 10 breast-cancer patients were collected,
individually cultivated in the company's automated cell-production
system, then returned to the patients.

Taking a similar approach is Systemix (3155 Porter Drive, Palo
Alto, CA 94304; Tel: 415/856-4901).  The difference is that the
company isolates a specific variant of stem cells, the
CD34+Thy+Lin- type. A Phase I/II clinical test with multiple
myeloma patients showed that the infusion of these cells appeared
to help the patients.

Stem cells, and their progeny, can also be mobilized within the
body.  That's the way Immunex (51 University St., Seattle,
Washington 98101; Tel: 206/587-0430, Fax: 206/587-0606) sees it.
The company has just obtained FDA approval to use its Leukine brand
of GM-CSF (generically called sargramostim) as a growth factor to
stimulate peripheral blood progenitor cells and for use after
transplantation of such cells. The drug is administered to patients
before collecting peripheral blood and isolating the progenitor
cells by apheresis.  The procedure cuts down the number of
apheresis runs that must be carried out.  Peripheral progenitor
cells are reinfused into patients after their high-dose cancer
therapy.

Rivals to Immunex and competing against each another, Amgen (1840
DeHavilland Drive, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320-1789; Tel: 805/447-1000)
and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (500 Arcola Road, Collegeville, PA 19426;
Tel: 610/454-8000, Fax: 610/454-3813) use a different growth
factor, G-CSF, on peripheral blood cells. Amgen's product, Neupogen
(generically known as filgrastim) has obtained approval for this
application, the fourth indication of the drug. RPR, still in
clinical trials, says its version of G-CSF, generically called
lenograstim, may be more potent than Amgen's product.

Amgen points out that in the U.S. alone, about 17,000 cell
transplants were performed in 1994, of which 9,000 were peripheral
blood progenitor-cell transplants, representing a 30%-35% increase
in the number of such procedures over the previous year.  This
increase results from both an increase in the number of patients
eligible for treatment and a 50% conversion from bone-marrow
transplants.

The latter are not only more invasive and therefore more risky than
peripheral blood transplants, but also more costly in dollar terms.
The main cost advantage with peripheral blood-transplantation
methods is that patients can recover outside the hospital after the
blood cells have been collected.  Also, hospital stays after the
transplantation are shorter, which saves money as well.

Another Gene Defect
in Breast Cancer

An international team of scientists, which includes a research
group at Duke Medical Center (Durham, NC) led by P. Andrew Futreal
and the Institute of Cancer Research (Surrey, U.K.) led by Dr.
Michael Stratton, has identified a second major breast-cancer gene
that makes some women highly likely to get the disease.  Thirty-
eight others from six countries were involved in the research
effort.

The gene is called BRCA2, and it follows the identification of
BRCA1 last year.  Together, the genes account for about 90% of
breast cancers from inherited susceptibility, with BRCA2
responsible for about 40%. It has earlier been announced that
scientists had narrowed the search for BRCA2 to a small area of
chromosome 13.

In a related development, scientists at Myriad Genetics Inc. (Salt
Lake City, UT) announced that they had recovered the entire BRCA2
gene.  The company says it plans to use it in combination with
BRCA1 to develop a test for predisposition to hereditary breast
cancer.

Only about 5-10% of breast cancer cases are now thought to come
from inheriting a faulty gene.  The cause of the vast majority of
cases of breast cancer is not known, although scientists are
investigating possible hormonal and other triggers.

Like BRCA1, the new-found gene seems to suppress cancer when it is
working normally.  But when BRCA2 is defective, this brake is lost.
In the short term, location of the second gene should lead to more
tests to help families with high rates of breast cancer  learn
which members are affected.

Centacor's Results
Spell Good News

Centocor (200 Great Valley Pkwy., Malvern, PA 19355-1307; Tel:
610/651-6000) called an early halt of its clinical study of ReoPro
because the drug has proven so effective in treating patients with
unstable angina. The study was scheduled to run until late 1996 or
early 1997, but early results showed that patients who were given
ReoPro intravenously had a nearly 70% reduction in deaths.

Angina is a disorder in which narrowing of arteries diminishes
blood supply to the heart. The clinical trial that was halted
involved patients who were given coronary angioplasty to open the
clot-clogged arteries. ReoPro prevents platelet cells in the blood
from sticking together and initiating clot formation in arteries,
which in this instance helps prevent the artery from re-closing due
to a new formation of blood clots.

ReoPro costs $1,350 per treatment, but Centocor's earlier studies
found that it saves $3,000 per patient in overall medical care
costs by preventing complications.  Patients receive one course of
treatment per angioplasty.

In 1995, ReoPro produced revenues of about $22 million (the product
is licensed to Eli Lilly, who pays Centocor a percentage in royalty
income)  This year it is estimated that the revenues should jump to
$100 million, and by the year 2000, it is estimated that  revenues
could be $782 million.  As a result of the anticipated revenue
stream, Centocor, after a decade of losses, could report positive
earnings this year.  Profitability could come as soon as the third
quarter of this year.

Yet Another
Interleukin

The "lymphocyte chemoattractant factor (LCF)" first described in
1982 by Boston University's David Center, William Cruikshank, and
Hardy Kornfeld, has been identifed now as interleukin-16. The
cytokine stimulates the growth of CD4+ T cells, the very ones
infected by HIV/AIDS. Besides binding to the CD4 receptor and
stimulating T-cell growth, IL-16 also stimulates the migration of
lymphocytes, eosinophils, and monocytes.  Expression of IL-16 is
thought to be an early response to histamine, a messenger hormone
of the immune system.

The scientists have characterized the gene that codes for IL-16 and
have produced a recombinant product in both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic expression systems. Not only might IL-16 itself have
potential use as an AIDS-fighting material; antagonists to IL-16
could also relieve the bronchial constriction characteristic of
asthma or could treat T-cell lymphoma by blocking IL-16's binding
to the CD4 receptor.  Licensing of the IL-16 and its technology is
being handled through Research Corp. Technologies (101 N. Wilmot
Road, Tucson, AZ 85711-3335; Tel: 520/748-4400, Fax: 520/748-0025).

Imaging Antibodies
Make Progress

On Oct. 17, 1995, an FDA advisory-panel meeting deferred a decision
regarding the approval of CEA-Scan, from Immunomedics Inc. (300
American Road, Morris Plains, NJ 07950; Tel: 201/605-8200, Fax:
201/605-8282), to another FDA panel comprised of specialists in
diagnostic imaging and oncology. Immunomedics now responds by
finalizing its presentation to this new panel.  It believes it has
made progress toward agreements on all issues raised by the FDA.

CEA-Scan is in the final stages of regulatory review in the U.S.
and Europe.  The company is also planning to commence clinical
trials and to seek regulatory approval of this product in Japan. In
contrast to other countries, Japan requires that the pivotal
clinical trials be conducted in Japan.  Therefore, the company
cannot submit its final clinical data from U.S. studies.

CEA-Scan should be able to image cancers other than colorectal,
such as esophagal, medullary thyroid, breast, lung, stomach, bile
duct, pancreatic, ovarian, uterine, and cervical cancers. Together
these comprise more than 600,000 new cancer cases in the U.S. on an
annual basis.  The two most prevalent are lung and breast cancers,
and it is for that reason that Immunomedics is pursuing additional
uses of CEA-Scan by undertaking pivotal trials in these cancer
types. The lung-cancer pivotal trial is going on, and the protocol
for the breast-cancer trial is being designed for submission to the
FDA.

Since there are other new methods being developed to better assess
the malignancy or spread of a tumor found on mammography, the
company has taken more time than originally planned to study the
potential of CEA-Scan in this disease. The company already knows
from its Phase II clinical results that CEA-Scan can be
complimentary to mammography for diagnosing a breast tumor.
Further, it can reveal involvement of the axilla, which is
prognostically important when doing a presurgical evaluation.

A single injection of CEA-Scan can also reveal spread of cancer to
other parts of the body, which otherwise requires a battery of
imaging tests, such as CAT scans, bone scans, and the like.

The company believes there are opportunities for the use of CEA-
Scan in breast cancer, which affects approximately one in nine
women in the U.S. with an annual mortality of about 46,000.  Phase
III trials must be performed before Immunomedics can be sure of the
efficacy of CEA-Scan for breast-cancer detection.

Other Immunomedics products are progressing well in regulatory
reviews around the world.  LeukoScan, for imaging and diagnosing
sites of infection and inflammation, is progressing well in
regulatory review in Europe, where it was filed in August 1995 for
the detection of sites of infection in the extremities,
particularly osteomyelitis. The company anticipates an inspection
of its manufacturing facilities by the European regulatory
representatives during January of this year. Because of all of this
regulatory activity for CEA-Scan in the U.S. and Europe, and for
LeukoScan in Europe, the company has delayed the filing of
LeukoScan in the U.S.

The pivotal trial for the appendicitis indication for LeukoScan has
been progressing well, and the company is already halfway through
the planned patient accrual.  Patient enrollment for the prosthetic
joint infection or inflammation protocol has been much slower than
originally projected.

Other uses of LeukoScan are being considered for additional trials.
Therefore, at least one other application for this product will
begin clinical studies during 1996.

Other Immunomedics imaging products, LymphoScan and AFP-Scan, are
progressing well in clinical trials.  As Orphan Drug products,
these have a more limited clinical application and have therefore
been moving slower through clinical trials.

With substantial input from the FDA and the oncological community,
a Phase III pivotal trial protocol for LymphoScan, as an imaging
agent for staging non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, is still being designed
by the company.

Because of the rarity of the diseases in the U.S. for which the
company's AFP-Scan is designed -- for diagnosing cancers of the
testes, ovary, and liver -- it has been necessary for the company
to seek clinical testing sites abroad.

New Outlet for
Tumor Marker Test

AMDL Inc. (222 Sutter St., Suite 401, San Francisco, CA 94108; Tel:
415/395-7830, Fax: 415/296-7448) announced that International
Cancer Diagnostics L.L.C. (ICD), a joint venture between AMDL and
Briana Bio-Tech Inc., has signed an agreement with STOCS Inc. for
distribution of AMDL's DR-70 cancer tumor-marker detection test
through a chain of reference laboratories in Indonesia.

Under the terms of the agreement, ICD will receive a minimum
revenue payment of  US$5.24 million for the DR-70 test kits on an
established annual schedule over the next four years.  Additional
revenue is possible based on sales exceeding the minimum guaranteed
levels.

This agreement is the first of a number of agreements to be entered
into by ICD with distributors in Europe, Asia, South America, and
India.  Testing of the product in Indonesia will begin at a major
university during the first quarter of this year, with sales
anticipated in the second quarter of the same year. ICD is
guaranteed a regular schedule of revenues from STOCS, increasing
tenfold over the first four years. STOCS and its affiliated
laboratories will move quickly to secure regulatory clearance for
the Indonesian market.

In February 1995, AMDL Inc. and Briana Bio-Tech formed
International Cancer Diagnostics to market and distribute AMDL's
tumor-marker detection system.  The DR-70 test currently is cleared
for marketing in Canada for use in diagnosing lung cancer. The DR-
70 testing is also undergoing clinical trials in Germany for
detection of various types of cancer.

NovaDx to Market
Arthritis Blood Test

NovaDx International Inc. (11526 Sorrento Valley Road, Suite F, San
Diego, CA 92121; Tel: 619/793-5976, Fax: 619/793-5978) is preparing
to commence the marketing of its lead product, Chondrex, an in
vitro blood test for arthritis that detects YKL-40, an arthritis-
related glycoprotein.

The product is ready to be manufactured approximately six months
ahead of schedule and the company is seeking corporate partners for
product manufacture and commercialization.  Two formats of the test
are being developed: ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and
immunoradiometric assay.  Both test formats use specially designed
and labeled antibodies to form a sandwich around YKL-40 that signal
the presence of arthritis. The immunoradiometric test uses
radiologic labels, and the ELISA uses a colorimetric label.

Chondrex test is NovaDx's first product. It is in preclinical
trials at various sites in the United States, Canada, and Europe.
Besides this one, the company also is developing tests for
osteoporosis and other chronic diseases.

More Intense
Attack on Fat

Everybody likes to eat, but most people don't want to pay the
penalty of gaining weight. "If it tastes good, it must be
fattening" seems to be the common plaint. Without self-control and
making changes in food choices, individuals may turn to diet aids,
such as amphetamine-based appetite suppressants.   Researchers are
now taking a new approach, based on a growing understanding of how
the body regulates fat storage and the sensation of satiety -- the
feeling that you've eaten enough. The research offers new targets
for drug development in this field.

The finding by Jeffrey Friedman, Rockefeller University, of an OB
("obesity) gene, its licensing to Amgen (1840 De Havilland Drive,
Thousand Oaks, CA 91320; Tel: 805/447-2303), and its recombinant
expression by scientists at Hoffmann-La Roche (340 Kingsland St.,
Nutley, NJ 07110-1199; Tel: 201/562-2232) were reported in AGN
(August).

The protein specified by the OB gene is called leptin, a peptide
hormone that, when injected into a mouse brain, results in reduced
food intake and a reduction in body weight among specially made,
obese mice. Leptin (fron the Greek, meaning "thin") appears to act
on neural pathways that control eating, energy metabolism, and body
weight. As fat builds up, fat cells release leptin to curb the
appetite and make the body use up excess fat.

The news continues with two further developments. Millenium
Pharmaceuticals (640 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA 02139-4815; Tel:
617/374-9480) has identified, cloned, and isolated the brain's
receptor for leptin, called OB-R. This gene in mice sits on a part
of chromosome 4 known to contain the so-called "db" gene, which
also plays a role in obesity, although it is not yet firmly proven
that  the OB-R gene and the db gene are one and the same.

The finding of the leptin receptor is significant. Although leptin
may have a future as a weight-controlling drug (and Amgen certainly
thinks so),  initial human studies last year have shown that most
obese persons are not deficient in leptin but, in fact, have
elevated levels of this fat-suppressive hormone. The fault may lie
instead with a receptor unresponsive to leptin. This seems to be
the case in db-obese mice.

Besides the OB-R leptin receptor, Millenium is on the trail of
others leads relating to the genetic basis for obesity.  Last year,
its scientists found another obesity-connected gene in mice, called
the "tub" gene. The company's research on obesity (and on diabetes)
is being financially supported by Hoffmann-La Roche.

Even more recently, Stephen Bloom at the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School of Hammersmith Hospital (London, U.K.) reports new
information about an intestinal protein called glucogen-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1).  After a meal, the intestines secrete GLP-1,
which then signals the pancreas to start producing insulin.
Insulin is the hormone that prompts body cells to take in dietary
glucose from the bloodstream and start using it. Bloom now finds
that GLP-1 also tells the brain that enough food has been consumed,
in other words, gives the sensation of satiety.   Thus, the GLP-1
is a natural appetite suppressant.

It now seems clear that the biological regulation of appetite, body
mass, and metabolism is complex and interrelated.  Undoubtedly,
more targets for potential therapeutic intervention will be
revealed in the future.  What, for instance, comprises the body's
threshhold for sensing "excessive" fat?  What drives the
individual, mechanistically and biochemically, to seek out food?
Why (and how) do certain foods appeal and others do not?  Can the
body's channeling of metabolism toward muscle or fat distribution
be influenced? Until more answers come in and the new drugs arrive,
it looks like we'll just have to continue our efforts to resist
that second helping.

What's Ahead
for 1996?

Seeing into the future can be a bit tricky.  We're reminded of the
Coney Island fortune teller who predicted we'd soon take a journey
over water.  The next day it rained and in the course of our
perigrinations we stepped over a puddle, fulfilling the prophecy.

Predicting this year's unfolding of biotechnology events is
something like that Coney Island experience: If they're general
enough, predictions surely will come to pass, like saying some
biotechnology companies in 1996 will probably succeed while others
will probably have to pack it in. Some products in clinical trials
will pass, while others will fail.

Ah, but which ones?  If that could be known ahead of time, one
could make a fortune.  Some people, of course, believe that test-
tube experiments and preclinical studies with animal models can
foretell the future -- how the candidate drugs will behave in
humans. And a lot of bets are placed on such forecasts.  One of the
big events of the year just past is the recognition that some
biotechnology efforts may fail, just as surely as some will
succeed. We may not know precisely which category any particular
venture may fall into, but just the mere recognition that failure
may occur represents a far cry from biotechnology's earlier, heady
days of overconfidence. Building in plans for the unexpected
"impossibilities" provides companies with mechanisms in place to
let them cope with uncertainty and survive.

Forecasting is not all speculation, of course, although it can be
wishful thinking.  If a product passes its trials, and if  it
receives regulatory approval, and if  it captures an assumed
percentage share of its available market, then a reasonable
forecast of its possible sales can be made and the manufacturing
capacity to fulfill that demand can be rationally planned.  The
"trick" lies in being as objective (at least with oneself) in
making business forecasts as in designing laboratory experiments.

Some forecasting is done by extrapolating from the past and
present, in light of unfolding forces for change. On this basis,
predicting biotechnology events in 1996 is made a little easier by
considering several discernible trends.

Virtualization of the pharmaceutical industry will accelerate.  Big
pharma surrounds itself with drug-discovery firms to fulfill its
research needs, while biotechnology companies surround themselves
with contract manufacturers. It's cheaper and less committal than
hiring in these functions. Marketing may become the next function
to be outsourced.

Differentation of the biotechnology industry will become more
transparent. Companies divide into those seeking to commercialize
biomolecules and those seeking to commercialize chemical molecules
acting on biological targets. They also divide into discoverers of
candidate targets for therapeutic intervention and developers of
actual drug candidates.

The struggle to survive will become more intense. It getting harder
to raise money to sustain research in view of coming cuts in the
federal budget. Biotechnology companies will increasingly be judged
on their ability to actually deliver products for sale.

M&A Picks Up
in Health Care

According to investment firm Hambrechst & Quist (1 Bush St., San
Francisco, CA 94104; tel. 415/576-3300), merger and acquisition
activity in health care services will continue to accelerate in
1996, particularly among home care, physician practice management
and HMOs. "Health care reform has driven the health services
industry toward consolidation," James Streator, managing director
of Hambrecht & Quist's health services group, observes. "Many of
the markets targeted by service companies are either fragmented or
undergoing significant consolidation."

In 1995, 82 mergers and acquisitions took place among health care
services companies, representin galmost $14 billion in transaction
value.  These figures compare with 69 such deals worth $20.7
billion in 1994 and 61 deals valued at $16.5 billion in 1993.
Streator adds that "Continued focus on cost containment and quality
standards will characterize health care services in 1996."

Financing activity is also anticipated to increase in 1996,
particularly in information services and physician management. In
1995, 41 equity offerings were made in the health services sector,
both initial and follow-on, raising a total of $3.5 billion. This
compares with 39 offerings in 1994 for $1.8 billion and 33
offerings in 1993 for $1.4 billion.

AGN notes that consolidation in the health services sector
translates into fewer but more powerful customers for products that
the biotechnology industry, pharmaceutical industry and medical
device industry have for sale.

Biogen's b-IFN
Closer to Market

Biogen Inc. (14 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142; Tel:
617/679-2000, Fax: 617/679-2617) announced that a Central Nervous
System Advisory Committee convened by the FDA has recommended that
the FDA approve Biogen's Avonex interferon-beta-la, for treatment
of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Biogen officials believe Avonex represents a major improvement in
the treatment of MS because it is the first and only drug to show,
in a blinded clinical trial, that it slows the progression of
disability and reduces the frequency of exacerbations. The FDA
Advisory Committee recommendation was based on data from a Phase
III clinical trial, in which 40% fewer patients on Avonex
progressed one or more units on the Expanded Disability Status
Scale (EDSS) than patents on placebo. The EDSS is the standard
measure of disease progression in MS.

In addition, patients receiving Avonex in the trial experienced 32%
fewer exacerbations of the disease than patients on placebo.
Further studies, using gadolium-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI), showed a statistically significant reduction in the number
and volume of active lesions in treated patients compared to
placebo patients.

Side effects seen in the trial were modest and largely involved
flu-like symptoms characteristic of all interferon drugs.  There
were minimal injection-site reactions.

Biogen, based on the findings of the Advisory Committee, is
optimistic that it will be proceeding to commercialization soon
after the final inspection of its manufacturing facilities by the
FDA.

Genotyping is the process of analyzing the genetic make-up of
families or populations to isolate a disease-causing gene common to
those in the group.  Using automated DNA sequencing and genetic
data-analysis systems developed by Perkin-Elmer's Applied
Biosystems Division, researchers have discovered the origins of
juvenile  diabetes, Duschenne muscular dystrophy, colon cancer, a
form of  breast cancer, and many other debilitating and deadly
diseases.

Perkin-Elmer is the leading global supplier of analytical and

Allegro Biologics
Goes to Apotex

Having lost financial support from Eli Lilly with regard to its
CD11b monoclonal antibodies, and having sold off its immune
modulation business to Genetics Insitute (AGN, October), Repligen
(1 Kendall Square, Bldg. 700, Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel: 617/225-
6000) now has sold off its Allegro Biologics operation to Apotex
USA (New York, NY).

The latter is the U.S. subsidiary of the largest Canadian-owned
pharmaceutical company. Allegro Biologics provides contract
services to the biopharmaceutical industry and has both process-
development laboratories and cGMP manufacturing facilities. Besides
acquiring Allegro, Apotex will also take over Repligen's protein A
and diagnostic reagents business.

That leaves Repligen with its recombinant platelet factor-4.  In a
recent clinical trial, this protein safely and effectively reversed
the anticoagulant effects of heparin in patients undergoing
diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Repligen hopes the rPF-4
ultimately will serve as an alternative to protamine, which
currently has use for reversing heparin's effects.  Protamine now
is used to neutralize heparin after all 500,000 open heart
surgeries done annually in the U.S. and in a portion of the U.S.'s
900,000 diagnostic cardiac catheterizations.

Heparin itself is an inhibitor of the clot-promoting enzyme,
thrombin.  While it is needed to keep blood flowing during
cardiosurgical procedures, the problem with heparin is that it may
cause capillary bleeding after close-up if it remains active. While
neutralizers of heparin are in demand, it is important to note that
better forms of, or safer alternatives to, heparin  are either
becoming available or are in development.

Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (500 Arcola Road, Collegeville, PA 19426; Tel:
610/454-8000, Fax: 610/454-3813) has obtained a worldwide but
nonexclusive license to single-chain antibody technology from Enzon
(40 Kingsbridge Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854-3998; Tel: 908/980-
4500), which itself inherited the technology from Genex when it had
to retrench. RPR will use the technology for the intracellular
expression of SCA proteins and for targeted vectors in the fields
of cell and gene therapy. RPR Gencell plans to apply the technology
to its gene-therapy programs in cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
and immunology.

Enzon receives $1 million from RPR for the deal, plus additional
payments on achieving specified product-development milestones. The
deal also includes royalty payments based on future sales of
products incorporating the single-chain antibody technology.

Single-chain antibodies provide the binding capability of
antibodies but leaves off the Fc fragment so that the proteins can
more easily penetrate tissues and will be less allergenic. The
delivery and intracellular expression of genes coding for SCA
proteins may have particular value for the selective inhibition of
intracellular functions associated with disease conditions.
Additionally, SCAs may allow for a selective targeting of cells for
transfection or transduction with viral and nonviral vectors.

Seragen Forms
Canadian Unit

Seragen Inc. (97 South St., Hopkinton, MA 01748; Tel: 508/435-2331)
formed Seragen Biopharmaceuticals Ltd., a privately held Canadian
operating company to be located in Montreal.

In the private financing, the new company raised C$13.5 million
from a group of six Canadian investors.  Included in the investor
group are Sofinov, a subsidiary of Caisse de Depot et placement du
Quebec, Societe Innovatech du Grand Montreal, MDS Health Ventures,
Health Care and Biotechnology Fund, Canadian Medical Discoveries
Fund, and Royal Bank Capital Corp.

The Canadian investors will own 51% of the new company and will be
granted warrants to purchase 519,033 shares of Seragen Inc. common
stock at US$8.79 per share.  Seragen Inc., with its contribution of
the technology and prior laboratory and clinical development, will
own 49% of the new company.

Seragen Biopharmaceuticals will conduct research and development
and clinical trials of Seragen's proprietary fusion toxin products
in Canada.  The new company will also market and receive royalties
from sales of Seragen products in Canada for the applications
Seragen has retained under its prior agreements with Eli Lilly,
Seragen's partner for the development of fusion toxins having
cancer applications.

The Canadian affiliate will bear a portion of the costs of
Seragen's clinical trials for HIV and psoriasis, thereby relieving
Seragen of up to C$5.3 million of costs, which Seragen would
otherwise have incurred. Seragen Biopharmaceuticals could also
receive significant tax rebates on qualifying R&D -- on the order
of $2 million to $3 million over the next several years.

Initial plans call for expanding to several Canadian sites the
Phase III clinical trials regarding an application to cutaneous T-
cell lymphoma. The IND application was recently approved by
Canada's Health Protection Branch, and one Canadian site in Toronto
has already been initiated.

The company also plans to conduct a Phase II trial involving an HIV
application  and possibly part of a Phase III trial in a psoriasis
application.

Seragen's fusion toxins link the diphtheria toxin to a hormone or
growth factor that targets  a specific receptor on the surface of
disease-causing cells.  The diphtheria toxin is one of the most
potent poisons in nature, possessing cytotoxic activity that
enables it to destroy targeted cells by shutting down protein
biosynthesis, in this case being harnessing to destroy diseased
cells. In its natural state, the diphtheria toxin rides along on a
"universal" targeting material, but in Seragen's products the toxin
is made to selectively destroy only the specifically targeted
cells.

Cadus Pursues
Signal Transduction

Cadus Pharmaceutical Corp. (777 Old Saw Mill River Road, Tarrytown,
NY 10591-64705; Tel: 914/345-3344, Fax: 914/345-3565) formed in
1992 to discover drugs for inflammation and immunological
disorders, but its collaborations with other companies extends its
reach into other therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular
disease, CNS disorders, endocrine and metabolic diseases, and
cancer.

The company's president and CEO is Dr. Jeremy Levin, who is both a
Ph.D. and an M.D.  Levin previously was vice president of corporate
development at Integrated Genetics (now part of Genzyme) and before
that, was the founder of Odyssey Biomedical.

The technological focus of Cadus lies in signal-transduction
pathways and their use as screening tools for the discovery of
compounds that may serve as drugs. A signal-transduction pathway
is the mechanism by which cells respond to messenger chemicals from
the "outside world." Messenger chemicals such as hormones and
growth factors impinge on the outer surface of cells, landing on
receptor substances that accomodate the size, shape, and chemical
binding ability of the messengers.

This binding of messenger chemical to cell receptor ultimately
triggers an action by the cell, perhaps to commence multiplying,
perhaps to commence secreting a substance.  The mechanism by which
the initial messenger-receptor interaction is transmitted as
information to the innards of the cell is what is meant by the
signal-transduction pathway.  It is a relay system, in which
peptides at the inner surface may join up to form larger, and
biologically active proteins; in which phosphorylating enzymes
become activated and commence to phosphorylate and thereby activate
the next enzyme in the series; and in which other subtle molecular
and biochemical events proceed.

One of the most common types of signal-transduction pathways is the
G-protein coupled type; more than 1,000 such receptors having been
identified to date. G-protein receptors, for instance, underlie the
actions of such hormones as adrenaline, angiotensin, glucagon,
luteinizing hormone, and vasopressin, and such neurotransmitters as
acetylcholine, enkephalin, and endorphin.

Such receptors also mediate odorants in the neuroepithelial cells
of the nose and light striking  the rod and cone cells comprising
the retina of the eye. They apparently play a role in Alzheimer's
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and
some cancers.

Binding of the initial messenger to the receptor causes a change in
the structure of the G protein, which in turn has the effect of
activating an associated enzyme, such as adenylyl cyclase, cyclic
guanosine monophosphate cyclase orphospholipase C.  The action of
the enzyme generates a second messenger substance, this time
operating inside the cell, that through one or more steps results
in the cell's ultimate behavior.

Cadus's key accomplishment is the construction of intact human G-
protein signal transduction material in yeast through genetic
engineering. These yeast constructs are usable as screening tools
to identify compounds that affect the biological activity of a
specific target within the signaling pathway. Another of the firm's
platform technologies looks at compounds interacting with other
signal transduction targets, such as tyrosine/MAP/MEK kinases,
multisubunit immune recognition receptors and G-protein coupled
receptors.

An offshoot that Cadus has developed is yeast-screening technology
capable of identifying functional ligands for orphan receptors.  So
far, only about 10% of the human receptors have known functions.
The other 90% are orphans -- nobody knowns what they do. Cadus has
constructed genetically engineered yeast cells expressing orphan
receptors, which and can be used as screening tools.

Among many challenge peptides inserted into the yeast, binding of
the right one to the orphan receptor will allow the yeast  cell to
grow.  This agonistic peptide can then be recovered and identified
for further studies. One critical look is to see what effect this
peptide has on human cells, and thereby to ascertain whether the
associated orphan receptor merits attention for drug-development
efforts.

Bristol-Myers Squibb endorses Cadus's work through its continuing
financial support.  BMS provided its initial support in July 1994
and added an additional $5 million equity investment in November
1995.  Ultimately, Cadus could receive more than $45 million from
BMS under all the terms of the agreement. Solvay Duphar (Brussels,
Belgium) is another supporter, one that in November 1995 gave Cadus
$10 million in a deal ultimately worth perhaps up to $50 million.

The latest news is that Cadus has obtained a patent (U.S. No.
5,482,835) protecting its yeast-based, human signal-transduction
screening technology for drug discovery.

Apparently, people are beginning to realize that the Human Genome
Project tells only part of the story.  Within the next five to 10
years, all the human genes will have been identified and sequenced.
But so what? It will still be necessary to identify the roles
played by the genes and to ascertain all the interplays among the
genes' proteins. That is what Cadus claims to have a jump on.

CELL THERAPEUTICS REPORTS NOVEL THERAPY
FOR ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

Researchers at Seattle-based Cell Therapeutics, Inc. have
reported the results of a double-blinded pilot study of
lisofylline, showing the drug may be effective in treating
patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS,
and multiple organ failure associated with systemic
infections. ARDS is a condition that affects nearly 350,000
Americans and is responsible for 170,000 deaths each year.

The scientists also presented data showing they were able to
predict patients at risk for the illness and that the
predictive value correlated with its severity.

ARDS is untreatable and represents the largest cause of
morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple traumatic
injuries. The condition is a form of lung damage often found
in patients whose lungs are injured by the systemic
inflammatory response following traumatic injury, severe blood
infections such as sepsis, or other systemic illness. Another
subset of patients at extreme risk for ARDS includes cancer
patients receiving high-dose radiation therapy or
chemotherapy.

"Based on the results of our pilot studies and the breadth of
our pre-clinical data, lisofylline may increase the efficacy
and reduce the cost of trauma care by significantly shortening
the length of hospital stay and recuperation time," said
James A. Bianco, M.D., president and chief executive officer
of Cell Therapeutics, Inc.

The company's researchers have previously reported a link
between the production of phosphatidic acid (PA) and the
oxidative damage to lung and other organs seen in ARDS. PA is
a fat-like chemical messenger generated by the cell membrane
in response to cell injury caused by a form of highly reactive
oxygen. They hypothesized that since lisofylline inhibits PA
formation, the small-molecule drug would decrease cell
susceptibility to oxidative damage and reduce the lung leak
observed in ARDS patients.

In a pilot study, Stuart L. Bursten, M.D., Ph.D., principal
scientist at Cell Therapeutics, Inc., and co-workers measured
the ratio of certain free fatty acids (FFA) - chemical
by-products of PA metabolism - found in the blood. They found
that the increase in the ratio of the fatty acids predicted
which patients would develop the syndrome and that the
predictive value correlated with the severity of the illness.

FFA levels in serum of 39 healthy control subjects were
measured and retrospectively compared to the FFA serum levels
in 30 patients who had developed sepsis, trauma or ARDS within
24 hours of serum sampling. Of these 30 patients, 13 were at
risk for ARDS but did not develop the syndrome, seven patients
at risk for ARDS did develop the condition, and 10 patients
had ARDS on admission to the study.

The serum samples from all 30 ARDS patients had significantly
elevated ratios of specific serum FFA (i.e., oleate plus
lineolate : palmitate) compared to healthy control subjects
(p < 0.01).

The researchers then conducted a 13-patient, randomized
placebo-controlled pilot study of lisofylline in patients with
life-threatening infections and multiple organ failure who
were at risk for ARDS. None of the six patients who received
lisofylline died, while three out of seven patients in
the non-treatment group did. In addition, the FFA (acyl chain)
ratio for the lisofylline-treated patients was significantly
lower than the placebo control group (1.21 and 1.46
respectively, p = 0.02).

"We found that the calculated ratios of serum free-fatty
acids increased and predicted the development of ARDS in these
at-risk patients," said Dr. Bursten. "The data points to the
acyl chain ratio as being of clinical utility in predicting
ARDS and may be a valuable tool in monitoring treatment."

Lisofylline is in final stages of Phase II clinical testing
of its ability to accelerate blood-cell recovery following
oxidative stress and the cell-membrane damage that occurs from
radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Clinical results have
shown that chemotherapy-treated patients undergoing bone-
marrow transplantation and treated with lisofylline experience
a rapid recovery of white blood cells, red blood cells and
platelets.

The novel therapeutic also has been shown to protect other
tissues and major organs from the otherwise toxic effects of a
number of anticancer agents, including interleukin-2 (IL-2).
Cell Therapeutics is in discussions with several potential
corporate partners to conduct Phase Ill clinical trials of
lisofylline for ARDS following multiple trauma.

Cell Therapeutics; Inc., is a privately held, Seattle-based
pharmaceutical company developing a new class of drugs that
selectively regulate the metabolism of phosphatidic acid, an
abnormal intracellular pathway expressed in cancer, immune
diseases and other life-threatening conditions.

MICROCIDE AND DAIICHI FORM PARTNERSHIP
TO SOLVE PROBLEM IN ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE

Microcide Pharmaceuticals, Inc., of Mountain View, CA, and
Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.  have signed a joint research
agreement to discover and develop drugs that will overcome the
efflux pump (drug export) mechanism of resistance used by
Pseudomonas and other bacteria to thwart the effectiveness of
current antibiotic therapies.

Under the three-year agreement, Daiichi will receive
worldwide rights to products emerging from the research
effort. Initial products of the partnership are expected to be
antibiotic-potentiating agents, which would be used together
with existing antibiotics. The potentiating agents would
interfere with the bacterial drug export system, thereby
increasing drug concentrations within the bacterium to levels
sufficient to kill otherwise-resistant organisms. The
collaboration may also produce agents which are themselves
antibiotics, acting directly to kill bacteria through
inhibition of the efflux mechanism.

Microcide will receive research funding of $10 million over 3
years and multiple milestone payments for products developed
under the agreement. Microcide will also receive royalties on
worldwide sales and has retained co-promotion rights in North
America for products developed by the partners.

Jim Rurka, president and chief executive officer of
Microcide, said, "Daiichi has a formidable research,
development and commercialization track record in the
infectious disease sector, especially with regard to leading
quinolone agents. They are the ideal partner for this
Microcide technology, because they have acquired unparalleled
expertise on the antibiotic side of the bacterial efflux
resistance equation."

The companies will each contribute research personnel and
complementary technologies to the discovery and development
program, with work-plan activities being conducted in both
Mountain View and Tokyo. A joint research committee will
manage the collaboration.

The efflux pump mechanism has been identified as an important
factor in the growing problem of bacterial drug resistance.
Described as energy-driven and membrane- associated, it works
by pumping antibiotics, including quinolones, out of a
bacterial cell, reducing the concentration of drug at the
target site of action. Quinolones are anti-infective compounds
that inhibit the activity of DNA gyrase, an enzyme necessary
for bacterial growth. Most fluoroquinolones are readily
absorbed, making them effective treatments for systemic
infections. The worldwide market for quinolones totals
approximately $2.5 billion.

This collaboration marks the second significant transaction
concluded between Microcide and a major pharmaceutical company
in the past month. On October 25, Microcide announced its
first corporate partnership in the form of a multi-year
collaborative agreement with Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals, a
division of Johnson & Johnson, to develop therapeutic
compounds for Grain-positive bacterial infections.
Microcide's corporate strategy calls for similar arrangements
in the future in order to accelerate development of its novel
antibiotic discoveries, and to provide a strong financial
support base for the company.

Microcide Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a privately held
biopharmaceutical company founded to address the emerging
market by increasing prevalence of bacterial resistance,
growth of at-risk populations and decreased research efforts
in this arena. The company is focusing on the host-pathogen
relationship and has taken a genetic approach in its
technology designed to generate novel product leads. Its
initial chemistry driven efforts are aimed at discovery and
development of new antibiotics for institutionally-acquired
bacterial infections or infections where currently available
treatments are ineffective or inadequate.

Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. is a major Japanese ethical
drugs maker. The company markets drugs to all bacterial
infections, hepatitis, cancer, thrombosis,
hypercholesterolemia and ulcers, and contrast medium.
Development efforts center around quinolones, anti-clotting
agents, cardiovascular drugs and imaging contrast agents. The
company's sales for fiscal 1994 exceeded $2 billion.

CORTECS REPORTS POSITIVE PRELIMINARY RESULTS
FOR "PSEUDOSAT" ORAL VACCINE AGAINST PSEUDOMONAS

Cortecs International (NASDAQ:DLVRY/ LSE:COR.UASX:CRI), of
London, England, has announced the preliminary results of its
Phase I/II study in bronchiectasis of Pseudostate, its oral
vaccine against pseudomonas infection of the lung, which the
company commenced in March 1995. Analysis of the total results
is continuing and there should be more to report early in
1996.

The preliminary analysis shows that, after oral vaccination,
these patents exhibited a specific immune response through a
type of white blood cell called "T" cells, which enables these
cells to seek out and destroy the invading bacteria.

Also in this study, there was observed a several-fold
reduction in white cell content of the sputum (white cells in
sputum reflect the severity of infection, "pus" in sputum
predominantly consists of dead white cells).  Oral Pseudostat
was given at intervals during 56 days and a progressive
improvement in responses was observed. Within 28 days of
discontinuing treatment the white cells in sputum were rising
again.

This open phase I/II study was carried out in Newcastle, NSW,
Australia at Cortecs' Australian Institute for Mucosal
Immunology, (AIMI) in 10 patients with bronchiectasis (a
disease of the lungs in which the structure of the bronchi,
the tubes lining the lungs, is distorted so that bronchial
secretions cannot easily be expelled and then become infected
and very difficult to treat.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the organism responsible for 90% of
the deaths in cystic fibrosis patients who usually become
colonized in early childhood. Antibiotics become less
effective as lung damage progresses and there are currently no
vaccines available. These results indicate the viability of an
oral vaccine for the prevention of respiratory infection with
pseudomonas in patients with serious respiratory diseases
such as cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis and
bronchiectasis.

This oral vaccine is being developed for the management of
these diseases and Phase 11 trials in both cystic fibrosis and
chronic bronchitis are scheduled to begin in 1996.

BIOTECHNOLOGY PARTNERS WITH HMO'S TO BOOST BOTTOM LINE

Biotechnology companies are increasingly teaming up with
managed care organizations to help them finance growth,
leverage technology, and market products, according to a KPMG
Peat Marwick industry guide book, "Blueprint for Growth:
Building the Biotechnology Business."

Industry restructuring, including new alliances between
biotech and managed care companies, is a key finding in the
83-page KPMG industry guide book, which creates a profile of a
complex industry in the process of self renewal. Based on
survey data collected from 374 biotech executives, the guide
book provides a prescription for industry growth. For copies
of the KPMG report, contact Anna Le Goff, KPMG national life
sciences at (800)330-KPMG or via FAX at (609)896-2968.

According to the guide book, managed care providers will
account for 90 percent of the prescription drug customers in
the United States by the turn of the century. Although this
linkage between biotech companies and managed care
organizations has yet to be fully embraced by the industry,
some progressive biotechs have joined forces with HMO's.

Collaborations make sense for both parties, according to
Robert S. Esposito, national director of biotechnology and
life sciences for KPMG Peat Marwick's Health Care & Life
Sciences Practice. Biotechnology companies are affected by
the health care environment emphasis on providing care more
efficiently and more cost-effectively; an emphasis that is
even morepronouncedinthemanagedcarearea.

Biotechnology companies can fulfill that joint requirement by
developing a product that can, for example, eliminate a
costly procedure or reduce a hospital stay due to its
efficacy. The challenge is for those companies to build
efficiencies into their product development process that will
help reduce the burden of their R&D costs on the bottom line.

HMO's and other health care payers have access to billions of
investment dollars; biotech companies need partners to fund
drug development programs. "HMO's combined have in excess $35
billion in reserves available for investment," Esposito says,
"which is more money in the aggregate than the major
pharmaceutical companies," he points out. Pharmaceutical
companies have historically provided biotech inns with an
important source of equity and revenue streams. Some 61
percent of the biotech companies responding to a KPMG survey
have licensed technology to drug companies in exchange for
cash and a future royalty stream.

This year marked a significant turnaround in the biotech
industry, according to Esposito. "It is the first time that
revenue units (premiums) are not going to increase faster
than the rate of inflation. Clearly, biotechnology products
have to be incrementally efficacious; but they're also going
to have to be cheaper," said Esposito.

Pharmacoeconomic studies, conducted as early in the
development process as possible, will become more important in
bringing drugs to market, Esposito predicts. "If they don't
conduct these studies," Esposito cautions, "companies run the
risk of losing out to the competition on what may have been a
breakthrough therapy." Esposito adds, "Pharmaceuticals are
going to be used increasingly in a very different way. Key to
that is pharmacoeconomics. These studies will be critical for
HMO's for the next five years or so."

Pharmacoeconomic studies are developed with one overriding
objective: cost effectiveness. "Biotech companies have to make
their drugs compelling and to be ahead of the competition in
order to make a solid pharmacoeconomic argument; not just a
better drug or that it has a higher cure rate. Instead, the
company must be able to support its product by stating it will
save the system money versus some alternative drugs or no-drug
therapies."

Those companies that incorporate pharmacoeconomic studies in
preclinical trials will be positioned substantially better to
meet changing market trends, including increasing competition.
"Plus," said Esposito, "HMO's will list those drugs on their
formularies. That's a marketing reality."

The KPMG survey data report that about 64 percent of
companies in clinical trials made an effort to conduct
pharmacoeconomic studies before they launched their product.
The use of such studies is on the rise. The number of
pharmacoeconomic studies per company rose from 1.7 in 1988
to 23.7 in 1994, according to the guide book.

The publication's other findings describe an industry in
transition. They include the following:

* The emergence of a new industry structure based on customer
focus in product development. Although nearly 9 in I *
executives (89 percent) report that they are focused on
creating breakthrough therapies, a traditional business
strategy, companies realize that mastering the clinical
approval process is key to future development.

* Steady industry growth, despite recent downsizing. Between
1990 and 1993, the average number of employees at a company
rose from 62 to 99. The average amount of space occupied rose
from 30,150 square feet to 56,661 square feet.

* Recruitment and competitive compensation are the two most
challenging human resource issues. Companies are out-sourcing
functions such as money management, regulatory affairs, legal
counsel, and facility compliance to remain as lean as
possible.

* The year 1994, while one of the dimmest years for equity
financing, also saw companies focused on raising capital. Some
70 percent of survey respondents report that senior management
and business development teams are actively marketing their
technologies to investors. Moreover, the marketing process is
beginning earlier.

ENCOURAGING STUDY RESULTS REPORTED
ON PHASE 2 HEPATITIS C CLINICAL
TRIALS WITH NATURAL ALPHA INTERFERON

Interferon Sciences, Inc.  (NASDAQ-IFSC), of New Brunswick,
NJ, has announced preliminary results from two phase 2
clinical trials utilizing the Company's injectable, natural-
source, multispecies alpha interferon ("Natural Alpha
Interferon") in patients chronically infected with hepatitis
C virus. These results were presented by Dr. D. M. Simon of
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, and
Dr. S. C. Gordon of William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak,
Michigan, at the annual meeting of the American Association
for the Study of Liver Diseases. In the first of these multi-
centered, randomized, open-label dose-ranging trials, 66
patients previously untreated were studied.  The second trial
studied 63 patients who had previously been treated
unsuccessfully with recombinant alpha interferon.

The preliminary results of these phase 2 studies are
encouraging and clearly justify additional studies to further
explore and define the potential use of Natural Alpha
Interferon in treating patients with hepatitis C.

Chronic viral hepatitis is a liver infection caused by
various hepatitis viruses. The United States Centers for
Disease Control estimates that approximately 2 to 3 million

MONSANTO TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING ITS BIOTECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS

Biotechnology will be a primary source of future income for
Monsanto Company according to new corporate analysis prepared
by The Freedonia Group, Inc. (Cleveland,Ohio). Analyst Lois
Krebs remarks that half of the products under development in
1994 were agricultural or pharmaceutical products derived from
genetic engineering. In the future, genetically engineered
products are expected to comprise a much larger proportion of
sales in the Agricultural Group. Although this group accounted
for only 27 percent of the company's total sales in 1994, it
contributed the largest share of operating income and is
Monsanto's fastest-growing group. The company expects the
Agricultural Group's sales to increase 20 percent annually
for the foreseeable future. These, and strategic developments
in all of Monsanto's other product groups, are analyzed fully
in the new corporate intelligence report C68, MONSANTO
COMPANY.

Monsanto, which is the fourth-largest chemical firm in the
US, manufactures agricultural chemicals, genetically
engineered plants, fibers, plastics, performance chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, artificial sweeteners and food additives. The
report looks at the Company's strategy to remain a market
leader in many of its present businesses through studied
acquisitions and divestitures. One such move discussed in the
study is the February 1995 acquisition of food additives
producer Kelco from Merck & Company, which complements many
other Monsanto business lines, particularly biotechnology for
applications in agricultural, pharmaceutical, performance
chemical and food additive products.

The complete 170-page study C68, MONSANTO COMPANY is
available for $1200.00 from The Freedonia Group, Inc., 3570
Warrensville Center Rd., Ste. 201, Cleveland, Ohio
44122-5226. For further details,  call (216)921-6800 or fax at
(216)921-5459. Full text is also available online; contact

THERMOSAFE PROTECTS ENZYMES AND REAGENTS

Polyfoam Packers Corporation has introduced an economical and
efficient benchtop system as an alternative to ice buckets for
keeping reagents and enzymes cool at the workstation. The
system, which has undergone extensive testing, provides the
largest cold bank and best insulation of any unit on the
market and is capable of holding product below 0 degree C
(32 degrees F) for over 13 hours, or below -12 degrees C
(10 degrees F) for 8 hours.

Priced at a fraction of the cost of competitive chillers, the
system consists of a two-piece expanded polystyrene foam
chest with removable microcentrifuge tube rack plus two
interchangeable sets of refrigerants.

The foam unit features high density, damage-resistant 1114,,
thick walls and as an added benefit, will safeguard reagents
against temperature fluctuations and power outages when stored
in the freezer. The removable lid incorporates an interlocking
design to stay securely in place, finger relief grips on top
for easy removal, and a contoured edge for convenient
stacking.

Microcentrifuge tube rack accommodates 15 .5 ml and 15 1.5 ml
tubes simultaneously and features an alphanumeric-grid
pattern for easy identification of vial samples.

The superior efficiency of the benchtop system is enhanced by
two sets of specially formulated gel packs. since only one gel
pack in each temperature range is necessary for operation of
the system, the alternates can be kept in the freezer ready
to use. There's no need to halt work due to a deteriorating
cold source as occurs with other systems. Because the gel pack
is removable, the entire unit does not require chilling, which
saves freezer space.

For more information or test results on the benchtop system,
contact Polyfoam Packers Corporation 2320 Foster Ave.,
Wheeling, Illinois 60090; (800)323-7442.

NIKON AND TECHNICAL INSTRUMENT COMPANY INTRODUCE
AFFORDABLE NEW CONFOCAL SYSTEM FOR BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH

Nikon Corp. of Tokyo and Technical Instrument Company of San
Jose, California, have jointly announced a new type of
microscope system designed to meet the imaging needs of
biomedical researchers. Developed by Technical instrument
Company, the PCM 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope
system is being marketed exclusively by Nikon throughout the
world.

Scientists who can benefit from confocal capability in their
work include researchers who study a wide range of diseases
such as cancer, AIDS, and Alzheimers Disease, as well as those
in fields such as neuroscience, genetics and gene mapping,
cell biology, anatomy, and more. The new high-performance
system, which has been in development for two years, Provides
users with affordable confocal imaging, an extremely advanced
method of viewing living specimens. It can discriminate
between individual layers of tissue that are less than 1/100
the width of a human hair apart in depth, at a rate of one
full-frame image per second.

The PCM 2000, which is designed to be used without extensive
training, creates a personal confocal workstation at a highly
competitive price. Previous confocal instruments have been
several times more costly than the current systems, making
it necessary for groups of scientists to share a single unit.

"We believe that the PCM 2000 is a vital contributor to next-
generation imaging for life science researchers," said Gerald
F. Benham, manager of biomedical confocal systems for Nikon
Inc. "It offers individual users unprecedented access to
advanced optical imaging at an extraordinary price-performance
ratio, and becomes a complement to our already strong line of
high-level b confocal systems."

"Two well-respected companies have combined our talents to
offer the brightest intracellular confocal imaging system on
the market, and we look forward to working closely with hers
the world over," said Francis Lundy, president of Technical
Instrument Company.

Nikon Inc. is the U.S. distributor of world-renowned Nikon
Corp. biomedical, industrial, ophthalmic and surveying
instruments, Nikon 35mm cameras, speedlights and accessories,
Nikkor lenses, Nikonos underwater photographic systems, Nikon
eyewear, Nikon sports and recreational optics, and electronic
imaging products.

Founded in 1950, Technical Instrument Company is the leading
manufacturer of high- performance confocal microscope systems
for medical, industrial, semiconductor and pharmaceutical
applications.

SEPRAGEN RECEIVES RESIN PATENT WHICH ENHANCES CAPABILITY
FOR LARGE-SCALE CHROMATOGRAPHY PURIFICATION

Sepragen Corporation, of San Leandro, CA, has been awarded a
European patent on its Cellulosic Monolithic Resin Separations
Media, a specialized media for chromatographic separations
that is capable of high throughput in particulate-laden
streams.  Vinit Saxena, Sepragen president and chairman, said
the new resin overcomes clogging and other problems
experienced with traditional separations media which needs to
be pretreated to remove debris and aggregates.

"Sepragen's new media solves this problem and allows
extremely rapid purification of dirty protein solutions at a
fraction of the cost of traditional methods," Saxena said.
"Most media are beads, which are packed into a column and can
clog easily. Our material is made out of a special foam-like
material which has large channels that allow particles to go
through and small pores for sites for the molecules that need
to be bound. No beaded media have this kind of unique pore
structure."

"This new media fits perfectly into our strategy to develop
and market complete systems for large-scale purification and
processing."

Sepragen acquired this technology in 1994 through an asset
purchase of BPS Separations in the United Kingdom. The company
spent the last year in additional development of the product,
and is currently field testing the resin media. The company
was granted the European patent (#0530258) on Sept. 22, 1995.
A United States patent is pending.

Saxena said the application possibilities for this resin are
numerous. In the biotechnology area this chromatography media
enables purification of biological drugs from "whole cell
broth," thereby eliminating several pre- treatment steps
resulting in higher yields, faster processing and lower
manufacturing costs. In the food and environmental areas,
where the streams are generally "dirty", this media will
enable new chromatographic separations to be performed
economically for the first time.

Sepragen has been involved in the chromatography field since
its inception in 1985, and introduced its patented Radial Flow
Chromatography (RFC) columns in 1987. These columns improve on
traditional axial flow columns, a technology some 40 years
old.

Saxena said that adding this resin to its product line moves
Sepragen closer towards its long range goal of being the
leading provider of complete solutions for large-scale
chromatographic separations.

Sepragen Corporation is a pioneer in the development of
large-scale chromatography products and technology for the
biopharmaceutical industry. Sepragen markets its patented RFC
columns, computer-controlled workstations and process
technology to the biotechnology, food and environmental
industries.

The company's products are being used by leading biotech
companies as well as by food companies to produce new
value-added products and processes. Based in San Leandro,
California, the company markets its proprietary RFC technology
and services worldwide.

RCT PATENTS REAGENTS ULTRASENSITIVE DETECTION OF AMINES

U.S. Patent No. 5,459,272 has been issued to Research
Corporation Technologies (RCT) for reagents that permit
ultrasensitive detection of amines. RCT exclusively licensed
the reagents to Molecular Probes, Inc. in Engene, Oregon in
1991 on behalf of Indiana University and the inventors. Dr.
Milos Novotny and associates.

Molecular Probes incorporated the technology in its ATTO-TAG
reagent kits for amine detection, including amino groups in
peptides and glycoproteins. Although nonfluorescent
themselves, they induce fluorescence in amine reaction
products at wavelengths beyond those of background substances.
These characteristics allow ALLO-TAG reagents to minimize
background interference and greatly increase sensitivity in
amine analyses compared to conventional reagents such as o-
phthaldialdehyde (OPA) and fluorescamine.

The reagents enable ultrasensitive fluorescence techniques to
be applied to a wide range of important compounds such as
peptides, amino acids and even carbohydrates. While ATTO-TAG
reagents can be used with absorption detection methods, their
superior fluorescence properties permit unparalleled
sensitivity and detection limits in liquid chromatography and
capillary electrophoresis.

Highly sensitive determinations of amino acids and peptides
are among the most important analyses required in research,
diagnostic and forensic applications for biochemistry,
agrochemistry and pharmaceuticals.

In addition to the fluorogenic reagent, ATTO-TAG kits include
samples of potassium cyanide and a protocol for amine
modification. Each kit can derivatize 100-200 samples,
depending on amine concentration and sample volume. Kits are
priced at $98 or $78.40 per kit in quantities of five. The
ATTO-TAG reagent is also available separately at S110 for 10
mg.

To place an order, contact Molecular Probes at (503)465-8300,
fax (800)438-0228.

For further information, call the Technical Assistance
Department at (503) 465-8353.  Molecular Probes, a private
biotechnology company, produces organic dyes, pigments an
d chemicals and provides custom synthesis, consulting and
contract research services.

SEPRAGEN REPORTS LOSS FOR THIRD QUARTER

Sepragen Corporation (NASDAQ: SPGNU, SPGNA, SPGNW, SPGNZ), of
San Leandro, CA, which develops and manufactures
chromatography columns and computer-controlled process systems
for the biotech and other industries, has reported results for
the quarter ended September 30, 1995.

Net sales for the 1995 quarter were $90,711, down from
$882,295 in the same period in 1994. The net loss for the
quarter ended September 30, 1995, was $873,319, or (0.31)
cents a share, compared with a loss of $45,846, or (0.06)
cents a share, for the 1994 quarter, based on a weighted
average number of shares outstanding of 2,855,032 and 735,528,
respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, net sales were
$888,643, down 45 percent from $1,607,050 for the same period
in 1994. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30
was $1,873,131, or (0.87) cents a share, compared with a loss
of $370,619 or (0.50) for the same period in 1994, based on a
weighted average number of shares outstanding of 2,141,595
and 735,528, respectively.

Vinit Saxena, president and chief executive officer, said the
higher 1994 sales figures reflected a large single order for
QuantaSep systems that the company shipped in the third
quarter of 1994. "We expect that revenues generated from sales
of large industrial scale Superflo columns and large QuantaSep
systems will continue to be a significant portion of our
revenue in the immediate future," Saxena said. "We have
experienced, and continue to experience, volatility in revenue
on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

Selling, general and administrative costs totaled $593,778 in
the third quarter of 1995, nearly double the amount in the
third quarter of 1994. The expenses are part of the company's
plan to increase growth through new hires, plans for a new
facility and time spent on new marketing programs and
strategic alliances. In addition, the company's research and
development expenses were $287,745 in the third quarter of
1995, more than double the amount spent in the third quarter
of 1994. The increase was attributable to expenditures
related to the development of a process for dairy whey
fractionation, the development of a special absorbent media
and further development of QuantaSep products.

Sepragen Corporation is a pioneer in the development of
large-scale chromatography products and technology for the
biopharmaceutical industry. The company markets patented
Radial Flow Chromatography (RFC) columns, computer-controlled
process chromatography workstations and process technology to
the biotechnology and food industries. Based in San Leandro,

GENETIC WORKSTATION INTRODUCED BY VYSIS

Integrating various applications of cytogenetics and
karyotyping just became easier with the introduction of the
QUIPS Genetic Workstation from Vysis Inc., of Downers Grove,
IL. For research use in karyotyping, chromosomal evaluation,
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses, the new integrated
system comprises a multitude of tools and optimized reagents
designed to easily capture, enhance, analyze and print high-
quality images.

The QUIPS Genetic Workstation allows researchers to visualize
fluorescent signals under a high-powered fluorescence
microscope. With a simple point and click, the user can
capture and resolve even closely spaced probe signals. The
system combines a high-performance, digital charged-couple
device (CCD) camera with powerful imaging software to permit
acquisition and analysis of even the weakest signals.
Resolution of the Photometrics CCD camera approaches the
theoretical maximum for light.

QUIPS configurations and tools include QUIPS-FISH, QUIPS-CGH,
QUIPS-AKS, and QUIPS-ACES.

The QUIPS-FISH system utilizes scientific grade CCD cameras
for unsurpassed spatial resolution and sensitivity with a wide
range of FISH probes and reagents. The system is equipped with
a complete set of filters and automation for most FISH imaging
needs, including Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH).
Featuring flexible text and graphic layout, QUIPS-FISH offers
accurate, high-resolution printing using dye sublimation
printers for a result that nears photographic quality.

Vysis offers a wide range of FISH probes and reagents
optimized for use with QUIPS-FISH instrumentation and filters.
Vysis CEP Chromosome Enumerator Probes, WCP Whole Chromosome
Paints, and LSI Loci-Specific Identifiers are powerful tools
for enumerating chromosomes in interphase or metaphase
preparations, identifying translocations, or determining other
chromosomal anomalies.

Vysis has designed the QUIPS Comparative Genomic Hybridization
(CGH) System to capture, analyze, visualize and produce rapid
quantitative interpretation and reports of CGH results in one
integrated unit. With CGH used more frequently now as a
powerful in situ hybridization tool for whole genomic DNA
analysis, accurate amplification of the ratio profile of two
fluorescent signals has gained in importance.

The system provides statistical interpretation of the ratio
profile information for quantitative comparison with control
data. In addition, it provides results-oriented automation and
integration of DAPI-banded karyotyping in a flexible data
format. Project management capabilities using a centralized
directory and near photographic quality output complete the
QUIPS-CGH System.

The QUIPS Automated Karyotyping System (AKS) automates the
process of capturing, enhancing, classifying and printing
high-quality images of chromosomes prearranged in a variety or
user-selected karyogram formats. QUIPS-AKS replaces 35mm
photography, darkroom processing and manual cutting and
pasting of chromosomes. The system provides auto-
classification of chromosomes and karyotyping of C, R, Q and
DAPI-banded chromosomes, managed by a centralized directory
for project management. The system simplifies results
reporting and provides near photographic quality high-
resolution accurate prints.

The QUIPS Automated Chromosomal Evaluation System (ACES)
increases throughput by scanning a slide and assessing
multiple gene probes in different colors within nuclei. An
example of the QUIPS ACES is counting human chromosomes in
amniocytes for ploidy status as related to genetic diseases.
The system automatically scans slides, isolates nuclei, and
counts multiple color signals to provide an easily interpreted
statistical result. Reliable unattended operation and rapid
image-acquisition and transfer increase the efficiency of the
cytogenetics laboratory, allowing technician time for other
required tasks. Vysis has designed the QUIPS ACES for future
expansion with additional assays and multiple slide
capabilities.

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR LEADERS OPEN BALTIMORE BIOCENTER

Less than a year from the date of the BioCenter, Baltimore,
MD, ground-breaking, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Senator Paul
S. Sarbanes and other public and private sector leaders
have announced the completion of the BioCenter's construction.

The BioCenter, the 54,000 square foot biopharmaceutical
manufacturing facility for biotechnology companies, celebrated
its ribbon cutting celebration today with over 200 people from
the biotech community. The BioCenter is located on five acres
of land donated by the City of Baltimore adjacent to the
Hopkins Bayview Research Campus.

"The BioCenter facility is @ unique and provides a critical
resource necessary to move medical products out of the lab and
into the hands of patients," said Governor Parris N.
Glendening. "In order to keep Maryland-grown discoveries and
the resulting jobs at home and attract companies to Maryland,
the state made a strategic investment in the future of our
biotech companies through our support of the BioCenter."

The BioCenter was created by a landmark public/private
partnership, the Maryland Bioprocessing Center, organized
almost seven years ago by the State of Maryland.

Bio Science Chairman Jacques R. Rubin noted that the
BioCenter will begin operations in the first quarter of 1996.
The BioCenter has four GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices)
production suites, three for microbial products and one for
cell culture production. Bio Science at the BioCenter also
provides companies with in-house quality control labs,
qualified GMP-trained staff, client staff training, regulatory
documentation assitance and client adminstrative offices.
"Bio Science provides biotech companies with cost and time-
saving alternatives to bringing life-saving drugs to market,"
said Rubin.

of $5,080,000, or $0.89 per share, for the same period in
1994.

The increase in revenues in the third quarter of 1995
compared to the third quarter of 1994 resulted primarily from
research support payments received from the Pharmaceutical
Division of Kirin Brewing Company, Limited, as part of an
agreement to develop and commercialize NPS's treatment for
hyperparathyroidism, Norcalcin, in Japan and certain other
parts of Asia.

The net loss for the third quarter was greater in 1995 than
in 1994 primarily because of the progressively more expensive
clinical trials the company is conducting for Norcalcin in the
U.S.

Hunter Jackson, Ph.D., Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of NPS, commented, "Three clinical trials
for Norcalcin were in progress during the third quarter and
we expect them to be completed near the end of the year.
Negotiations are progressing with potential corporate partners
for the commercialization of Norcalcin outside of Asia. We
are hopeful that an agreement will be reached during the
fourth quarter. Such an agreement, along with ongoing research
support payments from Kirin and SmithKIine Beecham, our
partner in osteoporosis research, will further reduce our net
cash requirements and accelerate development of Norcalcin."

NPS Pharmaceuticals, a development-stage company founded in
1986 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, combines a novel
focus on ion-related drug targets with valuable drug discovery
leads from non-traditional natural product sources. The
company is currently devoting the bulk of its research and
development efforts to hyperparathyroidism, osteoporosis and
central nervous system disorders, including chronic pain and
brain damage from stroke.

SCHERING-PLOUGH BOARD ELECTS RICHARD KOGAN TO CEO
AND ROBERT P. LUCIANO CONTINUES AS CHAIRMAN OF BOARD

Richard J. Kogan, president and chief operating officer of
Schering-Plough Corporation (NYSE:SGP), has been elected
president and chief executive officer by the company's Board
of Directors, effective Jan. 1, 1996. Kogan will succeed
Robert P. Luciano, who will continue to serve as chairman of
the Board.

Kogan, 54, has served as Schering-Plough's president and COO
since 1986, and as a member of the Board of Directors since
1982. Luciano, 62, has been Schering-Plough's CEO since 1982
and chairman since 1984. He will remain as chairman of the
Board for another three years upon relinquishing his CEO title
on Jan. 1.

I am pleased that the Board has agreed with my recommendation
that Dick Kogan be elected Schering-Plough's new chief
executive officer," said Luciano. "I've known and worked with
him for nearly 30 years. He's a top-notch executive, with the
hard-driving, far-sighted capabilities needed to lead a
pharmaceutical company during these challenging times. I have
every confidence in his ability to continue Schering-Plough's
successful record."

Kogan credited Luciano with shaping a $1.8 billion (1982
sales) company, which then encompassed a range of businesses
that included radio stations, home repair products, sandals
and cosmetics, into a focused, research-driven pharmaceutical
company, with 1994 sales of $4.5 billion.

"In the nearly 14 years that Bob Luciano has led Schering-
Plough, this company has achieved a total rate of return for
shareholders unmatched in the industry," said Kogan. "He has
brought Schering-Plough to a position of strength, directing
the company's investments in biotechnology and leading-edge
sciences, guiding the renewal of its infrastructure, and
overseeing its expansion into major international markets,"
said Kogan.

Observing that the management team responsible for Schering-
Plough's achievements remains in place, Kogan said he intends
to continue the strategies that have benefited shareholders
and served as the company's blueprint for growth and
competitive success. He said the following key objectives will
stay as priorities:

0 Attracting and developing talented employees, and then
continually challenging and rewarding them;

0 Remaining committed to research and development, focusing on
innovative products that can conquer, treat or prevent life-
threatening diseases in an effective manner;

0 Exercising flexibility and speed in anticipating and
adapting quickly to market changes and the needs of customers;

9 Maintaining financial strength to provide the resources to
compete and grow, while providing attractive returns to
shareholders;

Maintaining vigilant and rigorous control over all costs; and

Upholding the highest ethical, business and compliance
standards in the conduct of the company's business worldwide.

"These have been my benchmarks since joining Schering-Plough,"
said Kogan, "and if we hold fast to them -- never taking our
eye off the ball -- we can expect to see this company continue
to grow and prosper well into the next century."

Reporting to Kogan will be Raul E. Cesan, executive vice
president and president of Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals;
Donald R. Conklin, executive vice president and president of
Schering-Plough HealthCare Products; Hugh A. D'Andrade,
executive vice president - administration; Harold R. Hiser,
Jr., executive vice president - finance; and Gordon C.
O'Brien, senior vice president - human resources.

Kogan joined Schering-Plough in April 1982 as executive vice
president - pharmaceutical operations, and was elected
president and chief operating officer on Jan. 1, 1986. Before
joining Schering-Plough, he was president of the U.S.
pharmaceuticals division of Ciba-Geigy Corporation. A native
of New York City, Kogan received his B.A. from The City
College of the City University of New York and an M.B.A. from
the Stern School of Business at New York University.

Kogan is a trustee of Atlantic Mutual Companies and a director
of the affiliated Centennial Insurance Company. He also is a
member of the boards of directors of NatWest Bancorp, General
Signal Corporation and the Saint Barnabas Medical Center,
Livingston, N.J. He is president of the International
Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations, a
member and past chairman of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, and a member of the Council on
Foreign Relations.

Schering-Plough is a research-based company engaged in the
discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing of
pharmaceutical and health care products worldwide.

SEPRAGEN CORPORATION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS

Sepragen Corporation (NASDAQ: SPGNU, SPGNA, SPGNW, SPGNZ), of
San Leandro, CA, which develops and manufactures
chromatography columns and computer-controlled process systems
for the biotech and other industries, has reported results for
the quarter ended September 30, 1995.

Net sales for the 1995 quarter were $90,711, down from
$882,295 in the same period in 1994. The net loss for the
quarter ended September 30, 1995, was $873,319, or (0.31)
cents a share, compared with a loss of $45,846, or (0.06)
cents a share, for the 1994 quarter, based on a weighted
average number of shares outstanding of 2,855,032 and 735,528,
respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, net sales were
$888,643, down 45 percent from $1,607,050 for the same period
in 1994. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30
was $1,873,131, or (0.87) cents a share, compared with a loss
of $370,619 or (0.50) for the same period in 1994, based on a
weighted average number of shares outstanding of 2,141,595
and 735,528, respectively.

Vinit Saxena, president and chief executive officer, said the
higher 1994 sales figures reflected a large single order for
QuantaSep systems that the company shipped in the third
quarter of 1994. "We expect that revenues generated from sales
of large industrial scale Superflo columns and large QuantaSep
systems will continue to be a significant portion of our
revenue in the immediate future," Saxena said. "We have
experienced, and continue to experience, volatility in revenue
on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

Selling, general and administrative costs totaled $593,778 in
the third quarter of 1995, nearly double the amount in the
third quarter of 1994. The expenses are part of the company's
plan to increase growth through new hires, plans for a new
facility and time spent on new marketing programs and
strategic alliances. In addition, the company's research and
development expenses were $287,745 in the third quarter of
1995, more than double the amount spent in the third quarter
of 1994. The increase was attributable to expenditures
related to the development of a process for dairy whey
fractionation, the development of a special absorbent media
and further development of QuantaSep products.

Sepragen Corporation is a pioneer in the development of
large-scale chromatography products and technology for the
biopharmaceutical industry. The company markets patented
Radial Flow Chromatography (RFC) columns, computer-controlled
process chromatography workstations and process technology to

HMO'S TEAM WITH BIOTECH FIRMS TO BOOST BOTTOM LINE

Biotechnology companies are increasingly teaming up with
managed care organizations to help them finance growth,
leverage technology, and market products, according to a KPMG
Peat Marwick industry guide book, "Blueprint for Growth:
Building the Biotechnology Business."

Industry restructuring, including new alliances between
biotech and managed care companies, is a key finding in the
83-page KPMG industry guide book, which creates a profile of a
complex industry in the process of self renewal. Based on
survey data collected from 374 biotech executives, the guide
book provides a prescription for industry growth. For copies
of the KPMG report, contact Anna Le Goff, KPMG national life
sciences at (800)330-KPMG or via FAX at (609)896-2968.

According to the guide book, managed care providers will
account for 90 percent of the prescription drug customers in
the United States by the turn of the century. Although this
linkage between biotech companies and managed care
organizations has yet to be fully embraced by the industry,
some progressive biotechs have joined forces with HMO's.

Collaborations make sense for both parties, according to
Robert S. Esposito, national director of biotechnology and
life sciences for KPMG Peat Marwick's Health Care & Life
Sciences Practice. Biotechnology companies are affected by
the health care environment emphasis on providing care more
efficiently and more cost-effectively; an emphasis that is
even morepronouncedinthemanagedcarearea.

Biotechnology companies can fulfill that joint requirement by
developing a product that can, for example, eliminate a
costly procedure or reduce a hospital stay due to its
efficacy. The challenge is for those companies to build
efficiencies into their product development process that will
help reduce the burden of their R&D costs on the bottom line.

HMO's and other health care payers have access to billions of
investment dollars; biotech companies need partners to fund
drug development programs. "HMO's combined have in excess $35
billion in reserves available for investment," Esposito says,
"which is more money in the aggregate than the major
pharmaceutical companies," he points out. Pharmaceutical
companies have historically provided biotech inns with an
important source of equity and revenue streams. Some 61
percent of the biotech companies responding to a KPMG survey
have licensed technology to drug companies in exchange for
cash and a future royalty stream.

This year marked a significant turnaround in the biotech
industry, according to Esposito. "It is the first time that
revenue units (premiums) are not going to increase faster
than the rate of inflation. Clearly, biotechnology products
have to be incrementally efficacious; but they're also going
to have to be cheaper," said Esposito.

Pharmacoeconomic studies, conducted as early in the
development process as possible, will become more important in
bringing drugs to market, Esposito predicts. "If they don't
conduct these studies," Esposito cautions, "companies run the
risk of losing out to the competition on what may have been a
breakthrough therapy." Esposito adds, "Pharmaceuticals are
going to be used increasingly in a very different way. Key to
that is pharmacoeconomics. These studies will be critical for
HMO's for the next five years or so."

Pharmacoeconomic studies are developed with one overriding
objective: cost effectiveness. "Biotech companies have to make
their drugs compelling and to be ahead of the competition in
order to make a solid pharmacoeconomic argument; not just a
better drug or that it has a higher cure rate. Instead, the
company must be able to support its product by stating it will
save the system money versus some alternative drugs or no-drug
therapies."

Those companies that incorporate pharmacoeconomic studies in
preclinical trials will be positioned substantially better to
meet changing market trends, including increasing competition.
"Plus," said Esposito, "HMO's will list those drugs on their
formularies. That's a marketing reality."

The KPMG survey data report that about 64 percent of
companies in clinical trials made an effort to conduct
pharmacoeconomic studies before they launched their product.
The use of such studies is on the rise. The number of
pharmacoeconomic studies per company rose from 1.7 in 1988
to 23.7 in 1994, according to the guide book.

The publication's other findings describe an industry in
transition. They include the following:

* The emergence of a new industry structure based on customer
focus in product development. Although nearly 9 in I *
executives (89 percent) report that they are focused on
creating breakthrough therapies, a traditional business
strategy, companies realize that mastering the clinical
approval process is key to future development.

* Steady industry growth, despite recent downsizing. Between
1990 and 1993, the average number of employees at a company
rose from 62 to 99. The average amount of space occupied rose
from 30,150 square feet to 56,661 square feet.

* Recruitment and competitive compensation are the two most
challenging human resource issues. Companies are out-sourcing
functions such as money management, regulatory affairs, legal
counsel, and facility compliance to remain as lean as
possible.

* The year 1994, while one of the dimmest years for equity
financing, also saw companies focused on raising capital. Some
70 percent of survey respondents report that senior management
and business development teams are actively marketing their
technologies to investors. Moreover, the marketing process is
beginning earlier.

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP is the U.S. practice of KPMG, the
Global Leader among professional services firms.

Worldwide, KPMG has more than 6,000 partners as well as
67,000 professionals serving clients in more than 134
countries. In the United States, KPMG delivers a wide range
of value-added assurance, tax, international and performance
improvement services. KPMG serves biotechnology and life
sciences companies at all stages of development. As part of

ORPHAN DRUG LEGISLATION PLANNED FOR EUROPE

STRASBOURG - An orphan drug directive is part of the 1996 legislative
programme which was presented by the European Commission to the
European Parliament in Strasbourg.

Europe is the only major developed market in which there is currently
no governmental encouragement for the development of drugs for rare
diseases.

The US Orphan Drug Act, and its accompanying tax credit of 50 per cent
on research costs for orphan drug development, ended in 1994. In the
previous 10 years, however, more than 100 orphan drugs had been
launched on the US market and almost all orphan drugs available
worldwide have originated in the US.

In Japan, similar legislation has been in effect since 1993 with 29
drugs granted protected orphan drug status to date. Of these, five have
been genetically engineered.

A Task Force on Vaccines and Viral Diseases was launched last year by
European Commissioners for research and for industry, Edith Cresson and
Martin Bangemann (BBN No 113, 1 November 1995, page 7). The Task Force
has consulted with around 80 potential industrial partners, large
industrial organisations and the scientific community, identifying the
need for new vaccines for diseases such as Aids, hepatitis,
tuberculosis and malaria. Clearly such products should fall within the
scope of the proposed Orphan Drug Directive.

Little encouragement to date

Up to the present, there has been little in European legislation to
encourage the development of orphan drugs. Vaccine companies like
Pasteur-Merieux, SmithKline Beecham and Evans Medical will rightly
invest in developments with the best profit outlook.

Certainly there are existing Directives 75/318 and 91/507 which make
possible market authorisations under special circumstances for drugs
where full research information is not yet available, where there may
be ethical problems or because of the rarity of the disease. In
addition, Directive 93/41, which relates to high-technology drugs, has
similar limitations and provides a 10-year period of exclusivity even
in the absence of patent coverage.

None of these, however, provide any financial incentive to encourage
pharmaceutical companies to allocate research and development funds to
relatively small market sectors.

European pharmaceutical organisations are in favour of the idea of
legislation similar to the US Orphan Drug Act providing that it
genuinely provides the necessary stimulus. In the US, the absence of
competition for orphan drugs and the lack of established official
prices have encouraged companies such as Amgen (erythropoietin),
Genentech and Lilly (growth hormone) and the then Wellcome (AZT), to
enter profitably into this restricted sector.

Existing European Union legislation through Directives 75/318, 91/507
and 93/41, lays down the groundwork; European pharmaceutical companies
are now looking to a European Orphan Drug Law to provide the necessary
fillip.

GERMANY LOBBIES EU ON NOVEL FOOD

FRANKFURT - The German consumer watchdog Verbraucherzentrale Hessen
(VZH) and the Hesse ministry of social security have initiated a joint
campaign urging changes to the European Union's Novel Food Directive.

The campaign is aimed at members of the European Parliament who are
requested to support the labelling of all genetically engineered
foodstuffs in the forthcoming consultations on the Directive.

The campaign organisers plan to distribute 30,000 postcards which
citizens will be asked to sign and forward to members of the European
Parliament. In cooperation with the ministry, the consumer organisation
has also targeted 300 MEPs who had "demonstrated inconsistent behaviour
in previous votes on genetic engineering", said Hartmut Koenig of the
VZH.

The Novel Food Directive, which was approved by the EU Council of
Ministers in October 1995, was inadequate, added Mr Koenig, because it
did not take into account consumer demands for a high level of safety
and transparency for genetically engineered food.

Through the campaign, the ministry and the consumer watchdog want to
lobby for the "necessary corrections to be made by the European
Parliament". They demand a broader scope of application of the
declaration which would include all foodstuffs produced using genetic
engineering and also additives and auxiliary substances such as
enzymes.

"The most serious disregard of consumers' interests has taken place on
the issue of novel food labelling", Mr Koenig said. The position of the
Council of Ministers was too vague as it only demanded the declaration
of food which differs significantly from the conventional product. This
term was not being defined precisely enough, he argued.

Barbara Stolterfoht, the Hesse Minister of Social Security, criticised
the German Health Minister, Horst Seehofer: "Unfortunately Minister
Seehofer could not even push through the comprehensive labelling of
novel food within the Council of Ministers. Consumers therefore need to
lobby the members of the European Parliament directly."

The European Parliament is expected to reach a decision on the Novel
Food Directive in March.

HAMBURG SETS UP GENETIC TESTING LAB

HAMBURG - Hamburg in Germany has established a municipal laboratory for
the supervision of genetic engineering experiments.

Following the lead taken by Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg and Berlin,
Hamburg becomes the fourth state to open a laboratory of this kind. It
is the first, however, which is suitable to supervise experiments up to
the second highest security level (S3), according to the Hamburg
authorities.

"The new laboratory allows us to check whether researchers are actually
working with the genetically altered organisms they were given
permission for", said Fritz Vahrenholt, Hamburg's senator for the
environment.

BIOTECH PATENTING IN THE  DEVELOPING WORLD

MUNICH - The property rights to biotechnology discoveries made by
pharmaceutical multinationals in developing countries need to be
established and improved.

Pharmaceutical companies which develop new plant and animal varieties,
drugs or chemicals based on genetic resources should share their
profits with the owners of the resources on a mutually agreed basis,
according to Professor Joseph Straus of the Max-Planck-Institute for
international patent, proprietary and competition law in Munich.

To illustrate the argument, Prof Straus points to the first public
agreement between a developing country and a pharmaceuticals company.
It was concluded in 1991 between Merck and the Costa Rican biodiversity
research organisation, INBio. The arrangement involves the cataloguing
of plants and animals in Costa Rica, carried out by INBio, and Merck's
right to screen this inventory for marketable products. The company
made a downpayment of $1 million for this right and will pay further
royalties if it discovers a product.

The international commitment to take part in such agreements is
increasing, Mr Straus believes, following the setting up in 1993 of the
US International Cooperative Biodiversity Group (ICBG) to promote more
such partnerships.

He outlines this view in an article entitled "Biotechnology and
Intellectual Property", published in Legal, Economic and Social
Dimensions of Modern Biotechnology, a new volume in a comprehensive
series on the subject which has now been completely revised. It
addresses readers working in industry, at universities or public
institutions.

Apart from the aspects of patent rights, this latest volume looks at
product development and legal requirements, biotech in a developing
world and public attitudes and political responses towards biotech.

ISRAEL BACKS SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION

JERUSALEM - Scientific collaboration in the Middle East is being
actively pursued as the political climate thaws.

At the end of 1995, UNESCO, together with the Hebrew University,
inaugurated a joint international school for molecular and
microbiology.

Based at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the purpose of the school
is to further cooperation between scientists and universities in the
Middle East, develop programmes for the training of lecturers and
researchers, and establish links between scientists working in
molecular biology, medicine, biotechnology and microbiology worldwide.

In the long run, it is hoped that the school will help to enhance the
state of health of mankind, the provision of food for both humans and
animals, and protect the environment.

At the opening seminar, the lecturers discussed different biotech
activities, joint projects already ongoing between Israel and
Palestine, and the concept of science crossing national borders.

Over the course of three days, the school held sessions given by
international scientists. This was followed by a two-day workshop,
sponsored by UNESCO and Silicon Graphics Biomedical, which included
lectures, demonstrations and hands-on tutorials about computational
analysis.

"The programme is targeted mostly at doctoral students right now",
according to Yechiel Becker, chairman of the Institute of Microbiology
at the Hebrew University, and the founder and director of the
international school. "We plan to offer theoretical and experimental
workshops, teach new techniques and foster good relationships between
researchers. Sharing knowledge and advancements in science will promote
peace by enhancing the understanding and cooperation between peoples in
the Middle East and other parts of the world."

The agreement to create the international school was originally signed
in April 1995. Its theme is "Science for Peace" and it will involve
more than 20 Israeli and Palestinian researchers. Cooperation between
Egypt and Jordan is also expected in the future.

The school will join the UNESCO Global Network for Molecular and Cell
Biology. Funding is primarily from UNESCO, with the Hebrew University
supplying the infrastructure. Other interested agencies and foundations
are welcome to pledge their support.

The curriculum for each 10-day session will focus on a major subject
such as biotech approaches to microbial agents, molecular biological
aspects of parasitic micro-organisms, and molecular immunology of
microbial infections in man and animal. In addition to lectures and
workshops, students will be able to join one of the research teams at
the Institute of Microbiology for the duration of the session. At
present, the budget allows for one or two sessions a year.

ISRAEL AND KOREA SIGN MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

JERUSALEM - A memorandum of understanding for scientific and
technological cooperation between the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
and the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology
(KRIBB) has been signed by representatives of the two institutions.

The signing took place in Jerusalem attended by Ilan Chet, Hebrew
University vice-president for research and development, and Kwang-Ho
Pyun, president of the KRIBB.

Also present was Hun-Pyo Ha, head of international cooperation and
public relations for KRIBB, Shabtay Dover, director of the Hebrew
University's Authority for Research and Development, and
representatives of the Israel Ministry of Science and the Arts.

The agreement provides for the exchange of faculty members and post-
doctoral students, short-term projects for technical training, joint
study and research activities, and the exchange of scientific and
technical information, such as books, reports and reference materials.

Both sides expressed the hope that a second Israel-Korea biotech
conference would take place in Israel this year. The first conference
was held last year in Seoul.

1995 - A GOOD YEAR FOR SINGAPORE BIOTECH

SINGAPORE - 1995 was a good year for biotechnology in Singapore, with a
total of 20 collaborative and commercial agreements signed during the
course of the year.

According to the year-end press briefing by the national Economic
Development Board, last year also saw several new investments and an
increasing number of biotech projects in the pipeline. Singapore's
biotech industry "is witnessing an era of exponential growth", surmised
the EDB.

Singapore benefits from its geographical location, which foreigners see
as strategically key in order to access the Asia-Pacific area. They can
use Singapore as a base for their research and development,
manufacturing, marketing and distribution requirements throughout the
region.

The EDB also reported on two investments by multinationals in
Singapore. Boehringer Mannheim of Germany formed a S$1.2 million
agreement with the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology for the
development of anticancers, and Rhone Merieux's Asia Pacific subsidiary
has committed to invest S$3 million in a locally based product
development centre.

GENETICALLY ENGINEERED PAW-PAWS

BRISBANE - Australian, Malaysian and Thai scientists are using genetic
engineering to develop disease-resistant paw-paws capable of combating
the papaya ringspot virus.

In recent years, the virus has devastated paw-paw crops throughout
South East Asia. In the mid-1980s, Thailand exported around $70 million
worth of paw-paws, now, however, it cannot supply the domestic market.

There is virtually no naturally occurring resistance to papaya ringspot
virus in Thai paw-paw varieties, leaving genetic engineering as the
most practical solution, according to Professor James Dale of the
Centre for Molecular Biotechnology of the Queensland University of
Technology.

Professor Dale and his team are collaborating

with the Thai Department of Agriculture and the Malaysian Agriculture
Research and Development Institute.

They have successfully developed a method of making Australian paw-paws
disease resistant by inserting papaya ringspot virus genes into the
plants. "So what we have to do is work with Thai scientists to develop
a similar process specific to Thai cultivars", commented Prof Dale.

BIOTECH TARGETS ALGAE POLLUTION

ADELAIDE - Toxic blue-green algae pollution in Australia is an annual
problem for the country's water control authorities. To address this,
the Sydney Water Board is backing  research at the Flinders University
of South Australia to develop a fluorescent marker that binds to
certain gene sequences of the blue-green algae, enabling their presence
to be quickly detected in water supplies.

The project also seeks to inhibit toxin production by blue-green algae.
Research leader Amanda Goodman commented: "If we can clone genes
involved in the toxin production pathway and from that get a handle on
how they are regulated, maybe there is something we can do at the
environmental level to make sure that even though the bacteria are
there, those particular genes are not expressed."

Rather than trying to poison the bacteria, the researchers are looking
at manipulating the environment so that it is not worth it for the
organism to switch on its toxin genes.

In other research, funded by the US Office of Naval Research, the
Flinders University team is working to combat bacteria fouling on
battleship hulls.

Bacteria thrive on immersed surfaces, creating what is known as
microbial biofilm. On the ship's hull, biofilm forms the basis of a
food chain which leads to encrustation, causing serious drag problems
for the vessel.

Previously the remedy was to coat hulls with toxic paints, but these
are now banned because of poisonous leaks. The researchers are
optimistic that their studies into the gene regulation of bacteria
which adhere to metal surfaces will lead to the design of non-toxic
coatings that will either repel bacteria or cause the biofilm to shed
regularly.

US BIOTECH ESTABLISHES UNRIVALLED POSITION

CAMBRIDGE, MA - In 1995, the US biotechnology industry established
itself as the unrivalled supplier of new products and technology to the
pharmaceutical industry. This leadership position encouraged the
investment community to add $3.48 billion to biotech cash reserves.

During the year, biotech companies formed more than 170 alliances with
pharmaceutical partners, with a total declared value exceeding $4.7
billion. Among these agreements were a number of strategic acquisitions
which covered late-stage products as well as enabling technologies such
as genomics and combinatorial chemistry, according to a 1995 review by
Feinstein Partners.

The average deal in 1995 was $28 million, 35 of which were valued at
more than $50 million. This contrasts with 66 agreements worth a total
of $3.2 billion in 1994. If, however, the 1994 transaction between
Chiron and Ciba-Geigy is excluded, the average deal size for the year
was only $17 million, with just nine alliances exceeding the $50
million mark.

$3.5 billion in public offerings

The significant flow of corporate agreements and headline-making
product successes attracted renewed financial interest in biotech.
Investors channelled nearly $3.5 billion into biotech public offerings
over the year, compared with $1.8 billion in 1994.

"The number and size of the alliances underscore the degree to which
the established pharmaceutical industry is looking towards
collaborations with biotech companies to fill their product pipeline",
said Feinstein Partners president Peter Feinstein. "The fact that
large, international pharmaceutical companies are both eager to pay
premiums for scientific discoveries and are willing to assume approval
and marketing risks gives comfort to the investment community. The
events of 1995 made it clear that biotech companies can create
tremendous shareholder value without necessarily bringing products to
market themselves."

The pattern of large agreements between the pharmaceutical and biotech
sectors is forecast to continue as a result of the downsizing of the
pharmaceutical industry which has created an increased demand for
product ideas from entrepreneurial ventures.

Notable deals

Recent transactions reflect the importance the mainstream
pharmaceutical industry assigns to the emerging technology and products
from the biotech pipeline. The Feinstein review highlights in
particular Hoechst Marion Roussel's agreements with ProScript, Ariad
Pharmaceuticals, Cell Genesys and Lynx Therapeutics, and Pfizer's
Pfizergen initiative which entailed deals in 1995 with Myco
Pharmaceuticals, Immusol, AEA Technology and Oxford Asymmetry. It also
notes several acquisitions, such as the Glaxo Wellcome/Affymax deal,
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's acquisition of the outstanding interest in
Applied Immune Sciences, and Sandoz, which strengthened its gene
therapy commitment with the purchase of Genetic Therapy.

The genomics companies - Myriad Genetics, Genome Therapeutics, Sequana
Therapeutics and Millenium Pharmaceuticals - concluded two major
agreements each during 1995, nearly all of which had reported values of
at least $50 million. Both Myriad and Sequana followed the transactions
with successful initial public offerings. A privately held
combinatorial chemistry company, ArQule, entered into three significant
alliances, a $30 million agreement with Pharmacia Biotech, a $50
million agreement with Solvay Duphar and a $35 million agreement with
Abbott.

Second-half pick-up

The bulk of the financial community investment in biotech was carried
out in the second half of 1995, on the back of favourable corporate
alliances and product progress. Key mid-year announcements included
Cephalon's successful Phase III clinical trial of Myotrophin in
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, and
AutoImmune's Phase II study of Colloral in rheumatoid arthritis.
Publicly traded biotech companies raised around $555 million in the
first six months of 1995 and $2.58 billion in the second half.

The pace of IPOs increased in the latter six months of last year. There
were a total of 29 IPOs by biotech companies in 1995, 15 of which took
place between October and December.

"Although the financial community's level of support for biotech
approached the peak year of 1991, investor interest reflected the
experience of prior years", said Mr Feinstein. "Unlike 1991, many of
the investments were in companies with products in clinical research
and with backing from corporate partners. Companies at earlier
development stages that went public in 1995 tended to have broad
enabling technologies and endorsements from multiple corporate
partners", he concluded.

1995 - A YEAR TO REMEMBER

WASHINGTON, DC - Most US citizens will remember 1995 as the year the
president and the Congress could not agree on how to balance the budget
resulting in the longest federal government shutdown in the country's
history.

However, the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) will remember
1995 as "one of the best for raising money, improving stock prices and
forging productive partnerships between biotech and big pharmaceutical
companies", according to Carl Feldbaum, president of BIO.

The biotech industry raised $3.6 billion as of 30 November 1995,
compared to $2.2 billion in 1994, the best year on record, according to
Mr Feldbaum. This does not include milestone payments made in 1995
through big pharmaceutical-biotech research and development
collaborations, which would add more than $90 million to the total. And
stock prices more than doubled over 1994 closing prices.

Partnerships, collaborations and other deals between biotech and big
pharmaceutical companies are "way up", says BIO. In the first three
quarters of 1995, some 52 new deals were made, compared with 45 mergers
and acquisitions in 1994, totalling $3 billion. M&As between the
biotech companies are also on the rise. In just the first three
quarters of 1995, there were 36 M&As between biotech companies,
compared with 41 deals for the whole of 1994.

1995 also saw some major advances for drugs and agricultural products
in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA approved four biotech
drugs: Genotropin, Pharmacia; Bio-Tropin, Biotechnology General Corp;
Norditropin, Novo Nordisk; and WinRho, Univax Biologics - three human
growth hormones and a treatment for thrombocytopenic purpura.

Two biotech-based drug delivery systems were also approved (two
liposome products), and four drugs already on the market received
approvals for additional indications (Intron A, Neupogen, Leukine and
Roferon-A).

The nine new biotech agricultural products approved in 1995 included
two corn plants, a potato plant and a cotton plant with natural pest
resistance, herbicide tolerant soybeans, three delayed ripening
tomatoes and high-laurate rapeseed, or canola oil for manufacturing.

The advances for the industry in 1995 did not stop at the company
level. Major efforts to loosen up regulatory restrictions on the
industry were realised this past year.

The highlight of the year came in December when Senator Nancy
Kassenbaum, chairperson of the Labour and Human Resources Committee,
introduced the first comprehensive bill from congressional leadership
on FDA reform, which includes several provisions endorsed by BIO (BBN
No 114, 22 November 1995, page 1).

"Our board's two-tiered strategy of developing an agenda of near-term
improvements in the existing system before promoting longer-term
fundamental changes has proven to be the right approach", explained Mr
Feldbaum. "It made BIO the `voice of reason' in a complex debate and
gave us high credibility and a high profile", he added.

The US Patent and Trademark Office removed utility guidelines that had
been interpreted as requiring human clinical trial data for granting of
a patent on a biotech invention. This was signed into law by President
Clinton in November.

The National Institutes of Health eliminated the "reasonable price"
clause from Co-operative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs)
that govern technology transfer.

On 9 November, Vice-President Al Gore and Donna Shalala, Health and
Human Services Secretary, and FDA commissioner David Kessler announced
the elimination of establishment licenses and lot release requirements
for biotech products.

BIO also instituted some major changes in 1995, including the election
of a new chairman, Henri Termeer, chairman and chief executive officer
of Genzyme, and a new vice-chairman for health, Gordon Binder, chairman
and CEO of Amgen.

GENE THERAPY - EXTRAORDINARY POTENTIAL BUT OVERSOLD

BETHESDA, MD - Scientists, researchers and the news media were
chastised for overselling and blowing out of proportion the present
state of gene transfer therapy in an advisory panel report to Harold
Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The report, published at the end of last year, was prepared by an
expert panel of scientists and academics, appointed to assess the NIH
investment in gene therapy research. Although the panel members were
unanimous in recognising that there is extraordinary potential in the
long term for gene therapy to manage and correct human disease, they
were concerned that: "Expectations of current gene therapy have been
oversold."

Mistaken perceptions

Following three meetings which included federal and industry scientists
and researchers, and after reviewing major research projects, the panel
wrote: "Over zealous representation of clinical gene therapy has
obscured the exploratory nature of the initial studies, coloured the
manner in which findings are portrayed to the scientific press and
public, and led to the widely held, but mistaken, perception that
clinical gene therapy is already highly successful." The report notes
that the current reality is that gene therapy has yet to yield
significant therapeutic benefits.

Panel members believed that it will require time to develop the science
of the field and convert advances to clinical practice. While
expectations show promise, clinical efficacy has not been definitively
shown at this time in any gene therapy protocol. The major obstacle to
successful gene therapy, the panel asserts, is to find the appropriate
vector to transfer the appropriate gene to the appropriate cell and to
maintain its transfer.

The first gene therapy occurred at the NIH five years ago, drawing the
attention of the scientific and medical communities, media and lay
circles. As of June 1995, there had been 106 clinical protocols
involving gene transfers on 597 subjects. Presently, the NIH spends
$200 million of its $11 million budget on gene therapy. It is estimated
that private industry's spending on gene therapy research exceeds that
spent by the NIH and underwrites the major proportion of approved
clinical protocols.

Panel recommendations

Based on their findings, the panel makes the following recommendations:

* Greater focus is required on the basic aspects of gene transfer and
gene expression within the context of gene transfer approaches.

* Increased emphasis is needed on research dealing with the mechanisms
of disease pathogenesis.

* Investigators must strictly adhere to high standards in clinical
protocols.

* Broad interdisciplinary training of MD and PhD investigators at the
interface of clinical and basic science should be supported.

* Investigators in the field and their supporters need to be more
restrained in their public discussions of findings, publications and
gene therapy prospects.

* The NIH funding of gene therapy is currently adequate. Future gene
research should compete with other forms of biomedical research under
stringent peer review. The panel specifically did not recommend special
gene therapy or expansion of the recently funded core vector production
programme.

* The NIH should encourage collaborative arrangements between academic
institutions and industry that complement the NIH supported research.

* The NIH's intramural research programme needs better coordination of
its scientific review of gene research being undertaken throughout the
NIH's intramural research programme to avoid duplication of effort and
improve gene research.

US FDA YEAR-END APPROVALS

WASHINGTON, DC - The US Food and Drug Administration was busy before it
started celebrating the Christmas and New Year season. It was a good
thing too, because between the 8 and 15 January the agency hibernated
from the two feet snow storm and the Martin Luther King federal
holiday.

Three biotechnology products were approved before the tremendous slow
down:

* Amplified Mycobacterium TB Direct Test made by Gen-Probe was approved
on the 18 December, as a fast, new laboratory test to help detect the
bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The test was approved for use only
on specimens of sputum that an acid fast stain has already shown are
likely to be positive for TB bacteria. Expedited review was undertaken
by the agency because of its importance to the public health in the
control of tuberculosis.

The FDA notes that not all patients with TB have the bacteria in their
sputum. For those who do, however, the new test provides reliable,
specific results in four to five hours compared with the conventional
culture methods which require one to eight weeks for reliable results.

By obtaining results more quickly, the new test will enable doctors to
begin antibiotic treatment earlier. The clinical studies on the safety
and efficacy of the test submitted by the manufacturer was reviewed by
the Microbiology Devices Panel of the FDA's Medical Devices Advisory
Committee in May 1995. The studies showed that the new test was 95.5
per cent sensitive to detect the TB bacteria that had been identified
by the acid fast stain and followed up with a culture. Because of
concern over false negative results, the FDA is requiring that the test
be used along with conventional acid fast stain, then followed up with
a culture to confirm the presence of TB.

* Anagen of the UK received FDA clearance on the 20 December for its
new assay to measure testosterone. The developer of automated
immunoassay systems announced that this marks a range of 16 assays
cleared by the FDA for sale on its AuraFlex automated immunoassay
system. Two more assays have completed development with two more close
to completion. Regulatory submissions for these assays will be made
through new marketing partners when arrangements have been made.

Anagen suffered a major setback when Organon Technik unexpectedly
pulled out as a worldwide distributor for the company's lead product,
AuraFlex, the automated in vitro immunodiagnostic testing machine,
designed by Anagen and built by contractors. Confident of securing a
marketing deal soon, the company expects sales to flow within the first
half of 1996.

* Leukine (sargramostim) was approved on the 22 December, for patients
undergoing certain types of blood-cell transplants. The drug, developed
by Immunex, had won approval earlier in the year for treatment of
patients undergoing bone marrow transplants from matched donors and for
patients with a form of leukaemia. The procedure for blood-cell
transplants includes harvesting of blood from patients before
chemotherapy, isolating progenitor cells and then reintroducing them
after chemotherapy to aid recovery. Clinical studies have shown that
Leukine helped increase the number of progenitor cells collected and
aided in white blood-cell recovery after transplant.

Immunex claims that Leukine is the first growth factor indicated for
use in gathering peripheral blood progenitor cells after transplant.
The FDA has declined approval to market the drug in the general
chemotherapy market.

FDA ADDRESSES INFO DISSEMINATION

WASHINGTON, DC - The US Food and Drug Administration has posted notices
on Advertising and Promotion; Draft Guidances.

The two draft guidance documents are entitled: Guidance to Industry on
Dissemination of Reprints of Certain Published, Original Data and
Guidance for Industry Funded Dissemination of Reference Texts. They are
directed to the sponsors of human and animal drugs, medical devices and
biological products to inform them as to what published material is
permitted to be disseminated when discussing FDA approved products.

The FDA has taken the position that sponsors may not disseminate
information inconsistent with the FDA-approved labelling or cleared
use(s). Inconsistent information may be in conflict with the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. Permitting
inconsistent information to be distributed by sponsors would encourage
them not to carry out the clinical studies to verify the product is
safe and effective for its unproved use. Also information put out by a
biased source has the potential to mislead healthcare professionals.

At present the FDA has proposed to modified two of its policies which
would allow sponsors to distribute information under certain
circumstances. In the case of distribution of reprints of published,
original data, sponsors may disseminate information and data that the
agency relied on for its approval or clearance, even though these may
contain information different from the approved labelling. This can
only be done, however, if the article published the original efficacy
trials in accordance with the regular peer-review procedure of the
journal.

The reprint must be from a bona fide peer-reviewed journal that uses
experts in the field to review articles. If the information is
different from the approved labelling, the reprint must prominently
state the differences on a sticker attach to the reprint.

The second modification proposed concerned industry-funded
dissemination of reference texts. The FDA will permit distribution of
sound, authoritative materials that are not false or misleading and
were written and published independently of the commercial interest of
the sponsor.

The reference text must not be written, edited, excerpted, or published
specifically for the sponsor. The text should not be reviewed, edited
or influenced by the sponsor or its agent. The sponsor is not to be the
sole distributor of the text; rather there should be other distribution
channels where similar books are normally available.

Furthermore, the text should not focus on any specific drug(s),
device(s), or biologic(s) of the disseminating sponsor. Specific
product information should not be physically appended to the reference
text.

AMGEN ENHANCES KIDNEY FAILURE RESEARCH

THOUSAND OAKS, CA - Amgen has enhanced its research into kidney failure
through a tie-up with NPS Pharmaceuticals.

The two companies will collaborate on the development and
commercialisation of NPS' Norcalcin and other compounds based on NPS'
proprietary calcium receptor technology for the treatment of
hyperparathyroidism (HPT), one form of which is commonly seen as a
result of kidney failure.

Amgen already has a strong presence in the renal community as a result
of Epogen which combats the anaemia experienced by chronic renal
failure patients on dialysis.

"Amgen is a particularly appropriate partner for the development of
Norcalcin because of its extremely strong presence in the renal field
and its growing interest in endocrinology", said Hunter Jackson,
president and chief executive officer of NPS.

In addition, Amgen has already worked with Kirin, NPS' corporate
partner for Norcalcin in Asia, noted Dr Jackson: "This combination of
corporate partners provides the financial resources and outstanding
development capabilities to expedite the thorough development of
Norcalcin".

$10 million licence fee

Under the terms of the agreement, NPS will receive from Amgen an
initial licence fee of $10 million, potential additional milestone
payments totalling $26 million, plus royalties on product sales. Amgen
will also purchase one million shares of NPS common stock for $7.5
million, at the market price of the company's shares in November when
negotiations began. NPS expects to have around $25 million in cash
after closing the agreement with Amgen.

Amgen will receive exclusive worldwide rights, excluding Japan, China,
Korea and Taiwan, to develop and sell Norcalcin, which is currently in
Phase I/II clinical trials, and certain other compounds for the
treatment of HPT. Both companies will participate in development, but
Amgen will pay all costs to develop and commercialise products.

SUGEN/AMGEN END COLLABORATION

REDWOOD CITY, CA - Sugen and Amgen announced that they have terminated
their four-year research collaboration in neurobiology and
haematopoiesis one year earlier than planned.

The aim of the collaboration, set up in 1992, was to identify novel
signal transduction targets for therapeutic intervention against
certain neurological and haematopoietic disorders.

The deal was, however, struck when Sugen was in its infancy and was
essentially a technology company with no specific disease focus.
Although the deal was a significant boost for Sugen and brought in much-
needed funds, the research did not subsequently fit within its core
disease targets, a company spokesperson told Biotechnology Business
News.

Later, when Amgen bought the faltering US biotechnology company,
Synergen, it acquired its own, in-house neurobiological speciality,
changing the role of the external collaboration.

Sugen noted that it was disappointed by the early wind-up, but added
that the redeployment of 50 per cent of its research staff from the
Amgen/Sugen focus to its own programmes should benefit the company in
the long term.

The status of the research programme will be reviewed to see what Sugen
has and progress will be evaluated, but no concentrated research effort
in this field is planned, they noted.

Sugen plans to assess the implications of the aborted agreement on the
allocation of its internal research resources and its corporate
partnering opportunities over the coming months.

An amicable split

The termination is described by both companies as amicable and they
maintain a "positive corporate relationship", which could lead to
future collaborations, commented the spokesperson.

Under the terms of the early conclusion of the deal, Amgen will make a
final payment to Sugen of $2.5 million. Amgen is also granting back to
Sugen exclusive worldwide rights to 22 proprietary signal transduction
targets discovered in the course of the collaboration, subject to
royalty payments back to Amgen with respect to potential future product
sales.

In addition, Sugen is buying back from Amgen 235,000 shares of Sugen
common stock at $11.48 per share, thereby reducing Amgen's current
Sugen shareholding to 153,000. At the same time, Amgen will purchase
from Sugen for $200,000 a seven-year warrant to buy 200,000 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $15.50 per share.

Sugen does not expect the terms of the wind-up to have a material
effect on its 1995 and 1996 profit and loss statements.

EU DEBATE ON BIOTECH: STILL CIRCULAR, BUT A WIDER CIRCLE

BRUSSELS - There was more than a slight sense of deje vu to the high-
profile European Union Biotechnology Conference held in Brussels on the
11 January.

The agenda was familiar - research and public perception, the
regulatory framework, and competitiveness. So too were many of the
arguments - ranging from the most bullish predictions of biotech's
potential for creating jobs, wealth and well-being, through to dire
warnings of the risks it presents to health, ethics and the
environment. Even many of the speakers were veterans of this long-
running EU debate, which has, over recent years, seemed increasingly
circular.

The real novelty of this meeting was the fact that it brought together
a wider range of participants - and particularly all three of the key
EU institutions: the Parliament, which had provided much of the impetus
behind the meeting, and was represented by some 30 members, including
four chairmen of relevant committees; the Commission, which formally
organised it and fielded an unprecedented high-level turnout, including
five commissioners and the secretary general; and the Council of
Ministers, with representatives of all the Member States, in many cases
at the level of senior national officials, and in some cases at
ministerial level.

European Commission President Jacques Santer had given his full
blessing to the meeting (he was prevented from attending in person only
by the funeral of the former French president Francois Mitterand), and
sent a message stressing that information, transparency and dialogue
are the appropriate responses to criticisms, doubts and fears that
biotech has generated. The Commission acknowledges that public
authorities will also have to address the issue of "technology
aversion" that biotech has raised.

European Parliament Vice-President Nicole Fontaine welcomed the
opportunity for the "trialogue" (in the jargon of Brussels) to address
biotech - one of the "great themes of today" - in a broad context.
Current or recent EP debates touching on specific aspects of biotech -
on patents, employment opportunities, regulation, research and ethics -
had demonstrated how much biotech raised "the most fundamental
questions touching human beings and their dignity", she said.

Professor Giovanni Zanetti, Italian Under Secretary of State for
Industry, as the representative of the EU Presidency, expressed
optimism at the conclusion of the meeting that the exchanges had helped
build a sounder base for moving the discussion forward towards
consensus.

But even if the debate is now wider, there were no more conclusions
from this conference on EU biotech policy than there have been from the
many earlier meetings on the subject in Brussels and Strasbourg. It
certainly offered an opportunity for everyone involved to get to know
the points of view of the EU institutions and Member States, as Nicole
Fontaine observed - which meant that the voices of the biotech backers
and its opponents were louder than ever. It is less certain that the
trialogue thus launched will lead to the hoped for "consensus on the
distinct concrete issues", she commented.

The European Commission stressed its now well-established view that
biotech is "one of the most promising and crucial technologies for the
next century", suggesting that European biotech generates turnover of
Ecu450 billion a year and in the sectors where it has a direct impact,
it accounts for 9 per cent of EU gross value added and more than 8 per
cent of its employment - more than nine million jobs in
biopharmaceuticals, agriculture and food processing (notably crops and
micro-organisms), and biofuels, bioremediation, and chemicals.

But it recognises that the challenge for the EU is now to ensure that
output, employment and investment takes place in the EU, rather than
the EU becoming just a market - it must decide now whether to be a
producer, or merely a consumer, as Commission Vice-President Martin
Bangemann expressed it. "The world moves on, even if we do not", he
warned in sombre mood.

His views were vehemently supported by the UK Under Secretary of State
for Science and Technology, Ian Taylor, who described the evidence of
Europe's competitive disadvantage as "alarming". In his view, the risk
was that the gap would widen unless EU attitudes to biotech changed and
a more encouraging environment was created, with faster and more
flexible decision-making, strong patents, and an open single market.
"We should not exaggerate the risks by inventing mythical problems", he
asserted, "what on earth are we doing trying to invent problems", he
asked.

In the Commission's analysis, the EU's global position in biotech is
not what it should be. Although it has major core companies and an
excellent research and development base, there are only some 485
biotech companies in the EU (a declining number), compared with 1,300
in the US. The EU trails the US on biotech patents: between 1978 and
June 1994, EU-based firms filed fewer patents at the European Patent
Office than their US counterparts, and in the pharmaceutical sector, 65
per cent of the biotech patents worldwide are US, against 15 per cent
European. EU investment and research spending is relatively low:
between 1986 and the end of 1994, EU-based firms invested more than
Ecu2.8 billion in the US and Ecu600 million in Japan; and EU R&D
investment in biotech, both from public and private sources, is only
Ecu2.2 billion a year, compared with more than Ecu7 billion in the US
and Ecu 2.4 billion in Japan. Heinrich Kolb, Secretary of State in the
German Ministry of Economic Affairs, confirmed that Germany was also
suffering from an outward shift in biotech investment.

The Commission also admits that the EU regulatory framework has not
proved to be so favourable for innovation and technology diffusion:
there are no uniform patent rules;  current regulatory oversight of
biotech at the R&D stage is "not well-adapted", since it makes no
distinction between high-risk and low-risk areas, despite the fact that
much of the research in biopharmaceuticals and agriculture consists of
operations with low or negligible risk; and for important areas such as
novel foods, product legislation is still pending. Even President
Santer's message to the meeting recognised explicitly that in the
biotech sector "more and more often European firms prefer to invest
elsewhere than in Europe".

The Commission defends its own record on behalf of the sector, pointing
out that it has been active in promoting new legislation and seeking to
bring older legislation up to date. It proposed amendments at the end
of 1995 to Directive 90/219 on the contained use of genetically
modified micro-organisms, aimed at a more risk-based regulation. It
also approved a new proposal for a Directive on the legal protection of
biotech inventions. It is at present carrying out a review of Directive
90/220 on controlled release, and a report is expected shortly
identifying the weaknesses of the current rules and the scope for
eliminating or reducing regulatory redundancies without jeopardising
safety.

In addition, the new novel foods regulation, already in the
consultation process (currently at second reading before the
Parliament), aims, says the Commission, at ensuring safety, consumer
protection and information, while permitting smooth operation of the
internal market, without placing unjustified burden on users and
without stigmatising the use of modern biotech.

President Santer added that in this context the Commission aimed to
review some agriculture rules during 1996 and to see what could be done
to stimulate further innovation among smaller biotech firms.

The Commission also offered encouragement to Member States in their
efforts to create a favourable investment climate (especially through
the development of science parks to stimulate biotech diffusion among
small and medium-sized companies). But it is up to the firms themselves
to develop modern biotech-based activities to a critical size, says the
Commission. The public authorities' role is to create appropriate
framework conditions that ensure product approval according to criteria
of efficacy, safety and performance, and regulatory oversight based on
sound scientific principles.

Commissioner Mario Monti, the sponsor of the new proposal the
Commission launched in December 1995 to provide legal protection for
biotech inventions (BBN No 116, 19 December 1995, page 1), said the
motivation behind the new draft was the same as that behind the
proposal that was thrown out by the EP early in 1995 after seven years
of discussion: to bring EU patent laws up to date, and to remove the
"unacceptable" uncertainty that continues to reign on patent rights on
biotech.

To overcome the reticences over the failed proposal, the new draft aims
to meet the "complementary" demands of all sides: the clear line the EP
called for between what may be patented, and what may not be; and the
Council's demand for a text that provided a clear framework and a level
of protection sufficient to promote R&D, said Commissioner Monti.

European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler noted biotech's
potential "to introduce improvements in crops and animals which will
have direct and beneficial effects on food quality and the non-food
uses of crops". But at the same time, he warned that this will occur
only if "consumers of agricultural products can be persuaded that
biotech is being used in a responsible and ethical way". Just because a
technique can be used does not mean that it ought to be used, he said,
suggesting that consumers "will judge each case on its merits". So
unless biotech and its benefits are explained to the population in a
comprehensive way, advances will continue to be jeopardised by lack of
knowledge and "we may lose the benefits which biotech has to offer".

For crops, the Agriculture Commissioner listed scrupulously the
advantages of biotech techniques that are creating disease and pest
resistance, diagnostic agents, mechanisms to insert desired production
and quality characteristics, and the introduction of resistance to
undesirable environmental factors, as well as improvements to
hardwoods, cotton and other fibre crops, such as flax, and crops
engineered to provide wood, starch, oils, fats, and polysaccharides, or
to produce energy.

He was equally exhaustive in his listing of advances in livestock
farming, for animal nutrition, and in the control of human and animal
diseases.

Commissioner Fischler was notably reserved on the genetic modification
of farm animals. While techniques to produce pharmaceutical products
(such as sheep able to produce human blood-clotting factors in their
milk) were relatively uncontroversial, "attempts to produce so-called
super animals have not been successful and, indeed, may in the long
term be fruitless", he said.

While it is possible to insert genetic material coding for extra growth
hormone production into the fertilised eggs of farm animals, "it has
not yet proved possible to control the expression of these genes in the
whole animal", he insisted, noting that "the uncontrolled expression of
growth hormones results in gross and unacceptable deformity and
suffering", and questioning "whether it is economically or ethically
desirable", even if the process can be fully controlled.

Commissioner Fischler's ambivalence was mirrored in the remarks of MEPs
such as Karl von Wogau, chairman of the EP's Committee on Economic
Affairs and Industrial Policy, who endorsed the call for progress, but
insisted on the need to respect ethics and public opinion. Other MEPs,
notably Green champion Hiltrud Breyer, were more uncompromising,
insisting that the EU's current legislation is better for the biotech
industry than the US system, offering more stability. It would be
unhelpful for industry to start modifying that framework again, so soon
after creating it, she argued; the only area she wanted to see changed
was tighter controls to prevent "poor-quality investments" such as, she
instanced, in the development of recombinant BST.

The Senior Advisory Group on Biotechnology said in advance of the
meeting that it wants: action on a coherent overall policy promoting
European biotech; steady macro-economic policies to attract investment;
regulatory simplification; consistent Single Market rule for novel
foods and patents; better links between innovative research and
funding; encouragement for capital investment in biotech start-ups;
more efforts to inform the public; employment-friendly conditions;
improved education and training; and promotion of the use of biotech to
manage the sustainable use of natural resources.

After the meeting, the SAGB's new Director General, Andrew Dickson,
told Biotechnology Business News that he felt the meeting had made a
useful contribution to "genuine dialogue", and that he perceived a
growing trend of support for industry views.

The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations said
it hoped the meeting would help underline the importance of biotech for
the future development of the EU. It wants to see "a policy framework
to enhance competitiveness and create favourable conditions for
industrial activities related to biotech".

It remains to be seen how far the widening of the EU circular debate
will deliver any results that satisfy the "progressives" seeking
competitiveness without alienating the "conservatives" whose priorities
are more the ethical, social and environmental considerations,
producing nothing more than a new series of stalemates on creating
better conditions for biotech in Europe.

PROGENICS LICENSES MELANOMA VACCINE

TARRYTOWN, NY - Progenics has licensed a melanoma vaccine from the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

The vaccine, known as GMK, is one of the most clinically advanced
cancer vaccines and is the first of a new class of ganglioside
conjugate vaccines being developed by Progenics for cancer therapy.

Under the licensing agreement, Progenics receives a worldwide exclusive
licence to the ganglioside conjugate vaccine platform technology for
cancer treatment.

Two Phase III clinical trials, designed to meet US and worldwide
approval requirements, are expected to begin early this year. They will
involve high-risk melanoma patients in the US and Europe.

The US trial will be conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group in conjunction with the Memorial Sloan-Kettering and other
hospitals and clinics in the US. The second study will be carried out
by the Institute of Cancer Research/Royal Cancer hospital in the UK, in
association with other European hospitals and clinics.

Progenics is also planning clinical trials this year with a second
ganglioside conjugate vaccine, MGV, for the treatment of other cancers.

In a separate transaction, Progenics signed a worldwide exclusive
licence and supply agreement with Cambridge Biotech of Worcester,
Massachusetts, for the immunological adjuvant, QS-21, for use in GMK
and certain other ganglioside conjugate vaccines for the treatment of
cancer. Specific financial terms were not disclosed.

Melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is on the increase in
the industrialised world. Around 37,000 new cases of melanoma were
reported in the US in 1994. By the turn of the century, it is estimated
that one in 90 Americans will develop melanoma.

IDEC AND EISAI TARGET AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

SAN DIEGO, CA - IDEC Pharmaceuticals said it has signed a research and
development agreement with Eisai of Japan to target autoimmune disease.

The two companies will focus specifically on the development of
humanised and Primatised antibodies against the gp39 antigen. This
antigen, also known as the CD40 ligand, is an essential immune system
trigger for B cell activation and antibody production.

Potential target indications include antibody-mediated autoimmune
diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and systemic
lupus erythematosus.

The agreement calls for Eisai to provide up to $37.5 million in licence
fee payments and R&D support at IDEC. In return, Eisai will receive
exclusive rights to develop and market resulting products in Japan,
Asia and Europe, for which IDEC would receive royalties. IDEC has
retained all rights to North America and certain other markets.

This transaction is IDEC's fifth R&D collaboration to date and the
fourth related to the company's proprietary Primatised antibody
technology.

HOECHST/RPR FORM WORLD-LEADING PLASMA CO

NEW YORK, NY - Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer have formed a 50:50
joint venture creating the world's leading global plasma protein
company.

The $1.2 billion new company, known as Centeon, has been set up with
the assets of Hoechst and RPR's plasma-protein activities, from
Behringwerke and Armour Pharmaceutical respectively.

"Our strategy is clear", said Centeon chief executive officer John
Sedor, "Centeon will invest in research and development to lead the
plasma protein industry in accelerating the availability of new
products from human plasma and through biotechnology."

The size of Centeon's operations will benefit the company in a sector
characterised by regionalised companies, giving it the critical mass
and market access to meet patient needs worldwide.

Plasma protein products are used in the treatment of immune
deficiencies, trauma, coagulation disorders, bone marrow transplants
and neurological disorders. Centeon aims to provide a comprehensive
range of plasma products in all of the therapeutic applications,
including antihaemophilic factors, immunoglobulins, plasma substitutes,
wound healing agents and inhibitor treatments.

Double the investment

R&D investment will be at twice the combined level currently invested
by Behringwerke and Armour, ie around $60-80 million a year. Work will
focus primarily on: rDNA technology - the development of therapeutics
prepared by recombinant technology that improves the treatment of
haemophilia; gene therapy - the repair of genetic defects, the
replacement of missing genes, and the use of non-plasma therapies; and
blood components - the investigation of modified blood components,
including red blood cells and lyophilised platelets for use in
transfusion medicine.

As well as correlative R&D strengths and product lines, Armour and
Behringwerke bring geographical complementarity to Centeon. Armour has
a strong presence in the US, while Behringwerke is a leader in Europe
and Japan - three markets that make up three-quarters of the plasma
protein therapies industry.

Centeon is headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, with
corporate functions in both the US and Germany. The company will employ
4,500 people worldwide and has plasma fractionation plants in Kankakee,
Illinois (US), and in the European cities of Marburg (Germany),
Strasbourg (France), Vienna (Austria) and Barcelona (Spain).

RGENE STRIKES GENE DELIVERY DEAL

THE WOODLANDS, TX - RGene Therapeutics has formed a licensing agreement
with Pasteur Merieux-Connaught, covering the use of DC-cholesterol as a
gene delivery system.

DC-cholesterol, RGene's proprietary cationic lipid, will be exclusively
licensed to Pasteur Merieux-Connaught for use as an immunoadjuvant in
traditional vaccines. "We believe that DC-cholesterol will benefit the
development of our next generation of vaccines", said chairman and
chief executive officer of Pasteur Merieux-Connaught, Jean-Jacques
Bertrand.

RGene is developing DC-cholesterol as a gene delivery method for
nucleic acids. It is the only non-viral gene delivery system to date
that has demonstrated in two published human clinical trials, effective
gene delivery.

In addition, animal studies using RGene's gene therapeutic, RGG0853
(the suppressor gene E1A, complexed with DC-cholesterol), have shown
that gene delivery by DC-cholesterol provides antitumour activity
comparable to genes delivered by the adenovirus vector.

CUBIST IN DEAL WITH PFIZER

CAMBRIDGE, MA - Cubist Pharmaceuticals said it has formed a research
and licensing deal with Pfizer to develop and market new antibacterial
drugs.

Resistant pathogens and other organisms which lack adequate therapy are
significant clinical problems. Pathogens, such as Staphylococcus
aureus, Enterococcus species and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause
diseases including skin, soft tissue, bloodstream, urinary, respiratory
and ear infections, have now been identified as being resistant to most
available antibiotics.

The companies will collaborate on the discovery of novel broad-spectrum
antibacterial agents directed towards specific aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase targets with activity against resistant pathogens.

Initially, Pfizer will use its diverse chemical library and expertise
in high-throughput screening to identify lead compounds that inhibit
the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Cubist will provide proprietary
biomolecular targets and assay systems.

Pfizer will fund research at Cubist for the progression of lead
compounds. As drug discovery and development advances, Pfizer will have
the option to make an equity investment and will be responsible for
clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of the
antibacterials.

Cubist will receive an upfront technology access fee, milestone
payments throughout the course of drug development and royalties on
product sales. In return, Pfizer obtains worldwide licensing rights to
market antibacterial agents developed during the collaboration.

Specific terms of the agreement were not reported.

ALEXION FACES FIERCE COMPETITION

NEW HAVEN, CT - The US biotechnology company, Alexion Pharmaceuticals,
has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to sell two
million common shares through a public offering.

The company plans to sell the shares at $8-9 a share and expects to
raise about $14.8 million, after expenses. The public, after the sale
is completed, will own about 29.4 per cent of the company's outstanding
6.78 million shares. US Surgical holds a 9.5 per cent stake in the
company.

In October, Alexion was awarded a $2 million grant from the US
Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and
Technology's Advanced Technology programme. The award was to help
support its programme to develop genetically engineered pig organs for
transplantation into patients without clinical rejection.

Alexion's genetically altered pig organs express an inhibitor of human
complement inflammatory proteins to thwart organ rejection. The company
expects to develop a colony of transgenically engineered pigs and to
implant their organs into primates within 15 to 20 months, followed by
human implantation.

Developing genetically altered pigs for human implantation has become
extremely competitive as companies strive to be major players in what
is seen as a $1 million annual market. Pigs have been selected because
their organs are similar in size to humans and they can be raised, free
of disease, in large numbers. Human DNA is injected into fertilised pig
eggs in the effort to have the pigs produce proteins that act to
suppress the organ rejection response.

Three other companies are also actively and competitively engaged in
this market - Immutran in Cambridge, UK, has been working to transplant
pig hearts into baboons. BioTransplant (Cambridge, Massachusetts), in
collaboration with researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, is
developing immunosuppressive drugs to ensure tolerance to cross-species
implantation. They have also used primates to accept donor organs from
genetically in-bred pigs. The Swiss company, Sandoz, is helping to fund
both these efforts and expects to spend about $1 billion on this work
during the next couple of years.

In July, New Jersey-based Nextran and Duke University Medical Center
obtained clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration to provide
genetically modified pig livers as temporary organ support to patients
with end-stage liver disease. It is believed that the livers, placed
outside the body and lasting one day (then replaced by a new pig
liver), will provide patient support until a donor becomes available or
the patient's own liver regenerates.

The United Network for Organ Sharing claims that there are 18,000
heart, kidney and liver transplants performed in the US each year.
There are, however, 40,000 qualified patients waiting for usable
organs. Additionally, there are over 100,000 patients, who are
classified as unqualified because of age or disease progression, who
die annually for lack of suitable organs. The US spends $6 billion
annually to provide dialysis for 150,000 renal patients; a significant
proportion of which could be saved were kidney organs for
transplantation available.

PEPTOR COMPLETES SECOND FINANCING

Ness Ziona - Peptor, an Israeli start-up company developing peptide
drugs, has raised $9 million in a private placement to US institutional
investors. The company was valued at $23 million before the offering.

Although the company is only three years old, this is its second
private placement. Two years ago, it raised $10 million from Israeli
and US investors.

Peptor hopes to use this latest round of investment to take its two
major products - an analogue of somatostatin for the treatment of
gastrointestinal disease, and a library of peptides for an antifungal
peptide developed by Xoma - to US Food and Drug Administration approved
clinical trials by 1997.

Yoram Karmon, chief executive officer of Peptor, says that there has
been pressure on the company to go public. He prefers, however, to wait
until the end of 1996 when Peptor will have achieved more milestones
and will thus have a greater value.

Peptor is currently negotiating a possible joint venture with the US
company, Neoprobe, and with a European multinational. Both of these
potential collaborations cover the development of peptides to treat
cancer.

SECOND BREAST CANCER GENE ISOLATED

LONDON & SALT LAKE CITY, UT - The second breast cancer gene, known as
BRCA2, has been isolated.

The UK charity, the Cancer Research Campaign (CRC), announced on the 20
December last year that a consortium led by a CRC-funded researcher,
had isolated the gene and a patent application had been filed.

On the same day as the CRC announcement, Myriad Genetics of the US said
it had filed a US patent application on the full sequence of a "strong
candidate for BRCA2 + [which] covers all diagnostic and therapeutic
uses of this newly discovered gene."

BRCA2 is thought to be a critical factor for more than one-third of
those families worldwide with a history of breast cancer in many female
relatives. It also plays a key role in the development of breast cancer
in men in these families.

In 1994, CRC researchers reported that BRCA1, the only gene at that
time known to be involved in hereditary breast cancer, was not
responsible for the disease in families which include male breast
cancer sufferers. They therefore concluded that another gene must be at
fault in these families and located BRCA2 six months later on
chromosome 13.

Mutations in BRCA2 are believed to be the cause of about 2 per cent of
all breast cancer cases, including a currently unquantifiable
proportion of the rare, but often fatal, form of the disease which
claims the lives of around 100 UK men every year.

More genes to be discovered?

Recent research suggests that BRCA1 accounts for almost half of the
1,000 plus known breast cancer families in the UK, while BRCA2 is
probably responsible for a third. This supports the theory that one or
more family breast cancer genes may remain to be discovered. Scientists
also believe that BRCA1 and BRCA2 are connected to an increased
incidence of some other cancers, such as prostate and eye cancer.
However, the lifetime risks of developing these cancers are much lower
than for breast cancer.

In isolating BRCA2, the CRC researchers at the Institute of Cancer
Research worked as part of an international collaboration involving
Wellcome Trust-funded scientists at the UK's Sanger Centre and Imperial
Cancer Research Fund, as well as with Duke University Medical Center in
North Carolina, US. Additional help came from groups in Iceland, the
Netherlands, France and Canada, and the breast cancer charity,
Breakthrough.

The next stage of research will examine both the function of BRCA2 and
the consequences of gene damage, and the role of the gene in non-family
breast cancers.

The CRC's technology transfer arm, CRC Technology, filed a preliminary
UK patent application on the research findings in November. The claims
of the application have not yet been defined but are expected to cover
the gene sequence and its use for new approaches to the prevention,
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

Myriad

Myriad said that its scientists had cloned and obtained the complete
sequence of the gene and had confirmed through familial analysis of
breast cancer cases that mutations in it predispose certain women to
early onset of the disease.

Myriad comments that it expects to launch a test in the second half of
1996 for mutations in BRCA1, which was isolated by the company and
collaborators in 1994, and intends to develop a test that incorporates
BRCA2.

A spokesperson for CRC Technology told Biotechnology Business News that
it was unclear at present whether both patent applications covered the
same gene, but expected the position to be clarified in the near
future. They added that the CRC believes that it was the first to
isolate the gene.

Each year in the UK, more than 31,000 women have breast cancer newly
diagnosed and 14,500 die of the disease.

AGOURON TO STUDY NEW ANTICANCERS

SAN FRANCISCO, CA - Agouron Pharmaceuticals plans to initiate work on
two new anticancer drugs this year, according to company president and
chief executive officer, Peter Johnson.

Speaking at the Hambrecht & Quist 14th Annual Life Science Conference,
Mr Johnson told delegates that preclinical toxicology has begun for the
first product candidate, AG2034, an inhibitor of an enzyme required for
the synthesis of purine nucleotides essential for sustained
proliferation of cancer cells. AG2034 has shown potent antitumour
activity in preclinical animal models of cancer.

The second compound, AG3340, has been selected for development as an
anticancer from Agouron's programme to discover selective inhibitors of
matrix metalloprotease enzymes involved in cancer and arthritis. AG3340
has demonstrated significant antimetastatic and antitumour activity in
animal models, as well as oral bioavailability and a favourable
pharmacokinetic profile.

R&D update

Other research and development progress to date includes the completion
of a clinical programme of four-week pilot Phase II studies of several
different dose regimens of Agouron's anti-HIV product, Viracept
(nelfinavir mesylate, formerly known as AG1343). The studies
demonstrated that Viracept has potent acute activity against HIV.

The anticancer, Thymitaq (AG337), is being evaluated in six separate
Phase II clinical trials against solid tumours associated with lung,
colon, liver, pancreatic, prostate and head/neck cancers. The trials
have enrolled a total of 120 patients.

Mr Johnson noted that Agouron is in a "strong financial position" to
carry out its R&D programmes. In the current fiscal year to 30 June
1996, the company expects to report around $40 million in R&D-related
revenues from corporate partners and is positioned to fund the balance
of its near-term operating expenses from cash and short-term
investments currently in excess of $100 million.

SEQUANA LINKS GENE TO MELANOMA

SAN DIEGO, CA - Scientists at California-based Sequana Therapeutics
have identified a second gene responsible for malignant melanoma, a
deadly form of skin cancer related to over-exposure to the sun.

Around 33,000 people in the US a year are diagnosed with melanoma
resulting in about 7,000 deaths. However, most cases can be cured if
caught in the early stages.

Using DNA samples from the National Cancer Institute, Nicholas
Dracopoli and colleagues at Sequana examined DNA from members of
families with hereditary melanoma. After excluding families with
defects in a known cancer gene, the researchers found that two of the
affected families had a mutated form of the CDK4 gene.

The scientists identified a germline mutation (which means it can be
passed from parent to child) in the CDK4 gene and were able to screen
patients who inherited the defective form of CDK4 and advise those who
were most susceptible to developing the condition to get regular
testing to find the melanoma at an early stage.

Although it is unlikely that mutations in CDK4 will account for all of
the remaining cases of familial melanoma, this mutation suggests that
other genes in this pathway may be excellent candidates, note the
scientists in the January issue of Nature Genetics.

Sequana said it plans to seek patent protection for its discovery and
would continue to study what role the CDK4 gene plays in other forms of
cancer.

PERSONALITY GENE DISCOVERED

WASHINGTON, DC - Two groups of scientists working in different
countries have found a link between a gene that affects brain chemistry
and a normal aspect of personality, reported Nature Genetics.

Researchers from Herzog Memorial Hospital in Jerusalem led by Richard
Ebstei, and the Laboratory of Clinical Science at the National
Institute of Mental Health, led by Jonathan Benjamin, independently
tested a hypothesis advanced by Robert Cloninger and colleagues at the
Washington University School of Medicine: that novelty seeking
behaviour is affected by the way brain cells process dopamine, a neural
messenger chemical.

Both groups detected a correlation between different D4 dopamine
receptor genes (D4DR) and variation in a human personality trait. D4DR
comes in various alternative forms, some in a long series of sequences
and some in short. Those individuals with the long sequence score high
in the novelty seeking personality trait, making them "more
exploratory, thrill-seeking and excitable", write the researchers.
Those who have the shorter sequence score lower in the novelty seeking
behaviour, "more deliberate, rigid and orderly."

"This work provides the first replicated association between a specific
genetic locus involved in neurotransmission and a normal personality
trait. Given the significant hereditary nature of many human behaviours
and the rapid progress of the human genome project, it is likely that
additional genes that influence normal and abnormal psychological
characteristics will be found in the future," noted the Israeli
researchers.

All subjects in the two studies differed in age, sex and ethnic
background. In fact, the scientists also found that the relationship
between the long sequence and novelty seeking did not vary with age,
sex or ethnic background.

The US researchers noted that although the findings in the two studies
were remarkably similar, they do not feel that "novelty seeking is
completely mediated by genes and that D4DR accounts for some but not
all genetic defects."

LQT SYNDROME GENE FOUND

SALT LAKE CITY, UT - Researchers from the University of Utah (UT) have
identified a gene which has been linked to a rare inherited heart
ailment known as long-QT (LQT) syndrome which can cause sudden death in
otherwise healthy people.

Reported in the January issue of Nature Genetics, Mark Keating and UT
colleagues found the third gene, KVLTI, linked to the most common form
of LQT, afflicting some 50 to 60 per cent of all cases.

"KVLTI turns out to be a potassium channel that is also most likely
involved in cardiac repolarisation", noted the scientists. Six months
previously, the UT researchers had identified a pair of genes
responsible for two other forms of LQT. These were also ion channels,
another potassium channel and a sodium channel. The researchers expect
that this more common form of LQT should be able to respond to drugs
that open potassium channels.

Rapid progress anticipated

"With the majority of LQT cases now at least partially understood at
the molecular level, there should be rapid progress in finding out how
to treat these disorders", the researchers noted.

LQT syndrome, although rare, is well-known because it often results in
sudden death. LQT can be worsened by the use of some drugs,
particularly those used treat cardiac arrhythmias. The danger of the
use of such drugs and the deadly nature of the disorder makes early
detection vital. Dr Keating said the discovery of the third gene will
help in the early diagnosis of LQT.

LQT syndrome affects some 20,000 people in the US and is believed to
cause up to 20 deaths a year.

VANGUARD MEDICA said the investigational new drug application for the
anti-migraine compound, SB 209509, has been approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration. Phase II clinical trials have subsequently started
in North America. SB 209509 was discovered by SmithKline Beecham and is
being developed by Vanguard under the terms of a 1994 agreement for the
US and Europe. Vanguard will receive payments for the achievement of
milestones, a share of the future net operating receipts, and co-
promotion rights for the US market. SB 209509 has a pharmacological
profile which suggests it will be effective as a long-acting and well-
tolerated therapy with potential advantages over existing therapies.
The worldwide market for antimigraines is expected to be worth more
than $1.5 billion by the year 2000.

BIOTECH STOCKS SET TO POWER AHEAD

LONDON - Analysts remain highly positive on the sector's outlook, with
some of the smaller capitalised stocks set to make their mark in 1996.

Stanford Rook, founded by two microbiologists from University College,
floated in April 1995 and subsequently transferred to the UK
Alternative Investment Market, has attracted growing support. The
company's lead product is the immunotherapeutic, SRL 172, a new
tuberculosis treatment currently in Phase III trials in South Africa
and Phase II trials in the UK. Development programmes include work on
the application of SRL 172 as a treatment for cancer and HIV. Shares in
Stanford Rock have soared since the start of the year, up from 265p at
the 1995 year end to 375p on the 16 January, valuing the company at #66
million.

David Kennard, managing director and ex-Glaxo Wellcome, said: "The lead
indication of our lead product is TB and associated HIV-related
infection. We are well into Phase III studies - a 400-patient placebo
controlled study. We hope to launch the product in 1998. Being an
orphan drug status product, we hope to get a favourable review upon
submission."

"They have got some serious credibility behind them", observed an
analyst. "The rumour is that they have got some licensing deal coming
out with a major pharmaceutical firm in the near future, and that they
are now making noises that their immune stimulant is effective in
fighting Aids".

Chiroscience gained 9p at 323p on the 16 January on news that it has
gained regulatory approval for Phase II clinical studies of its single
isomer treatment, D3967, for hormonally sensitive breast cancers. This
is the company's third single isomer drug to go into the clinic. "The
approval to start the trials is goods news in that the company can step
forward, but it does not mean that they have a result that shows it
works yet", explained an analyst. Chiroscience is nonetheless seen as
one of the strongest stocks in the UK biotech sector.

Also tipped as undervalued are Cortecs and Scotia. The latter has
suffered over the past few months on reluctance among some investors to
accept the company's science. The shares however gained 20p to 583p on
the 16 January. "Many see the company more as a nutritional OTC
business rather than a biopharmaceutical company. The management of
Scotia have got more science credibility than many of the rest in the
sector", noted one analyst.

Cortecs has the potential to be one of the sector's best performing
stocks in 1996. It is riding high on the prospects for three major
trends in the pharmaceutical industry - the increasing resistance of
bacteria to antibiotics, osteoporosis and diabetes management. "Cortecs
has a lot to go for in those three years. If it gets its oral
calcitonin drug licensed out, and launches its diagnostics on to the
market, I can see the share price more than doubling", opined one City
follower.

Recently floated issues appear to be performing well. Peptide
Therapeutics, at around 220p, is holding steady at a 10 per cent
premium over its flotation price. KS Biomedix is trading up 15 per cent
on its recent placing, price while PolyMasc Pharmaceuticals is up
almost a third on its initial placing in December.

US analysts expect the recent pick-up in the biotech sector to continue
throughout 1996. Stocks are expected to appreciate on an anticipated
flow of positive product development news, with US Food and Drug
Administration approvals expected to sustain the sector's positive
investment climate.

Somatogen, up $1-7/8 at $20-5/8 in early January, is seen as one of the
most promising US biotech firms. Late Phase II clinical trials on its
blood substitute product have shown positive results. If successful,
the product has a $1 billion-plus market potential. One analyst set a
12-month price target of $50 on the stock.

Liposome shares fell $1-1/8 to $20-7/8 on the 12 January on news that
one analyst forecast a 12-month price target of $7.

Salomon Brothers rates Amgen one of the year's star stock picks,
arguing that with an estimated average annual earnings growth rate of
more than 20 per cent between 1996 and 1998, the shares are
significantly undervalued. Trading at $55-1/8 last week, Salomon has
set a one-year price target of $65. Both old and new products are said
to be selling well. On the development front, clinical trials are
expected to start this year on Leptin, Amgen's anti-obesity drug and
GDNF, for Parkinson's disease. The company is also expected to initiate
a pivotal Phase III clinical trial of MGDF, the platelet growth factor,
within the next few months.

OSTEOPOROSIS DRUGS RAISE HOPES FOR MAKING BONE AILMENT `THING OF THE PAST'

By:
By Michael Smith

   New drugs for osteoporosis -- some slowing bone loss and others building
bone -- will be hitting the market over the next few years and researchers
are optimistic they'll be able to cut the incidence of the disease 
dramatically.
   ``Theoretically, we can make osteoporosis a thing of the past,'' says
Anthony Hodsman, a clinician and osteoporosis researcher at the University
of Western Ontario in London, Ont. ``We have a better chance of removing
osteoporosis from the population than eliminating the cholesterol-related
diseases.''
   Currently, more than one woman in three over the age of 50 suffers
osteoporotic fractures caused by weakened bone. That percentage works out
to an estimated 25 million people in the U.S. As the Baby Boom aged, the
raw numbers had been expected to soar even if the percentage stayed
unchanged but now there's new hope for treatment. Men also suffer from
osteoporosis, but in fewer numbers and with a later onset.
   The body remodels bone continually, tearing it down and rebuilding, much
as the skin is continually made and sloughed off. Like the skin, bone grows
thinner with age as the rebuilding process loses ground. Key players in the
cycle are bone-destroying cells, called osteoclasts, and bone-building
cells, or osteoblasts.
   ``If you reform less bone than is being broken down,'' Hodsman says,
``you ultimately end up with less bone.'' There are two main approaches to
avoid bone loss -- prevent the bone breakdown or stimulate new growth.
``You either work on expenses or you work on income,'' Hodsman says.
   The main approach has been to tackle ``expenses'' -- preventing bone
resorption, or breakdown.
   Estrogen and estrogen-like molecules are perhaps prototypical. In the
absence of estrogen -- after menopause, for example -- bone resorption
gains the upper hand. The obvious solution is to replace the missing
hormone.
   And indeed millions of women across North America and Europe begin
hormone replacement therapy shortly after their menopause, with apparent
success in retaining healthy bone. The problem is that estrogen replacement
has side-effects that make it very unpopular with women -- headaches,
bloating, breast engorgement and, of course, the continuation or resumption
of the menstrual cycle. Estrogen has also been linked to some forms of
breast cancer.
   ``It's not very customer-friendly,'' Hodsman says. Less than 10 per cent
of women take estrogen for any length of time, leading him to say the
therapy is essentially a failure, even though it does prevent
osteoporosis.
   Until a few years ago, hormone replacement was almost the only treatment
option available to physicians. (The hormone calcitonin is approved for
osteoporosis and does increase bone mass, but it must be given by
injection, which is unpopular, and its effectiveness appears to diminish
over time.)
   But a range of new drugs -- the aminobisphosphonates or just
bisphosphonates -- is now reaching the market and their promise is
exciting.
   ``The advantage of the bisphosphonates is that they're entirely specific
to bone, while other drugs act on every tissue,'' says Marc Grynpas, a
biophysicist at the University of Toronto who's studying the long-term
effects of the drugs on bone strength and on body chemistry.
   On the other hand, Grynpas says, a drawback of bisphosphonates is that
they're not particularly well-absorbed by the body. The skeleton gets
perhaps 40 to 50 per cent of injected bisphosphonates and only about half a
per cent of oral formulations.
   The earliest of the bisphosphonates was etidronate, made and marketed by
Procter and Gamble under the name Didrocal. Although etidronate is approved
in many countries as a treatment for osteoporosis, it has never been given
the nod in the United States, largely because the clinical trials did not
attempt to show a reduction in fractures.
   But studies at the University of Western Ontario and elsewhere in the
early '80s clearly showed, Hodsman says, that etidronate increases bone
mass in osteoporotic patients and that was enough to prompt other
pharmaceutical companies to try their own hands at finding
bisphosphonates.
   The first into the market with FDA approval is Merck & Co., with a
bisphosphonate called alendronate and trade-named Fosamax. The company
submitted its NDA March 31 last year and got approval a mere six months
later on Sept. 29.
   Robert Lindsay, who's president of the National Osteoporosis Foundation
and director of the metabolic bone disease unit at St. Luke's Roosevelt
Hospital in New York, called alendronate ``pretty exciting. It gives us a
further option for women who cannot or won't take estrogen.''
   Alendronate is perhaps 1,000 times more potent than etidronate, Hodsman
says, which makes it easier for clinicians to use. A drawback with
etidronate was what Grynpas called its `'narrow therapeutic window'' -- too
little did nothing, too much actually damaged bone. Finding the small gap
between too little and too much was tricky.
   ``Because alendronate is a lot more potent,'' Hodsman says, it overcomes
that problem. ``You can afford to give it every day; it does the same job
as etidronate'' only more quickly and more efficiently.''
   It may even be appropriate to use alendronate and other third-generation
bisphosphonates as a preventive measure, he says.
   A Merck spokesman wouldn't comment on how well sales are going since the
Sept. 29 approval, but said the drug was available in pharmacies very
quickly afterward. The company says a month's supply should cost about $55;
the wholesale price per 10-milligram tablet is $1.39.
   Merck's data, from trials involving nearly 1,000 women, show mean
increases of up to 10 per cent on bone density in the lumbar spine. The
alendronate reduced the fracture rate by 48 per cent compared with the
placebo group.
   Side effects, Merck says, are mild -- abdominal and musculoskeletal
pain, as well as some digestive disturbance -- and generally don't cause
patients to stop taking the drug. In fact, more patients in the placebo
group than the drug group dropped out because of adverse reactions.
   Although Merck temporarily has the field to itself, a wave of
third-generation bisphosphonates is coming down the pipe and they're all,
Hodsman says, ``serious contenders.''
   -- Sanofi Winthrop Inc. has tiludronate in Phase III trials. A spokesman
said a New Drug Application for Paget's disease -- a rare bone degenerative
illness -- will be made soon but couldn't say when the NDA for osteoporosis
would be filed.
   -- Boehringer Mannheim Corp. is in Phase II/Phase III trials with
ibandronate. A spokesman wouldn't speculate on when the trials will
conclude. Interestingly, the company has equipped a Bluebird motor home
with bone-scanning equipment and is using it to conduct the Phase III part
of the trial in rural Montana.
   -- Procter and Gamble Corp. is in Phase III trials with risedronate. A
spokesman wouldn't say when an NDA filing is expected.
   -- Ciba-Geigy Inc. has stopped work on one bisphosphonate and is in what
a spokesman called ``early development'' with another. Ciba is no longer
studying pamidronate for osteoporosis, although it is approved for some
other kinds of bone deficiencies, and is doing preliminary work on
zoledronate.
   The bisphosphonates aren't the only anti-resorptive approach. Eli Lilly
Co., of Indianapolis, is in Phase III trials on raloxifene, which is,
Hodsman says, ``a very interesting drug.''
   Raloxifene, initially developed as an anti-cancer agent, is one of a
group of compounds known as selected estrogen receptor modulators -- they
target different receptors differently.
   Raloxifene appears to block only gender-specific estrogen receptors --
those found in the uterus and breast -- while actually boosting
non-specific receptors. The result appears to be an estrogen-like
inhibition of bone resorption, without the side-effects of estrogen
itself.
   ``It seems fairly close to a magic bullet,'' Hodsman says. ``It might
actually reduce breast cancer risk while doing what you'd like an estrogen
to do -- slow bone resorption'' and thus prevent osteoporosis.
   Kelly Sego, a spokesman for Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, said raloxifene
isn't the only arrow in the company's quiver, although it's the most
advanced. ``We're also looking at any number of derivatives of
raloxifene,'' she said.
   The company's ``best case'' date for an NDA filing would be sometime in
1997, Sego said. Eli Lilly started Phase III trials in January, 1994, and
plans to look at interim data in mid-'96, she said. ``If those data show
what we think they'll show,'' she said, ``then we'll start working on an
NDA.''
   An attack on the other half of Hodsman's equation -- ``income'' or
building bone -- is also imminent. Mission Pharmacal of San Antonio, Texas,
is on the verge of getting the go-ahead to market a slow-release
formulation of sodium fluoride.
   The FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee
recommended approval for the drug Nov. 17, but a company spokesman didn't
know when the final marketing approval would come through.
   Sodium fluoride, in conjunction with calcium citrate supplements, has
long been known to increase bone mass, but it also causes severe
gastrointestinal distress, including gastric ulcers.
   The slow-release formulation -- a honeycomb wax tablet that allows the
mineral to bypass the stomach and dissolve slowly in the intestines --
appears to avoid the harmful side-effects.
   The trials showed a 70 per cent decline in the spinal fracture rate
among treated patients and increases in bone mass in the spine of up to 6
per cent a year.
   There had been fears that bone growth stimulated by sodium fluoride
would be histologically abnormal but Charles Y.C. Pak of the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who conducted the trials,
said, ``We not only found more bone in the patients we studied, but what
appears to be stronger bone.''
   The treatment regime -- 25 milligrams twice a day, combined with 400
milligrams of calcium citrate -- will cost less than $1 a day, a company
spokesman said, making it cheaper than alendronate. However, the
therapeutic window for sodium fluoride is regarded as narrow.
   Meanwhile, Toronto's Allelix Biopharmaceuticals is in the last stages of
a year-long search for an industrial partner for Phase III trials of its
recombinant parathyroid hormone (rPTH). A spokesman said a deal is likely
to be announced in the first two week of 1996.
   The drug -- Allelix calls it ALX1-11 -- has been in Phase II trials at
18 centers across Canada and the U.S. and so far data show it can add
``significant amounts of new bone in osteoporotic patients,'' accord to
John Dietrich, the company's vice-president of research and clinical
development.
   Hodsman said the bone-building effect of PTH has been known since the
'70s, but before Allelix learned how to produce a recombinant form it was
too scarce to be of any use. `'You had to do large studies,'' Hodsman said
-- something that was impossible without large supplies of the hormone.
   He said studies using the hormone -- both recombinant and natural --
have ``consistently shown that bone mass is increased at least as fast as
(sodium) fluoride and fluoride is double the speed of anything else.''
   But the advantage of PTH, he said, is that there's no toxicity and the
bone it builds in patients is probably normal. In animals, bone built by
Allelix's rPTH has been shown to be histologically normal.
   PTH is a major regulator of the speed of bone remodelling, Hodsman says,
but the mechanism isn't completely clear. ``We don't fully understand why
PTH works as well as it does,'' he said.
   For instance, he said, it has been shown that osteoclasts
(bone-resorbing cells) are much less vigorous when they are exposed to
bisphosphonates. ``With PTH, we don't even know as much as that,'' he said.
``It could be it makes osteoblasts more vigorous or it could be that it
recruits osteoblasts'' by stimulating the bone marrow to produce more of
them.
   With all those drugs in the pipeline, people at risk from osteoporosis
have a bright future, Hodsman says: ``We're on the cusp of revolutionizing
the management of osteoporosis.''

HEREDITY PLAYS ROLE IN OSTEOPOROSIS, BUT GENETIC LINK PROVES ELUSIVE

By:
MS

   Heredity clearly plays a role in the likelihood of developing
osteoporosis, but researchers are not entirely sure if there is a direct
genetic key to the disease, according to Laurence Rubin, who studies the
condition at Women's College Hospital in Toronto.
   In 1994, a team of Australian researchers reported that the gene that
codes for the Vitamin D receptor is linked to the speed at which people
lose bone mass as they grow older.
   The Australians, led by John Eisman of the Garvan Institute of Medical
Research in Sydney, say they can predict the approximate age of onset of
osteoporosis depending on which alleles of the Vitamin D receptor gene are
found.
   But other researchers aren't convinced: the September issue of the
Journal of Bone Mineralogy Research devotes space for three articles and
two editorials on the question without, Rubin says, coming to a
conclusion.
   ``The answer is not in yet,'' he said.
   Even without the Vitamin D hypothesis, Rubin says, there's evidence from
twin studies and other population studies that osteoporosis has a
hereditary component.
   But it could simply be that closely-related people tend to have similar
skeletons, according to Anthony Hodsman, a clinician and osteoporosis
researcher at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont.
   On that hypothesis, he said, women with small, fragile bones would tend
to develop osteoporosis more than others and so would their close
relatives. But there would not be a single gene or complex of genes that
caused the condition.
   Rubin said the Vitamin D link may turn out to predict accumulation of
bone mass and density during the early years of a person's life. He is
starting a long-term study of 700 young women at Women's College Hospital
to determine, among other things, their Vitamin D receptor status.
   But predicting bone mass may be of limited use: ``Women even at the same
level of bone density fracture at different rates,'' Rubin said. ``The
issue is the quality of the bone.''

AFTER THOUSAND-YEAR SLEEP, LOTUS SPROUTS CHEMISTRY OF LONGEVITY THEORIES

By:
MB

   Ancient lotus seeds, recovered and germinated after lying dormant for
centuries in a dried-out lake bed in China, are giving scientists new
insights into the biochemistry of longevity.
   ``We're interested in what new things the lotus can teach us about
aging,'' not just in plants but in humans as well, said Steven Clarke, a
University of California at Los Angeles biochemist. Clarke analyzed the
chemical make-up of two of seven ancient seeds given to UCLA scientists by
the Beijing Institute of Botany in the early 1980s. These seeds indicate
that, if everything goes right, the potential for cellular life ``is
probably much longer than we thought,'' Clarke said.
   Jane Shen-Miller, a UCLA plant physiologist coaxed a shoot from a lotus
seed estimated to be 1,288 years old. It had been recovered from Pulantien,
China, which had been a lake where lotus plants were cultivated up to about
1484, when, geological records show, an earthquake drained it.
   This seed may be the oldest ``demonstrably viable and directly dated
seed ever reported, the preserved relic of one of the early crops of lotus
cultivated by Buddhists,'' who hold the lotus as sacred, said Shen-Miller.
Other claims of viable seeds found in the relics of antiquity, including
some from King Tut's tomb, could not be confirmed or were hoaxes.
   ``This sleeping beauty, which was already there when Marco Polo came to
China in the 13th century, must have a powerful genetic system to delay its
aging,'' said Shen-Miller, who published a paper describing the germination
of the seeds in the American Journal of Botany last November. Another
lotus plant was grown from a seed 322 years old.
   Clarke said that he was given two of these seeds -- a 95-year-old one
that was able to germinate and a 416 year-old one that was not. When he
broke through the thick skins, he was amazed by ``how healthy the embryos
looked.'' Clarke and a post-doc then ground up the embryos and assayed them
for repair proteins.
   Upon examining the lotus embryos, Clarke found levels of L-isoaspartyl
methyltransferase (MT), a protein repair enzyme, that were equal to those
found in fresh seeds. This enzyme, found in all tissues and especially in
seeds, plays a role in limiting the accumulation of damaged proteins in
storage and may help plants adapt to environmental stresses, such as
drought.
   His lab was the first to identify MT as an enzyme involved in protein
repair. It fixes proteins by straightening out the ``kink in the
polypeptide chain'' that occurs during a cell damaging chemical process
known as isomerization.
   Clarke is currently conducting experiments in various models, and has so
far knocked out the MT gene in bacteria and worms. He found that the
MT-deficient organisms do not last as long as those with an intact gene.
His lab is moving on to mouse experiments.
   In other research, Clarke is gathering blood and cheek cell samples from
healthy people over age 85. He is looking at the levels and quality of
repair MT in these people, using PCR to find variants in the MT gene, which
is located on chromosome 6.
   ``Do they make it because they have a super efficient variant of this
enzyme?'' he said.
   On the flip side, studies of fibroblasts from victims of progeria, a
disease of abnormally rapid aging, have shown no difference in MT levels.
   Although MT appears to be an important contributor to longevity, Clarke
points out that the enzyme is most likely just one of many of the lotus
seeds' life-preservers.
   ``These seeds survived because everything went right,'' said Clarke.
   The tough outer skin that provides an air- and water-tight chamber for
the embryos was one important element in their survival, wrote Shen-Miller.
The scientists also found high levels of ascorbic acid and glutathione, two
agents that are effective in maintaining functioning proteins.
   Clarke anticipates that scientists are going to identify many more
repair enzymes.
   ``What we may find is that our repair kits are a lot more effective than
we thought,'' said Clarke, whose lab is looking at protective strategies in
several different kinds of plants. Clarke hopes that further study of the
lotus, which has been used for thousands of years in Chinese pharmacopoeia,
may reveal other secrets of its longevity, including some of the other
enzymes that repair damaged proteins.

RESEARCHERS FIND GROWTH HORMONE A DRY HOLE IN SEARCH FOR FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH

By:
By Mike Pezzella

   A decade ago genetic engineering made human growth hormone available in
large quantities and opened a floodgate of claims that the Fountain of
Youth was about to flow into the world.
   While recombinant human growth hormone, rhGH, has helped some children
with growth problems -- at a price of $10,000 to $30,000 a year -- it
hasn't banished wrinkles or the decrease in muscle protein mass, strength
and bone mineral density that shows up in the decades after 60.
   ``If you take growth hormone, maybe it makes you look younger, but
you're gaining fluid. You're filling in the wrinkles, you fill them up with
fluid,'' said Dr. Kevin E. Yarasheski, of the Metabolism Division and
Section of Applied Physiology at Washington University School of Medicine,
St. Louis, Mo.
   Yarasheski and his colleagues at Washington, Jeffrey J. Zachwieja, Jill
A. Campbell and Dennis M. Bier, studied the effect of growth hormone in
older men.
   The 23 men ranging in age from 64 to 75 followed a 16-week program of
resistance exercise that went from moderate to high intensity in
combination with administration of growth hormone or a placebo. The purpose
was to see if growth hormone (GH) treatment would result in a greater
increase in muscle strength, whole body and skeletal muscle protein
synthesis rate, or a greater reduction in fat mass and myofibrilar protein
breakdown rate in older men than an identical training program without GH.
   Instead of the fountain of youth, Yarasheski and his team found a pool
of fluid. During the study GH treatment was cut off to several of the
participants who developed symptoms of carpal tunnel compression and fluid
retention in hands and feet. Eight of the 13 GH recipients were able to
complete the 16-week course of the study.
   ``We found that GH produces no gain in strength or muscle mass without
exercise,'' said Yarasheski.
   The result in the study of older men duplicated results Yarasheski got
in a similar 1992 study of young men. Then, Yarasheski monitored 18 men
ranging in age from 21 to 34. They were followed on a 12-week course of
heavy resistance exercise training using Nautilus equipment.
   ``No one has ever measured fluid retention in past studies that show
weight or mass gain in growth hormone use. People might link greater body
mass and lack of wrinkles with youth. So when they retain fluid and put on
extra weight they associate that with the feeling of well-being they had
when they were younger,'' said Yarasheski.
   ``What they are doing probably is filling in the wrinkles with fluid,
they are not getting rid of the effects of aging,'' said Yarasheski.
   He did admit that the ``filling in'' of wrinkles can produce at least a
short-term change in appearance that might make someone sensitive to aging
feel better. But when it came to discussing muscle building, Yarasheski was
definite: ``Lean tissue? No, it is fluid retention.''
   ``We used the Genentech hormone, it's just about the same as the Lilly
hormone,'' said Yarasheski.
   Yarasheski is currently completing a third growth hormone study
involving women as well as men. This time the subjects are not being made
to exercise because the researcher said he is beginning to think that GH
``doesn't add anything'' to the subjects.
   ``Exercise is so powerful, that it creates an effect that either
overshadows the effect of growth hormone or it creates the entire
beneficial effect itself,'' said Yarasheski.
   The current study involves more than 30 individuals including eight or
nine women. He said the Washington University team has found that women
respond to growth hormone ``pretty much the same as men,'' in previous
studies.
   There has been no gain in strength or muscle mass without exercise.
   Yarasheski said that he is puzzled by why growth hormone treatment does
not produce a marked effect.
   He said that it may be that scientists have not yet learned how to set
the proper dosage for the hormone. He also speculated that exercise may
produce such a powerful effect on the body that it cancels out everything
else when it is in use. He also said that scientists have theorized that
as yet unknown individual characteristics may decide who will respond to
the hormone or that the hormone is a short-term drug against which the body
develops an immunity. That would explain why young subjects respond to GH
therapy and why adults and older people apparently do not.
   Yarasheski is currently writing the paper on his latest GH study and
expects to have the results about the use of the drug on women and men who
did not exercise ready to publish by the end of 1996.
   In the meantime the hormone treatment is being marketed by mail-order
from the Bahamas via slick magazine ads from Palm Springs as a way to
extend life, increase bone and lean muscle mass and improve cardiac
function.
   If nothing else, Yarasheski said, the fluid retention can make people
feel better about themselves because they may look more like they did when
they were young. What the scientist called a kind of mirror therapy.
   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Genentech, maker of the hormone used by
Yarasheski, said the company was doing no work on use of their product in
the aging.
   ``We work very closely with Genentech, but we are not giving them the
answers they want,'' said Yarasheski. ``But those are the answers we are
getting.''

MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH TO TAKE NEW DIRECTION IN '96

By:
RR

   Last year, two clinical trials of biotech drugs to prevent age-related
macular degeneration ended with negative results. But others may begin
with different drugs within the next 18 months, according to the study
chairman of an international macular degeneration study group.
   Age-related macular degeneration, which progressively leads to
blindness, affects approximately 600,000 Americans each year. The
condition is characterized by a loss of sight due to functional
degeneration of light-sensitive, retinal nerve cells at the back of the eye
that distinguish fine detail at the center of a person's field of vision. 
The less common ``wet'' type of the disease, involving abnormal
blood-vessel growth, quickly leads to blindness, compared to the more
common ``dry'' form, which has a much slower onset but sometimes converts
to the ``wet'' disease.
   In April, Celtrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., announced
the cancellation of its macular degeneration program when interim data from
a Phase II trial found no significant effect from its transforming growth
factor (TGF) beta-2 product, BetaKine (see BTNW, May 17, '93, p. 10). In
fact, the pullout resulted in a subsequent restructuring of the company --
and the departure of Celtrix's original President and Chief Executive
Officer (CEO), Dale Stringfellow, who now works at Berlex Laboratories on
unrelated projects.
   Celtrix's new President/CEO, Andreas Sommer, said work with BetaKine
will probably continue on a substantially different ophthalmologic disease:
macular holes.
   ``There is a fairly good rationale'' for using the tissue-repair
capability of the drug there, Sommer said. ``It appears that TGF-beta has
some repair activity on this hole. In macular degeneration there is no
such thing.'' He said macular degeneration is a ``very complex process
that is unrelated to tissue repair.''
   In November, the Pharmacological Therapy for Macular Degeneration Study
Group (PTMDSG), comprising 53 centers worldwide, ended a placebo-controlled
trial, involving 53 centers worldwide, of Hoffmann-La Roche's interferon
alpha-2a (Roferon-A) in 500 elderly patients with the ``wet'' form of
macular degeneration.
   PTMDSG study chairman David Guyer, who runs the retinal program at the
Manhattan Eye, Nose and Throat Hospital in New York City and is a clinical
associate professor at Cornell, said ``it's going to be a negative study''
when the results are put together and reported in the literature.
   Interferon was ``shown in the test tube to stop abnormal blood vessels
from growing,'' he said, ``and it works for vascular tumors in humans to
cause regression of blood vessels, so there was strong, scientific
rationale'' for the trial. However, he said, ``it may have just been that
not enough drug penetrated'' the retina to make a significant difference. 
``It's very hard to know why it didn't work.''
   However, Guyer said, ``there are future studies with other companies
that haven't been announced.'' Within the next 18 months, he said, ``I'd
expect one and maybe two major studies on synthetic drugs, potentially, to
be started. We should know in the next two months or so if they will be
funded or not.''
   Guyer said ``there are two good candidates,'' and perhaps ``three or
four others, depending on further testing,'' to go into new clinical trials
for age-related macular degeneration. One -- a new biotech drug that he
would not name -- is an ``extremely good candidate,'' he said. But the
company that developed and owns it must first ``agree on an expensive
program to go forth on it,'' he said. The company must ``first agree that
they're going to increase production, do all the safety studies, etc., etc.
So it's a huge cost to them. My feeling is, I think they're going to go
with this one.''
   ``We should hopefully know within the next four to eight weeks'' whether
or not it will proceed, Guyer said.

ON THE TRAIL OF APO E GENE IN THE BRAIN, LOOKING FOR ALZHEIMER ORIGINS

By:
By Marjorie Shaffer

   Like detectives gathering evidence at the scene of a crime, researchers
are tracking the footprints of the polymorphic apo E gene in the brain,
hoping to find the mechanisms that lead to the destruction of neurons, the
tangles and the plaques peppering the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
   The search is yielding tantalizing clues to the origins of the most
common cause of dementia in the elderly, and may one day provide a way to
actually prevent or slow a disease that is said to be the fourth-leading
cause of death in the United States. Some four million Americans have
Alzheimer's, and the disease kills 100,000 people annually. It typically
strikes after the age of 65.
   The research is also providing a possible window into other kinds of
dementia associated with AIDS and the loss of memory associated with
aging. Although much of this research is still in its infancy, the efforts
being made to understand Alzheimer's will undoubtedly help unlock the
mysteries of other diseases that tear the tissues of reality and memory.
   And, perhaps most importantly, the research reveals that Alzheimer's and
other neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging, are not caused by
one factor like a bacteria or a virus, but are a result of multiple factors
that produce multiple forms of a syndrome.
   ``Aging isn't the explanation for the loss of memory. Instead, memory
loss is a biological mechanism, perhaps a disease process, that we need to
understand,'' said Zaven Khachaturian, the longtime director of Alzheimer's
disease research at the National Institute on Aging, who is now an
independent consultant in Bethesda, Md.
   ``We don't know of a way to prevent any of the dementias and I don't
find it useful to categorize the dementias into different forms,'' said
Khachaturian. ``It is a generic problem that in all cases involves a loss
of neurons in a particular part of the brain. The solution is to find a way
to slow down the process in Alzheimer's, and once we find that we could
apply it to other diseases. We need to attack the fundamental process to
insure that neurons remain functioning for a lifetime,'' he said.
   In healthy individuals, overall, there are some changes that occur when
the brain ages, although the evidence is still murky, according to Barry
Gordon, director of the department of cognitive neurology at Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine. The hippocampus, for example, an important
area linked to learning and memory, may become less effective, and there
may be a loss of neurons in the cortex, said Gordon.
   ``But this is a very controversial topic. The old saw about losing
10,000 brain cells a day in the cortex is simply wrong. It is very tough to
count brain regions, and we don't lose nearly as many neurons in the cortex
as people once thought.
   ``The most universal phenomenon of age is slowing,'' said Gordon. ``When
we age we don't necessarily lose our memory, we slow down, our thought
processes take longer.''
   In contrast, the dementia associated with Alzheimer's is far more
profound. It affects not just memory, but language, concentration and many
other aspects of ``cognition.''
   Researchers are taking a variety of approaches to attacking the
Alzheimer's disease process, but most are in some way linked to the apo E
polymorphism. In one of the latest research advances, a team led by Judes
Poirier at McGill University found that Alzheimer's patients who didn't
carry the apo E4 allele, the so-called ``bad'' form of the protein,
responded dramatically to Cognex, a medication that increases the amount of
the nerve messenger acetylcholine in the brain. Neurons producing the
brain chemical degenerate in Alzheimer's patients and the chemical is
crucial to learning and memory.
   Another retrospective study by Martin Farlow at the University of
Indiana found the same correlation between the apo E genotype and the
response to Cognex.
   ``Dr. Poirier's observation is exciting but extremely preliminary,''
said Norman Relkin, director of the memory disorders program at Cornell
University Medical Center. ``It needs to be replicated by other groups and
has to be tested in a prospective fashion,'' he said.
   The exact role of apo E itself is still not understood, but the protein
is made mainly in the liver and it shuttles cholesterol among the body's
cells. It is also produced in the brain, and there it has been linked to
regeneration and repair of neurons, among other possible roles. Recently,
for example, Allen Roses' group at Duke University found the protein in the
post-mortem brain tissues of normal, non-demented individuals as well as in
the tissues of Alzheimer's patients. Apo E has also been found in the
amyloid plaques of the disease, and the protein has been implicated in the
formation of tangles in the brain that are composed of a mutated form of a
common protein called tau.
   Two years ago the Duke University group reported a link between apo E
and Alzheimer's disease and since then many studies have verified the
original finding. The three forms of apo E, 2, 3, and 4, are now linked to
different probabilities of getting the disease: in the worst case two doses
of apo E4 are associated with the highest risk. Yet the picture is
complicated. Because there are three alleles of the same gene, there are
six possible combinations of apo E, and form number 2 may even protect
against the disease. Furthermore, some 10% of individuals with two doses of
apo E4 will not get the disease.
   Some experts estimate that roughly 40% to 60% of Alzheimer's disease
patients are apo E4 carriers; and about 80% of the general population may
carry at least one dose of E3. But tests for apo E are only recommended
as an additional piece of information for individuals who are already
experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer's, according to Neil Buckholtz, acting
associate director for neuroscience and neuropsychology at the National
Institute of Aging. ``This whole issue of apo E isn't clear yet at all,''
said Buckholtz. ``Large-scale epidemiologic studies need to be done, and
testing isn't recommended for people who don't have symptoms,'' he said.
``Apo E4 interacts with tau protein and AB protein in plaques and a
tremendous amount of research is now being done to either block apo E4 or
mimic apo E2.''
   Other groups are devising ways to prevent the deposition of the small
protein called AB peptide that is the main component of the amyloid plaques
of Alzheimer's. And still other groups are testing new compounds that
increase the production of acetylcholine or corticotropin releasing factor
in the brain, or regulate calcium in neurons.
   Possibly a definitive treatment for Alzheimer's may require several
approaches, mirroring the disease itself, according to Gordon of Johns
Hopkins. ``It is likely that what we call aging is a whole series of
problems. If you own a car, as it ages a lot of things go wrong,'' he
said.

REACHING 100: IS IT TORTOISE MEAT, MARTINIS OR GENES?

By:
By Mara Bovsun

   What's the secret of long life?
   Ask any centenarian and you'll hear a lot about sturdy ancestors,
healthy habits and an upbeat attitude. One 114-year-old African woman
reportedly attributes her age to a diet of pumpkin seeds, locusts and
tortoise meat. Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, the world's oldest human being
at over 120, advises people to ``Always keep your smile.'' Broadway legend
George Abbott who died last year at 107, said his secret was: ``Have fun,
and go home when you're tired.''
   Then there's 99-year-old comic George Burns whose longevity prescription
includes 10 to 20 cigars and three to four martinis a day, along with a
passion for his work.
   ``And I don't eat spinach,'' he told Larry King in an interview last
July.
   While gerontologists try to find some pattern in the daily habits of the
oldest old -- people who were born in the last century -- biochemists armed
with the new tools of molecular biology are looking for chemical and
genetic bases of long, long lives.
   What they've found so far appears to be the molecular equivalent of
tortoise meat and martinis.
   ``What we don't know is really overwhelming,'' said molecular biologist
David B. Finkelstein, director of the pathobiology program at the National
Institute on Aging (NIA), which devotes roughly $450 million annually to
the study of growing old, from neurological degeneration to genetics. Of
that total, up to $60 million goes to the program on the biology of aging,
focusing on the cellular and genetic mechanisms that lead to signs of
physical old age -- compromised immune systems, wrinkles, blindness, muscle
loss, bone thinning and dementia.
   Although modern theories of aging go back at least 30 years, when
Leonard Hayflick posed his idea that the lives of cells are measured by a
molecular clock, Finkelstein said there's a need for much more research --
and new researchers -- before any of the current concepts can be proven.
   ``At this point we know, the one thing we know for sure, no doubt, is if
you calorically restrict an animal, it will live longer and be healthier,''
said Finkelstein. In flies and rodents, cutting food intake by 30 percent
extended life. Studies in primates are just getting underway, led by
researchers at the University of Wisconsin and at the Gerontology Research
Center in Baltimore. Finkelstein said that the hope of researchers is to
find out what kinds of physical reactions are triggered by caloric
restriction, so that scientists might be able to replicate them.
   The goal of these scientific inquiries, say scientists, is not simply to
extend life span, but to delay for as long as possible the onset of disease
and disability. In 1992, diseases afflicting Americans over the age 65
accounted for nearly 38 percent of the national health care bill of $800
billion, according to a report by the American Federation for Aging
Research (AFAR) and the Alliance for Aging Research.
   ``If the option is to have everyone live to 120, and the last ten years
of their life to be in a wheelchair, with Alzheimer's and immobilized, who
wants it?'' said Dr. Finkelstein.
   In this century, improved nutrition, sanitation and medical care raised
the average life expectancy from 49 years to 76 years. By the year 2,000,
that life expectancy will be about 85 years and more and more people seem
to be hitting the century mark. In 1970, the U.S. census counted only about
3,300 people who had made it to 100. By 1990, there were more than 35,000
centenarians
   But there is a vast difference in their health and how they live. Some
are so vital that they continue to work and even participate in sports,
such as one 100-year-old swimmer who competes in the backstroke in the
Senior Olympics. Others are simply holding on to life, confined to
wheelchairs and nursing homes.
   One important question that must be answered is ``what is normal aging
and what is pathological?'' said Finkelstein. Studies -- such as the
Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) at the Gerontology Research
Center in Baltimore -- are trying to establish benchmarks for what can be
considered normal in healthy old people. BLSA has about 1,100 active
participants, said Finkelstein, who come in every year or two for a battery
of tests.
   The NIA is planning to start a study of the ``oldest of the old,''
establishing a cell bank of those unusual people who reach 100. 
Finkelstein said that it will most likely get started in the next few
years, after the agency has determined how to handle the ethical issues
involved with collecting samples and obtaining informed consent. In France,
scientists at the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine have established
a cell bank of their oldest citizens and are already looking for genes that
are common to them.
   Finkelstein said that the NIA is funding several lines of research in
the genetics of aging. A lot of backing is going into investigations into
genes that produce super oxide dismutase (SOD), a mechanism that protects
cells against oxidative damage.
   Another hot area is advanced glycosylation, a process of binding
proteins and glucose molecules, he said. ``This has been a very eclectic
area until people discovered receptors that can identify these advanced
glycosylation products,'' said Finkelstein. Glycosylation may be related to
heart disease, and researchers have compounds to reverse this process in
clinical trials. Other NIA-funded research has found several genes
connected with longevity in C. elegans, a microscopic worm, and yeast.
   The theory of the telomere clock has aroused considerable excitement in
recent years, both for its relationship to aging and its impact on cancer.
Telomeres are DNA repeats -- TTAGGG -- at the tail end of chromosomes. Each
time cells divide, the strands become shorter, until the cells reach a
stage when they enter senescence and are no longer dividing. Research
indicates that such cells accumulate, producing substances that result in
the breakdown of healthy tissues.
   Geron Corp., a biotechnology company in Menlo Park, Calif., has been
conducting research for several years into the role of telomeres in aging
as well as the role of an enzyme, called telomerase, in the process of
immortalizing cells, which turns them cancerous.
   In a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, Geron researchers reported that telomere length can be used as a
marker for human vascular aging, implying that the accumulation of
senescent endothelial cells may contribute to clogging of the arteries and
blood clotting.
   According to Geron's Calvin B. Harley, the research is the ``first
evidence utilizing the techniques of telomere biology to suggest that the
aging of vascular cells contributes to atherosclerosis and possibly other
cardiovascular diseases.'' Measuring telomere length might be a useful
method of predicting the onset of atherosclerosis.
   The impact of these senescent cells on the body is key area of
investigation, said Finkelstein.
   ``We know cells become senescent in vitro. We only have recent evidence
that they become senescent in vivo as well.''
   Rather than simply lying dormant, these non-replicating cells exude
substances that damage surrounding cells and cause age-related problems.
   Judith Campisi, a senior scientist at Berkeley National Laboratory, is
one member of a scientific team that developed a simple, rapid test for
senescent cells, and the accumulation of these cells, in living organisms.
The assay measures levels of the enzyme beta-galactosidase (BG), which is
produced by senescent cells. Until now, the only way to study cell
senescence was to culture cells until they stopped replicating.
   This fast, inexpensive assay allows researchers to find senescent cells 
by determining whether the enzymatic marker is present.
   Specific cell types have their own markers indicating senescence, said
Campisi. In skin cells, for example, an enzymatic marker is the
over-production of collagenase, an enzyme that breaks down collagen,
causing the skin to collapse. Wrinkled skin is one result of this
mechanism, she said.
   Scientists are exploring strategies to reverse the properties of
senescent cells responsible for age-related destruction, without igniting
the cell's replicative powers. If that were to happen, the result could be
uncontrolled cell growth -- cancer.
   ``The idea of balance has to be taken quite seriously,'' she said.
   Geron is working in this area, and has licensed the BG test for use in
its program to find drugs to modulate the phenotype of senescent cells.
   Premature aging conditions -- such as progeria -- are also offering a
glimpse into the biology of longevity. These rare syndromes may be caused
by a defect in a single gene, making them easier to study than normal
aging, which is most likely controlled by a complex of genes.
   Genetics of aging expert George M. Martin has established a registry of
people suffering from Werner syndrome, an autosomal recessive disease that
causes 20-year-olds to develop age-related ailments such as premature
balding, osteoporosis, heart disease and diabetes. The gene for this
syndrome has been tracked to chromosome 8, and scientists believe they are
closing in on it. Martin, professor of pathology, adjunct professor of
genetics and director, Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of
Washington, Seattle, is also investigating the genetic basis for
susceptibility and resistance to Alzheimer-type dementia as well as looking
at the somatic mutations that break down cells.
   Overall, researchers in aging seem to be traveling down two paths --
those exploring aging as an accumulation of cellular insults -- such as
oxidative damage -- and those seeking inborn mechanisms that pre-set
cellular life-span, said T. Franklin Williams, scientific director of AFAR,
which has devoted about $13 million over the past 14 years to scientists in
the field and has earmarked another $20 million to support scientists over
the next five years.
   Most likely, he said, a person's life span will be determined by a
combination of genetic programming and cell damage.
   ``We all have a mix of factors that will eventually do us in,'' said
Williams. ``It is a very individual matter as to what the ultimate life
span will be.''
   For now the outer limit for the life of one human being appears to be
around 110, with few, like Jeanne Calment, stretching it, to the
bewilderment of scientists, for up to a decade more.

ARTHRITIS RESEARCH: DRUG COMPANIES FOCUS MOSTLY ON RHEUMATOID

By:
By Reginald Rhein

   The two major forms of arthritis -- rheumatoid and osteoarthritis --
both are inflammatory diseases of the joints. But they are very different
diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, can strike at
any age; it most commonly affects the joints of the hand, wrist, elbows and
shoulders. Osteoarthritis (OA), considered a disease of aging, attacks
only the cartilage, and most often causes disability in the knees, hips,
and spine.
   Many companies are trying to develop drugs against RA, but only a few
are specifically tackling OA, even though the potential market is more than
six times as large (16 million Americans have OA vs. 2.5 million with RA). 
Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been
the first line of therapy for both conditions since the beginning of the
century, and most clinical trials still involve NSAIDs. The Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) lists 20 companies with drugs
in clinical trials against RA and seven for OA, with five of the drugs in
trials for OA also in RA trials.
   Part of the lack of interest by biotechnology companies in OA was that,
until very recently, OA was considered the result of ``wear and tear'' of
aging joints, while RA -- caused by the body's immune system attacking the
synovium, or joint lining -- was considered potentially more amenable to
intervention with biotech drugs. Thus, clinical trials with monoclonal
antibodies or other drugs have attempted to block RA's autoimmune cascade,
which starts with the release of interleukin-1 (IL-1) by macrophages, and
continues when the IL-1 and other stimulatory factors ``dock'' to the
receptor molecules on other immune cells -- or on cartilage or bone cells
-- and trigger the release of enzymes that ultimately destroy the synovium
membrane. No similar therapeutic targets were thought to exist for OA.
   ``Osteoarthritis is a problem of articular cartilage, which is the
gliding surface of the joint,'' said Steven Trippel, professor of
orthopedic surgery at Harvard University and Massachusetts General
Hospital. ``The difficulty of that disease -- at least viewed from one
perspective -- is that the homeostasis, which is the balance between
degradation and repair, is lost.
   ``In normal tissue, in almost every tissue in the body, there is some
turnover of the tissue occurring,'' Trippel said. ``That's true in
articular cartilage as well. And the matrix, the material that is the
rubbery, very slippery gliding surface that allows the joint to function
properly in a normal joint, is slowly turning over. That means that you
could view osteoarthritis as the failure of the balance between repair and
degradation of this matrix.''
   Trippel suggested that biotechnology could be used to inhibit the loss
of the matrix. ``One way of doing that would be to use gene therapy,'' he
said. ``Another way would be to use medication or already-fabricated gene
product that could be put into the joint or delivered to the body in some
other way. But the principle would still be the same; that is, to try to
inhibit the loss of matrix which characterizes the disease.''
   The second approach, Trippel said, is to ``increase the repair side of
the homeostasis equation.'' For this, growth factors could be sought that
act on articular cartilage to enhance repair -- and perhaps slow down or
even reverse the process of osteoarthritis. ``That would be really
exciting,'' he said.
   ``There is work going on in this area, trying to understand the effect
of growth factors on articular cartilage,'' Trippel said. ``But to my
knowledge there is no good experiment out there that shows, definitely in
an animal model, for example, that if you give a single growth factor that
you can correct the disease.''
   Several OA studies in animals are currently underway, however, including
a gene-transfer study in rabbits, which is being undertaken by Christopher
Evans, associate professor of orthopedic surgery and molecular genetics and
biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
   ``The OA work is part of a larger program where we're trying to use gene
transfer techniques to address a number of joint diseases, including both
rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, as well as to enhance the repair of joints
following injury,'' Evans said. His group has focused on the synovium
articular cartilage, meniscus and ligaments, he said. ``In the context of
OA, I guess, the key one is the articular cartilage,'' Evans said. ``We're
in the process of transferring various genes, both marker genes and
potentially helpful genes, into the articular cartilage of rabbits.''
   Evans said he has ``toyed with the idea'' of transferring
metalloprotease inhibitors to rabbit joints, since metalloprotease is
specifically associated with OA, but ``we've not given that a priority.'' 
Most of the group's early work was in RA, where anti-inflammatory genes
were put into synovium. ``Just in the past couple of years we've expanded
into OA,'' he said.
   For Trippel, the ``best'' and ``most encouraging'' animal study he has
seen is one by Richard Rogachefsky and his colleagues at the University of
Miami School of Medicine and the University of Texas Health Science Center
at San Antonio. ``That group showed that if you gave a particular growth
factor called insulin-like growth factor 1, IGF-1, with an additional
molecule that influences the effect of IGF-1, you could actually help
prevent osteoarthritis in a canine model,'' said Trippel. The study,
published in the Journal of the Osteoarthritis Research Society --
Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (Vol. 1, 105-114, 1993) -- found ``in a model
of mild OA, therapeutic intervention with IGF-1 and PPS [sodium pentosan
polysulfate] appeared to successfully maintain cartilage structure and
biochemistry.''
   For Brian Butcher, group vice president for research at the Arthritis
Foundation in Atlanta, Ga., ``probably the most exciting thing that's
happened in the past few years'' in OA has been the discovery by Darwin
Prockop, who directs the Jefferson Institute of Molecular Medicine at the
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, of a gene associated with
osteoarthritis. About three years ago, Prockop isolated a point mutation
in a type II collagen gene in members of a family prone to developing
early-onset OA. All those with the disease had the mutant gene, while all
those without the gene did not have OA. Prockop said he has now scanned
about 40 other families and found the gene in about 3 percent of OA
patients. He estimated that about 10 genes are involved in making the
proteins responsible for strong cartilage.
   Prockop said he is currently participating in a gene therapy trial of a
related disease, osteogenic imperfecta (OI), at St. Jude's Hospital for
Children in Memphis. He wants to successfully complete this trial before
attempting to correct the genetic defect in OA patients, since OI is a far
more serious affliction than OA. In the OI trial, bone-marrow cells will be
removed from the patients, normal genes will be inserted ex vivo, and the
cells will be replaced in the patients' cartilage, Prockop said.

OSTEOPOROSIS COLLABORATION FOR CHUGAI, LILLY

   Eli Lilly Japan K.K. -- wholly owned Japanese subsidiary of Eli Lilly
and Co. (U.S.) -- and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. (Japan) have reached
agreement on the joint development and marketing of raloxifene
anti-osteoporosis agent for which Eli Lilly is conducting clinical testing
in the West and Japan.
   The deal was announced at a press conference in of the presidents of
both companies held December 13 in Kobe. According to the announcement,
raloxifene is a new-type anti-osteoporosis agent claimed not to have the
side effects conventional equivalents have. It is now in phase-II clinical
testing in Japan and manufacturing approval will be sought in three to four
years.
   Raloxifene, dubbed a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM), acts
against osteoporosis during and after climacterium by stimulating bone
metabolism and fatty metabolism in the same way that the female hormone
estrogen does, but is free from the side effects of causing cancer of the
breast and uterus, which estrogen is suspected of inducing, the
announcement said. It is said that in Japan there are roughly 2 million
patients afflicted with osteoporosis as well as 5 million persons likely to
be afflicted, offering a market of about $1.1 billion in fiscal 1994,
   President O. Nagayama of Chugai said the two firms will soon form a
team to promote clinical development of the new drug in Japan. They will
also consider linking up with each other for therapies for other bone
diseases. Commenting on the collaboration with Chugai.
   President B.D. Carmine of Eli Lilly Japan said that faster development
of the new drug will be possible as the company will obtain information
from Chugai regarding Japanese market trends.
   Nagayama said Chugai has invested specifically in the bone-related field
and he was pleased that Eli Lilly understood this policy of Chugai's and
had decided to cooperate to push the development and marketing of the drug
in Japan.

LIVER CANCER REDUCED THROUGH IFN TREATMENT

   The onset of liver cancer appears to be reduced by more than one third
through interferon (IFN) treatment of hepatitis, said Masao Omata,
professor of Internal Medicine II, Faculty of Medicine, University of
Tokyo.
   He stressed the necessity of treatment aimed at eradication of
hepatocellular carcinoma from the hepatitis treatment stage. Omata said
that at present hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 83% of patients with
hepatitis C and 11% of those with hepatitis B.
   Based on comparative data between patients with hepatitis treated or not
treated with IFN, hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in 2,200 patients per
100,000 of the population in the untreated group. But in the treated group,
this figure is reduced to 600 patients. This indicates that IFN treatment
of hepatitis inhibits the onset of the cancer.
   The 5-year survival rate for 500 patients treated for hepatocellular
carcinoma over the past 3 and a half years was 35%.

REOPRO CLINICAL RESULTS ARE TRIAL STOPPERS

   Centocor, Inc. has halted two clinical trials of ReoPro, its
anti-platelet indicated for the reduction of acute cardiac ischemic
complications in patients undergoing angioplasty, because of the strong
positive results of its testing, officials said last month.
   In addition to getting more good news on the drug's effects on patients
undergoing angioplasty procedures in a clinical in mid-December,
researchers found only days later that it showed dramatic benefits in cases
of unstable angina.
   Centocor's stock price, as a direct result of the news, jumped some 75%
in the third week of December and was trading around 30 as BTNW went to
press last week.
   Pharmaceutical industry analysts said the strong clinical trial results
for unstable angina patients could more than double the potential market
for ReoPro by making it a treatment for everyone seeking help for chest
pains, in addition to its use for those receiving angioplasty.

PYRILINKS BONE METABOLISM TEST RESULTS

   Pyrilinks and Pyrilinks-D assays measure bone resorption with greater
specificity than assays that measure other tissue collagen metabolites,
including an assay for N-telopeptides, according to officials at Metra
Biosystems, Inc. who were citing data in Acta Orthopaedica Scandanavica.
   Metra's assays measure the pyridinium crosslinks of collagen,
pyridinoline (Pyd) and deoxypyridinoline (Dpd). This in vitro study
reported a positive reaction of an N-telopeptides assay with skin collagen,
indicating that the assay reacts generally with other type I collagen

production of human platelet factor-4 (PF4), modified forms of PF-4 such as
MPF-4 and CPF-4, and precursor polypeptides of PF-4, MPF-4 and CPF-4. The
precursor polypeptides have the formula X-PF-4, X-MPF-4, or X-CPF-4 wherein
X is a cleavable peptide leader sequence. The cleavable peptide leader
sequence is preferably Met-Arg or Met-Arg-Met. The precursor polypeptides
can be optionally cleaved to remove the cleavable peptide leader sequence
to form biologically active native compounds or can be used without
cleavage in methods to inhibit angiogenesis.

A method is provided for multiplying the number of copies of a target
polynucleotide sequence comprising a series of primer hybridization,
extending, and denaturing steps to provide an intermediate double-stranded
DNA molecule containing a promoter sequence (through the use of a
promoter-sequence-containing primer) incorporated upstream from the target
sequence. The double-stranded DNA intermediate is then used to grow
multiple RNA copies of the target sequence. The resulting RNA copies can be
used as target sequences to produce further copies. Multiple cycles of this
sort can thereby exponentially increase the number of target sequence
copies.

A method of amplifying a specified nucleic acid sequence, which permits an
amplification reduced in nonspecific hybridization and increased in
specificity. The invention also provides a reagent which does not suffer
any activity drop during supply and preservation thereof and is highly
stable. Thermostable enzymes are used as the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase,
DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and ribonuclease
H, all of which are necessary for the replicative RNA-base amplification
system. It is desirable to use combinedly a thermostable DNA-dependent RNA
polymerase and a thermostable enzyme originating in Thermus thermophilus
which comprises all of the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, DNA-dependent DNA
polymerase and ribonuclease H. The use of the thermostable enzymes
according to the above method serves to prevent the enzymes from being
deactivated and enables the amplification without the necessity for
sequentially adding the enzymes.

'We Can Continue to Launch New Products to Raise Our Position':
Mr. Rubens of Zeneca Yakuhin


   "We have developed and are developing innovative products
which are adapted to the Japanese market.  Having a good product
pipeline towards the year 2000, we can continue to launch novel
products one after another from this year (1996).  Therefore, we
hope we can raise our market share in Japan around the year
2000," said Mr. Robert Rubens, president of Zeneca Yakuhin in a
recent interview with PHARMA JAPAN.
   Zeneca Yakuhin reached sales of 62.5 billion yen on an NHI
price basis for the financial year ending December 1994, with a
market share of approximately 1%.  The company ranked 31st among
all pharmaceutical manufacturers in Japan and 9th among foreign-
affiliated firms in 1994.
   As of the end of the third quarter of 1995, Zeneca Yakuhin
attained sales of 47 billion yen on the NHI price basis.
   Terminating a sales consignment agreement with Sumitomo
Pharmaceuticals, Zeneca Yakuhin started an independent
distribution system after the completion of an distribution
center in Toyonaka, Osaka Prefecture in January 1995.
   "Thanks to a lot of help from Sumitomo and appropriate
preparations for the self-distribution made with Sumitomo,
transferring to the independent distribution system went well,"
said Mr. Rubens.
   He went on to say, "We get a high estimation from medical
institutions through our wholesalers because we can have direct
contact with wholesalers.  The experience we have accumulated in
collaboration with Sumitomo is very helpful in building up the
good relationships between us and our wholesalers, and between
medical facilities and us."
   Currently Zeneca has approximately 60 pharmaceutical
wholesalers as distributors for Zeneca products.
   The Ministry of Health and Welfare and the pharmaceutical
industry are now deliberating an MR qualification (or
certification) system.  It is said that the MR qualification
system will be introduced next year.
   Mr. Rubens told that Zeneca has already established an
intensive special training system to improve individual MRs'
knowledge about Zeneca, its products, and the medical and
pharmaceutical sciences, in addition to an ordinary MR training
program.  He added, "Since such training for products are
conducted by therapeutic category such as oncology,
cardiovasculars and anesthesiology, the responses from medical
institutions to our MRs are very good."
   Mr. Rubens added, "We've already prepared for implementation
of the forthcoming MR qualification system."
   He stressed that the role of MRs will be of increasing
importance under the current circumstances where more attention
is paid to the proper use of drugs, patient information on
drugs, and safety information.
   Looking at the recent regulatory activities, we can see that
the Ministry of Health and Welfare established three study
committees on measures to ensure drug safety and on the measures
to promote appropriate use of drugs and on reviewing package
inserts, and another study committee has already released the
findings of a study on informed consent.
   As he mentioned earlier, he is confident that Zeneca's market
share will expand more than expected around the year 2000
because it has a promising pipeline as mentioned below.
   NDAs have already been filed for Zoladex (goserelin acetate),
an LHRH analogue for gynecological disorders such as
endometriosis and myoma of the uterus, and Casodex, an oral
anti-androgen for prostate cancer, in addition to the launch in
early December 1995 of Diprivan (propofol), an IV anesthetic for
induction and maintenance of anesthesia.
   Seroquel, a dopamine and serotonin antagonist for
schizophrenia, Accolate, an oral leukotriene antagonist for
asthma, and Arimidex, an aromatase inhibitor for breast cancer,
are in Phase II.
   Tomudex, a thymidylate synthase inhibitor for colo-rectal
cancer is in Phase I.
   Mr. Rubens expects that these products will be mainstays of
the company in the near future because the oncological,
anesthetic, and asthmatic fields are growing therapeutic ones.
   Touching on the NHI price recalculation and generic listing
problems on which Chuikyo (the Central Social Insurance Medical
Council) made a recommendation on November 22, 1995, he
regretted that the Chuikyo discussions centered not on the real
value of drugs but on the cost of drugs, and that
representatives from the pharmaceutical industry were not
allowed to participate in the discussions as regular partners.
   He emphasized that the disadvantages brought about by the new
repricing rule for already-listed drugs based on the
recommendation may impair the research and development of
innovative drugs in the future.  In addition, they may deprive
patients of their benefits despite the fact that a decision was
recently made on increasing premiums for innovative new drugs.
   "However," Mr. Rubens said, "we wish to continue to carry out
our mission to produce valuable drugs and supply patients with
them."
   From November 30 through December 1, ICH-3 was held in
Yokohama, where progress was made in international harmonization
of regulatory requirements.
   Mr. Rubens said that ICH-3 has apparently born fruit and that
will be especially favorable to multinational pharmaceutical
manufacturers in reducing the duplication of dossiers for NDAs
and eliminating a waste of time and cost.  "The success of ICH-3
will enable us to easier develop innovative new drugs in three
regions -- Europe, the US, and Japan -- simultaneously," he
said.
   "Therefore, I hope the 'global dossiers' will become a
reality in the future," he added.

<Company's Profile>
   Zeneca Yakuhin, a Japanese subsidiary of Zeneca Group plc, is
in charge of distribution and sales promotion for Zeneca's
drugs.
   Zeneca Group, which are currently comprised of three
divisions -- pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialties --
was demerged by ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) in the UK in
1993.
   Tenormin and Inderal have been well known as the world's two
most widely prescribed beta blockers since the former pharma
division of the ICI launched these products.  Furthermore,
Zeneca has drugs for breast cancer, prostate cancer and
antiseptics.
   Zeneca group spent 83 billion yen in R&D expenditure on sales
of 717 billion yen.  It has 7,000 researchers among 30,000
employees worldwide.
   In addition to Zeneca Yakuhin -- 60% and 40% of whose stocks
are owned by Zeneca Ltd and Sumitomo Chemicals, respectively, --
Zeneca has another subsidiary named, Zeneca KK which is
responsible for developing and manufacturing products in Japan.

Looking Forward to Working Together


   -- Carl F. Taeusch, Japan Representative, Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America
   As we look ahead to the year of the Rat, one wonders whether
it could possibly be as eventful as the year of the Boar.  For
PhRMA in Japan this past year meant a changing of the guard --
from Bryan Wright, who retired to the countryside of England
after a long and distinguished career in the pharmaceutical
business, including the last two years as Japan Representative
for PhRMA, to Carl Taeusch, who left Merck & Co of New Jersey,
USA to take on this new assignment from July 1.
   This is my second term of extended residency in Japan in
conjunction with the pharmaceutical business.  My earlier
experience started in March of 1984, when I came as a lawyer for
MSD Japan just after Merck's acquisition of a controlling
interest in Banyu Pharmaceutical.  The problems we faced as an
industry (in contrast to the problems of individual companies)
then were not that different from the problems facing us now --
in brief, cost containment -- but there is more of a sense of
crisis now as the government struggles with an ever rising
healthcare bill caught between the weakened economy and the
specter of a growing elderly population with greater demands on
the system.
   During the 1980s, while pharmaceutical prices in most
countries normally rose reflecting inflation, in Japan the
industry had to deal with price cuts, irregularly at first, but
soon to become a biennial ritual.  By 1991, the anxiety
preceding the rituals became somewhat more predictable with the
introduction of the R-zone.
   During 1995, the whole litany of horrors has been laid before
us.  Repricing has taken on a variety of meanings: in addition
to the biennial price "revisions," we are told that prices will
be cut if sales exceed official forecasts, or there are changes
in the conditions of the original price listing, or if new
indications are added after listing.  Older products were
threatened with even sharper cuts, to bring their prices more in
line with their generic competitions.  There was talk to
rethinking the entire pricing system, including elimination of
the R-zone.  More recently, the Ministry of Health and Welfare
has suggested that pharmaceutical companies should bear all
patient treatment costs which coincide with a clinical trial
sponsored by a company, including costs related to a preexisting
condition and not to the trial itself.
   All these were raised in 1995; some have been decided upon
for implementation in April, 1996; other decisions have been
postponed for further consideration.  As my colleagues Bob Fluss
and Hiro Shigeta have pointed out separately, these issues have
brought the Japanese, American, and European Associations
together with a common goal to clarify our positions with
Chuikyo (the Central Social Insurance Medical Council) and the
Ministry of Health and Welfare and to try to deflect those
proposals which make the least sense.  There has been remarkable
unity.  For me personally, it has been a unique opportunity to
get to know my colleagues in the three associations, as well as
the players at the Ministry and on the Chuikyo more quickly than
might otherwise have been possible.  In the coming year as the
issues become more focused, we will continue to work together,
not only to seek the most cost effective solutions, but also to
reach out to patients to see that their interests are not
forgotten as the reforms take hold.

   From PhRMA to all, a happy and successful 1996!

Monitoring Implementation of Kengisho Rules


   Hiroaki Shigeta, Chairman of Pharmaceuticals Committee,
European Business Community
   I would like to wish PHARMA JAPAN and all its readers a very
happy and prosperous new year.
   In my last year's message, I spoke highly of the creation of
Ihoshin (Council on Medical Insurance) and expressed my hope
that through this committee the pharmaceutical industry would
actively participate in important policy debates on health care
issues.  As it turned out, while Ihoshin was slow getting itself
started, Chuikyo's (the Central Social Insurance Medical
Council) subcommittee took on the initiative and came up with
the now famous Ronten memo (Chuikyo Memorandum).  Although
health care issues were, and are, wide-ranging, the subcommittee
focused solely on issues surrounding drug remuneration.
Chuikyo's intent to make debates more transparent and to involve
the pharmaceutical industry in discussions by organizing two
hearings was well appreciated.  Nonetheless, the end results as
expressed in Kengisho (Chuikyo Recommendation) finalized on
November 22 of last year contain measures potentially
devastating to the industry.
   While new product pricing procedures offer incentives for
R&D-based companies to further strive for breakthrough and
innovative drugs, repricing rules would dampen and undermine
companies' efforts to bring to the market and actively engage in
information activity on innovative products.  Although decisions
on repricing of products listed in the NHI for a long time has
been postponed for 1997, we should continue to oppose uniform
pricing of branded and generic products.  In this respect, I
join my colleagues from PhRMA, PMS, and JPMA in insisting that
the industry must be represented in future discussions of
Chuikyo on this last issue.  It is also a good place to
emphasize once more that we, the industry, should be invited as
representatives in future health care debates by Chuikyo.
   For 1996, EBC-PC would continue to work closely with JPMA,
PhRMA, and PMS to monitor the implementation of Kengisho rules
particularly as they pertain to new product pricing.  We would
like to be a partner in the discussion of the long-term listing
issue with the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Chuikyo.  We
would like to look closely at the impact of other measures such
as expansions of lump-sum payment.
   Starting in 1996, EBC-PC would like to take concrete steps to
further strengthen our ties with EFPIA and Interpharma.
Although we have been working closely together on selective
issues, the relationship should be even closer and more
professional as European health care issues are becoming more
relevant to us here in Japan.
   Once again, a Happy 1996.

1996 Will Be a Year of Implementation


   R. D. Fluss, Chairman, Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Subcommittee of the Trade Expansion Committee, The American
Chamber of Commerce in Japan
   Looking back, 1995 was a very significant year in many
respects.  More proposed changes and new policies in the
healthcare system were discussed and debated than in any other
recent time.  The focus of the proposals was cost containment --
more narrowly, pharmaceutical cost containment -- but the
effects may be broader.  One of our concerns was that the
broader issues were not well defined or discussed in spite of
our efforts to bring them into the debate.  Issues such as
quality of care, maintaining appropriate incentives to fund
innovative research, measures which appear to save costs in the
short term but may only shift costs to other parts of the
healthcare system were not thoroughly discussed or analyzed.
But they were raised and we in the industry are hopeful that
further input and discussion will result in rational, effective
new policies which will achieve the desired objectives.
   The past year had several positive, unanticipated benefits.
Nothing promotes cooperation like a common concern.  As the new
policies and rules evolved, the European, Japanese, and American
pharmaceutical associations came together, worked harder and
more cooperatively than at any other time during my experience
in Japan.  When the three Ronten memos (Chuikyo Memorandum) were
made public and we realized the number and scope of the
proposals being discussed in the Chuikyo (the Central Social
Insurance Medical Council) Subcommittee, we immediately
redoubled our efforts to work together in a constructive,
positive way.  Additionally, our input and interaction with
Chuikyo and the Ministry of Health and Welfare took on a new
intensity.  Long arguing for a "seat at the table" to discuss
healthcare issues with Chuikyo, we nevertheless still came up
short of full membership and participation in the process.  But
we were invited in to give our views.  Better to be in the
hearing room than out in the hallway, but still not as good as
being on the committee.  As for our relationship with and access
to the Ministry of Health and Welfare officials, it has been and
remains very satisfactory.
   Looking ahead, 1996 will be a year of implementation.  We
will see how the new policies and rules will be applied and work
their way through the system.  We will watch closely to see if
the intended results are occurring.  And we will continue to
argue that the solution to rising healthcare costs is not so
easy or simplistic as merely holding down or decreasing the cost
of just one component of a complex and interrelated system.
Controlling costs while maintaining a high quality, full-access
healthcare system, with a robust, innovative pharmaceutical
industry, and economically sound hospitals, physicians,
pharmacists, and other healthcare providers may appear to be
difficult to accomplish.  But that is, or should be, the goal.
My colleagues and I in the pharmaceutical industry are committed
to continue to work together and with the Ministry of Health and
Welfare and f to achieve it.
   I wish you all a successful and happy new year.

It's Tough to Be Optimistic


   --P. Reed Maurer, President, Nippon Pharma Promotion KK
   Chicken Little attracted a large following because of a four
word statement he told everyone he met on the road to see the
king.  "The sky is falling," he said repeatedly.  Others joined
in the chorus without looking up to confirm if Chicken Little
was right or wrong.
   The pharmaceutical industry enters 1996 with a fear the sky
is falling.  The Chuikyo (the Central Social Insurance Medical
Council) deliberations do not make sense, even to those patient
souls who honestly try to understand.  Progress toward
transparency is set back by those who prefer cutting deals in a
private room.  Rational pricing is threatened by arbitrary
decisions to balance the demands of the Ministry of Finance and
the Japan Medical Association.
   The Ministry of Health and Welfare once led the developed
world's regulatory agencies in terms of review time.  While it
took the FDA 32 months to approve an NDA, the Ministry of Health
and Welfare did the job in 18 months.  Then came sorivudine and
HIV contaminated blood.  Now the Ministry of Health and Welfare
spends its time forcing companies to hold press conferences to
announce product recalls.  NDA approval times are getting
longer, more silly questions are asked, while officials profess
their commitment to innovation.
   Good men with vision inside companies at all levels are
frustrated and stalemated by those who are comfortable with what
worked yesterday.  They believe cutting expenses is a creative
strategy.
   Generics, that is, old technology gets good press and the
energy of more people than research leads with the promise to
cure a disease rather than treat its symptoms.
   The JMA concocts dubious economic arguments to prove they
deserve more money while the entire country is deflating.  Like
modern Robin Hoods they would take from the rich, undeserving
drug companies to give to the poor, suffering doctors.
   Pharmacists want to be respected, but run for regulated cover
when efficient chain store operators encroach on their
territory.  Resale price maintenance and pharmacists more adept
at selling tissue paper than drugs are to be protected at all
costs.
   It's tough to be optimistic when there are so many prophets
of doom telling us the sky is falling.  The pharmaceutical
industry will be dealt a knockout blow by Chuikyo.  The Ministry
of Health and Welfare will bend everyone to their will and run
the show in an arbitrary, nontransparent manner; men of vision
will be suppressed or sent home; generics will take over the
world; and doctors will give their BMW's better care than their
patients.
   Chicken Little's merry band of pessimists were eaten by an
optimistic fox who understood the reality of the situation.
1996 will be a good year to understand the difference between
what is talked about and what is actually done.
   Best wishes for a healthy, optimistic New Year.

1995: A Year of Negative Progress in Europe? - PART I


   --Donald Macarthur, Pharmaceutical Writer & Consultant
   Last year will be remembered in Europe as the year of the
mega-mergers among pharmaceutical companies and particularly for
the fear these evoked among thousands of ordinary employees.
Boots, Glaxo, Pharmacia, Marion Merrell Dow, Fisons, BASF,
Wellcome, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Upjohn, or Hoechst.  It didn't
matter if you worked for the acquirer or the acquired, or for
one of the rumored targets, unless you were a shareholder, much
of 1995 was an uncomfortable time.
   In the past two years alone there have been around $70
billion worth of mergers and acquisitions in an industry with a
yearly turnover of just $200 billion.  Many of the earlier deals
have hitherto impacted the American market, where new healthcare
management systems and more demanding payers have obliged the
industry to restructure.  By comparison, the environment in
Europe has probably eased if anything after the cost containment
crises of 1992, but this did not deter the deal makers.  As an
article in Time Magazine aptly put it: "Pharmaceutical
manufacturers regularly caution their customers about mixing
medicines, but when it comes to combining with each other, they
appear to have thrown caution to the wind".
   The rationale for the consolidation we have seen trips easily
off the financial advisor's tongue: "more market power...wider
geographical spread...higher global ranking...an opportunity to
improve margins...to spread the cost and risk of R&D...to
rationalize capital investment...achieve synergies...pool
resources," and so on.  All this is true, of course, but there
are downsides.  For a start, there is no evidence with the
industry's core activity -- its only justification for existence
   innovative new product research, that bigger equates with
better.  Just the opposite.  Adding layers of complexity and
bureaucracy, and having a less interactive atmosphere may act as
a disincentive to creative individuals.  Even companies from the
same county often have totally different ways of doing things
and it can take decades to re-establish a single new company
culture.  There is also a tremendous human cost because no
savings can be achieved without making some good people
redundant.
   It is well known that concerns over the human facet of M&A
rather than its financial consequences have kept Japanese firms
mere bit players in this particular game, both at home and
overseas.  They believe a company, with its tightly knit culture
carefully nurtured by management, is an extended family to which
each member should make a life-long commitment.  Consequently,
the idea of buying and selling what is in effect people, and
trying to blend two unique corporate cultures together is
distasteful.  In particular, they recognize that patents and
trade marks are not the industry's most valuable forms of
intellectual property, rather it is their employees, and
especially in their scientists that the future lies.
   Last year I read in a contributed article to PHARMA JAPAN of
the lament of an imaginary Dr. Suzuki.  He had run a 15-man R&D
project team in the Japanese subsidiary of a European company
for six years when head office abruptly decided to terminate his
project.  Suzuki may be a pseudonym used to protect his identity
or pure fiction, I have no way of knowing, but the story line
turned into reality for me soon afterwards.
   A leading multinational announced that one of its discovery
research centers near my home was to close.  Though small, this
center had discovered a number of important new drugs including
one which is still among the global top-10 by sales.  Even more
remarkably, it could even lay claim, if not as the actual
birthplace of antibiotics, then as the place where they spent
their formative years, for it was here that the structure of the
6-APA nucleus was elucidated.  Its microbiologists and chemists
were not content to dwell on past glories.  A number of
promising leads in new areas were under investigation, but post-
merger rationalization was demanded and so it had to go.  Sixty
of the 140 staff were offered an alternative US posting, but at
least three -- with 42 years' loyal service between them --
declined to go.  I know this because each applied for a part-
time editorial position in my new publishing company.
   Readers will feel, and rightly so, that this scenario could
not happen in Japan.  However, it serves to illustrate the
international dimension to pharmaceutical research today, in
which Japanese companies are increasingly participating.  A
tripolor structure -- based on the US, Europe, and Japan -- is
now the norm for all the major players, regardless of where they
originate.  To my mind, a short article, also from PHARMA JAPAN
and coincidentally just a month prior to the Suzuki story, shows
that mistreatment of research personnel is no respecter of
nationality.  A Japanese company, the report said, was going to
put in place "a flexible employment policy" for R&D overseas,
including the use of annual contracts, rather than the more
secure conditions enjoyed by equivalent staff at home.  It will
be interesting to see over time how productive this overseas
research center will be.
   Management of non-Japanese has always been Japanese
industry's Achilles heel.  One of the reasons that there has not
been an overseas acquisition or joint venture of note since 1992
is the problem seen from the Japanese side of bringing outsiders
in, and coping with their very different ways of working, needs,
and aspirations.  Though painfully slow, the issue may be
circumnavigated, or at least postponed, by putting ex-patriate
staff in place instead.  Once a decision to globalize research
is made, however, this option is not available; otherwise the
whole point of doing R&D overseas and tapping into the local
research culture is lost.  To make matters worse, the brightest
and most original researchers are also very likely to be the
people most difficult to man-manage.  Dropping this "us" and
"them" attitude would be a start.
   After all, if nothing else, the mergers are creating one of
the most international of all industries, where the term
"foreign" has no place.  The big players are not only becoming
bigger, they are becoming stateless too.  Jan Leschly, CEO of
SmithKline Beecham, personifies the trend.  He grew up and was
educated in Denmark, has spent most of his career with companies
in the US, and now heads a British-registered one.  SB, like
several other leading European-origin companies, already earn
the majority of their profits in the US, and a few -- such as
Boehringer Ingelheim, Pharmacia, and Novo Nordisk -- boast Japan
as their number-one single market for sales.
   Even before Upjohn, Pharmacia had experienced an unbelievable
13 mergers over a few short years.  When the latest tie-up is
finalized, the US-Swedish-Italian company will have its
corporate base in London, with the CEO an American and the
chairman a Swede.  Ivax of the US and Norway's Nycomed have also
chosen London to plan the globalization of their combined
generics businesses, already large through previous
international M&As, but now the undisputed leader in the world.
Even wholesalers are following the trend.  Germany's Gehe
followed its earlier buy-out of France's OCP with the
acquisition of AAH from the United Kingdom last year.
Headquarters of the wholesaling division -- larger in turnover
than any in the US and with activities in nine west and east
European countries -- is in Paris, not Gehe's Stuttgart base.
   Apart from the mergers, the big issue in 1995 in Europe was
actually a series of non-events.  Attempts across a number of
countries to introduce US-style managed care initiatives --
PBMs, mail order, and disease management -- all ran into
difficulties.  In short, the natives were not sufficiently
impressed by what they heard from across the Atlantic to
introduce privatized concepts into long-established social
solidarity systems which, although creaking somewhat, still
function reasonably well.  Europe is not too proud to
experiment, though, and pilot managed care schemes will appear
soon, though these may not look much like the US model.
   Managed care and mergers may have been over-hyped by
consultancies and brokers with vested interests, but radical
measures are needed at a time of tremendous change, it is
argued.  I believe "change" is a very overused word.  The
industry is certainly changing but the environment in which it
works, in Europe anyway, is moving at a far slower rate.  Italy
may have experienced 30 different decrees modifying the patient
co-payment rate over the same time period Japan has merely been
discussing the possibility of change, but this is normal in a
country which has had 54 prime ministers in 50 years.
Politicians in Germany may argue endlessly and in the full
public gaze about healthcare reform, but this style and the
habit of frequent recourse to the courts is how the German
system has always worked.

1995: A Year of Negative Progress in Europe? - PART II


   Meanwhile, most Japanese companies -- the very description
only serves to emphasize their lack of overseas market presence
   continue with their long-established policy of "wait and
see."  Western boldness, Japanese caution.  Who is right?  Only
time will tell.  Mergers and vertical integration into disease
management are the current fashions, but these may not last.
While the pain is clear to see, the benefits for the business
have yet to be realized.  They may never be and the craze in the
next decade could be for de-mergers and a refocus on R&D.
Wouldn't Japanese companies, whether by design or default, then
have a head's start?
   A happy and profitable new year to my friends in Japan and
all readers of PHARMA JAPAN

Kissei Makes Licensing Agreement with Syntex for Ranolazine


   Kissei Pharmaceutical announced on December 18 that it has
entered into a licensing agreement with Syntex of the US for the
development and marketing of ranolazine, the US company's angina
pectoris remedy.  The agreement gives Kissei exclusive rights to
develop and market the angina pectoris drug in the Asian region
including Japan.
   Originated by Syntex, ranolazine is a new compound which
differs in mechanism of action from conventional drugs for
angina pectoris.  It improves energy hypometabolism and a
shortage in the supply of energy production in ischemic
myocardium by activating glucose utilization routes.  Thus, it
helps maintain cardiokinetic momentum and increase oxygen
efficiency.  It is now in Phase III in the US.

set up a new company on April 1 next year in a venture with
Fisher Scientific Worldwide of the US.  This new joint venture,
to be called Fisher Scientific Japan, will be headed by Takaaki
Matsutani, vice-president of Toho.  An authorized capital of 40
million yen will be earmarked for the establishment of the new
company (paid-in capital: 10 million yen).  The share capital
investment ratio will be 1:1.  The new company will undertake
the marketing of Fisher's physico-chemical products, notably
solvents, reagents, and glass products, through Toho's
nationwide sales and distribution network.  Toho welcomes the
joint venture as "another milestone in the 47-year-old company's
development as a total health care enterprise."
   Fisher Scientific Worldwide is a subsidiary of Fisher
Scientific International Inc (manufacturer and marketer of
general scientific and experimental products).  It was
established in 1992 as an export-based sales company.  It had
sales of 153 billion yen in 1995 and expects sales for 1996 to
reach 240 billion yen.

Lump-sum Bulk-buying Blocks Growth of Generics, Says Mr.
Matsutani


   In an interview with PHARMA JAPAN on December 15, Takaaki
Matsutani, vice-president of Toho Pharmaceutical, a leading drug
wholesaler in Japan, stated that his company may take a positive
stance toward dealing with generics in the future, saying:
"Since wholesalers cannot obtain profit in the hospital market
at present, they may consider marketing generics to successfully
carry out price negotiations."  At present, wholesalers promote
generics almost entirely to GPs, and hospitals which have
introduced the flat-sum reimbursement system.  Mr. Matsutani
hopes that wholesalers can obtain profit by presenting prices of
individual products, including generics, on the hospital market,
where wholesalers obtain no profit from branded products due to
lump-sum bulk-buying.  "For this purpose, however, it is
necessary for generic manufacturers to establish close
relationships with major hospitals and persuade hospital doctors
and managers that their products are reliable," he said.
   Mr. Matsutani was rather pessimistic about the growth of
generics in the short-run, saying: "Sales of generics were
expected to increase in hospitals which introduced the flat-sum
reimbursement system, but these hospitals continue to use brand-
name products, although their consumption has decreased.  In
addition, generics are switched to brand-name products by
pharmacies when hospitals which use generics introduce the
bungyo system.  I believe that sales of generics will increase
only if patients' out-of-pocket payment for healthcare costs is
increased and the use of generics directly profits patients.  I
don't believe that the market for generics will significantly
increase under the current healthcare system in Japan.  In the
longer run, however, generics from reliable research-oriented
companies and companies with worldwide marketing networks, which
can assume great responsibilities and deal with the Product
Liability Law, may achieve rapid growth."  In Mr. Matsutani's
opinion, lump-sum bulk-buying is a major stumbling block to the
growth of generics.  "When major drug distribution system
reforms were carried out in 1992, I hoped that it would enable
wholesalers to present prices of both brand-name products and
generics to hospitals.  Four years after that reform, however, I
realize that nothing has changed," he said.

RPR Gencell Plans Gene Therapy Trials in Japan


   At a press interview in Tokyo on December 12, Thierry
Soursac, general manager of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR) Gencell,
said that his company's R&D efforts are focused on (1)
development of drugs for gene therapy (in-vivo therapy) and (2)
cell treatment in cell processing centers (extracorporeal
therapy).  The company plans to start the gene therapy business
on a commercial basis in 1999, and hopes to reach the break-even
point by the year 2005.  He said that the company is being
efficiently operated with 60% of R&D investment going toward
malignant tumors and 20% for vascular restenosis and
arteriosclerosis.  Clinical studies have already begun in the
United States on 10 products related to gene therapy including
the P53 retrovirus, and five cell therapy-related products
including CD5/8.
   Kensuke Tomita, the general manager of RPR Gencell for the
Asia-Pacific region, said in the same interview that multiple
clinical studies in the gene therapy field will also be started
in Japan.  Although he did not name the research institutions or
companies which will participate in these studies, he said that
this is being worked out at present so that the first project
can begin as soon as possible.  Mr. Soursac has surveyed the
Japanese market and he feels that only a few research
institutions can participate in such projects at present, but
opportunities for research in this field are increasing with the
start of collaborative studies on gene therapy in the
industrial, governmental, and academic sectors by the Ministry
of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI), and he expects that this business will
expand in the future with the cooperation of Japanese partners.

Eli Lilly Japan, Chugai to Co-market and Develop Raloxifene


   Bryce D. Carmine, president of Eli Lilly Japan KK, and Osamu
Nagayama, president of Chugai Pharmaceutical, announced at a
joint press conference on December 13 that they have entered
into a collaborative agreement to co-develop and co-market
raloxifene, new osteoporosis treatment Lilly is developing, in
Japan.  Raloxifene is a new class of drug called selective
estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).  In describing the agreement
Mr. Carmine said, "Lilly's experience in developing raloxifene
in the United States and Europe combined with Chugai's extensive
development and marketing expertise in osteoporosis in Japan
will allow raloxifene to be developed more quickly and
extensively, thereby bringing improved health benefits to
Japanese patients at an earlier date."  For Chugai's part Mr.
Nagayama said the agreement "is congruent with our strategies,"
adding that having an integrated team from the two firms will
advance R&D more quickly.  In Japan the drug is currently in
Phase II.
   Eli Lilly developed raloxifene in the US and the drug has
started clinical trials in Europe.  The drug selectively binds
to estrogen receptors exhibiting estrogen-like effects in bone
and lipid metabolism while blocking the effects of estrogen on
the uterus and breast.  Thus the drug overcomes the undesirable
hemorrhaging side effects of current estrogen drugs.  In
addition, with regard to the risk of developing uterine or
breast cancer, Mr. Carmine said that clinical trials in the US
and Europe have confirmed its safety.
   For the Japanese clinical trials, the two companies under the
terms of the agreement will share R&D costs equally and for the
time being Eli Lilly Japan and Chugai will jointly carry out
late Phase II trials.  The effort also involves cooperation with
the Eli Lilly development team of the US and the companies
expect to apply for approval to manufacture the drug in Japan
within three or four years.

Drug Wholesalers' Sales/Gross Profit Ratio Hits 11% for First
Time


   The Federation of Japan Pharmaceutical Wholesalers'
Associations announced on December 7 its summary of business
conditions in the drug wholesale industry for 1995.  Taken
together with the industry's performance in 1994, sales on a
weighted-average basis recorded a year-on-year rise of 4.89%,
while the sales/gross profits ratio dropped 0.72 percentage
points, to 11.44%, reflecting the trend towards declining
profitability among wholesalers in the aftermath of the second
round of reforms in drug distribution.  The Business Management
Committee surveyed FJPWA members as of May 18 this year, on the
77 firms that closed the books on March 31, 1995 out of the 122
firms responding.  On a sales weighted basis, it covered 90% of
the market.  On the same day, the federation announced that for
the half-year results at 41 leading wholesalers with a financial
year ending March 31, 1996, operating profits declined 7.6% with
2.1% lower net profits on an overall 4% increase in sales.
   Ken Suzuki, chairman of the committee (and managing director
of Nichiei), expressed concern that the sales/gross profits
ratio had fallen to the 11% level for the first time since the
surveys started.  As one of the causes of the performance he
cited manufacturers invoice prices.  In the previous round of
NHI drug price revision, the drug price was down 7% while
wholesalers' actual sales prices declined 5%, reducing the drug
price discrepancy to 2%.  However, because the invoice price was
not discounted by 4%, a 1% gap surfaced leading to the
conclusion that this caused the sales/gross profits ratio to
drop.  In addition to this, he explained that even though
wholesalers were able to shrink the ratio of expenses to cash on
hand by 0.25 points, they were still pursued by declining
profits.  The results of the survey showed that although firms
made efforts to boost efficiency by raising productivity of
marketing specialists and reducing products carried, as well as
shrinking the number of months of trade receivables, these
measures were insufficient to cover the rapid decline in
profitability.  With regard to future conditions, Mr. Suzuki
said that from the tendencies up to now, it is apparent that the
sales/gross profits ratio will decline even further.  Thus the
question is to what extent expenses can be lowered.  He stressed
the importance of cutting expenses further.

Nippon Kayaku: 1995 Forecast Revised Upwards


   Nippon Kayaku on December 8 announced an upward revision to
its projections for the 1995 business year ending on May 31,
1996.  The initial forecast called for lower profits on slightly
higher sales for the semiannual and the annual settlement terms.
However, for the half-year term the company achieved ordinary
profits of 3,500 million yen and net profits of 1,400 million
yen on sales of 53,000 million yen, all improvements over the
initial projections.  While sales for the year are expected to
be the same as the original forecast, ordinary profits look set
to reach 7,800 million yen with net profits of 3,400 million
yen, both upward revisions.  According to Nippon Kayaku, the
firm attributes the improved performance to better than expected
growth of new products as the sales ratio of the domestic
pharmaceutical division was relatively high, cost ratios
improved due to the high yen, and sales and administrative costs
were reduced.  As a result of these factors, the company saw its
profits rise.  With the higher interim profits, the results for
the year seem assured.

Issues in Focus (31)


   Blood Coagulation Factor Products and HIV Infection
   Although litigation over HIV infections from unheated blood
coagulation factor products is moving toward a settlement on the
advice of the courts, the affected patients are not satisfied
without an apology from the government.  In addition, new cases
not limited to the known cases of hemophiliac patients are
appearing which is leading to growing confusion.
   In the Diet, especially in the Committee on Health and
Welfare, there are discussions almost daily on the HIV infection
incident.  One of the focal points of the issue is the approval
of heat-treated products in 1985 and why it was not possible to
approve the products earlier.  Approval of heat-treated products
came a year and a half after approval in the US and in the
meantime Japan continued to import and use products that were
not treated with heat, which spread the infection.
   The Ministry of Health and Welfare's response, even at that
time, was not as slow to react to such cases as the media
claimed, having gained experience with the thalidomide and
chinoform incidents.  Thus in the Diet discussions, the Ministry
of Health and Welfare insisted that it has always responded
swiftly.
   At the time the infections occurred, there was nothing
unusual in the two-year plus period normally required for drugs
to go through the approval process.  The length of reviews in
Japan was a source of trade friction with the US, so in 1987,
the Ministry of Health and Welfare proposed new standard review
periods (a year and a half for new drugs) for approval.  In the
ministry's view it responded quickly, although this didn't wash
with the public and it came in for criticism for its tardy
response.
   Apart from time lags of approval, the cause of the tragedy
may be identified in "perception gaps" between the Ministry of
Health and Welfare and healthcare providers.
   First of all, at least as early as 1985, most people believed
that AIDS was an infectious disease limited to a certain high-
risk group and through the experience with the Japanese blood
collection system, Japanese experts did not feel that blood
supplies from the US were extensively infected with the HIV
virus.  Furthermore, it was widely know that the HIV virus is
only weakly contagious.  Thus members of the CPAC (Central
Pharmaceutical Affairs Council) were not very concerned.
   One newspaper pointed out that the Japanese government should
have ordered importers of unheated blood coagulation factor
products to recall their products immediately after the approval
of heated products.  However, neither did the US government
order producers of unheated products to recall them at the early
stages of the tragedy and the US ordered the recall at almost
the same time as Japan did.  In this sense, the US awareness of
the risk may be similar to that of Japan.
   In the second place, pharmacologists feared that heating
fresh blood products might cause the components to become
denatured and could result in side-effect cases.  Thus they
decided to conduct a careful review of heated versions of the
biological products, which have always received careful scrutiny
of quality specifications and for toxicity because of the nature
of the product.
   There is no effective drug for hemophiliacs other than blood
coagulation factor.  At the time the Ministry of Health and
Welfare was more concerned about the safety of the heated
product than the risk of AIDS.  This reaction was quite natural
in view of the government's stance toward drug approval, but it
was precisely because the review was conducted so carefully that
the tragedy developed.
   The case of heated versions of blood coagulation factor shows
that in a drug that involves high public risk, the decision
makers should make a quick and sometimes risky decision, as a
woman reviewer in the FDA did to minimize the impact of the
thalidomide incident.

JPA Calls for New Pharmacist Working Efficiencies


   The Japan Pharmaceutical Association's 28th Congress of
Pharmaceutical Sciences convened for two days on December 9 and
10 in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture.
   Commenting on the current situation surrounding pharmacists,
Tasuku Yoshiya, president of the JPA expressed his feeling that
the industry has come to a point where all the unsolved issues
since the pharmacist system was established a century ago are
emerging.  He said: "The proposals for reforming pharmacology
education are bogged down in the Ministry of Education, Culture,
and Science.  As for the progress in bungyo (separation of
prescribing and dispensing functions), a higher priority has
been given to eliminating inappropriate forms of bungyo.  There
is also a possibility that the government can deregulate the
types of operations that can sell drugs.  All these factors
would require pharmacists with even wider and deeper knowledge
with heavier responsibilities.  Our association would like to
explore and establish new functions for pharmacists that can
fill the requirements of the coming century."
   Reorganize Dispensing Fee Structures for Complete Bungyo
   Speaking before the Japan Pharmaceutical Association's
subcommittee on social insurance, JPA Executive Director Yasuji
Akiba expressed his view that the next revision of dispensing
fees would primarily involve changing the fee structure among
different types of pharmacies and allocating lower fees for
secnd pharmacies (monzen yakkyoku).  He said "Issues including
medical treatment and separation of prescribing and dispensing
functions are not easily understood by the general public.  This
is especially true when these issues are combined with the
financial system.  In order to attain self-evident fairness,
second pharmacies should at least be given lower dispensing fees
than other types of outside pharmacies.  This means that in
order to attain complete bungyo, the structure of dispensing
fees among different types of pharmacies should be reorganized,
or else the bungyo project will fail.  After the next revision
of dispensing fees, some pharmacies would gain more
reimbursement points while some other such as the monzen
yakkyoku would be given fewer points."
   Progress in Medical Team Cooperation
   Speaking in a symposium titled "Stepping Up to Pharmaceutical
Care -- Cooperating with the Medical Team" in the subcommittee
on drugs for women, Fumikazu Takeda, president of the Saitama
Cancer Center, stressed the effectiveness of pain control,
especially in the use of morphine, in view of world trends for
improving cancer patients' quality of life.  He cautioned that
these drugs should be carefully used, taking into consideration
such factors as types and characteristics of pain, dosages,
time, and preventing side effects.  He foresees a greater role
for pharmacists in providing pain control care.  He also
expressed his view that when pain control care is fully
implemented there will be no need for euthanasia legislation.
   Interim Report on Pharmacy Grand Design
   The Japan Pharmaceutical Association on December 9 submitted
an interim report entitled "Pharmacy Grand Design," which
describes the policy of the organization now being developed, to
a joint subcommittee surveying pharmacies and the economies of
the pharmaceutical industry.  The policy describes what roles
pharmacies should play in the year 2005.  The Grand Design
describes 16 policies to reach the objective, including the
following nine: (1) rationalization of the scale and
distribution of pharmacies; (2) 24-hour pharmacy operation and
stand-by system; (3) rationalization of the supply system; (4)
public service security; (5) improving the quality of
pharmacists; (6) implementation of pharmaceutical care; (7)
constructing a drug information support system; (8) drug use
evaluation; and (9) a pharmaceutical quality assurance system.
   According to the report, the number of pharmacies that will
be needed by 2005 is 20,000 with some 70,000 pharmacists.  The
number of legal prescriptions issued is expected to total 700
million, with the ratio of patients who actually receive
prescriptions to be filled by outside pharmacies estimated to be
48%.  This means that one pharmacist would fill around 10,000
prescriptions a year.  By 2005, the number of drug store
pharmacists would need to increase by 3,000 every year.  Based
on this projection, the number of pharmacies required to fill
prescriptions by the time bungyo is fully established would be
24,000, with 96,000 pharmacists filling one billion
prescriptions.  Seen in this perspective, 24,000 is equivalent
to the current number of elementary schools or post offices in
Japan.
   For specific economic indicators, the report cites annual
sales of 160 million yen per pharmacy in 2005 which breaks down
to 125 million yen, or 78%, for filling prescriptions and 35
million yen, or 22%, for OTC drug sales.  A pharmacy would fill
35,000 prescriptions per year, or 120 a day, on average with
each prescription worth about 3,600 yen.  The minimum staff
required by a pharmacy would be three full-time pharmacists, one
part-time pharmacist, and two other store employees.  At
present, 60% of JPA members only have one pharmacist.  It is
unlikely that Japanese pharmacies will meet the objective of
attaining this number unless they take drastic measures over the
next ten years.

Domestic Drug Production Up 1.0%, Imports Down 2.3%


   The Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau released statistical data
on November 30 on trends in pharmaceutical industry production
for fiscal 1994.  The domestic production of drugs was 5,750,300
million yen with imports amounting to 571,300 million yen, for a
total of 6,321,600 million yen, an increase of 0.7%, or 42,100
million yen, over the previous year.  Domestic production grew
1.0%, continuing the low growth trend since 1990.  Imports also
continued to decline from the previous year.
   By major therapeutic category, cardiovascular system drugs
continued to lead the way with a 6.5% increase.  While fiscal
1993 saw production of antihyperlipidemic drugs jump 34.8% over
the previous fiscal year, the rate of production upsurge
remained at 20.0% for fiscal 1994.  The same was the case with
antihypertensives and vasodilators.  Also among the high-growth
drugs were sensory organ drugs at 20.4% and urogenital and anal
organ drugs at 20.9%.  Prominent among drugs that declined in
production were Chinese herbal medicines (Kampoyaku) (down
14.3%) and biological products (down 14.0%).

Labeling of Health Food Effects Requested


   With the interest shown in the revision of food and drug
classifications (so-called "shoku yaku kubun") which has changed
the classification of vitamins and senna, a natural drug, from
drugs to foods, the Japan Health Food and Nutrition Food
Association submitted a request to the Inspection and Guidance
Division, PAB, the Ministry of Health and Welfare recently,
which lists the opinions of the health food industry on the
classification, including administration methods and doses for
foods and the possibility of including the effects of the food
in labels.
   This request includes calls for a change from the current
five component classification to a three component
classification: substances used exclusively as drugs, substances
used as food, and substances used as both food and drugs.  Since
there are forms such as powders and granules used for both foods
and drugs, and it is difficult to differentiate between foods
and drugs by form, the request calls for optional use with no
differentiation from drugs.  Concerning the labeling of food
effects, the request states that in recent years in both Japan
and the other industrialized countries, food has been eaten with
consideration given to prevention and improvements of diseases,
as well as improvements in the structure and functions of the
body, and it is not appropriate to consider such matters as the
role of drugs alone.  In the near future, the law should be
revised to permit the labeling of food effects such as labeling
with an emphasis on health.

Infectious Disease Reports Say Influenza Subsiding


   The Statistics and Information Department of the Minister's
Secretariat recently released the 1994 statistics on infectious
diseases.  According to the statistics, cases of infectious
diseases are generally declining.  While influenza, measles,
whooping cough and other infectious diseases still run their
courses, the number of reported cases continues to decline.
   Physicians who diagnose an infectious disease are obliged to
report it to a health center in their jurisdiction.  The
department's survey was compiled based on such reports.  In 1994
the number of influenza outbreaks reported was 2,404, a drastic
reduction compared to the 16,555 reported in 1993.  By contrast,
the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Infectious Disease Control
Division reports that there were 108,564 influenza-type cases.
The department's survey was calculated on the basis of the
number of cases reported to health centers on a fixed number of
hospitals in their jurisdiction.  When looking at the number of
cases for the same sort of reports over the past three years,
the statistics for infectious diseases were 5,868 cases in 1991;
6,053 in 1992; and 16,655 in 1993, while the Infectious Disease
Control Division's survey reported 258,172; 336,316; and 636,534
for the same years, indicating a huge gap.  This is attributed
to advances in medical technology that have made it easier to
treat influenza and a decline in the feeling of obligation to
report on the part of doctors.
   In addition, the number of cases of infectious diseases,
which had exceeded 10,000 during the first half of 1995,
steadily declined, stopping with a total of 145 and 1,766
reported cases for whooping cough and measles, respectively.
For the population under 15 years of age the morbidity ratio by
age was highest for whooping cough between infancy and 2 years
and for measles at one year of age.

Most of 5,448 Quake Fatalities Sudden Deaths


   The Statistics and Information Department of the Minister's
Secretariat of the Ministry of Health and Welfare recently
released vital statistics on fatalities from the Great Hanshin
Earthquake.  According to a survey of vital statistics there
were 5,448 fatalities, with one and a half times as many deaths
among women as of men and twice as many deaths among those over
65 compared to deaths among men.  More than 80% of the deaths
occurred on the morning the earthquake struck on January 17;
over 70% died from asphyxiation or from being crushed.  As
previously indicated, most of the deaths were instantaneous.
   The survey compiled the figures from obituary notices and
death certificates issued between January and June this year by
municipalities.  By sex, the number of deaths stood at 2,211
males (40.3% of the total) and 3,277 women (59.7%).  The highest
number of deaths occurred in the male 60- to 64-year old age
group, with 223 deaths.  Among the elderly, most of the 370
deaths occurred among women between the ages of 70 and 74.
Among the younger generations there were 297 fatalities in the
20-24 age group, most of whom are presumed to have been
residential students.  The top cause of death was asphyxiation
and crushing, accounting for 4,224 (77.0%) of the fatalities,
followed by 504 deaths from fire or from burn injuries (9.2%).
Asphyxiation and crushing accounted for the overwhelming share,
although fatalities among those over 65 bore the largest share
of any age group of deaths by burning or from burn injuries.
There were also 15 fatalities due to crush syndrome, of whom 12
died more than three days after the quake.  The Vital Statistics
Division will use the data in conjunction with other survey data
for such projects funded by grants for health sciences as a
study group considering disaster medical systems based on the
experience of the Great Hanshin Earthquake and should play a
role in future medical emergencies.

Takeda's R&D Policy Outlined


   In an interview with PHARMA JAPAN on December 13, Masahiko
Fujino, senior managing director of Takeda Chemical Industries,
outlined his company's R&D policy, saying that an NDA is
expected to be filed in Japan and other countries by the end of
1996 for TCV-116, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, and AD-
4833, an antidiabetic agent (insulin sensitivity enhancer).  "We
expect annual sales of 60-80 billion yen worldwide for each of
these products.  Coupled with sales of our existing in-house
drugs, Leuplin (leuprolide) and Takepron (lansoprazole),
overseas sales of our in-house products will account for more
than 50% of their total sales by the year 2000," he said.  He
also expressed great hope for overseas sales of Avan
(idebenone), a cerebral metabolism improver, mentioning that it
may be introduced into other countries, although he did not
indicate when an NDA would be filed.  Avan is currently Takeda's
best-selling product.  "A phase III trial has been completed in
Europe.  I am confident that we will be able to achieve good
sales when it is launched, because it was found to be
significantly more effective than a placebo in patients with
Alzheimer's type dementia in our phase III trial," he said.
   "TCV-116 is expected to be the second angiotensin II receptor
antagonist, following Merck's losartan, but I believe we will be
in a fairly advantageous position in terms of price due to the
lower dosage of our compound.  We may be able to launch AD-4833
in different countries earlier than we expected," Mr. Fujino
said, showing great hopes for these products on the world
market.  New compounds to follow them include an eosinophil
infiltration inhibitor which is expected to be effective for
asthma, and AK-603, an anti-RA drug.  The former is expected to
enter phase I next year, while preparations for a phase II study
are underway for the latter.  "Sales of Avan in Japan are
declining, but I am optimistic they will hit bottom at about 25
billion yen, and it will remain one of our leading products.  In
order to deal with its re-evaluation, we are conducting a
placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial," he said.

Fractures as Endpoint for Osteoporosis Need Further Debate


   At a seminar held by the Japan Osteoporosis Foundation on
December 11, Hajime Orimo, director of the Tokyo Hospital of the
Ministry of Finance, discussed the establishment of fracture
frequency as an endpoint in the draft guidelines on clinical
trials of drugs to treat osteoporosis.  He noted that large-
scale double-blind clinical studies are difficult to conduct
over long periods, and provisional approval should be given
using bone mass as an endpoint.  He also called on the Ministry
of Health and Welfare to reconsider endpoints.  Dr. Orimo said
that the incorporation of fracture studies in the protocol for
post-marketing Phase IV studies is now under investigation, and
coordination of the approval and post-marketing stages is
important.  He indicated that further discussions are required
on fracture studies, and they should not be introduced in
clinical evaluation guidelines at present.  In his lecture at
the seminar, Dr. Orimo estimated that prevention of fractures by
hormone replenishment therapy (HRT) should reduce treatment
costs of fractures by 31.7 billion yen annually.  He stressed
the economic effects of the prophylactic use of HRT and proposed
that HRT agents be approved as prophylactic drugs.
   Dr. Orimo based his estimate of a 31.7 billion yen reduction
on (1) halving of the fracture incidence by HRT according to
foreign data, (2) annual treatment costs for femoral head
fractures (treatment costs of about 2 million yen per case,
including hospitalized cases, multiplied by the number of
patients) of 115.8 billion yen, and (3) annual HRT costs of 26.2
billion yen (about 450,000 yen a year times the number of
patients).  Since the number of fracture patients would be
reduced by one half, the costs would be (2)/2 = 57.9 billion yen
plus the amount in (3), for a savings of 31.7 billion yen
compared to the value in (2).
   With respect to current drug treatment, Dr. Orimo said that
active vitamin D3 accounted for 37.1%, calcitonin for 20%,
ipriflavone for 7%, estrogen for 6.8%, calcium for 5.4%, and
NSAIDs for 29% of all prescriptions written for drugs to treat
osteoporosis in the year from July 1994 through June 1995.  The
overall market scale on an NHI price basis is 121.2 billion yen
with active vitamin D3 making up 41%, calcitonin 32%,
ipriflavone 10.9%, estrogen 0.1%, and calcium 0.8% of the total.

Pharmacoepidemiology Database Focused on in RAD-AR Seminar


   On December 17 in Tokyo, Tadashi Oyake, director of pharmacy
of Kanto Teishin Hospital, delivered a lecture on the value of
databases for pharmacoepidemiology and the role of hospital
pharmacists in a seminar entitled "Basic Concept and
Applications of Pharmacoepidemiology," sponsored by the RAD-AR
Council, Japan.  Based on his experience at his hospital, he
stressed that pharmacoepidemiology can play a very important
role in collecting information necessary to properly evaluate
the efficacy and safety of drugs.  "Databases obtained by
pharmacoepidemiology make it easier to test various hypotheses
and to efficiently answer questions," he said.
   Pointing out that data obtained from applications for
reimbursement, collected for a different purpose, cannot be use
to obtain information necessary for pharmacoepidemiology, he
stressed the need to establish in-house databases to which
doctors and pharmacists can have easy access any time they need
information.  "The use of standard codes, outcome assessment,
data security, and protection of patients' privacy are some of
the factors that need to be taken into consideration when
establishing such databases," he added.
   "At Kanto Teishin Hospital, a four-year plan to establish our
own database has entered its second year.  We want to establish
a fully computerized information system through the cooperation
of all medical professionals at our hospital.  They are making
concerted efforts, collecting information related to drugs'
safety and efficacy, following up on patients, and conducting
questionnaire surveys on them.  In the future, we plan to
connect the pharmacoepidemiology database to the host computer
used to operate our in-house ordering system in order to
construct a total system that is more convenient for users," Mr.
Oyake said.
   Other lectures delivered during the seminar included one on
the basic idea and knowledge of pharmacoepidemiology by
Toshiharu Fujita, chief of the Environmental Epidemiology
Section of the Institute of Public Health, and one on the role
of pharmacoepidemiology in the development of drugs and post-
marketing surveillance by Yasuo Ohashi, professor of
Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the School of Health Sciences
and Nursing of the University of Tokyo.

Suntory to Aim for 13% Increase in Beer Division


   Suntory, on the 5th announced its 1996 policy directive for
its beer division.  On the one hand it will suspend production
of its "Hyouten  Chozo" which has had faltering sales while
expanding sales of its main brand "Moltz" and its foaming beer
"Hops".  For the beer division as a whole, strong sales are
anticipated with a 13% increase over last year sales to 42.5
million cases (1 case contains 20, 633 milliliter bottles).
Sales of "Moltz" are expected to increase 8% over the previous
year to 23.5  million cases.  A 29% increase in sales to 15
million cases has been set as the sales target for "Hops" and "A
policy to make an effort not to raise the price even if the beer
tax increases."  Among overseas brands, Denmark's "Carlsberg
Beer" will show a 20% increase in sales over the previous year
to 600,000 cases due to increases in business use.

NASA Working on
Chelation Follow Up

NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Pasadena, CA) has proposed a
method of quantitative analysis for metal-ion contaminants in solid
and aqueous environmental samples.  The metal ions would first be
chelated, then extracted from the samples and carried through a
suitable restrictor to a gas-chromatograph/mass-spectrometer (GC-
MS) by using a suitable supercritical fluid.

When fully developed, the method might be implemented in a field-
portable apparatus for the detection and quantification of metals
in various matrices without a need for elaborate preparation of
samples.  The apparatus could be used, for example, to analyze soil
samples for toxic metals.

A GC-MS apparatus could be used to analyze samples of soil for
organic materials, but not for metals. Traditionally there was no
way to extract the metals form soil samples and present the metals
to the mass spectrometer in the required gaseous form.  It would be
quite cost effective if both metals and organic compounds could be
analyzed by the same technique of mass spectrometry.

The key step in the proposed technique would be the chelation,
which would convert the metal from an ionic form that is
essentially insoluble in a typical supercritical fluid to a
chelated form that is soluble in a supercritical fluid.  Because
metal chelates extracted via a supercritical fluid are effectively
in the gaseous state, they can be introduced directly into a mass
spectrometer for analysis.

On the basis of their demonstrated ability to form metal chelates,
8-hydroxy-quinoline, acetyl acetone, dialkyldithio-carbamates, and
ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) have been selected for
investigation of their suitability as chelating agents in the
proposed technique.  The investigation will also address the use of
tetralkyl ammonium ions to increase the solubilities of metal
complexes.

The work was done by Mahadeva P. Sinha of Caltech for NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.  The invention is owned by NASA, and a
patent application has been filed.  Inquiries concerning non-
exclusive or exclusive license for its commercial development
should b addressed to the patent counsel, NASA Resident Office-JPL;
Tel: 818/354-5179.  Refer to NPO-19002.

Bayer Looks Into
Biocatalytic Synthesis

Enzymes are known for their ability to selectively catalyze
reactions in both aqueous and non-aqueous media. There is a growing
interest in the biocatalytic synthesis of specialty polymers since
such an approach can generate additional properties such as
chirality and biodegradability.  Biologically synthesized polymers
have been applied as absorbents, biodegradable materials, chiral
adsorbents, liquid crystals, and perm-selective membranes.

Bayer Corp. (1 Mellon Bank Ctr., Pittsburgh, PA 15258; Tel:
412/394-5500, Fax: 412/394-5534) has discovered a process for the
production of polyesters reacting a diol with an acid or acid ester
in the presence of a solid enzymes and supercritical fluids (US
Patent 5,478,910).

Low molecular weight linear aliphatic oligoesters that are hydroxy
terminated have commercial significance for use in the manufacture
of polyurethane resins. The current commercial process is based on
acid/base catalyzed condensation polymerization between a
diacid/diester and a diol. The use of traditional catalysts is
limited because such catalysts tend to have an undesirable effect
on the subsequent polyurethane synthesis.

Supercritical fluids have been described as extraction solvents,
have been used in various industrial extraction processes, and have
been suggested as being useful for a variety of enzyme catalyzed
reactions. With supercritical fluids as the reaction medium, enzyme
enantioselectivity can be manipulated by the pressure of the
system.

In both enzymatic and non-enzyme catalyzed synthesis of oligoesters
and polyesters, it is difficult to control product molecular weight
in a predictable manner. All techniques described to date depend
upon changing the reaction time in order to manipulate molecular
weight. In the case of non-enzyme catalyzed oligo- and polyesters,
the final product typically contains cyclic ester by-products and
small amounts of residual catalyst, both of which can adversely
affect properties of products produced from those oligo- and
polyesters.

The Bayer innovation overcomes most of the above difficulties and
allows for the production of a wide variety of polyesters where it
is relatively simple to produce a material of a desired molecular
weight by merely varying the pressure under which the
polyesterification or polytransesterification reaction is
conducted.

Pesticides Removed
from Fruits, Veggies

Two recent publications describe the removal of pesticides from
vegetables and fruits using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE).
Both studies found SFE an acceptable method for the removal of
pesticides from produce for analysis.

Steven J. Lehotay and Konstantin I. Eller of the Beltsville
Agricultural Research Center of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(Environmental Chemistry Laboratory, Bldg. 7, Rm. 224, Beltsville,
MD 20705-2351; Tel: 301/504-6078) developed a method for analyzing
the levels of 46 pesticides in grapes, carrots, potatoes, and
brocolli.  The multiresidue method used SFE in conjunction with gas
chromatography/ion-trap mass spectrometry in order to extract and
analyze residues.

The SFE was performed at 320 atm and 60oC, and the extracts were
trapped on solid-phase media.  Silica gel bound to octadecylsilane
was found suitable for this purpose.  The trap was then eluted with
acetonitrile.  Next, the chromatographic analysis was performed.
Greater than 80% recoveries were achieved for 39 of the 46
pesticides.  The recoveries of the other pesticides, with the
exception of methamidophos and omethoate, were more than 50%.

Both incurred and fortified samples were used in a subsequent
analysis to evaluate the method.  The blind experiment showed that
this method resulted in recoveries similar to results from seven
laboratories using solvent-based extractions with traditional gas-
chromatograph detectors.

Lehotay tells HTSN that the focus of his work is pesticide analysis
of agricultural commodities, and SFE is one of the primary methods
of extraction being developed by the laboratory.  The study was
published as "Development of a Method of Analysis for 46 Pesticides
in Fruits and Vegetables by Supercritical Fluid Extraction and Gas
Chromatography/Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry" in the Journal of the
Association of Official Analytical Chemistry [78(3), 821-830,
1995].

In a similar study, scientists in Spain used a simple SFE method to
remove pesticide residues from fresh pepper, cucumber, and tomato
samples.  Under moderate conditions, commercial SFE equipment
extracted methamidophos at a level greater than 70%, as well as
chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and procymidone.

The fresh samples were mixed with anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
Methanol was used as a modifier for the carbon dioxide fluid.
Extraction conditions were a pressure of 300 atm and a temperature
of 50C.  The authors recommend further development of this method
for the extraction of multiple residues.

A. Garcia-Valverde, A.R. Fernandez-Alba, A. Aguera, and M.
Contreras of the Pesticide Residue Research Group of the
Universidad de Almeria (Facultad de Ciencias Experimentales, Spain)
published "Extraction of Methamidophos Residues from Vegetables
with Supercritical Fluid Carbon Dioxide" in the Journal of the
Association of Official Analytical Chemistry [78(3), 867-873,
1995].

Synthetic Proteins
Behave Like BABS

Creative BioMolecules Inc. (35 South St., Hopkinton, MA; Tel:
508/435-9001) has been issued a patent for the development of a
family of synthetic proteins that have affinity for a preselected
antigen (U.S. No. 5,476,786). The Creative BioMolecules proteins
are characterized by one or more sequences of amino acids
constituting a region that behaves as a biosynthetic antibody
binding site (BABS). The sites comprise:

     non-covalently associated or disulfide bonded synthetic VH and
VL dimers,

     VH-VL or VL-VH single chains wherein the VH and VL are
attached by a polypeptide linker, or

     Individual VH or VL domains.

Antibodies are proteins belonging to a group of immunoglobulins
elicited by the immune system in response to a specific antigen or
substance that the body deems foreign. Antibodies can both
recognize and bind that antigen and are involved in a number of
effector reactions such as complement fixation and allergic
responses.

There are five classes of human antibodies that have the ability to
selectively recognize and preferentially bind a specific antigen.
Each antibody class has the same basic structure, or multiples
thereof, consisting of two identical polypeptides called heavy or
H chains (molecular weight in IgG approximately 50,000 d each) and
two identical polypeptides called light or L chains (molecular
weight approximately 25,000 d each).

Each of the five antibody classes has a similar set of light chains
and a distinct set of heavy chains. A light chain is composed of
one variable and one constant domain, while a heavy chain is
composed of one variable and three or more constant domains. The
variable domains determine the specificity of the immunoglobulin,
and the constant regions have other functions.

Amino acid sequence data indicate that each variable domain
comprises three hypervariable regions flanked by four relatively
conserved framework regions. The hypervariable regions have been
assumed to be responsible for the binding specificity of individual
antibodies and to account for the diversity of binding of
antibodies as a protein class.

Monoclonal antibodies, or homogeneous antibodies of identical
genetic parentage and binding specificity, have been useful both as
diagnostic and therapeutic agents. They are routinely produced
according to established procedures by hybridomas generated by
fusion of mouse lymphoid cells with an appropriate mouse myeloma
cell line.

Human monoclonal antibodies are difficult to produce by cell-fusion
techniques since, among other problems, human hybridomas are
notably unstable, and removal of immunized spleen cells from humans
is not feasible as it is for rodents. Monoclonals, which have
specificities of significant therapeutic value, are generally of
murine or rat origin, and are therefore immunogenic to the human
immune system.

The binding domains comprise linked CDR and FR regions, which may
be derived from separate immunoglobulins. The proteins may also
include other polypeptide sequences that function as an enzyme,
toxin, binding site, or site of attachment to an immobilization
media or radioactive atom. Methods are disclosed for producing the
proteins, for designing BABS having any specificity that can be
elicited by in vivo generation of antibody, and for producing
analogs thereof.

SELEX Method
Prepares Ligands

Larry Gold and Diane Tasset of Nextstar Pharmaceuticals Inc.
(Boulder, CO) have determined methods to identify nucleic acid
ligand solutions to thrombin (US Patent 5,476,766).  The invention
utilizes the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands for EXponential
enrichment) method for identifying and preparing RNA ligands to
thrombin.  Included are modified nucleotide sequences based on the
sequences of the RNA ligands identified. The modified RNA ligands
to thrombin exhibit increased in vivo stability.

Most proteins or small molecules are not known to specifically bind
to nucleic acids. The known protein exceptions are those regulatory
proteins such as repressors, polymerases, activators, and the like
that function in a living cell to bring about the transfer of
genetic information encoded in the nucleic acids into cellular
structures and the replication of the genetic material. Small
molecules such as GTP bind to some intron RNAs.

The individual components of proteins, the 20 natural amino acids,
possess sufficient chemical differences and activities to provide
an enormous breadth of activities for both binding and catalysis.
Nucleic acids, however, are thought to have narrower chemical
possibilities than proteins, but to have an informational role that
allows genetic information to be passed from virus to virus, cell
to cell, and organism to organism. In this context nucleic acid
components, the nucleotides, possess only pairs of surfaces that
allow informational redundancy within a Watson-Crick base pair.
Nucleic acid components need not possess chemical differences and
activities sufficient for either a wide range of binding or
catalysis.

Some nucleic acids found in nature do participate in binding to
certain target molecules and even a few instances of catalysis have
been reported. The range of activities of this kind is narrow
compared to proteins and more specifically antibodies.  Double-
stranded DNA has a well-known capacity to bind within the nooks and
crannies of target proteins whose functions are directed to DNA
binding. Single-stranded DNA can also bind to some proteins with
high affinity and specificity, although the number of examples is
smaller.

While not bound by a theory of preparation, systematic evolution of
ligands for exponential enrichment (SELEX) is based on the
inventors' insight that within a nucleic acid mixture containing a
large number of possible sequences and structures, there is a range
of binding affinities for a given target. A nucleic acid mixture
comprising, for example, a 20 nucleotide randomized segment can
have 420 candidate possibilities. Those that have the higher
affinity constants for the target are most likely to bind.

After partitioning, dissociation, and amplification, a second
nucleic acid mixture is generated, enriched for the higher binding
affinity candidates. Additional rounds of selection progressively
favor the best ligands until the resulting nucleic acid mixture is
predominantly composed of only one or a few sequences. These can be
cloned, sequenced, and individually tested for binding affinity as
pure ligands.

In many cases, it is not necessarily desirable to perform the
iterative steps of SELEX until a single nucleic acid ligand is
identified. The target-specific nucleic acid ligand solution may
include a family of nucleic acid structures or motifs that have a
number of conserved sequences and a number of sequences that can be
substituted or added without significantly effecting the affinity
of the nucleic acid ligands to the target. By terminating the SELEX
process prior to completion, it is possible to determine the
sequence of a number of members of the nucleic acid ligand solution
family.

Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease that has important
procoagulant and anticoagulant activities. As a procoagulant
enzyme, thrombin clots fibrinogen, activates clotting factors V,
VIII, and XIII, and activates platelets. The specific cleavage of
fibrinogen by thrombin initiates the polymerization of fibrin
monomers, a primary event in blood clot formation. The central
event in the formation of platelet thrombi is the activation of
platelets from the "pnonbinding"n to the "sbinding"d mode, and
thrombin is the most potent physiologic activator of platelet
aggregation.

As a procoagulant, thrombin plays a key role in the arrest of
bleeding (physiologic hemostasis) and formation of vasoocclusive
thrombi (pathologic thrombosis).  The formation of the thrombin-TM
complex converts thrombin from a procoagulant to an anticoagulant
enzyme, and the normal balance between these opposing activities is
critical to the regulation of hemostasis.

Chemical Sensor
Detects Reactions

Fisons plc (Ipswich, UK) and GEC Marfoni Ltd. (Ipswich, UK)  have
developed chemical sensors for detecting antibody-antigen binding
reactions (US Patent 5,478,756). The sensor is characterized in
that the surface of the piezoelectric support, including the region
bearing the electrode, is covered by a layer of dielectric material
of thickness 0.5 to 20 microns. The piezoelectric support is
preferably a single crystal. The dielectric layer may be of silicon
dioxide or a suitable polymer and preferably has a thickness of
between 0.5 and 5 microns.

Antibodies are molecules that protect an organism from disease
and/or infection. When an organism is exposed to an antigen, the
organism creates antibodies that provide binding sites to which the
antigen may be bound and immobilized.

Many known antibodies exist and can be used to detect specific
antigens. Detection of such antigens is effected by providing the
appropriate antibody and determining whether binding takes place.
For example, an antibody may be provided on a surface of a support,
the support may be immersed in a liquid thought to contain an
antigen, and a physical characteristic of the surface and/or the
support is monitored to determine if binding (indicative of the
presence of the antigen) has taken place.

One form of support that has been used is a piezo-electric crystal
in which surface acoustic waves (SAW) are generated. Binding of
antigen to antibody on the surface of the support is detected as a
decrease in wave velocity.

A problem that occurs with known SAW sensors is that considerable
penetration occurs if the acoustic wave into the environment is to
be sensed. If the environment is gaseous, this problem is not
unduly onerous. However, if (as is usually the case for analysis of
biologically originating samples) the environment is liquid, then
the penetration of the wave into the environment causes
considerable damping. This in turn reduces the sensitivity of the
device.

Devices have also been described that utilize shear horizontal
waves. These offer a number of advantages over SAW devices: 1) bulk
waves suffer lower propagation losses than SAW (under liquids); 2)
bulk waves have higher velocities and can therefore be used at
higher frequencies than SAW; and 3) bulk waves have superior
temperature coefficients to SAW in both quartz and LiTaO3. These
bulk wave devices suffer from the disadvantage of a limited mass
sensitivity due to poor surface energy confinement.

The new invention is an improved form of chemical sensor of
particular utility in the detection and/or determination of an
analyte species in a sample that is liquid, as is generally the
case for samples of biological origin, and that overcomes or
substantially mitigates the disadvantages associated with known SAW
and bulk wave devices.  The sensor is advantageous in that the
layer of dielectric material increases the coupling coefficient and
reduces the insertion loss of the wave. Also, and very importantly,
the device may be totally immersed in a liquid with little
attenuation occurring in the intensity of the guided surface wave.

Other advantages of the sensor according to the invention include
its relatively simple construction and the fact that the whole
surface of the device may be used for sensing, which increases the
sensitivity. The dielectric layer may also reduce the temperature
coefficient of delay. Further, by appropriate choice of dielectric
material, e.g. derivatized silica, the need for an adhesion layer
for the immobilization of reagents on the surface can be
eliminated.

The device, according to the invention, is conveniently a two-port
waveguide sensor having spaced-apart input and output electrodes.
Alternatively, the device may be a one-port resonator having a
single electrode with a reflective metallic grating on either side.
The gratings reflect the acoustic waves, a resonant cavity being
formed between the gratings. Also, the gratings affect mass loading
of the surface. For this latter purpose, a grating may be included
in the two-port device, between the input and output electrodes.

In use, the device is immersed in a liquid to be tested, or a drop
of liquid is applied to the surface of the layer of silicon
dioxide. If the liquid contains the species that binds with the
reagent immobilized on the surface of the layer, a change in mass
occurs at that surface. This slows the acoustic wave and alters the
phase of the output signal. The change in phase provides a
quantitative indication of the presence of the analyte in the
sample.

New Modified Laser
Fluorometric Detector

In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in capillary
electrophoresis (CE) for separations of a wide variety of
compounds.  The high efficiencies that can be obtained for most
separations are very beneficial and can alleviate some difficulties
associated with the separation of complex samples. Brian Clark and
Michael Sepaniak of the University of Tennessee (Dept. of
Chemistry, Knoxville, TN 37996-1600) published information on the
development and evaluation of modified capillary electrophoresis
instrumentation with laser fluorometric detection. This allows for
the convenient and precise translation of the detection zone along
the length of the separation column, according to the Journal of
Microcolumn Separations  [7(6), 593-601, 1995].

There are several anomalies that can limit efficiency and, hence,
resolution in CE.  Among these are anomalous effects associated
with electroosmotic flow, sample injection, temperature gradients,
and non-uniform field phenomena.  Investigations of the
aforementioned anomalies are difficult because detection is
commonly performed at a single detection point.  Many events that
can have a profound impact on the separation process and occur
prior to detection cannot be accurately studied.

There have been several attempts to develop instrumentation capable
of multi-point interrogation of separation systems.  Most involve
a high level of instrumental complexity and high cost due to the
use of several detectors in series. The development of a cost-
effective, experimentally simple device could benefit many
fundamental studies in CE, as well as address certain practical
problems associated with optimizing the signal/noise ratio and
minimizing separation time.

The newly developed instrumentation is used for fundamental studies
of band dispersion, analyte mobility alterations, sample stacking,
and the determination of diffusion coefficients.  The feasibility
of using this instrumentation to improve the signal/noise ratio and
decrease analysis time is presented.  DNA restriction digest
separations employing soluble polymer buffer systems with on-column
fluorescent labeling was used to illustrate the unique advantages
of this experimental design.

Continuous Separation
of Solids, Liquids

For the continuous separation of liquids and solids, TEMA has a
unique centrifuge called the Conturbex.  The Conturbex can handle
flow rates that range from 6 gpm to 440 gpm.  They also have a
solids-discharge capacity of up to 132,000 pounds per hour.  This
machine is capable of generating forces of more than 2,000 g's.
The Conturbex is used for particles in the 60 micron and above
range. Tema Systems (7806 Redsky Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45249-1632;
Tel: 513/489-7811, Fax: 513/489-4817) manufactures and services the
complete line of horizontal axis continuous centrifuges.

Tema also manufactures a Decanter centrifuge for particles in the
5-100 micron range, and on particles with a different specific
gravity than the mother liquid.  The Pusher centrifuge is used for
applications where a high amount of product washing is desired.
While the Conturbex also offers product washing, the Pusher
provides the highest amount of washing effect available in a
continuous centrifuge.

For applications that de-water very well, the Turbo-Cascade
sliding-discharge centrifuge is used.  This centrifuge works well
on particles of uniform size and will accommodate solids of
approximately 0.5 mm and larger.

Tema Systems is the exclusive North American manufacturer for
Siebtechnik design centrifuges.  Siebtechnik GmbH has been a
leading European manufacturer for more than 60 years.

Isothermal Method
Separates Zeolite Y

The changes in component concentrations in the liquid phase are
important for the nucleation and crystal growth of zeolite species
and have been reported by several researchers.  The greatest
portion of the liquid phase in the initial reaction mixture for
zeolites X and Y is involved in the gel phase, and the separable
amount of the liquid phase is significantly smaller than that from
the well-crystallized one.

Akira Yoshida of the Kyushu National Industrial Research Institute
(Inorganic Materials Dept., Shuku-machi, Tosu-shi, Saga-ken 841
Japan) has undertaken an analysis of the liquid phase during the
course of crystallization of zeolite Y using an isothermal
centrifugal separation technique.  Results of the study have been
published in Zeolites [15, 739-744, 1995].

Yoshida examined the concentrations of components in the liquid
phase during the course of crystallization using a centrifugal
reaction tube with an intermediate filter plate.  Using these
concentration data and the amount of dissoluble species from the
solid portion by washing, the component concentrations in the
nearest liquid layer to the surface of the solid portion were
estimated, and the amount of Na+ ions at the dangling bonds of
silicate structure were evaluated.

The first filtrate, which must have similar component
concentrations in the liquid phase obtained by the usual
filtration, has lower concentrations of silica and Na+ ions, and
consequently, a lower specific gravity than those in the other
filtrates.  The weight ratios of silica and sodium ions and the
Na/Si molar ratios in the second, third, and fourth filtrates were
nearly the same.

The Na/Si molar ratios in the nearest liquid layer was
conspicuously higher than those in the filtrates because of the
dissolution of Na+ ions from dangling bonds of the aluminosilicate
framework.  The washed solid portion also had excess Na+ ions.
These excess Na+ ions at the surface of growing crystals and
amorphous precursor decreased linearly with the increasing
crystallinity.

Westinghouse Isolates
Erbium Isotopes

A continuous, steady-state chromatography process for the
simultaneous separation of isotopes of erbium (Er) has been
prepared by scientists at Westinghouse Electric Corp. (Stanwix St.,
Pittsburgh, PA 15222; Tel: 412/244-2000).  Thomas S. Snyder reports
that an ion-exchange resin serves as the stationary phase, an
aqueous solution of ions based on a mixture of Er isotopes is the
feed phase, and an aqueous acid eluant solution is the mobile
phase.  The process involves the mobile-phase eluting or desorbing
the Er isotope solute adsorbed on the stationary phase under
conditions such that each of the naturally occurring isotopes of Er
is eluted in a distinct volume.

Er is used in nuclear fuel assembly designs as burnable poison with
a high neutron capture cross section.  Its overall characteristics
are comparable to those of boron.  Er's chemical properties are
similar to those of gadolinium (Gd) except that Er(III) is a
slightly more acidic ion than Gd(III) in solution.  As a result,
its separation chemistry should be more powerful than that of Gd in
similar eluents.

The key issue in the design of a system for Er isotopic enrichment
chemistry is that the important fractions of the high cross section
isotopes are embedded in undesirable isotopes.  This requires
multiple extraction trains when using separations technologies such
as solvent extraction or fixed-bed ion-exchange columns, which
produce "heads" and "tails" fractions but nothing in the "middle."


As a result, multiple trains are required to dissect the fractions
until the desired head or tail emerges from the column as the sole
constituent of the product fraction.  This enrichment problem,
coupled with the requirement for complex chemistry and hardware to
separate Er from ores, leads to several issues that must be
addressed by a process technology capable of recovering Er from raw
ore and refining it to an isotopically pure product for use in
nuclear fuel assembly design.

The separation of Er from other rare earth elements and impurities
in the ore leachate requires a large number of multistage
extraction circuits because of the relatively low specificity of
the distribution coefficients for most extraction solvents.  A
large number of large, awkward, and expensive stages per extraction
unit are required, and hazardous mixed wastes are generated as a
result of the organic solvents.  Peripheral purification operations
are also required to refine the Er and prepare it for isotopic
enrichment.

The new Westinghouse process uses a continuous annular
chromatograph.  Erbium oxide dissolved in an aqueous mineral acid
is fed to the chromatograph.  The stationary phase is a cation-
exchange resin, and the mobile phase is normally aqueous
hydrochloric acid.  Chelants, complexants or ligands may be added
to enhance the separation.  U.S. Patent 5,437,795 covers the
Westinghouse invention.

New Process
Purifies FDP

Anion-exchange chromatography can be used to purify fructose 1,6-
diphosphate (FDP), according to researchers at Unitika Ltd. (4-1-3
Kyutaro-Machi, Chuo-Ku, Osaka 541, Japan; Tel: 6-281-5712, Fax: 6-
281-5563).  After desalting, the resultant FDP is used in
pharmaceuticals, reports Tatsuo Katayama.

Several processes exist for the production of FDP.  One involves
its synthesis from glucose and phosphoric acid through the
fermentation of yeast cells.  Another technique uses glucose in the
presence of acetate kinase-containing cells or extracts, and acetyl
phosphate.  Additional purification is required to produce a
product of pharmaceutical-grade quality.

Although cation-exchange chromatography may be used, such a process
makes the FDP solution acidic.  Proteinous materials contained as
impurities in the solution are denatured and precipitated, and the
precipitate obstructs the passage of the FDP through the cation-
exchange column.  One alternative is to remove the proteinous
impurities from the FDP solution prior to the cation-exchange
treatment using heat or a hydrochloric acid-based technique.  The
problem with this approach is that during this pretreatment step
some of the FDP is also denatured and lost, reducing the final FDP
yield.

The Unitika scientists improved FDP yields by using anion-exchange
chromatography and a subsequent desalting separation such as
electrodialysis (ED) or reverse osmosis (RO). Suitable ED membranes
are manufactured from hydrocarbon-based, fluorine-containing  high
polymer materials.  Polyamides are normally used for the RO
membranes.  U.S. Patent 5,434,255 further details the Unitika work.

Large-Scale Method
Purifies Proteins

Advantages of immobilized metal affinity chromatography or IMAC
include the optimal control of ligand density.  Binding sites are
energetically homogeneous with respect to each adsorbing species,
and selectivity is high, producing 3000-fold purification in a
single step.  The separation of proteins can be achieved with
minimum denaturation, it is relatively easy to maintain sterile
conditions during operation, and solvents are cheap and
environmentally friendly.

Large-scale immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)
techniques intended for the purification of proteins and peptides
were devised by scientists at Purdue University (School of Chemical
Engineering, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1283; Tel: 317/494-4050).
Kamran Khan, Zidu Ma, Segal Patel, and N. H. Linda Wang report that
the research team determined the adsorption isotherms of imidazole,
His-Ala dipeptide, chicken egg-white lysozyme, and horse heart
myoglobin using single- and multiple-step frontal chromatography.

Protein adsorption in IMAC is a complicated process involving a
series of steric, chemical, kinetic, and thermodynamic variables.
It can be further complicated by multi-site binding and
heterogeneity in binding.  One of the more important quantities
needed for competition studies and understanding of the dynamic
adsorption behavior is the equilibrium adsorption isotherm.

Breakthrough curves under column overload conditions in high-
performance liquid chromatography can be used to obtain the
isotherm information.  Although direct measurement of the
competition between adsorbed molecules is complicated in IMAC
systems, studies on the maximum capacity of a protein in the
presence of imidazole at a constant concentration can provide
information on the competition as well as simplify data analysis.

In the Purdue research, the capacity for copper, or Cu(II), ions
was quantified.  Imadazole isotherm measurements were determined
for metal-charged and metal-free columns, and dipeptide isotherms
were measured.  The Purdue scientists described their work at the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) 1995 Annual
Meeting in Miami Beach, FL.

Multipurpose Device
Combines Operations

A multipurpose laboratory electrophoresis device built by Sumeet
and Kuldeep Verma (3509 Crofton Court, Raleigh, NC 27604; Tel:
919/878-6625) is said to combine several procedures in the same
apparatus, eliminating the need for moving a gel between analytic
jobs.  Electrophoresis, horizontal and vertical electroblotting
and/or electroelution, vacuum blotting, capillary blotting,
ultraviolet (UV) observation of ethidium bromide labeled specimens,
UV photography, and UV crosslinking may all be performed.  Features
of the apparatus include buffer circulation, light opaque
enclosure, DNA band compaction, and DNA elution without cutting the
DNA band.

Gel electrophoresis remains a key analytical tool in molecular
biology and clinical sciences.  The electrophoresis of DNA and
other organic molecules under the influence of an electric field
involves the casting of a semisolid gel of agarose or
polyacrylamide in a mold to produce a thin, rectangular slab.
Wells, or depressions, are formed in the upper surface of the slab
along a line at one end.  The gel slab is placed in chamber with
electrodes at each end, and the chamber is filled with a buffer
solution to a level higher than the gel.  Some wells are filled
with a solution containing the sample, and a high-gradient electric
field is applied to the gel through the buffer solution.  The
molecules in the sample separate into bands by migrating through
the gel slab toward the oppositely charged electrodes at different
rates depending on their mobility, a function of molecular charge
density and size.

Gels are fragile.  Manipulation can rip or distort them, resulting
in unreliable test results.  The usefulness of electrophoresis
depends on producing thin, well-defined molecular sample bands.
Such definition depends partially on the manner in which the
molecular sample migrates from the sample well along the gel.

The sample well, the distribution of the sample in the well, and
the electric field influence band definition.  A sample once
deposited in a well migrates horizontally through the gel as a
vertically oriented rectangle.  The sides of the sample rectangle
tend to migrate slower than the central portion, resulting in a U-
shaped dispersed band.  A macromolecular sample deposited in the
front corner of the well migrates horizontally as a compact line
through a comparatively small volume of gel, resulting in narrow,
straight, well-defined bands.  An operator must exercise extreme
care in loading the sample to obtain a well-defined band.  The
problem is that, despite such care, electrophoretic results are
often diminished by the presence of U-shaped, dispersed,
macromolecular sample bands.

The new device, fully described in U.S. Patent 5,449,446, is a
single, integrated apparatus capable of the execution of molecular
separation in a gel, subsequent molecular transfer to a membrane,
and photography of the results.  The unit includes a power source,
an electrophoresis-electroblot-transilluminator, a viewing hood, a
camera hood, and UV-radiation sources for sample detection and
crosslinking.

The unit can horizontally separate sample molecules within a gel
and the subsequent vertical or horizontal transfer of the molecules
to an adjacent membrane by electroblotting, capillary-blotting, or
vacuum-blotting techniques.  The UV-radiation source irradiates the
gel to cause fluorescence of the sample.  The UV-radiation source
crosslinks the separated sample to the membrane.

Assay Offers In
Vitro Evaluation

The gel mobility shift assay is a useful tool for rapid and
economical evaluation of chemicals in vitro for DNA-damaging or
promoter effects.  The Molecular Toxicology Group at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory has investigated the risks of human exposure to
radiation and chemicals using the newest molecular biology-based
procedures.  The group identifies new biomarkers, designs and
evaluates new in vitro assays.

Advances in the molecular biology of cancer are providing a unique
opportunity to design more reliable assays to evaluate human health
risks.  These assays can provide rapid, economical, and reliable
evaluation of the potential carcinogenicity of genotoxic and non-
genotoxic chemicals.

DNA-damaging and cancer chemotherapeutic agents increase p53-DNA
site-specific finding in treated cells.  The Oak Ridge scientists
conducted p53-gel mobility shift assays on NOVEX (11040 Roselle
St., San Diego, CA 92121-1222; Tel: 800/456-6839 or 619/452-6634,
Fax: 619/452-6635) 6% DNA Retardation Gels to identify chemicals
that damage DNA or affect enzymes that modify DNA.  Cells are
treated with a suspected DNA-damaging agent for a short time (two
to four hours).  The cells are lysed and extracts containing p53
are incubated with the [32P]-end labeled p53 consensus binding
sequence.  Gel mobility shift assays are performed on NOVEX 6% DNA
retardation gels with 1/2x TBE as the running buffer.

Chemicals that mimic estrogen's growth-stimulating activities have
been called environmental estrogens or xenoestrogens.  Estrogen-
like promoters can be identified using gel-mobility shift assays.
For example, pesticides, dyes, and pollutants increase binding of
the estrogen receptor (ER) to the estrogen response element (ERE).
The ER-ERE complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a NOVEX
6% DNA retardation gel.  Human breast cells treated with estrogen
or DDT show increased amounts of ER complexed to the ERE;
therefore, gel-mobility shift assays performed on NOVEX pre-cast
gels can rapidly identify potential environmental estrogens.

The use of NOVEX pre-cast gels for these procedures simplifies the
assay, makes them more user friendly, and decreases the time
required to perform them.

Pall Changes
IV Concept

A new concept in intravenous (IV) fluid filtration has been
developed by Pall Biomedical Products Co. (25 Harbor Park Drive,

In addition to its clinical benefits, the DUO96 filter provides
cost savings.  When the Pall IV filter is used, the interval for
routine IV set change can be extended up to 96 hours, resulting in
a reduction in set use and costs.  Nursing time associated with
intravenous administration (set changes, restarts, and problem

Osmonics Holding
More of the Dirt

Increased dirt-holding capacity (DHC) or contaminant loading of
filters has been a continuous goal of filter manufacturers and a
continuous desire of filter users.  This is because increased DHC
results in more economical filtration.  However, it is difficult to
achieve higher DHC without compromising the efficiency of the
filter.

Most filter manufacturers have devised increasing DHC by improving
the filter media.  The amount any filter medium can hold is
directly proportional to the void volume or open area in the media.
Over the years, millions of dollars have been spent on developing
media that will hold more contaminant.  It is a difficult task
because in any given medium, if you increase the void volume, you
decrease contaminant-removal efficiency.

To increase DNC without compromising removal efficiency,
manufacturers have altered the structure of the media.  Despite
using finer fibers, greater loft, more entanglement, and multiple
layers, or by forming asymmetric pores and creating greater pore
density, filter media manufacturers have been able to achieve only
modest increases in DNC.

Spiraltek rolled-cartridge filters from Osmonics (5951 Clearwater
Drive, Minnetonka, MN  55343;  Tel: 612/933-2277,  Fax: 612/933-
0141) represent a new concept in filtration.  The filter was
developed using a knowledge of crossflow technology.  In crossflow
filtration, the media is continuously cleaned by the process fluid
that flows across the media surface.  The fluid flow is
mechanically restricted downstream, such that a portion of the flow
passes through the media, while the remainder passes beyond the
restriction. The portion that did not go through the media contains
a concentrated level of contaminant.

Spiraltek filters employ the basics of crossflow filtration, but
the downstream restriction is entirely closed.  The result is a
fluid flow that continuously cleans the media surface without a
secondary stream containing concentrated contaminant.  As
contaminant is pushed towards the sealed end of the filter, the
contaminant packs against itself in a non-porous section of the
filter.  Restriction to flow increases very slowly and the filter
operates steadily for a longer period of time.  The end result is
less dependence on the void volume of the media for increased DNC
and a quantum increase in DNC based on the filter construction.

The new filters have been successfully applied in the field and
subjected to unbiased, head-to-head comparison testing.  Test
results show that Spiraltek filters hold three to six times more
contaminant per square foot of filter media when compared to other
pleated filters.

5.5 Million ChiRex
Shares Offered

Sepracor Inc. (33 Locke Drive, Marlborough, MA  01752;  Tel:
508/481-6700, Fax: 508/481-7683) and Sterling Organics Ltd.
(Sterling Place, Dudley, Cramlington, Northumberland NE23 7QG, UK),
a fine-chemical company, will join forces to create a new chiral
technology company, ChiRex Inc.

The two companies jointly announced the filing by ChiRex Inc. of a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
relating to a proposed offering of 5,500,000 shares of ChiRex
common stock.  Net proceeds from the proposed offering will be used
to combine Sepracor Inc.'s chiral chemistry business, which is
conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SepraChem Inc., with
Sterling Organics' in a newly-formed U.S. company.  The offering
will be managed by CS First Boston, Lehman Brothers, and Smith
Barney Inc.  The S-1 has been filed with a proposed maximum
offering price of $16.50 per share.

ChiRex Inc. will combine SepraChem's chiral chemistry process
technology with Sterling Organics' large-scale chemical
manufacturing capability.  SepraChem, established in 1994, supplies
Sepracor and pharmaceutical companies with chiral pharmaceutical
intermediates and active ingredients.

The business of Sterling Organics was established in the 1960s to
manufacture pharmaceutical intermediates for Sterling Winthrop Ltd.
(4 New Horizons Court, Harlequin Ave., Brentford, Middlesex  TW8
9EP, UK), of which it was a division.  Eastman Kodak Co. (343 State
St., Rochester, NY  14650; Tel: 716/724-4000,  Fax: 716/477-3681)
sold Sterling Winthrop to Sanofi Winthrop (1 Onslow St., Guilford,
Surrey  GU1 4YS, UK) in September 1994, which in turn sold the
Sterling Organics operation to a group consisting of Sterling
Organics management investors and Montagu Private Equity Ltd., the
European private equity arm of the HSBC Group (10 Lower Thames St.,
London EC3R 6AE, UK).

Following the offering, ChiRex is expected to have approximately
9.8 million shares outstanding, of which Sepracor is expected to
own approximately 38%.

Sugar-Containing
Solutions Softened

A cation-exchange resin-based process for softening aqueous
solutions such as sugar juice or molasses has been investigated.
Michael Saska of the Louisiana State University (LSU, Chemical
Engineering Dept., Baton Rouge, LA 70803; Tel: 504/388-3327)
reports that the sugar cane and sugar beet industries produce large
quantities of non-crystallizable sugar juice, or "sugar factory
molasses."  This molasses has a high sugar content and is treated
to extract the sugars.

Such conventional treatment involves subjecting the molasses to an
ion-exclusion chromatography process using a fixed support of a
strong sodium (Na) or potassium (K) cation resin.  The problem is
that magnesium (Mg) and/or calcium (Ca) salts dissolved in the
molasses and, as charged Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ ions, replace the Na+ and
K+ ions during the chromatography operation, reducing the
separating power of the technique.  As a result, the chromatography
operation is interrupted periodically to regenerate the cation
resin.

Regeneration reagent is consumed, and productivity is reduced.  One
approach to overcome the problem involves the elimination of the
Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ ions prior to the chromatography step.  Such a
technique also requires the use of a regeneration reagent and has
the additional disadvantage of producing wastewater-containing
sugar, reducing the yield from the overall process.

In the new process, the sugar juice is softened by bringing it into
contact with Na+ and/or K+ cation-exchange resins in a conventional
manner.  The key to the new technique is the regeneration part of
the process, which makes clever use of one of the liquid effluents
in a sugar factory.  The raffinate generated during the
chromatographic separation and charged with Na+ and/or K+ ions is
normally discarded.  The researchers concentrated the raffinate and
used it to regenerate the resin used in the primary separation.
U.S. Patent 5,443,650 covers the new technique.

Japanese Team Turns
Attention to Lithium

Researchers at the Shikoku National Industrial Research Institute
(2217-14 Hayashi-cho, Takamatsu 761-03, Japan) and Sophia
University (7-1 Kioicho, Chiyodaku, Tokyo 102, Japan) have studied
lithium isotope fractionation properties on five kinds of inorganic
ion exchangers with different ion-sieve properties.

Because of its low nuclear cross section for thermal neutrons, 7Li
is useful for the control of corrosion and the pH of coolant waters
in nuclear reactors.  Lithium isotope fractionation by two-phase
chemical exchange has been extensively studied in systems with a
lithium amalgam, lithium metal, an ion-exchange resin, and a
macrocyclic polyether.  However, there have been only a small
number of studies on lithium isotope fractionation with inorganic
ion exchangers since the first pioneer work by Tayler and Urey with
aluminosilicate.

Inorganic ion exchangers have attracted attention owning to their
remarkably high selectivity for certain metal ions or groups of
ions.  The specific characteristics of inorganic ion exchangers
arise partly from their rigid structure, which undergoes little
swelling or shrinking in the aqueous phase.  This brings about a
strong steric effect or an ion-sieve effect for various ions,
depending on the hydrated or dehydrated size of the adsorbing ions.

In the Shikoku/Sophia study, published in Separation Science and
Technology [30(20), 3761-3770, 1995], the lithium isotope
separation factors were determined batchwise in a LiOH or (LiCl +
LiOH) solution at 25C or 20C, respectively.  The separation
factor increased in the order birnessite-type manganese oxide <
hollandite-type manganese oxide <spinel-type manganese oxides <
cubic antiomonic acid in the LiOH solution.

It was dependent on the pore radius of the ion sieve.  The
difference in the separation factor could be well explained by
considering two factors; the difference in hydration circumstances
of Li+ between the ion exchanger and the solution phase, and the
influence of Li+ stabilization in the solid phase.

Characterization of
SPLITT's Personality

SPLITT fractionation (SF) is a relatively new family of separation
techniques primarily, but not exclusively, applicable to
macromolecules and particles.  The efficacy of SF requires an
absence of hydrodynamic mixing between laminae constituting the
thin liquid film streaming through a SPLITT cell, and it requires
structural elements capable of splitting the film evenly along
streamplanes.  These requirements were examined, both
experimentally and by numerical analysis of flow properties near
the inlet splitter, by a team including C. Bor Fuh, Edward M.
Trujillo, and J. Calvin Giddings of the University of Utah (Salt
Lake City, UT 84112).

As reported in Separation Science and Technology [30(20), 3861-
3876, 1995], the SF techniques utilize a thin ribbon-shaped flow
cell and achieve fractionation by differential transport across the
thin (transverse) axis of the cell.  Since the cell is only a few
hundred microns thick, the separation path (which cannot exceed but
may be less than the channel thickness) is extremely short and
separative transport is correspondingly rapid.  Separation is
typically accomplished in only a few minutes.  This is a
particularly valuable feature for fragile biological species that
must be fractionated rapidly to avoid degradation.

SF is capable of continuous operation and is thus useful as a
preparative technique for processing gram, kilogram, or larger
quantities of materials.  The separation is rigorously controlled
by adjusting the two inlet flow rates and the two outlet flow rates
and, in some cases, by altering the strength of the field or
gradient driving the separative transport.  The simplicity of the
SPLITT cell leads to rather rigorous theoretical guidelines on the
conditions necessary to achieve a given level of separation.

The principal transverse driving forces used in SPLITT cells
include gravity, centrifugation, diffusion, and electrical
potential gradients.  However, except for moderate curvature in the
centrifugal SPLITT cell, the geometry of the different cells is
similar.

Among the various topics explored by the University of Utah team,
the one of greatest practical interest is the partial delineation
of a range of flow conditions in which SPLITT fractionation can be
carried out without concern for hydrodynamic disturbances.  The
ability to achieve effective fractionation under these conditions
is supported by experimental results showing that SPLITT cell
performance is in reasonable agreement with theory.

This work also begins to answer the question of how far flow
conditions can be pushed before fractionation is degraded by
hydrodynamic disturbances.  A tentative boundary has been found for
both squared-off splitter edges and tapered edges such that
performance at higher Reynolds numbers and flow asymmetries is
suspect.  Performance beyond these boundaries has not been
significantly tested.

Technetium from
Alkaline Solutions

Technetium (Tc) can be extracted from alkaline solutions of nuclear
waste using a new process formulated by scientists at the
Department of Energy (DOE).  The technique involves contacting the
solution with a solvent containing a crown ether in a diluent.  The
technetium-containing solvent is separated from the solution, and
the Tc is then stripped from the solvent, reports Bruce A. Moyer.

Fission products resulting from the irradiation of nuclear reactor
fuels require long-term storage in an insoluble form.  About 1.8
metric tons of technetium is contained in 60 million gallons of
high-level radioactive wastes stored at Hanford, WA.  These wastes
are highly alkaline, with a pH of at least 13, and are concentrated
in alkali metal nitrates, such as sodium nitrate.  Removal of Tc
from such wastes is a good idea because of safety considerations
and the environmental problems associated with its long-term
storage. These wastes provide a resource from which Tc can be
recovered for experimental uses.

Although crown ethers have previously been considered for the
extraction of technetium under alkali conditions, the impact of
high concentrations of alkali metal nitrates on the distribution
coefficient of technetium has not been addressed.  The DOE
researchers found that the concentration of sodium nitrate in the
waste solution plays a key role in determining the efficiency of
extraction and stripping.  Suitable diluents for use in the DOE
process include aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon, ketone,
pyridine, ether, nitrile, phosphoryl, or alcohol solvents that are
water immiscible and inert.  The technique is covered in U.S.
Patent 5,443,731.

BIOMEDICAL ETHICS IN U.S. PUBLIC POLICY

This (government issued) report covers biomedical
ethics in U.S. public policy.  It briefly reviews the
history of biomedical ethics and examines its potential
importance in public policymaking.  The report then
addresses: concerns about the many bioethical issues
that have not been analyzed at the federal level; the
prospect that these issues will arise more often in the
future; and the lack of a national institution to
explore the role of biomedical ethics in U.S. public
policy.

PLANNING WORKSHOP FOR DOE's ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL
TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE

The DOE has made major contributions in the biomedical
sciences with programs in medical applications,
instrumentation development, molecular biology, human
genome, and computational sciences.  In an effort to
help determine DOE's role in applying these
capabilities to the nation's health care needs, a
planning workshop was held (Jan. 11-12, 1994).  This
(DOE) document reviews the workshop, attended by
representatives of industry, medical research
institutions, national laboratories, and government
agencies.  The participants: defined the needs of the
health care industry; identified DOE laboratory
capabilities that address these needs; and determined
how DOE, in cooperation with other team members, could
begin an initiative having the goal of reducing health
care costs while improving the quality of health care
delivery through the proper application of technology
and computations systems.  Seven major technology
development thrust areas were considered, each
involving development of various aspects of imaging,
optical, sensor, data processing, and storage
technologies: (1) minimally invasive procedures; (2)
technologies for individual self care; (3) outcomes
research; (4) telemedicine; (5) decision support
systems; (6) assistive technology; (7) prevention and
education.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL COMPANY INNOVATIONS IN
BIOTECHNOLOGY

This work (by Bio-En-Gene-Er Associates) was undertaken
to help small businesses get on the fast track in
biotechnology research and development leading to the
spin-off of viable commercial businesses, probably with
the help of larger companies having the resources for
commercialization that are lacking in a small
enterprise.  Such resources could include financing and
positions in marketing, manufacturing, regulatory
affairs, and raw material supply.  In general,
biotechnology can be expected to have a major impact on
fundamental human needs engendered in the market
segments of: health care; agriculture; forestry; food
ingredients; industrial chemicals; plastics; energy;
mining; pollution control; and bioelectronics.

HIGH IMPACT-STRENGTH POLY(LACTIDE), A TOUGH
BIODEGRADABLE MATERIAL FOR MEDICAL AND OTHER USES

This translation of a Doctoral thesis from the
Netherlands (Groningen Rijksuniversiteit) covers
research on poly(lactide) aimed at gaining more insight
into the factors that determine the physical properties
and the applicability of these biodegradable polymers
in biomedical devices.  An important aspect is the
preparation of strong and tough amorphous materials
able to degrade in the human body by hydrolysis, to
yield harmless compounds.  The materials are primarily
designed for use as bone plates and screws in
maxillofacial surgery, but many other uses in medicine
and other fields are conceivable.  Materials based on
L-lactide are prepared by copolymerization with several
other cyclic esters, by blending amorphous
poly(lactide) polymers with degradable rubbers, and by
synthesizing block copolymers containing poly(lactide)
sequences.  Fundamental problems relating the
poly(lactide) chain stiffness and configuration in the
melt to the observed fracture behavior are addressed,
as well as more practical problems such as the
influence of processing variables on the properties of
poly(lactide).

STRUCTURE MODIFICATIONS AND FUNCTIONS OF PEPTIDE 6A FOR
INCREASING CORONARY PERFUSION FLOW

This translation from China (Beijing Medical
University) concerns structure modifications and
functions of Peptide 6A (P6A), one of the products
degraded from fibrinogen beta chain, that can increase
coronary perfusion flow (CPF) and inhibit thrombosis
significantly.  In this work, P6A was selected as the
lead compound and the residue Ala(sup 1) was
substituted.  Thus, the derivatives Lys(sup 1), Arg(sup
1), Asp(sup 1), Asn(sup 1), Glu(sup 1), Gin(sup 1) and
Gly(sup 1)-P6A were synthesized.  The bioassay
indicates that the substitution of amino acid with
acidic or basic side chain at position 1 of P6A will
decrease the vasodilation of P6A, and the substitution
of amino acid with amide side chain at this position of
P6A may increase the activity significantly.

THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF WOOD SMOKE

This report from Canada (by the British Columbia Office
of the Provincial Health Officer) reviews and
summarizes the scientific evidence relevant to an
assessment of the human health effects of wood smoke.
It identifies the components of wood smoke that are
present in concentrations high enough to have adverse
effects on health, as well as the range of
concentrations of these wood smoke components measured
in various settings.  It summarizes up-to-date human
health data on the three components of wood smoke that
are most significant with response to health, and
reviews health studies that directly evaluate the
associations between wood smoke exposure and ill
health.  The report then formulates some conclusions
about the health effects of wood smoke.

ALCOHOL USE, ABUSE, AND ALCOHOLISM

Alcohol is a drug with potentially devastating effects
on the human body.  While no less dangerous than many
illegal drugs, society has accepted alcohol's negative
consequences.  Growing evidence indicates that alcohol
abuse and alcoholism jeopardize our economic base
through a loss of human resources, with a potentially
negative long-term impact on our nation's security.
Increased corporate and governmental focus is being
placed on prevention and rehabilitation.  This
(Industrial College of the Armed Forces) paper provides
a history of alcohol use and abuse, discusses the
characteristics of alcohol, and examines the economic
costs to American society.  It reviews the process of
abuser identification as well as the treatment programs
available in the military and civilian workforce.
Observations and recommendations are provided.

GENERATION OF TRANSGENIC CASSAVA HAVING REDUCED CYANIDE
TOXICITY

Cassava plants possess a cyanide toxicity that is
harmful to humans.  In fact, a correlation has been
demonstrated between the cyanide content of poorly
processed cassava and the occurrence of the
neurological disorder called Konzo.  This (Ohio State
University) report describes genetic research designed
to develop cassava plants having reduced cyanide
toxicity.  The strategy is to isolate and overexpress
the gene encoding linamarase, the enzyme that converts
linamarin into acetone cyanohydrin.  Most of the
research objectives are achieved, and some are even
expanded upon.  (This 1990 report was only recently
released for public use.)

Fuel Cell Material
Attracts DuPont

DuPont (Wilmington, DE 19898; Tel: 800/441-7515) scientists have
produced a composite fluorinated ion exchange membrane intended for
use as a separator in fuel cells and as a selective barrier in
permeation separation and facilitated transport processes.  Shoibal
Banerjee reports that the membrane attains greater mechanical
strength than conventional materials used for such applications
without sacrificing other required qualities.  The DuPont membrane,
which includes a fluorinated ion exchange polymer film bonded to a
porous hydrocarbon substrate, is nonporous to the bulk flow of
fluids but permits ions, especially cations, to move across its
structure.

In electrochemical cells, such as electrolytic cells or fuel cells,
it is important to provide a separator between the anode and
cathode compartments.  Chemically stable ion exchange membranes
made from perfluorosulfonic acid polymers are used, particularly
for the electrolysis of brine. DuPont's trademarked Nafion membrane
is a well recognized membrane of this type.

Quality, safety, efficiency, and cost effectiveness considerations
specify that fuel cell separators should be tear, abrasion,
puncture, and scratch resistant.  On the other hand, they should
not be so thick and/or reinforced that they are resistant to ionic
conduction or power requirements are excessively high.

Membrane resistance can be reduced by decreasing the membrane
thickness and increasing its water content.  The problem is that
along with a reduction in electrical resistance, this brings about
a big reduction in membrane strength.  Mechanical strength in
electrochemical cells is important.

Many fuel cells operate at high differential pressures, which
increase the likelihood of damage to the membranes.  Fuel cells
used in motor vehicles are subject to multiple shutdown and startup
procedures, and this cycling leads to membrane dehydration and
rehydration.  The resultant stress further increases the likelihood
of damage to the membrane.

Reinforced ion exchange membranes are also used to separate
mixtures of fluids with different permeation rates.  Such membranes
are often wound with macroporous meshes which permit the free flow
of fluids to and from the membrane surfaces.  Thin perfluoroionomer
films have high permeability to water and other polar molecules,
but effective permeation separation modules cannot be manufactured
from these thin, fragile materials.

Facilitated transport is a related separation technique in which a
continuous membrane is plasticized or swollen with a liquid.  The
dissolved liquid complexes with one of the fluids to be separated
and selectively facilitates its transport across the membrane.
Although perfluoroionomer offer advantages in some of these
applications, e.g., the separation of amino acids in aqueous media,
they do not have enough strength to undergo module construction or
to withstand operating pressure differentials.

The porous substrate of the DuPont membrane is made from a linear
high density polyethylene (LHDPE) polyolefin hydrocarbon woven or
nonwoven fabric with a melting point below 220(C.  The bond between
the substrate and the fluorinated polymer is formed by applying a
solvent to the surface of the substrate and then adding the
substrate.  The ion exchange polymer, a perfluorosulfonate or
perfluorocarboxylate, is solubilized by the solvent and flows into
and adheres to the pores of the substrate.  Suitable solvents
include aliphatic alcohols, perfluorinated aromatic compounds, and
perfluorotrialkylamines.

The DuPont composite membrane could be used as a reinforced thin
selective barrier in chemical separations, providing mechanical
strength without sacrificing low resistance to the selective
transport characteristics inherent in a thin perfluoro ion exchange
membrane.  The membrane may be used as an electrolytic separator
between anode and cathode compartments in a fuel cell.  It may also
be used as a thin, continuous barrier in permeation separations and
in facilitated transport operations.  The fabric provides
mechanical support and the spaces between the fibers provide
avenues for fluids to pass to and from the surface of the membrane
without sacrificing the high permeation rates to water and other
hydrophilic materials.  U.S. Patent 5,447,636 fully outlines the
DuPont work.

Zeroing in on an
Economic Discharge

Scientists from Bechtel Power Corp. (Doswell Combined Cycle
Facility, Rte. 4, P.O. Box 1643, Ashland, VA 23005), Resources
Conservation Co. (3006 Northup Way, Bellevue, WA 98004; Tel:
206/828-2400) and Ionics Inc. (5455 Garden Grove Blvd., No. 321,
Westminster, CA 92683) have been working on the integration of
membrane processes with evaporation to achieve economical zero
liquid discharge at the Doswell Combined Cycle Facility.  The
results of this study were published in Desalination (102, 81-86,
1995).

New restrictive permitting, operating and environmental
requirements placed on independent power producers, utility power
plants, chemical processing plants, refineries and other industrial
installations are mandating zero liquid discharge of wastewater to
sewers, rivers, deep wells and the like.  Economic reclamation and
reuse of wastewater is becoming essential.

Since the mid-70s, vapor compression evaporation has been a
preferred means to achieve zero liquid discharge.  Evaporation
recovers about 95% of a wastewater as distillate for reuse.  Waste
brine can be reduced to solids in a crystallizer/dewatering device.
However, evaporation alone can be an expensive option when flow
rates are large or when wastewater is not extremely high in total
dissolved solids (TDS).  As a result, grassroots power plants and
other industrial facilities often find it difficult to economically
justify a zero liquid discharge system.

One way to solve this problem is to integrate membrane processes
with evaporation.  By combining membrane processes such as
electrodialysis reversal (EDR) and/or reverse osmosis (RO) with
evaporation, the synergism makes zero liquid discharge an easier
goal to achieve.

An example of this hybrid approach for economical zero liquid
discharge is the installation of EDR plus RO along with evaporation
and crystallization at the Doswell combined Cycle Power Plant in
Hanover County, VA.  Use of membrane processes to preconcentrate
and reclaim plant wastewaters has significantly reduced the
evaporator feed volume, resulting in a 62% downsizing of the
evaporator system.

Without the EDR and RO system, the evaporator/crystallizer system
would have treated 250 gallons per minute of wastewater at a total
dissolved solids concentration of 2900 parts per million.  Using
the combined EDR and RO systems to pretreat wastewater helped
reduce the evaporator feed volume to about 90 gpm with a higher TDS
concentration of 9700 ppm.  Compared to straight
evaporation/crystallization, the hybrid approach reduced overall
capital costs by $900,000 and saves energy and operating costs by
$680 per operating day.

Lea Ronal's New
H3PO2 Acid Method

Lea Ronal Inc. (272 Buffalo Ave., Freeport, NY 11520; Tel: 516/868-
8800, Fax: 516/868-8774) has been issued a patent for electrolytic
production of phosphinic (hypophosphorous) acid (U.S. 5,480,517).
Hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2) or phosphinic acid, is a staple acid
of commerce and is sold for uses such as the manufacture of
hypophosphite salts, as well as to prevent the discoloration of
phosphate esters, in esterification catalysts, and for the
manufacture of cooling water treatment chemicals. H3PO2 finds use
in metal finishing procedures, as a reducing agent for electroless
plating, and as a sealer for phosphated steel.

The manufacture of hypophosphorous acid has generally been carried
out by somewhat complex and expensive methods utilizing ion
exchange procedures. In these procedures the sodium ion of sodium
hypophosphite is exchanged for a hydrogen ion using an ion exchange
resin therefor. These procedures result in hypophosphorous acid
being a rather expensive commodity, generally at over $7.00 per
pound.

Electrodialysis is also a known process which has been utilized for
various purposes. Alkali salt-containing aqueous solutions with
salts and complexes of metal anions and cations can be fed to the
catholyte, and the metal cations are removed as insoluble
hydroxides by controlling the pH therein. In this process, the
anions are transported across an anion permeable membrane into the
anolyte, where they are converted to acids or halogens.

It is of interest to develop a novel and more economical method for
producing hypophosphorous acid. Lea Ronal's method for preparing
hypophosphorous acid comprises electrodialysis using anionic and
cationic exchange membranes to convert hypophosphite salts, such as
alkali metal hypophosphite salts, into hypophosphorous acid and
alkali hydroxide. These results are achieved by conducting
electrodialysis through an insoluble anode and an anolyte
comprising hypophosphite ions and a cathode and a catholyte
comprising alkali (sodium) ions. Electrolysis of the water supplies
hydrogen ions to the anolyte and hydroxyl ions to the catholyte.

Palladium Composite
Removes Hydrogen

A hydrogen selective palladium-ceramic composite membrane designed
by researchers at Oregon State University (OSU, Corvallis, OR
97331; Tel: 541/737-0123) is one more attempt to overcome the
problems associated with conventional membranes intended for the
separation of hydrogen from gas mixtures at high temperatures and
pressures.  John P. Collins and J. Douglas Way formed the new
membrane described in U.S. Patent 5,451,386, from a porous,
tubular, asymmetric ceramic support with pore sizes in excess of 10
nanometers (nm).  The scientists deposited a layer of palladium 10-
20 microns thick on the inside surface of the ceramic support.

Numerous industrial processes require the selective removal of
hydrogen from a reaction media, e.g., the production of hydrogen by
decomposing ammonia and recovering hydrogen from the resultant
mixture.  Key factors in this process are the temperature and
pressure of the reaction mixture.  It can be difficult to separate
a gas from a mixture at high temperatures and pressures using
conventional packed bed reactors because high concentrations of
hydrogen and nitrogen favor the formation of ammonia.

The three materials commonly used in membranes to remove hydrogen
are polymers; metals or metal alloys, e.g., palladium or palladium
alloys; and ceramics.  Each has problems that restrict
effectiveness in separating the hydrogen.  Polymers have low
thermal and mechanical strength.  Metal and metal alloy membranes
are impractical for use on a commercial scale because of high cost,
low hydrogen flux, and a tendency to deform at high temperatures.
Ceramics can resist high temperatures and pressures, but they allow
mixtures of ammonia, hydrogen, and nitrogen to filter through the
membrane showing low selectivity.

The OSU composite membrane can selectively remove hydrogen from gas
mixtures at pressures in the 500(C range and transmembrane
pressures of about 1,500 kPa.  The hydrogen-to-nitrogen selectivity
is about 600.

The membranes are produced in a four-step process that includes the
use of sensitizing, activating, and plating solutions;
pretreatment; activation; and plating.  First, the ceramic tubes
are placed in a sensitizing bath which deposits a layer of
colloidal tin ions on their inside surfaces.  Solutions of tin (IV)
chloride pentahydrate and tin (II) chloride dihydrate are used to
make the sensitizing bath.  Second, the activating bath, a solution
of palladium chloride, deposits a uniform layer of finely dispersed
palladium crystals on the ceramic membrane surfaces.  The third
bath, which involves a tetramine palladium chloride complex, is the
source of the activated palladium metal applied to the structure.

Air Products Offers
a Radiation Cure

John Kaiser and Diwakar Garg of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.
(7201 Hamilton Blvd., Allentown, PA 18195; Tel: 610/481-4911) have
discovered a method of producing a low-cost, nitrogen-based inert
atmosphere suitable for radiation curing of resins, coatings, etc.
(U.S. Patent 5,480,682).  Residual oxygen present in non-
cryogenically generated nitrogen is converted to either moisture or
a mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide by reaction with a
reducing gas in a catalytic reactor prior to using the nitrogen-
based atmosphere for radiation curing of moisture insensitive
materials such as resins and coatings.

Radiation curing is a chemical manufacturing process which utilizes
electromagnetic radiation energy to change the chemical and
physical nature of organic chemical materials by cross-linking,
polymerizing, drying, solidifying or degrading polymer network.
Radiation curing processes are commercially applied today for
adhesives, abrasives, release coatings, metal coatings, overprint
coatings, flooring, wood finishing, food and perfume packaging,
printing, photopolymer plates, electronics, dental and medical
applications, magnetic media, fiber optics, lithography, etc.

The primary sources of radiation for radiation curing include
electron beam (e-beam), infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), and laser.
It is generally known that a part of radiation energy used for
curing resins and coatings is converted to heat during curing,
causing an increase in the atmosphere temperature. It is known that
an increase in the atmosphere temperature will raise the
temperature of the coating being cured, which can damage the
coating or result in cured coating with some undesirable
properties. It is, therefore, desirable to carefully control the
temperature of both the atmosphere and the coating being cured to
obtain optimum material properties.

Overheating of the atmosphere and the coating being cured can be
controlled by using a high speed at which the curing coating
traverses under the radiation source. Additionally, a water-cooled
drum positioned directly under the radiation source can also be
used to help in removing heat from the radiation chamber and the
substrate being cured. However, black bodies, soft substrates, and
temperature sensitive substrates still require proper care and an
external source for removing heat from the radiation chamber.

To properly control the temperature in the radiation chamber and
produce cured coatings with desirable properties, these materials
are generally processed in the presence of high flow rates of an
ambient temperature and high purity (containing 99.999% by volume
inert gas) inert gas, such as nitrogen, argon or helium. The high
flow rate of high purity inert gas helps in removing heat and
preventing buildup of heat in the radiation chamber.

Besides controlling the temperature of the coating, high purity
inert gas prevents buildup of oxygen in the radiation curing
chamber, which is known to abstract hydrogen from the coating
material and inhibit the curing process, as well as form ozone gas.
The use of high purity nitrogen gas for inerting radiation curing
chambers and purging oxygen barriers has been known for years. The
nitrogen gas used in radiation curing is generally supplied by
vaporizing more expensive cryogenically produced high purity liquid
nitrogen.

Ceramic Composite
Separates Oxygen

The Gas Research Institute (3424 S. State St., Chicago, IL  60616)
has developed composite ceramic ion and electronic conduction
materials with high ambipolar activity which can be fabricated into
thin membranes for high efficiency oxygen separation from air at
intermediate temperatures (U.S. Patent 5,478,444).

The mixed conducting materials have composite non-homogeneous
microstructures of a separate predominantly oxygen ion conductive
phase and a predominantly electronic conductive phase.
Predominantly oxygen ion conducting phases include bismuth, cerium
and thorium oxide based materials and predominantly electronic
conducting phases include at least one metal, metal oxide of at
least one metal, and at least one perovskite-type electronic
conductor material.

Prior materials used in oxygen separation have been electrolyte
materials, such as yttrium stabilized zirconia or ceria with CaF2
fluorite structure, which are predominantly oxygen ion conductors.
In electrolytes of such predominantly ionic conducting materials,
oxygen transport takes place on the ionic conducting electrolyte
while electrons move through an external electron circuit to
maintain electrical neutrality.

In addition to electrolyte materials such a prior device required
two electrodes as well as an external connection between the
electrodes, for example, porous platinum electrode layers and
platinum wire leads, both operating at high temperatures. An oxygen
semipermeation separation device according to the present invention
based on a mixed ionic-electronic conduction composite electrolyte
membrane eliminates the two porous electrodes and external electron
circuit.

Solid oxygen ion conducting electrolytes based on zirconium oxide
or cerium oxide have been used, but require relatively high
operating temperatures of about 1,000C since oxygen ionic
conductivity of these materials becomes significant only at high
temperatures, such as about 0.1 S/cm total electrical conductivity
at 1,000C for yttria stabilized zirconia.

Bismuth oxide has an electrical conductivity of higher than 0.33
S/cm at 750C which is much higher than zirconium oxide or cerium
oxide at that temperature. Use of ionic-electronic mixed conducting
materials based on bismuth oxide as an electrolyte, according to
this invention, permits the operating temperature of an oxygen
separation device to be at markedly lower temperatures than prior
zirconium oxide or cerium oxide based materials.

Montmorillonite
Shows Promise

It has been known for a long time that a membrane made of a pure
clay rejects ionic solutes.  The application of such a membrane in
separation technology, however, has never been attempted.
Researchers from The National Research Institute of Agricultural
Engineering (2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305 Japan), and the
University of Ottawa (Industrial Membrane Research Institute, Dept.
of Chemical Engineering, and Dept. of Chemistry, Ottawa K1N 6N5)
explored that possibility by investigating the solute separation
characteristics of a montmorillonite membrane.  Their findings have
been published in Journal of Membrane Science [107, 87-92, 1995].

As membrane separation technology broadens its scope, resistance
against heat, chemicals and corrosion becomes an increasingly
desired feature of the membrane material.  Unfortunately, polymeric
materials form which most commercial membranes are produced do not
necessarily meet these requirements.  For this reason, many studies
have been conducted on the development of inorganic membranes.

Various methods have been applied to prepare membranes from
inorganic material.  Alumina membranes were prepared by the sol-gel
method for ultrafiltration and microfiltration, zeolite membranes
were prepared for the separation of gas and vapor mixtures, and
zeolite particles were incorporated into silicone rubber to form a
composite membrane for pervaporation.

A montmorillonite membrane with a thickness of 0.5 mm was prepared
by sandwiching purified clay paste between two millipore filters
and reverse osmosis experiments were conducted for various
inorganic and organic solutes under an operating pressure of 3 MPa.

The membrane exhibited characteristics typical for a charged
membrane by rejecting sodium chloride solute less effectively with
increasing solute concentration.  The rejection of small organic
solutes was very low.  It was also found that the separation of
amino acids greatly depends on the net charge carried by the amino
acid molecule.  This membrane, it was found, opens up a route to
the effective fractionation of electrolyte/non-electrolyte mixtures
and amino acid mixtures.

Depositing Mol Sieves
on Macroporous Support

Eduard Geus and a team of Technische Universiteit Delft
(Julianalaan 134, 2628 BL Delft, The Netherlands; Tel: 15/789111,
Fax: 15/786522) researchers have made what they believe is a
breakthrough in creating a membrane that has the advantages of
molecular sieves membranes without the disadvantages.  Their
technology applies molecular sieve crystals, in a monolayer, on a
macroporous support.  The crystals have been oriented to a
substantial extent, such that the pores of the sieve crystals form
a significant included angle with the support surface.  The
membrane forms a gastight matrix between the crystals.

Geus et al write, in U.S. Patent 5,429,743, that their goal is to
manufacture a membrane with the highest possible degree of coverage
of molecular sieve crystals on the support.  In this way,
researchers realize the maximum membrane surface.  They emphasize
the importance of the form of the crystals and the uniformity of
the particle size.  The use of crystalline microporous materials,
such as the molecular sieve crystals, makes it possible to adjust
the pore size distribution on a molecular level.

The scientists describe the best configuration for a molecular
sieve membrane as occurring when the crystals are the only
separation between two fluids.  Then molecules can pass directly
from the first (or retentate) phase to the second (or permeate)
phase only through the micropores of the molecular sieve crystals.

One method involves the scattering of molecular sieve crystals on
the support.  Low frequency vibrations are used to form a crystal
monolayer that achieves about 80% coverage.  Even higher coverage
can be realized by using a liquid flow over a porous substrate with
the same liquid. This action pushes up the molecular sieve crystals
up to form an almost continuous layer on the support.

In another process, molecular sieve crystals are treated with a
surfactant, facilitating the formation of a hydrophobic surface by
the crystals.  These molecular sieves float on water.  A
macroporous support can be formed underneath the monolayer of
molecular sieve crystals.

Add Two More to
U.S. Filter Roster

A U.S. Filter Corp. (73-710 Fred Waring Dr., Palm Desert, CA 92260;
Tel: 619/340-0098) representative told us that at this time,
contrary to rumors, the company has not purchased FilmTec.  In last
month's issue of MSTN, we reported that Dow was consolidating
FilmTec's membrane manufacturing in Minneapolis, along with all R&D
activities.  Shortly after Dow's announcement, rumors began to fly
that FilmTec would become the next company to be swallowed by U.S.
Filter.

The company has, however, found something to munch on.  U.S. Filter
signed a definitive agreement to acquire Jet Tech, Inc. (1051 Blake
St., Kansas City, KS 66111; Tel: 915/422-7812, Fax: 915/422-7650)
for approximately $12 million in cash and stock, and has also
announced the acquisition of Continental Water Systems Northwest
(1521 15th St. NW, No. 2, Auburn, WA 98001; Tel: 206/850-0100).

Jet Tech expects revenues of about $16 million for the 1995
calendar year.  In addition to having installed over 400 systems in
the US, Jet Tech has a significant international base of customers,
especially in Puerto Rico and Mexico.  And Jet Tech's 30,000 sq.
ft. Edwardsville facility will complement U.S. Filter's already
strong design/build capability in the wastewater business.

Jet Tech designs and manufactures SBRs (sequencing batch reactors)
and ATADs (autothermal thermophilic aerobic digesters) with high-
efficiency air diffusion and mixing to enhance the biological
destruction of organic wastes.  Treating sludges and other
biosolids this way enables them to be used for land applications or
landfilling without restrictions.

Terms for U.S. Filter's acquisition of Continental Northwest were
not disclosed.  The company had been a U.S. Filter franchised
dealer for several years.  Continental Northwest sells and services
high-purity water products from its facilities in Auburn and
Vancouver, WA, to more than 900 customers throughout Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, Montana and Alaska.  Continental also owns and
operates a resin regeneration facility in Vancouver, which serves,
among others, the rapidly growing electronics industry in the area
around Portland, OR.

Jorie Blvd., Oak Brook, IL 60521-2268; Tel: 708/572-7000) disclosed
that they have signed a definitive merger agreement in which
Praxair will purchase all outstanding common shares of CBI for
$33.00 per share in cash.  The Boards of Directors of both
companies have unanimously approved the agreement.  To complete the
transaction, Praxair stated it intends next  week to amend its
tender offer commenced on November 3, 1995 to  increase its
offering price to $33.00 per share.  Consummation of the tender
offer is subject to terms and conditions to be set forth in the
tender offer.

H. William Lichtenberger, Praxair's chairman and CEO, announced
that the strategic fit between the two companies will lead to
greater sales growth, lower costs and a wider array of products,
applications and technologies.  CBI's chairman and president, John
E. Jones, added that CBI shareholders will be well-served by this
merger agreement since Praxair's position as a world leader in
industrial gases will strengthen CBI's global operations and
present its employees with significant new opportunities.

Anxiety among CBI's work force spread after CBI's board accepted
the $33-per-share takeover offer from Praxair.  Although Praxair
officials have said nothing about employment at CBI, they have said
they wanted CBI solely for its Liquid Carbonic division, which
makes carbon dioxide for soft drinks.  It is expected that Praxair
will probably dispose of CBI's two other units, the Chicago Bridge
& Iron contracting division and the Statia Terminals oil storage
subsidiary.  Combined, the two groups account for slightly more
than half the company's 15,000 employees.

CBI's top five executives could walk away with $21.6 million in
golden parachutes.  The severance payments represent two-thirds of
the $34.6 million in profits the company reported for the first
nine months of this year.  Jones, who was paid nearly $1.1 million
in salary and bonuses last year, owns 71,776 shares of stock now
worth about $2.3 million. According to the company's annual proxy
statement, he will receive $9.6 million as a result of the merger.
Lewis E. Akin, executive VP in charge of Chicago Bridge & Iron, has
a  golden parachute worth $4.3 million and Liquid Carbonic chief
Calvin E. Willoughby will get $3.4 million.

Praxair is the largest industrial gases company in North and  South
America, and one of the largest non-cryogenic gas companies
worldwide. 1994 sales were $2.7 billion.  The company produces,
sells and distributes  atmospheric, process and specialty gases,
and high-performance  surface coatings.

Culligan Acquires
Bruner Corp.

Culligan Water Technologies, Inc. (One Culligan Pkwy., Northbrook,
IL 60062; Tel: 708/205-6000) has acquired the Bruner Corp. (500 W.
Oklahoma Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53207; Tel: 414/747-3700, Fax:
414/747-3780). Bruner is a water treatment equipment manufacturer
focusing primarily on commercial and industrial customers through
an extensive network of sales representatives in the U.S. and
internationally.  In 1995, its sales were approximately $15
million. The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately
$6.5 million.

Douglas A. Pertz, Culligan's president and CEO, believes the
acquisition of Bruner combines two of the oldest and most trusted
names in water treatment.  He stated that Bruner will significantly
expands Culligan's presence in the commercial and industrial water
treatment markets and opens new channels of distribution where
Culligan previously was not a significant participant.

Culligan is one of the world's leading manufacturers and
distributors of water purification and treatment products for
household, commercial and industrial applications.  Products and
services offered by the company range from those designed to solve
common residential water problems, such as filters for tap water

Understanding
Filtrate Flux

Toshiro Murase, Than Ohn and Katumi Kimata of Nagoya University
(Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Nagoya, Japan) studied the
crossflow MF characteristics of dilute suspension, which produce a
highly compressible fouling cake-layer and/or a highly viscous
filtrate, under constant pressure.  Their findings are reported in
Journal of Membrane Science [108, 121-128, 1995).

Crossflow operation is being used more and more to achieve
efficient performance of membrane separations.  The most serious
operational constraint in industrial use is the flux decline caused
by membrane fouling.  Over the last decade, much research has been
carried out to investigate the microfiltration (MF) mechanisms
underlying the crossflow membrane modules.

Several models which evaluate the transient and steady-state flux
during crossflow MF have been studied based on the assumption of
the incompressibility of the fouling layer and the rigidity of
suspensoids.  Also, for fully understanding the effects of process
parameters on the flux decline, an experimental study of membrane
fouling and permeate flux has been presented recently.

The characteristics of dynamic MF with a rotating cylinder or disk-
shaped medium has been examined for remarkably reducing membrane
fouling suing low compressibility suspended solids as experimental
materials.  In areas such as biotechnology, food engineering, and
sewage treatment, however, it is known that the hydraulic
resistance of the fouling layer to permeation shows a heavy
dependence on the operating pressure, and the compressibility of
the deposits become an important factor for evaluating the flux
decline during crossflow operation.

The Nagoya research found that even when the ceramic membrane used
has a much smaller pore size than the particle size of the
suspended solids, the crossflow MF process of dilute suspension
generally consists of two stages--media filtration at an earlier
stage and thin-cake filtration at a later stage.  With the PMMA
material having an average particle size of 7.0 micron, the medium
filtration period expands with decreasing solids concentration.

When the filtration variables, such as the solids concentration and
the filtration pressure, pass a critical level the medium
filtration period ceases, and thin-cake filtration covers the whole
process after the operation starts.  Its equilibrium flux can be
related to a number of operating variables in terms of a few
parameters including both the shear stress acting on the cake
surface and the Ruth's filtration coefficient.  Referring to this
empirical correlation, it becomes evident that, due to the effects
of the crossflow stream on the internal structure of fouling-layer,
the high cake-compressibility yields a remarkable decrease in the
steady flux.

Treatment Softens
Regulatory Burden

Increasingly, nanofiltration is being used to soften water in
Florida, particularly for applications where the feed water has
high color and dissolved organics (which are precursors to
regulated disinfectant byproducts).  Robert Bergman of CH2M Hill
(7201 N.W. 11th Pl., Gainesville, FL 32605; Tel: 904/331-2442, Fax:
904/331-5320) has undertaken a cost comparison study between
membrane and lime softening, and the results reported in
Desalination [102, 1995, 11-24, 1995].

In Florida, about 87% of public water supplies are derived from
groundwater.  Commonly, these water supplies are classified as
being "hard," that is, having relatively high concentrations of
calcium.  Many of these supplies also have substantial dissolved
organic color, hydrogen sulfide, and iron.

Until about 10 years ago, essentially all municipal groundwater
treatment plants in Florida practicing softening used the lime
process and, in many cases, relatively high dosages of chlorine for
disinfection and "bleaching-out color."  With the onset of more
stringent drinking water standards, particularly for disinfectants
and disinfectant byproducts, and the development and
commercialization of nanofiltration membranes, new softening plants
in the state have favored membrane softening over lime in treating
colored groundwater.

In fact, Florida water utilities are the world leaders in
nanofiltration application in terms of installed capacity.
Nanofiltration is a physical barrier treatment process that
separates harness ions, dissolved organics, and total dissolved
solids from water.

Bergman's inquiry showed that lime softening plant costs were lower
than membrane softening throughout the entire range, but the
relative difference in costs decreased with larger facilities.  For
15 mgd plants, the lower range of the membrane softening plant
costs is only about 10% greater than for lime softening plant
costs.  For any specific application, both softening technologies
should be considered, at least for initial feasibility analysis.
Furthermore, if additional treatment processes (such as ozone) are
added to lime softening to produce water quality comparable to
membrane softening permeate (with lower color and THMFP), membrane
softening can have lower construction costs than lime softening.

Lime softening (alone) is generally less expensive than membrane
softening, assuming no bypass/blending and a 100% plant operating
factor.  As plant capacities increase, the relative costs between
the two processes decrease.  Generally, membrane softening O&M
costs are about 15% greater than lime softening O&M costs.

Again, if additional treatment processes are added to lime
softening to match the better membrane softening permeate water
quality, or if some water can be bypassed around the membranes and
blended to produce the finished water (thus taking advantage of the
superior water quality from the membrane process), membrane
softening can be less expensive than lime softening.

Bergman found that the slightly higher costs for membrane softening
over lime softening are more than justified for many utilities that
desire the superior product water quality.

Osmonics Removes
Hazardous Radiation

The use of nanofiltration has solved a nuclear wastewater disposal
problem for a hazardous waste remediation company.  The company was
contracted to process nearly 400,000 gal. of water contaminated
with radioactive material.  The liquid waste contained
approximately 10% dissolved salts and other chemicals in addition
to the radioactive contaminants.

Traditional ion exchange and adsorption techniques had not been
effective at removing the radioactive material and reverse osmosis
membrane processing was not a viable option due to the excessive
osmotic pressure caused by the high salt concentration.

Osmonics (5951 Clearwater Dr., Minnetonka, MN 55343; Tel: 612/933-
2277, Fax: 612/933-0141) manufactured a crossflow membrane system
with nanofiltration membrane elements which passed a high
percentage of the salts while retaining most of the radioactive
material.  By passing a majority of the salts, the osmotic pressure
effect was negated, allowing  a successful application.

Modular Nozzle
for Hollow Fibers

Brown University Research Foundation (Providence, RI ) scientists
Frank Gentile, Michael Lysaght, and Nicholas Warner have invented
a new piece of apparatus for making hollow fibers (U.S. Patent
5,480,598).

No matter what the particular application of the hollow fiber
vehicles, the morphology and thickness of the fiber membrane must
be controlled to obtain the desired mechanical and transport
properties suitable for the particular application.  The
conventional synthetic-fiber spinning methods that can be used to
produce hollow-fiber membranes: 1) melt spinning; 2) dry spinning;
3) wet spinning; and 4) a combination of dry and wet spinning.  In
each of these methods, a tubular cross-section of the hollow fiber
is formed by delivering a spinning material such as a polymer,
copolymer, cellulosic material, or the like, through a spinneret
nozzle while simultaneously delivering a material to be housed in
the core of the fiber.

Some of the problems associated with these prior art nozzle
assemblies and hollow fiber forming techniques include an inability
to form fibers from highly viscous thermoplastic polymers due to
nozzle clogging, an inability to adjust the nozzle assembly to
produce varying membrane thicknesses and morphologies, an inability
to change nozzle types or nozzle caps in the assembly so as to
allow for the production of different types and shapes of hollow
fibers, and an inability to produce Z-fibers having trabeculae
oriented substantially longitudinally within the fiber wall and
substantially interconnected with one another within the fiber
wall.

The Brown University invention describes a nozzle assembly for
forming hollow fibers, particularly a "Z-fiber" with longitudinally
oriented trabeculae with the fiber wall. The nozzle assembly
contains a replaceable nozzle cap, a replaceable seal-guide, and a
retractable central bore used to supply core material for the
hollow fibers. The Z-fibers are particularly useful in enabling
cells, solutes, or the like, to enter the fiber wall and move
longitudinally into the center of the fiber wall.

Blotting Stain
Is Reversible

A new reversible protein blotting stain from Sigma Chemical Co.
(P.O. Box 14508, St. Louis, MO 63178; Tel: 800/325-3010) provides
sensitivity and low background for blotting nylon, nitrocellulose,
and PVDF membranes as well as PAGE gels. Blotting is a useful tool
for quickly screening complex mixtures of proteins and peptides.
The probes for detecting the molecule of interest are labeled;
ether radiolabeled, biotinylated, or enzyme-linked.

Western blotting involves transferring proteins onto a
semipermeable membrane, either directly from solution or after
electrophoresis on polyacrylamide.  The membrane is probed with a
protein-specific primary antibody, then an enzyme-conjugated
secondary antibody.  A chromogenic substrate for the conjugated
enzyme develops color only where the specific protein is found on
the membrane.

In order to determine protein purity, a second visualization
method-a general protein stain-is needed, and that requires
duplicate gels.  However, correlation of bands on duplicate gels is
often difficult.  It would be useful to be able to stain the
overall protein pattern and then immunostain the same blot.  For
such an application, the general protein stain must be sensitive
and reversible and have low background binding to many membrane
types.

If the immunostain recognizes only the native protein, the general
stain should leave the protein undernatured.  It is best that the
stain not contain highly toxic components, so handling and disposal
would be simpler and safer.

Sigma's new protein stain, a metal chelate called RPRO-B, meets
these criteria.  This stain is suitable for nitrocellulose, nylon,
and PVDF membranes as well as PAGE gels.  Destaining is a mild
procedure requiring only an EDTA solution, and the sensitivity and
specificity of immunostaining afterward are usually unaffected.

Membranes are stained with the Sigma product by soaking at room
temperature for about 3 minutes.  Polyacrylamide gels should be
fixed first, stained with RPRO-B for 40 minutes, then destained in
the fixing solution.  Brilliant Blue R remains the stain of choice
for permanent staining of proteins on PVDF membranes and
polyacrylamide gels.  But for reversible staining, and for staining
all common membrane types as well as PAGE gels, Sigma's RPRO-B
deserves a closer look.

Whither Seawater
Desalination?

Great things have been predicted for seawater desalination in the
U.S., but have more or less failed to materialize.  Gordon Leitner
of Leitner and Associates, Inc. (815 Shadow Lawn Dr., Elm Grove, WI
53122; Tel: 414/782-5236) has explored the question of what
actually happened to this technology in Desalination [102, 199-
207,1995].

Installed seawater desalting capacity in the 50 states of the U.S.
is currently 13 mgd.  Only 3 mgd is produced on a regular basis,
with the rest of the installed capacity on standby.  This is a
minuscule percentage of ambitious projections that were made 25
years ago.  It is also well below the projections being made just
3 years ago.

The 1992 IDA Worldwide Desalting Plants inventory lists eight
seawater desalting plants proposed projects within the continental
limits of the U.S. with a total capacity of 67 mgd.  Not one of
these proposed plants is currently under active consideration as of
this writing.  Another plant not included on the list was under
active consideration until early 1994, after which the project was
shelved.

To begin with, Leitner says that the forecasts of 30 years ago, as
well as more recent forecasts, have been fraught with outside
influences that had a dynamic effect on the market place.  While
the changes in this small industry covered a longer span than the
growth of the computer, they confirm a common truism-even the
wisest sage could not have predicted the changes that have
occurred.

Water conservation and reuse were not given much consideration 35
years ago.  The mindset of the U.S. in the 1960s was not thinking
of conservation.  The mindset changed.  During the most recent 5-
year California drought, conservation and water management efforts
are credited with reducing water delivery by 15% or more.  The
treatment and recycling of municipal wastewater has increased
significantly over the past decade in California and in some
coastal states and will continue to do so.  There are more than 200
reclamation facilities in California alone, treating over 400,000
acre feet of municipal wastewater a year-about 5% of urban
deliveries.

Leitner believes the U.S. will have municipal seawater desalination
plants only when the need is accurately demonstrated.  When this
occurs, there is substantial evidence that an 80-100 mgd seawater
RO plant can be build in the U.S., and when operated in conjunction
with a combined cycle electric power plant, will deliver water at
the plant site at a cost in the range of $2.00 per 1000 gallons
(1994 dollars).

In the author's opinion, there is less evidence that the large
vertical tube multi-effect distillation plant being studied by the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California can do the same,
but the work carried out to date suggests the efforts be continued.

Leitner suggests that the industry needs to be alert to
opportunities, in particular when privatization might lead the way
to lower costs.  In addition, industry must continue to search for
innovative ways to lower costs, including the effect of blending
with other sources.  Municipalities interested in seawater
desalination should be guided to an awareness that a water
transport pipeline is always too large when first installed and
most always too small in later years.

With modular seawater desalination units, added construction can be
carefully tuned to demand increases.  Industry needs to emphasize
that rates for conventional supplies will double this decade.
Seawater desalination costs should hold steady with improved
technology.

Performance Is
in the Design

According to Weir Westgarth, a leader in desalination technology,
speaking at the IDA World Congress on desalination and water
services in Abu Dhabi in November, RO seawater desalination plants
can perform successfully and reliably if designed conservatively
and operated properly.

RO plants have been criticized for not meeting some customers'
expectations, particularly in the Persian Gulf region.  RO has been
promoted as having a lower capital cost than an equivalent capacity
thermal plant.  Westgarth, presenting a paper co-authored by Alan
Linstrum, Peter Nicoll, George Mulholland, and Tom Leith, said that
while first cost is important, other considerations have to be
taken into account when assessing through life cost-particularly
reliability, design, operating costs, and the experience of the
consultant and desalination contractor.

Environmental conditions are seldom considered in the case of RO,
and this was cited as probably the most important aspect of
selection.  Ideally, small prototype pilot units should be built on
all sites intended for large RO installations at least 1.5 years
before the full size plant design is required.  This would be used
to test and optimize conventional pretreatment options to handle
the large swings in water quality that can occur in shallow, warm
coastal sea water. The performance of different membrane types
under varying environmental conditions should be studied.

A comparison carried out of MSF and RO technology concluded that
for large multi-million gallon installations in the Gulf, thermal
plants provide the best technology for combined power and water
schemes.  While RO has the lowest capital and operating costs,
these types of plants in the Gulf are subject to some of the most
arduous feedwater conditions in the world-the MSF process is not so
susceptible to these conditions.

More realistic replacement rates of membranes, based on actual
operational experience, should be considered when evaluating
product water costs at the early stages of the project. Real
replacement rates are a major factor influencing life cost
assessment.

Westgarth concluded that both MSF and RO have a role to play in
meeting the future needs of customers for desalinated water.
Looking at the pros and cons of both systems, the authors found
that RO has a shorter construction period, initially lower capital
costs, and more flexible operation.  MSF water was of a higher
quality, was unaffected by suspended or biological matter, and the
system became more efficient and productive in colder winter
months.

Materials Influence
Adsorptive Fouling

The hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of membrane materials have
an important influence on the membrane flux reduction when treating
solutions containing hydrophobic solutes.  Different methods of
measuring the hydrophobic properties of membranes have been
evaluated, with measurement of the contact angle being the most
commonly used method.

Journal of Membrane Science [108, 79-87,1995] reports on a study in
which the flux reduction of eight membranes of approximately the
same cut-off, but of different materials, was determined and
related to the contact angle by Catharine Jnsson and Ann-Sofi
Jnsson of Lund University (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, P.O. Box
124, S-221 00 Lund, Sweden).

Low-molecular weight hydrophobic solutes, such as fatty acids,
alcohols and alkanes, are found in many natural solutions treated
by ultrafiltration (UF).  Although the concentrations of these
substances are usually low, they can reduce the membrane flux
severely. The flux of polysulfone membranes with a nominal
molecular weight cut-off more than 100 times greater than the
molecular weight of the solute was significantly reduced when
treating an octanoic acid solution, and surfactants, many times
smaller than the membrane pores, were found to reduce the flux of
microfiltration membranes.

The Jnssons found that the flux of the hydrophilic membrane was
only marginally reduced, whereas the flux reduction of hydrophobic
membranes was significant.  Membranes of polyvinylidene fluoride
had the lowest flux reduction of the hydrophobic membranes.
Differences between membranes of the same material
(polyethersulfone), but from different manufacturers, were
observed.  No relation was found between the flux reduction and the
contact angle of the membrane, the initial pure water flux or the
retention of a hydrophilic macromolecule (PEG20).

The pure water flux of two of the hydrophobic membranes increased
significantly during the experiments, whereas the pure water flux
of the other hydrophobic membranes decreased.  A membrane of
polyaramide, with a contact angle of the same order of magnitude as
the other hydrophobic membranes, behaved as a hydrophilic membrane,
with no influence on the flux at concentrations below the
solubility limit of the hydrophobic solute, but experienced the
most severe flux decline of all the membranes included in the
investigation at the solubility limit.

Two modified membranes were included in the investigation.  The
flux reduction of the these membranes was not significantly lower
than for the corresponding unmodified membranes of the same
materials.

Pall Researches the
Wet-Dry Reversible

Pall Corp. (2200 Northern Blvd., East Hills, NY 11548; Tel:
516/484-5400, Fax: 516/484-5228) has developed integrity-testable,
wet-dry-reversible ultrafiltration membranes.  For the first time,
ultrafiltration/diafiltration membranes are capable of excluding
0.02 micron diameter, monodisperse, latex particles.  The membranes
can be dried without loss of ultrafiltration properties. A rapid,
reliable method for integrity testing membranes also has been
developed. The test has particular applicability to ultrafiltration
membranes, although it may also be used for testing microfiltration
membranes (U.S. Patent 5,480,554).

Two general structural varieties of asymmetric, integrally-skinned,
phase inversion UF membranes are known. The original and still most
commonly encountered variety of UF membrane consists essentially of
a bilayer having a thin skin exhibiting what has been termed slit-
like fissures or cracks, and a thick substructure containing a high
concentration of finger-like intrusions or macrovoids. The
macrovoids often extend from one surface to the other although they
are sometimes buried more deeply within the matrix. Ideally, an
integral skin covers the macrovoids, but in practice, some of the
skin above the macrovoids may be cracked. Cracks break the
integrity of the skin and enable the passage of large particles.
These membranes are supplied wetted with a pore supporting fluid
since they cannot tolerate full dryness without severe loss of
filtration performance.

Bacteriostats, which must be washed out of the membrane before
usage, are often present in membranes that are supplied wet. Some
manufacturers indicate in their catalogs that a membrane is being
supplied "dry," however, these membranes may contain humectants
such as glycerol as a pore supporting fluid. As with bacteriostats,
humectants must be removed from the membrane by soaking, flushing
or by some other method that never permits the membrane to become
fully dried.

The second general type of UF membrane purportedly produces
integrally-skinned membranes with macrovoid-free matrices by
increasing the viscosity of the casting solution through the
addition of water soluble viscosity enhancing polymeric additives
such as PVP or PEG. These membranes exhibit a skin with a pore size
distribution which is too broad to be integrity-tested because of
the leaching of the polymeric additives during precipitation and
washing steps.

These membranes can be supplied "dry" (i.e., no free liquid
present), but contain high concentrations of residual PVP or PEG.
Humectants such as glycerol, PVP, PEG and/or water and other
wetting fluids may act as plasticizers to diminish friability.
These materials may also act as pore supporting fluids which if
removed lead to cracks and other defects in the membrane skin.

Because of the wide and large number of applications for
ultrafiltration membranes, considerable effort has been spent to
improve the effectiveness of such membranes, but to date, with
limited success. Many patents and articles have been published
regarding the manufacture of ultrafiltration membranes, some
claiming them to be "defect-free," and some claiming them to be
dryable, but the fact remains that no ultrafiltration membrane has
heretofore been produced that is both dryable and which is free of
defects.

In  the Pall testing method, referred to as the KUF method, the
test membrane is thoroughly wetted with a wetting liquid. A
displacing liquid is placed in contact with one side of the wetted
membrane and increasing pressure is applied to the displacing
liquid. The flow rate through the membrane is measured as a
function of the applied pressure.

The displacing liquid is substantially insoluble in the wetting
liquid and the interfacial tension between the two liquids is about
10.0 dynes/cm or less. A plot of the flow rate of liquid, per unit
area of the membrane, through the membrane as a function of applied
pressure can be made and a straight line may be drawn through the
steep part of the resulting curve, using regression analysis, which
will intersect the horizontal axis at a given pressure value, which
is then the KUF value.

Irradiation Forms
Better Bioreactor

Scientists at NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX
77058; Tel: 713/483-3809, Fax: 713/244-8452) have built an improved
bioreactor for growing mammalian cell cultures.  Such bioreactors
can be used to support the growth of dense volumes of mammalian
cells by providing ample, well distributed flows of nutrient
solution with minimal turbulence.  Such gentle nonturbulent flow
environments in the growth media are necessary because mammalian
cells are relatively delicate and cannot withstand the shear forces
present in turbulent flows.

The new bioreactor, reports Glenn F. Spaulding, may be made from
polymers such as polystyrene or polypropylene by inexpensive
injection molding or vacuum forming techniques.  Conventional units
are machined and assembled using more expensive materials such as
zirconium, stainless steel, acetal, and polycarbonate.  The
cylinder walls in the new bioreactor are typically one millimeter
(mm) thick.  The pores are formed by rotating the vessel about its
cylindrical axis by exposing it to a beam of neutrons, protons,
electrons, or other particles.  The impinging particles drill
straight holes through both the inner and outer cylinder walls,
forming pores with diameters of 5-20 microns located about 50
microns apart.

In a typical growth procedure, mammalian cells and beads, which
serve as a substrate on which the cells grow, are placed in the
vessel.  Fresh culture medium is also injected and air bubbles are
removed to eliminate head space in the vessel.  The vessel is then
rotated until the beads and cells are uniformly distributed.
Periodically during the growth process, half the medium is removed
and replaced, and the proportion of glucose in the fresh solution
is gradually increased to meet the demands of the growing culture.
The culture is removed when the cellular aggregates have grown
large enough to be useful for research--usually 100-1,000 microns.

Like other bioreactors developed for this purpose, the NASA product
is cylindrical.  In operation, it is rotated slowly about its
cylindrical axis in a horizontal position.  The new bioreactor
differs from its predecessors in the manner in which it supplies
oxygen to and removes waste gases from the cells and nutrient
medium.  In older units, this job is accomplished with the help of
pumps and the ancillary plumbing and rotating couplings, which
supply pressurized air to cylindrical core perfusion membranes.
The new bioreactor functions without any connected plumbing and can
be rotated on any standard laboratory bottle roller.

The NASA bioreactor consists of integrally molded concentric
cylinders with a connecting wall at one end and a tightly fitting
cap at the other.  Syringe ports in the cap are used to introduce
nutrient medium and cells into the vessel and to remove excess air
bubbles and spent medium.  Small pores are in the inner and outer
cylinder walls and form membranes which permit oxygen to diffuse
into the vessel and waste gases to diffuse out.  The pores are
small enough, though, to prevent the nutrient medium and cells from
leaking out.  The effective surface area of the membranes in the
new units is 2-10 times as large as in the older units.

Toray Creates
Antithrombotic

Researchers at Toray Industries (2-1, Nihonbashi-Muromachi 2-chome,
Chuo-ku, Tokyo 130 Japan) have synthesized a hydrophilic material
and a formed a semipermeable membrane from that material (U.S.
Patent 5,480,953).

When membranes are used for medical care and brought into contact
with blood or body fluid, their components such as platelets,
leucocytes, erythrocytes and fibroblasts inevitably adhere, and
there are fears that these adhered components generate a thrombus
on a surface of a membrane coming into contact with blood and that
the components affect a complement. As a result, formation of a
thrombus or reduction of an immunity function is presumed to be
caused.

Various attempts to solve these difficulties have been made. In
synthesizing a hydrophilic copolymer containing a polyalkylene
oxide chain, copolymerized with an acrylic or methacrylic ester,
the content of polyalkylene oxide in the copolymer can be too high,
and there is a problem that the synthesized copolymer becomes a gel
in spite of the kind of the acrylic or methacrylic ester used. The
gel can hardly be dissolved in a solvent. In such a case, it cannot
be used as a coating material and cannot be formed as a fiber or a
membrane.

Even if the content of polyalkylene oxide is low, a satisfactory
anti-fouling property and antithrombotic property have not been
demonstrated. Research to improve the gel structure, a polymer,
which can be easily dissolved in a solvent, which has a high water
content and which has a high affinity with acrylic ester or
methacrylic ester, was synthesized by copolymerizing an acrylic
ester or methacrylic ester, polyalkylene oxide and another
copolymerizable component.

The material developed is characterized as a copolymer composed of
a monomer with a polyalkylene oxide unit and a polymerizable
carbon-carbon double bond in its molecule, a methacrylic ester
monomer or an acrylic ester monomer and a monomer with a
polymerizable carbon-carbon double bond other than the first two
monomers, and the content of the monomer is not less than 5% by
weight and not more than 90% by weight.

The hydrophilic material can be dissolved in a solvent and has
excellent antithrombotic and anti-fouling properties, and provides
an antithrombotic semipermeable membrane. These materials can be
appropriately used in the medical field and as water-absorbent and
anti-fouling materials.

BOOKS

Principles and
Applications

The field of membrane separation technology is in a state of rapid
growth and innovation.  Many different membrane separation
processes have been developed during the past half century and new
processes are constantly emerging from academic, industrial, and
governmental laboratories.  Membrane Separations Technology:
Principles and Applications, edited by R.D. Noble and S.A. Stern
(Elsevier Science B.V., publisher), presents the basics on a
variety of membrane separation processes from the unique
perspectives of investigators who have made important contributions
to their fields.

Significant improvements are being made in many aspects of membrane
separation technology-in the development of new materials with high
selectivity and permeability, in fabrication methods for high-flux
asymmetric or composite membranes, in membrane module construction,
and in process design.

Contributing authors include William Eykamp (microfiltration and
ultrafiltration), M.H.V. Mulder (polarization phenomena and
membrane fouling), Ed Cussler (membrane contractors), and Robert
Spillman (economics of gas separation membrane processes).  The
book is of interest to anyone who wishes to learn about a general
area of applications or be the more knowledgeable person seeking
some detailed information.  The hardbound book is $340.00.

INSTITUTE FOR THE AMERICAN URBAN LANDSCAPE RE-MAPS ST. PAUL

By:
Aaron Betsky

(St. Paul)
``Our infrastructure is our new social covenant,'' says urban designer Bill
Morrish. After years of mapping his home territory of Minneapolis-St. Paul,
he is proving his point with an ambitious plan for the revitalization of
St. Paul. The Institute for the American Urban Landscape, directed by
Morrish and his wife, Catherine Brown, at the School of Architecture of the
University of Minnesota, has created a blueprint for the city that will use
its natural location to attract new businesses, industry, culture, and
inhabitants. Now, with the help of Toronto-based planner Ken Greenberg, the
city is implementing many of the Institute's plans. ``Every city needs a
sense of a whole, how things connect to create a community,'' says Mayor
Ken Coleman, ``and Catherine and Bill have provided that.''

Morrish and Brown start their investigations with the land itself.
Specifically, the focus on watersheds, not only because they believe
development patterns follow the rivers, knotting together around crossings,
portages, or ports, but also because the flow of water maps aspects of the
geography that otherwise might not be noticed. In the Minne-
apolis-St. Paul area, the city established itself at the last navigable
point of the Mississippi. Neighborhoods developed first on bluffs, and then
by tracing the alluvial fans of creeks draining into the river. The flood
plains were taken over by industry, and cuts in the bluffs became corridors
for trains and, later, cars and trucks.

The first task of any urban design, Brown and Morrish point out, is to
rediscover and re-use these patterns on an urban scale. Thus as the
``industrial glacier'' that traced the flood plains created by the real
glaciers recedes, they want to turn the resulting flat plains into
combinations of ``clean'' industrial parks and green zones, allowing the
natural hydrology of the area to shape the development. The natural routes
along the bluffs, which birds trace in their flight pattern overhead, were
already converted into a system of parkways according to a 1917 plan by
William Bennett, and Brown and Morrish want to finish its missing links.

The problem for downtown St. Paul is its immediate relation to the river.
As in many other cities, highway development in the 1960s cut off the city
from its shore. Thus, cars replaced boats along the river corridor, and
tiered parking garages badly mimicked the bluffs. To Greenberg, this
situation becomes an excuse for an ``urban terrace'' such as the ones in
Quebec City or Brooklyn Heights. In the future, landscaped stairs and
escalators will connect a series of new cultural institutions, such as a
Science Museum currently under construction, to a river front where a
$500-million flood-control project has created new walkways and park areas.
He then envisions retractable canopies over these public spaces to replace
the ubiquitous and isolating skywalk system. A renovation of Wabasha
Avenue, currently underway, will link the State Capitol through downtown to
a thriving Hispanic community on the opposite bank of the river. ``What we
do is to connect buildings. Instead of the cult of the isolated project, we
link neighborhoods,'' Greenberg explains.

Though some of these projects resemble traditional urban-planning
solutions, Brown and Morrish point out that they are part of a larger
reading of the region. They think it is not just a question of revitalizing
downtown or creating parks, but of figuring out what to do with the ``mushy
context'' of the concentric rings of suburbs the city is producing out in
the prairie. In the Institute's newsletter and the group's consulting work,
they have proposed ways that all of these communities could be linked both
to one another and to the natural terrain to foster a sense of reality.
``The first thing you need,'' says Morrish, ``is a common language. It's
not as much about land use as it is about reading the land.'' By focusing
on ``topography, not typology,'' they hope to ``inflect social and
geographic systems to make them work better together.''

In St. Paul, this means creating maps of the city that have made it legible
to the various neighborhoods and pressure groups that shape the political
landscape. ``The main thing they have achieved,'' says Patrick Seeb,
executive director of the non-profit St. Paul Riverfront Corporation, ``is
to let people see the vitality of St. Paul. Their maps act as catalysts
that bring people `around the table' who weren't there.'' The result is a
plan of connections rather than isolated development schemes.

``They lay out the environment,'' says Mayor Coleman, ``and then we can
market that.'' St. Paul, he hopes, will emerge out of Minneapolis' shadow
to become a ``big small town'' embedded in a network of small towns
connected by the river and its watershed. Out of that fertile plain will
come rational development and a better place to live. As the Mayor puts it:
``Cities are places people have in common.''

BLOODY SUNSET: HOUSING TAX CREDITS HEAD FOR OBLIVION, UNLESS--

By:
Stephen A. Kliment

One of the more bizarre dramas to hit the political scene in years is
playing itself out at this writing in Washington, D.C. Chairman Bill Archer
of the House Ways and Means Committee, miffed at a proposal by Democrats in
the last Congress to give permanent status to the Low Income Housing Tax
Credit (LIHTC) program--it's a part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act--but to deny
it to a parallel R&D program, persuaded both the House and a joint
Senate-House conference committee to sunset the program after 1997.
Sunsetting is a term that has emerged in recent years to ensure that
programs no longer deemed viable are ended. Currently the LIHTC program is
subject to year-to-year funding, an inefficient process that defies
long-term planning.

In this case, there's a tragedy in the making. LIHTC is the only existing
housing support program to have made a dent in the dire shortage of housing
for low-income families. Producing over 100,000 units a year, it is the
largest driver of new and renovated low- and moderate-income housing in the
nation, pouring some $320 million a year into state-administered programs.
It provides 20 per cent of all multi-family housing, revitalizes
communities by involving them in the planning process, creates
opportunities for architects, provides construction jobs, and generates new
businesses in the community. And it's virtually the only game in town. (See
this month's Building Types Study on affordable housing, beginning on page
86).

It works like this. To build housing at below-market cost, developers need
to borrow capital at an affordable rate. Investors provide the capital,
receive tax credits under the program for 10 years on any profits they
make, and write-offs for passive real estate losses for another five,
promising them a tidy return over the 15 years, after which they can sell
the housing. The reduced costs are passed on to the tenant families in the
form of lower rents.

The idea of a housing safety net provided by government has gone though a
range of scenarios since it was launched in the 1930s, tacking past the
tricky political shoals pitting social sensitivity against rugged
self-reliance, homeownership against rent support, project-based support
against tenant-based support. The scenario for the 1990s is the tax-credit
that motivates investors to help provide housing at affordable rents.

Architects have both a business interest and a social interest in
preserving the pro-gram. Without getting into the recondite byways of
federal legislation, the bottom line is that the program, to receive funds,
needs to get into an approved ``reconciliation bill,'' an instrument that
matches expenditures and tax provisions against budgets. That's the
challenge now on the table. Both political parties by and large agree that
it's the most efficient, productive program at work. Everyone gains--the
community, the family, the investor, and the construction industry.

As AIA's director of federal legislative affairs, Al Eisenberg, told
RECORD, ``There's no reason for this program to be in jeopardy.'' Let's
keep it alive.

THE MARKET'S BUYING GREEN
Environmental Home Programs showcasing energy-efficiency and
ecological-design strategies are sprouting all over the country.
Their success certifies green design's market appeal.

By:
By Elena Marcheso Moreno

Building green is becoming big business, particularly for the housing
industry where individual homeowners have the opportunity to make choices.
Given the vast size of the residential-building market, the potential is
staggering. In one year the energy demands of a single home release tons of
CO2 into the atmosphere, according to Elena Cotton Westbrook, an
environmental consultant in Garland, Tex. ``When you consider the capital
resources, transportation, delivery, and related systems required to
produce this much energy, you can see that reducing home-energy needs will
create significant environmental benefits across the spectrum,'' says
Westbrook, who, along with her mechanical-engineer husband, Paul Westbrook,
is building an eco-house.

Energy is just one element of ecologically sensitive design, but builders
and architects across the nation are jumping onto the bandwagon. For the
most part, these houses offer real improvement over conventionally designed
and built houses. Besides using less energy, they incorporate recycled or
re-used materials, and if not bow, at least nod to the native landscape.
It's important that significant segments of the housing industry are
promoting the premise that a sustainable society is not only possible, but
necessary. And most Americans are willing to wear the green hat of an
environmentalist if they feel they can afford it.

But it's not all about making the earth a better place. The
indoor-air-quality problems of existing construction practice are also
driving the eco-home movement. As synthetic furnishings, fabrics,
chemicals, finishes, and materials have become more prevalent, toxic
outgassing of common building materials has taken on a higher profile,
exacerbated by energy-conserving tight construction when provision of fresh
air isn't handled properly.

Models of sustainability
Sponsored by the government agencies, local non-profit groups,
manufacturers, and utilities, a number of sustainable-housing demonstration
projects are appearing around the country.

Every Canadian province has participated in the Advanced House program
being conducted in Canada by CANMET, the research and development arm of
Energy, Mines and Resources Canada. With 10 houses built to suit various
climates, the program has been recognized for its use of recycled products,
energy efficiency, and appeal to the mass suburban market. One house is
noteworthy for its treatment of construction site waste. Enermodal
Engineering Ltd., Ontario, incorporated such shop-made components as precut
roof trusses, floor joists, and I-joists for wall studs into the house it
designed and built. Many waste products--particularly plastic--were sold to
a recycler. Steve Carpenter of Enermodal says construction generated only a
trash can full of debris.

The Center for Resourceful Building Technology (CRBT) in Missoula, Mont.,
has completed its second eco-house, a tiny (965-sq-ft) urban-infill
project. This Timber Tech project was designed to be replicated. ``We chose
resource-efficient and recycled materials that are currently available to
show builders and homeowners that they can improve the resource efficiency
of their construction right now,'' says Tracy Mumma, CRBT Research
Director. Inspired by an earlier CRBT project, architect Kate S. Warner has
completed ``a traditional New England house'' in Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,
using alternate materials and energy-efficient construction (below).

The house is not a solar collector
   What does it mean to build a green house? First and foremost it means
providing more energy-efficiency. How much more depends on the builder and
the client.

Nearly all architects and builders legitimately involved in the eco-house
movement create energy-conserving homes. It is no longer difficult or
risky. People want homes that use less energy and cost less to operate.
Builders have the technology readily available--technology that has been
around since the 1970s and 1980s when passive solar was aggressively
promoted, only to be pushed aside by the public for its unconventional and
often unappealing designs.

But passive-solar strategies and their attendant energy-conservation
measures are in fact major components of any house that purports to be
environmentally sensitive. Careful attention to building orientation,
direct heat gain, daylighting, shading, and well-insulated construction all
contribute to low energy consumption. The difference now is that most
designers create houses that look like houses, not like the result of an
aerospace experiment gone wrong.

The problems that plagued early passive-solar homes--lack of fresh air and
outgassing of materials--are being conquered in today's green buildings
through the use of forced fresh-air ventilation (with heat exchangers,
where warranted) and other measures that precondition outside air.

The house of green components
   While low energy use is a critical factor, it alone does not make a
house green. Products and materials that create less environmental impact
are also called for. Everything from the use of site-lumber scrap to
shredded-plastic Coke bottles are appearing in the eco-house.

Not all products are equally green. ``The way we look at it, every
environmental product and every eco-house advertised is a different shade
of green,'' says architect Greg Franta, of ENSAR Group, Boulder, Colo. A
long-time researcher into energy conservation and environmental issues
related to buildings, Franta regularly designs green buildings. Even with
his expertise, it isn't always easy to decide if one product is better than
another. Franta, like many environmental advocates, advises a ``cradle to
cradle'' analysis of products that considers the acquisition of the raw
materials; the processing and manufacturing process; the packaging and
distribution impacts; the installation, use and maintenance issues; and the
potential for disposal, reuse, or recycling.

Unfortunately, this is still not an easy task. Though numerous voluntary
and local certification programs exist, there is yet no widely accepted
certification system, database, or standard for what makes products green
[RECORD, October 1991, pages 36-39], though the Home Energy Rating Systems
Council is working on voluntary efficiency guidelines (202/638-3700). Like
Franta, Mike Nicklas of Innovative Design, Raleigh, N.C., is an architect
who has devoted his practice to designing energy-conserving buildings. He
hired an engineer to spend two years in his office researching various
building products and materials and rate them in terms of their effect on
the environment.

``The problem with our list is that it tends to be subjective,'' Nicklas
says. ``We try to get a good picture of the total embodied energy in a new
or recycled green product. We weigh the cost compared to other options.
But, ultimately, the decision to use a product or not rests with the
client.'' While the price of a few green products is actually lower than
conventional ones, others demand a premium, and others become more
affordable as the demand for them increases, explains Nicklas. In designing
a demonstration house for Ari-zona Public Utilities, Jones Studios weighed
``the quality of support by the company--the product most likely to be
readily available in the future and have strong backing from a stable
company.''

Widely used green products

Framing: Eco-houses are moving the home-building industry quickly away from
conventional timber (much of it from endangered old-growth forests) to a
variety of framing and panel products that use more abundant wood species
and incorporate material that was once scrap. Some designers are choosing
light-gauge steel framing, which can incorporate considerable recycled
content. Both have their pluses and minuses [RECORD, September 1995, pages
36-41].

Insulation: One of the most successful products is 100-percent
recycled-newspaper cellulose insulation. Ground into a paste-like pulp, the
cellulose is blown into walls and ceiling spaces. Its manufacture is
relatively benign. Indeed, even the ink gets recycled, points out
environmental and construction technology consultant David Johnston of
What's Working, Boulder, Colo.

Expanded-polystyrene rigid-foam insulation gets high marks from green
builders and designers because it doesn't involve ozone-depleting CFCs or
even the far superior but still ozone-depleting HCFC blowing agent. [For
more on insulation, see RECORD, April 1994, pages 34-35].

Finishes: Recycled plastic bags and hardwood fibers collected from
furniture waste and chopped-up building pallets are combined in an
environmentally friendly decking material, says Johnston. In addition to
being resource efficient, it can be softened and reformed. It will outlast
lumber used in the same application by a few decades. Carpeting made from
recycled PET plastic--the type used for water, soda, and ketchup
bottles--has also met with industry-wide approval. More than 100-million
yards have been laid in buildings to date, says Johnston. ``It is more
stain-resistant than nylon and wears better.''

Perhaps the most readily embraced green building product in housing has
been low-VOC paints. When first introduced, low-VOC paints cost upwards of
$30 per gallon. But once competition entered the market, prices were driven
down. It is selling in some states for about $17 per gal. to the trade. New
no-VOC paints are just entering the market.

Alternative products are being investigated or developed by manufacturers
of almost every type of building material and finish. One of the most
encouraging aspects of the push toward greener buildings is that a num-ber
of architects are experimenting with materials development. David Hertz of
Syndesis, Santa Monica, Calif., developed Syndecrete, a cement-based
compound that uses recycled materials as its primary ingredients
(opposite).

Despite the availability of increasingly reliable green products, Johnston
says that there's too much broad-brushed, marketing-driven green-washing by
too many in the homebuilding industry. ``A lot of builders will put up a
house with only one-half air change per hour, bad or non-existent energy
conservation, and materials that outgas toxins, yet incorporate low-VOC
paint and feel justified in calling it environmentally responsive or green.
The problem for the whole industry is that home buyers often don't know
what it is they don't know.''

In response, Johnston worked with the Colorado Home Builders Association
to establish the ``Green Builders Certification'' program--one of a number
of local certification programs that have recently developed.

IAQ vs energy efficiency
   If we learned nothing else from earlier waves of environmental and
energy-conserving design, it's that an approach that simply layers green
concepts or energy conservation onto conventional techniques can have
unintended consequences. The tightness of construction brought on by 70's
energy conservation is in part blamed for the indoor-air quality problems
of the 80's. Turning from wood studs to metal, warns Jim White of the
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, Ottawa, can cause mold growth, for
example. Writing in Environmental Building News, he claims the thermal
bridge created by a steel stud not fully enclosed by insulation can create
cold spots where high humidity from kitchens or bathrooms can condense,
encouraging mold growth within just a few months. In hot and humid regions,
mold grows within improperly designed walls when air-conditioned rooms draw
in outside air and airborne moisture condenses within the wall.

With most Americans spending up to 90 percent of their day inside their
homes or work places, a focus of eco-home design has become the condition
of the indoor environment. Rick Carter, of LBH Engineers and Architects,
Minneapolis, designed an eco-house for a client with multiple chemical
sensitivities. Although it had to be tailored to the specific clients'
sensitivities (page 014a), many of the strategies are finding their way
into the broader market.

Carter also designed the Minneapolis American Lung Association's Health
House, which is concerned with the increasing prevalence of asthma, which
it links to indoor-air quality. To eliminate pollutants, LBH minimized
materials that offgas toxics, including paint and carpet. It isolates
pollution sources by, for example, separating the garage from the house and
wrapping medium-density fiberboard in cabinets with plastic laminate. The
house is mechanically ventilated using 100-percent outside air (heat
exchangers capture heat and cooling from waste air). Still, it suffers from
its location amidst a suburban development. Original landscape plans called
for native plantings, but lost out to the developer's standard sod and
imported trees.

Looking at the bigger picture
   The limitations that Carter's site imposed are typical of the problems
many programs suffer--the inability to look at issues at a scale larger
than a single house. Yet a more holistic strategy, taking on site and
community-planning issues, is key to environmental sustainability.

One project that takes a broader view is the Arizona Public Service Company
Environmental Showcase Home in Phoenix, which was co-sponsored by EPA,
Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, and the Home Builders
Association of Central Arizona. Designed by Phoenix architect Jones Studio,
the project uses eco components like engineered wood and metal studs (on
interior walls). But it also uses shading and orientation, daylighting and
landscape concepts (previous pages).

From site planning to town planning
   Some communities are giving environmental mitigation high priority,
attempting to counteract the effects of suburban life built around the use
of the automobile. ``Pedestrian pocket'' and other traditional-development
strategies that emphasize transit use are already well known. Florida now
encourages compact development to reduce impacts on the state's endangered
Everglades. Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann architects, Washington D.C., have
gone so far as to banish the auto in the master plan the firm developed for
DeWees Island, S.C., a private, oceanfront retreat dedicated to
environmental preservation (below and opposite).

Many Americans seek a rural lifestyle, but the typical large-lot zoning in
resort and exurban areas encourages polluting car trips and fragments the
natural landscape. Environmental advocates say such broken-up natural areas
are less ecologically viable and more vulnerable to pests.

Loudon County, Va., decided to follow the advice of architect and planner
Richard Calderon, Leesburg, Va., to help preserve the rural quality of its
community. As an alternative to its three-acre lot zoning, the county has
approved a plan that allows hamlet developments. Houses in these hamlets
can be closely clustered on less than 20 percent of the site, leaving the
rest of the land in its natural state. They also encourage a more
neighborly form of country living. So encouraging is Loudon County's
environmental policy, that several developers are constructing
eco-villages. Franta of ENSAR is designing one hamlet of environmentally
oriented houses; Bethesda, Md.-based Hillier Reed and Neal Payton,
Washington, D.C., are doing another (below) that includes
narrower-than-standard streets to slow traffic.

Defining and assessing the environmental considerations that make a house
green remain complex. The key, say Alex Wilson and Nadav Malin, editors of
Environmental Building News, is to set priorities (RR1, Box 161,
Brattleboro, VT 05301, 802/257-7300). Their October 1995 issue offers a
checklist far less formidable for the smaller firm than the bible of
sustainability, AIA's Environmental Resource Guide (now published and
updated by John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 800/225-5945). See Manufacturers
Resources in this issue for additional information about the projects
mentioned in this story.

   Dallas builder Barbara Harwood of BBH Enterprises markets ``affordable''
eco homes. Esperanza del Sol (bottom) comprises two rows of six 1,270-sq-ft
houses clustered around a shared green space. Each three-bedroom, two-bath
house is insulated (with cellulose) far in excess of Dallas' standard
practice. Lumber use was minimized by framing 24-in. o.c. with 2 by 6
studs. Natural ventilation, roof overhangs, and daylighting all contribute
to Harwood's confidence that her $79,000 homes won't cost more than $300 a
year to heat and cool. She even offers to guarantee it. Architect Kate
Warner's educational efforts around ReCraft East (right) focus on the
numerous alternative products this traditional-looking house contains--from
fly ash in the concrete to salvaged-wood flooring, and beer-barrel stave
cabinets.

Illustration: One Photograph and One Plan: Form follows fresh air
   David Hertz, of Syndesis, Santa Monica, Calif., not only developed
Syndecrete (a cement-based compound that uses recycled materials as its
primary ingredients), he'll use it for various surfaces at the Lehrer house
(right). The house also incorporates numerous other environmentally
preferable alternative products--from recycled rigid-board insulation to
nails with recycled content. Since carpet is avoided, an efficient
radiant-heating system is installed in the floors. Low-flow and
water-conserving plumbing fixtures are specified.

He uses architectural form to focus prevailing breezes. A tower-like
element draws hot air up, exhausting it in the summer and recycling it
(through a heat-recovery unit) in the winter. The hvac has an advanced
control system that allows more effective zoning of heating and cooling
throughout the house.

Illustration: One Photograph and One Plan: An environmental island
   Charged with minimizing environmental impact at DeWees Island, S.C.,
Burt Hill Kosar Rittelmann limited development to 150 homes (right) and
banished petroleum-fueled cars in favor of electric golf carts (no golf
course is allowed, though). Sand paths replace roads.

All house designs must be approved by an architectural review board, which
encourages regional architectural devices such as wide overhangs and
wrap-around porches. Structures are mounted on pilings, reducing impact on
flora and fauna, and permitting hurricane-driven storm surges to pass
harmlessly underneath. Only five percent of the island can be built upon,
and housing must be clustered in the maritime forest on the southwest
corner of the island (lower left in plan).

Conservation of water is encouraged, fertilizers discouraged, and use of
recycled building products required. The Reeves residence, a house that
meets all of these criteria, was recently completed by North Carolina
architect Design Harmony (opposite left).

Illustration: Two Photographs and One Plan: An environmental hamlet
   Sunnyslope, in Loudon County, Va., is a ``hamlet'' plan posed as an
alternative to the kind of large-lot development that encourages traffic
problems in rural and exurban areas. Bill Reed of Hillier Reed, Bethesda,
Md., and Neal Payton, Washington, D.C., have clustered 30 homes (which
follow their own environmental guidelines), leaving much of the site's 150
acres unencumbered. Following traditional neighborhood development
precedents, the hamlet's streets are designed more like country lanes. A
community building and a town green offer a civic focus.

   The Tamarack Point subdivision, near Colorado Springs, is similar to
many green building programs in that it incorporates many alternative
products (engineered wood, recycled-plastic carpet) while sticking close to
what competitors offer in terms of design and price (1, 2 right). The
models are built by Habitat Design and Construction.

Indoor-air-quality issues merited special attention in a Minnesota house
for a client with chemical sensitivities, designed by LBH Engineers and
Architects (3, 4). After the firm researched products, ``the client
actually took materials to the doctor and tested each one,'' says Rick
Carter of LBH. ``Sometimes we had to construct a sample because it
contained a composite material, or something had to be painted and
tested.''

Tile was used instead of carpet; the detached garage minimizes infiltration
of carbon-monoxide; slab-on-grade construction avoided mold-growth from a
basement. The architects even provided doors with large glass areas because
the client is sensitive to softwoods.

Photograph: Three Photographs: Considering climate and landscape
   The showcase house Jones Studio designed for Arizona Public Service (an
electrical utility) goes well beyond those eco-homes that merely substitute
products within a conventional envelope. It's oriented so that thick
masonry walls will absorb Phoenix's fierce direct thermal gain. (They are
insulated with polyurethane foamed without CFCs.) Expressive overhangs
catch breezes and shade the interior from direct sun, while permitting
useful daylight (kitchen and ``great'' room with den beyond--2).

Through such techniques, reliance on energy from fossil fuels is reduced
far beyond the norm. The building envelope saves 30 percent of the energy
used in a typical new energy-efficient house, and is insulated far in
excess of standard practice. The number of windows on east-west exposures
was minimized to enhance energy efficiency; north- and south-facing windows
are grouped to provide plenty of daylight and views. Ecological strategies
extend to the outside. Natural desert plants were used to reduce landscape
water needs, and subsurface irrigation reduces loss of water by
evaporation. Rainwater combined with household gray water is collected for
all landscape watering.

INTRODUCTION

By:
Karen D. Stein

Trying, as correspondent Beth Dunlop reports, to turn ``fiction into
fact,'' the Walt Disney Company has embarked on an ambitious program to
invent a town that resembles one of its own moving-picture fantasies of
American small-town life--Norman Rockwell writ large. Located near Orlando,
Florida, and that ultimate destination spot, Walt Disney World, the
feel-good-named town of Celebration is literally on the rise, with a master
plan by Robert A.M. Stern Architects and Cooper Robertson & Partners and
major downtown buildings by an all star-cast of architects: a Whitman's
Sampler of design (pages 64-69). The first completed project in Celebration
is an office complex by Aldo Rossi of Italy, his first building in the U.S.
(pages 56-63).

While the impressive array of planners and architects has tackled issues of
modest-price housing in Celebration, this month's Building Types Study
(Number 733) on affordable housing presents an even tougher reality, where
amenity, cost-efficiency, and design sensitivity are in a constant
three-way tug-of-war (pages 86-95).

Sensitivity to an existing and beloved historical context--one that, as
Aaron Betsky writes, is ``an inspired merger of monastery and Mission
Style''--is a recurring theme on the growing campus of Stanford University
and one that San Francisco firm Tanner Leddy Maytum Stacy managed to
address while producing a truly Modern addition to the school's engineering
department (pages 70-75), also paving the way for Norman Foster's
competition win of a medical building last month. The evolution of a
different kind of campus has been the long-time preoccupation of French
architect Paul Andreu, who for 30 years has helped guide the development
and expansion of the Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris (pages 76-85).
His goal has been to avoid what he calls ``the tendency in Modern
architecture for a building to have just one unifying concept.''

THE CROSSROADS OF FRANCE
The Exchange Module is the heart of one of the most sophisticated
transportation hubs in the world.

By:
Claire Downey

The intersection of a high-speed rail line, airport, and urban transit
system occurs at the new Exchange Module at France's Charles de Gaulle
Airport. Opened in 1994, the module serves the recently built perimeter TGV
(trains grande vitesse) line skirting eastern Paris. Built to circumvent
lengthy connections from one inner-city station to another, the new line,
and its airport link, renew Paris's competitive edge as an international
transportation center.

The exchange module is really two projects in one--a train station, plus
the multi-level pedestrianway--and is the latest but certainly not the last
element in French architect Paul Andreu's collaboration with the Aeroports
de Paris. Andreu has designed the entire Charles de Gaulle Airport, and his
new project creates a point of relief in its masterplan. The module uses
dramatic structural design to create unencumbered circulation and, although
monumental, there is a quality of light and weightlessness about it that
contrasts with the density of its concrete neighbors.

For this latest project, Andreu renewed his collaboration with the engineer
Peter Rice (who died in 1992), and Rice's Paris office, RFR. Through shared
discussions, Andreu and Rice conceived of a space that would stay away
``from the simplistic idea,'' or as Andreu explains, ``the tendency in
modern architecture for a building to have just one unifying concept.''
Instead, the elliptical 260-room hotel extends the existing poured-concrete
architectural language of Terminal 2--the transparency of the hotel's
atrium becomes a skylight for the exchange terminal--and is an elegant
counterpoint for the transparency of the train station. The linkage was
simplified by the design of the air terminal itself. In plan, Terminal 2
resembles an elongated figure-eight. In choosing the narrow juncture
between existing segments and the future loop of Terminal 3, Andreu
underlaid the perpendicular axis of the 1,600-foot-long train station.

The winged glass roofs of the train platforms are, from every angle, the
focus of the project. Andreu wanted the roof to appear to float, and he
wanted users to be able to see out and be bathed in light. RFR developed a
cantilevered tubular-support structure, which is quite dense. The visual
complexity is diminished by the design of distinct, readable layers. ``It
was part of Rice's concept,'' explains RFR project director Hugh Dutton,
``to establish a hierarchy, with each element having its own identity.''
The sweep of the roof unifies the complex human movements within.
Passengers transfer from commuter-rail lines to plane, plane to train, or
even Terminal 2 to Terminal 3. Each transport system occupies its own
level, and the openness of the scheme gives passengers a clear idea of
where they are and where they need to go. Its architecture, punctuated by
escalators, seating, and banks of monitors, is almost a blank slate. The
eye is not drawn to the open interior space, but outward, either to the
animated roof of the train station, or the airplanes on the tarmac. The
fact that the glass train-station roofs slope up toward the hotel above
allows a protected inside-outside view. Daylight enters from the north and
south and, and at night, light levels are kept below the glare threshold so
often exceeded in transportation centers.

The openness of the project helps alleviate stress by constantly
re-orienting passengers as they move through the Module. Andreu is against
all that clutters transportation spaces: advertising, piped-in music;
anything that can be referred to as animation. Fortunately, he has included
a cafe and newspaper stand along with the train ticketing counter on Level
2, since the TGV passes infrequently. In terms of train traffic, the
suburban train into Paris, whose four lines parallel the TGV, is more
important. Still, Andreu has preserved a sense of calm that almost allows
this 216,000-square-foot building to seem intimate.

Illustration: Plan: A changing master plan
   Charged with the master planning of the entire airport, as well as the
architecture of its main buildings, Andreu was able to introduce an
architecture for the train station that counterpoints the existing parts of
Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 (currently under construction). The architecture
of the terminals has evolved over time, changing from a one-story plan to a
two-story plan for the latest terminal which will handle more traffic. In
addition to the central passenger drop-off road, automated shuttle cars
will take voyagers from the exchange terminal to the most distant Terminal
1.

Illustration: Two Plans: Circulation and structure
   The complexity of the exchange terminal and train station was simplified
by analyzing each piece separately. The linear train lines, the lobby of
the hotel, the inter-terminal transport, the pedestrian concourses, and the
parallel access roads are visually distinct. Each element, like the glazed
steel roof of the train station, can be further divided into separate and
simply designed parts. A close-up of the 2,200-ton structure (below) shows
the barely-curved plane of the roof separated from the crescent-shaped
trusses by tubular vertical compression struts. Prestressed cables anchor
the end of each truss.

Illustration: Four Photographs and Four Plans: Two rows of spoke-like
pylons support the train-station roof (top opposite), one on each side of
the crescent-shaped trusses so that their identity is distinct. Each pylon
base rests on a pin-joint covered by a steel casting that allows movement
while guaranteeing constant compression.

By using fritted glass for the roof, light is diffused, and the sensation
of looking into a dark structural underbelly is avoided.

The non-loadbearing walls, separated from the roof by a four-foot air space
(bottom left opposite), are transparent, allowing a view of airplanes. The
facade system keeps the glass surface free from mullions by using
drilled-through fittings on branch-like arms attached to vertical masts.

Plans show the intersection between the train lines and air terminals, the
genesis of the Exchange Module. Moving up from the train platforms to the
the intermediate lobby, then up to level two, the traveler arrives at the
main waiting area, shops, and ticketing.

At the upper level, four moving sidewalks take passengers to the adjacent
air terminals. Prow-shaped walls support the hotel located above.

THE CROSSROADS OF FRANCE: UP CLOSE

By:
Claire Downey

Andreu the master builder. For French architect Paul Andreu, the evolution
of Charles de Gaulle airport has been a 30-year preoccupation. As a young
engineering graduate still working on his architecture degree in the 1960s,
Andreau took a job with the Aeroports de Paris (ADP) working on the
masterplan of the new airport. By the time he was 29 and an architect, he
was designing the airport's first terminal. It was a chance he got through
luck, long hours and, he admits, by being a little competitive. The design,
a segmented circle where passengers move through suspended transport tubes,
became a symbol of late-Modern architecture. Coming from nowhere at a time
when few French architects were interested in airport design, Andreu found
himself in the spotlight, but also on the defensive: reviewers at the time
were unsure whether this was architecture or engineering. Isolated by the
debate, Andreau opted to stay on with ADP. Now that airport commissions are
prized by the world's top architects, Andreu's positions with ADP is
enviable. His career in transportation design has not only developed
internationally, but with the completion of the Grande Arche at La Defense
(after the death of Johann Otto van Spreckelsen), one of Paris's grands
projets, and his museum in Osaka, Japan, Andreu is finding a new audience
for his architecture.

DESIGNS ON THE FUTURE

``The combination of celebrated architects with the less well-known (and
the corresponding combination of instant landmarks with modest vernacular
buildings) makes [Disney's new] town kind of a Columbus, Indiana, meets
Columbus, Georgia,'' writes Beth Dunlop.

By:
Beth Dunlop

One sunny Saturday last November, a crowd gathered under a vast tent for an
afternoon's entertainment. It wasn't a circus or a concert, but a lottery
drawing to determine who would be eligible to buy into the Walt Disney
Company's new town, Celebration. Among the hopefuls, interestingly enough,
were several top officials of the Disney Development Corporation (DDC).
They had to take their chances just like everyone else; more than 3,500
potential home-buyers were vying for one of Celebration's first 300 houses
or apartments.

Neo-traditional towns have been an important area of design and inquiry
among architects for the last decade. The first of these--notably, Seaside,
Florida; Kentlands, Maryland; and Laguna West, California--have garnered
their share of critical and popular admiration. Now Disney is building one
of its own. Despite its somewhat frivolous-sounding name, Celebration is a
serious effort to grapple with ideas about the nature and future of
neighborhood, community, and town planning; and it is also an effort to
show that new development can be accountable to environmental and
ecological concerns. It is to be, in the words of DDC vice president for
community development, Don Killoren, ``sustainable and holistic.''

Celebration reflects its creators aspirations. Disney CEO Michael Eisner
hopes that it will provide a ``prototype for the millennium'' by offering
quality of life and intellectual content in addition to practical
conveniences. Eisner pins great hopes on the school--a public experimental
kindergarten through twelfth-grade institution that incorporates a
teacher-training academy--as a way to set the town apart. For his part, DDC
president Peter Rummell wants Celebration to change the perception of the
company as a pure entertainment conglomerate: ``It's going to be a place
that deals with real-world issues and real-world problems, but deals with
them in a relevant way.''

A place called Celebration
   Celebration sits just outside of the sprawling acreage known as Walt
Disney World, near Orlando, Florida. Before embarking on this project, DDC
got the site formally removed from the Reedy Creek Improvement District
(which provides everything ranging from electric power to police protection
to the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, MGM Studios, the water attractions, the
offices, the shopping complexes, and the hotels). Celebration isn't part of
that Disney domain; instead, it is in Osceola County, which will provide
public services from sewers to schools. To build the town, Disney received
the most comprehensive development permit the state of Florida had ever
issued, says Tom Lewis, DDC's vice president for development.

Eventually, the town will have 8,000 houses compactly arranged around a
``downtown'' and more expected Florida-style amenities, such as a golf
course and tennis courts; Disney is spending approximately $100 million on
infrastructure and development. Celebration encompasses just about 10,000
acres, but of that only half is buildable. The rest is protected wetlands,
and home to numerous protected animal and plant species. The town will have
eight miles of trails for hiking or biking, a model school with the latest
in educational equipment, and a ``health campus'' that is both fitness
center and hospital. It already has its own zip code, Celebration, Florida,
34747.

In the role of master-planners Celebration's chief architects are Robert
A.M. Stern and Jaquelin Robertson, who not only created the town plan, but
are also carefully nurturing it into being. The plan itself is derived from
a number of small-town sources, but it is also adapted to its boggy
tropical terrain. It springs, too, from a number of philosophical and
pragmatic ideas about American town planning, from the sequence of spaces
to the role of the backyard. Stern, who, not incidentally, is also a member
of the company's board of directors, and Robertson are shepherding this
town into being with such thoroughness that they have even had a hand in
the design of the light fixtures and street signs to be sure they ``say
Celebration,'' at least symbolically.

Their design for Celebration is not, its authors say, ``ideological,'' but
rather based on the idea that the best American towns are also, in
Robertson's words, ``places people love to go to.'' Of course, Walt Disney
World is the most-visited place in the known universe, so Celebration has a
head start. To begin with, 27,000 visitors stopped in at the cleverly
designed information center (by the graphics and design firm, Pentagram)
within the first three months it was open.

Crossbreeding, Celebration-style
   The town will have compact neighborhoods and house designs drawn from a
host of recast historicist Southern regional styles. Robertson terms this
``the crossbreeding of architecture styles in America.'' Modernism is
noticeably absent; Stern and Robertson believe that American small towns
lost their vitality after World War II. Maintains Robertson: ``Celebration
is really a kind of a testimony to that crossbreeding and our kind of
editing and selection of those town settings that we thought were most
successful and most emblematic.''

Celebration also boasts an exclusive, marquee-level cast of architects. The
plan from Stern and Robertson had early contributions by Duany and
Plater-Zyberk Architects, and Gwathmey Siegel and Associates. The town hall
was designed by Philip Johnson. Next door will be a post office by Michael
Graves. Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown are designing the bank; Cesar
Pelli & Associates, the cinema, and Graham Gund, a hotel. William Rawn has
designed Celebration's model school. The late Charles Moore designed the
town's ``preview center,'' and it is to be built posthumously. Robertson's
firm, Cooper Robertson & Partners, is designing the town's golf clubhouse.

Celebration's only completed structures--an office complex to house DDC,
among other tenants--were designed by Aldo Rossi [see previous article].
Adjacent to the Rossi complex will be the health campus, which Stern is
designing. Stern and Robertson have each developed a number of other town
buildings, but the houses themselves will be done by many regional
architects, among them Derrick Smith and Lidia Abella of Miami; McCall and
Turner of Moultrie, Ga.; John Robbins of Oxford, Miss.; Al Jones of Baton
Rouge; Historic Concepts, Inc. of Peachtree City, Ga.; and UDA of
Pittsburgh. The combination of celebrated architects with the less
well-known (and the corresponding combination of instant landmarks with
modest vernacular buildings) makes the town itself kind of a Columbus,
Indiana, meets Columbus, Georgia.

Celebration celebrates what its architects know best
   From the beginning, Stern and Robertson were mindful of the admonition
that architects, like writers, are at their best when their work is based
on what they know. Both Stern and Robertson, as New Yorkers, also have
weekend homes in the Long Island beach town of Easthampton, a place that
they both admire greatly. ``Easthampton seemed to Robert and me to have
almost all of the touchstones of early American urbanism in its earliest
phases and yet every practical issue was addressed in the plan,'' said
Robertson, convenience of observation notwithstanding.

Disney's in-house architects, as well as Ray Gindroz from UDA and Stern and
Robertson, in fact did visit numerous early American towns, many of them in
the South, as part of the extensive research done for Celebration over the
past decade. One young DDC employee--armed with a recent master's in
architecture and a camera--was sent off to photograph every appealing
building or public space he could find in historic towns in the Southeast.

Still, unlike early American town builders, Disney had a host of regulatory
issues as well as environmental and ecological considerations to grapple
with, from the preservation of wetlands that are home to such threatened or
endangered species as the American bald eagle and the Florida gopher
tortoise to the saving of what Stern termed the ``significant trees'' on
the site. The saved trees gave the plan additional shape. In one spot,
houses circle a cluster of trees left in place as a natural landmark. Each
of Celebration's neighborhoods, in fact, revolves around what Stern terms a
``significant public space.''

Charming and car-friendly
   Some of those public spaces--in the downtown, for example--are fully
hospitable to cars. Unlike many quaint 19th-century towns with narrow,
cobbled roads, Celebration's streets are engineered to accommodate
automobiles. Its neighborhoods are precisely arranged to offer walking
distances (between homes and shops, homes and school), a recognition of a
late 20th-century suburban culture in which people drive to the health club
to walk on a treadmill or take the elevator up to climb on the stair
master. ``While we're all interested in traditional towns,'' says Stern,
``this is a representation of that search to recapture the traditional
town. We are all very mindful that this is being built at the end of the
20th century, so the town is traditional in spirit but modern in terms of
what we know about how people live.''

Thus, though outwardly Celebration will rely on a host of architectural and
symbolic gestures to the past, signs of being high-tech, in fact, abound.
Each of its eventual 8,000 houses will be linked to the outside world (town
hall, hospital, school) by an advanced fiber-optic system. The school (run
jointly by Osceola County and Stetson University) is to get an infusion of
the latest equipment and technology from Disney.

The plan places special emphasis on returning streets and sidewalks to the
public realm. The main street, called Water Street (Osceola County already
had a ``Main Street'' and Celebration couldn't reuse the name), is
conceived as a broad, tree-lined boulevard, ``the town stroll.'' The
peripheral road, called Golfpark Drive, has houses only on one side as in
Easthampton, and the golf course is entirely visible from the road--making
it public green space, at least visually. Special attention was paid to the
design of the 15-foot-wide sidewalks, which Stern calls ``the principle
component of the public realm.'' Stern and Robertson were adamant about the
inclusion of alleys for a host of architectural and sociological reasons.
Robertson likes to think of many of the town's elements--the golf course
with no houses fronting on it or the alleys--as ``radical old notions'' of
town planning.

The downtown is conceived as an old-fashioned town center, with a
combination of commercial, office, and residential space. The town hall,
post office, bank, and preview center are all intended as civic standouts,
buildings that will be recognized by and, it is hoped, for their
architecture. Stern and Robertson are providing the fabric around the
landmarks: they essentially divvied up the rest of the downtown buildings
half-and-half, and they are cloaked in the hybrid American style that
conjures up lots of non-specific memories. ``We predicated our design on
the notion that American towns had a life before the 1940s, basically, up
until World War II, so the buildings take their inspiration up to the
1940s,'' says Stern.

Designing by the book
   The architects and builders of Celebration's houses must work within the
guidelines of a hefty and handsome ``pattern book,'' based on similar books
published in the early part of this century. Pittsburgh architect Ray
Gindroz, of the firm Urban Design Associates, is its author. It delineates
the basic elements of ``the Celebration house''--front facade, back yard,
side wings, porches--and outlines the six architectural styles and possible
configurations allowed in the town's first phase. The styles are defined as
Classical, Victorian, Colonial Revival, Coastal, Mediterranean, and French.
The pattern book is a kit of parts in a way, with numerous potential
combinations of roof profiles, finish materials, windows, and ornament.
``Instead of telling people what they shouldn't do, we are telling people
what they can do,'' said Gindroz.

Some buyers at Celebration may bring in his their own architects, while
others will choose from those offered by the developers. Everybody, though,
must respect such rules as the height of the cornice line (``absolutely
critical in creating the quality of the public space,'' claims Gindroz) and
the placement of fences and hedges along the street. Although, Celebration
is a town in name, it will not immediately be self-governed (Disney will
own most of the public space and all of the commercial buildings); thus,
strict controls can be kept over paint colors, renovations, and even the
placement of screened porches and pool enclosures.

A highway runs through it
   Its site has a certain high visibility. It is just off Highway 192, the
southerly approach to Walt Disney World and a road lined with every
imaginable (and some likely beyond easy imagining) fast-food restaurant,
motel chain, souvenir shop, themed shopping center, and family
entertainment offering. Stern calls it ``the sleaze road of all times.''
Rossi's rather sophisticated office complex sits along Highway 192, as will
Stern's hospital. After DDC had designated this off-site site for
Celebration, the Florida Department of Transportation decided it needed to
run a connector road through it, which will separate the town from the
office complex and hospital. The addition of this road makes Celebration at
once more accessible to the outside world and less so, in that it will be
difficult to go on foot to and from the adjacent health facilities and
office buildings. The new road is, at best, a mixed blessing and one that
gives Celebration a full-fledged late 20th-century pedigree, the new town
by the expressway.

Model town or company town?
   And unlike many new housing developments, Celebration is not a gated
community, nor is it oppressively expensive. ``Our emphasis,'' says
Killoren, ``is on diversity. We don't have distinctions between the haves
and have-nots here.'' Indeed, at Celebration, the top-end lots (called
``estate'' lots) are a stone's throw from the townhouses, which will sell
for prices ranging upwards of $120,000, and rental apartments downtown.
Still, a criticism leveled by some is that even at that lowest price range,
Celebration-living is out of reach for many of Disney's low-end employees.
``It is not a cure-all,'' says Eisner. ``It's a way of trying to make a
town.''

Disney, for its part, is adamant about not letting this be a company town.
The philosophical emphasis on diversity means more than just economic or
ethnic diversity, which is why employees had to take their chances in the
lottery just like everybody else (a father of three, DDC's Killoren, for
example, drew number 97 in the estate lots lottery; another top DDC
executive wanted a cottage lot and most likely won't get it on the first
round).

The future resembles the past
   All of Disney's theme-park environments--from the various ``lands'' and
rides to the hotels--are somehow idealized. When Walt Disney designed the
first Main Street for Disneyland in 1955, he said he was basing it on his
hometown of Marcelline, Missouri, but Disney was idealizing the
turn-of-the-century American small town main street, turning fact into
fiction. A decade later, in the mid-1960s when Walt Disney was buying up
Central Florida swampland for his second theme park venture, his interests
had jumped from past to future. His goal was a futuristic model community
he called EPCOT (originally, EPCOT was an acronym for Experimental
Prototype Community of Tomorrow). Thus, while others were drawing up Main
Street and Cinderella's castle, he was thinking bigger thoughts about
finding a solution to urban chaos. He envisioned EPCOT sitting under a
bubble of glass, with high-speed monorails zipping residents of this
high-tech town from home to work and back again--a sleek and hermetic world
of the future. Disney's idea died with him in 1966.

But now we know the future is, at least partly, in the past and it's to be
found at Celebration, not at EPCOT. Says Stern: ``Ironically, it is Main
Street [in the Magic Kingdom] that was the actual genius of American
urbanism recaptured.'' Now Main Street, Disney-style, moves into the
mainstream in Celebration where, perhaps, the process will be reversed, and
the fiction and fantasy of small-town life will be turned back into fact.

THE MASTERPLAN

By:
Beth Dunlop

Celebration's town plan is both defined and circumscribed by natural
conditions. Roughly half of its 10,000 acres is protected wetlands, which
creates a greenbelt and allows for uninterrupted vistas through the trees.

The plan focuses on a new lake, part of a system of canals and waterways
that provides for storm-water runoff and gives the town a visual focal
point. The town center nests along the lakefront, and the residential
neighborhoods fan out from there. In Celebration's first phase of
construction, everyone will be within walking distance of the shops and
restaurants.

A strongly hierarchical road system gives further definition: broad
boulevards; narrower, winding roads; straight streets; back alleys;
pedestrian walkways; and bicycle paths. At the periphery is Golfpark Drive,
with houses on one side and rolling greens on the other--a device both
esthetic and democratic in intent. Leaving the golf course accessible gives
Celebration a strongly defined open space so everyone--not just a
privileged few who can afford adjacent houses--gets the view. Another bold
gesture in the plan is the broad boulevard that cuts a swath through
Celebration and is intended as the town's promenade. It is Water Street, a
reference to the stream that will run through its median strip.
(Celebration had to take street names that were not already in use in
Osceola County, which was no small task in the generally cutesy world that
is Orlando and its vicinity. Most were already in use, leaving the rather
old-fashioned Sycamore, Honeysuckle, Elderberry, and Mulberry.)

Each residential neighborhood focuses on a special spatial feature: a
circle, a square, a protected strand of trees, or the waterway. These
features, in turn, give shape and character to their neighborhoods and, say
the architects, definition and subtlety to the plan.

DOWNTOWN CELEBRATION

By:
Beth Dunlop

Downtown Celebration is intended as a place to live, work, shop, eat, and
play. It is also conceived as an ode to late 20th-century architecture: its
primary buildings have been designed by architects who achieved fame in the
1970s and 80's. It includes a town hall by Philip Johnson, a post office by
Michael Graves, a bank by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, a cinema
by Cesar Pelli, and a ``preview center'' by the late Charles Moore. Most of
the other downtown buildings are by the firms of Celebration's chief
planners Robert A.M. Stern and Jaquelin Robertson. An inn, not in the first
phase, is by Graham Gund.

The all-star lineup was the brainchild of Disney's chief architect Wing
Chao. He told Disney CEO Michael Eisner and DDC president Peter Rummell
that since the town would be in the spotlight ``we needed an all-star team
for our first line-up, if you'll forgive the football analogy.'' Eisner
says he ``loved the idea of having us challenged by others on the outside
and being pushed to excellence''

RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS

By:
Beth Dunlop

Celebration's residential structures are governed by a hefty, 74-page,
portfolio-size ``pattern book,'' based on similar guidelines published
early in the century. The book is largely the work of Ray Gindroz of the
Pittsburgh firm, Urban Design Associates, in association with Disney
Development Corporation, Robert A.M. Stern Architects, and Cooper Robertson
& Partners.

The pattern book is not simply a blueprint. It sets forth the
philosophical, historical, and architectural premises that inspired
Celebration and establishes some basic principles and definitions to guide
all development.

A number of elements of the town are strictly controlled, among them the
building massing, the placement of side wings and porches, the height of
the cornice line. The urbanism of Celebration depends on the relationship
of house and yard (bounded by a fence or hedge) to the sidewalk. The
pattern book prescribes this relationship to create a clear distinction
between the private, domestic realm of the house and the public realm of
streets, sidewalks, and squares.

Celebration will have six accepted building styles--Classical, Victorian,
Colonial Revival, Coastal (a melding of French Colonial and ``low country''
architectural traditions), Mediterranean, and French. The styles are drawn
from Southern domestic and vernacular architecture, and are the result of
studying such towns as Charleston, Beaufort, and Mount Pleasant, S.C. Early
buyers seemed to favor the Coastal house, with its wraparound porches, and
the somewhat grander Classical models.

Celebration's houses will not necessarily be true styles, letter- perfect
in their authenticity. Rather, they will be composites of those typically
found in small-town neighborhoods that have evolved over the years, though
the pattern book carefully lays out mandatory ``key elements'' and
appropriate detailing for each style. Within this are endless combinations
of windows and doors, porches, and loggias.

To add to the mix, there are four basic sizes of Celebration lots:
``estate'' (though presiding over lots typically 90 by 130 feet and not, as
the name suggests, vast rolling acreage), ``village'' (to accommodate a
regular house), ``cottage'' (for a slightly smaller ``empty nest'' or
``starter'' house) and ``townhouse.''

The pattern book also spells out acceptable materials, which intentionally
differ somewhat among the styles to provide texture to each neighborhood.
There is also a palette of approved Celebration paint colors and a guide to
preferred plants and trees. All of this is aimed at achieving the tricky
balance of making Celebration seem at once coherent and diverse, as if the
town simply grew all on its own.

PLACE MAKING
Aldo Rossi gives monumental presence to Disney's development company,
creator of the new Florida town of Celebration

By:
Karen D. Stein

Central Florida's flat sawgrass-rimmed landscape in no way suggests the
Italian town of Pisa, except to the mind of Aldo Rossi, whose leap of
imagination has linked them in spirit, giving this instant town an instant
landmark. The plan of Rossi's office complex, the first project to be built
in the Walt Disney Company-sponsored new town of Celebration, was inspired
by Pisa's main square, the Piazza dei Miracoli or ``square of miracles,'' a
green lawn punctuated by a sculptural mix of buildings. Rossi says the
reference makes a connection between his project and ``a sense of the
infinite within history and nature.'' While only the first phase of Rossi's
scheme is now complete--two contiguous buildings and a garden pavilion that
temporarily occupies the site of a proposed third office block--already
there's a there in a place that Rossi's American partner Morris Adjmi aptly
calls ``the middle
of nowhere.''

Rossi, author of the famed The Architecture of the City, has succeeded in
injecting an urbane presence into the sprawl of highways and strip-shopping
malls that surround Celebration, a satellite of Orlando and that ultimate
destination, Walt Disney World. While Rossi's reputation as an ivory-tower
academic might seem at odds with profit- driven Disney, his architecture
proves that theorist and practitioner can co-exist. Rossi's simple but
powerful forms are an artful combination of lucid and familiar shapes, are
easy to build, and, given the correct choice of materials, inexpensive.
(Rossi's popularity among practitioners and students of architecture in
this country would suggest that his first project in the United States
would be an academic institution. The economy said otherwise: Rossi's 1986
design of the School of Architecture at the University of Miami remains
unbuilt for lack of funding.)

For many architects who seek to work at a scale equal to their ambitious
vision, Disney, with its deep pockets and the rare inclination to invest in
architecture, has become an accepted, if not coveted client. Nonetheless,
Rossi's first collaboration with the company, a competition entry for the
first phase of the Euro Disney amusement park and resort in 1988, did not
yield built results. Rossi's interest in American vernacular styles seemed
to dovetail nicely with the company's man-date for themed entertainment.
During design development of the Hotel New Orleans, however, Rossi balked
at a process that ranked the architect somewhere amidst consultants and
efficiency experts. The parting was amicable. Three years later, an office
building, with its more obvious program requirements and straightforward
floorplates, reunited client and architect in their traditional roles.

Though Rossi was unaware of the specific plans for Celebration as his
project began [see the article that follows for an overview of
Celebration], his complex, located just south of a highway, has proved to
be an effective billboard of sorts for the town that is sprouting up just
beyond the confines of his 30-acre site. The two buildings, with their
giant-scale column grids and hefty cornice lines, convey a seriousness of
purpose ideally suited to a $2.5-billion development that Disney hopes will
serve as a model for future new towns. The buildings are also an apt symbol
for a principal tenant, the Disney Development Company, which, led by its
president Peter Rummell and chief architect Wing Chao, has invested
millions on famous and not-so-famous architects and continues to commission
projects at a prodigious rate, banking on architecture as a sellable
attraction. For Rossi the commission has a more poetic connotation: ``I've
come to understand the vastness of America.''

PLACE MAKING: UP CLOSE

By:
Karen D. Stein

Planning for the future. Aldo Rossi's masterplan for the Celebration Place
office complex (drawing below) calls for replacing the demountable garden
pavilion or ``folly'' (at left in photo opposite bottom) with a bar-like
building that completes the U-shaped ring of the first phase. Eventually,
two structures will be added across the street--a total of five buildings
on a grassy plain criss-crossed by pedestrian walkways and surrounded by
parking lots. Rossi and the New York City outpost of his Milan-based Studio
di Architettura studied several planning and massing scenarios, including a
scheme to locate the office blocks atop a shared parking base, an approach
that would have enhanced the monumentality of the complex.

While Rossi favored the plinth in other projects he was developing at the
time--the Hotel Il Palazzo in Fukuoka, Japan [RECORD, May 1990, pages
70-78], and the still unbuilt School of Architecture at the University of
Miami--the cost of subterranean construction was out of line with the
modest Disney budget. (The two completed buildings came in at $65 per
square foot for the shells and lobbies. Associate architect Smallwood,
Reynolds, Stewart, Stewart & Associates did the interiors.) Other proposals
discarded after closer scrutiny, reports Rossi's partner Morris Adjmi,
include adding a road on axis into the courtyard. ``Too rigid,'' says
Adjmi.

STANFORD'S NEW STYLE
Charles B. Thornton Center for Engineering Management
Stanford University Palo Alto, California
Tanner Leddy Maytum Stacy, Architects

By:
Aaron Betsky

Stucco walls and red-tile roofs, arches and colonnades, courtyards filled
with live oak trees: that's the idiom of Stanford University. Ever since it
was founded by Leland Stanford in 1885, and laid out by Frederick Law
Olmsted with buildings by Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge in an inspired merger
of monastery and Mission style, architects have been trying to figure out
how to adapt the imagery of one of the country's most prestigious academic
institutions to changing uses, technologies, and perceptions. Now a new
slate of buildings is modernizing the vocabulary with some unexpected
materials. Under the direction of Campus Architect David Neuman, who
previously turned the University of California at Irvine into an
architectural showpiece, Stanford has hired the likes of Robert A.M. Stern,
Antoine Predock, Ricardo Legoretta, and Henry Cobb of Pei, Cobb, Freed &
Partners to expand its architectural vision. The harbinger of this wave is
a simple shed designed by Bill Leddy of the San Francisco firm, Tanner
Leddy Maytum Stacy.

The Charles B. Thornton Center for Engineering Management is a
12,000-square-foot addition to the 1977 Frederick Emmons Termon Engineering
Building. Designed by Harry Weese, this much beloved (by its inhabitants)
essay in ``engineers' esthetic'' itself tried to update the vocabulary of
the campus with clearly expressed concrete trays framing a skin that
appears to be almost wholly made up of wood shutters. To fit into the
campus, Weese sunk the large building two floors into the ground, creating
a light well of the garden in the rear. Leddy's challenge was to add room
for Stanford's innovative design program, which is a joint venture between
the art, engineering, and business schools.

The site defined the building. ``We soon realized that it was more about
the space between the two buildings than about the envelope,'' recalls
Leddy. This fit Neuman's philosophy, since he believes that the landscape
is almost as important as the buildings themselves. ``It's what our alumni
remember, it's what sets the character of the campus.'' Leddy placed the
building--two state-of-the-art ``case study'' classrooms outfitted ``almost
like broadcast studios'' and two loft-like design studios--in a rectangular
volume packed between an access road to the west and a grove of oak trees
to the east. To the south, the Thornton Center presents a simple, low
facade, ``setting the stage for the development of the campus across the
street,'' as Neuman puts it. The building rises up on the north side both
to catch light for the studios and to answer the scale of the Terman
Building. Working with landscape architect Peter Walker, Leddy then
reconfigured the sunken courtyard into an open, sloping outdoor room.

The Thornton Center's main feature is its central gateway. This is an
updated version of the rhythm of great arches that march through the
campus, and that had already found a more rectilinear expression in the
Terman Building. The portal is not just an expressive framing device: by
using it for external circulation, Leddy avoided the need for interior
corridors. The steel trusses that frame the stairs provide lateral seismic
bracing. ``This is what I think of as the strength of Tanner Leddy Maytum
Stacy's work,'' says Neuman. ``They give you an artistic expression of
structural elements that allow for a simplicity of use, and that makes the
building easy to understand at every level.'' Carried out in an ``updated
version of the Stanford vocabulary,'' as he puts it, the Thornton Center is
a steel, stucco, concrete, and copper emblem of the architectural craft,
and a clear representation of the reality of site, function, and the
aspirations of the client.

University, caps the composition, the visible portion of the Thornton
Center is stucco and copper. The ``piano nobile'' of the studios uses
copper to visually bridge the yellowish color of the stucco to the
building's graypainted exposed steel framing. Steel-cased windows frame the
structural grid, emphasizing the building's rhythm. Although the building
is a true shed-form, this is only apparent on the east and west
facades--otherwise it appears to have an extremely strong orthogonal
massing.

STANFORD'S NEW STYLE: UP CLOSE

Structural definition. The Thornton Center is essentially a rectangular box
whose interior spaces are defined by a row of steel trusses. The shape of
these members creates a sloped roof that echoes the Stanford vocabulary,
and is a form also typically used in industrial buildings to create
daylight monitors. Here the second-floor classrooms are opened up to the
north light. Lateral seismic bracing is provided at the slightly off-center
center portal, in the form of a Pratt truss. The end facades are frank
expressions of this structural and functional arrangement. The only
additions involve the site. These include screen walls, the portico--whose
poured-in-place columns echo the Terman Building--and the slightly
whimsical extension of the stair landing into a ``Pope's balcony.''

ON THE OUTSIDE
Clapboard and shingles clad many homes in America. Both plastic and
natural-wood products can offer excellent appearance and long-term
performance if properly selected and installed.

According to the Vinyl Siding Institute, a division of the Society of the
Plastics Industry, vinyl is now the most popular siding choice for
residential exteriors, including multifamily projects and condominiums. By
1993, PVC had 44 percent of this market, compared to 39 percent for wood,
14 percent for masonry, and 3 percent for ``other.'' Today's plastic with
UV inhibitors represents more sophisticated chemistry than earlier
pretty-much-just-white siding. Achieving UV stabilization has expanded the
palette to include deep tones and authentic historic colors; elements such
as door lintels and dentil moldings enable the designer to create a
detailed facade using vinyl accessories.

Correct installation is key
   Rigid PVC siding must conform to the dimensional and other
characteristics required by ASTM 3679; color change over the life of the
siding should be within this standard's color-hold guidelines.

The main concern of a vinyl-siding installation should be to fasten the
panels as described in Rigid Vinyl Siding--Application Instructions: nails
must be spaced correctly and centered in the slots; nailheads must not
embed and restrict the thermal movement of the panel, anticipated to be
about 1/4-in. over a 12-ft length. Siding must be able to expand and
contract or it will buckle. Siding distortion from improper nailing is the
most common complaint brought to the Institute, says Rich Gottwald,
technical director.

Over and above the dimensional and color-retention standards compelled by
ASTM D-3679, there is a wide number of surface grain pattern and gloss
options, panel profiles, and coordinating accessories for the architect to
choose from. We show five new product lines here.

Half-round shingles
   A new pattern in this maker's Cedar Impressions line, half-round
shingles are made in molds cast directly from hand-cut cedar pieces. While
made of polypropylene to better mimic the texture of the wood original, the
shingles come in seven colors designed to work with vinyl siding products
and trims. Shingles are furnished as a 34-in. double-course panel with
interlocking side tabs said to provide a seamless appear-ance when
installed; these and others of this maker's siding products have been
success-fully wind-tested at 180 mph. 800/233-8990. CertainTeed Corp.,
Siding Division, Vinyl Building Products Group, Valley Forge, Pa.

Long-lasting colors
   Heartland guarantees its Satin Ensemble vinyl siding to exhibit color
retention well above ASTM re-quirements. Available in nine colors ranging
from white and pastels to darker clay, sage, and gray tones, siding comes
in the four pro-files shown: double 4-in., double 5-in., double 4-in. Dutch
lap, and a triple 3-in. exposure. An architectural specification binder and
color fandecks sample siding, soffit, trim, and Sherwin-Williams paint
colors designed to work together. 800/328-7864. Heartland Building
Products, Booneville, Miss.

Realistic texture
   Waterford, a new siding produced by a recently acquired Canadian
subsidiary of ABT Building Products, incorporates a fairly subtle woodgrain
embossing. Siding comes in 10 colors with matching accessories, facings,
and shutters. Profiles include double 4- and 5-in. and a double-4-in.

Bigger product mix
   Expanding its range of product for the residential/multifamily market,

surface said to resemble painted wood. The product comes in eight colors
and three styles, including the double 4-inch lap shown. 800/GET-PINK.

Positive lock
   Wolverine's new siding, American Legend, has a 90-deg face, and
more-secure edge design that snaps panels together horizontally. This
increased stiffness helps keep siding straight during installation. The
vinyl's surface is described as a ``soft'' woodgrain, available in nine
colors; ``Cream'' is shown on the house. An Exterior Design System for
architects illustrates coordinating siding, trim, and accessories; an Idea
Book includes before- and-after photos to demonstrate how siding can be
``historically correct.'' 800/452-2152. Wolverine Technologies, Livonia,

SPECIFICATIONS REVISED FOR RED-CEDAR SIDINGS

Siding made of western red-cedar lumber is a premium architectural product.
Correctly selected, installed, and finished, there is no reason cedar
siding should not remain weatherproof and attractive for decades. And its
physical characteristics permit a range of versatile architectural
applications not possible with other materials. For example, architect Paul
Grant was able to apply bevel-edge cedar siding to garage doors, to tie
them into the house itself (top, right).

To make sure that cedar achieves its full potential, an industry group
(whose members are the major sources of red-cedar lumber in the U.S. and
Canada) has published new guidelines for architects, trying to take some of
the mystery out of using cedar as an exterior siding and to reflect current
thinking on appropriate wood grades, attachment methods, and finishing
options (bottom, right).

Specification. It's important to be able to evaluate different cedar
sidings accurately, to select the most appropriate and economical grade for
the esthetic desired: will the siding have a clear, natural finish,
weathering over time? Will it be painted or stained? The Association's
Specification Guide includes good color photos that provide a realistic
look at the different grades of cedar and demonstrate their relative
differences. Tables for each siding type--bevel, patterned tongue and
groove and lap siding, and vertically oriented board-and-batten--list the
infor-mation needed to insure that the wood specified matches the intended
end use. Criteria:

-- Pattern. For example, plain bevel, rabbeted bevel, or wavy edge bevel.
-- Nominal size. Thickness and Width.
-- Quantities. Coverage tables translate different exposures into a surface
measure for calculating linear feet needed.
-- Grade. For bevel siding, these would include Clear Vertical-Grain
Heartwood, A Clear, Rustic, B Clear, Select Knotty, and Quality Knotty.
-- Grading agency paragraph. The appropriate rule to reference each
siding.
-- Surface to be exposed. Designation of either smooth face or sawn should
anticipate the finish to be applied: paint on smooth, clear or opaque stain
on rough-sawn surfaces.
-- Moisture content. Kiln-dried or green.

Installation. The two most-common mistakes in putting up siding are not
nailing to a suffi-cient base--fasteners must penetrate into a solid-wood
stud--and using the wrong nail. Choose hot-dipped galvanized, aluminum, or
stainless-steel nails only; stainless-steel is the best choice, especially
if the siding is to be finished with transparent or semi-transparent stain.
Make sure that the nail length accounts for sheathing thickness.

Finishing. The Association strongly recom-mends back priming all siding,
and feels that the performance and appearance expectations architects have
of cedar are better met with a coating appropriate to the look desired,
whe-ther paint, semi- or opaque stain, or a clear or weathering finish.

Columbia.

CORRECTIONS

A sketch from the archives of The Architects Collaborative, identified as
the work of Walter Gropius [RECORD, September 1995, page 19], was actually
the work of John C. Harkness. Harkness and Gropius worked together as
partners-in-charge on the design of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science Building.

The credits for the Columbus Regional Hospital [RECORD, November 1995,
pages 100-103], should have included Walter P. Moore and Associates as

MAKING AFFORDABLE PROJECTS WORK
Tax credits, planning ingenuity, and sensitivity to the needs of residents
can create attractive places for low-income people.

By:
By H. Jane Lehman

Money matters, it goes without saying. But the notable lack of it within
the affordable housing realm drives nearly every step of the design
process. For architects working on affordable housing projects, the
challenge, in a nutshell, is: How do you create tight but livable spaces
for little money on problem-laden sites for diverse groups of residents?
The answer: Carefully, sensitively, and with respect for the particular
needs of the people who will be living there.

The faithfulness of the architectural profession to these principles falls
to either extreme, says Bill Witte, a partner with The Related Companies of
California, an Irvine-based development company that specializes in
low-income housing. Much of the public housing built in America during the
post-war era failed to provide safe, attractive, or appropriately scaled
places to live. While design was hardly the only cause of these problems,
the architects involved in these projects and the profession as a whole
earned a reputation for being removed from the concerns of the people they
were designing for.

Today, more architects recognize the need to listen to clients and end
users. ``Cost-efficiency is very important, particularly when there are
limits on rent,'' says Witte in explaining a key issue for the
organizations that build affordable housing. ``But so is sensitivity to the
needs of the people who will live there,'' he adds. ``Do architects get it?
Some do, some don't.''

Tax-credit tangle
   Clients ready to start affordable projects often fight long and hard for
funds with which to proceed. Some patch together state and local funds, but
most rely on the federal low-income housing tax credit. With the demise of
the federally funded low-income housing production programs some 15 years
ago, tax-credit financing (begun in 1986) is about the only thing that has
sustained this market. The National Association of Home Builders estimates
that in recent years the credit has enabled the annual construction of
30,000 to 80,000 new low-income rental units and the rehabilitation of
about 60,000 existing affordable apartments (graph below shows new
construction using the credit).

The program works this way: Each state, based on a per capita formula, gets
a piece of an approximately $2.2-billion annual pie. Apartment developers
submit proposals, including pre-schematics and site pro-formas, in an
effort to win a credit allocation from a state housing finance agency.
Apartment rents must be affordable to households earning no more than 60
percent of the area's median income. In this case, affordable means a
family spends no more than a third of its household budget to cover the
rent. In the Los Angeles area, that translates to around $6,000 to $9,000 a
year for shelter, reports Witte, whose company has 10 tax-credit projects
underway in California.

Developers who succeed in procuring credits from the state then sell them,
often in conjunction with a syndicator, to investors who pay a lump sum for
the credits. The credits are used by investors for dollar-for-dollar
write-offs against tax liabilities. With the investors' cash as an equity
stake, developers do not need to borrow as much money to finance the
projects, thereby lowering the rents they need to charge.

Credits' fate is in doubt--again
   Although the system is working well, there is a fly in the ointment. The
program's permanent status is in doubt--again. Two years ago,
Congress--then controlled by the Democrats--voted to end the uncertainty
associated with year-by-year renewal of the credit by embedding it
permanently in the tax code. This fall, the Republican-led Congress agreed
to revoke the tax credit's permanent status as of December 31, 1997. If
that happens, the program's supporters say, the tax credit will not fare
well at a time when federal spending is shrinking. ``Sunsetting the tax
credit is tantamount to killing it,'' states John McEvoy, executive
director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies. The program's
best hope is a Presidential veto with instructions to Congress to return
with a new budget reconciliation bill that, among other things, preserves
the credit's permanent status, explains Andre Shashaty, the publisher of a
San Francisco-based magazine devoted to affordable housing finance. That,
he says, would insulate it from the knock-down, drag-out federal budget
fights expected in the coming years.

In terms of design, taking a one-size-fits-all approach to affordable
housing is destined to fail, given the diversity of the intended occupants.
Residents may be single mothers, two parents with lots of kids,
inter-generational households, senior citizens, the disabled, or new
immigrants. This may mean including in the program special support
features, such as open space, playgrounds, athletic fields, child-care
operations, job-training facilities, stores, or social-services offices. Or
it may mean recognizing that the needs of any one group may be foreign to
the architect's own experience, says Michael Pyatok, head of Oakland-based
Pyatok Associates, which designs about 400 units of low-income housing a
year on the West Coast.

Involving users in the design process
   ``With over 20 applicants for every affordable apartment, architects can
design just about anything and because the rent is cheap and the building
is new, it will be rented,'' states Pyatok. ``Consequently, architects have
felt free to design for their peers and their ideology, but invariably we
have torn those things down.'' Pyatok addresses the problem by including in
the design process the neighborhood from which the tenants are likely to
come. Recently, the architects met every two weeks with community members
living near the site proposed for a project in San Jose. At the sessions,
five groups of 10 Latinos worked with modeling kits to explore apartment
and site possibilities. After showing seven historical design directions,
as well as their contemporary interpretations, Pyatok was surprised when
all of the groups, working independently, not only settled on the same
category but picked the same two images out of the four offered. The
winner? ``They loved the vibrancy of the Crafts style.''

A different tack was taken by Solomon Architecture & Urban Design in
shaping the Vest Pocket Community in Fairfax, California, a project with 19
units of rental housing shared by roommates and designed to look like
single-family houses. The non-profit developer, Innovative Housing of San
Rafael, matches up roommates, deliberately bringing together the disabled,
seniors, and single mothers. Besides the usual challenges of affordable
housing design, privacy was an especially important issue here because
non-related people would be living together, says architect Daniel
Solomon.

By definition, low-income housing is smaller and denser than market-rate
developments. The trick is to accomplish the economic trade-offs while
avoiding the ``danger of making these places unworkable,'' explains Avi
Friedman, director of the Affordable Housing Program at the school of
architecture at McGill University in Montreal. The program doesn't just
examine issues of affordable housing, it actually develops new prototypes
as well. The 14-foot-wide and 36-foot-deep GrowHomes it pioneered cost
$60,000.

Part of the secret to designing affordable housing is creating efficient
floor plans. ``I have just gotten good at putting units together so there
is no wasted space,'' says Solomon. Other critical ingredients are good
access to daylight and views, says Joan Goody of Goody Clancy & Associates
in Boston, a 50-person firm that has designed such award-winning housing
projects as the 1988 Tent City and Langham Court [RECORD, July 1992, pages
92-97]. Goody is adept at carving four bedrooms out of the same space
devoted to two in market-rate projects.

Nonetheless, architects should no more skimp on design details of housing
for poor people than they should when designing for more affluent people.
``Affordable housing does not cost any less to build,'' asserts Goody,
``and it is a myth to think that it can.'' Many of Goody's projects,
including Langham Court, mix low-, moderate-, and upper-income residents
together without making quality distinctions among the units. ``It is not
normal for people to live segregated by income.'' A well-built project that
fits into its surrounding neighborhood can help counter the knee-jerk
response by many groups to resist the placement of affordable housing in
their communities. Such a project ``becomes a billboard for the next
project you may want to do,'' says Pyatok. ``It dispels doubts that other
communities might have.''

Responding to site and context
   Low-income housing suffers from a poor reputation generally, driven
largely by deeply flawed site designs from the past, which set the stage
for crime and vandalism, says Solomon. The wholesale leveling of existing
neighborhoods in the 1950s and 1960s in the name of urban renewal
``destroyed the town fabric and stigmatized the poor,'' says Solomon.

Lost in the razing, explains Pyatok, was the old urban morphology of the
American town that included rowhouses with front porches and backyards, the
celebration of corner homes, the street grid, residential alleys,
courtyards, and storefronts. Bringing that all back, he says, will let
``people get to know each other again.''

HOMAN SQUARE
Chicago
Nagle Hartray Danker Kagan McKay Architects/Planners

By:
Clifford A. Pearson

Located on the former site of Sears Roebuck & Co.'s world headquarters in
west Chicago, Homan Square is an ambitious development that aims to revive
a decaying neighborhood. Until the early 1970s when Sears moved to its
world's-tallest tower in downtown Chicago, the 55-acre site was the heart
of its global operations and included a 4-million-sq-ft warehouse, office
buildings, and giant parking lots. Sears' move downtown, combined with
racial unrest in 1968, triggered a downward spiral of decay and
disinvestment that left the North Lawndale area an urban basket case. Now
Homan Square is reversing that trend, bringing new subsidized and
market-rate housing, and some commercial development, back to the
neighborhood. A joint-venture of Sears and The Shaw Company, a respected
local developer, Homan Square will eventually encompass 600 new units of
rental and for-sale housing, as well as the redevelopment of existing
office space for private businesses and the possible conversion of a 1905
brick tower into a community center. Thanks to Sears' donation of the land
and its $13,000 subsidy for each for-sale unit in the first two phases, the
project is providing housing for low-income families. Additional subsidies
of $20,000 per unit from the city's New Homes for Chicago program and
housing tax credits are keeping most of the units here within the reach of
families earning less than 80 percent of the local median income. As
masterplanned by Nagle Hartray Danker Kagan McKay Architect/Planners, Homan
Square is a series of mixed-income blocks that fit into the city's existing
street grid while varying enough from the usual formula to establish its
own identity. ``The idea was to develop a site plan that would work with
the scale of the existing neighborhood, while creating defensible open
spaces in each block,'' says partner-in-charge Dirk Danker. Instead of
lining up all the housing along the street, as is typical in Chicago, the
architects carved out small green spaces at the four corners and two larger
open spaces in the middle of each block. To make sure these open spaces are
safe places for residents, the masterplan organizes housing units so they
face the outdoor spaces. By lining the open areas with front doors, the
plan makes sure the residents take possession of the communal spaces.
Although most homes are serviced from the back by alleys, the amount of
space devoted to these internal roads is kept to a minimum and backyards
are fenced off so that each family controls this space. Homan Square
includes three types of housing--detached single-family homes, townhouses,
and apartments--and each block includes all three. By integrating all three
in each block, the developers made sure there would be a mix of income
groups and family types in each phase of the project. ``We wanted to mix it
up as much as possible,'' says Danker. Three-story apartment buildings with
six units each anchor the four corners of the block, while 24 single-family
homes wrap around the two lawns in the middle of the block. In between are
four rows of townhouses, five units to a row. The result is 68 units to the
block. The three-bedroom single-family houses range in size from 1,590 to
1,670 square feet and in price from $92,000 to $97,000. In the project's
first phase (one block), which was completed and fully occupied in the
second half of 1995, rents ranged from $385 a month for 850-sq-ft
apartments to $490 for 1,160-sq-ft townhouses. Some of the units have
half-sunken basements and all are simple wood-frame structures with wood
trusses and clad with brick at the base and stucco and EIFS above. By using
masonry only at the base, stacking plumbing, and using efficient floor
plans that almost eliminate corridors, the architects were able to keep
construction costs down to about $70 a square foot. Corner windows and open
living spaces make these units feel larger than they are. A second block is
under construction and will be ready this spring. Phase 2 is already sold
out. A third phase with 16 market-rate homes is being designed by Schroeder
Murchie Laya Associates. ``Our hope is to establish a neighborhood that's
good, a place where people want to live,'' says design principal James
Nagle. The plan seems to be working. In fact, the project is encouraging
residents of adjacent blocks to upgrade their homes.

Apartments are all 850-sq-ft flats that share the same plan (this page).
Because the three-story apartment buildings have just two units per floor,
each apartment gets three exposures and cross ventilation. Townhouses

basements that can be finished by residents later on. The living space of
the townhouses is kept open to make the unit feel bigger. Single-family

SRO RESIDENCE
Brooklyn, New York
Architrope, Architect

By:
C.A.P.

When the New York State Office of Mental Health started a new program of
``service-enriched'' single-room-occupancy (SRO) housing in 1992, architect
Jonathan Kirschenfeld convinced the agency that new construction would be
more practical than renovating old buildings. Because the program called
for buildings with 44 efficiency apartments, four married-couples
apartments, and such ``enriched'' services as counseling,
medication-management, and shared dining, Kirschenfeld argued it would be
difficult to fit all that into an existing building shell. With each
240-sq-ft apartment having its own full bathroom and kitchenette, the
plumbing requirements alone would have made converting an old structure a
nightmare, says the architect. Flexibility was also a priority, since the
buildings would house special populations ranging from the mentally ill to
drug abusers. Three years later, the state agency was eliminated by a new
Republican governor, but a prototype SRO, designed by Kirschenfeld's firm
Archi-trope and run by a non-profit organization called Services for the
Underserviced, opened in Brooklyn. The five-story, 24,200-sq-ft building
was finished on time for $2.83 million ($117 a square foot). Using a simple
bearing-block-and-concrete-plank structure and an efficient double-loaded
corridor plan for the apartment floors, the architect was able to lavish
attention on a few important features--such as a finely detailed brick
facade with 8-inch reveals around all openings. The result is a building
that projects a sense of depth and solidity. Inside, the first floor is
devoted to public spaces that benefit greatly from 11-foot ceilings, wood
wainscoting, and furniture designed by the architect. By providing an
attractive lounge and dining room overlooking a rear yard, the building
encourages residents to practice their social skills, while allowing them
to retreat to their own rooms. In the apartments, 8-foot-6-inch ceilings
give some lift to the small units.

LOS ESTEROS APARTMENTS
San Jose, California
Fisher-Friedman Associates, Architect

By:
C.A.P.

Built by a local non-profit organization, First San Jose Housing, Los
Esteros Apartments brings the best ideas of market-rate development to the
affordable end of the housing spectrum. In fact, according to Rodney
Friedman, the partner-in-charge of design, the eight apartment buildings
here are better built and have better finishes than most market-rate
projects. How is this possible? By eliminating a private developer's
overhead and profit margin, by getting the city of San Jose to supply some
of the up-front equity to reduce the construction mortgage, and by using
low-income housing tax credits, First San Jose Housing was able to apply
more money to the buildings themselves. ``It was great working with First
San Jose,'' says Friedman. ``Their only goal was to build the best project,
not to make money.'' Designed to create a sense of community, the project
includes a 3,000-square-foot clubhouse with swimming pool, a playground for
tots, and communal green areas. In addition, some of the apartment
buildings have front stoops for socializing and all look onto a central
allee landscaped with palm trees. All of the residential buildings are
four-story wood-frame structures. Five are built on concrete slabs, while
three are built over a single level of half-sunken parking. Occupying a
7.7-acre site in a suburban part of a redevelopment district, the project
includes 246 apartments: 12 one-bedroom units of 600 square feet, 150
two-bedroom units of about 850 square feet, and 84 three-bedroom units
ranging from 1,104 to 1,400 square feet. In addition to the communal
outdoor areas, the project provides a private outdoor space for every
apartment--either a patio or a terrace. Top-floor apartments have
extra-height living rooms, some with 14-foot ceilings. To break down the
scale of each building and give it the look of a series of smaller attached
structures, the architects used a variety of exterior materials (horizontal
wood siding, cedar shingles, painted wood railings) and colors.

WASHINGTON MONUMENTS: BATTLES OVER THE MALL
A frenzy of monument building is sweeping through the nation's capital.
Roger Lewis takes stock of the latest additions and what's to come.

By:
By Roger K. Lewis

Last July, on a hot, humid day in Washington, D.C., the Korean War Veterans
Memorial was dedicated. Over six years had elapsed since the spring 1989
national design competition was won by a team of architects and landscape
architects based at Pennsylvania State University.

That team proposed building a metaphoric landscape of expansive triangular
plazas, groves of plane trees with canopies pruned into distorted shapes,
and a flag. Perhaps most important to the memorial imagery of this strongly
geometrical landscape, occupying the southwest corner of the Mall opposite
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, would be a column of 38 American soldiers
frozen in a moment of convergence on their single destination, the flag. It
was a memorial design intended to be at once representational and symbolic,
a commentary on both the costly horror of war and the honor of combatants
who, when called, serve their nation dutifully and unselfishly to wage
war.

After receiving their prize money, the winning designers--Burns Lucas, Len,
Lucas, Pennypacker Oberholtzer (referred to as BL3PO, then BL3 when
Pennypacker Oberholtzer dropped out)--were paired up as ``design
consultants'' with Cooper-Lecky Architects, the Washington firm designated
as architect-of-record. Cooper-Lecky, having worked previously with Maya
Lin in executing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, had the technical expertise
and procedural experience needed to carry out the project.

But conflicts soon arose between the two design groups as substantial
changes were suggested by the Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board,
numerous federal agencies with jurisdiction over the site, and
Cooper-Lecky. The changes sought to reduce the size and cost of the
memorial, simplify its overall composition, and improve circulation around
and through it. BL3 resisted many of the proposed modifications, claiming
that the integrity of their original design was being violated, that their
concept was being unreasonably compromised and watered down. Further, they
felt themselves being increasingly excluded from the design process.

The impasse led to BL3's complete withdrawal and subsequently to litigation
in federal court, which proved ultimately unsuccessful since the terms of
the competition guaranteed neither the faithful implementation of the
winning design nor the winners' participation in the post-competition
design process. Having become the sole architect, Cooper-Lecky then spent
three years working through multiple design variations. After many meetings
and trips back to the drawing board, they finally obtained approval of what
has now been built and dedicated.

Remnants of the competition-winning design can be found in the final
ensemble created by Cooper-Lecky, sculptor Frank C. Gaylord II, and
muralist Louis Nelson: the soldiers, reduced in number from 38 to 19, are
still marching toward a common objective, the flag; the ``field of
service'' occupied by the soldiers is triangular, reminiscent of the
competition-winning scheme's geometry; a grove of trees--lindens, not plane
trees--is an integral part of the ensemble, although its formal disposition
is different. Not derived from the competition-winning design is a
164-foot-long wall of polished black granite--can anyone doubt its source
of inspiration?--etched with the faces of support troops and terminating in
an elevated circular pool at the eastern vertex of the triangular field.

Metal soldiers in a Platonic landscape
   As shaped by Cooper-Lecky, the premiated design evolved into a memorial
smaller in size and more accessible to visitors both physically and
symbolically. Like the original BL3 design, the immaculately detailed
memorial's most arresting architectural quality results from compositional
tension: the larger-than-life, gun-metal-gray soldiers in motion, molded
softly and imprecisely of stainless steel, looking anxious, weary,
determined; and a highly abstracted, almost Platonic landscape crafted of
hard-edged, machined slabs of granite--long rectangular wall, linear
plinths, a circular pool, furrows in the triangular field defined by
parallel strips of polished stone separating rows of juniper.

The Korean War Veterans Memorial has been enthusiastically welcomed and
generally praised by the public, both for its design and its craftsmanship.
But this writer cannot look at it without thinking that something went
awry, that both the design process and final product were flawed.

Cleansing a project's design history
   As I walked around the memorial, its debt to its precursor was
unmistakable. I kept recalling the BL3 scheme, as if I were looking not at
an original work of design, but rather at a radically remodeled version of
a work by someone else, a work beaten into acceptable shape by its
architect and by the several official bodies with absolute dominion over
this landscape--the Korean War Memorial Advisory Board, the American Battle
Monuments Commission, the National Capital Memorial Commission, the
National Park Service, and the Commission of Fine Arts.

And how thoroughly the memorial's design history had been cleansed, there
being little official mention of the design competition, the conceptual
starting point for the design, and little credit given to BL3 for its
contribution of the germinal ideas.

Few who see the memorial will care that its creation was plagued by years
of controversy and compromise. Visitors will like its relatively small
scale and its unambiguous figurative and representational messages. They
will not pose questions: Why so many soldiers? (Nineteen is half of 38, a
dubiously meaningful reference to the parallel dividing North and South
Korea.) Why the number of disparate elements? Why the wall lamely echoing
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial? Why, next to the flag toward which the
soldiers are struggling, a round pool into which the end of the etched wall
plunges? Why isn't the flag plaza less encumbered, surrounded instead by
open space no less capable of evoking contemplation than a pool of water?

To put the Korean War Veterans Memorial in perspective, let's consider the
painful evolution of another project--the FDR Memorial. Four decades after
Congress set up the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission,
construction finally began in 1994 in West Potomac Park, near the Tidal
Basin.
A detailed chronology of this design saga requires several pages, but
highlights include: a 1960 design competition won by Pedersen & Tilney;
years of design revisions with several cycles of approval and rejection
between 1961 and 1965; selection of Marcel Breuer to develop a new design,
accepted by the FDR Memorial Commission but rejected in 1967 by the
Commission of Fine Arts; dormancy during the Vietnam War; selection in 1974
of landscape architect Lawrence Halprin to design the memorial as part of a
27-acre park, with the design--including sculptures--developed and approved
between 1975 and 1978; design modified to significantly reduce costs,
approved in 1979; in 1981, resolutions introduced in Congress authorizing
construction of the memorial; further design by Halprin to obtain detailed
cost estimates in 1984, after which the project again lay dormant until
1988, when Rep. Claude Pepper, the new Memorial Commission chairman,
reactivated the project; still more design changes approved in 1990; at
last, a 1991 groundbreaking ceremony, followed by a $10-million capital
campaign to augment the $42 million in funds provided by Congress, with
construction finally starting in 1994.

A monument to overdesign
   The ultimate FDR Memorial irony is that Roosevelt himself asked that no
such memorial be built, a reflection of his discomfort with idolization and
his concerns that grandiose memorials can exaggerate, obscure, or
oversimplify history. Unfortunately, his wishes were ignored, and his
reasoning may be vindicated. The FDR Memorial, costing over $50 million, is
a monument to overdesign, a landscape predicated on the notion that bigger
must be better.

The memorial expropriates far too much public land--nearly eight acres of
West Potomac Park. Entailing an 800-ft-long procession through four outdoor
garden rooms, it is replete with landscaping and meandering rectilinear
walls, numerous water features, sculptures by a half dozen artists, and
extensive narrative inscriptions and quotations. It's not that a garden
couldn't be an appropriate memorial, nor that pieces of Halprin's design
aren't attractive. But the size of this sprawling, historically didactic
ensemble is excessive, notwithstanding the significance of FDR's presidency
encompassing the Depression and World War II.

Commemorating this president and those dozen years could be accomplished
more forcefully and succinctly, in keeping with FDR's wishes, were the
memorial's physical form and energy more concentrated in the Mall
landscape.

Further, looking into the future with a perspective that spans centuries
instead of decades of history, and considering the finiteness of the Mall,
it seems questionable to dedicate so much of that precious landscape to one
individual and only 12 years of 20th-century history. How and where will we
commemorate the important individuals and events of the 21st, 24th, or 30th
century?

More memorials are already in the pipeline, among them the Women in
Military Service to America Memorial, for which ground has been broken, an
Air Force memorial, a World War II memorial, and a memorial to Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. Countless others have been proposed, abandoned, or built
elsewhere. Can anyone doubt that countless more will be proposed in the
future?

Bureaucracy and democracy in action
   Why has creating a memorial in Washington become so arduous and
contentious? And how can designers preserve the integrity of their original
designs, given so complex a process?

Building memorials in Washington is, in fact, symptomatic of what happens
today in state, county, and municipal jurisdictions throughout the United
States. As architects know all too well, constructing anything in the
public domain, be it a memorial or a library or a bus depot, involves more
``cooks in the kitchen'' than ever before--more governmental and citizen
review agencies, more public hearings, more permits, and more contradictory
opinions about design. Consequently, the implementation process has become
more time-consuming, more expensive, and more likely to yield unfortunate
design compromises. This is bureaucracy and democracy in action, the result
of a process involving a diverse citizenry armed with diverse points of
view. How much easier was the architect's monument-building task in
previous centuries when only a single patron had to be courted and
satisfied.

Further worsening matters, political correctness can enter the design
process, often conflicting directly with esthetic aspirations. Memorial
commissioners and other review officials are especially sensitive about
memorial constituents--such as veterans and their families--and how the
public in general might interpret a memorial's design.

Both explicit and implicit symbolism in commemorative structures embue them
with great meaning. Yet since people readily ``deconstruct'' and find
unintended symbolism in works of art, a design with potentially
controversial overtones inevitably is challenged. Maya Lin's Vietnam
Veterans Memorial--its black-granite walls descending below grade and, to
some, suggesting condemnation rather than commemoration--epitomizes a
structure inviting negative interpretations. Amazingly, Lin's design
changed little from design-competition concept to realization--a tribute to
her remarkable tenacity.

Design competitions are a favorite and seemingly appropriate strategy for
designing memorials, but they pose problems. Improperly managed, or without
a well-written program and insightful jury, they rarely succeed. And timing
is always problematic. Memorial sponsors want a design concept early on to
catalyze fund raising. But because construction cannot begin without funds
and design approvals in place, years can elapse between the conclusion of a
design competition and the beginning of construction. As the FDR Memorial
illustrates, much can happen during this interval to affect the design:
costs rise, esthetic values shift, public perceptions change. A trendy,
winning design may have a short shelf life. What was embraced one year
might be rejected a few years later.

Jockeying for position on the Mall
   One final question is worth asking. Why has memorial fever seemed to
intensify during the closing decades of the 20th century? [See RECORD,
October 1995, page 9.] This is a question that clearly preoccupied members
of Congress in 1986 when they adopted stricter memorial building criteria.
There seems to be rising group consciousness among Americans about their
group's special history, their unique experiences and struggles both in war
and peace. Moreover, the number of distinct ``groups'' lobbying for
memorial sites is likewise rising. Perhaps it's the approach of a new
millenium. Yet this is not really a new phenomenon--memorial building
frenzies have followed all major wars, going back to the American
Revolution.

America's capital with its extraordinary public landscape will always be
the preferred setting for national memorials. But because the Mall is
limited in size and, in its present form, less than 100 years old, one can
visualize it becoming cluttered with memorials during the next century.
What then would remain for the centuries to follow?

Americans must identify and embrace sites in other locales for
commemorative structures. Otherwise, an excess of memorials built on or
around the Mall will detract from and devalue those that are most sacred,
the few that truly deserve to occupy the pantheon.

TSCHUMI ABSTRACTS MCKIM, MEAD, & WHITE'S PLAN FOR COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

By:
Nicolai Ouroussoff

(New York CIty)
Bernard Tschumi, who as an architect is best known for his Parc de la
Villette follies in Paris, has resurrected a circa 1870s McKim, Mead, &
White campus plan for Columbia University in his design of the school's new
student center. Tschumi, dean of the University's graduate school of
architecture, has teamed up with Gruzen Samton to produce Lerner Hall,
which adheres to the original plan with three distinct volumes. Scheduled
to open in 1999, it will contain an auditorium, movie theater, radio
station, and student clubs and mailboxes.

A BIRD-LIKE STRUCTURE RISES FROM THE RUINS

By:
N.O.

(New York City)
Santiago Calatrava's design for a restaurant pavilion on the southern tip
of Roosevelt Island is the latest tentative step in the rehabilitation of
Southpoint: the old island asylum, called the Octagon, has been stabilized
and plans are afoot to build Louis Kahn's proposed memorial park.
Calatrava's design takes the form of a glass and steel cocoon. A moving
``brise soleil'' roof encloses the structure at night like two giant wings
and playfully manipulates light and shadow. A stone base is made up of
ruins from a hospital previously on the site.

STANDARD DATA GETS DATA STANDARDS
To realize the full promise of computers in architectural practice, a wide
range of manufacturer and price information is finally being computerized
in a standard way.

By:
By Steven S. Ross

As we've been saying for some time, the full promise of computers in
architectural practice can only be fulfilled if a wide range of
manufacturer and price information is computerized in a standard format.
Once that happens, data can be more easily exchanged among various sectors
of the construction industry.

The two biggest questions about that computerization--who will handle the
job of computerization, and how will it be standardized--were answered in
part over the past two months.

Autodesk, the people who bring you Auto-CAD, have been near the center of
all of developing the standards. With the help of several major information
providers--including the Sweet's Group at the McGraw-Hill
Companies--Autodesk will be publishing a ``Design and Construction
Library'' of ``intelligent'' digital data.

Sweet's has been putting vendor material on CD-ROM for some time. In fact,
it announced a service to prepare such material for vendors this past June.
Autodesk's Data Publishing group started its Mechanical Library last March.
That effort was, in many ways, the first example of intelligent digital
content for design professionals.

But the architectural world poses far more problems than mechanical
engineering--more products by smaller vendors, combined in more ways and
under more varied conditions. Thus, Autodesk is cooperating with a range of
data publishers that have construction-industry experience.

Sweet's is producing a CD-ROM series for Autodesk's Data Publishing Group
that will contain data on building products and equipment, in
pre-formatted, dimensioned CAD files. Sweet's research shows that about a
third of all drafting time is spent re-drawing building components and
products that have already been selected and specified.

Sweet's has long required that manufacturers put their materials into a
standard print format for inclusion in its catalogs. But doing the same for
computer formats requires even more cooperation from vendors. The vendors
certainly can distribute independently of Sweet's, and many do. But if they
don't comply with the Sweet's standards for their details, they may be shut
out of many designers' decisions.

R.S. Means, a subsidiary of Southam Construction Information Network, will
produce CD-ROMs that link to AutoCAD, providing what could become the
standard way to link objects (doors, windows, wall materials, and so forth)
in a drawing with cost data. Again, the potential for increased accuracy
and decreased time spent is high. James D'Arezzo, vice president of
Autodesk's Data Management Group, estimates, ``AEC professionals spend as
much as 25 percent of each day documenting design decisions and change
orders.'' Being able to update costs--if not all costs--instantaneously as
changes are contemplated modifies the way design professionals approach the
whole process.

Another Southam affiliate, MSA (Manufacturers' Survey Associates, Inc.) is
also joining up to produce hvac, plumbing, and electrical-design data for
CD-ROM. So is a more traditional publisher, John Wiley & Sons.

Thus, makers of building products and traditional data publishers, rather
than software companies, will put all of this in computer form. But the
traditional publishers and the product vendors must cooperate with software
companies. Otherwise, everything won't work together.

But will it all work together anyway? And what information should sellers
of building products include in their computer files? That has also been
answered, in large part by the industry push to standardize computer
``objects.''

The Industry Alliance for Interoperability is trying to standardize what
information, exactly, a standard object will contain at a minimum--the
so-called ``industry foundation classes'' for such objects as doors and
windows. Such information could include materials, colors, weight, and fire
ratings as well as dimensions [RECORD, August 1995, pages 32-34].
Autodesk's largest competitor, MicroStation's Bentley, joined the alliance
last October. IAI was originally championed by Autodesk, but is now an
independent organization.

With Bentley joining the alliance, it will ultimately mean that ``objects''
could work with both major families of CAD software--AutoCAD and
MicroStation. We say ``could'' because many vendors of add-on software have
yet to sign on. Many have, and Bentley's action, along with various data
publishers' willingness to bring product manufacturers along, should
accelerate the trend. It should also bring many other CAD vendors into the
fold.

All this won't happen overnight, of course. In fact, release of the first
batch of ``foundation classes'' was supposed to take place last fall. It is
imminent as we go to press. And, although publishers' automated
``intelligent'' catalogs are released this year, it will be some time
before they will be fully compliant with object classes (there won't even
be standards for many products this year) and before CAD software will
fully interact with the objects.

But the road ahead now looks rather clear--and wide.

CHEAP TOOLS
Here are three graphics packages that won't break the bank, but may make
your office more efficient--and your life easier as well.

Visio Technical 4.0

Vendor: Visio Corporation, 520 Pike St., Suite 1800, Seattle, WA 98101,
206/521-4500, fax 206/521-4501, CompuServe GO VISIO, Microsoft Network
Visio Forum, http://www.visio.com.

Equipment required: Computer capable of running Windows 3.1, Windows NT
3.51 or higher, or Windows 95. Full installation takes 30 MB of disk
space.

Cost:$249 (street price closer to $150).

Imagine ``drawing'' by dragging pre-defined shapes onto the page and
connecting them. That's what Visio is all about. When it first appeared in
1992, Visio was aimed more at simple but annoying jobs such as drawing
organization charts. With Technical Version 4.0, it becomes a full-featured
tool, particularly useful for facilities management, landscaping, HVAC, and
other tasks that require repetitive drafting work.

Each shape (Visio 4.0 comes with about 2,000 of them) has data behind
it--data that governs its behavior. You can create an unlimited number of
new shapes as well, either from scratch, by modifying old shapes, or by
importing drawings or symbols into Visio. AutoCAD symbol libraries can
become libraries of Visio shapes.

The data is in what Visio calls a Shape Sheet--there's one for each shape.
It can contain formulas to govern the behavior of shapes as you scale them.
Thus, you can set up a desk to stretch without getting wider, or a table to
get larger without enlarging the associated chairs.

As you might expect, there's full import and export of AutoCAD DXF and DWG
(binary) files, as well as IGES and Illustrator. There's import of
CorelDraw, Micrografx DRW, and many standard formats such as TIF and PCX.
But Visio throws in some tricks as well. You can, for instance, assign the
same object to more than one layer in Visio. You can also use a Visio
drawing on top of an AutoCAD drawing--for redlining or perhaps to add
furniture to an office plan.

By the way, Visio used to call itself Shapeware--same company, new name.

Manuals: On-line for using Visio itself. Printed 420-page manual for
developing your own solutions--by creating new shapes and so forth.
Ease of use: Trivial to draw with; creating something as sophisticated as a
facilities--management layout requires lots of work. Wide choice of
interfaces--you can make it look like Microsoft Office, Novell
PerfectOffice, or Lotus SmartSuite.

Error-trapping: Excellent.

XCAD 3.0

Vendor: Xitron Software Corporation, 1500 Chiquita Center, 250 East Fifth
St., Cincinnati, OH 45202. 513/762-7638, fax 513/662-3440, 800/817-8172.

Equipment required: Computer capable of running Windows NT or Windows
3.1/3.11. A fully tested 32-bit Windows 95 version should be available by
the time this review appears. Pentium processor strongly recommended.

Price:$495; street price about $420.

Looking for an easy-to-use 3D CAD program with good AutoCAD compatibility?
XCAD may be for you. Its major weakness as a 3D sketch tool is that it
lacks boolean capability--you can't use one shape to add to or hollow out
another. There's no binary (DWG) import or export in the version we
reviewed, but DWG, DXG, and IGES exchange is in the 32-bit version. Many of
our users found it a delight to draw with anyway, on fast computers.

You get continuous shading with multiple light sources (LightWorks was
added this fall), up to eight viewports (windows) on screen at once, and a
command emulator that makes it similar to AutoCAD, MicroStation, or Generic
CADD.

XCAD is also being marketed as the drawing engine in others' specialized
disk packages. It supports referenced drawings and has good
surface-modeling tools (most of the NURBS set). There's a macro-language
and a development kit available that can be used to add functionality to
XCAD.

Manuals: Separate paperbacks for getting started, tutorial, and a detailed
user guide/command reference.

Ease of use: Excellent 3D interface; slow on an older non-Pentium machine.
Error-trapping: Unlimited undo function. You can password-protect a drawing
on top of any network administrative scheme; if you lose the password,
there's no ''back door'' to get back your work.

Planix 3D Exterior Designer 1.0

Equipment required: Any computer that can run any version of Windows 3.1 or
higher. Must have separate math coprocessor if CPU is 386 or 486SX. Display
capable of at least 256 colors strongly recommended.

Vendor: Softdesk Retail Products, 10725 Ambassador Drive, Kansas City, MO
64153.

Price: Street price roughly $50.

Here's a great (and cheap) tool for ``brick and stick'' designers to lay
out a home, landscape it, and play around with its exterior finish.
Actually, it's meant for amateurs--non-architects--but you don't have to
tell anyone.

The interface is ingenious. For instance, you lay out your building in plan
by adjusting an existing footprint (there are many to choose from) by
pulling on its ``handles.'' Each story, and the roof, can have a different
footprint to allow overhangs and setbacks.

As you work on each item--plan, elevation, landscaping, roof--placing trim
and windows or doors and so forth, Planix automatically groups things into
layers for you. The package comes with plenty of symbols--trees and
windows, for instance--and allows you to create or add more. When you want
to visualize the results, click on ``render'' to get an image.

The underlying software engine is Drafix, one of the first and best
Windows-based CAD packages. (Softdesk's retail division was Foresight,
Drafix's developer.) But you can't directly save into an AutoCAD- or
MicroStation-compatible file format. Files can be saved as bitmaps, or for
Planix Home 3D (it does the interiors). That's the only real drawback.

Manuals: Straightforward 55-page reference and tutorial.

Ease of use: Trivial. Fun. You won't break the training budget on this
one.

Error-trapping: You can place the wrong thing in the wrong place, but
fixing it is a snap. You can also place a misleading filename extension on
a filename.


Illustration(s):
Illustration: Two Screens: Visio Technical 4.0: Note the kidney-shaped
swimming pool and the underlying ``shapesheet.'' Changing the sheet changes
the image and vice-versa. On-line help is context-sensitive and well
written. You can vary the placement of the windows on the screen as well.
The icons in this case are in the same style as Microsoft Office.

Illustration: Screen: XCAD 3.0: There's a full range of 3D as well as 2D
drawing, dimensioning, and shading tools. You can use the ``Cartesian''
window to change the viewpoint or to bring a 2D plane into the same
orientation as the screen for easy editing.

Illustration: Screen: Planix 3D Exterior: Designer 1.0 Wireframe and
rendered version of house.

WEAKENING CONSTRUCTION IN LATE 1995

Improvement in multi-family housing was not enough to offset overall
construction-volume declines in recent months. Retail and warehouse sectors
have slackened, reflecting slower sales, but offices--a recent source of
growth--also slipped 10 percent last month. Declining contracting for
schools, hospitals, and detention facilities caused the institutional
sector to fall back 14 percent. In 1996, an interest-rate cut might boost
single-family volume. Federal budget decisions will most affect volatile
non-building construction.

NEEDED: LOWER RISKS, MORE R&D

A survey of construction-industry professionals from more than 20 countries
revealed a number of trends that bar innovation in construction. Recurring
items are risk/liability and R&D-related concerns, including problems with
technology transfer. The pressures of project construction time were seen
as important. Leadership was flagged in the management area. Respondents
were particularly concerned about project delivery.

Building codes and standards were thought impediments to improving
materials and systems and design technology. Respondents were also asked
about public-policy barriers. They cited environmental regulations, lack of
leadership, and adversarial relationships as chief barriers. Trends
respondents thought important, though not necessarily barriers, include
computers, globalization, and environmental consciousness. Findings form
the basis for a symposium, ``Engineering and Construction for Sustainable
Development in the 21st Century,'' Washington, D.C., February 4-8.

CAN ARCHITECTURE AND POLITICS MIX?
As government building programs shrink, it's worth considering how
architects can better use the political process--and what the process says
about architects and their place in the community.

By:
James S. Russell

It's an election year. While these four words rightly evoke groans from
those not addicted to the endless campaigning and information-free
discourse endemic to political life today, there's no better time to
consider the role architects can, do, and should play in the political
process. Further, this political season begins just one year after a cadre
of candidates was chosen in states and Congress pledged to move political
power to the states.

Most of the attention-getting debate this year has been at the national
level, as the budget, regulations, and such massive programs as Medicare
and welfare have come under intense scrutiny. And the big Capitol Hill
battles have pushed aside for now issues that most affect building design
(tort reform, qualifications-based selection). Bricks-and-mortar building
programs have been substantially cut, however [RECORD, November 1995, page
33]. Even if, as many in the new Congress advocate, programs are eliminated
and others largely shift to states, government still significantly
determines the circumstances under which buildings are designed and built.
Can design professionals better use the political process to realize their
goals? Perhaps more fundamentally, is the shift from national to local and
the move to greater privatization good for architects?

``Architects' interests don't really fall along party lines,'' observes
Nancy Somerville, vice president, state and local government affairs at the
AIA. ``What does follow party lines is the anti-regulatory environment and
the pro-business environment. These agendas mean there's a greater
likelihood of tort reform but, on the other hand, a resistance to uniform
building codes and more efforts to consolidate or defund agencies like
state licensing boards.'' Although much of the political drama is in
Washington, D.C., ``Most legislation where rubber hits the road in terms of
architects' income,'' Somerville says, ``takes place at the state level.''

What government is doing to design
   Somerville and Daniel Gross, AIA program director, state and local
government affairs, outline these key challenges:

Procurement: As many as 14 states will face challenges to
qualifications-based consultant selection criteria. Also, although AIA
policy accepts design/build for appropriate projects, AIA is challenging
design/build procurement when it is cost-driven, not qualifications-driven,
and when a high level of uncompensated work is required for selection. Some
states, ``unhappy with the level of litigation on projects,'' but also
``not managing the process well,'' says Somerville, see alternate-delivery
methods as a panacea.

Professional licensing: The deregulatory mood, says Somerville, has spurred
a ``large-scale attack on the regulation of professions.'' She says critics
claim ``that most state licensing exists for protection of the regulated
and not the good of society.'' Though she feels that architects will have
to fight battles on this front (10 states face ``sunset'' of licensing laws
in 1996), she doesn't see the licensing of architects as threatened.
Indeed, 12 states may add a licensing category--through certification or
title laws for interior designers.

The definition of architectural practice (where, typically, engineers seek
authority to design a wider range of building types) and the overlap of
engineering with architecture ``top the list of licensing-law concerns'' in
the states, says Somerville [RECORD, July 1995, page 27].

Liability and tort reform: Professionals are seeking ``certificate of
merit'' legislation in many states, which would require early independent
examination of whether suits against architects (among others) have merit.
Some states have exposed architects and engineers to liability for
third-party suits. This permits injured workers--prevented from suing
contractors by workers' compensation statutes--to seek recompense from the
design team. Other states have relieved architects from such liability.
Tort reforms sought by A/Es include caps on punitive damages and on
joint-and-several liability. The latter can make the ``deep pockets''
architect (or the firm's insurer) liable for damages far in excess of
proven culpability.

Selling architecture on Capitol Hill
   In Washington, the budget-cutting vogue brings bad news for architects,
especially for firms that have been doing big GSA courthouse and
office-building projects. It's not only GSA budgets that have been cut,
though. Assisted-housing programs at HUD, embassies, R&D (which supports
much campus research-lab construction), transit and passenger rail, and
Veterans Administration hospitals have all been slashed. Of those
categories where spending is rising, only slightly higher funds for
airports and dollars for military-housing improvements are likely to
directly benefit architects.

Should architects storm Congress' ramparts? It's not AIA's style. ``We play
with the deck we're dealt,'' says Al Eisenberg, director, federal
legislative affairs at AIA. Don't mount a monumental (and probably losing)
battle to restore cuts in building programs, he says. ``Congress believes
that the tax code is the way to get things done rather than categoric
grants or block grants. If the arena to play in is the tax code, we'll play
in that arena.'' Thus AIA is vigorously defending the Low Income Housing
Tax Credit and tax credits for historic preservation (both of which will
likely remain intact), and promoting the Commercial Revitalization Tax Act
targeted at distressed urban areas and supporting a tax credit for those
who restore historic homes (both an uphill fight).

Clout through community design
   Architects have influence in Congress, claims Eisenberg, because they
help to make ``livable communities.'' That architects are able to
facilitate public participation as well as build projects that tangibly
benefit towns and cities is crucial, because ``all kinds of legislation
flows to communities.'' He cites, for example, ``the transportation
enhancements'' set-aside from the surface transportation program--part of
what is popularly known as ISTEA [RECORD, June 1994, pages 86-89].

The community-oriented focus is also seen as critical by Harvey Gantt, of
Gantt Huberman architects in Charlotte, N.C. Gantt, perhaps America's most
prominent architect-politician says architects have much to offer,
especially locally: ``Architects have an ability to visualize; they can
understand the physical impact of social decisions. When I served on the
city council and as mayor of Charlotte, I thought I could visualize impact
of a highway more readily than a colleague who is a sales person or a
lawyer.'' (Gantt has also served as Charlotte's mayor pro-tem.)

That architects can create a new vision for communities is also key to what
Eisenberg says are the excellent prospects for one little-publicized
legislative initiative. The work of architects, planners, engineers, and
landscape architects in Hurricane Andrew, in Florida; the giant 1993 floods
in the Midwest; and the recent earthquakes and wildfires in California has
convinced many in Congress that disaster-mitigation planning is critical in
avoiding gigantic losses [RECORD, June 1994, pages 38-41]. In return for
offering government backing to a federally chartered private insurance
corporation, at-risk states will have to make comprehensive
disaster-mitigation plans and put in place new or upgraded zoning and
codes. Both the planning process and the construction upgrading involved
should generate substantial work for architects. That the bill has 220
House co-sponsors is important, says Eisenberg, because ``this is a
Congress that is not about telling states what to do.''

Architect as local peace-maker
   Many architects see expanded opportunities if the shift to local
government and privatization continues. They agree with proponents of small
government that the lower taxes permitted by less government translate into
more money deployed more efficiently by the private sector. Indeed, there
has been a long-term shift of U.S. architects' clients from government
(still the dominant patron in much of Europe) to the private sector.

Removing federal-government regulatory burdens may not change the life of
the average architect much, though. Architects frequently complain that the
thicket of local regulations, design-review, and community-review boards
through which even private-sector projects must pass too often saps
innovation--let alone excellence. Clients also often see such activities as
incidental and expensive barriers to the main event--designing buildings.

Dealing with community needs shouldn't be incidental, argues Dana Cuff,
associate professor at UCLA's Department of Architecture and Planning.
She's made a study of what she calls ``contentious development,'' and
observes that inevitably ``architecture ends up in the political realm,
when you talk about how architecture adds up to a city.'' Many architects
can bring highly developed design, graphics, and communication skills to
bear in community planning and design--skills developers, planners, and
real-estate professionals often lack.

Cuff looked at Riverside South, a gigantic urban development in New York
City first proposed by developer Donald Trump as Television City--a series
of dizzyingly huge towers that attracted fierce community opposition.
Architects, some of them working pro bono, collaborated with opponents,
and, ultimately, Trump's team. The scheme approved was smaller, and vastly
more public-oriented. And Trump learned that a less adversarial approach
can work.

``You can say New York is much better off in terms of quality of life for
having had this be a 10-year, political, drawn-out process,'' observes
Cuff. ``No developer would ever do this if not pressured to.'' While
joining the opposition may not win plaudits from potential clients, Cuff
feels architects' validity within the community is too often threatened
because ``people feel let down by architects and developers.'' She sees
great opportunity for architects able to help owners steer projects through
difficult community-review procedures (though getting paid for the effort
involved remains a hurdle). She argues, ``Architects are the kind of
professionals that can work through--competently and with a vision--complex
problems that have both physical and political dimensions.''

City builders vs privatized packagers
   The tensions that arise from the level of community consultation
required in many jurisdictions reflect themes in larger political debates.
When advocates for small-government gained momentum in the 1980s, for
example, they claimed that too many architects clung to an outmoded
big-government role as community master builder imposing a personal-taste
agenda on the public. Then, as architects moved away from urban design and
low-income housing to lushly funded museum projects and glitzy edge-city
mega-developments, community advocates said that the most prominent
practitioners had abdicated their professional authority, and deserved to
be considered mere packagers and stylists, pandering to the egos of
developers and companies at the public's expense.

This quandary for architects isn't going away; indeed, such arguments may
become more polarized, and architects may find it more difficult to have a
broad role in shaping communities while still realizing the needs and
aspirations of those paying the bills. Consider two scenarios: if
government is merely localized, rather than privatized on a large scale,
architects can continue to help government agencies create genuinely public
places. But when government is privatized, then private entities, however
public-spirited, become the clients, making the relationship between the
architect and the public one more step removed. When an architect works for
a developer hired to build public schools, for example, the developer sets
the priorities the architect must address rather than an agency or the
community. While a privatized entity can offer much more efficient
management and procurement, it may not feel charged to do what government
might do, such as look to locate a public facility in a neighborhood where
it can catalyze other development.

Can architecture survive expediency?
   It is also worth considering whether the extent to which government uses
architecture reflects on the profession. In FDR's era, for example,
architects were involved in work ranging from public hospitals to park
structures to bridges--even the great Hoover Dam. Though public works from
that era remain widely admired, today's no-frills approach has made the
multi-lane freeway running in a trench of precast-concrete sound barriers
the primary experience of the public realm. One could argue that the sorry
nature of much public work today reflects people's attitude toward
government, not architecture. But we shouldn't dismiss a more pessimistic
conclusion--that people no longer see design as a means of representing
their community's or their nation's aspirations. Do we need government
architecture (which is supposed to represent us all) to help validate the
profession in the eyes of the public?

Gantt, on the other hand, says the perception of public design ``goes up
and down with the community. Architects should be focused on quality of
life,'' he continues. ``We can influence what we're surrounded by: how you
reinforce neighborhoods, how you keep downtowns from being ghost towns
after dark.'' The more the public recognizes architects' positive
contribution to ``what it takes to produce that intangible--a city that
feels good to people,'' he says, the more the community will ask architects
to do.

Gantt urges architects to testify in front of planning committees, to be
involved in charettes or with community groups. ``When I sat on major
decisions on how Charlotte's downtown was going to develop or major
infrastructure developments, developers, bankers, and other people would be
there, but no architects were there talking about appropriateness.
Architects are not even thought about in that light.'' In public debates,
Gantt says, ``No one thinks twice about an up-and-coming lawyer appointed
to some board. An architect is a rarity, though, and there's no reason for
that. It's great to be thought a nice guy who builds buildings, but in
order to get clout one has to get one's hands quote dirty in the arena of
politics.''

The defensive nature of many of the battles architects fight--fee bidding;
the clients, engineers, and builders that think architectural design is at
best an add-on--may be inevitable in an ever-more competitive age, or it
may be evidence of a continued devaluation in status. Certainly in today's
political environment, where first cost is the chief value, architecture is
targeted. AIA's Eisenberg, like most architects, argues for the community
values that are represented through a selection process that focuses on
design excellence and by construction that uses stone or wood rather than
drywall and carpet in an important public place like a courthouse. In
pandering to those who claim all government spending is waste, however,
politicians regularly pick on the ``lavishness'' of materials that are
completely justifiable in life-cycle or other terms. In such an atmosphere,
only timid design makes it through.

Eisenberg, for one, sees the ``devolution'' of national standards and
programs as ``a rush to the bottom,'' where local expediency precludes
solutions to national problems. He sees it increasingly difficult ``to make
people understand what architecture does.''

Gantt says the purely cost-driven approach can be defused: ``I think
architects in places of prominence can make some solid arguments about the
appropriateness of architecture and its impact on our lives. And they can
win an argument on that level if costs and taxes are not the overriding
concern in the community.'' By being consistently involved in issues of
interest to the community, architects ``will have an audience who will
listen,'' Gantt says, when they try to make a case for a genuinely civic
architecture over a purely low-cost one. Gantt is making his own case by
running for the U.S. Senate in 1996.

for headline-seeking politicians. Also, if federal cuts create new burdens
for states and cities, locally funded schools and libraries, which have
been consistently strong types recently, could be hit..

CAD PRESENTATIONS GET REAL
Architects are increasingly turning computer savvy to imaging, offering
options conventional renderers can't--and stretching computing's
frontiers.

By:
By Ralph Grabowski

For the architect who does not have the time or the skill, there have
always been delineators and modelmakers to prepare handdrawn illustrations
and presentation models. Now, delineators have gone digital: they render 3D
CAD instead of illustrations; make animations instead of scale models.

Very often, it is the client who wants the rendering rather than the
architect. It is traditional for the client to pay for these as marketing
tools--to get governmental approvals, pre-lease the building, impress
potential investors. Most imaging firms concentrate on high-quality
renderings, since they have found these are the best way to get the design
idea across to the client.

While an animation is impressive, it tends to skip over details; plus, the
camera paths can be like a roller-coaster ride. Ayres Group, San Diego, a
firm specializing in animations, finds itself increasingly sought after by
international clients, according to Molly Scanlon, director, client
services.In deciding whether to commission an animation, she says, ``you
need to define a purpose and an audience.'' One area Ayres and others
concentrate on is presenting the impact of new development. Besides
describing the appearance of the design, computer images or animations can
readily show building heights and sight lines, view corridors, and other
designed responses to zoning and planning issues.

Some firms specialize in producing multi-media presentations. They package
sound, text, and images on the computer with Microsoft PowerPoint or
Astound presentation software. A speaker can show the images at meetings
using a notebook computer and LCD display panel (which transforms the
computer image into one that can be projected on a screen). Ayres Group's
Scanlon says ``During construction, we'll run our animations as an
information kiosk, instead of a `pardon our dust' sign, to explain to
visitors why they're being inconvenienced.'' Other firms offer
project-archiving services. They scan as-built paper drawings for storage
on CD-ROM or tape (for easy retrieval or conversion to CAD files), and make
a film or video record of built projects.

Raw materials
   Imaging services can start with hand-drawn sketches, design drawings,
and CAD files--whether 2D or 3D. To make the drawing or rendering, the
service must make a 3D CAD drawing of your project. Obviously, the less
work the service has to do, the less it costs, so it's to your benefit to
provide the project in electronic form. Among CAD files, the most common
format is AutoCAD DWG or DXF. You deliver the files on 3 1/2-in. diskette,
upload to a bulletin-board system, or e-mail the file directly through the
Internet or through an on-line service like CompuServe.

The right viewpoint
   Once the 3D model is constructed, other 3D data might be added, such as
digital terrain modeling (DTM)--the computer term for the site profile. You
can examine the model on-screen while an operator changes the angle,
viewpoint, and distance until you agree on the desired point of view. The
service will ask you for the colors and materials intended for the project.
It typically has a large selection of already-digitized materials. Many are
available commercially as ``clip-art libraries'' on CD-ROMs, such as
surface textures for granite, marble, masonry, tile, and carpet.

These items can be copied from the source and pasted into the rendering.
Items such as trees, seating, trash containers, automobiles, and people,
can also be added from standard clip-art libraries. If need be, a texture
can be created from scratch in three ways. Flat samples, such as tiles and
wallpaper, are digitized using a high-resolution, full-color, flatbed
scanner. For materials that can't be scanned, such as bricks, you can
photograph a sample, and use the Kodak PhotoCD process to create an
electronic image. As a last (labor-intensive) resort, the service can
create a surface texture by using a computer ``paint'' program. Whether
scanned or photographed, the digital images become ``texture maps'' applied
to the surface areas of the 3D drawing.

Since many digital-image firm principals are architects, they can produce
credible surface colors and textures, even if the design is at an early
stage and materials selection isn't final. Being digital, it's easy to
change the color and texture at a later stage in the project. For
animations, the client, architect, and imaging firm agree on the camera
path through the project.

With the model's 3D viewpoints established, the file is exported to a
rendering program like Autodesk's 3D Studio. Here, the texture maps are
applied, the lighting parameters are defined, and the rendering takes
place. The time it takes to render depends on the quality of rendering, the
complexity of the model, and the speed of the computer. An anti-aliased
Phong rendering (which includes textures, shadows, and lighting effects)
may take a few minutes. A four- to five-minute animation can take more than
two days to render on Ayres Group's 25 machines.

After the imaging firm applies the texture maps, the client and architect
are invited to approve the placement. It is at this point that you may
decide the colors or materials are not what was intended. Richard Buday, of
Archimage, Houston, tells the story of a designer client sitting in his
office with paint chips and swatches of vinyl and carpet. After the
operator rendered the image as directed, the designer exclaimed, ``No, no,
the colors need to be darker here and lighter there.'' Working together,
they changed the materials and re-rendered the scene until she was pleased.
The designer returned to her office to find materials matching the screen
colors.

While one can see the scale and relative amount of colors and textures in
such a rendering, the subtleties of color in the real world are not
accurately interpreted by the computer screen. The color you perceive is
altered by many environmental factors--time of day, weather, reflections
from moving objects, and the mix of light sources--that are hard to
simulate. Also, if the image is printed, the deviations from screen color
can be dramatic, unless screen and printer are carefully calibrated. The
efforts in the field of CAD and illumination have resulted in rendering
packages now capable of shadows, reflections, and accurate rendering of the
amount and color of light. Still, research has yet to give us tools to
present colors accurately on the screen and then output them identically on
any color printer.

The output
   The output from the computer is generally a high-resolution, true color,
Targa or TIFF file. The ``high resolution'' is on the order of 2,048 by
1,526 pixels, which is four times the resolution of a typical computer
screen. ``True color'' means the monitor is set to show up to 16.7 million
colors or 24-bit color depth. Such high resolution and color depth means
that the size of files is very large, on the order of 74MB uncompressed.
Compression techniques can reduce files to 4MB--still too large to fit on a
standard diskette. For this reason, you'll need to deliver files on a
Bernoulli disk or other large-capacity medium.

To get hard copy of the image, you normally work with yet another outside
agency. Reprographics firms can produce slides (using a digital film
recorder), 8 1/2 by 11 prints (using a digital printer), and 24- by 36-in.
posters (using a color inkjet plotter). Digital reprographics firms are so
common in all large cities that they often offer incentives for the
first-time customer.

Computer-imaging advantages
   Imaging firms say a single computer rendering has no cost or time
benefit over a single illustration created by hand. It probably takes just
as long and costs as much or more. The savings come when you make
additional scenes from the same model or make changes. After creating one
``database'' (the 3D CAD model), it's easy to create multiple views. Once
the lighting is set and textures applied, it's also easy to generate
additional scenes from other viewpoints. For traditional hand-drawn
renderings, the illustrator starts from scratch for every view.

What technology can't do
   David Burch, of Jenkins & Associates, an architectural firm in Calgary,
Alberta, points out an inconvenient aspect of computer imaging: the 3D
model must be complete. Otherwise surfaces don't meet and shadows fall
incorrectly. In a hand drawing, you can always place a tree or other visual
subterfuge to obscure the not-yet-designed elements.

The imaging firms consulted agreed that computers also cannot match the
feel and detail of a hand-made rendering. While it is easy for an artist to
paint individual leaves on a tree, the memory needed for a computer to draw
every part of a tree is tremendous. The file size become unmanageable and
rendering time excessive. Instead, the firms try to do 90 percent of the
work in the 3D model. Then they soften the hard lines and slick surfaces
using touch-up applications like Adobe PhotoShop and Fractal Design Corp.'s
Fractal Design Painter.

Burch warns that clients may see more in the hard lines and fully developed
models than is actually there. They perceive an early study as a design
cast in stone. Jenkins uses several techniques to make the computer image
seem more tentative: He adds a pastel wash to the background instead of
dropping in a photorealistic one; he makes the walls transparent so the
client can see into the building. And some programs permit the application
of the electronic equivalent of ``brush strokes'' to make the computer
image look more like a watercolor. (Burch estimates 10 percent of his time
is spent in PhotoShop.)

Similarly, computer animations, once the image sequence has been recorded,
don't permit other viewpoints--at least until virtual reality becomes
practical. Still, animation lets people see the project from a realistic
viewpoint, rather than the helicopter viewpoint of physical models. You can
choose the way you view a physical model, but they're fragile and hard to
move around. For very large projects, such as the vast new cities being
built in China and Thailand, animation becomes the only practical method
for understanding the proposed site.

Computer imaging's cutting edge
   There's a consensus that virtual reality is still not worth pursuing at
present. The head-mounted display, data glove, and body suit environment,
while immersive, provide a rather crude image--even now, seven years after
work began on the technology. Robert Jacobson, of Worldesign, Inc.,
Seattle, builds virtual rooms by making spaces of projection screens that
allow you to be surrounded by a virtual scene. ``Ours is low resolution,
but you move through at a natural pace. Others are high resolution, but
slower,'' he says, adding that faster machines available as early as next
year will make a significant difference. The University of New Lisbon, in
Portugal, he says, is pioneering uses of 3D modeling for geographical
information systems (GIS), which could have broad application in design and
planning.

Increasingly, you can choose the direction you'll move through a scene,
like the popular computer game, Myst. Apple Computer's QuicktimeVR lets the
viewer move 360 deg. around a single viewpoint (http://www.ap-ple.com).
``We're moving into interactive, full-immersion spaces and full-motion,''
says Lance Hammer, whose firm, Simulacra, West Hollywood, Calif., uses
powerful Silicon Graphics Workstations to run high-end programs like Alias
Power animator and Pixar Renderman (the product behind the film Toy Story).
``Pure interactivity is coming very quickly.'' Hammer's firm, which began
using computer visualization in architecture, moved away from buildings to
movies and advertising, but now finds itself returning to buildings--with a
twist. A project for Dreamworks--still mostly under wraps--envisions a
``real'' architectural threshold to a virtual, but architectural space.
Hammer's firm is designing both.

The purchase by Microsoft of the French workstation package Softimage, he
says, may soon bring extremely fast tools to desktop computers. Silicon
Graphics competes, he says, ``by releasing something really incredible
every year.''

The Internet's World Wide Web is already being used as an advertising
medium and an e-mail link. Publishers Depot at http://www.publishers
depot.com offers stock photos, maps, audio clips, video footage, fonts, and
works of art for browsing and purchase. Virtual-reality modeling language
(VRML) offers even greater on-line potential. Using simple viewer software
(usually offered free), you can move around a 3D object posted on the Web.
Elements of the scene need not be located all on the same Internet site,
which could mean that the model could be worked on and viewed by numerous
parties working independently.

Today, the Internet's bandwidth is too low for this kind of interactivity.
(Though Caligari offers ``3D home worlds'' at http://www.caligari.com/.) By
the end of the decade, such collaboration should be more mainstream. One
ambitious project is VirtualSOMA, an attempt to model part of downtown San
Francisco south of Market Street using VRML at http://project9/soma.html.
By using a VRML viewer, such as InterVista's WorldView, you walk through
and fly around the district.

What should computer imaging cost?
   No conventions appear to exist for pricing. A Canadian imaging firm drew
up a proposed shopping mall in 3D CAD, then created a half-dozen
high-resolution renderings for a total of CDN$8,000. A San Francisco firm
charges $85 per hour for 3D CAD modeling and rendering. Photo compositing
is more complex than straight rendering: the computer model is pasted into
a photograph of the location. A recent project was priced at $3,800 for the
first photo composition and $1,100 for each additional composed viewpoint.
Ayres Group charges as little as $5,000 for a simple animation. Complex
jobs run up to $100,000.

But don't expect a happy ending to this story. The outsourcing of digital
architectural illustrations is not a booming business. Aside from Ayres
Group, the firms surveyed were unanimous in stating that there isn't enough
business in architecture to make computer imaging full-time work. The
principal of one firm told me, ``We are not actively marketing to
architects, although we have done work for architects when they find us and
we are happy to do it.''

To find the happy ending, these firms look elsewhere. Archimage markets to
producers, directors, and ad agencies. Simulacra did computer-generated
architectural backgrounds for Batman Forever (previous pages); the project
was so demanding, the hardware required a movie-studio budget, and Alias
had to write custom software. Creative Communications takes their
experience in architecture and applies it to visualizations for
non-architectural clients, such as government agencies and developers.


Illustration(s):
Illustration: Four Screens: Simulacra used film-effects tools in
visualizations for the CineMania Theater (1, opposite and RECORD, August
1994, pages 62-63) for architect Ellerbe Becket, and the City Center
Concert Hall in Kuala Lumpur (2) for Cesar Pelli and Associates. The firm
has gone Hollywood, adding its architectural expertise to Batman Forever
(3). Jenkins Associates modeled a small spa (4). Some surfaces can be made
transparent so clients can see inside.

Illustration: Two Screens: Using one computer model Jenkins Associates is
able to produce numerous views of a new town plan, called Angus Glen
Village, slated for Markham, Ontario (5, 6). The different views allow
potential buyers to understand how the streets and public spaces create a
sense of place.

Illustration: Screen: For Gensler and Associates' Los Angeles office, Ayres
Group produced an animation of an expansion of San Diego's Lindbergh Field
(7). The animation explains design concepts and provides a tour of the
entire project. Scenes include meticulously detailed images such as the one
below that feature complex lighting effects and the ability to see inside.

DECEMBER DECISIONS IN CASES CONCERNING ATTORNEY'S FEES

Hunzinger Construction Co. v.  *
Granite Resources Corp.
538 N.W.2d 804 (Wis.App. 1995)
A contractor suffered loss of productivity as a result of a supplier's
late delivery. But the contractor's purchase order issued to the

DECEMBER DECISIONS IN CASES CONCERNING BIDS -- MISTAKES

Bay Pacific Pipelines, Inc., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-265659 (December 18, 1995)
Although the invitation for bids stated that unit prices would govern
over extended prices, it was apparent, based on the government's
estimate and other bid prices, that the bidder had inadvertently added a
zero to its unit price. The procuring agency properly allowed correction
of the bid and displacement of the apparent low bidder, because the
agency may compare prices when determining the bidder's intent as
reflected on the face of the bid itself.

Colonnelli Brothers, Inc. v.  *
Village of Ridgefield Park
665 A.2d 1136 (N.J.Super.A.D. 1995)
A bid should have been corrected to become the low bid because the
solicitation stated that in the event of a discrepancy between unit
prices and extended totals, the unit prices would govern.

DECEMBER DECISIONS IN CASES CONCERNING BIDS -- RESPONSIBILITY

Herb Richards Construction Co., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-262177 (November 20, 1995)
An agency determination that a bidder was affiliated with a debarred
individual and therefore ineligible for award was reasonable. The
individual in question signed the bid in his capacity as project
manager.

DECEMBER DECISIONS IN CASES CONCERNING BIDS -- RESPONSIVENESS

Adler Construction, Inc., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-261506.2 (November 7, 1995)
Language in bid made it unclear whether the bidder intended to provide
an ozone treatment system in accordance with the specifications. A post-
bid opening explanation was not permissible. The bid was nonresponsive.

DIT-MCO International, Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-261976 (October 31, 1995)
An agency's rejection of a proposed product under a "brand name or
equal" specification was improper. The features that were allegedly
missing were not identified as salient characteristics in the
specifications. The bid was therefore responsive.

Harvest Construction Co., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-267513 (November 16, 1995)
A commercial bid bond form which extinguished the surety's liability if
the bidder paid the costs of its default was deficient. The federal
regulations require the surety to pay all costs up to the penal amount
of the bid bond. The bid was nonresponsive.

Kelton Contracting, Inc., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-262255 (December 12, 1995)
A hand-carried bid was received by agency personnel prior to the
designated time set for bid opening. The agency mishandled the bid. The
bid was responsive.

Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-261603 (October 11, 1995)
Although a low bid may have been mathematically unbalanced, there was no
evidence of enhanced prices. The bid was not materially unbalanced and
was therefore responsive.

Robinson & Company, Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-265656 (December 1, 1995)
The failure to acknowledge an amendment to the bid solicitation which
affected Davis-Bacon wage rates rendered the bid nonresponsive.

Shackelford Mechanical, Inc., Matter of  *
Comp. Gen. No. B-261948 (November 1, 1995)
A bid bond was defective because the surety's certification that the
agent's power of attorney had not been revoked was undated. The bid was
therefore nonresponsive.

Tec Electric, Inc. v.  *
Franklin Lakes Board of Education
665 A.2d 803 (N.J.Super.L. 1995)
The omission of a prequalification affidavit with a bid was an
immaterial defect. It was an abuse of discretion for the public project
owner to refuse to waive the irregularity.

A contracting officer properly deleted small disadvantaged set-aside
provisions from an invitation for bids, based upon a government
suspension of the applicable regulation.

clause in the subcontract.

Palm Beach County v. Trinity Industries, Inc.  *
661 So.2d 942 (Fla.App. 1995)
When the estimated value of an indefinite quantity construction contract
exceeded the statutory threshold, the public project owner owed a duty
to subcontractors to assure that the prime contractor furnished a valid
payment bond.

In re Liquidation of  *

908 S.W.2d 184 (Mo.App. 1995)
A project owner's damages for a paving contractor's deficient
performance were the cost of repair, not the diminution in fair market

DECEMBER CASES SETTLED IN ILLINOIS

North River Insurance Co. v. Jones
655 N.E.2d 987 (Ill.App. 1995)
Under the Illinois anti-indemnification statute, parties participating
in construction activities cannot be indemnified against losses caused
by their own negligence.

For Holmes Protection: Robert Arroyo, Chicago, Ill.

Premier Electrical Construction Co. v.
American National Bank of Chicago
656 N.E.2d 157 (Ill.App. 1995)
A subcontract clause stating that the subcontractor would be paid
regardless of a conflict between the prime contractor and the owner
superseded a "pay-if-paid" clause in the subcontract. The sub was
entitled to payment regardless of nonpayment by the owner to the prime
due to the owner's insolvency.
For Premier: Patrick Mazza, Chicago, Ill.
For Morse/Diesel, Inc.: Peter D'Ambrosio, Vienna, Va.

Season Comfort Corp. v. Ben A. Borenstein Co.
655 N.E.2d 1065 (Ill.App. 1995)

written notice it was on the job site. Actual knowledge of the owner was
not sufficient to satisfy the mechanic's lien statute.
For Season: John Passarelli, Arlington Heights, Ill.
For Borenstein: Alvin Becker, Chicago, Ill.

Colonnelli Brothers, Inc. v. Village of Ridgefield Park
665 A.2d 1136 (N.J.Super.A.D. 1995)
A bid should have been corrected to become the low bid because the
solicitation stated that in the event of a discrepancy between unit
prices and extended totals, the unit prices would govern.
For Colonnelli: Thomas Cosma, Roseland, N.J.

Tec Electric, Inc. v.
Franklin Lakes Board of Education

For the Board: Stephen Fogarty, Rutherford, N.J.

632 N.Y.S.2d 705 (N.Y.A.D. 1995)

For Kauffman: Kevin Laurilliard, Albany, N.Y.

Tully Construction Co., Inc. v. United Minerals, Inc.

DECEMBER CASES SETTLED BY THE ARMED SERVICES BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS

ACC Alderman Construction Co., Appeal of
ASBCA No. 43958 (November 9, 1995)
The per diem liquidated damages amount was a reasonable forecast of the
actual damages the government would incur as a result of lack of use of
the facility. The provision was not an unenforceable penalty and there
was no excusable delay. The contractor was liable for damages from the
contractual completion deadline until the date the government took
beneficial use and occupancy of the building.
For ACC: Arthur Vega, San Antonio, Tex.
For the government: Thomas Marcey, Washington, D.C.

Cramer Alaska, Inc., Appeal of
ASBCA No. 47725 (October 11, 1995)
Although the government did not return leased equipment at the
stipulated time, the contractor's damage claim was too speculative.
For Cramer: Richard Haggert, Anchorage, Alaska.
For the government: Michael Hoover, Washington, D.C.

DECEMBER CASES SETTLED BY THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL

Adler Construction, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-261506.2 (November 7, 1995)
Language in bid made it unclear whether the bidder intended to provide
an ozone treatment system in accordance with the specifications. A post-
bid opening explanation was not permissible. The bid was nonresponsive.
For Adler: Rosemary Hayes.
For the government: Christopher Kneib.

Bay Pacific Pipelines, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-265659 (December 18, 1995)
Although the invitation for bids stated that unit prices would govern
over extended prices, it was apparent, based on the government's
estimate and other bid prices, that the bidder had inadvertently added a
zero to its unit price. The procuring agency properly allowed correction
of the bid and displacement of the apparent low bidder, because the
agency may compare prices when determining the bidder's intent as
reflected on the face of the bid itself.
For Bay Pacific: Robert Sciaroni.
For the government: Lucie McDonald.

DIT-MCO International, Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-261976 (October 31, 1995)
An agency's rejection of a proposed product under a "brand name or
equal" specification was improper. The features that were allegedly
missing were not identified as salient characteristics in the
specifications. The bid was therefore responsive.
For the government: Thomas Brown.

Harvest Construction Co., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-267513 (November 16, 1995)
A commercial bid bond form which extinguished the surety's liability if
the bidder paid the costs of its default was deficient. The federal
regulations require the surety to pay all costs up to the penal amount
of the bid bond. The bid was nonresponsive.
For Harvest: William Potter.
For the government: Allen Smith.

Kelton Contracting, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-262255 (December 12, 1995)
A hand-carried bid was received by agency personnel prior to the
designated time set for bid opening. The agency mishandled the bid. The
bid was responsive.
For the government: Emily Hewitt.

Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-261603 (October 11, 1995)
Although a low bid may have been mathematically unbalanced, there was no
evidence of enhanced prices. The bid was not materially unbalanced and
was therefore responsive.
For the government: Lawrence Little.

PI Construction Corp., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-270576.2 (December 15, 1995)
A contracting officer properly deleted small disadvantaged set-aside
provisions from an invitation for bids, based upon a government
suspension of the applicable regulation.
For PI Construction: Paralee White.
For the government: Gregory Petkoff.

Herb Richards Construction Co., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-262177 (November 20, 1995)
An agency determination that a bidder was affiliated with a debarred
individual and therefore ineligible for award was reasonable. The
individual in question signed the bid in his capacity as project
manager.
For Richards: Dennis Lind.
For the government: Allen Smith.

Robinson & Company, Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-265656 (December 1, 1995)
The failure to acknowledge an amendment to the bid solicitation which
affected Davis-Bacon wage rates rendered the bid nonresponsive.
For the government: Amy Steed.

Shackelford Mechanical, Inc., Matter of
Comp. Gen. No. B-261948 (November 1, 1995)
A bid bond was defective because the surety's certification that the
agent's power of attorney had not been revoked was undated. The bid was
therefore nonresponsive.
For Shackelford: William Purdy.
For the government: Marilyn Johnson.

pre-bid site inspection.

Radcliffe Construction Co., Inc. v.

GSBCA No. 13233 (December 4, 1995)

manager failed to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract.
For Walk: Frank Walk, New Orleans, La.
For the government: Kevin Myles, Fort Worth, Tex.

HONEYCOMBS BEEF UP PIPE

A new high-capacity polyethyleneplastic pipe that features smooth interior
and exterior walls is now available from Advanced Drainage Systems Inc.
(ads). Called N-12 hc, the pipe's ribbed walls feature a honeycomb
cross-section. This feature adds ring stiffness which serves both to
maintain the cross-sectional shape during installation and to support the
soil overburden.
The pipe is manufactured in standard 20-ft lengths and 42 and 48-in.
diameters. At just 26.5 lb per ft for the 42-in. size, compared to 680 lb
per ft for a same-sized reinforced concrete pipe, handling and installation
are relatively easy, the company says.
  Pipe ends are fitted with a bell-and-spigot gasketed jointing. Joining
pipe sections involves applying some lubricant to the ends, then pushing
them together. Prior to installation, the company recommends mechanical
compaction of the trench, which helps minimize pipe deflection.
   HDPE pipe is virtually inert and can be used in aggressive environments,
such as landfills and hazardous waste sites. Tight joints and long lengths
provide less chance of contamination of the surrounding soils.
   Because of the honeycomb design, the pipe can be made using much less
material per ft than solid-wall style pipe. In addition, the manufacturing
process that creates the pipe produces no waste products, the company
says.
   James B. Goddard, ADS chief engineer, says it took seven years to
develop the pipe, which the industry practice division of the Ohio Society
of Professional Engineers gave its 1995 new product award. Test
installation of ADS's 48-in-dia pipe was done by the Pennsylvania Dept. of
Transportation. It tested successfully to resist soil pressures equal to
180 ft of fill. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS INC.

AUTOMATIC PIPE ALIGNMENT SYSTEM

Model 5700 series beam aligner is designed for underground pipelaying
applications. The model is equipped with a patent pending automatic
targeting system which is operated by remote control. With the push of a
button, the laser begins to adjust to line center accurately and
automatically, the firm says. This feature allows the operator to reduce
time spent on second day set-ups. It also includes a rechargeable battery
pack that allows for over 20 hours of continuous operation. LASER ALIGNMENT

SMALLER PIPE SIZES

In addition to its existing pipe diameters of 21 to 48 in., the company is
offering smaller solid-wall pipe in 8, 10, 12, 15 and 18 in. dia for
trenchless rehabilitation and replacement projects. The pipe is
manufactured by a thermofusion process utilizing a PVC I-Beam profile
construction for increased strength and durability. These smaller pipe
sizes are suitable for use in sewer system rehabilitation and construction.

STORMWATER CHAMBER SYSTEMS

Offering over 40% more infiltrative capacity in the same length trench as a
24-in. stone and pipe septic leachfield, the Equalizer 24 is designed to
replace conventional 2-ft trench systems. Installers can dig the exact same
length of trench then install the chambers in less than half the time of a
stone and pipe system, says the manufacturer. Features include the
engineered SideWinder sidewall which is bent to attain the maximum
infiltrative surface area. INFILTRATOR SYSTEMS INC.

BORING MACHINES

Designed to help solve small diameter installations problems, the company
offers two solutions. First, for service installations up to 6 5/8-in. dia,
the Push'n Mole pipe pusher works from an excavation area no longer than 5
ft and just 10 in. deeper than the bore. It is powered by a McL-1000
hydraulic power pack or the hydraulics of a backhoe. The unit pushes a
2-in. hole at a rate of up to 5 feet per minute. Second, the Zipper auger
boring system bores from 3 to 12 in. dia. Twin hydraulic cylinders deliver
a uniform on-line thrust of 24,500 lb at 2,500 psi and the auger drive 900
ft lb torque at 2,500 psi. MCLAUGHLIN MANUFACTURING CO.

ARNOLD VOLLMER

By:
Gary J.Tulaz

Arnold Vollmer, an engineer and landscape architect who designed many of
the parks in the New York City area, died on Nov. 24. He was 80. Vollmer,
as head of the engineering firm Vollmer Associates, New York City, was long
associated with Robert Moses, the influential New York City Parks
Commissioner and head of the regional Triborough Bridge and Tunnel
Authority for four decades. Vollmer was responsible for planning and
designing over 50 parks and recreational areas and prepared the first
statewide comprehensive outdoor recreation plans for New York, Connecticut,
Indiana and Arkansas (see ENR 12/1/66 p. 39). He also was a prominent
highway designer responsible for such highways as Interstate 70 in
Colorado, I-91 in Connecticut, the Seneca Parkway in Kentucky and the
Nassau Expressway in New York.

CONSTRUCTION FARED WELL IN 1995

With the fresh release of contract awards data through November, it appears
that construction will ring up a successful 1995. Through the first 11
months of the year, contract awards, excluding residential construction,
were up 8%, according to the F.W. Dodge division of the McGraw-Hill Cos.
Among the strongest annual gains were 24% for manufacturing, 14% for
apartments, 49% for hotels and 10% for educational buildings. Overall,
awards for nonresidential work were also up 8% over 1994's level. However,
there are signs that some of this strength is starting to weaken. ``During
the fourth quarter of 1995, construction began downshifting from expansion
to stability,'' says Robert A. Murray, vice president for economic affairs
for McGraw-Hill's Construction Information Group. ``The industry was able
to avoid declines primarily due to the resilient support of the
nonresidential building market,'' he adds. Markets already showing weakness
compared to 1994 include annual declines of 8% for sewerage, 3% for
bridges, 23% for dams and reservoirs, 18% for warehouses and 27% for
prisons.

ARMY ENGINEERS BUILD BRIDGE IN BOSNIA

Battling winter weather and flooding, U.S. Army engineers successfully
constructed a bridge across the Sava River in Bosnia. The floating bridge
was the largest built by the army since World War II and uses pontoon units
copied from a Soviet system. The 22-ft-long by 26-ft 8-in.-wide aluminum
alloy units are transported folded in half on the longitudinal axis. Each
unit floats on four longitudinal pontoons that are connected to adjacent
pontoons by hinges and pins. The floating bridges provide a 13-ft
5-in.-wide roadway with a walkway on each side. Special units at each shore
are equipped with hydraulic ramps to accommodate bank heights of up to 42
in.

GENERAL ELECTRIC SETTLES WPPSS SUIT

General Electric Co. has paid $134.9 million to the Washington Public Power
Supply System to settle a 1985 suit alleging design errors in the WPPSS No.
2 pressurized water reactor on the Hanford Reservation. The settlement was
sealed by a judge in 1992 and only recently became public, says Anthony
Eitreim, WPPSS attorney. WPPSS sued in 1985, contending design errors cost
the owner $1.16 billion in revenues and 18 months in construction delays.
The settlement required GE to pay costs of boosting capacity of the No. 2
reactor at Hanford by 5%. WPPSS pulled the plug in 1983 on a $5-billion
construction program that was to build five nuclear reactors. Only one was
completed. A request for proposals to demolish the four others, a job
expected to exceed $200 million, will be out in the spring, says WPPSS
spokesperson Mary Ace.

MIAMI LOOKS FOR ALTERNATIVES TO BLUE-CHIP SEWER OVERHAUL
Under state and federal mandates, Miami must spend $1.1 billion to overhaul a
massive sewer system that had been plagued with leaks.  But project engineers
say that regulators are forcing them to build costly improvements that may

ultimately prove unnecessary.

By:
By Andrew G. Wright in Miami


Under detailed and stringent state and federal mandates, Miami is spending
$1.1 billion to rehabilitate the largest wastewater collection and
treatment system in the Southeast. The program, about one-third the way
toward a 2002 completion deadline, has more than doubled monthly water and
sewer bills since 1988, with no expected end in sight.
   To date, Miami has made all 194 milestones in the compliance orders, but
officials claim the decrees are arbitrary in places, putting construction
ahead of planning and forcing costly improvements that may be ultimately
unnecessary. The city wants the federal government to devise a sanitary
sewer overflow policy that considers local conditions, particularly a
groundwater table only 3 ft to 6 ft below the surface and average rainfall
of 60 in. per year. Otherwise, they fear, the massive upgrade will still
not bring the city's wastewater collection and treatment system into Clean
Water Act compliance.
   Wake-up call. The 400-sq-mile system comprises 2,400 miles of gravity
sewers, 640 miles of force main, 874 pump stations and three treatment
plants that together process 320 million gal per day of wastewater on
average. Peak flow tops 700 mgd. Thousands of sanitary sewer overflows,
coupled with a series of pipe and pump station failures in the late 1980s
and early 1990s, caught the attention of media, environmentalists and
regulators.
   After several well-publicized pipe failures flooded intersections
downtown and spilled raw sewage into the Miami River and other bodies of
water, many began to question the integrity of a force main under Biscayne
Bay. The 72-in.-dia Cross Bay line is the primary conduit for wastewater
from the mainland to the 143-mgd Central District treatment plant on
Virginia Key. It was built in the 1950s, when the city was desperately
trying to keep pace with booming development.
   In a 1993 agreement, the Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection
specified replacement of the line with a 102-in.-dia alternative. The job
came in a year early and well under its $72-million estimated cost (ENR
9/12/94 p. 16).
   But the regulators were just getting started. In July 1993, a second
pact with the state specified expansion of two treatment plants, odor
control improvements at the central facility, additional capacity
throughout the collection and transmission systems and expansion of a
detailed infiltration and inflow program already under way.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also stepped in, filing a
federal lawsuit that raised the same issues covered by the state's
regulators. The U.S. Dept. of Justice, representing EPA, refused to
acknowledge the settlement agreements. Miami settled the suit by signing
detailed consent decrees, the first in August 1993, and the second in
February 1995. In addition to signing off on a program currently pegged at
$1.1 billion, the city agreed to spend $5 million to build advanced
wastewater treatment works and install reuse and low-flow toilets in public
housing. Finally, Miami paid $2 million to the U.S. Treasury, the largest
penalty ever collected under the Clean Water Act.
   City officials acknowledge the repairs were overdue. But they also
maintain the settlements with state and federal regulators duplicate
paperwork and put construction's cart before design's horse. A peak-flow
study and system-wide sanitary sewer evaluation, both under way but not yet
complete, would generate a more cost-effective upgrade plan by the end of
next year, they say. The compliance documents are ``clearly a premature
enforcement of the Clean Water Act,'' says Anthony J. Clemente, director of
the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Dept.
   ``We could spend 40% less to achieve the same goals,'' estimates Luis
Aguiar, the department's assistant director in charge of transmission
systems. ``But with the agreements in place, we have no room to
maneuver.''
   EPA's intervention after the state already initiated an aggressive
enforcement program in 1993 ``really was inappropriate,'' Clemente adds. He
suspects the reason may be political, since Attorney General Janet Reno and
EPA Administrator Carol Browner are both natives of South Florida. In any
case, the city says the requirements are overlapping and heavy-handed,
mandating elimination of all sanitary sewer overflows, even though EPA has
yet to develop a national SSO policy. ``Will the regulatory agencies
recognize that all SSOs cannot be eliminated?'' asks Clemente. He adds that
EPA's regional offices do not apply the same standards across the board to
releases of raw or untreated sewage from sanitary collection systems.
   SSO SOS. EPA counters that it is drafting SSO enforcement action
guidelines, giving localities more say in developing management plans,
says Michael B. Cook, the agency's director of the office of wastewater
management. ``We want to reduce monitoring and reporting requirements by
25% within the next year,'' he told the Water Environment Federation
convention last October.
   EPA is ``moving from a technology-based approach toscientific risk-based
analysis on a cost-benefit basis,'' adds Tudor Davies, EPA's director of
the office of science and technology. But he insists, ``I don't believe
there are different quality criteria for water quality standards for wet
weather.''
   Despite EPA's promises of policy changes, the goal in Miami remains
``zero overflows from the collection system,'' says Roy Herwig, an
enforcement officer in the agency's Atlanta office. ``These overflows run
through schoolyards and playgrounds. It's a public health issue.'' He adds
that fragile ecosystems in two national parks within Dade County, Biscayne
Bay and the Everglades, could be compromised by a large-scale failure of
the county's wastewater treatment system.
   Miami has put together ``a tremendous program,'' says Herwig, who adds
that it was long overdue. ``We felt the [operation and maintenance] budget
had been inadequate for years. It's like a car. If you never change the
oil, you shouldn't complain about having to replace a shot engine.''
   Clemente and engineers with Montgomery Watson, the Pasadena, Calif.,
consultant leading program management for the department, say a consistent
SSO policy, considering actual risks and local conditions, would be more
cost-effective. ``You can engineer a brick to fly but it will be mighty
expensive,'' says Ron Ballard, MW program director.
   Expense was also a concern with EPA, says Adam M. Kushner, the Justice
Dept.'s chief attorney on the Miami case. The government filed suit to
protect public health, but also to secure its own investment. Miami had
used $300 million in federal funds to expand its system over the last 25
years, he notes, but spent little to keep it in shape. ``We're working at
the confluence of two principal problems--unstemmed growth that limited
hydraulic capacity and a failure to invest in O&M,'' he says. ``Between
1985 and 1994 we noted between 2,200 and 2,600 overflows system wide,
according to the department's own records. If somebody in Miami even
thought about rain they had an overflow.''
   Observers agree. ``There's no question that they were playing
catch-up,'' says Rick Arbour, president of Rick Arbour & Associates, Inc.,
a Hopkins, Minn., consulting engineer that has advised EPA on Miami's
problems.
   Some of those problems date back to 1973, when the city established a
single metropolitan water and sewer agency that cobbled together a large
system from 30 smaller ones. The clean water law provided federal funds so
Miami and other cities could bring their systems into compliance.
Regulators say officials found it politically expedient to take federal
money for capital expansion, while keeping customer rates low, at the
expense of the existing pipe and pump stations.
   ``Miami had one of the lowest sewer rates in the nation,'' says EPA's
Herwig. In 1988, the city billed $20.64 for average monthly levels of
10,000 gal each of water and wastewater. By 1995, to fund the compliance
orders, the levy had climbed to $44.22--comparable to rates in Dallas and
Orlando, but well below rates in San Francisco, Boston and even communities
in northern Florida.
   Best practice? Underfunding maintenance led to massive infiltration and
inflow in the deteriorating collection system. Compounding this were design
methods regarded as ``best practice'' 20 years ago, but since disproved,
says Aguiar. Oversized force mains caused widespread cavitation and in
several instances blew out manhole covers. Installing manual air release
valves and using certain pipe materials encouraged corrosion instead of
inhibiting it, as intended, he adds.
   In the late 1980s, the system started to break down frequently under
peak flow conditions. The city started an infiltration and inflow
remediation program in 1991, following an agreement with the county.
Extensive inspection of the system, mainly through smoke testing and
televised line inspections, revealed the weak spots. ``We have the largest
TV and grout fleet in the U.S.--16 trucks,'' boasts Aguiar.
   An estimated 40% of the total flow to treatment plants during wet
weather is tied to infiltration and inflow. Still, the condition ``is very
hard to quantify,'' says Aguiar. Some solutions, especially with inflow,
are inexpensive and low-tech. Smoke bombs showed extensive inflow from
missing cleanout caps on private property. The owner is responsible, but
the process--notification and follow-up to secure replacement--costs $250
per site, says Aguiar. It's cheaper and easier to supply crews with $3 caps
and replace the caps themselves.
   Plastic inserts that fit below manhole covers and seal the aperture
during storms are also inexpensive, at $7 or $8 each. Aguiar was first
skeptical these would work, ``but after putting a camera in a manhole
during a storm and watching water just pouring in, I decided to try them.''
The city has installed 55,000 since 1991 and has reduced peak flows during
wet weather.
   EPA wants 20% of the gravity system evaluated annually. Inspection crews
doubled up on repair efforts, which cost 200 to 800 hours per worker in
overtime last year, but ``kept us ahead of the curve,'' Aguiar says.
   Fixing infiltration requires more expensive, longer-term
projects--replacing and repairing pipe. The department is encouraging a
full range of techniques: grouting, sliplining, resin-impregnated liners
and pipe-bursting. Still, says Aguiar, ``this country is way behind Europe
in trenchless technology. We're just picking up on techniques they've had
for 30 or 40 years.''
   Department crews handle trenching pipe of 20 in. diameter or less, and
bid out the rest. Three projects totaling some $64 million are under
construction. They involve 17 miles of force main and interconnections of
lines ranging from 60 to 72 in. in diameter.
   Infiltration and inflow work has cut peak flow to the treatment plants
by 40 mgd and eliminated proposed capacity upgrades for 90 pump stations,
saving $10 million in construction, says Aguiar. But there is plenty of
pump station work in the program. Within the next three years, 358 stations
are scheduled for upgrading, along with construction of 60 miles of new
force main. Estimated cost is $195 million. All 874 pump stations will be
equipped with remote monitoring equipment tied together in a Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition system.
   The consent decree establishes a design criterion for the pump stations
based on a net average pump operating time for each station as 10 hours a
day. ``EPA set forth the 10-hour criteria as a short-term fix,'' says
Rosanne W. Cardoza, MW's deputy program manager. ``The peak-flow study will
show if 10 hours is correct, too much or too little.''
   No time. Post, Buckley, Schuh & Jernigan Inc., Miami, is developing a
digitized model of the collection and transmission system, due next
September, and will deliver the peak flow management study a year later.
``Houston had the advantage of a detailed water quality study that guides
the design of their whole program,'' says William M. Brant, sewer
department deputy director. ``We weren't given time to do that.''
   The study will extract data from the collection model to reach a single
goal: ``to develop a capital improvement plan that will mitigate
storm-induced wastewater overflows in a feasible cost-effective manner,''
says Marc P. Walch, a PBSJ engineer. The collection model will combine data
from the pump stations and force mains to determine how much wastewater the
system can store and transport. The peak flow study will factor in weather
impacts. In a new twist, officials will use a so-called Virtual Rain Gauge.
This computer link to weather data from satellite and ground station
reports can generate accurate storm event data every 15 minutes.
   A geographic information system combines weather information and
collection system data to forecast wastewater flow through the system in a
24-hour interval. As a design tool, it will yield data regarding
transmission capacity, pressure levels at connection points and possible
overflow points within the gravity system, says Walch.
   Miami's upgrade concentrates on the system's weakest link, the
collection system, but treatment plants will also be rehabbed. The
40-year-old central district plant features two parallel process trains
that dewater sludge before discharging treated wastewater 3 miles offshore
through a 120-in-dia. outfall. An 80-mgd pure oxygen activated sludge train
will remain on-line, but a 60-mgd high-rate activated sludge train with
open aeration tanks will be replaced by a second closed-tank pure oxygen
unit for odor control. The other two plants are also slated for capacity
expansions.
   Despite all the work, Miami's troubles with regulators may not be over.
They are now scrutinizing injection wells at the south district plant that
are used for effluent reuse. The 1983-vintage plant, scheduled for upgrade
from 100 mgd to 112.5 mgd, injects treated effluent about 3,000 ft deep
into the Florida Aquifer's boulder zone. This lies several strata and
hundreds of feet below the Biscayne Aquifer--source of Miami's drinking
water. In 1994, a monitoring well in the Biscayne Aquifer detected ammonia,
a possible indicator of treated effluent.
   The department suspects a defective monitoring well. It was capped, but
traces of ammonia have been detected at other points. The department is
negotiating with regulators to develop a remediation program. ``The burden
of proof is on us to prove that we are not the source,'' says Brant.
   The stakes are high, since the south district handles roughly one-third
of the department's sewage. Any alternative to deep injection would be an
expensive proposition for a city already on the hook for one of the most
expensive wastewater treatment capital programs in the U.S.

RECESSION SLOWS CONSTRUCTION

The year 1921 was not remarkable for construction. The recession of the
previous year continued. The value of construction in place for 1921 was $6
billion, down 10% from 1920. In 1921, $1 was worth about $9 in 1996
dollars. But in reaction, deflation occurred. The cost of materials, labor
and borrowing dropped. By year's end, the boom of the Roaring Twenties
began and 1922 would show a 26% jump in volume.
   For lack of private sector confidence in the economy, the bulk of
important construction work in 1921 was in public works, particularly
transportation. The number of trucks on the road, only 250,000 in 1916,
rose to 1.3 million. Most  existing highways and roads had been built for
horse-drawn vehicles and the burgeoning truck traffic was tearing them up.
   One of the highway triumphs was completion of a concrete highway between
New York and Atlantic City, N.J. In November, President Harding signed the
first federal highway bill making $75 million available to the states.
   Crossings. Bids were invited late in the year for foundations for a
suspension bridge linking Philadelphia and Camden, N. J. Now known as the
Benjamin Franklin Bridge, it was the first suspension design by Ralph
Modjeski. Its 1,750-ft center span made it the longest suspension bridge in
the world.
   Work began on the piers for the Belle Isle Bridge in Detroit, a
2,193-ft-long reinforced concrete arch-type cantilever bridge. Construction
was also in progress for a reinforced concrete arch bridge over the
Mississippi River at Minneapolis. It's 400-ft span would make it the
world's longest of its type. And at Fairmount, W. Va., a reinforced
concrete arch bridge crossed the Monongahela River with three
250-ft-spans.
   Buildings. Because of the recession, few buildings of note were erected
in 1921. Perhaps the most impressive was the General Motors office building
on East Grand Boulevard in Detroit. The steel-framed, 15-story building
filled an entire block and had 32 acres of floor space. The Equitable
Building in New York had 40 acres of space.
   In New York, at Broadway and Beaver St., the 30-story Standard Oil
Building was under way. At Broad and Wall streets, a 24-story addition to
the existing eight-story Stock Exchange was using the heaviest trusses and
columns known so far in office building construction.
   Today's growing use of steel-frame houses may have had its origins in a
two-story residence built in Canton, Ohio, with a steel frame.
   Bores. The Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel, subsequently known as the
Holland Tunnel, was the biggest project of the year, but mostly on paper.
Disputes between the New York and the New Jersey tunnel commissions over
the location of a railroad siding at the New Jersey end of the tunnel
stalled construction of the 8,500-ft tunnel for the entire year.
   The Liberty Hills tunnels in Pittsburgh, with double two-lane bores the
largest highway tunnels in the country, were progressing through shale at
the rate of 250 ft per month each.
   Dams. Tieton Dam, at 232 ft the record earthfill dam in the U. S., was
under construction by the U.S. Reclamation Service on the Tieton River in
Washington state as part of the Yakima project. Another distinctive feature
of the dam was its reinforced concrete core wall. The concrete barrier
extends from 100 ft below the river bed to the crest of the dam. It is 5 ft
wide at the bottom, tapering to 1 ft at the crest. Today's Bureau of
Reclamation engineers think the core was built of concrete for lack of clay
in the area. The dam work also includes a 2,200-ft-long, 21-ft-dia
diversion tunnel.
   Wilson Dam, a concrete gravity dam with navigation locks and
hydroelectric capacity, had been under sporadic construction on the
Tennessee River, near Florence, Ala., for three years. Congress decided to
shut the job down. It would subsequently be completed and become part of
the Tennessee Valley Authority operation.
   The Miami Conservancy District's $30.8-million program to prevent more
disastrous floods along the Miami River in southern Ohio progressed. Two of
five dry dams across tributaries of the Miami were completed.

HIGH WAGES, HIGH BUILDING, LONG SPANS

By:
By Joseph F. Wilkinson


Severe inflation plagued the economy and the construction industry was the
source of much of it. Although dollar volume of construction was 7% over
the previous year, inflation caused physical volume to decline. Average
hourly earnings of construction workers rose 20% during the past two years
and in 1970 increases of 15 to 20% were frequent.
   Tubes rise. This was a busy year for tubular design of buildings, in
which the perimeter columns of a high-rise form a theoretical hollow tube
to take the entire wind load. This year there were three extremely tall
tubular buildings under way in Chicago. The tallest of these and of the
entire world was the 1,454-ft-high Sears Tower, a bundle of nine tubes. The
others were the 1,136-ft Standard Oil Building (now the Amoco Building) and
the then world's tallest reinforced concrete building, the 847-ft Water
Tower Plaza. The two World Trade Center towers in New York were also
designed as tubular. Ray M. Monti, construction manager on the World Trade
Center for the Port of New York Authority, was named Construction's Man of
the Year.
   Record spans. The precast concrete box girder bridge, long common in
Europe, made its debut in North America. A 1,990-ft curved bridge of this
type was announced for Nova Scotia's Bear River. The Texas Highway Dept.
would also use segmental construction for the main span and two side spans
of a bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway near Corpus Christi.
   A new method of designing steel highway bridges, load factor design,
promised savings of 10 to 15% in steel.
   In Germany, a box girder bridge on the Rhine River failed while under
construction, killing 13 men. Cracks were also found in the stiffeners of
the five-year-old steel box girder suspension bridge over the Severn River
linking England and Wales.
   In downtown Rio de Janeiro, a 402-ft three-span concrete viaduct under
construction collapsed, killing 24 persons.
   The fastest lift bridge in North America, a double bascule over the Lynn
River in Port Dover, Ont., was supposed to open and close its leave within
30 seconds to accommodate fishing boats. At the inaugural opening, an
official hit the switch and the leaves shot up and kept on going until they
had destroyed their hydraulic systems and their concrete foundations.
   The largest sunken tube segments used so far in the U. S. were creating
a tunnel for Interstate 10 under the Mobile River at Mobile, Ala. In New
York's East River, tunnelers were sinking four-barreled tubes to form a
crossing for two subway and two railroad tracks.
   A methane blast killed 16 men in the trouble-plagued San Fernando water
tunnel, a 5.5-mile link in the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California system. The first 17,000 ft went smoothly, but then miners
encountered 1,400 gpm of water. An earthquake on Feb. 9 also offset the
east portal.
   Clean rivers. The national interest in clean streams and the reluctance
of politicians to vote against pollution control measures produced $1.2
billion worth of sewerage contracts in 1971 and a promise of $1.7 billion
more in 1972. An example of the potential was New York City's North River
Water Pollution Control Plant, which was let for a bid of $228.9 million,
the largest single nondefense contract in the Western Hemisphere.
   In transportation, the Interstate Highway program passed the
three-quarter mark toward its goal of 43,500 miles. And the Defense Dept.
began phasing out the nine-year-old construction program that was carried
out by private construction companies. The $2-billion worth of work
included hospitals, roads, ports, airfields, military housing and depots.

EAGER TO BUILD BUT MATERIALS ARE SCARCE

World War II was over and peace was wonderful for the construction
industry--sort of. Everyone wanted to build something. There was a
construction backlog of $35 billion, with $1 being worth about 10  1996
dollars. But there were hardly any materials or equipment with which to
build. The federal government, which retained its wartime control of
materials and machinery, was intent on providing housing for returning
veterans. Housing received the bulk of material.
   Still, ENR reported construction contracts for $1,846 billion worth of
commercial buildings. That was a jump of 377% over the previous year.
   Excavation work began for the $15-million John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co. building in Boston.
   The Veterans Administration early in the year announced a $448-million
program to build 80 veterans hospitals in 39 states over the coming two
years.
   The U. S. emerged from World War II convinced that air transportation
would boom. In May, the Federal Airport Act of 1946 authorized
appropriation of $500 million in federal funds for airport construction.
   Concrete box girder bridges were a novelty in 1946. One was built in
Tacoma, Wash. This was the first full year of work under the Federal-Aid
Highway Act of 1944.
   A world record in hard-rock tunnel driving was claimed when three
eight-hour shifts of tunnelers drove 80 ft through hard granite on the Big
Thompson project in Colorado. Overall, there was a $1.3-billion backlog of
water supply work, but little actual construction was expected until the
next year.
   Los Angeles began construction of a 1-mile-long, 12-ft-dia outfall tube
that would carry the effluent from the Hyperion wastewater treatment plant
to a distant point on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
   Construction also was in the early stages for Garrison Dam, on the
Missouri River in northwest Nebraska.

BIG BRIDGES AND BIG BUILDINGS COME TO COME TO COME TO COME

The economy was recovering from the Panic of '93, but the public sector
continued to be the most important source of construction work, especially
bridges.
   The most impressive bridge under construction was the record-breaking
steel arch bridge over the Niagara gorge. Designed by Leffert Lefferts
Buck, it boasted a span of 840 ft, making it the longest steel arch.
Overall length for this railway and highway bridge was 1,268 ft. It
replaced a Roebling suspension bridge built in 1868. The bridge was
completed in 1897 and destroyed in 1938 when an ice jam sheared the arch at
the hinges.
   Buck was also the designer of the Williamsburg Bridge over the East
River in New York City, which entered early construction this year. It was
the first large suspension bridge with steel towers.
   The longest reinforced concrete arch bridge in the country was being
built over the Kansas River, at Topeka. It had five spans, the center span
125 ft long and the spans on either side 110 ft long. It was built with a
system developed by Josef Melan in which girders curved to form the arches
were embedded in the concrete.
   The Point Elice Bridge in Vancouver, B.C., a two-span Pratt truss
structure built in 1885 as a highway bridge, collapsed as an electric
railway car crossed. It was May 26, the Queen's birthday, and 55 holiday
passengers plunged to their death in the bay. A coroner's jury blamed the
street railway company.
   A forerunner of today's bridge decks was invented and patented by John
O. Pew, of the Youngstown (Ohio) Iron & Steel Roofing Co. The Pew deck was
made up of a series of galvanized and corrugated iron troughs that were
placed on bridge beams and filled with concrete to a depth of 3 in. above
the trough tops.
   Big dig. The reversal of the Chicago River to protect the quality of
water drawn from Lake Michigan was still the country's largest project, and
excavation work was 77% done. A total of 42 million cu yd of earth and rock
would have to be moved to complete the job. The end product, the 28-mile
Sanitary and Ship Canal, between Lake Michigan and Lockport, Ill., would
divert the sewage-laden Chicago River from the lake to the Des Plaines,
Illinois and Mississippi rivers.
   The link between typhoid fever and polluted water was underlined by a
report in Engineering News that the incidence of typhoid in large cities
was lowest in western Europe where water was filtered and highest where
water was taken from the nearest body of water. Chicago ranked 60 on a list
of 66.
   New York was pulling ahead of Chicago as the builder of skyscrapers.
Under construction in New York was the St. Paul Building, on Broadway below
City Hall, its 25 stories rising to 313 ft. Nearby, the Park Row Building
would have 30 stories and a height of 386 ft, the highest building in the
city. At Broadway and Pine St. the Astor Building was planned for 21
stories and a height of 300 ft.
   Chicago this year pursued area instead of height and completed the
Chicago Coliseum, which had one of the largest single-span steel arch roofs
since the buildings of the 1893 Columbian Exposition. The coliseum, 300x675
ft in plan, had a capacity of 50,000 people, second only to St. Peter's in
Rome, at 54,000.
   Subways. In Boston, the country's first subway system had been under way
since early 1895 and would be completed late in 1897. It was primarily a
cut-and-cover operation, made difficult by a contact stipulation that
two-thirds of Tremont St. and all of the trolley tracks be available from 7
a.m. to 7 p.m.
   In New York, voters approved construction of a subway system in 1894. By
1896, the system was well defined and in the hands of William Barclay
Parsons. Construction would not begin until 1900.
   The Trans-Siberian Railroad, under construction since 1892, was
one-third completed. It would run 4,350 miles from Chelyabinsk, just east
of the Ural Mountains, to Vladivostok, on the Sea of Japan.
   The finishing touches were applied to the Folsom-Sacramento Electric
Plant, a hydroelectric plant in central California that was the first
system to provide long-distance, high-voltage, three-phase transmission for
significant municipal and industrial use. It supplied power to Sacramento,
24 miles away. An important event for construction this year was the
production of the first U.S.-made automobile, the Haynes-Duryea, by the
Duryea Motor Wagon Co. of Springfield, Mass.

LINKED SOFTWARE PREVIEWS CONSTRUCTION

By:
By Matthew Phair


Tiptoeing around patients, doctors and staff during hospital renovation has
always caused big headaches. Now, a computer method that links
off-the-shelf CAD, animation and project-scheduling software is easing the
pain, at least at San Mateo County General Hospital. The method allows the
construction manager and hospital staff to ``see'' construction progress at
virtually any point in time during the schedule.
   The costs avoided by correcting design errors exposed by the method more
than paid for its development costs. Still, most new clients won't go for
it, says the construction manager.
   Software development. Modeling a construction project with CAD provides
``a clear way of communicating [it] to the general public,'' says George
Hurley, a project manager with Dillingham Construction Inc., Pleasanton,
Calif. But the development costs for the software alone can be
``incredible,'' says Pete Reck, an account manager with Jacobus Technology,
Gaithersburg, Md., and former software developer with Bechtel Corp., also
Gaithersburg.
   Trying a different approach, Dillingham contacted the Center for
Integrated Facility Engineering at Stanford University in California to see
if it could successfully tie together less-expensive off-the-shelf
modeling, scheduling and animation software. Using programs from Jacobus,
San Rafael, Calif.-based Autodesk, and Primavera Systems, Salt Lake City,
combined with hundred of hours of data entry, researchers created what one
calls ``4-D'' design--three dimensions plus time.
   Data entry. ``Getting some architects to work in 3-D has been a
struggle,'' says Hurley. To tackle the labor-intensive task of modeling the
$100-million, 200,000-sq-ft replacement facility, Dillingham paid $30,000
to fund the efforts of CIFE members Eric Collier, a student architect and
Martin Fischer, a professor of civil engineering. The two invested 320
person-hours converting 2-D architectural and structural images and data
into detailed 3-D models of the phase-one construction of the central
utility plant, plus another 880 hours modeling the shells of the other
buildings involved in the project. The models, which included over 25,000
objects, were linked to each day of the schedule. ``The costs compare to
building a 3-D [tabletop] model,'' says Fischer.''
   Team members then created animated sequences of the detailed central
plant construction and of the overall six-year construction process. For
this, they used a high-end Silicon Graphics Iris Indigo computer
workstation running Jacobus Construction Animation Toolkit and Walkthru
software programs. The output was fed to a videotape, then showed to the
hospital staff for comment.
   To tackle phase-two construction, Dillingham hired Frank Vaughn, a CAD
technician and designer, to detail a full food service area, including a
new kitchen. Vaughn created the animation and walk-through using Autodesk
3-D Studio software running on a slower Pentium-based computer.
   Error checking. The modeling process uncovered conflicts between the
architect's and structural engineer's drawings. One plan called for a
retaining-wall to be 3 ft tall, while the other indicated 15 ft.
Reconciling it before construction began led to savings that paid for the
research, says Hurley.
   ``A lot of design errors aren't getting caught up front,'' says Vaughn
of traditional work methods. Even if only the 2-D drawings of the
structure, mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems were converted to
3-D, ``hidden problems would be glaringly obvious,'' he adds.
   Dillingham is currently using the modeling process on a wing of a
120-bed, 71,000-sq-ft nursing facility in Martinas, Calif. Doing highly
detailed models of patient rooms has proved helpful, says Tom Trainor,
Dillingham project manager. Equipment that the hospital may purchase, such
as specialized beds, is also modeled in 3-D CAD. The staff can see how it
fits before it's bought, he adds.
   Though the process has paid for itself and helped Dillingham land new
business, it is a big paradigm shift. To many potential customers, ``it's a
tough sell,'' says Trainor.

BUDGET BATTLE DRAWS BLOOD

   As the partial federal shutdown entered its third week, the pain was
spreading in construction.
   The big change came Jan. 2 as the Environmental Protection Agency
started sending out stop-work notices to most Superfund contractors.
Carry-over trust fund money kept cleanups going through the first two weeks
of the current shutdown. But those revenues ran out Jan. 2.
   On that date, the agency furloughed 2,500 Superfund workers around the
country, keeping a small crew of about 80 to manage about 60 EPA-led sites
kept open because of a possible ``imminent threat'' to the public or the
environment. ``We're getting enough funding to provide security to keep out
trespassers'' in the New York region's four Superfund sites where work
continues, says an EPA spokesman.
   Risk. Some Superfund cleanups led by a private companies, states or the
Corps of Engineers also might continue, EPA officials say. But they ``might
be proceeding at their own risk,'' because of the lack of EPA oversight,
says John Frisco, deputy Superfund program director in New York.
   Work was to cease at some 380 EPA-led remediation sites and 70 removal
locations. Another 200 to 400 Superfund sites were in study, design, or
other preliminary stages. ``It's a balancing act,'' says Frisco. ``We want
to make sure we don't shut down projects where there's environmental harm
or where it will take forever to restart.''
   EPA estimates that 10,000 contractor employees will be affected by the
Superfund shutdown. Those layoffs will have a ripple effect, says American
Consulting Engineers Council President Richard Weingardt. ``People will
feel the repercussions when their businesses suffer because engineers are
forced to tighten their belts,'' he warns.
   Camp Dresser & McKee Corp. Inc. received four stop-work notices last
week, says Jonathan Curtis, president of CDM's federal cleanup unit. He
says the shutdowns could also hurt local communities that have gained
economically from cleanup work.
   At EPA, ``virtually all civil enforcement has stopped,'' says an agency
official, so no fines are being collected. ``Polluters are off the hook for
an average daily total of $3 million.'' But criminal enforcement is
continuing.
   EPA also has halted writing regulations, including a proposal to reduce
companies' EPA-related regulatory paperwork by 25%. The agency hoped to
issue that proposal by early January.
   Still, it could have been worse. Key construction agencies such as the
Dept. of Transportation, General Services Administration, Bureau of
Reclamation and Corps of Engineers were open. Granite Construction Co., a
big Watsonville, Calif., heavy-highway contractor, has seen no impact of
the shutdown, says spokesman Michael Lawson.
   Neither has Perini Corp., Framingham, Mass., says Dick Rizzo, executive
vice president for building construction. Payments have been made to Perini
on several federal jobs, he says.

CALIFORNIA SLASHES GOALS

By:
David B. Rosenbaum and Tom Ichniowski

   California continues to dare the federal government to stop the state
from halving its goal for awarding transportation construction dollars to
minority and women-owned business enterprises. The California Dept. of
Transportation has decided to reduce its combined MBE/WBE contracting goal
to 10%, down from 20%, previously the nation's highest. Federal officials
protested in October, and California replied in December. Now the state
awaits another federal response.
   Caltrans' new goal took effect in October and matches the current
federal minimum goal of 10%. But the message in the rollback is more potent
than the fact that the state still meets federal law. California is the
country's most ethnically diverse and populous state. But Gov. Pete Wilson
(R) has made himself the country's most visible opponent of affirmative
action, and had made his opposition the centerpiece of his failed
presidential bid.
   Federal officials remain hamstrung during a continuing legal review of
affirmative action. ``I would say we're not happy,'' says an official at
the Federal Highway Administration. ``Legally, the Supreme Court put us in
a very difficult position.''
   Last June, the court's decision in Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pea
redefined the legal basis for federal affirmative action programs. The
justices ruled that those programs must now meet the same ``strict
scrutiny'' test that state and local programs have had to pass since the
1989 Croson decision.
   Preferences curtailed. In an executive order last June, Wilson sharply
curtailed race and sex-based preferences not required by law (ENR 6/12 p.
8). Wilson's order led to the dismantling of, among other things, the
public-private Caltrans Business Council, established in 1991 to help
Caltrans implement its MBE/WBE programs. To comply, Caltrans set new
affirmative-action contracting goals that took effect in October but only
began receiving attention late last month. ``I think it's very unfortunate
but very consistent with Wilson's objective to eliminate affirmative-action
in the state,'' says Samuel Carradine, executive director of the National
Association of Minority Contractors.
   Last fiscal year, Caltrans awarded about 27% of its nearly $1 billion in
federal-aid dollars to disadvantaged business enterprises, notes Jeffrey M.
Reid, undersecretary of Caltrans' parent agency, the Business,
Transportation and Housing Agency in Sacramento. But meeting those goals
has cost money, Reid adds. In fiscal 1994, Caltrans spent $1.8 million more
by not awarding 30 federal-aid construction contracts to low bidders.
   Today, Wilson and Caltrans intend to expose DBEs to open competition. In
a letter to FHWA, Caltrans Director James W. van Loben Sels says that the
``changes will require that DBEs compete more effectively based on
price.''
   Still, Caltrans plans to leave in effect some local agreements, such as
that reached for the Cypress Viaduct replacement in Oakland, which has a
large minority population. The viaduct collapsed in the 1989 earthquake.
Caltrans agreed to reroute the freeway replacement away from the
residential core of blighted West Oakland. The agency also agreed to award
35% of the freeway replacement project's contract dollars to minority-owned
firms and 20% to locally owned firms. Caltrans' Reid says the agency plans
to honor all existing freeway agreements.

WANTED: LANE CLOSURE PLANS

   In an attempt to reduce lane closures on a major highway rehabilitation
in Brooklyn, the New York State Dept. of Transportation is soliciting ideas
from engineers and contractors. Faced with replacing 2 million sq ft of
deck on a 4-mile-long viaduct, the agency is prepared to spend up to
$250,000 for conceptual plans for ``alternative construction approaches,
procedural recommendations or innovative contracting mechanisms.''
   But first, interested companies must mail a one-page letter expressing
interest to reach NYSDOT in Albany no later than Jan. 30. The agency will
winnow responses and pay up to $50,000 to each of three to five firms or
teams to present their plans.
   ``It's an excellent idea. Engineers and contractors that have dealt with
similar locations will be able to save the state money,'' says Jerry White,
a vice president with NAB Construction Corp., New York City.
   Bernard Haber, managing partner of Hardesty & Hanover, a New York City
consultant, says it will be important to reduce the length of time that
construction affects the community.
   The Gowanus Expressway, Interstate 278, carries 175,000 vehicles daily,
including 470 express buses during peak travel periods. The deteriorated
steel structure of the 1941 viaduct will be rehabilitated or replaced in a
series of projects expected to total $600 million, says an agency
spokesman, Eric Foster.
   The state agency considered the current preliminary design to be the
best of the alternatives developed by NYSDOT and community and advocacy
groups. It would rebuild interchanges to improve safety and construct a new
deck along with lighting and signs.
   NYSDOT plans to start construction on the highway in 1999 and expects it
to continue for six years. The agency expects to divide construction into
four prime contracts, says Foster.

DOT DISPENSES DOLLARS

   States are getting $220.6 million in discretionary federal
transportation aid, but it's a far cry from the more than $1.3 billion they
requested.
   States sought $649.3 million for work on major bridges in fiscal 1996,
but the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act capped this
year's bridge allocation at $60.5 million and the Federal Highway
Administration only doled out $57.8 million.
   New York received the largest bridge share, $20 million. Half will go
towards a $100-million rehabilitation of a bridge over the Harlem River in
New York City. The city is expected to let that contract in March. The
other $10 million will help finance an $80-million replacement of an
Interstate 287 bridge in Westchester County. That job is expected to be let
in the fall, says a state Dept. of Transportation official.
   Eighteen states sought $687.2 million for Interstate resurfacing,
restoration, rehabilitation and reconstruction (4R) projects. But only six
were winners, gaining a total of $66.1 million.
   Oregon received the largest single award in any category: $25.8 million
in 4R aid to add lanes on I-5's Salem bypass and to upgrade the Hayesville
interchange. ISTEA mandates that U.S. DOT give preference for discretionary
aid to I-5 in Oregon and Washington.
   FHWA also awarded $39.5 million for 31 public lands highway projects in
27 states and the District of Columbia. Oregon again got the largest single
award in that category: $6 million to build an interchange at Chenoweth on
the Columbia River Highway.
   FHWA also granted $14.9 million for ferry boats, $13.4 million for
scenic byways, $9.8 million for timber bridges and $6.6 million for
National Highway System high-priority corridors.

MISSOURI PLANS A NEW MISSISSIPPI RIVER SPAN

   In anticipation of receiving funding approval from the Federal Highway
Administration, the Missouri Highway & Transportation Dept. engaged the
Kansas City, Mo., office of HNTB Corp. to design alternative concrete and
steel girder spans for a cable-stayed bridge with a 1,150-ft-long main
span.
   The estimated $86-million bridge over the Mississippi River at Cape
Girardeau, Mo., will have H-shaped pylons cast in concrete for either deck
design. Tops of the pylons will be 245 ft above the 86-ft-wide roadway.
   HNTB also produced alternative designs in steel and concrete for 1,870
ft of approaches on the Illinois side of the river. Bluffs on the Missouri
side make an approach road unnecessary, says Maury Miller, HNTB's project
manager.
   Since the bridge spans between two states, the Illinois Dept. of
Transportation, along with FHWA, will review the designs says Bill
Stroessner, a consultant design liaison engineer with the Missouri agency's
bridge division. Missouri has asked FHWA for a ``significant amount'' for
the bridge. The two states have not reached agreement on funding, but
normally they would share the balance after the federal contribution.
   Miller says the firm performed dynamic analysis on the bridge to
determine the effect of an earthquake. The area is about 65 miles from the
New Madrid Fault, so HNTB designed for a quake of 8.0 on the Richter
scale.

JAIL TIME FOR STORE'S OWNER

   A three-judge panel convicted 25 people Dec. 27 in connection with the
collapse of the Sampoong Department Store in Seoul, South Korea. The judges
convicted store owner Lee Joon of negligence and sentenced the 73-year-old
to 101/2 years in jail. His son, store president Lee Han-sang, was given a
seven-year sentence for negligence and bribing government officials. Two
local government officials received jail terms and fines and a third was
fined for accepting bribes in exchange for allowing illegal changes to the
five-year-old building.
   The June 29 collapse and subsequent fires killed 501 people, including
31 whose remains never were identified. One of those killed was Frank
Bakes, 58, a senior technical specialist with engineer Burns and Roe,
Oradell, N.J. He was working on a powerplant.
   Two store employees, two designers and a construction company official
also received jail terms for negligence. Fifteen others received suspended
sentences and fines.

FRENCH CONTRACTING GIANT INVESTIGATED

   The chairman of one of the world's largest construction companies,
Paris-based Bouygues SA, is at the center of investigations concerning
alleged illegal political contributions. Police questioned Martin Bouygues,
holding him overnight and searching the firm's main office a week before
Christmas.
   The confidential judicial investigation is believed to deal with alleged
illegal donations of company funds in the late 1980s to pay for campaign
expenses of Michel Noir, Lyon's former mayor. The firm declines to comment
while the case is pending.
   Bouygues, 43, became chairman of the firm in the fall of 1989, on the
retirement of his father, Francis, who founded the company in the early
1950s. One of Bouygues' largest domestic contracts is its share of a
35-year concession to finance, build and operate an almost 6-mile-long
north section of the Lyon ring road, including three tunnels, won in 1990.

customers of a major German engineering and construction company.
   Waltham, Mass.-based Molten Metal Technology, Inc. has been a Wall St.
darling since the technology vendor went public in 1992. The company says
its closed-loop disposal system, which subjects industrial wastes to a
3000F molten metal bath, can recover acids and ferroalloys for recycling
while capturing harmful emissions.
   Dortmund-based Uhde GmbH became aware of Molten Metal through ``our
parent company, Hoechst AG,'' says Ulrike Kuske, vice president. Under
terms of the agreement, Uhde will identify and sell at least nine projects
based on Molten Metal's process over the next four years. Uhde's backlog
is $1.5 billion. Molten Metal just recorded its first profitable quarter.
William H. Haney III, president and CEO, expects to break even for the
year.

CBI FINALIZES BUYOUT

   After two months of resisting the hostile takeover bid of industrial gas
rival Praxair Inc., Danbury, Conn., the board of directors of CBI
Industries Inc., Oak Brook, Ill., finally has voted to accept a sweetened
version of the original buyout offer. Praxair says it will sell CBI's
engineering and contracting subsidiary, Chicago Bridge & Iron Co.
   No construction company has publicly revealed an interest in Chicago
Bridge & Iron. One theory is that Praxair will wait until the unit's
backlog builds up before getting serious about a deal. ``We're looking for
the best way to get the most value,'' says a Praxair spokeswoman.
   Praxair made its original bid on Oct. 27, when CBI common stock
(CBI-NYSE) was trading at an annual low of $19 per share. Last month,
Praxair upped its offer for CBI's outstanding stock from $32 to $33 per
share. The increase apparently was enough to sway the CBI board, which had
rejected Praxair's previous offer in November and then tried in vain to
solicit other suitors. Reluctantly, the board voted Dec. 22 to accept the
new offer from Praxair.
   Five senior CBI executives apparently will pocket more than $20 million
in the deal. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the ``golden parachute'' severance payments include $9.6
million for John E. Jones, CBI's chairman and chief executive officer, and
$4.3 million for Lewis E. Akin, executive vice president in charge of the
contracting subsidiary.
   The money is payable when Praxair formally takes control of CBI later
this month. A spokesman for CBI could not be reached for comment on the
potential sale of the contracting unit or the size of the severance
payments payable to CBI executives.

DOE MANAGEMENT SHUFFLE

   In an action widely expected for months, the White House Dec. 27
nominated Scientific Applications International Corp.'s Alvin Alm to take
over the Dept. of Energy's massive environmental cleanup program. Alm, a
director and senior vice president for SAIC's Environmental Business Area,
will replace Thomas Grumbly as DOE assistant secretary for environmen-tal
management. President Clinton Dec. 20 nominated Grumbly as DOE under
secretary, the agency's third most senior position.
   Neither Grumbly nor Alm is expected to face difficulty in confirmation
hearings before the Senate Energy Committee. Just how quickly the
nominations will proceed is an open question. Over the past year, DOE
Secretary Hazel O'Leary has been heavily criticized on Capitol Hill on
issues ranging widely from the administration's position on nuclear
civilian nuclear waste disposal to per-sonal spending on overseas travel.
   Sen. Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat who has often expressed displeasure
with O'Leary, has blocked Clinton's nominee for DOE assistant secretary for
congressional, intergovernmental and public affairs since late summer.
   Prior to joining SAIC in 1989, Alm was the CEO of Alliance Technologies
Corp. and served as the board chairman and CEO for Thermal Analytical Corp.
From 1983 to 1985 he was the deputy administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   In 1970, Alm was the first staff director of the Council on
Environmental Quality and in 1973 became EPA's assistant administrator for
planning and management.
   Alm's confirmation would clear the way for his second stint at DOE. In
1977, he served as assistant secretary for policy and evaluation. Alm now
serves as cochairman of DOE's Environmental Management Advisory Board and
is on the board of the Energy and Environmental Policy Institute.
   Grumbly has headed DOE's environmental management program since 1993. He
leaves Alm a $6-billion-a-year program that continues to come under
pressure from Congress and the administration to cut costs. Although the
program largely escaped deep spending cuts proposed by the House last year,
it is certain to come under still more scrutiny from congressional budget
cutters this year. Grumbly will retain primary oversight of DOE's
environmental, waste management and nuclear material disposition issues.

TEXAS ENGINEERS WIN BANGKOK SEWER WORK

   A group of Houston engineering firms and tunneling contractors is the
first U.S. team to win a contract for a $2-billion sewerage expansion
program in Bangkok, Thailand. The venture edged out ten teams of
international competitors to win as low bidder on the $192-million award to
design, build and operate two new wastewater treatment plants and a
collection system.
   The joint venture of Pate Engineers Inc. and Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam
teamed with tunneling specialist BHR-Garver Inc. and ST Environmental
Services was awarded the four-year contract by the Bangkok Metropolitan
Authority. The group has a Thai contracting partner, Premier Enterprise
Public Co. Ltd. The contract is the third of eight that will eventually be
let in the city's 12-year program to upgrade wastewater treatment
facilities for its 12 million residents.
   Other U.S. firms participated unsuccessfully. Brown & Root Inc.,
Houston, teamed with Thailand's Sino-Thai Engineering & Construction Co
Ltd. CH2M Hill Cos., Denver, joined a team of Thai and Korean firms and
France's Soletanche Enterprise. Earth Tech, Long Beach, Calif., bid with a
Thai construction partner as well. Waste Management International and the
London-based unit of Rust International Inc., Birmingham, also competed.
   ``This is a very important move for us,'' says Gerry Pate, Pate
Engineers president. ``We've been trying to go overseas for four or five
years now.'' He says Garver was already prequalified by the Thais, having
been on bidding teams for two previous contracts.
   The treatment plants will have a total capacity of 220,000 cu m per day,
with deep tunnel and open-cut sewer lines totaling 60,000 m and pipe sizes
ranging from 500 to 2,300 mm in dia, say team officials. One of the three
plants will be a stacked, multilevel facility on a tight site. Under
separate contract, British engineers are designing a similar treatment
plant on a tight site in another part of the city (ENR 10/16/94 p. 21).
   LAN President James Cole says the next sewerage contract is expected to
be advertised in March with bidders prequalified by July.

OCCIDENTAL REPAYS COSTS FOR LOVE CANAL CLEANUP

   The U.S. government has ended one of its longest and most high-profile
environmental disputes with a ``responsible'' polluter. Occidental Chemical
Corp. agreed Dec. 20 to reimburse the government $129 million to cover
cleanup costs at the Love Canal Superfund site in Niagara Falls, N.Y. It is
the largest Superfund settlement to date.
   Under a consent decree in U.S. district court in Buffalo, Niagara
Falls-based Occidental will repay $101 million to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, which funded and directed cleanup of residential
properties between 1978 and 1989. A leachate management system remains in
operation. Another $27 million will go to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which handled emergency cleanup actions before the Superfund law
was enacted in 1980. Occidental, which also agreed to pay $375,000 to
federal agencies for natural resource damages caused by dioxin release,
``just did a turnaround,'' says an EPA source.

PLAN WOULD REVIVE AREA AROUND WHITE HOUSE

   Acomprehensive design process aims to turn the run-down area in front of
the White House into America's ``town square,'' possibly including
educational and commercial uses. But there is no firm plan or cost
estimate.
   A 13-member panel, mostly architects, brainstormed in Washington, D.C.,
for several days last month to develop ideas for the two blocks of
Pennsylvania Ave. in front of the White House and the surrounding
neighborhood. They considered more than 600 suggestions received from the
public after the area was closed to vehicular traffic last May for security
reasons.
   Although the group did not propose a specific plan, its report set forth
nine guiding principles, including retaining Pennsylvania Ave. as a
ceremonial public way, expanding the site as a national park to encompass
some adjacent properties and enhancing the connection between the park and
the rest of the city.
   The final plan could also serve as a much-needed shot in the arm to a
slumbering downtown. An active town square could ``bring life to
downtown,'' says architect M. David Lee, a principal with the firm of Stull
and Lee, Boston, and a panel member.
   The National Park Service, which assembled the study panel, will develop
alternatives to be unveiled in spring. The final plan is expected to be
presented next January.

S.F. GIANTS SET TO TRY AGAIN

   The San Francisco Giants have struck out many times trying to find
somewhere to play baseball other than in windswept, chilly 3Com Park
(formerly Candlestick Park). The team is now seeking approval for a new
$255-million plan unveiled Dec. 21. If the Giants succeed, the team will
try to become the first to build a privately financed major league ballpark
since Dodger Stadium in 1962.
   The Giants propose it for 13 acres on San Francisco Bay, close to
downtown and public transportation, in one of the sunniest areas of the
city. Plans drawn up by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum's sports designers in
Kansas City, Mo., emulate HOK's designs for completed new urban ballparks
in Denver, Cleveland and Baltimore. For the Giants, HOK's plans call for
only 42,000 seats, far fewer than the 70,207 in 3Com Park.
   The Giants still need approval for an exemption to waterfront height
restrictions. Opponents protest walling off the waterfront and encouraging
more traffic and parking in the area. The stadium plan ``has the basic
problem of violating the 40-ft-height limit on the waterfront,'' says
Norman Rolfe, a board member of San Francisco Tomorrow, an urban planning
group. Still, San Francisco supervisors may put the matter on the March 26
ballot.
   Bay Area voters have snubbed the Giants' various ballpark proposals
before: four times since 1987. ``We have listened carefully to the
suggestions of San Francisco residents, and have developed an innovative
private financing plan which is truly responsive to their wishes,'' says
Peter A. Magowan, the Giants president and managing general partner, in a
Dec. 21 release. That plan counts in part on tax breaks and revenues from
63 luxury suites and 5,200 club seats.
   The National Football League's 49ers also wants to vacate 3Com Park. By
1999, it will undergo an estimated $26-million upgrade, financed in part by
the Bay Area computer company whose name it currently bears.

SOGGY SITE TESTS THE LIMITS

By:
Paul Kemezis


   Exposed slurry trench wall in powerhouse excavation is called the
tallest of its type in the world.
   Constructing a new powerhouse and channel in a narrow strip of land
between an existing dam and an abandoned river course required two large
slurry trench walls. Workers then excavated between them. But installing
the walls was one of the largest jobs of its type anywhere.
   The parallel structural slurry walls range from 50 to 130 ft deep. They
are heavily reinforced and the largest panels are tied back with large
tendons, says Jayant N. Sheth, senior structural engineer for the
Benham-Holway Power Group, Tulsa, designer of the project. Geotechnical
input is by the Denver office of Woodward-Clyde Consultants.
   ``We believe it is the highest exposed concrete slurry wall ever built
in the world,'' says Kenneth D. Hansen, senior water resource engineer in
Englewood, Colo., for the Portland Cement Association. ``It shows how high
a slurry wall can go if you use the right design.''
When the Army Corps of Engineers built navigation and recreation Dam No. 2
on the lower Arkansas River in the 1960s, it diverted the flow to a new
channel. So when the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp., Little Rock,
decided to install a $192-million 108-Mw powerhouse at the dam near Nady,
Ark., it had only the narrow strip of land to work with. The three-unit,
low-head power station will be founded 100 ft below grade in a highly
plastic clay layer, Sheth says.
   Designers first considered using roller-compacted concrete gravity
sections for the walls, but decided slippage on the clay base would cause
too many problems. Instead, they specified a perimeter slurry trench cutoff
wall to permit dewatering, with the thick structural slurry walls placed
within it.
   French contractor Soletanche Inc. used two machines with rotating cutter
heads to dig down into the clay layer for the cutoff wall around the entire
site. It totals 584,000 sq ft of plasticized concrete, which reached a
compressive strength of 200 psi in seven days. That work helped Soletanche
formulate a mix for the main slurry trench walls, which had to achieve
4,000-psi strength in 28 days.
   The 258,000 sq ft of structural walls consist of 152 panels as thick as
3 ft, says Sheth. More than half of them are T-shaped to provide better
anchorage in the soil. The larger panels will be structurally integrated
with the powerhouse side walls. They are connected by a cap beam and tied
to a deadman wall set back 113 ft using 132 tendon anchors with tensile
strengths ranging up to 1.8-million lb. Smaller panels are tied back by 302
ground anchors with 600,000-lb tensile strength. They will be removed after
construction.
   Hansen calls the safety features--dewatering to ease hydrostatic
pressure and the complex anchoring system-- ``fairly daring.''
Record rebar. Soletanche worked around the clock for four months to dig the
trenches. It had rebar cages assembled that weigh as much as 70 tons and
are as long as 130 ft. Sheth calls that a record. A three-crane array
lowered them into the trenches. In total, 3,500 tons of rebar were
fabricated and placed during a three-month period.
   Slurry walls have been completed and excavation of 3 million cu yd of
soil is under way. J.A. Jones Construction Co., Charlotte, N.C., will begin
building the powerhouse early this year. Once the new channel and
generating station are in place, equalizing hydrostatic pressure, the
perimeter cutoff wall will be removed.
   The design also had to account for possible heaving and settling of the
clay base layer in a range of 3 to 4 in. during excavation and powerhouse
construction, says Sheth. The builders have installed a sophisticated
monitoring system to track the impact of those movements on the walls.

ISOLATORS PASS TEST OF TIME

By:
David B. Rosenbaum


   Ever since the 1985 completion of the nation's first base-isolated
building, there have been lingering doubts about the long-term stability of
the high-damping rubber used. Newly disclosed test results encourage
confidence in its performance. But questions remain about the ability of
isolators in general to hold up under near-field effects and so-called
seismic fling--the large displacement pulses in a major quake's initial
seconds.
   The first U.S. installation at the Foothill Communities Law and Justice
Center in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., was the largest for its time. The
170,000-sq-ft building owned by San Bernardino County has five stories
sitting on 98 isolators; a 16-in. gap separates the below-grade first story
from the exterior retaining wall. That gap permits the isolators to shear
horizontally 16 in. Installed beneath columns, they have horizontal layers
of steel and high-damping rubber, and are 30 in. in diameter and 18 in.
tall.
   Last August, workers jacked up the building for $20,000, removed two
isolators and temporarily replaced them with the original prototypes
tested in 1983 (ENR 9/11/95 p. 24). James M. Kelly, the structural
engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley who
supervised the original prototype testing, oversaw the recent testing of
the production isolators as well. ``There's always been a lot of questions
about the mechanical characteristics of rubbers,'' he notes.
   Testing of the two production isolators took place last fall at the same
place where they were manufactured, a factory now run by Furon Structural
Bearings in Athens, Texas. ``I tried to make everything exactly what it was
before,'' Kelly says. ``The tests demonstrated that the material has
long-term stability and doesn't change its mechanical characteristics over
time and doesn't change under load.'' Kenneth A. Taylor, San Bernardino
County's project manager, says, ``That was something that had not really
been known up until this time.''
   Still questionable. Base isolators have been installed under more than
20 buildings in the U.S. and about 100 in Japan, as well as in Italy and
New Zealand. The cost premium--if any--depends on the comparisons; isolated
structures generally cost more but perform better than conventional
construction. Compared to conventional construction, base isolation
generally costs 3 to 6% more, Kelly figures, but ``turns out to be
cheaper'' for meeting equivalent performance standards.
   But performance remains uncertain. The largest quake yet to affect a
base-isolated structure--the relatively moderate 6.9 quake devastating
Kobe, Japan, last year--struck about 15 miles from the closest isolated
building.
   San Bernardino County's justice center is designed for 0.7 g of ground
acceleration, but has not experienced more than 0.3 g, points out Hodge C.
Gaines, president of Taylor and Gaines, Pasadena.
   It engineered the building before the 1991 introduction of provisions
for isolation in the Uniform Building Code. Based on geotechnical studies,
T&G designed isolators to shear a maximum of 16 in. for major quakes on the
San Andreas fault 131/2 miles away and the Sierra Madre fault zone less
than 2 miles away.
   It remains debatable whether that 16 in. suffices. One of the most vocal
critics of current base-isolation methods is John Hall, a civil engineering
professor at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. In its
Engineering & Science magazine last summer, he wrote, ``the near-source
motions being used in the design of base-isolated buildings could be too
small, and the resulting buildings may not, in fact, be
`earthquake-proof.'''
Kelly intends to issue a paper in response soon. And early this year he
intends to publish the results of his recent isolator tests.

LIGHT TRAFFIC CHILLS DULLES DEBUT

By:
By Tom Ichniowski


When Transportation Secretary Federico Pea helped open the Dulles Greenway
Sept. 29, he presented a horseshoe to the private road's chief executive,
Michael R. Crane. Crane will need much good fortune, and a lot more riders,
if his $330-million project is to succeed. The Greenway so far has drawn a
disappointing average of 10,500 daily travelers, well short of the 34,000
its owners projected by the end of the first year of the road's operation.
   The project's slow start has already raised questions about the future
of private toll roads just as another opens to traffic. The $126-million
State Route 91, ten miles of toll lanes built into the middle of an
existing freeway in Orange County, Calif., opened Dec. 27. Officials there
will not disclose how many drivers are using the new lanes.
   The Dulles Greenway's difficulties are being studied as examples of
mistakes to avoid, even by those who believe the Greenway will eventually
reach its projected volume. In particular, toll road and transportation
officials believe the Greenway has been hindered by its lack of a marketing
study, consumer-oriented advertising and peak and off-peak pricing.
   Consumers. ``We have to understand these projects are a consumer product
and we have to have research and marketing,'' says Adeel Lari, director of
Minnesota's Dept. of Transportation's Alternative Transportation Financing
program. ``The lack of marketing may make it start slower.'' Crane says he
is discussing volume discounts for local employers, peak and off-peak
pricing, and strong marketing to draw more patrons.
   The Greenway charges a flat $1.75 toll all day. State Route 91 in
California uses peak pricing. The toll is as low as 25 cents in the
off-peak 7 p.m. to 4 a.m period and as high as $2.50 in the 5 a.m. to 9
a.m. rush hour.
   So far, traffic on the new lanes of State Route 91 is ``light,''
according to a spokesman for Granite Construction Co., Watsonville, Calif.,
a partner in the venture. The spokesman attributes the light traffic to the
holidays.
   Pricing is seen as a problem for the Dulles Greenway, where drivers have
resisted paying even though they get a brand-new traffic-free road. ``I do
think developers will have to be very sensitive to the price that travelers
are willing to pay for convenience,'' says one federal transportation
official.
   ``I think everybody was expecting perhaps a faster buildup,'' says
Mortimer L. Downey, deputy secretary of the U.S. Dept. of Transportation.
Downey says the project's traffic will exceed ``their break-even point''
after some time has passed and drivers test it out.
   Crane concedes that the results have been disappointing. But he still
thinks he can hit the traffic target by next fall. The project's primary
lenders ``were very supportive of the project and felt very strongly
traffic could achieve the end-year numbers.'' He says he doesn't foresee a
foreclosure, but he won't rule out refinancing, either.
   Crane's family owns 57% of the partnership that controls the toll road.
It stands to gain or lose the most. Crane's mother, Magalen O. Bryant, and
her family-owned investment company, Lochnau Ltd., gradually increased an
initial investment of $15 million to $68 million as the project team
struggled to find lenders and other investors through 1993. The project's
institutional lenders are led by CIGNA Investments, Prudential and John
Hancock. The project's financing closed and construction began in September
1993. At that time Crane said that he was looking to sell off a substantial
portion of Lochnau's interest.
   The 14-mile-long project extends an existing toll road and connects
Washington Dulles International Airport with Leesburg, Va. Existing roads
already are congested. Traffic projections were prepared by Vollmer
Associates, New York City-based engineering consultant. Company officials
could not be reached for comment on the toll road's slow start.
   ``The traffic has been lower than anticipated, but [that's] not unusual
for a toll road startup,'' says Barbara Johnson, spokeswoman for Brown &
Root, Houston, the prime contractor and 13% owner of the Greenway. ``We are
seeing signs of slow improvement.'' After the Crane family's 57%,
Autostrade SPA of Italy holds the biggest stake.
   Brown & Root, the prime contractor, finished its portion of the work six
months early with no overruns, says Johnson. But the automatic vehicle
identification system is not yet in place. Crane expected the technology to
be ready by first quarter of this year, but now says he's not sure it will
be done by then. He cites ``problems with state procurement.''
   Crane says he would invest in other toll roads and has formed a firm to
advise on other jobs. But he has learned lessons. ``I would never do it the
same way. I would never do it as a totally private toll road. I would do it
as a public-private venture,'' with a state or Uncle Sam as partner or
guarantor.

SEATTLE MULLS PRIVATIZATION

By:
By Stephen Daniels, with Debra K. Rubin


The City of Seattle's planned construction of a 120-million-gal-per-day
drinking water filtration plant, the first phase of a $1.2-billion, 10-year
capital improvement plan, is likely to be watched closely by other U.S.
cities. The plant could become the largest design-build-operate drinking
water facility on the American mainland.
   Proposals are due this week for a consultant to help the city develop a
request for proposals for a DBO contractor for the Tolt Filtration Plant,
to be located on the Tolt River's south fork. The river provides about 30%
of drinking water for the central Puget Sound region. The plant, the
largest project undertaken to date by Seattle's Water Dept., would cost $93
million to $103 million under a traditional design-build approach. The city
expects to save between 10 and 15% of estimated construction costs using
DBO. A 20-year operating contract would cost an additional $60 million,
says Michael Schaefer, the city's capital improvement program analyst.
   Seattle is one of six major U.S. cities now using unfiltered rivers as
primary drinking water sources. It is turning to filtration to comply with
more stringent federal drinking water regulations. The proposed plant, and
another on the other major supply source--the Cedar River--also would
improve reliability of Seattle's drinking water system. Recent heavy rains
cut off the Cedar River supply because of storm-caused sedimentation.
   The project is already sparking interest among firms eager to push
privatization in the U.S. ``There have been a lot of smaller projects, but
nothing of this scale,'' says Jimmy W. Otta, vice president of CH2M Hill
Cos., which has a joint contract with Montgomery Watson, Pasadena, Calif.,
for the plant's predesign. ``A lot of people have been waiting for this
kind of project. There will be a lot of competition.''
   In October, Puerto Rico awarded a $300-million DBO contract for a new
filtration plant and 50-mile pipeline to a consortium of the London-based
Thames Water International, Dick Corp., Pittsburgh, and Malcolm Pirnie
Inc., White Plains, N.Y. It is set to take effect by month's end, says a
Pirnie official.
   While Seattle is ``still not absolutely committed to DBO,'' says one
contractor executive, the winner of the $800,000 RFP preparation contract
will assist municipal officials in comparing costs of privatized and
traditional approaches for the filtration plant. A DBO contract could be
awarded in early 1997 with the facility targeted for completion by 2001.
``The market is telling us it's ready,'' says Schaefer. ``It will be
challenging to see if this works within the U.S.''
   Seattle hopes to create design and operating efficiencies by creating
consortiums that will bring designers, builders and equipment manufacturers
together early in the design process. ``We have been told by firms
interested in bringing this model to the U.S. that this could well be the
first of many such projects in the U.S. and that they may forego immediate
profits on this job in order to create a market niche,'' says Schaefer.
   ``The interesting thing here is the operations component. There aren't a
lot of firms in the world with the capability to operate a plant like
this'' says Otta. ``We are seeing a lot of people who never talked to one
another before forging partnerships and alliances.''

BUDGET MESS STALLS OTHER BILLS

By:
By Tom Ichniowski and Sherie Winston

Several major construction bills are on the slow track as Congress awaits
the outcome of high-level budget negotiations.
   As the 104th Congress moves into its second session this month, there is
no progress on any legislation, says Dana Thompson, Sheet Metal and Air
Conditioning Contractors National Association director of political
affairs. ``Everything is sitting tight'' until the budget crisis is
resolved, Thompson says.
   The House has passed a rewrite of the Clean Water Act, including a new
system for categorizing wetlands. Those wanting to dredge wetlands judged
most valuable would have to avoid, minimize or mitigate damage. But the
Senate had just begun hearings on its version as 1995 ended.
   The picture was nearly reversed on the Safe Drinking Water Act. The
Senate cleared its reauthorization bill, with provision for a new state
revolving fund. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee leaders
introduced an SRF bill. But the House Commerce Committee, which has prime
jurisdiction over drinking water, did not produce a bill with regulatory
provisions.
   If the final budget reconciliation measure extends Superfund taxes, that
would remove what steam is left in reauthorization proposals, at least for
now. The big sticking point with those proposals is the high cost of
eliminating pollution liability retroactively.

STATES SEEKING TRANSPORT BANKS

By:
By Tom Ichniowski and Sherie Winston

The Dept. of Transportation is seeking applicants for newly authorized
state infrastructure banks. The National Highway System Designation Act
permits up to 10 state or multi-state banks. In the Dec. 28 Federal
Register, DOT says it will take applications until 10 banks are approved.
None will be designated before Jan. 29.
   ``There are several states that are quite interested,'' says Deputy DOT
Secretary Mortimer L. Downey. ``The one thing that tends to put them off a
bit is they say: `Where's the new money.'' He adds, ``We say, `No, no,
there isn't any new money. This is a way to try to make your money go
further.''
   Downey says states will have to reprogram other exist-
ing aid to launch the banks. ``There are some who definitely want to do
that,'' he says. Among those DOT is talking to are Ohio, California, and
Florida.
   Banks can use federal aid for infrastructure loans, interest-rate
subsidies, reserves for bond or debt financing, or in other ways to stretch
the money.

INJURY RATE FALLS FOR CONSTRUCTION

By:
By Tom Ichniowski and Sherie Winston

Construction has recorded its lowest injury rate in 20 years and for the
first time the industry's injury rate dipped below the level for 
manufacturing. That good news came in a Bureau of Labor Statistics report
covering 1994 data.
   But Bradley Sant, director of safety and health for the AFL-CIO Building
and Construction Trades Dept., says proposed safety standards shouldn't be
moved to the back burner. Sant says the construction injury rate remains
high. He argues it is important to move forward with a revised standard for
scaffolding as well as a new permit-required confined space standard.
   The BLS annual survey on Workplace Injuries and Illnesses, released last
month, reports there were 11.8 incidences of injury and illness for every
100 full-time workers in construction. That compares with a 12.2 rate in
manufacturing. The construction data are a vast improvement from 1974 when
the rate was 18.3.

ABC PUSHING FOR ANTI-SALTING BILL

By:
By Tom Ichniowski and Sherie Winston

Determined to counter a recent Supreme Court decision that gives the green
light to ``salting'' practices, the Associated Builders and Contractors is
working with members of the House and Senate labor panels to write
legislation to prohibit the practice. But any such bill is sure to face
vigorous opposition from labor unions.
   ``We're still under active negotiation'' to draft a bill, says Charles
Hawkins, ABC senior vice president. Negotiators are being careful only to
address salting and not reopen the National Labor Relations Act, Hawkins
says.
   One possibility would be to change the NLRA definition of ``employee.''
Hawkins says, ``Our timing [for a bill to be introduced] is within four to
six weeks.''

THE TOP 25 NEWSMAKERS OF 1995

Many people in many ways serve the best interests of the construction
industry. The editors of ENR have chosen these 25 for newsmaking
achievements covered in the magazine last year. All of those cited on this
page and the next will be honored at a Feb. 15 dinner at the Plaza Hotel in
New York City. One of them has already been chosen to receive the Award of
Excellence, ENR's top honor. That person will be the subject of a cover
story in the Feb. 19 issue.
   Working in the nightmarish aftermath of April's terrorist bombing in
Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people, structural engineer David J.
Hammond of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Jerry Ennis of Oscar
J. Boldt Construction Co. led a heroic effort to stabilize the teetering
remains of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Their tireless
work kept the remnants of the reinforced concrete office building, its guts
ripped open and major sections dangling precariously, standing for more
than a month so that rescuers could search for survivors, and crime scene
investigators for clues.
   As leader of a research team that perfected an extrusion process,
Surendrah Shah, professor of civil engineering at Northwestern University,
developed a low-cost manufacturing process for creating high-strength,
bendable cement-composite building products. The process uses machinery
that can produce sheets, pipes, rods and structural shapes but costs 75%
less than existing machines that can only make sheets.
   Proving that an engineering firm with fewer than 30 people can push the
envelope, Myers Nelson Houghton Inc.'s David L. Houghton and his team
devised a joint that resists the kind of cracking in steel moment-resisting
frames (SMRFs) triggered by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Calling for
side plates with fillet welds, the patented connection is the first
post-quake SMRF joint to meet requirements of California's stringent
oversight agency for hospital construction.
   For an 18,000-sq-ft library with an exposed wooden truss system,
architect Eliot W. Goldstein set a new standard for heavy timber structure
as architecture. Facing skyrocketing lumber prices, he reworked the design
to transform the two-dimensional frame into a more efficient
three-dimensional structure, akin to a timber space frame. In doing so,
Goldstein sliced 35 tons of lumber from the $4-million building and added
more visual interest. He also produced an instant landmark for New Jersey's
Montville Township.
   Improving on a technique used mostly in Europe, Stephen Blaisdell of
Cianbro Corp. and construction engineer Craig Finley of Finley McNary
Engineers Inc. suspended formwork on prestressed tendons to cast, without
falsework, arch ribs over the Presumpscot River in Maine. Cianbro was able
to cast the spandrel piers while constructing the arches. The method cut
cost and schedule from critical in-river work.
   Gamil Tadros, formerly with Stanley Technology Group, and Gerard
Sauvageot of J. Muller International developed and refined precast
components weighing up to 54,000 tonnes for 44 gravity-base piers on
Canada's Northumberland Strait Crossing. The piers minimize marine work on
the 12.9-kilometer bridge and enable the contractor to set long girders to
tight tolerances on elevations and alignment.
   New York City engineer Shawn Disney developed an innovative plastic pier
that simultaneously solves two pressing environmental
problems--deteriorating wharves and mounting garbage. The 410-ft-long pier
has piles, beams and decking made entirely of recycled plastic, which is
impervious to marine borers. Disney's solution offered a sound and durable
alternative to wood and recycled the equivalent of 13 million milk
containers.
   L.T. Huynh of DORIS Development Canada Ltd. headed the team that
designed the first large concrete gravity-base offshore structure built in
North America. The monumental base is surrounded by an innovative ice wall
to protect the Hibernia oil production platform from North Atlantic
icebergs. Robert Elliott, civil construction manager for Norwegian
Contractors Newfoundland Inc./Peter Kiewit Sons Co. Ltd., successfully
slipformed the complex shapes.
   Steel erector Larry W. Davis, formerly of Canron Construction Corp.,
ultimately proved correct an audacious strategy to construct a platform for
a 12-story addition to New York Hospital spanning Manhattan's busy FDR
Drive. Davis developed a scheme and a special rig to lift prefabricated
truss platform sections weighing as much as 830 tons each from Hudson River
barges to the hemmed-in site. Platforms were placed with pinpoint accuracy
despite rough waters and freezing temperatures.
   Anthony Scardino, executive director of the Hackensack Meadowlands
Development Commission, led development of a unique land use strategy for
the New Jersey Meadowlands to permit development in the neglected but
economically strategic 32-sq-mile area without sacrificing fragile
wetlands. The effort will spur new construction and create a $1-billion,
developer-financed fund for pollution cleanup and marsh restoration in this
last large urban estuary. The plan also involves a unique collaboration of
normally fractious environmental regulators.
   Robert F. Oury, president of Rotec Industries, developed a system to
deliver concrete directly from batchplants to monolith pours at Mexico's
Huites Dam. The material traveled as far as 400 meters in 90 seconds,
saving money and allowing swift completion of the job.
   John D. Clarkson, chief structural engineer with the Army Corps of
Engineers' Huntington, W. Va., district, revolutionized navigation lock
design with a concept that, by halving costs on one project, will save $200
million. The design places water intake culverts in the floor of a lock
rather than in walls, vastly reducing the amount of structural concrete
required. It promises to become the new standard for locks.
   Alcoa's $200-million cleanup of a plant site in Massena, N.Y., has
become a model for the private sector, thanks largely to Boyd Braniff, the
firm's environmental remediation manager. One of the largest private,
single-company cleanup projects in the country, the effort covers 17
separate waste sites, 37 acres of landfills and 110 acres of contaminated
lagoons. Braniff's approach to the project stresses innovative performance
incentives and unusually strong levels of communication among contractors
and regulators.
   Armed with design strategies to fight fear and crime, Sarasota Chief
Planner Sherry Plaster Carter teamed up with the police department to
reclaim seedier sections of the Florida city from muggers, drug dealers and
prostitutes. Her crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED)
program, already a model for other cities, ensures that all Sarasota
projects are planned with an emphasis on public safety through the built
environment, a powerful yet low-cost tool. In Carter's pilot CPTED
sector--the once-troubled North Tamiami Trail area--crime has dropped 29%
since 1990 and investment is soaring.
   Fluor-Daniel project director Ed Kirkley orchestrated a fast-track
design and construction effort that put a $200-million Georgia carpet plant
into operation 181 days after it was leveled by fire. Partnering and
teambuilding helped slash a two-year rebuilding schedule.
   Mercury Productions Inc.'s Jonathan Antevy and FMI Corp.'s Hoyt G.
Lowder were the first to move practical construction applications onto the
World Wide Web via their joint venture, the Global Construction Network.
They developed software that enabled web sites, created for individual
construction projects, to be used for partnering, real-time communication,
information exchange, scheduling and cost control.
   Chairman Frank T. MacInnis and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey M. Levy
rescued JWP Inc. from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. They refocused the nation's
largest subcontractor, now known as EMCOR Group Inc., on its core business
of electrical and mechanical construction without jeopardizing ongoing work
of construction subsidiaries.
   Drawing on 40 years of experience in hydrology, Wisconsin engineer Paul
Johnson designed an earthen dam and irrigation system for 4,000 citizens of
Itbayat, an island in the Philippines. With no knowledge of hydraulic
engineering, the people were dependent on one commercial crop, garlic,
which no longer is profitable. Working with relief agencies, Johnson's
efforts, performed for free and on his own time, gave islanders a chance at
economic self-sustainability through growing a wider variety of crops.
   M.J. Nigel Priestley, a structural engineering professor at the
University of California at San Diego, successfully introduced to the U.S.
a cost-saving method of seismic-resistant design called
displacement-ductility capacity analysis for reinforced concrete
structures. Devised in New Zealand, it is used for designing structural
components of elevated freeways. The method can shave up to 15% off the
cost of new construction and more than 30% on retrofits. Unlike standard
force-based procedures, it permits determining whether bridge details in
fact furnish sufficient deformation capacity.

NEWS BRIEFS

By Catholic News Service
                              U.S.
PRO-LIFE GROUP LAUDS AMA SHIFT ON ANENCEPHALIC BABIES
   STAFFORD, Va. (CNS) -- The American Life League has praised an
American Medical Association panel's suspension of a 1994 policy
statement that said doctors could harvest the organs of newborn
anencephalic babies before they died. ``I would like to commend
the American Medical Association for taking a step back into the
real world where human rights are acknowledged as belonging to all
human beings, regardless of age, state or condition of
development,'' league president Judie Brown said Dec. 28.
Anencephalic children are born with a brain stem but with no upper
brain, skull or scalp. Most die within a few days of birth,
although some have lived for months or even years. From 1988 to
1994 the AMA position was that retrieval and transplantation of
organs from anencephalic newborns was ethically permissible only
after a determination of death ``in accordance with accepted
medical standards and relevant law.''

CLOSING PARISH GIVES $400,000 TO CATHOLIC SCHOOLS
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (CNS) -- Many Catholics grieved and some
protested when Archbishop Thomas C. Kelly of Louisville announced
the closing of eight parishes in November. Members of six other
parishes originally slated to close or merge celebrated the fact
that they were to remain open as independent parishes. But one of
the closing parishes responded to the news by setting up two
$200,000 endowment funds for nearby Catholic schools. At St.
Columba, a parish of about 100 households in a working-class
neighborhood in Louisville, the pastor, Father John Caskey, and the
parish finance committee decided to use the parish's reserve funds
to help support Catholic education in the area. They gave
endowments of $200,000 each to Community Catholic (elementary)
School and Holy Cross High School, the only two Catholic schools
in the western part of Jefferson County.

BISHOP SAYS CARDINAL BROUGHT IRA PEACE PLAN TO BRITAIN IN '70s
   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (CNS) -- Retired Bishop Edward
K. Daly said an Irish cardinal acted as a go-between, passing peace
proposals from top IRA leaders to then-British Prime Minister
Harold Wilson during the 1974-75 cease-fire in Northern Ireland.
According to advance information on a documentary film scheduled
for release on Irish television Jan. 4, Bishop Daly said he and two
other bishops who met with the IRA men asked the late Cardinal
William Conway of Armagh to carry the peace plans to Wilson. The
IRA group appeared to include the organization's entire command,
Bishop Daly said. The other bishops attending the meeting were from
the Irish Republic, he said. Their names were not mentioned, nor
was the meeting site or exact date of the meeting.

INDONESIAN PARISHIONERS KILL PROTESTANT MAN WHO TOOK COMMUNION
   ATAMBUA, Indonesia (CNS) -- Parishioners at Immaculate
Conception Cathedral in Atambua beat a Protestant man to death
after he allegedly received Communion during a cathedral service.
Reports said that a group of churchgoers seized Hendrik Letto,
after he received a consecrated host at the cathedral Nov. 26, UCA
News, an Asian church news agency based in Thailand, reported Dec.
29. According to reports, other parishioners then took him outside
and beat him to death in front of the cathedral. An unconfirmed
report from Letto's home village, about 70 miles south of Atambua,
said that Letto had been studying Catholicism because he wanted to
convert. In Kupang, capital of East Nusa Tenggara province,
government officials expressed concern over the killing.

CHURCH AIDING VICTIMS OF SOUTH AFRICAN FLOODS
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (CNS) -- A church in Pietermaritzburg
will coordinate the Catholic part of a joint relief effort for
victims of flash floods in Kwazulu-Natal, which left more than 120
people dead after heavy rains caused rivers to overflow on
Christmas Day. ``The damage is devastating,'' Archbishop Wilfrid
Napier of Durban said in a telephone interview with Catholic News
Service after visiting affected areas Dec. 27. ``Streams have been
turned into rivers and there are huge tree trunks lying across
roads,'' he said. The bishop said St. Mary's Church in central
Pietermaritzburg will coordinate the church's relief program. More
than 2,000 people have been left homeless by the floods.

ELECTRONIC VISITORS CROWD VATICAN INTERNET SITE
   VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- The Vatican's new Internet site was
swamped with online traffic over the Christmas holidays, leaving
church officials amazed and pleased. More than 300,000 people from
70 countries logged into the site on the World Wide Web in the 48
hours after its inauguration Dec. 25, Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro-Valls said. At its peak, the user rate was more than 20,000
people per hour. Nearly 1,000 of the electronic visitors left
messages. They ranged from theological observations to suggestions
for flu remedies for Pope John Paul II. The Vatican opened its
Internet ``home page'' by offering the pontiff's Christmas message
and greetings in more than 50 languages.

                             PEOPLE
CATHOLIC JOURNALIST GETS FIRSTHAND LOOK AT HOMELESSNESS IN PHILLY
   PHILADELPHIA (CNS) -- A Catholic journalist who spent a week
living with the homeless of Philadelphia found that it's not always
easy to find a place to sleep or to figure out when to go where for
a meal. Lou Baldwin, a reporter for The Catholic Standard and Times
in Philadelphia, described his experiences in a lengthy article in
the archdiocesan newspaper in December. During the last week of
September, Baldwin packed a knapsack full of clothing, a few hard
rolls and a bottle of water, carried handwritten identification as
``Martin D. Palmer'' and put a few dollars in change into his
pocket to call his wife each day. He left home his eyeglasses and
credit cards, but wrapped $10 and a photocopy of his real
identification under the inner sole of his sneaker. Why did he do
it? ``Many times I have been called upon to write about the problem
of homelessness and what is being done to help the homeless,'' he
wrote. ``This was simply a way to get a true feel for the story
from the point of view of those who are affected most, not
administrators or social workers, but homeless people themselves.''

PREACH (from ST. LOUIS)
DOMINICANS MOVE SUMMER PREACHING INSTITUTE TO CHICAGO AREA

By Catholic News Service
   ST. LOUIS (CNS) -- The Aquinas Institute of Theology will move
its annual Aquinas Summer Preaching Institute from St. Louis to the
Chicago area in 1996.
   The new home of the two-week program, held in St. Louis since
1986, will be the Dominican Conference Center in River Forest, Ill.
   Dominican Sister Diane Kennedy, academic dean, said the new
location will make the institute's preaching resources available
to the Archdiocese of Chicago and surrounding dioceses.
   ``Cardinal (Joseph L.) Bernardin's strategic plan for the
archdiocese emphasizes the importance of good preaching and has
specific provisions for improving preaching,'' she noted. ``We are
eager to participate with the Chicago Office of Worship in that
effort.''
   The Dominicans began the summer institute as a way of sharing
their preaching charism with the church at large. Participants may
take the entire program or selected courses.
   The 1996 summer institute is scheduled for June 23-July 5.
Morning lectures will feature Dominican Sister Marygrace Peters on
``History and Preaching,'' and Dominican Sister Carla Mae Streeter
and Dominican Father Jude Siciliano on ``The Spirituality of the
Preacher.'' Afternoon sessions will focus on building homily skills
and evaluating student preaching.
   The Aquinas Institute is a Dominican graduate school of
theology and ministry for religious, laity and clergy. Its students
represent a variety of faith traditions.

POPE-YEAR (from VATICAN CITY)
POPE PRAYS FOR PEACE, JUSTICE -- ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN
By Cindy Wooden

With photos to come.
Catholic News Service
   VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- Thanking God for the blessings of 1995
and marking the beginning of 1996, Pope John Paul II prayed for
peace and justice throughout the world, especially for children.
   Recovered from his Christmas bout with the flu, the pope led
the midday Angelus prayer Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 with visitors in St.
Peter's Square, led an evening prayer service of thanksgiving at
a Rome church New Year's Eve and celebrated Mass New Year's Day in
St. Peter's Basilica.
   Christians celebrate the New Year still focused on the birth
of Christ and the salvation he brings to all humanity, the pope
said during the Jan. 1 Mass.
   Marking the feast of Mary, Mother of God, and World Peace Day
at the Mass, the pope said the fact that God became human means
that human history has a divine order to it.
   ``Peace,'' he said, is a ``fundamental sign of divine
presence.''
   The pope said peace should be evident not only in individual
lives; ``it must also radiate throughout the political order and
in the life of communities and nations.''
   The name Jesus, which means ``God saves,'' holds the promise
of salvation from every evil, ``particularly from hatred, war and
destruction,'' the pope said.
   Pope John Paul chose as the theme of his 1996 World Peace Day
message, ``Let us give children a future of peace.''
   ``The children of the earth, at the end of this century, are
the seeds of the third millennium: For their tomorrow they ask for
works of peace and the inheritance of a united world marked by
solidarity,'' the pope said at the Angelus after Mass.
   ``The little ones embody the hopes, expectations and potential
of the human community,'' he said. ``They are witnesses and masters
of hope, a sentiment they live with a joyful enthusiasm.''
   ``Do not extinguish the hope in their hearts; do not suffocate
their expectations of peace!'' Pope John Paul said.
   ``It is truly important that we adults think of them and assure
children of a peaceful future,'' he said. ``It is our task and our
responsibility.''
   Reciting the Angelus the day before, the feast of the Holy
Family, the pope said that a natural part of parenthood is working
to avoid all that is bad for one's family and to guarantee every
possible good for one's children.
   But today's families, he said, which by their nature should be
centers of life and love, often are exposed to ``painful threats
of every kind.''
   Christian families are called to look to the Holy Family for
answers, he said. The relationship among Jesus, Mary and Joseph
was one of ``authentic love and charity, creating not only an
eloquent model for all families, but also offering a guarantee that
a similar love can be realized in every nuclear family.''
   Pope John Paul prayed that ``faith would grow in every house
and that in each home love, agreement, solidarity, mutual respect
and openness to life would reign.''
   The mayor of Rome and Italian political leaders joined the pope
Dec. 31 at Rome's St. Ignatius Church for an evening prayer service
of thanksgiving for the past year.
   The pope told the congregation that Italy, with a population
more than 95 percent Catholic, needs renewed evangelization ``so
that the cultural and social currents running toward a radical
secularization do not diminish the vigor of the faith held by the
majority of the population.''
   A state with clearly established laws, democracy and a
well-ordered economy ``cannot prosper without reference to that
which is owed man because he is man, that is to principles of truth
and objective moral criteria,'' the pope said.
   Moral relativism is an ``insidious enemy'' of democracy, not
its natural result, he said.
   ``One must work with courage so that social structures are
respectful of those ethical values that express the full truth
about humanity,'' the pope said.

WEEKLY ROUNDUP (from VATICAN CITY)
SPECULATION ON PAPAL HEALTH LASTS LONGER THAN POPE'S FLU
By John Thavis

With photos sent Dec. 27 and to come.
Catholic News Service
   VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- Pope John Paul II's Christmas bout with
the flu was over in about 24 hours, but it reverberated much longer
in the world's press, on the Internet and in the prayers of the
faithful.
   Sick with an upset stomach and a light fever, the 75-year-old
pope canceled his participation at Christmas morning Mass in St.
Peter's Basilica for the first time since his election in 1978.
   When he tried to pronounce the traditional blessing and message
for a worldwide TV audience later in the day, he was visibly shaken
by an attack of nausea and had to walk away from his apartment
window. He reappeared 20 minutes later to explain briefly that even
the pope gets sick.
   Vatican officials said the pope was feeling much better the
next day, and by the end of the week he was walking in the central
Italian mountains. But once again papal health had become an issue
in the world forum.
   During Pope John Paul's 17-year pontificate, his medical
travails have brought a new era of public disclosure at the
Vatican. From his assassination attempt in 1981 to his
hospitalization for falls and intestinal surgery in the early '90s,
the world has been able to follow his recoveries in daily medical
bulletins that have spared no details.
   That's a revolutionary concept for the Vatican, which for
centuries considered papal health a state secret. Popes were always
in good health until the day they died; if they needed an operation
-- like Pope Paul VI did for prostate problems -- they had it
inside the Vatican.
   But what if the pope's illness does not require
hospitalization? For the pope's flu, the press office statements
were reassuring but lacked the completeness of full medical
reports.
   Off-the-record, more detailed explanations were offered for the
pontiff's fever and nausea: He stayed up too late for midnight Mass
the night before, he caught a chill after sweating in St. Peter's
Basilica under heavy vestments, he was feeling the cumulative
effects of a very heavy schedule in 1995, or he caught a virus
going around Italy.
   Rome's Polish community was convinced it was something he ate,
though no one seemed to want to pronounce the words ``food
poisoning.''
   Whatever the precise cause, the pope could not have chosen a
more public place to feel sick, and the feedback was instant. The
press was alarmed; the faithful were sympathetic.
   He led the news around the world on Christmas, and the next
day's papers were full of dire headlines. Several quoted the pope
as saying, ``I cannot go on,'' a bit more dramatic than what he
actually said in Italian: ``Excuse me, I have to interrupt.''
Frame-by-frame photos of the pope feeling progressively lousier at
his apartment window were widely published.
   Meanwhile, the Vatican switchboard was jammed with callers
wondering about the state of the pontiff. But that was nothing
compared to the traffic at the Vatican's new Internet site.
   Inaugurated Christmas day, the Internet ``home page'' welcomed
online visitors with illustrated texts of the papal Christmas
message and greetings in more than 50 languages. It also offered
an e-mail box for messages, and several hundred people left them
-- many giving advice to the ailing pope.
   One U.S. girl named Sarah, for example, told him he should take
her father's remedy: Drink chicken broth and plenty of other
liquids. Get some rest and don't worry, she added. Others offered
prayers for the pope. The response delighted Vatican officials, who
said they were copying many of the messages for the pope's perusal.
   By Dec. 26, when the pope appeared for another blessing, the
alarm about his health had largely subsided at the Vatican. He left
the next day by helicopter for his summer villa outside Rome,
looking a bit wan but obviously feeling better.
   The global reaction, however, was still echoing. French Bishop
Jacques Gaillot, a controversial figure who had met with the pope
a few days before to discuss his ambiguous role in the church, said
that, in retrospect, he found the pontiff fatigued and looking
swollen in the face.
   Others wondered whether he would be up to another year of
global traveling: He had scheduled trips to Latin America in
February, and later to France, Germany, Hungary and Slovenia.
   As the questions lingered, the pope did not. According to
Vatican sources, he walked for three hours on central Italy's
tallest mountain Dec. 29. Witnesses quoted by Italian newspapers
said the papal entourage built a big fire and had grilled steaks,
cooked peaches and Barbera wine.
   Like all the pope's previous mountain excursions, this one was
considered ``private'' by the Vatican press office, which would not
officially confirm or deny the reports. But no one at the Vatican
was unhappy to see headlines the next day about the ``mountain
man'' pope back in form.

BISHOPS-RETIRE (from WASHINGTON)
TWELVE U.S. BISHOPS COULD RETIRE FOR AGE REASONS THIS YEAR
By Jerry Filteau

Catholic News Service
   WASHINGTON (CNS) -- There are 12 currently active U.S. bishops
who could retire for reasons of age in 1996.
   Six of them -- including two cardinals -- turned 75 last year
but Pope John Paul II has not yet accepted their resignations.
   Six other U.S. bishops will turn 75 within the next 12 months.
   The most prominent of the U.S. prelates who had their 75th
birthday last year are Cardinals John J. O'Connor of New York and
James A. Hickey of Washington. The pope has asked both to stay on
past the usual retirement age.
   Cardinal Hickey has been a priest since 1946, a bishop since
1967, archbishop of Washington since 1980 and a cardinal since
1988. He was born Oct. 11, 1920.
   Cardinal O'Connor has been a priest since 1945, a bishop since
1979, archbishop of New York since 1984 and a cardinal since 1985.
He was born Jan. 15, 1920.
   Two bishops who turned 75 last year are now the last remaining
active bishops in the United States to have participated as bishops
in the biggest church event of the 20th century, the Second Vatican
Council, which was held in four sessions from 1962 to 1965.
   They are:
   -- Cuban-born Maronite Archbishop Francis M. Zayek of the
Diocese of St. Maron in Brooklyn. A priest since 1946, he was made
a bishop in charge of Maronites in Brazil in 1962. In 1966 he
became the first exarch of U.S. Maronites, and when the exarchate
was made a diocese in 1971 he became its first bishop. In 1982 he
was given the personal title of archbishop. His 75th birthday was
Oct. 18.
   -- Auxiliary Bishop John J. Ward of Los Angeles, a priest since
1946 and a bishop since 1963. He turned 75 Sept. 28.
   Also 75 but still active at the start of the new year were:
   -- Bishop Edward T. Hughes, a priest since 1947, a bishop since
1976 and head of the Diocese of Metuchen, N.J., since 1986. He
turned 75 Nov. 13.
   -- Bishop Michael F. McAuliffe, a priest since 1945 and bishop
of Jefferson City, Mo., since 1969. He turned 75 Nov. 22.
   The bishops who will celebrate their 75th birthday in 1996 are:
   -- May 30: Bishop Norbert F. Gaughan, a priest since 1945,
bishop since 1975 and bishop of Gary, Ind., since 1984. Partially
incapacitated by a stroke in 1992, he has remained head of the
diocese but Bishop Dale J. Melczek has assisted him as apostolic
administrator since 1992 and coadjutor since last October.
   -- June 11: Bishop Leroy T. Matthiesen, a priest since 1946
and bishop of Amarillo, Texas, since 1980. In December he had
surgery to replace a heart valve.
   -- July 17: Auxiliary Bishop John B. McDowell of Pittsburgh,
a priest since 1945 and bishop since 1966.
   -- Aug. 1: Auxiliary Bishop Benedict C. Franzetta of
Youngstown, Ohio, a priest since 1950 and bishop since 1980.
   -- Aug. 14: Auxiliary Bishop James J. Daly of Rockville Centre,
N.Y., a priest since 1947 and bishop since 1977.
   -- Dec. 20: Bishop Thomas J. Welsh, a priest since 1946, bishop
since 1970 and bishop of Allentown, Pa., since 1983.
   Church law calls for bishops to submit their resignations to
the pope when they reach 75.
   Pope Paul VI, who first established the retirement rules,
generally accepted resignations promptly with the exception of
important bishops in troubled areas, such as under communist rule
in Eastern Europe.
   Pope John Paul has developed a more flexible approach. He
frequently delays retirement if the bishop has an important
anniversary coming up soon, such as the 50th anniversary of his
priesthood or the 25th or 30th since he became a bishop.
   Cardinals or archbishops who are particularly close to the pope
or who head one of the more important archdioceses in a country may
have their retirement delayed up to several years if they are in
good health.

DALY-BRITISH (from ARMAGH, Northern Ireland)
CARDINAL SAYS BRITISH INFLEXIBILITY IS MAIN OBSTACLE TO PEACE

By Catholic News Service
   ARMAGH, Northern Ireland (CNS) -- Political inflexibility on
the part of Britain is the main obstacle to a lasting peace in
Northern Ireland, said Cardinal Cahal Daly of Armagh.
   But the cardinal said he understood it was difficult for
British Prime Minister John Major to exercise flexibility at this
time because of his thin majority in British Parliament.
   However, it would be unfortunate if this problem led to the
suspicion that peace in Northern Ireland would be allowed to suffer
because of British political problems, he added.
   ``I do not believe that the prime minister would wish this to
happen,'' the cardinal said during a Jan. 1 Mass homily in Armagh's
St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   ``I am convinced of his personal commitment to establishing
peace in Northern Ireland,'' he said.
   ``I do earnestly hope that, in cooperation with the Irish
government and with the agreement of the political parties in
Northern Ireland, he will succeed in bringing this about,'' he
said.
   The cardinal spoke at a time when Major's Conservative Party
has a small majority in the House of Commons and its survival may
depend on support from the Northern Ireland Unionist Members of
Parliament who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United
Kingdom.
   Another obstacle to developing a peace plan is controversy over
the surrender of arms by the Irish Republican Army as well as
paramilitary groups favoring continued British rule.
   The British government wants the IRA to decommission its
weapons before its political wing, Sinn Fein, can participate in
peace talks. The IRA said the turning in of arms should be part of
the peace talks agenda and not a precondition for negotiations.
   Cardinal Daly favored including Sinn Fein in peace talks as a
way to achieve disarmament.
   He said that the principle of disarmament had to be accepted
by everyone and that the only realistic way to achieve this was for
the paramilitary organizations themselves to decide to disarm.
   ``In turn, the only people whose influence could persuade them
do so are the political leaders who support their political aims,''
he added.
   ``It is abundantly clear that these political leaders will
agree to do so only in the context of an overall political
settlement,'' he said.
   ``It is therefore clearly necessary that there should be
political talks in which these political leaders take part. If
there are other realistic and practical ways of bringing
decommissioning about, I am not aware that anyone has yet
identified them,'' he said.

CANADA-FUNERAL (from OTTAWA)
FUNERAL HELD FOR CANADIAN BISHOP KILLED IN AUTO CRASH
By Christopher Guly

Catholic News Service
   OTTAWA (CNS) -- Funeral services were held for Bishop Pierre
Fisette and two other religious from the northern Ontario Diocese
of Hearst who were killed in an auto accident.
   The three died Dec. 21 while traveling to Kapuskasing -- an
hour's drive south of Hearst. Along with Bishop Fisette, 52, the
other victims were Father Viateur Allary, 67, a member of the
Society for Foreign Missions, and Notre Dame Sister Micheline
Bolduc, 57.
   According to the police report, a pickup truck attempted to
pass them on the right, forcing Bishop Fisette's vehicle into the
oncoming lane where it was broadsided.
   The bishop and his passengers died instantly, according to the
report.
   Born in Steinbach, Manitoba, Feb. 2, 1943, Bishop Fisette
attended high school and university at Le College Universitaire de
Saint-Boniface in Winnipeg, where he graduated in 1963.
   After joining the Society for Foreign Missions, the future
bishop was ordained to the priesthood in 1968.
   Then-Father Fisette spent the next quarter-century working in
the southern Philippines as a missionary.
   He was consecrated bishop of Hearst in March 1994.
   Ottawa Archbishop Marcel Gervais was the main celebrant at the
funeral Mass held Dec. 27 in Hearst.

YOUTHS-METAL (from ST. PAUL, Minn.)
TEENS HAMMER AWAY IN METAL MINISTRY PROJECT

With photo to come.
By Catholic News Service
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (CNS) -- Metal-shop ministry is one of Father
Frank Wampach's side jobs.
   Under his tutelage, youths at the two Minnesota parishes where
Father Wampach is pastor -- St. Paul in Zumbrota and St. Mary in
Bellechester -- have been pounding away in the workshop he set up
at St. Mary. They are making brass crosses similar to the thousands
their parish priest has made and given away as gifts for
confirmations, baptisms and other special occasions.
   Father Wampach said he has larger goals in mind as he teaches
the foundry skills it takes to craft a marketable product.
   ``I can do an awful lot in the shop from a human point of
view,'' he told the Catholic Bulletin, newspaper of the Archdiocese
of St. Paul and Minneapolis. ``Working in the shop it's easy to
make a mistake. That's when young people can learn to forgive
themselves and move on.''
   Using a hammer and anvil, soldering iron and polishing wheel,
teen-agers learn that most things take a process to complete and
that teamwork makes the process easier, said Father Wampach. He
picked up blacksmith skills during a break from the seminary to
discern his vocation.
   The youths hope to sell more than 100 of the metal crosses, and
Father Wampach said it will be up to the teens to decide how to
spend the profits. He hopes they will see the need not only to fund
their own social events but also to designate a portion for the
needy.
   ``Having or making a product is one thing,'' he said. ``But
there is a lot more to be learned in this. We'll be talking about
the financial responsibility of stewardship -- what do you do with
the money when you make it.''
   The youths already have an order for crosses that will be used
as confirmation gifts by a parish in Kasson in the Diocese of
Winona, Minn.

TV REVIEWS ADD

   Add to TV REVIEWS of Dec. 29, 1995:
               ``The Winter's Tale,'' Jan. 14, HBO
   The Emmy Award-winning series, ``Shakespeare -- The Animated
Tales,'' returns for a second season beginning with ``The Winter's
Tale,'' premiering Sunday, Jan. 14, 7:30-8 p.m. EST on the HBO pay
cable channel.
   Not one of the Bard's more popular plays,``The Winter's Tale''
is a strange tragic fantasy with a happy ending as the gods of
whimsy intervene in the activities of mortals.
   The story begins with the king of Sicilia banishing his infant
daughter because he mistakenly believes his queen to be unfaithful,
whereupon the poor woman dies of grief.
   His lost daughter is found and raised by shepherds who are as
unaware of her royal origins as she herself is.
   Some 16 years pass when, smitten with her beauty, the prince
of Bohemia seeks to marry her despite his father, whose wrath
causes them to flee.
   They wind up in Sicilia where the daughter is welcomed by her
grief-stricken father, all the principals are reconciled and the
shepherds rewarded for their kindness, a truly feel-good ending.
   As with the others in the series, the adaptation is by Leon
Garfield, the animation is the work of Russian craftsmen and the
voices are supplied by British actors.
   The half-hour format gives the gist of the action and the
British delivery of the Elizabethan dialogue captures the spirit
of the characters.
   But it is the imaginative animation which makes these digests
worth seeing. Using stop-motion puppets and evocative art design,
``The Winter's Tale'' establishes a fantasy world playfully
diverting in itself but entirely in keeping with Shakespeare's
intent.
   This is what children will find most enjoyable, once past the
dark, threatening beginning.
   So too will adults, though it also serves as an introduction
to one of Shakespeare's plays that most will never have an
opportunity to read or see produced on the stage. (HH)
           ``Pharaohs and Kings: A Biblical Quest,''
                 Jan. 14, Learning Channel cable
   Egyptologist David Rohl shows viewers where his archeological
investigations of Old Testament history have led in ``Pharaohs and
Kings: A Biblical Quest,'' premiering Sunday, Jan. 14, 8-11 p.m.
EST on cable's Learning Channel.
   Traditional archeology has never found any concrete evidence
of Moses leading the Hebrew people from the land of Egypt. Yet
British archeologist Rohl claims to have found artifacts verifying
not only Exodus but other events in biblical history.
   His claims, however, are based on his controversial redating
of the accepted chronology of the pharaohs' dynasties because they
did not properly jibe with his reading of the archeological
evidence.
   In an effort to corroborate his revised chronology, Rohl tried
to match his new dates with biblical events and found that he was
able to do so, at least to his satisfaction.
   While the documentary shows Rohl's enthusiasm over his
discoveries, it also listens as his more sober peers discount them
as interesting speculation but far from proven.
   Viewers are not called upon to make any judgment about the
relative merits of Rohl's revision of Egyptian chronology or the
controversy they have sparked in relation to biblical archeology.
   Whether Rohl is on the right track or not, the documentary
provides an archeological tour of Egypt and the Holy Land in the
company of a seasoned observer who brings the evidence of the past
to life.
   Rohl's speculation about Egyptian clay tablets relating to
Kings Saul and David, the fall of Jericho and the Jerusalem
residence of Solomon's Egyptian queen are fascinating examples of
archeological detective work.
   Most spectacular is his conjecture that the Egyptian remains
of a massive statue whose face had been almost totally mutilated
is actually that of a monument to the patriarch Joseph who had led
the Israelites to Egypt.
   Though the evidence here seems pretty thin, it is in keeping
with one's expectations of Joseph's place in the Egypt of his day.
   While Rohl's unorthodox interpretations of the ancient history
of the Near East may never gain acceptance from his peers, this
documentary about his work is a stimulating introduction to the
challenges and wonders of biblical archeology. (HH)

VICTIMS (from ELIZABETH, N.J.)
NEW JERSEY PARISH HOLDS FUNERAL FOR COLOMBIAN PLANE CRASH VICTIMS
By Michael Wojcik

Catholic News Service
   ELIZABETH, N.J. (CNS) -- A Colombian folk song, ``Los
Guaduales,'' says: ``They cry, they cry because they also have a
soul. I have seen them crying in the valleys when an afternoon wind
separates them. I have also seen them happy when intertwined.''
   The song speaks of the branches of a willowlike South American
bamboo, but Father Sean Cunneen played it during his homily at the
funeral Mass Dec. 29 for Patricia Jimenez, 37, and her daughters,
Erika and Vanesa, victims of the American Airlines plane crash Dec.
20 near Cali, Colombia.
   The mountainside crash took the lives of 160 of the 164 people
aboard the Miami-to-Cali flight.
   ``We're like the tree. We cry when we're separated,'' said
Father Cunneen, pastor of Blessed Sacrament Parish in Elizabeth,
where the Jimenezes have been parishioners since they moved to New
Jersey 15 years ago.
   Patricia Jimenez's husband, Fernando, was supposed to have been
on the same plane with his wife and daughters, on their way to
spend Christmas with relatives in Colombia, but he was delayed and
had planned to join them a few days later.
   Instead he found himself surrounded by more than 700 fellow
mourners at the funeral and burial of his wife and daughters.
   For the family's sake, reporters were asked not to attend, but
Father Cunneen later talked about it with The Catholic Advocate,
Newark archdiocesan newspaper, and Catholic News Service.
   He said Erika, 18, who was born in Cali, was a member of the
Elizabeth High School band.
   Vanesa, 8, was born in Elizabeth. Father Cunneen said she was
in the middle of preparations to receive first Communion.
   He said he had been deeply moved by ``Los Guaduales'' when he
first heard the song during a several-week stay in Cali almost 20
years ago.
   He played a recording of it during his homily, he said, because
it has a deeply Christian message. Like the tree's branches,
``people are filled with sorrow when we must be apart but pleased
when we are together again,'' he said.
   The words also remind us that we are happy when we are near
God and remind us that a Christian death is the fulfillment of our
destiny to be reunited with the Lord, he said.
   ``We don't know why these things happen,'' he said of the
airline crash. ``But we do know that God is with us.''
   That is the message of the Christmas season, he added:
``Emmanuel -- God is with us.''

FARMER (from JONESVILLE, Mich.)
FARMER HOPES TO PROMOTE CATHOLIC RURAL LIFE MOVEMENT IN MICHIGAN
By Robert Delaney

Catholic News Service
   JONESVILLE, Mich. (CNS) -- Dolores DeBacker thinks both farmers
and city dwellers should learn more about the issues affecting
agriculture and how Catholic social teaching applies to them.
   ``I'm not saying I'm going to change the world, but I hope to
bring an awareness of food issues,'' said Mrs. DeBacker, who lives
on an 800-acre farm just north of Jonesville in south-central
Michigan.
   A member of St. Anthony of Padua Parish in the Diocese of
Lansing, she is working with the Michigan Catholic Conference and
representatives from several Michigan dioceses to help build the
Catholic rural life movement in the state.
   Its goals include promoting an appreciation of farming as a
vocation and a sense of community among farmers, as well as greater
understanding of how national and state policies impact family
farms, farm workers, and the cost and availability of food.
   Mrs. DeBacker said there is cause for concern about a number
of trends affecting farmers, such as the dwindling number of family
farms, the growth of corporate farming and increasing dominance of
large ``agribusiness'' corporations, the disappearance of locally
owned and managed banks, and the sustainability of many modern
farming practices. All of these could not only mean tougher times
ahead for small farmers, but also could adversely affect the food
available to consumers, she said.
   Some of these factors stem largely from governmental policies
that have favored large-scale corporate operators over family
farmers. Others have more to do with lifestyle and buying habits
of both farmers and consumers that have wrought huge changes in
food production and sales patterns over the past several decades,
Mrs. DeBacker said.
   Shifting government policies that have promoted larger-scale
and more intensive farming have left many farmers with huge debts
and raised the threshold of capital needed for a young farmer to
get started, according to Mrs. DeBacker. ``Everything has gotten
bigger and more impersonal, and there are fewer and fewer of us
now,'' she said.
   The trend toward concentration has been especially marked when
it comes to the companies that purchase crops from farmers, she
said. Whereas there used to be many markets for a farmer's produce,
now there are five major grain dealers that operate worldwide, she
said. ``These companies are controlling everything from the seed
to what sits on the shelf.''
   Farmers themselves need to have a greater appreciation of their
role as stewards of the land, a sense of farming as a worthy
vocation -- ``of creating something out of God's gifts'' -- and a
greater understanding of the importance of a sense of community.
``I think we need to lead a different lifestyle -- not just like
the Amish, but they are a witness,'' she said.
   Consumers also need to gain a greater understanding of food
issues, and perhaps consider how they have played into the hands
of large agribusiness conglomerates by their growing appetite for
processed and prepared foods instead of cooking meals from scratch,
Mrs. DeBacker said. ``People don't know how to cook, they don't
know how to shop. These companies promote the idea that, if you buy
all these things, your life is going to be easier, but it isn't
easier,'' she said.
   Mrs. DeBacker added, however, that she understands that food
issues are pretty foreign to most city dwellers, because they once
were for her, too.
   Mrs. DeBacker and her husband, Frank, both grew up in Detroit.
When they first decided to go into farming in 1962, they started
with a 175-acre farm in Armada. They moved to their present farm
in 1972, and eventually expanded it to 800 acres. They milk 180
cows and grow corn and wheat.
   Mrs. DeBacker said she is glad the Catholic Church is promoting
the Catholic rural life movement. ``I think it's the church's place
to call us to re-examine our lives,'' she said. ``I don't see how
we can just keep consuming, and not care about each other.''

PIERONEK (from WARSAW, Poland)
CHURCH OFFICIALS BOYCOTT POLISH PRESIDENT'S INAUGURATION
By Jonathan Luxmoore

Catholic News Service
   WARSAW, Poland (CNS) -- A top official of the Polish bishops'
conference cited legal and political considerations for the
decision by church leaders to boycott the inauguration of the
country's new president, a former communist.
   Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, conference secretary-general, said he
and Polish primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp declined invitations to
the Dec. 23 ceremony for President Aleksander Kwasniewski because
of:
   -- A Supreme Court ruling that Kwasniewski had violated
campaign laws.
   -- Outgoing President Lech Walesa's decision to boycott the
inaugural.
   -- Allegations made by a Walesa supporter that Kwasniewski ally
Premier Jozef Olesky had been a KGB agent.
   ``The climate generated by the behavior of the president-elect,
who did not react to the Supreme Court's statement that he had
violated the law, as well as the demonstrative activity of
President Walesa, and the issues connected with premier Olesky --
 these factors made us decide against attending the inauguration,''
Bishop Pieronek said in a Dec. 28 interview with Catholic News
Service.
   The inauguration was attended by leaders of minority churches,
including the Orthodox Church, as well as by Vatican nuncio
Archbishop Jozef Kowalczyk.
   Pope John Paul II sent Kwasniewski best wishes for a ``fruitful
service to the Polish nation's welfare.''
   In a telegram to Walesa, the pope praised the Solidarity
movement that the ex-president had founded and said it had
established a ``Polish path'' that other nations had adopted in
``peacefully rejecting the injustices of the Marxist system.''
   Observers of the Polish political scene predicted a sharp
deterioration in church-state relations in the wake of a bitter
election campaign in which most church leaders publicly opposed
Kwasniewski.
   In a pre-Christmas decision, Poland's Supreme Court ruled that
Kwasniewski had given out false biographical information during the
campaign. But the court declined to order a new election.
   ``The issue should be clarified very quickly, without any side-
taking,'' Bishop Pieronek told KAI, Poland's Catholic Information
Agency.
   He also blamed Polish democracy for allowing the former
communists ``to grab part of the national property and become a new
class of capitalists, while at the same time permitting a party
with its origins in the Polish United Workers Party (the communist
party during Marxist rule) to legitimize itself in different
forms.''
   In his inaugural address, Kwasniewski said he is ``counting on
dialogue with opposition forces.''
   He said that as a member of the Polish political left, he
stands for ``justice, national liberties, and human rights.''
   ``I am certain that the greatest contribution to agreement
should be made by the relationship of the state and its structures
with the churches, especially the Polish Roman Catholic Church,''
he said.
   He said consideration should be given to how church-state
relations should look in a ``modern democratic state of law.''
   He said he would respect all church members who think in terms
of the ``supreme interests of our common state.''
   ``But I would also like there to be no doubts that nothing will
be achieved on the path of confrontation and heated emotions,''
he said.
   Several Polish newspapers noted that Kwasniewski, a self-
declared agnostic, had omitted the traditional words ``So help me
God'' at the end of his presidential oath.
   Among his first appointments, the new president named leading
supporters Danuta Waniek and Marek Ungier, both longtime
communists, to senior presidential staff posts.
   In his traditional televised Christmas Eve broadcast, Cardinal
Glemp said he shares ``the doubts awakened in many hearts'' by
recent events, adding that ``political elements'' are causing fear
and insecurity among Polish Catholics.
   ``The policies of the church and of people of good will are to
help each other, and not allow the evil which surrounds us to
develop,'' he said.
   The formerly communist daily Trybuna said in a front-page
commentary that ``the president and the church hierarchy can and
should act in an above-party manner, creating the space for talks
between various circles, organizing meetings between those who
stand far from each other, controlling political and social
emotions, and giving a good example of culture in public life.''

INDONESIA-SOEKOTO (from JAKARTA, Indonesia)
INDONESIAN ARCHBISHOP DIES OF SPINAL CANCER

By Catholic News Service
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNS) -- Retired Archbishop Leo Soekoto of
Jakarta died Dec. 30 of spinal cancer at St. Elizabeth Catholic
Hospital in Semarang. He was 75.
   The body of the late archbishop, whose resignation as head of
Jakarta Archdiocese took effect Nov. 10, was taken to Semarang's
Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Cathedral, where it remained for
viewing Dec. 31.
   Several government officials were among those who paid their
respects, reported UCA News, an Asian church news agency based in
Thailand.
   Thousands of Catholic mourners attended the Jesuit archbishop's
Jan. 1 funeral Mass, at which Cardinal Julius Darmaatmadja of
Semarang presided.
   Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Vatican pronuncio, was among the seven
bishops and 60 priests concelebrating the Mass.
   In his homily, Cardinal Darmaatmadja said the Indonesian
Catholic Church has lost a great leader and thinker who was able
to assess situations clearly.
   The cardinal praised the late archbishop's determined
leadership, strong commitment to principles and courage to express
views ``against the current.''
   After the Mass, Archbishop Soekoto's coffin was taken to
Girisonta, southwest of Semarang, to be buried at the Jesuit
cemetery close to the tomb of his eldest brother, the late Jesuit
Father Antonius Soenarjo, a former superior of the Jesuit Indonesia
province.
   Archbishop Soekoto was born in Jali, a village in Yogyakarta
province. Ordained a Jesuit priest in 1953, he was ordained
archbishop of Jakarta in 1970.
   In a farewell letter to Jakarta Catholics when he retired, the
archbishop asked forgiveness for ``the sins and mistakes I
committed in the past 25 years.''
   His most notable and well-known sin, he said, was being ``a
hot-headed man.''

KOREA-CHARGE (from SEOUL, South Korea)
PRIEST RECEIVES NOTICE OF CHARGE ON CHRISTMAS DAY

By Catholic News Service
   SEOUL, South Korea (CNS) -- A Korean priest who had allegedly
violated parole was given notice on Christmas Day that he was the
first person charged under the 1989 Security Watch Law.
   Father Paul Mun Kyu-hyon, a representative of the Priests'
Association for Justice and a priest of Yochon parish in Chonju
Diocese, was notified by the Chonbuk provincial prosecutor that he
had been indicted for the violation, UCA News, an Asian church news
agency based in Thailand, reported.
   In 1989, Father Mun was sentenced to five years' imprisonment
after he violated South Korea's National Security Law by traveling
to Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, without official permission.
   He was paroled Dec. 24, 1992, as a part of a Christmas amnesty.
   According to the Chonbuk prosecutor, the Security Watch Law
obliged Father Mun to inform the head of the local police station
where he lived of his release within seven days of leaving prison.
   Because Father Mun failed to meet that obligation, the
prosecutor said, he was indicted.
   Father Mun told UCA News Dec. 27 that he had intentionally
violated the law.
   ``I ignored summons letters of the police station 10 times,
because (the Security Watch Law) is an evil law not worth
obeying,'' he said.
   Authorities must have hurried to indict him, he added,
``because they did not even write the exact date of indictment.''
   ``I will fight to abolish the law with any sacrifice. But (the
authorities) might feel constrained to punish me,'' Father Mun
said.

The strength of small church communities "comes from a concerted

The strength of small church communities "comes from a concerted
effort to delve more deeply into Christian life on a more personal
level, while at the same time remaining intimately linked to the
church's universal mission," according to a statement just
published by the U.S. bishops' Committee on Hispanic Affairs. While
the statement focuses on small church communities among Hispanic
Catholics, much that it says should prove useful to other small
groups too.
   Titled "Communion and Mission: A Guide on Small Church
Communities for Bishops and Pastoral Agents," the statement's
publication was approved by the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops' Administrative Committee. One noteworthy feature of the
statement is a special section of questions to aid small groups in
a process of self-evaluation.
   Small church communities are not a new thing, the statement
says. They have existed for many years in the United States, "but
in different forms and at times separated from the parish
community." This separation may have occurred "because there has
been little ecclesial information developed in the United States
as to how to foster them, respond to their presence or work with
them in our parish communities." However, this situation appears
to be changing, the statement suggests.
   What is significant about the small size of these communities,
the statement says, is that it allows the "members to relate on a
personal level and help to develop interconnectedness and
belonging. The smallness of the group encourages concentration of
church life and mission, not separation from the larger church
community."
   The statement explains that small groups "are not simply
associations for intimate self-disclosure and emotional support"
of the members. Rather, it says, the groups "promote their members'
growth through the experiences and processes in which they discover
and accept their God-given vocation."
   The new statement "seeks to shed light on the potential that
small church communities can have in efforts to promote the new
evangelization, particularly in meeting the challenge of making
evangelization new in its ardor, methodology and expression," it
says. In today's small church groups it can be seen that "a new
ecclesial reality is emerging ... through which we can see the
creative grace of God at work," the statement notes. It calls these
groups "a source of great hope for the whole church."
   For Hispanics, small church groups are a place in which
"religious and cultural identity is affirmed," says the statement.
Moreover, "the strong sense of family which Hispanics retain in
their daily living is strengthened" in these groups.
   "When solidly rooted in Scripture, church tradition and Hispanic
religiosity, small church communities constitute a new moment in
the church's self-understanding, epitomizing the celebration and
proclamation of the church," the statement comments. It says
"Hispanics look to these communities for a credible experience of
evangelization, where the Gospel is preached and truly lived in
daily life."
   One apparent objective of the new statement is to link today's
small church communities with the larger church on the parish and
diocesan level, as well as to interrelate what is new about these
communities with church tradition. Here are four examples of this
theme's development in the statement:
   1. "Small church communities fortify a centuries-old tradition
of faith. Affirmed and strengthened in their identity as Catholics,
Hispanics can better serve the larger community. Yet, while small
communities serve to preserve a vibrant faith, they are not simply
warehouses of religious and cultural traditions. They are truly the
expression of an emerging spirituality."
   2. "The sharing of faith stories reinforces the experience that
Christian life is communitarian. Reading and meditating upon the
sacred Scriptures in community helps us to understand the meaning
of Scripture with the mind of the church, thus avoiding
individualistic and erroneous interpretations. This leads to a
renewed link with the Christian tradition and a deeper
understanding of the church as 'koinonia."'
   3. "Small ecclesial communities can avoid the trap of being
self-serving through a grounding in their mission and through
interconnection with other levels of church. The communitarian
aspect strongly emphasizes this unity as an essential element of
being church. This unity forms a bridge with other communities,
allowing the mission of God to flourish."
   4. "Small church communities must not be seen in isolation. They
are not another church, but part of the one church. Their major
contribution is the new expression of Christian life. They offer
the church a new inner life. Small communities are not a new
movement in the church. Nor are they simply neighborhood subgroups
of the parish structure. They are the church itself. They are a
smaller expression of the universal church. As such, the church is
developing new structures to allow this inner life to flourish. As
communities of faith and mission, they give witness to a renewal
of the church's inner life."
   The statement stresses the need for small church communities to
be in solidarity with the poor. "This helps the community endure
and retain sight of its ultimate goal of communion and mission. A
community matures by being missionary; otherwise it becomes
self-serving and self-destructive," it says.
   The statement includes 75 questions for small church groups to
use in their own self-evaluation. The questions relate to the
groups' composition, communitarian life, ecclesial role, liturgical
life, missionary thrust and ministerial role. For example it is
asked: "How does the group help its members discover a common
purpose in applying Gospel values to all aspects of their
lives? ... How is the small community linked with the parish
community? ... Does the community participate in the sacramental
preparation of its members: baptism, first communion, marriage? ...
How often does the community go on retreat?"
   Among other self-evaluation questions, the statement asks: "How
do members get to know the needs of the persons in the community
and in the larger parish community? ... How are the members helped
to articulate their personal faith journey and their call to
participate in the mission of Christ to build the reign of God? ...
How do the members help each other understand the group's role in
the mission of Christ? ...
   "How is the Bible used in the group's gatherings? ... Give
examples to show how the community is maturing as church.... How
does the community plan to give direction to its prophetic stance
as a countercultural community and servant to the reign of God? ...
How are the members trained to be ministers and leaders? In the
community, in the parish, in the diocese? What type of training is
being offered?"
   The statement acknowledges that the growing number of small
church communities in parishes indicates that parishes "are
providing pastoral leadership and fostering credible structures."
But the statement has a cautionary note for parishes that are not
fostering small groups among Hispanics. It says:
   "Other parishes could also benefit greatly from the presence of
small church communities. Without parish support and proper
leadership, small groups could arise but lose direction.
Furthermore, fundamentalist groups could easily move in to fill a
vacuum." The statement says that "while many Latinos have not yet
found a home in our society, they have generally found one in the
church, especially in small church communities....
   "Many Hispanic Catholics are more comfortable with small
communities where people know one another and can interact with
their priests and ministers on a personal level." (The statement
is available in English and Spanish from the U.S. Catholic
Conference Office of Publishing Affairs, 3211 Fourth St. N.E.,
Washington, D.C. 20017.)

Hunger, starvation, malnutrition: For Lent of 1996, Pope John Paul

Hunger, starvation, malnutrition: For Lent of 1996, Pope John Paul
II urges the church's people "to take significant practical
steps ... to multiply the few loaves and fish at our disposal."
This, he says, "will be an authentic way of living this
providential period of Lent." Nearly 800 million people in the
world "suffer from hunger and malnutrition," the pope says in his
1996 Lenten message. He calls hunger "a great tragedy afflicting
humanity." Feeding those who are hungry requires sacrifices, the
pope stresses. "Certainly it will involve changing our exaggerated
consumerist behavior, combatting hedonism, resisting attitudes of
indifference and the tendency to disregard our personal
responsibilities." Thus, feeding the hungry calls "for a deep inner
conversion." ...
   ...Some people might object that "a grand and unachievable
utopia" is demanded to meet the world's need for food, the pope
observes. But, he says, "the social teaching and activity of the
church demonstrate the contrary: Where men and women turn to the
Gospel, this project of sharing and solidarity becomes a remarkable
reality." The pope insists: "The earth has the resources necessary
to feed all humanity. We need to learn to use them intelligently,
respecting the environment and the rhythms of nature, guaranteeing
fairness and justice in business dealings and ensuring a
distribution of wealth which takes into account the duty of
solidarity." ...
   ..."Patient and responsible training from childhood on" is what
leads to "authentic Christian solidarity," the Lenten message
stresses. That's how a sense of solidarity becomes "a fundamental
personal attitude which affects all our actions and areas of
responsibility." What society needs, the pope says, is "a general
process of consciousness-raising, ... a process capable of
involving society as a whole." ...
   ...Lent, the pope says, is "a journey of love which opens the
hearts of believers to our brothers and sisters, and draws them to
God." He writes, "Each day we encounter people who are hungry,
thirsty or sick, people who are outcasts or migrants." This "Lent
we are invited to pay greater heed to the suffering written on
their faces."

"The territorial size of dioceses should be examined with a view

"The territorial size of dioceses should be examined with a view
to the creation of smaller dioceses so as to enhance the pastoral
dimensions of ministry," said the participants in the Vatican's
recent international symposium for the 30th anniversary of Vatican
Council II's Decree on the Life and Ministry of Priests. In a
concluding message to the world's priests, the participants thanked
priests for their "devotion, seen in the manifold works of each day
in which you are involved, and in your fatigue." It thanked priests
for "the hours passed in the confessional, the time given to
meeting and listening to people, helping them to discover and live
out the plan of God in their lives." ...
   ...At one point the symposium's concluding message said, "We
have been aware ... of those priests who are alone, those tested
by illness, the elderly; priests who are persecuted because of
Christ and his church, or victims of war and violence; priests who
for whatever reason live with whatever difficulty in their service
of God and of the church." At another point the message expressed
"a very special sentiment of affection and solidarity ... to all
priests who find themselves in difficult moments of loneliness, of
tiredness and discouragement."
   Not only should the churches "speak out honestly and bravely
against the root causes" of the forced displacement of the world's
125 million refugees, they should also "develop the capacity to
recognize, give early warning and take preventive action where
situations are developing which may lead to" people's forced
displacement, said the participants in a recent ecumenical meeting
in Addis Ababa of the representatives of humanitarian agencies,
sponsored by the Lutheran World Federation, the World Council of
Churches and the Catholic Church's relief agency, Caritas
Internationalis. The meeting's focus was consistent with concerns
expressed in this area by the Vatican, which in 1992 issued a major
document titled "Refugees: A Challenge of Solidarity," promoting
understanding of how many refugees "are forcibly uprooted" from
their homes....
   ..."People are increasingly uprooted because of gross violations
of human rights, destructive and unsustainable development,
oppressive actions by governments and, above all, warfare," said
participants in the November 1995 Addis Ababa conference. They
said, "Churches must be analytical, self-critical and confident in
exposing and seeking to correct such root causes of forced
migration and displacement, and the sin and greed underlying those
causes on local and global levels." ...
   ...What actions are called for among the churches? The Addis
Ababa meeting proposed that churches "promote educational,
artistic, media and interactive communications programs" to help
"church members and society at large to transcend barriers of
ethnicity, race, nationality and religion, to value the dignity of
each human being, to affirm the blessings of diversity and to be
vigilant in overcoming the language and practices of hate."
Intensified programs of "pastoral care and support for the
uprooted" were encouraged, along with increased "ecumenical and
interreligious collaboration" in advocacy on behalf of refugees.

What has been learned "about the Bible and its truth" as a

What has been learned "about the Bible and its truth" as a
result of major archeological discoveries of the 20th century, in
particular the discovery of Ugaritic literature in 1929 and the
discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947-56, was spelled out in
the recent speech Jesuit Father Joseph Fitzmyer gave at St.
Patrick's College in Maynooth, Ireland. The professor emeritus of
biblical studies at The Catholic University of America has been a
member of the Pontifical Biblical Commission since 1984. "All these
new discoveries in this century ... give us, first of all, a more
accurate understanding of how the Bible came to be, telling us
about the historical context from which God's written word, as we
have it, actually emerged. Second, they enlighten us about the
meaning of many texts that can feed our own spiritual and religious
lives," he said. For the more we learn about the Bible and the
context from which it grew, the more we come into closer contact
with the roots of our religious tradition....
   ..."Third," Father Fitzmyer said, "we learn that God's word did
not drop from heaven, in King James English to boot, but that it
has come to us from a venerable Jewish and Christian heritage,
which we cannot ignore. That tradition puts restraints on how we
interpret God's written word." Fourth, he said, we learn "that the
proper interpretation of the Bible can only be given when the
tradition, which came into being from the Bible itself, is properly
respected. We have learned how the ancient Qumran community had
such a Jewish tradition of its own, in the light of which it
interpreted God's word and produced its own parabiblical
literature. From such a community we, as Christians, can learn that
we too must interpret our Scriptures in the light of the tradition
that has grown out of such a Jewish-Christian heritage."

Christian Arabs often are forgotten both by Muslims and Christians
of the West. But Christians in the Middle East have a crucial role
to play in bridging the gap between Muslims and the West, said
Jesuit Father Samir Khalil Samir, who teaches theology in Beirut
and Rome. Interviewed by Vatican Radio this month, he said mutual
ignorance has made it difficult for the West to understand the
Islamic world, and vice versa. Just as people in the West "know
very little about Islam, and the image most people have comes from
television," so Christianity is largely unknown among Middle East
Muslims, Samir said.

About 150 people peacefully occupied San Salvador's cathedral Jan.
4, protesting a government plan known as Decree 471 in which some
15,000 state employees were laid off at the start of the new year.
The cathedral had been under accelerated reconstruction in
preparation for the pope's Feb. 8 visit. The Salvadoran bishops'
conference asked the protesters to leave the cathedral, saying that
"the church recognizes in its daily pastoral work that large
numbers live in dramatic conditions ... but the end does not
justify the means.... The legitimate claims of the people should
be resolved using the proper channels."

Former French President Francois Mitterrand, who died of prostate

Former French President Francois Mitterrand, who died of prostate
cancer Jan. 8, once said he was born a Catholic and would perhaps
die one. But in life he was an agnostic. When Mitterrand was
president, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris called on him two
or three times a year, always staying to discuss questions of life
and death or what sense can be made of war and suffering, according
to a Catholic News Service report by Barry James, who said
Mitterrand was intrigued by the philosophical and religious issue
of life after death. James wrote that Mitterrand told Elie Wiesel,
a philosopher and Jewish Holocaust survivor, that he had drawn
apart from religion without denying God or forgetting the faith of
his childhood. "I doubt. I am in the desert. God is absent,"
Mitterrand told Wiesel in a joint book published last year. "But
I continue to believe in him and serve him."

its weapons as a precondition for talks on the future political
status of British-ruled Northern Ireland. The organization made its
statement a week before an international commission was scheduled
to release recommendations on the disarmament of guerrilla groups
in Northern Ireland. Controversy over decommissioning of weapons
has been the key issue preventing all-party peace talks on the
political future of Northern Ireland. The IRA also said that its
disarmament must be tied to the disarming of the mostly Protestant
paramilitary groups and individuals favoring continuation of
British rule.

U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Raymond Flynn faced a possible State
Department reprimand for a letter he mailed to some 1,000 U.S.
Catholic leaders last spring which called the U.S. congressional
debate on poverty programs "mean-spirited." A State Department
investigator recommended that Flynn be reprimanded for "showing
signs of partisanship" and "poor judgment" in failing to follow
department clearance procedures before mailing the letter. Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, had complained to the secretary of state, saying: "It
appears that Ambassador Flynn is making the claim ... that one
political party is better suited than another to the Vatican's
teachings on poverty." Flynn accepted the charge of failing to
follow procedure, but disagreed with the accusation of
partisanship. "I said the debate was mean-spirited. There were both
Democrats and Republicans" voting to cut social spending and
foreign development aid.

LET US GIVE CHILDREN A FUTURE OF PEACE: 1996 WORLD DAY OF PEACE
MESSAGE,
by Pope John Paul II

   "I feel bound to mention in a particular way children who are
suffering and those who often grow to adulthood without ever having
experienced peace," Pope John Paul II says in his message for the
World Day of Peace Jan. 1, 1996. The theme for the 1996 observance
is "Let Us Give Children a Future of Peace." In it the pope
discusses numerous forms of violence against children. "Many of the
world's children are innocent victims of war. In recent years
millions of them have been wounded or killed: a veritable
slaughter," the pope says. He notes that many children "are forced
to take an active part in" wars, which can compromise these
children's futures in unrelenting ways. Other forms of violence
against children also are discussed, including violence in the home
or the buying and selling of children for purposes of the drug
trade or prostitution. "If children are properly helped and loved,
they themselves can become peacemakers," Pope John Paul says. "It
can hardly be hoped that children will one day be able to build a
better world unless there is a specific commitment to their
education for peace. Children need to 'learn peace': It is their
right and one which cannot be disregarded," he writes. The roles
of the family and of schools are discussed by the pope. "The family
must be for children the first school of peace," he says. In
schools, he adds, children need to learn the history of peace and
not simply the history of victory and defeat in war." The Vatican's
English text of the message follows.

   1. At the end of 1994, the International Year of the Family, I
wrote a letter to the children of the whole world asking them to
pray that humanity would increasingly become God's family, living
in harmony and peace. I have frequently expressed my heartfelt
concern for children who are victims of armed conflicts and other
kinds of violence, and I have not failed to call these serious
situations to the attention of world public opinion.
   At the beginning of this new year, my thoughts turn once again
to children and to their legitimate hope for love and peace. I feel
bound to mention in a particular way children who are suffering and
those who often grow to adulthood without ever having experienced
peace. Children's faces should always be happy and trusting, but
at times they are full of sadness and fear: How much have these
children already seen and suffered in the course of their short
lives!
   Let us give children a future of peace! This is the confident
appeal which I make to men and women of good will, and I invite
everyone to help children to grow up in an environment of authentic
peace. This is their right, and it is our duty.

Children Who Are Victims of War
   2. I begin by thinking of the great crowds of children whom I
have met during the years of my pontificate, especially during my
apostolic visits to every continent: joyful children who are full
of happiness. My thoughts turn to them at the beginning of this new
year. It is my hope that all children of the world will be able to
begin 1996 in happiness and to enjoy a peaceful childhood with the
help of responsible adults.
   I pray that everywhere a harmonious relationship between adults
and children will promote a climate of peace and authentic
well-being. Sadly, many of the world's children are innocent
victims of war. In recent years millions of them have been wounded
or killed: a veritable slaughter.
   The special protection accorded to children by international
law(1) has been widely disregarded, and the dramatic increase of
regional and interethnic conflicts has made it difficult to
implement the protective measures called for by humanitarian
regulations. Children have even become targets of snipers, their
schools deliberately destroyed and the hospitals where they are
cared for bombed. In the face of such horrendous misdeeds, how can
we fail to speak out with one voice in condemnation? The deliberate
killing of a child is one of the most disturbing signs of the
breakdown of all respect for human life.(2)
   In addition to the children who have been killed, my thoughts
also turn to those who have been maimed during or after these
conflicts. I likewise think of young people who are systematically
hunted down, raped or killed during so-called "ethnic cleansings."
   3. Children are not only victims of the violence of wars; many
are forced to take an active part in them. In some countries of the
world it has come to the point where even very young boys and girls
are compelled to serve in the army of the warring parties. Enticed
by the promise of food and schooling, they are confined to remote
camps where they suffer hunger and abuse and are encouraged to kill
even people from their own villages. Often they are sent ahead to
clear minefields. Clearly, the life of children has little value
for those who use them in this way!
   The future of young people who have taken up arms is often
compromised. After years of military service, some are simply
discharged and sent home, where they often fail to fit into
civilian life. Others, ashamed of having survived when their
companions have not, frequently end up as criminals or drug
addicts. Who knows what nightmares must continue to afflict them!
Will their minds ever be free of the memories of violence and
death?
   The humanitarian and religious organizations which attempt to
relieve these inhuman sufferings deserve heartfelt respect. Thanks
are also owed to those generous individuals and families who
welcome orphans with love and do everything they can to heal their
traumas and to help them to fit once more into the communities from
which they came.
   4. The memory of the millions of children who have been killed
and the sad faces of so many others who are suffering compel us to
take every possible measure to safeguard or re-establish peace and
to bring conflicts and wars to an end.
   Before the Fourth World Conference on Women, which took place
in Beijing last September, I asked Catholic charitable and
educational institutions to adopt a coordinated strategy which
gives priority to issues concerning girls and young women,
especially those most in need.(3) Now I wish to renew that appeal
and to extend it in a special way to Catholic institutions and
organizations which deal with children. I ask them to help girls
who have suffered as a result of war and violence, to teach boys
to acknowledge and respect the dignity of women, and to help all
children to rediscover the tenderness of the love of God, who took
flesh, and who, by dying, left the world the gift of his peace (cf.
Jn 14:27).
   I will continue to point out that all, from the most prominent
international organizations to local associations, from heads of
state to ordinary citizens, in everyday actions and at the most
significant moments of life, are called upon to make a contribution
to peace and to give no support to war.

Children Who Are Victims of
Various Forms of Violence
   5. Millions of children suffer from other kinds of violence
present both in poverty-stricken and in developed societies. These
kinds of violence are often less obvious, but they are no less
terrible.
   The International Summit for Social Development which took place
this year in Copenhagen stressed the connection between poverty and
violence,(4) and on that occasion states committed themselves to
a greater battle against poverty through initiatives at the
national level, beginning in 1996.(5) Similar suggestions were made
by the earlier world conference of the United Nations on children,
held in New York in 1990. Poverty is indeed the cause of inhuman
living and working conditions. In some countries children are
forced to work at a tender age and are often badly treated, harshly
punished and paid absurdly low wages. Because they have no way of
asserting their rights, they are the easiest to blackmail and
exploit.
   In other circumstances children are bought and sold(6) so that
they can be used for begging or, even worse, forced into
prostitution, as in the case of so-called "sex tourism." This
utterly despicable trade degrades not only those who take part in
it but also those who in any way promote it. Some do not hesitate
to enlist children in criminal activities, especially the selling
of narcotics, thus exposing them to the risk of personal
involvement in drug use.
   Many children end up with the street as their only home. Having
run away, or having been abandoned by their families, or never
having known a family environment, these young people live by their
wits and in a state of total neglect, and they are considered by
many as refuse to be eliminated.
   6. Sadly, violence toward children is found even in wealthy and
affluent families. Such cases are infrequent, but it is important
not to overlook them. Sometimes children are taken advantage of and
suffer abuse within the home itself at the hands of people whom
they should be able to trust, to the detriment of their
development.
   Many children are also compelled to endure the trauma caused by
fighting between their parents or by the actual breakup of the
family. Concern for the children's welfare does not prevent
solutions which are often dictated by the selfishness and hypocrisy
of adults. Behind an appearance of normality and peacefulness,
masked even further by an abundance of material possessions,
children are at times forced to grow up in dismal loneliness,
without firm and loving guidance and a suitable moral formation.
Left to themselves, such children usually find their main contact
with reality in television programs, which often present unreal and
immoral situations which they are still too young to assess
properly.
   It is no wonder if this kind of widespread and pernicious
violence also has its effect on their young hearts, changing their
natural enthusiasm into disillusionment or cynicism, and their
instinctive goodness into indifference or selfishness. When young
people chase after false ideals, they can experience bitterness and
humiliation, hostility and hatred, absorbing the discontent and
emptiness all around them. Everyone is well aware of how childhood
experiences can have profound and sometimes irreparable
consequences on an individual's whole life.
   It can hardly be hoped that children will one day be able to
build a better world unless there is a specific commitment to their
education for peace. Children need to "learn peace": It is their
right, and one which cannot be disregarded.

Children and Hope for Peace
   7. I have sought to emphasize strongly the often tragic
conditions in which many children are living today. I consider this
my duty: They will be the adults of the third millennium. But I
have no intention of yielding to pessimism or ignoring the signs
of hope. How can I fail to mention, for example, the many families
in every part of the world in which children grow up in an
atmosphere of peace? And how can we not note the efforts being made
by so many individuals and organizations to enable children in
difficulty to grow up in peace and happiness? Public and private
associations, individual families and particular communities have
taken initiatives, the only purpose of which is to help children
who have suffered some traumatic event to return to a normal life.
In particular, educational programs have been developed for
encouraging children and young people to use fully their personal
talents in order to become true peacemakers.
   There is also a growing awareness in the international community
which, in recent years, despite difficulties and hesitation, has
made efforts to deal decisively and systematically with problems
connected with childhood.
   The results achieved thus far encourage us to continue these
praiseworthy endeavors. If children are properly helped and loved,
they themselves can become peacemakers, builders of a world of
fraternity and solidarity. With their enthusiasm and youthful
idealism, young people can become "witnesses" and "teachers" of
hope and peace to adults. Lest these possibilities be lost,
children should be offered, in a way adapted to their individual
needs, every opportunity for a balanced personal growth.
   A peaceful childhood will enable boys and girls to face the
future with confidence. Let no one stifle their joyful enthusiasm
and hope!

Children in the School of Peace
   8. Little children very soon learn about life. They watch and
imitate the behavior of adults. They rapidly learn love and respect
for others, but they also quickly absorb the poison of violence and
hatred. Family experiences strongly condition the attitudes which
children will assume as adults. Consequently, if the family is the
place where children first encounter the world, the family must be
for children the first school of peace.
   Parents have an extraordinary opportunity to help their sons and
daughters to become aware of this great treasure: the witness of
their mutual love. It is by loving each other that they enable the
child, from the very first moment of its existence, to grow up in
peaceful surroundings, imbued with the positive values which make
up the family's true heritage: mutual respect and acceptance,
listening, sharing, generosity, forgiveness. Thanks to the sense
of working together which these values foster, they provide a true
education for peace and make the child, from its earliest years,
an active builder of peace.
   Children share with their parents and brothers and sisters the
experience of life and hope. They see how life's inevitable trials
are met with humility and courage, and they grow up in an
atmosphere of esteem for others and respect for opinions different
from their own.
   It is above all in the home that, before ever a word is spoken,
children should experience God's love in the love which surrounds
them. In the family they learn that God wants peace and mutual
understanding among all human beings, who are called to be one
great family.
   9. Besides the basic education provided by the family, children
have a right to a specific training for peace at school and in
other educational settings. These institutions have a duty to lead
children gradually to understand the nature and demands of peace
within their world and culture. Children need to learn the history
of peace and not simply the history of victory and defeat in war.

   Let us show them examples of peace and not just examples of
violence! Fortunately, many positive examples of this can be found
in every culture and period of history. Suitable new educational
opportunities must be created, especially in those situations where
cultural and moral poverty has been most oppressive. Everything
possible should be done to help children to become messengers of
peace.
   Children are not a burden on society; they are not a means of
profit or people without rights. Children are precious members of
the human family, for they embody its hopes, its expectations and
its potential.

Jesus, the Way of Peace
   10. Peace is a gift of God; but men and women must first accept
this gift in order to build a peaceful world. People can do this
only if they have a childlike simplicity of heart. This is one of
the most profound and paradoxical aspects of the Christian message:
To become childlike is more than just a moral requirement, but a
dimension of the mystery of the incarnation itself.
   The Son of God did not come in power and glory, as he will at
the end of the world, but as a child, needy and poor. Fully sharing
our human condition in all things but sin (cf. Hb. 4:15), he also
took on the frailty and hope for the future which are part of being
a child. After that decisive moment for the history of humanity,
to despise childhood means to despise the one who showed the
greatness of his love by humbling himself and forsaking all glory
in order to redeem mankind.
   Jesus identified with the little ones. When the apostles were
arguing about who was the greatest, he "took a child and put him
by his side, and said to them, 'Whoever receives this child in my
name, receives me; and whoever receives me receives him who sent
me"' (Lk. 9:47-48). The Lord also forcefully warned us against
giving scandal to children: "Whoever causes one of these little
ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have
a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the
depth of the sea" (Mt. 18:6).
   Jesus asked the disciples to become "children" again. When they
tried to turn away the little ones who were pressing in upon him
he said indignantly: "Let the children come to me, do not hinder
them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you,
whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not
enter it" (Mk. 10:14-15). Jesus thus turned around our way of
thinking. Adults need to learn from children the ways of God:
Seeing children's capacity for complete trust, adults can learn to
cry out with true confidence, "Abba, Father!"
   11. To become like a little child -- with complete trust in the
Father and with the meekness taught by the Gospel -- is not only
an ethical imperative; it is a reason for hope. Even where the
difficulties are so great as to lead to discouragement and the
power of evil so overwhelming as to dishearten, those who can
rediscover the simplicity of a child can begin to hope anew. This
is possible above all for those who know they can trust in a God
who desires harmony among all people in the peaceful communion of
his kingdom. It is also possible for those who, though not sharing
the gift of faith, believe in the values of forgiveness and
solidarity and see in them -- not without the hidden action of the
Spirit -- the possibility of renewing the face of the earth.
   It is therefore to men and women of good will that I address
this confident appeal. Let us all unite to fight every kind of
violence and to conquer war! Let us create the conditions which
will ensure that children can receive as the legacy of our
generation a more united and fraternal world!
   Let us give children a future of peace!
   From the Vatican, Dec. 8, 1995.
   John Paul II

MARGIN NOTES TO LET US GIVE CHILDREN A FUTURE OF PEACE: 1996 WORLD
DAY OF PEACE MESSAGE

   The letter to the world's children issued by Pope John Paul II
for Christmas 1994 appeared in Origins, Vol. 24, pp. 481ff (Jan.
5, 1995).
   Also, in his message for the 1994 World Day of Peace (Origins,
Vol. 23, pp. 481ff, in the edition dated Dec. 23, 1993), the pope
discussed violence and the family. That year's World Day of Peace
theme was "The Family Creates the Peace of the Human Family." He
said:
   "In order to count on a peaceful future, every child needs to
experience the warmth of caring and constant affection, not
betrayal and exploitation. And although the state can do much by
providing means and structures of support, the contribution of the
family to ensuring that climate of security and trust cannot be
replaced, so important is it in helping young children to look to
the future with serenity and in preparing them to take a
responsible part in building a society of true progress when they
grow up. Children are the future already present among us; they
need to experience what peace means so that they will be able to
create a future of peace."

   For a recent text in Origins that is of current interest, see
"Walk in the Light," a statement on child sexual abuse, by the U.S.
bishops' Committee on Women in Society and in the Church, and their
Committee on Marriage and Family. It appeared in the current volume
of Origins, pp. 337ff (Nov. 2, 1995). "As a community of Christians
we have the means to shatter the walls of loneliness, shame and
fear that isolate those who are sexually abused and those who have
survived abuse. They need us, and we need to hear their stories of
pain, endurance and courage."

   Gun violence against children was discussed in a text by the
Connecticut Christian Conference that appeared in the current
volume of Origins, pp. 17ff (May 25, 1995). The conference is an
ecumenical group whose members include the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Hartford and the dioceses of Norwich and Bridgeport.

   See also the text titled "Steps Toward Overcoming Violence," by
Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, in Origins, Vol. 24, pp. 793ff (May
4, 1995). It focused on street violence against youths.


   "The family is the key to the development of positive values,
including peacemaking," the U.S. bishops said in their 1994
pastoral message titled "Confronting a Culture of Violence: A
Catholic Framework for Action" (Origins, Vol. 24, pp. 422ff, the
edition dated Dec. 1, 1994).
   It said also that "faith challenges each of us to examine how
we can contribute to an ethic which cherishes life, puts people
before things, and values kindness and compassion over anger and
vengeance."


   "Being a Christian in this society demands that we fight key
elements of our culture of violence," Jesuit Father John Coleman
said in a speech that appeared in the current volume of Origins,
pp. 180ff (Aug. 24, 1995). He said: "We harbor violence in our
hearts and perpetrate it in our deeds." Coleman urged people to
"pay attention to the attraction and embodiment of violence in our
own speech and actions. Ultimately, nonviolence, as Dorothy Day or
Gandhi knew, implies a profound conversion of heart and an aversion
to the roots of violence in culture, in individualism, racism,
vigilantism. They also knew that nonviolence was possible only in
community."

   QUOTE FROM A PAST TEXT OF CURRENT INTEREST:
   "Across the globe ... millions of children are dying -- from
starvation, disease, poverty and military conflict. According to
UNICEF, 40,000 children die every day from malnutrition and related
diseases.
   "Wars have killed nearly 2 million children in the last 15
years; more than twice that number have been physically disabled;
and it is not possible to even estimate the number who have been
traumatized as a result of these conflicts.
   "Seven million children are growing up in refugee camps because
of war and natural disasters; a slightly larger number have been
uprooted from their homes in their own countries....
   "Approximately 80 million children work in often monotonous,
repetitive and dangerous jobs; in some countries these exploited
children earn wages of five to seven cents an hour.
   "Fifteen percent of the world's 2 billion children under 15
years of age live under what UNICEF terms 'especially difficult
circumstances.' Millions, for example, live in the streets of the
exploding Third World cities, resorting to theft, drug trafficking,
prostitution and other desperate measures to survive....
   "Sickness ravages poor families. Diseases long banished or
generally unknown in the industrialized world -- measles, malaria,
sleeping sickness -- kill hundreds of thousands annually. And now
we see the worldwide consequences of AIDS, which will produce an
estimated 10 million orphans in this decade in Africa alone."
   (From "Putting Children and Families First: A Challenge for Our
Church, Nation and World," a November 1991 statement of the U.S.
bishops; Origins, Vol. 21, quoted material on  p. 396 in the
edition dated Nov. 28, 1991.)

THOSE WITH MENTAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES,
by Bishop John McCarthy

   "Today I call your attention to the special needs of those who
are emotionally disturbed, mentally ill or developmentally
disabled," Bishop John McCarthy of Austin, Texas, said in a letter
to the diocese issued at the start of Advent 1995. "Among our
population there are more than 35 million people who suffer from
some type of mental or emotional disability," he said. "One family
in four has been affected with this burden, and there is no parish
in this diocese or anywhere else that does not have parishioners
who carry the burden of mental disabilities or emotional illness."
But, McCarthy said, "many people with the problems that I am
discussing either stay away or are kept away from parish activities
because they know the meaning of rejection. Parishes and parish
organizations should go out of their way to identify these people
and invite them into our spiritual home." The bishop urged parents
to talk to their children and among themselves "about the complex
causes of mental illness, emotional distress and retardation. Let
our children know that within that person who seems different and
whom they might fear or shun there is an extraordinarily unique
person loved by God." McCarthy's text follows.

   I send you greetings this day as each of our 125 parishes joins
with the rest of the Christian world in beginning the holy season
of Advent, a period of preparation for the celebration of the birth
of the Savior.
   In deepening our awareness of God's love for us, we develop
within ourselves a capacity to love others to a greater extent. It
is the human love that responds to our awareness of divine love
that brings joy and happiness into our lives. It is the lessening
or the absence of love that produces lives that are arid, selfish
and unhappy.
   Let us seriously consider during this holy season expanding our
horizons where human love is concerned. Let us reach beyond a love
that is limited to those closest to us. Let us envelope those
persons who have a desperate need for love but who frequently do
not find it, even among those of us who claim to be followers of
Jesus of Nazareth.
   Regretfully, our society seems to have an inordinate, perhaps
immature, attachment to youthfulness, beauty and health. These are
excellent qualities, but most of us lack one or the other.
Ultimately, all of us will lose all three. The worth of every human
being is to be measured not by appearances or mental acumen, but
rather by the fact that each of us is an extraordinarily unique
being created by God and redeemed by Jesus Christ. Each person is
of infinite worth because each of us was created in the image of
God, "a little less than the angels."
   Today I call your attention to the special needs of those who
are emotionally disturbed, mentally ill or developmentally
disabled. Yes, these too are our brothers and sisters. They need
understanding and love. We, as the followers of Jesus, should be
the first to offer those gifts to them.
   While a large segment of our society may look with disdain and
fear on persons who are different, the followers of Jesus should
do the opposite. Among our population there are more than 35
million people who suffer from some type of mental or emotional
disability. One family in four has been affected with this burden,
and there is no parish in this diocese or anywhere else that does
not have parishioners who carry the burden of mental disabilities
or emotional illness. Needing understanding, support and love, they
all too frequently experience rejection, isolation and disdain.
   While parents are giving thought to preparations for their
children's Christmas, let me earnestly suggest that you consider
giving them the gifts of sensitivity and generosity. Talk to your
children and among yourselves about the complex causes of mental
illness, emotional distress and retardation. Let our children know
that within that person who seems different and whom they might
fear or shun there is an extraordinarily unique person loved by God
from all eternity. While encased for the time being in a human
habitat that does not function exactly the same way as the rest of
us, the sacredness of that individual is crying out to be
recognized. Talk to your children about the importance of going out
of their way to be kind to people that others might avoid.
Encourage them to invite children who face these problems into
their games and other activities. Parents who can do this will give
their children a gift of far greater value than any tricycle,
bicycle or other gift that won't last much longer than the
Christmas tree. You will be giving them the gift of compassion.
   Many people with the problems that I am discussing either stay
away or are kept away from parish activities because they know the
meaning of rejection. Parishes and parish organizations should go
out of their way to identify these people and invite them into our
spiritual home. One of the great messages of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ is that he was so at home with those who are different
-- the despised tax collector, the poor, the prostitute, the lame
and the crippled and the emotionally disturbed. Can we truly claim
to be his followers and not attempt to imitate him in this regard?
   The holy season of Advent is dominated by the image of John the
Baptist. You can say many things about the last of the Old
Testament prophets but one thing is certain: He was different!
Clothed with hides, living in the desert, dining on locusts,
shouting at passersby to straighten out their lives -- I doubt that
John was frequently invited to whatever was the equivalent to the
Rotary Club in that day and time. Yet he was the one that was
chosen by God to use to be the first bearer of the good news, to
draw the attention of the world to Jesus of Nazareth. Are
latter-day John the Baptists still in our midst? Do we see them?v

   The final report of a three-year archdiocesan planning project
in the Archdiocese of San Francisco was approved Dec. 15 by
Archbishop John Quinn, with the concurrence of San Francisco's new
coadjutor, Archbishop William Levada. The plan calls for increased
lay leadership and responsibility, and already has led to
establishment of the School of Pastoral Leadership, which now has
1,000 people enrolled. Other priorities in the final report call
for improved liturgies and homilies; strong support for vocations
to priesthood, diaconate and religious life; ongoing religious
education and formation for everyone, including stronger Catholic
schools and religious education programs, and regular adult
education; stronger advocacy and witness for the church's social
teachings by the archdiocese's people and institutions; and
involvement of young adults and youth in service to others.
   In terms of archdiocesan structures, the final planning report
includes recommendations to form an archdiocesan board and
archdiocesan pastoral council to advise the archbishop; establish
the offices of vicar for parishes, vicar for clergy and consecrated
life, and vicar for ethnic and cultural ministries; elevate the
archdiocesan Catholic schools office to the vicar level;
restructure communications under a new Office of Communications and
Public Affairs; establish the office of a director of human
resources.
   Quinn began an archdiocese-wide consultation in early 1993 to
prepare the local church for the next millennium. Among factors
behind the planning was a new San Francisco ordinance requiring
that all public buildings built with unreinforced masonry --
including a number of the city's older Catholic churches -- be
reinforced to meet earthquake safety standards. Decisions made
earlier in the planning process called for the closing of some
churches but also for keeping several open that didn't meet the new
building standards. In August 1995 the archdiocese announced $6
million in grants to help five parishes be retrofitted to meet the
earthquake safety standards.
   Quinn announced last summer that he planned to retire in the
first part of 1996 and that he had a spring-term fellowship at
Oxford University in England and an appointment as centennial
lecturer at Oxford's Campion Hall. He said one reason he asked for
a coadjutor archbishop was to involve his successor in the
archdiocese's final planning stage.

   Auxiliary Bishop John Dunne of Rockville Centre, N.Y., new
chairman of the U.S. bishops' Committee on Women in Society and in
the Church, has named six bishops to serve on the committee. The
U.S. Catholic Conference announced that the committee also expects
to appoint women advisers after its first meeting, in March. Dunne
was elected head of the committee at the U.S. bishops' November
meeting in Washington. The new committee members are Bishops
Richard Hanifen of Colorado Springs, Colo., Howard Hubbard of
Albany, N.Y., and Joseph Gossman of Raleigh, N.C.; and Auxiliary
Bishops Gabino Zavala of Los Angeles, George Murry of Chicago and
William Newman of Baltimore. Among future committee projects are
ongoing studies of feminism and the ways women may exercise
leadership in the church, along with the publication of Pope John
Paul II's 1995 statements to and about women.

being undertaken by a joint venture between Baylite, an investment
company based in the British Virgin Islands, Indonesian company PT
Eterindo Anugerah Prakarsa, and Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals.

The joint venture is called PT Mitsui Eterindo Chemicals (MEC) and it
plans to construct a 10,000 tonnes/y facility at Serang, West Java.

MEC says the plant is scheduled onstream in Jul 1997 at an estimated
cost of $9.6 M.

About 50% of MEC's production will be sold on the domestic market and
the rest exported.

NPC-TOC merger may be scrapped

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemicalweek Asia, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 2, No. 19, Pg. 5

Plans for a merger between Thailand's National Petrochemical Co (NPC)
and Thai Olefins may be abandoned.

A decision is expected by the end of 1996.

Questions have been raised over the appropriateness of the merger,
since it may adversely affect the profitability of NPC.

State-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand, which has a 37% interest
in NPC and a 49% interest in Thai Olefins, first proposed the merger in
1H 1996.

In 1995 NPC recorded a net profit of Baht 420 M but Thai Olefins has
been recording losses since it started up in 1995.

Storage market heats up as regional demand rises

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemicalweek Asia, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 2, No. 19, Pg. 5

There is a broad diversity of storage tanks farms in Asia in terms of
size and distribution facilities.

As the region's chemical industry expands, a growing number of
companies are building up-to-date tank farms or are currently planning
their construction.

Singapore dominates the Southeast Asian storage market but there is
growing competition from Malaysia.

The tanks farms are needed not only to meet rapid trade demand but also
to supply the expanding domestic industry.

Major storage tanks companies operating in the region include GATX, Van
Ommeron, and Fimachem Sdn Bhd/ Fima Liquid Bulking.

Fima subscribes to Malaysia's Responsible Care programme.

Several new chemical tank farm projects are planned.

In addition, GATX and Petronas are planning a joint venture terminal at
the location of Petronas' worldscale petrochemical facility at Kertih.

GATX will hold a 30% interest in the venture with Petronas taking 40%.

The remaining 30% will be held by Malaysian Capital Ventures and
Dialog.

The Philippines: government steps up search for foreign investment

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemicalweek Asia, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 2, No. 19, Pg. 3

The Philippines Board of Investment is attempting to attract more
foreign investment into the country by holding talks with several major
chemical companies.

Chemicals have been identified as a priority industry by the
Philippines Ministry of Industrial Development.

In 1996 a consortium of Petrocorp, BPC, Itochu, BP Chemicals, Bataan
Polyethylene Holdings, PPDC, and Petron Corp have signed a memorandum
of understanding to undertake a $1 bn naphtha cracker project.

The Philippines wants to compete with Malaysia and Singapore for
foreign investment.

Singapore is planning its third olefins facility.

The country is looking to make its investment incentive scheme more
attractive than those of its rival neighbouring countries.

One possibility will be to offer industrial land at a 25% discount for
projects which are joint ventures with local companies.

A list of local companies which are major consumers of chemicals is
also being drawn up so that demand levels can be assessed so that a
ready market for investors can provided.

In the past investors have believed that the government has given
little support to the chemical industry and so have not shown much
interest.

But the government is now trying to improve its image and moves are
also underway to improve the country's development of its
infrastructure.

CPC shelves cracker relocation project

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemicalweek Asia, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 2, No. 19, Pg. 2

Plans to relocate Chinese Petroleum Corp's (CPC's) mothballed number 2
naphtha cracker to Indonesia have been dropped as a consequence of a
government freeze on state-owned CPC's foreign investments.

CPC's plans for a petrochemical area in Malaysia have also been
postponed.

The economics ministry of Taiwan has stopped all CPC's foreign projects
at the initial phase of development or included in the country's
stalled 1996- 1997 budget.

This is in order that the company can focus on domestic projects.

It is not expected that the facility will be restarted in Taiwan.

However, involvement in a refinery project in Vietnam will progress.

Philippines cracker scale up

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemicalweek Asia, 5 Nov 1996, Vol. 2, No. 19, Pg. 1

A large capacity plant has been recommended following a feasibility
study into the Philippines' first ethylene complex.

It is now anticipated that the capacity of the $500-600 M facility, to
be constructed in the industrial park at Mariveles, Bataan, will be
600,000 tonnes/y of ethylene and 300,000 tonnes/y of propylene.

The original plan was for 450,000 tonnes/y of ethylene.

Japanese interests have also proposed a second polyethylene plant for
the complex.

The Philippines Petrochemical Development Corp is also attempting to
bring in J G Summit to co- invest in the Mariveles cracker.

Local entrepreneur Antonio Garcia has a 33% interest in Petrocorp,
which is constructing the country's first polypropylene facility and is
a shareholder in Bataan Polyethylene Corp (BPC).

Garcia wants control of the cracker and wants PPDC to either reduce its
share or withdraw completely from the consortium.

Offtake arrangements from the cracker are at present being negotiated
by Petrocorp and BPC.

The cracker is scheduled for completion in 2000.

Front-end design is being conducted by BPC on its 200,000 tonnes/y
Innovene-process linear low-density polyethylene facility.

The second polyethylene facility would produce other grades.

Petrocorp has almost completed its polypropylene plant, which in 1Q
1997 will output 160,000 tonnes/y.

Capacity will be expanded almost immediately to 225,000 tonnes/y.

Members of the Mariveles cracker consortium are Petrocorp, BPC, Itochu,
BP Chemicals, PPDC, and Petron Corp.

About 33% of the naphtha requirement will be obtained from domestic
refineries and the rest will be imported by Itochu.

A 70,000 tonnes/y polyvinyl chloride facility will be constructed at
Mariveles by Mabuhay Vinyl, Tosoh, Bank of the Philippine Islands, and
Mitsubishi.

JG Summit is progressing with the building of Unipol process 200,000
tonnes/y polyethylene and 180,000 tonnes/y polypropylene units in
Batangas, south of Manila.

JG Summit also intends to construct a 500,000 tonnes/y ethylene unit in
Batangas.

EPA issues compliance assurance monitoring rule

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chemical Engineering Progress, Oct 1996, Vol. 92, No. 10, Pg. 32

The latest draft Compliance Assurance Monitoring regulation issued by
the EPA incorporates comments received on the 1995 draft and replaces
the enhanced monitoring regulation proposed in Sep 1993.

The current draft regulation defines the minimum applicable monitoring

11-12,14,16,18

The following are examples of new technologies using electrochemistry
for pollution prevention or reduction in industry.

Physical Sciences Inc, Andover, MA, has developed an electrochemical
synthetic method of producing hydrogen peroxide as an alternative to
chlorine for the pulp and paper industry.

It is based on a gas diffusion electrode formulation which has better
operating characteristics than the trickle bed technology developed by
Dow.

Long term tests are planned to determine the lifetime of the cathodes.

The company aims to have cathode lifetimes of the order of 1 year or
more.

Electrosynthesis Co has developed a 'salt-splitting process' to produce
caustic soda without the co-production of chlorine.

The process has been verified in a pilot plant in Saskatchewan.

A full scale plant is under construction at the same site.

The Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, has developed a more
environmentally friendly process for the electrochemical manufacture of
sodium hydrosulfite.

Olin Corp, the only major producer of electrochemically manufactured
sodium hydrosulfite has licensed the technology to Vulcan Materials Co
to be used in its Port Edwards, WI, facility for distribution to local
pulp and paper mills.

Farady Technology Inc, Dayton, OH, is developing a electrochemical
treatment system, together with Los Alamos National Laboratory, NM, to
simultaneously destroy several wastes in plant recycling streams.

The process has been successfully demonstrated at Los Alamos where 10
different wastes with radioactive and other hazardous waste products
were separated.

pharmaceuticals, coatings, food additives (Chinese demand for food
additives is expected to reach 1.5 M tonnes by 2000), feed additives,
paper making chemicals (demand of 300,000-500,000 tonnes expected by
2000), leather chemicals and water treatment chemicals to 2000.

Demand for automotive coatings is expected to rise to 100,000 by the
end of the decade and in the building industry water latex paints will
account for 60% of the total output of buildings coatings.

Increased demand is also expected from the information industry.

Research and development to expand raw material sources is also

Polyaspartic acids

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Chimica Oggi, Sep 1996, Vol. 14, No. 9, Pg. 54

Bayer has developed a cost-effective process for producing polyaspartic
acids (PAAs) directly from maleic anhydride.

PAAs are good substitutes for polycarboxylates in circumstances where
biodegradability is important.

PAAs are good dispersing and sequestering agents and are therefore
useful in preventing sedimentation in aqueous dispersions and slurries.

They suppress the formation of deposits in cooling circuits and in
boiler and feed water treatment.

PAAs are also suitable for use as dispersing and softening agents in
detergents.

The polyaspartic acids will be supplied as salts in aqueous solution.

A pilot plant of 2000 tonnes capacity will be built within 1997-1998.

market.

Asian MEG demand is approximately 3 M tonnes/y, 50% produced in Asia
and 50% imported from the West or Saudi Arabia.

Original text in SWEDISH

AGA is reducing its results forecast for 1996 to 15% less than that of
1995, which means around SKR 1.8 bn.

The company reported a turnover of SKR 9523 M in 1-3Q 1996, 5% down on

The downturn was attributed to the stronger Swedish krona and also the
fact that AGA is expanding at a time of weak economic development in
several countries in Europe and Latin America.

The company invested nearly SKR 2.1 bn in new facilities over the
period Jan-Sep 1996, equivalent to 22% of sales, while a number of

Pressure on prices reduces Nycomed's profits in 1-3Q 1996

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Dagens Industri, 1 Nov 1996, Vol. 21, No. 235, Pg. 43

Original text in SWEDISH

In 1-3Q 1996 Nycomed reported pretax results of NKR 898 M, less than
the NKR 1321 M in 1-3Q 1995 and less than analysts' forecast of NKR 914
M.

The fall in profits was attributed to a strong pressure on prices.

Total sales of the contrast media Omnipaque, Imagopaque, and Visipaque
in Europe and other markets outside N America were, however, up 11%,
though it is thought that continuing pressure on the prices of these
products in the US will affect results for the remainder of 1996.

The company's newly launched Fokus 98 programme will lead to
restructuring costs of NKR 700 M in 4Q 1996.

The programme should lead to cost reductions of NKR 600 M/y by 1998.

In 1-3Q 1996 Pharmacia and Upjohn reported a 1% increase in turnover to
SKR 35,145 M but a 52% drop in pretax results to SKR 3325 M.

Soon afterwards there was a SKR 14 bn collapse in the company's share

Pharmacia and Upjohn's current restructuring programme is predicted to
achieve cost cuts of $500 M/y, 85% of which will be accomplished during
1997.

The biggest savings will come from personnel reductions, which have
been revised upwards from 2750 to 3300.

AGA Sweden's fourth largest Swedish pharmaceutical firm

Original text in SWEDISH

The Swedish gases company AGA could also be seen to be that country's
fourth largest pharmaceuticals firm, with its Pharma medicines business
group having turnover of SKR 1.7 bn.

AGA hopes that its oxygen and nitrous oxide, which it supplies on a
large scale to hospitals, will be classified as pharmaceuticals.

Nitrous oxide, which is sold by Pharma, can be administered to patients
with serious lung damage, where it opens the injured part of the lung
and secures the acid balance in the blood.

It has been approved as a pharmaceutical in only a few countries,
though it is being used on a trial basis in a number of hospitals.

AGA wants to obtain a European patent for this method and also thinks
that nitrous oxide treatment can expanded to other types of patients.

An overview is presented of Swedish rubber and plastic companies,
including Nolato, which in summer 1996 signed a declaration of intent
to take over Ericsson's plastics plant at Kristianstad, and which in
1995 achieved a turnover of SKR 771 M (SKR 90 M in 1994) and a profit
of SKR 104 M (SKR 80 M).

Nolato is seen as an attractive takeover candidate, though the firm
says it is not interested in selling.

Trelleborg, which now owns Horda and Vaernamo Gummi in Sweden's
so-called rubber belt, aims to double the turnover of its rubber
division from the SKR 4.4 bn reported in 1995, and this could well be
achieved in 1996.

Trelleborg says it is not interested in acquiring another Swedish
rubber company.

Gislaved reported a profit of SKR 49 M in 1995, with a turnover of SKR
293 M.

The French insecticide market saw an increase in activity in 1996
following several years of low insect infestation.

Growers have responded to the rise in insect attack by sowing Gaucho

A rise in the incidence of moths has resulted in a 6-10 fold increase
in pyrethroids.

The market leaders are the multi-purpose products Decis and Karate.

Maize herbicides: the end of an era

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Circuits Culture, Oct 1996, No. Hors serie, Pg. 18,20

Original text in FRENCH

Little change is expected in the strategies employed by French maize
growers in 1997.

However, the market is likely to alter radically with the arrival of
genetically modified varieties and the withdrawal of older active
ingredients.

Compounds which could possibly be withdrawn include dinoterb, atrazine,
alachlor, pendimethalin, bromoxynil and pyridate.

This is unlikely to happen before the year 2000.

Weed control has become a much more pressing problem for growers in
some areas of SW France.

This has led to an increase in the use of graminicides for both pre-
and post-emergence treatments.

Cyanamid is to actively promote pendimethalin in 1997.

Monsanto has abandoned its Toptech formulation of Lasso in favour of
Microtech.

Ciba is putting particular emphasis on the use of Safener.

which currently stands at 650 tonnes/y, is set to rise to 3500 tonnes/y
by 2000.

Current demand for isophthalic acid is 8000 tonnes/y using 5500 tonnes
of m-xylene.

By 2000 consumption of around 12,000 tonnes/y is expected with the use
of 8000 tonnes/y of m-xylene.

Chinese consumption of 2,4-xylidine in the production of amitraz and
danjiami, which currently stands at 700 tonnes/y, is predicted to rise
to 4000 tonnes.

Use of 2,4-xylidine in the production of dyes is 400 tonnes/y.

Demand for 2,6-xylidine for the production of fungicide metalaxyl is
500 tonnes/y and in the production of pharmaceutical ledocain and
xylidinothiazoline is 200 tonnes/y.

Around 2000 tonnes of high purity m-xylene is currently required to
meet the demand for 1800 tonnes/y of 2,4 and 2,6 xylidine.

By 2000 around 5500 tonnes of high purity m-xylene will be required to
meet the demand for 5000 tonnes/y of 2,4 and 2,6-xylene.

a softening effect on the hair.

Both molecules contain a hydroxyethyl group, giving them greater water
dispersibility than normal quaternaries.

They are also biodegradable since both are based on vegetable oils.

PEI and hair care

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Drug and Cosmetic Industry (DCI), Aug 1996, Vol. 159, No. 2, Pg. 55

Summit Specialty Chemical Corp and Polymer Enterprises Inc have formed
an alliance to provide technical and marketing services for
polyethylenimine (PEI).

PEI is a branched aliphatic polyamine that possesses high cationic
charge density and the ability to enhance the binding efficiency of
nonsubstantive materials to a large number of substrates via surface
charge interactions.

It can be used as a levelling agent before shampooing or chemical
treatment as it binds to keratin through charge attachment to anionic
sites on the hair.

It binds to damaged areas first as theses have a higher localised
negative charge.

PEI is removed from the shaft of the hair during shampooing but it
remains in the cracks and damaged areas.

PEI's overall effect is to equalise the charge density of the hair.

Low VOC levels without compromising quality

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Drug and Cosmetic Industry (DCI), Aug 1996, Vol. 159, No. 2, Pg. 55

A superior performance fixative for low VOC applications, Lovocryl-47,
has been introduced by National Starch and Chemical.

Lovocryl-47 is a hydrophobically-modified acrylic polymer that was
formulated for use in low VOC pump and aerosol hair sprays, setting
lotions and water-containing mousses.

It overcomes the effects of water in a broad range of hair spray VOC
contents and produces extremely low solution viscosity.

Very fine atomization is therefore achievable, even at high solids
levels.

Sweet almond derivative helps produce healthy hair

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Drug and Cosmetic Industry (DCI), Aug 1996, Vol. 159, No. 2, Pg. 55

A new cosmetic active ingredient obtained from sweet almonds has been
launched by RITA Corp.

The ingredient, Amanduline SG is a molecular system that is rich in
oligosaccharides and charged peptides that boost its affinity for
hydrophobic protein, including keratin.

The material is claimed to be effective in strengthening damaged hair
and protecting from environmental damage.

The charged almond peptides bind to weakened areas of the hair and the
branched and integrated chains and peptides form a network which
spreads over the surface of the hair, forming a continuous film.

Ref: Drug and Cosmetic Industry (DCI), Aug 1996, Vol. 159, No. 2, Pg. 22-26

Alberto-Culver has been successful since its foundation in 1955 due to
innovation and aggressive marketing.

In 1995 the company made a pretax profit of $84.2 M on sales of $1.36
bn.

Continual development of the Alberto VO5 Hairdressing range has meant
that after 40 years on the market, it is still in the top 5% of all
health and beauty products and its market share continues to grow.

In Feb 1996, the company acquired St Ives Laboratories in Chatsworth,
CA.

St Ives produces the Swiss formula range of skin and hair care
products.

The combination of the 2 companies will have domestic packaged goods
sales of over $400 M and international packaged goods sales of over
$500 M.

Alberto-Culver's sales should be raised to $1.6 bn/y as a result of the
deal.

In 3Q 1996 Nycomed reported an operating income of NKR 5749 M, 7% down

The main reason for the downturn was a 23% fall in the price of
contrast agents in the US since 1 Jan 1996, with sales volumes also
down by 2%.

To cope with even stiffer competition Nycomed has launched its Fokus-98
programme which should result in a reduction in costs of NKR 600 M/y by

The biggest savings will come in the area of research and development,
where expenditure will be cut by NKR 180 M/y (19%), while production
costs will be brought down by NKR 150-170 M/y (12%) and sales and
marketing costs by NKR 110-140 M (8%).

Original text in NORWEGIAN

Axis Biochemicals is entering into an agreement with Boehringer
Mannheim which could double its turnover many times over.

The deal involves the German firm acquiring Axis' technology for the
measurement of glycohaemoglobin in return for royalty payments on 6% of
sales.

The test acts as a more stable alternative to conventional tests of
blood sugar levels for diabetics, the market for which is currently NKR
600 M.

Its launch should take place in a little over 2 years.

When the technology is adapted to Boehringer Mannheim's analysis
apparatus it will enable it to win a major share of the total market
for such tests, of which Boehringer Mannheim has a 35% share.

This will mean royalties of around NKR 40 M/y for Axis Biochemicals.

the supply of 25% of the Czech Republic's gas consumption over the next

with Russia in 1998 over a reform of the existing long term supply
agreement.

It is thought that Russia will always be the Czechs' major supplier and
that the deal could therefore provoke Gazprom, Russia, which has
hitherto had a monopoly of supply to the Czech Republic, into raising
prices for the next long term contract.

Transgas had also shown itself willing to pay up to 20% more for the
Norwegian gas.

The Czech authorities will consider 3 alternative proposals: Russia
maintains its 100% supply; Russia supplies the natural gas but via
Gasunie, Netherlands, and Wintershall, Germany; Norwegian and Dutch gas
is supplied through a number of W European and US distribution
companies.

Statoil shows interest in Turkish privatizations

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Dagens Naeringsliv, 29 Oct 1996, Vol. 107, No. 251, Pg. 14

Original text in NORWEGIAN

Statoil is considering making acquisitions in Turkey, where a series of
privatizations will be carried out in 1997, with state-owned oil and
petrochemical companies on top of the sales list.

However, the company does not have any concrete plans as yet.

Takeovers present an opportunity to enter the Turkish market, which
though very well established has hitherto been difficult to gain access
to.

Sabic has given the go-ahead to a 500,000 tonnes/y styrene plant at Al
Jubail, Saudi Arabia, which will be constructed jointly by its
wholly-owned affiliate, Petrokemya, and Sadaf.

Sadaf is a 50:50 joint venture between Shell and Sabic.

Petrokemya produces PS at the site and Sadaf has an existing 460,000
tonnes/y styrene unit at Al Jubail.

Both groups have existing ethylene capacity, whilst benzene will be
available from a 50:50 joint venture between Saudi Industrial Venture
Capital Group (SIVCG) and Chevron Chemical.

The venture is building a 480,000 tonnes/y benzene unit.

Sabic has also approved a number of other petrochemical projects in the
country.

Petrokemya is to build a world-scale olefins complex that will
incorporate 275,000 tonnes/y of propylene and 800,000 tonnes/y of
ethylene.

Sharq is to invest in a 450,000 tonnes/y ethylene glycol unit.

It will also debottleneck capacity for LLDPE by 300,000 tonnes/y using
technology from Union Carbide.

Both projects are in Al Jubail.

Yanpet is to add a second 830,000 tonnes/y cracker to its site at
Yanbu.

It will also build downstream units, including 535,000 tonnes/y of PE,
260,000 tonnes/y of PP and 410,000 tonnes/y of MEG.

Project management is being undertaken by Lummus Global.

The entire project will cost $2 bn.

Kemya is discussing the possibility of building a third cracker and PE
project.

Plans are thought to include 200,000 tonnes/y of LDPE and 700,000
tonnes/y of ethylene.

Aga, Sweden, and Ohmeda, the healthcare branch of BOC, are to
collaborate on research into the use of nitric oxide (NO) for treating
lung diseases.

The collaboration will focus on phase III trials for treating Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxic respiratory failure in
new born babies.

NO is found naturally in the body, where it has a relaxing effect on
blood vessels, increasing the flow of blood.

It is known to have a short-term effect on patients, but the long-term
benefits are unknown.

The 2 companies have signed a licensing agreement with the
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston which was granted a patent in
1990 for work it undertook on NO in the 1980s.

The US courts have dismissed a lawsuit taken out by the Schering

Administration over Biogen's drug, Avonex (interferon beta-1a), which
is used to treat multiple sclerosis.

Berlex had alleged that the FDA's approval of Avonex was improper. the
court has found that the FDA acted lawfully when it claimed that
Berlex's Betaseron was clinically inferior to Avonex under the terms of
the orphan drug law and that the FDA's ruling that Avonex is potent,
pure and safe is well supported by the records.

Both companies are still involved in a dispute over a patent for

Award for Chiroscience single isomer research

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 27

Research and development work at Chiroscience has discovered a new
crystallisation method that may be applied to chiral resolution, giving
cheaper technology for manufacturing single isomers.

The researchers found that crystallisation of certain racemates occurs
by oscillation of the enantiomeric composition.

The new process will allow crystallisation processes to be stopped at
the precise point when an appropriate isomer has crystallised, allowing
separation from its mirror image isomer.

The work was undertaken on bicyclic lactam.

Production of this molecule is usually effected by biocatalytic
resolution of the racemate.

The work has received an Industrial Innovation Team Award from the UK's
Royal Society of Chemistry.

Zinc oxide: greater UV block for creams and coatings

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 25

Durham Chemicals, part of the Harcros Chemical Group, has developed a
new grade of zinc oxide, called Nanox, which will be used in varnishes
and sun-blocking creams.

The zinc oxide has been manufactured in very small particle sizes and
is transparent when used in creams.

This innovation allows higher concentrations of the zinc oxide in
creams than existing sunblocks.

Durham is also investigating the use of the zinc oxide in paints and
coatings, as wood undergoes a degree of degradation in UV light.

The company has also started up a 3000 tonnes/y plant at Birtley, UK,
to manufacture its Activox catalysts.

The zinc oxide catalysts are used in the production of rubber and in
desulfurisation.

Criterion Catalysts, US, claims it has made a breakthrough in catalyst
technology with its nickel-molybdenum hydrotreating catalyst.

It will be produced at a $10 M, 4540 tonnes/y plant at Michigan City,
IN, which is scheduled to start up in 1997.

Full production will be achieved in early 1998.

The new catalyst allows extra hydrodenitrification and polynuclear
aromatics separation in cat feed, high-pressure hydrotreaters.

The new catalysts have been undergoing tests with refining companies
and one is expected to install a commercially produced catalyst system
in 1996.

Criterion's catalyst regeneration subsidiary, Catalyst Recovery, has
raised the capacity of its catalyst recycling plant at Lafayette, LA,
by 30-40%.

The expansion includes the installation of the OptiCAT-plus process and
it is expected to start up in mid 1997.

The process uses fluidised pre-treatment to control the elevated
initial exotherms found in regeneration, followed by a moderate heat
soak to eliminate sulfur and carbon for the catalyst.

The company is also raising its alumina powder capacity at Michigan
City by 15% and its catalyst extrudate capacity at Pittsburgh, CA, site
by 30%.

The alumina powder expansion will be completed in 1997 at a cost of $18
M.

or not.

The company expects insurers to honour their contractual obligations to
pay for the clean up of groundwater and off-site remediation.

The UK chemical distribution trade association, BCDTA, claims that
although Responsible Care figures show a drop in the number of
accidents, results should be interpreted cautiously.

Accidents fell 32% in 1995 to 1121 lost-time accidents for every
100,000 employees.

Dangerous transport incidents, defined as those that required the help
of emergency services or which involved dangerous substances, fell to
28 from 34 in 1994.

This is equivalent to 1 accident for every 27,027 deliveries made.

In 1995, the industry transported 53,000 tonnes of special waste (toxic
chemicals), of which 24,466 tonnes was recycled.

Controlled waste transport fell from 36,312 tonnes in 1994 to 34,681
tonnes in 1995.

Procter and Gamble is facing prosecution over a pollution incident in
Ireland that has left the town of Nenagh, County Tipperary, without
drinking water for 4 months.

Residents have relied on supplies of drinking water brought in by
tanker since siloxanes were discovered in the town's mains water
supply.

A second borehole has also been found to be contaminated, and there are
now concerns that the entire water table may be unfit to drink.

Samples from a third borehole are currently being examined.

The Irish Environmental Protection Agency has blamed the pollution on
the local Procter and Gamble plant and has initiated legal action.

Procter and Gamble is disputing the charge and claims that the
contamination resulted from a fouled drain which was the responsibility
of Shannon Development.

The plant's process effluent was discharged into the drain with the
consent of the local authority.

One of Procter and Gamble's suppliers, the plastic packaging company,
Tubex, will also be prosecuted as well as Procter and Gamble and

Petrochemical revenue for Jan-Sep 1996 was NKR 4.08 bn compared to NKR
4.84 bn in Jan-Sep 1995.

The rapid drop in prices for VCM and PVC has been blamed for the
decline.

For the Hydro Group overall, sales in 3Q 1996 were NKR 20.173 bn and
operating earnings were NKR 2.150 bn.

Profits fell to NKR 909 M from NKR 1.6 bn in 3Q 1995.

US companies see growth strengthening

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 19

Chemical companies in the US had to struggle in Jan-Sep 1996 to match
the financial performance of Jan-Sep 1995.

There was however a recovery in 3Q 1996 and this is forecast to
strengthen in 4Q 1996.

A similar pattern emerged in Europe.

A table gives details of the sales and pretax profits of 17 chemical
companies in the US for Jan-Sep 1996.

The highest sales and pretax profit of the 17 companies in Jan-Sep 1996
was achieved by PPG at $5464 M and $985 M respectively.

The table does not include figures for Dow or DuPont, as the results
have not yet been published.

Details of individual company performances are given, including reasons
for improvements or declines in results.

UK ammonium nitrate prices stall

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 11

Reduced demand for ammonium nitrate in the UK and high imports from
Russia may put prices under pressure.

Spot prices from UK producers are put at #132-135/tonne and
#122-125/tonne for imported material.

At the same time in 1995, spot prices were #115-120/tonne.

The target price of #150/tonne for spring 1997 is not expected to be
met. the French market for ammonium nitrate is flat, but prices are 10%
higher than in the UK.

Imports of ammonium nitrate into the UK from Russia, Lithuania and
eastern Europe have risen 54% to 733,000 tonnes in 1995-1996 compared
to 1994-1995.

Imports from Russia doubled from 152,000 tonnes to 398,000 tonnes.

Imports from other countries have fallen from 349,000 tonnes in
1994-1995 to 298,000 tonnes in 1995-1996.

Polycarbonate growth rates set to fall away to 5%

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 10

The double digit growth rates for polycarbonates experienced in Europe
in the last few years are expected to decline to 5% in 1996.

Underlying growth is however put at 10%/y and the outlook for 1997 is
good. demand for PC for use in the production of extruded sheets for
the building industry is lower than expected and demand from the
compact disc industry has been lower in 1996 than in 1995.

Both these sectors have seen a price drop of 40-50 pfg/kg.

Injection moulding prices have fallen by 10-20 pfg/kg despite growth in
demand of 5%/y.

Upstream, the price of bisphenol A for 4Q 1996 contracts in Europe has
rolled over from 3Q 1996 at DM 2.00-2.20/kg FD and phenol prices have
been set at DM 1150-1250/kg FD.

Phenol supplies will loosen in mid 1997 when Phenolchemie starts up its
200,000 tonnes/y plant at Antwerp, Belgium.

Para-xylene manufacturers are facing a bleak future in the next 2-3
years, especially in Europe.

There are 11 producers in Europe, with an average capacity of 135,000
tonnes/y.

A further round of restructuring is anticipated, with the smaller
producers being particularly vulnerable.

Prices for para-xylene are forecast to stay in the range 17-19 cents/lb
until at least 1998.

New PTA capacity will keep a cap on PTA prices, thus restraining
para-xylene prices.

Para-xylene producers in the US have the benefit of economies of scale
compared to European producers.

Seven independent manufacturers in the US have an average capacity of
445,000 tonnes/y.

Asia is increasing its para-xylene capacity as part of a move to
greater downstream integration.

Poland's productivity breaks pre-reform levels

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1738, Pg. 8

The Polish chemical association, PIPC, claims that the country's
chemical output is exceeding pre-economic transition levels for the
first time.

Output in 1995 was up 2% on 1989, the year that Poland started economic
reforms.

However, production of fertilizers, drugs, fibres and crude oil
processing products are still less than in 1989.

Poland's imports of chemicals still exceed exports by $3 bn.

Since 1992, Poland's negative trade balance has grown, with imports
reaching $5.23 bn in 1995, compared to exports of $2.3 bn.

There is scope for improvement.

Poland's output of plastics rose 9.8% in 1995, but production did not
meet demand.

This resulted in the need to import $2 bn worth of plastics.

This situation could be remedied by investing in a new refinery and
petrochemicals complex.

Poland's exports to EU member countries amounted to $1.27 bn in 1995,
whilst it imported $3.65 M worth of chemical products from the EU.

Its exports to the former Soviet Union amounted to $439.3 M whereas
imports amounted to $302.4 M.

PIPC has criticised the lack of foreign investment in Poland, despite
its cheap and skilled workforce and developed infrastructure.

segments of the chemical sector, such as tyres and soda ash.

Direct foreign investments are being encouraged in fertilizers,
synthetic materials, ethylene and fine chemicals via wholly-owned or

In the past decade, there have been 5450 ventures set up in China with
foreign investment, involving $2 bn in direct investments.

China is planning to list several enterprises on overseas stock markets
to raise funds for priority operations.

Federchimica, the Italian chemical industry association, claims that
Italian chemical output will only rise 0.8% over 1995 levels.

The rise will only be 2% if drugs are included.

Growth of not more than 2% is also forecast for 1997, with the bulk of
this being down to exports.

The strength of the lira an poor prices will prevent Italy from
benefiting from strong growth in the global chemical sector.

The Italian chemical industry is out of step with the rest of the
European chemical sector due to the prevailing recession.

Exports will not grow by more than 4% in 1997 and domestic demand will
rise 1.5-2%.

Depressed prices will result in a 1.3% drop in sales to ITL 82 trillion
in 1996.

Exports in 1996 are expected to grow by 3.5% or 4.5% if drugs are
included.

The chemical sector's balance of trade is put at ITL 12 trillion in

#665 M compared to #569 M in 3Q 1995.

Earnings in 3Q 1996 were #57 M (#32 M).

However, this good result failed to counteract the poor performance of
industrial chemicals which saw a drop in sales in 3Q 1996 to #954 M
from #1010 M.

The industrial chemicals division recorded no earnings in 3Q 1996
compared to #124 M in 3Q 1995.

Overall, ICI's sales in 3Q 1996 rose 1.8% to #2668 M (#2622 M) and its
earnings fell to #147 M (#260 M).

Pretax profits in 3Q 1996 totalled #131 M (up 47%).

The company cites the competitive climate in the worldwide chemicals
industry for the decline.

Industrial chemicals were under pressure from reduced selling prices
for chlorine, titanium dioxide and polyesters.

The good performance of the paints sector was attributed to strong
growth in retail sector and Asia.

The explosives division doubled its profits in 3Q 1996.

Weak PTA leads Interquisa to stay with PIA

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 11

Production of purified isophthalic acid (PIA) is to be continued by
Interquisa at its San Roque facility.

One of the company's three purified terephthalic acid (PTA) lines will
be devoted to PIA production because of slow demand for PTA.

Total PTA capacity at the site is 400,000 tonne/y.

Availability of meta-xylene feedstock will limit output of PIA.

A small increase in demand for polyester is understood to have led
Amoco to switch some PIA production at Geel, Belgium, to PTA.

In 4Q 1996, European prices for 2-ethylhexanol have fallen sharply in
the face of stronger Middle East competition and new capacity coming
onstream in the Far East.

Samad is experiencing problems with production at its facility in Saudi
Arabia, and is expected to export only 15,000 tonnes of 2-ethylhexanol
in 1H 1996.

The unit is understood to have been closed for 10 days at the end of

2-ethylhexanol capacity is due to be brought onstream in South Korea by
Lucky in 3Q 1996.

This will increase its capacity to 220,000 tonne/y.

Further projects in Asia include 90,000 tonne/y capacity to be brought
onstream in South Korea by Hanwha in 4Q 1998, when Nan Ya is also due
to startup 150,000 tonne/y of capacity in Taiwan.

On 26-27 Oct 1996, production at Lonza's 50,000 tonne/y maleic
anhydride facility at Ravenna was halted by mechanical failure.

It will be at least 10 days before production can be restarted.

The reduced supply has led to improved prices, but a further increase
is required to give producers a return on investment.

Lonza is awaiting approval to build additional capacity amounting to
50,000 tonne/y at Schkopau and Meerbeck.

A joint venture between Huntsman and Condea is planning to build a new
40,000 tonne/y facility in Germany.

This is due to begin production in late 1998.

Demand in the US is stronger than usual and exports to Europe are

The government is being pressured by an increasing number of groups
which are against the sale of its 49% stake in the company.

The stake is to be sold on the Mexican stock exchange, and this is now
unlikely to happen before 1997.

Foreign companies are being prevented from acquiring a majority stake
in Mexican companies.

Shell and Norsk Hydro are understood to have a continued interest in
acquiring minority stakes.

Shareholder pressure: new bid for Rexene

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 4

A 7% stake in Rexene has been acquired by a group called Rexene
Investors.

The stake is worth $16 M.

The group is to seek to remove the current Rexene board through a
special shareholders' meeting.

There was a 30% drop in operating income in 3Q 1996 to $18.3 M, and
sales were slightly down at $150 M.

This poor performance is part of the reason for the shareholders'
dissatisfaction.

In Aug 1996, Rexene rejected a takeover bid from Huntsman.

This has resulted in a number of lawsuits being filed by shareholders
which accuse the board of not making sufficient consideration of the
offer.

Plastic film, styrene, polyethylene, amorphous polyalphaolefin and
propylene are the company's major products.

Petrochemicals: Teesside denied new North Sea feedstocks

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 4

In the UK, the Department of Trade has decided not to oppose plans by
Elf and Shell to bring dry natural gas ashore at Bacton, East Anglia.

BP will receive oil and gas liquids from the offshore fields at
Grangemouth, beginning in 2000.

The company claims that the additional feedstocks are required for its
planned 500,000 tonne/y expansion to ethylene capacity at the site and
its planned production there of polyethylene and polypropylene.

Investment at the site is planned at #500 M, but the expansion projects
still require approval.

Petrochemical producers on Teesside were hoping to secure the new
feedstocks in order to attract new investment to the area.

Elf and Shell have agreed to make a future connection to Teesside after
2000, but the Teesside Chemicals Initiative does not believe this will
result in adequate supplied.

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 32

Proposals are being put forward by the UK Environmental Agency for

This would monitor the entire effluent for overall toxicity and would
be used in conjunction with current measures for monitoring discharge
of particular chemicals.

Maximum allowable discharge limits are based on the Environmental
Quality Standard (EQS) set for specific chemicals.

However, EQSs have only be established for less than 0.1% of listed
chemicals.

Companies would be required to take remedial action if their waste
stream was shown to be toxic under DTA.

Publication of the final proposals is due in mid 1997.

C5s contain pot of gold: consultant's analysis

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 24,26

High-value added derivatives can be obtained from the C5 hydrocarbon
stream although their production is not always easy.

Details are given of the processes for production of isoprene (2-
methyl-butadiene), cyclopentadiene (usually produced as
dicyclopentadiene, DCPD), piperylene (trans- and cis-1,3- pentadiene)
and 2-methyl-butene-2 (2MB2).

In 1994, combined consumption of these distillates was more than 1 M
tonnes, and this is expected to rise by an average 4.3%/y to more than
1.5 M tonne/y by 2005.

Isoprene rubber is the major end-use for isoprene, global demand for
which was 566,000 tonnes in 1995.

Styrene-isoprene block copolymers (SBCs) offer the greatest potential
increase in demand for isoprene, and by 2005, this could reach 840,000
tonne/y. 10% of isoprene demand is for production of butyl rubber and
this could increase if natural rubber becomes in short supply.

In 1995, demand for DCPD totalled 271,000 tonne/y, of which 50% was
used for production of hydrocarbon resins. 19% was used for production
of unsaturated polyester resins, and 11% for ethylidene norbornene
production.

To 2005, demand for high-purity DCPD for production of cyclic olefin
copolymers is expected to rise.

If production of this and other new DCPD derivatives increases, global
demand for DCPD could be more than 460,000 tonne/y by 2005.

In 1995, piperylene consumption was 134,000 tonnes worldwide, with an
increase to 180,000 tonne/y forecast to 2005.

For 2MB2, demand is forecast to rise from 34,000 tonne/y in 1995 to
41,000 tonne/y in 2005.

In 1995, the effective capacity for isoprene production worldwide was
983,000 tonne/y, with that for DCPD at 322,000 tonne/y and for
piperylene at 147,000 tonne/y. 49% of the world production of isoprene
is from the former Soviet Union.

The major DCPD producers and consumers are Japan and the US.

Pie charts indicate the regional production of isoprene, DCPD and
piperylene in 1995.

As military spending is reduced, SNPE has expanded its chemicals
operations and in 1996 they are expected to record sales of FFR 2 bn,
accounting for 45% of the company's turnover.

There was a 16% increase in chemicals sales in 1H 1996 to FFR 991 M,
accounting for 44.9% of the overall turnover in the period.

Over the next five years, SNPE anticipates average growth of 15%/y,
increasing the proportion of sales from the chemical sector to 50-60%
of the total.

The largest chemical sector is intermediates and agrochemicals, with
sales of FFR 1 bn/y in 1996.

Capital investment plans are for FFR 1 bn, mainly for overseas
expansion projects.

The company has based its expansion on its technical expertise in
nitration and phosgenation to produce intermediates for
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and plastics.

It has a close relationship with Rhone-Poulenc, and two phosgene
derivatives facilities with a combined capacity of 20-50 tonne/day are
being built in Institute, WV, at a cost of $45 M, as a joint venture
between the two companies.

Production of derivatives such as isocyanates, carbonates,
chloroformates and acid chlorides is due to begin in mid 1998.

Framochem is a 60:40 joint venture between SNPE and Borsodchem in
Hungary.

The company has sales of FFR 70 M/y.

FFR 25 M has been invested to modernise the fine chemicals facilities
at Kazincbarcika, and over the next three years a further FFR 30 M is
to be spent at the facility.

SNPE holds a 30% share of the global market for nitrocellulose, with
sales of FFR 550 M.

It has formed a joint venture in Hong Kong with TNC, Taiwan.

Through China NitroCellulose, SNPE has gained two small nitrocellulose
units in China, at Xin Xiang and Shanghai.

Their combined capacity is 15,000 tonne/y.

Sales of fine chemicals are FFR 450 M/y.

A production facility is being planned in the US, which may be a joint
venture with a pharmaceutical company.

A table gives details, for 1993-1995, of SNPE's sales, pretax income,
net income, capital expenditure and research and development as a
percentage of sales.

A breakdown of sales by division for 1995 is also given.

In 3Q 1996, pretax profits reported by Monsanto were $231 M compared
with $203 M in 3Q 1995.

Sales rose from $2.05 bn to $2.17 bn.

There was an increase in pretax income in Jan-Sep 1996 to $795 M
compared with $659 M in the previous year, and sales rose from $6.8 bn
to $7.1 bn.

Sales of agricultural products rose from $464 M to $613 M in 3Q, with
particularly good sales of the herbicide Roundup in Latin America and
Europe.

Rhone-Poulenc earnings increase as divestment plans progress

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 18

Net earnings by Rhone-Poulenc in 3Q 1996 were 13% higher at FFR 756 M.

Growth would have been 25.1% if the charge of FFR 81 M taken in the
period because of the recall of albumin products by Centeon in Oct.

In 4Q, the company will take a further charge which has not yet been
specified.There was a 4.7% increase in net sales in 3Q to FFR 20.5 bn.

For Jan-Sep, sales rose 1.9% to FFR 63.7 bn, with net profits 10.5%
higher at FFR 2.2 bn.

In 1995, net profits were FFR 2.1 bn and this is expected to be
exceeded in 1996.

There was little change in sales of chemicals in the nine months, but
those of the health sector rose 6.4% and agrochemical sales were 7.5%
higher.

Although volume sales of fibres and polymers rose, turnover was down
8.2% and operating profits fell 65.3%.

This poor sectorial performance contributed to the disappointing
operating profits which rose only 9.6% in the nine months to FFR 6.4
bn.

By the end of 1997, the company plans to divest non-strategic assets
worth FFR 10 bn.

To Sep 1996, such divestments have totalled FFR 6 bn.

By the end of 1996, this could increase to FFR 7-9 bn.

Michelin seals Taurus buyout

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 3

The purchase of a 90% stake in Taurus Rubber Co of Hungary by Groupe
Michelin has been completed.

The other 10% is held by Taurus employees.

The price was the equivalent of $66 M in cash and debt assumption, and
Michelin has agreed to invest a further $60 M in updating production
facilities.

Taurus was previously state-owned.

In a separate deal, Michelin then sold Taurus' non-tyre activities to
the German company Phoenix AG.

These businesses have a turnover of more than $32.5 M, and employ 1085.

Turnover is expected to rise by 20% in 1996.

They are known as Taurus Emerge Rubber Industrial Ltd, which makes
conveyer belts and industrial hoses, and Taurus Palma Ltd (expansion
joints, bellows, etc.).

Michelin is thus left with a truck tyre plant in Budapest and an
agricultural tyres plant in Nyireghyhaza, plus minor trading operations
that include a rubber goods company, a calendering company, a carbon
black distributor, a rubber processing equipment company, a joint
venture company making hose, belt and patch materials, and joint
venture company making dipped latex products in Vietnam.

Taurus made sales of $148 M in 1995, of which 71% was tyre-related.

The profit was $4.4 M.

Its truck tyres have a good presence in E Europe, and its agricultural
tyres are known throughout Europe.

PVC complex: Shintech Baton Rouge site gets green light

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 36

In mid 1998, a new $700 M integrated PVC complex is due to be completed
by Shin-Etsu Chemical's US subsidiary, Shintech.

It will be located at Baton Rouge, LA.

Chlorine production capacity will be 490,000 tonne/y, with that of
caustic soda at 550,000 tonne/y, with 500,000 tonne/y each of vinyl
chloride and PVC.

If demand rises, PVC capacity can be doubled to 1 M tonne/y.

Capacity for vinyl chloride and chlor alkalis would be raised
proportionately.

Dow Chemical will continue to supply vinyl chloride to the site by
pipeline after the new facilities come onstream.

Abate is a new process which produces methane from landfill gas for use
as a fuel has been developed by Dow.

The hydrogen sulfide is converted to elemental sulfur using an iron
chelate solution.

Sulfur production can be up to 227 kg/day, making it cost-effective at
lower rates than existing technologies.

Polyaspartic acids: new PAA route from Bayer

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Chemical News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 66, No. 1739, Pg. 35

Within two years, a 2000 tonne/y facility is planned by Bayer for
production of polyaspartic acids using its new technology.

A 300 tonne/y laboratory scale unit has been built at Leverkusen, where
the new unit is also expected to be based.

Eventually, the company plans to build a 25,000-30,000 tonne/y
commercial facility.

Bayer's process involves the reaction of maleic anhydride and ammonia.

New technology, based on the polymerisation of aspartic acid, is being
jointly developed by Donlar, and Rohm and Haas.

Polyaspartic acids are used as sequestering and dispersing agents in
slurries and aqueous dispersions, and can prevent deposits building up
in boilers and cooling circuits.

Detergents used in extraction of petroleum can be softened and
dispersed using polyaspartic acids.

The Sales Director of Fortilit Sistemas em Plasticos writes to complain
abut an article in Gazeta Mercantil on 9 Oct 1996.

It argues that the business strategy described as unsuccessful in the
article was abandoned in 1995 and has been changed with considerable
success in 1996.

The factory at Utinga has not been sold; the sale which provoked the
article was of a building in Santo Andre.

In reply, the journal argues that the article was fair comment in the
context of a discussion of the whole sector and a $10 M fall in sales

Franchising for collecting used PET bottles

Original text in PORTUGUESE

The Brazilian PET Packaging Makers Association (Abepet) proposes to
raise $1M from its members to fund a franchising business for the
collection and recycling of PET bottles.

The franchisers, investing from $2000-50,000, would organize by boys,
with backyard crushing and packing.

The market pays $300-400 /tonne.

The purchasers will clean, separate and grind up the bottles.

There are uses for the polyester in carpets, fibre and brushes.

Rhodia-Ster has a process for a heat insulator made from recycled PET
used with asphalt.

The use of recycled PET for food packaging is not permitted, so the
bottles cannot be reused, though it is possible to mix the used resin
with new resin in the co-injection process.

Of Brazil's present consumption of 200,000 tones/y of PET, 15% is
recycled material.

The PET market is worth $1 bn, including $500 M for 2 bn bottles/y.

Race to produce PTA

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 11 Oct 1996, No. 20.939, Pg. C-1

Original text in PORTUGUESE

The rapidly growing demand for PET for bottles in Brazil has lead to a
race to build and open a world scale PTA plant, of 350,000-500,000
tonnes/y.

The Odebrecht group company OPP has entered into a partnership,
Proppet, with the Mariani group company Nitrocarbono to build a plant
next to Petrobras' Replan refinery in Sao Paulo.

On 17 Oct 1996 Odebrecht, Mariani, Ultra and Itausa will sign a
contract with the Governor of Sao Paulo state for investment in the Sao
Paulo gas-chemical complex.

Odebrecht plans to take the paraxylene raw material for PTA from the
present mixture of xylene produced by Replan, even before the pyrolysis
plant for the Paulinia raw material centre is built.

Rhodia-Ster is to expands its present 130,000 tonnes/y PTA plant to
250,000 tonnes/y by the end of 1996.

But Amoco, which owns 49% of Rhodiaco in partnership with Rhodia-Ster
(51%), plans investment of $400 M in a new 350,000 tonnes/y plant which
can increase capacity to 500,000 tonnes/y.

A site has not yet bene chosen.

There will be competition for PET from Hoechst, which by 1998 will
expand its 9000 tonnes/y plant in Southern Brazil to 130,000 tonnes/y.

The Chicago Conference (25-27 Sep 1996) was devoted exclusively to the
theme of minerals, pigments and chemicals used in papermaking.

The world paper industry is a major end-user of certain pigments,
accounting for: 10.4 M tonnes or 45% of global kaolin consumption; 2.55
M tonnes or 73% of global precipitated calcium carbonate consumption;
and 425,000 tonnes or 12.5% of global titanium dioxide consumption.

In the US, the paper industry is much more important to the titanium
dioxide suppliers, accounting for about 25% of annual offtake,
contrasted against only 7-10% in Japan and Western Europe.

Biological herbicides: fact or fantasy?

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Focus on Biopesticides PLUS, Oct 1996, Pg. 1-2

Following the discovery and marketing of the first microbial
herbicides, Collego and Devine, in the USA in the early 1980s, there
was a massive upsurge of research in this area.

By 1989 more than 100 fungal pathogens were being studied as potential
microbial herbicides for control of 69 weed species.

Of these, 19 were considered to have good practical potential.

However, those products on the market in the USA were withdrawn for
commercial reasons (though Devine is now available again) and those
thought to be close to market have disappeared.

Many reasaons have been offered to explain the failure to translate
good microbial herbicide potential identified in laboratory experiments
to practical success in the field.

One possible reason for the failure to make biological weed control
agents work in the field is that virtually all the laboratory trials
use some form of atomiser to apply suspensions of infective propagules
to the target weed.

The spray is applied at an application volume of 1000-3000 l/ha.

Field experiments apply at not more than 500-600 l/ha in a spray
droplet spectrum consisting of droplet sizes ranging from just a few
microns to more than 500 microns in diameter.

Inevitably, there will be a reduction in the inoculum retained on the
target and changes in its distribution.

It is no surprise that field applications have been unreliable and
commercial development constrained.

The answer is that research teams should include expertise in
formulation and spray applications as well as weed and pathogen biology.

36% profit rise forecast at AgrEvo

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Farmers Weekly, Nov 1996, Vol. 125, No. 18, Pg. 25

AgrEvo is forecast to record an operating profit of #87 M in 1996, up
36%, thanks to improved sales of agrochemicals.

Worldwide sales are expected to reach #1.63 bn for the full year, up
11% on 1995.

Stronger sales have been recorded in North and South America, India,
Korea, Australia, and Pakistan.

European sales represent 45% of the total.

Investment in research and development will total #174 M in 1996,
representing 11% of turnover.

AgrEvo's research and development budget is expected to increase
rapidly because of investment in biotechnology.

About 6% of research expenditure was destined for biotechnology before
the company acquired the Dutch/Belgian biotechnology company, Plant
Genetic Systems International.

During 1996-2001 this investment is expected to increase to 25%.

By 2005 AgrEvo expects that plant and biotechnology products and
techniques will generate additional sales in excess of DM 1 bn/y.

Principal contributions to revenue will arise from sales of Liberty
Link varieties of oilseed rape. maize, sugar beet, cotton, and soya
beans which are resistant to glufosinate-ammonium.

Efficiency improving measures should reduce AgrEvo's costs by #130 M
before 1999.

Since AgrEvo was established on 1 Jan 1994 its number of employees has
been reduced by about 1300, research and marketing operations
centralised, and the number of production and formulating facilities
reduced from 39 to 26.

BASF is now supplying to European grape growers a commercial pheromone
product (Rak 1 and Rak 2) which prevents males and females of both the
vine moth and grape berry moth from mating.

The control measure is described as very effective and competitive with
conventional techniques involving insecticides.

The European Commission has been asked by a Euro-MP to investigate
alleged links between the use of organophoshate (OP) pesticides and
BSE.

A UK farmer has developed a theory that the real cause of BSE is in OP
poisoning, principally through the use of the agrochemical Phosmet to
control warble fly.

The UK government has dismissed the theory.

Part of the evidence lies in the fact that other European countries
which have not used OPs as much as the UK have not experienced the
sharp increase in the number of cases of BSE which have been reported
in the UK.

About half of this went to Asia, with Europe and N America getting
about $500 M each.

An additional $350 M of investment was announced worldwide in the
associated areas of steel cord, textile tyre reinforcements and
synthetic tyre rubber.

Over $1.5 bn of the investment was announced by Groupe Michelin for
implementation over a 3-4 year period.

Cooper Tyre announced a record $194.9 M, the highest figure in terms of
percentage of sales in the industry at 13%.

Goodyear budgeted investment of $600 M in 1996.

Forthcoming investment projects are listed by region in a table, with

Tyres: East European future is settled

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. Global Tyre Report
1996, Pg. 26

The restructuring in the central European tyre industry is now largely
complete, with only a few indigenous tyre plants left to be bought by
the majors.

These include Sava Kranj of Slovenia and Matador Puchov of Slovakia.

The business of each of these is reviewed.

Producers in the former Yugoslavia are emerging from a 3-year trade
boycott.

Michelin is the most active of the majors in the E European market.

Within the last year it has established a strong base for low cost
production of truck, tyre and agricultural tyres, which it will ship
back to W Europe or supply to eastern markets as opportunities arise.

Western companies have so far made no inroads into the industry in
Romania, Bulgaria or the Ukraine.

The best near-term growth potential is seen in the Czech and Slovak
Republics, the Ukraine, Byelorus and the Baltic states.

Russia and the other former soviet republics will take longer.

A table shows E Europe's top tyre makers by turnover.

The leader is Barum Continental of the Czech Republic, followed by
Matador of Slovakia, Somil Olsztyn and TC Debica of Poland and Sava
Semperit of Slovenia.

1996, Pg. 22

1H 1996 saw price discounting in the US tyre market, but prices should
be stable in 2H.

Demand is flat and the market is extremely competitive, because a fall
in demand at the original equipment level has left producers with
excess inventories.

For the year as a whole, some companies may see an increase in unit
sales but there will be little increase in sales values or in overall
shipment volumes.

In passenger tyres, shipments of replacement tyres will rise 3% to 172
M units, but this will be offset by a 3.5% fall in OE shipments to 55 M
units.

Tables show 1995 sales and market share in N America and Latin America
for the leading tyre companies.

The US leader is Goodyear/KS with 27.8% of the market, followed by
Michelin/UGTC with 24.7% and Bridgestone/Firestone with 21.8%.

In Latin America Goodyear has 38.7% of the market, Pirelli 20.5% and

Tyres: back to normal in Europe

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. Global Tyre Report
1996, Pg. 14

After a record year in 1995 when demand exceeded supply, the European
tyre industry is now back to its normal state of overcapacity and
falling prices.

Demand is tepid and inventories high, so production is being cut back.

The top 6 companies saw sales growth of 8-31% in 1995, but growth for
smaller companies was around 1%.

The top three tyre companies in terms of European sales are Michelin at
$6.76 bn, Continental Group at $3.670 bn, and Goodyear at $2.850 bn.

Goodyear has ambitious plans to overtake Continental.

A table shows European sales in 1995 for the top 21 companies.

The performances of the major tyre companies in Europe are briefly
discussed.

In 1995 the European market for replacement tyres grew 3.1% to 128.3 M
units. 60% of this was in the form of S/T rated summer tyres, with
H-rated summer tyres at 16% and V/W/Z-rated high performance tyres at
10%.

European shipments of medium and heavy truck tyres in 1995 were up 9.2%
to 11.9 M units.

There was a 3.3% rise in shipments of original equipment car tyres to
62.3 M units.

1996, Pg. 10-11

PT Gadjah Tunggal (GT) claims to be the largest integrated tyre
manufacturer in SE Asia.

It is near the end of a 3-year investment programme worth $385 M that
will raise capacity at its Tangerang complex near Jakarta to almost
38,000 units/day.

It had 1995 sales of almost $330 M from radial car tyres, cross-ply
light and heavy truck and motorcycle tyres, and nylon yarn and cord.

It has announced a doubling of nylon tyre cord yarn capacity from the
current 24,000 tonnes/y, and has obtained a licence to become the first
Indonesian producer of SBR.

It uses 225 tonnes/day of rubber at the complex, which also makes
tubes, belts and shoe soles.

It is now looking for an alliance with a tyre major, as well as
discussing ventures with other companies its own size.

By 2000 it will have capacity for 20 M units/y, which will include new
capacity for steel radial truck tyres and a new unit at Anhui for up to
10 M units/y of radial car tyres.

It has a market share in Indonesia of about 33%. 38% of output is
exported, reaching 70 countries.

Its yarn subsidiary Filamendo is spending $140 M on doubling nylon yarn
capacity to 48,000 and expanding into nylon 66 and polyester.

The yarn is made into cord by another subsidiary, Andayani Megah, which
has an output of 18,000 tonnes/y and licenses technology from Goodyear.

It is planning a $75 M joint venture with the Malaysian company Hicom
to produce nylon, rayon and polyester cord in Malaysia.

GT sees a captive source of SBR as a high priority, and has licensed
technology from Nippon Zeon Ltd.

It will start up a 60,000 tonnes/y emulsion SBR unit at Merak in W Java
in 1Q 1998.

1996, Pg. 8

The Japanese tyre industry is entering a mini-boom fuelled by increased
sales, successful cost cutting, investment in overseas capacity and the
fact that the weaker Yen has made exports profitable once more.

Plants are operating flat out.

Production for the first 5 months 1996 was up 3.9% on the same period
1995, and production for the full year could exceed the record 1.04 M
tonnes of new rubber used in 1995.

All Japanese tyre producers are now in profit.

Many are investing elsewhere in Asia to cut costs and take advantage of
growing markets.

A table shows all the major Asian tyre producers together with their
regional sales and their share of the Asian market.

The leading company is Bridgestone, with a market share of 29% and 1995
sales in Asia of $6.370 bn.

strategy is transform or exit.

It has identified the need for a new marketing strategy for TPEs, the

Now there are many competitors, and Shell lost market share after an
explosion closed a styrene block copolymer line at Belpre in the US for

The company now sees itself as stronger and fitter in TPEs, and a new
management team is now trying to turn the business around and run it on
global lines.

It has production sites in Brazil, the US, Europe and Japan, and has a

According to Vredestein Rubber Recycling BV, recycling is the best way
both economically and ecologically to deal with both production and
post-consumer rubber scrap.

The article discusses the technical, regulatory and economic issues
relating to dealing with rubber waste, and examines the options
available.

Vredestein has developed Surcrum, a surface-activated crumb rubber made
from rubber waste.

Surface activation doubles mechanical stability compared with untreated
crumb and makes the material more suitable for use in compounding.

The process can be used with a wide range of polymers.

Surcrum made from NR and SBR has already been commercialized, and
development of NBR and EPDM grades is underway.

The technical specifications and advantages of Surcrum are reviewed.

It can be cured either in a continuous process or by compression
moulding.

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 33

Santoprene 800 is a new range of thermoplastic elastomers from Advanced
Elastomer Systems (AES).

The company says it is already in use in various applications and sees
it as an important expansion of its product line.

It is based on a new proprietary vulcanization technology and is said
to be the first non-hygroscopic TPE.

As well as offering the standard Santoprene properties it has a number
of unique features.

Because it does not attract moisture it does not need to be dried,
which saves processing costs.

It will be particularly useful in Asia and other hot, humid climates
where drying equipment is not always available.

It also has good colouring properties and a very white base colour
which means that pale colours can be introduced easily.

This opens up new applications in which pale colours are important.

It also has very high purity and low residual halogen content.

It is initially available in 12 grades: four general purpose, five high
flow and three FDA-compliant.

Recyclability drives TPE profiles

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 33-34

Producers of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are confident that TPEs
will overtake EPDM as the material of choice for automotive profiles, a
market of about 500,000 tonnes/y.

How long this will take is not certain.

The major advantage of TPEs is their recyclability, though the
separation of parts is still a major hurdle for many components.

The European market for thermoplastic vulcanisates is currently
20,000-24,000 tonnes/y, and this would be greatly increased if TPVs
were used in automotive weatherstripping.

Each vehicle has an average of 12kg of rubber weatherstripping, adding
up to a market of over 150,000 tonnes/y in Europe and 441,000 tonnes/y
worldwide.

However, the switch away from EPDM would involve major machinery costs
for rubber processors.

A second advantage of TPEs over EPDM is better tear resistance.

EPDM seals are failing under warranty and causing problems for car
manufacturers.

General Motors is reported to be replacing EPDM trim with alternative
materials within the next 5 years.

Japanese car makers are pioneering the use of new materials.

Foamed grades of TPEs will be very important.

The use of scrap tyres as fuel in cement kilns is less widespread in
the UK than in the rest of Europe and N America.

However, Blue Circle Cement has set up a trial project at its
Northfleet Works in Kent.

Energy represents about one-third of its production costs, and the use
of tyres will save it money.

The trials are going successfully.

The tyres are combusted at 1100 C, at which temperature they do not
produce an increase in emissions from the kiln.

If an application for the permanent use of tyres were successful, the
problem of tyre disposal in the Kent area would be substantially
reduced.

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 26,28,30

The political pressure surrounding the issue of scrap tyres in the
European Union is much lower in late 1996 than it was a year earlier.

The European Commission is discussing waste issues in general and no
proposals have yet been forthcoming.

In the mean time, impending legislation and market forces have
stimulated the industry to begin setting up its own programmes.

It is not certain whether the EU will tackle the issue with a directive
or with recommendations.

In the UK, the buoyant retreading market coupled with numerous
pyrolysis, tyres-for-energy and tyres as cement kiln fuel projects,
should increase recovery further in the medium term.

However, it is not known if energy recovery will be seen as an
acceptable form of recycling by the EU.

Various approaches to recycling are discussed, with the emphasis on the
UK.

A table shows the amount of scrap tyre waste produced in each European
country; for the UK the figure is 350,000-400,000 tonnes/y.

Sweden's tyre recycling scheme is briefly reviewed.

Indspec Chemical Corp of the US is evaluating three possible sites for
a 9000 tonnes/y resorcinol plant in W Europe.

The project will cost $50 M and is due for startup by early 1999.

Resorcinol is made from benzene and is used to bond rubber and cord in
tyre production.

Indspec predicts continuing healthy growth in resorcinol markets,
including new applications.

The new plant will use a new hydroperoxidation process based on benzene
and propylene and producing acetone as a by-product.

European customers are currently supplied from its US plant, the
company's only resorcinol unit, that has recently been expanded by 18%
to 23,500 tonnes/y.

Indspec says it is the world's leading resorcinol supplier, and is
actively developing new applications.

Currently about half of all consumption is used in the tyre industry.

Rubber chemicals shortage looming

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 21

According to Bayer AG, the rubber industry will face a supply crisis
for processing chemicals in the next 2-3 years unless prices for the
chemicals recover to reasonable levels.

Prices are only 60-70% of the level of the late 1980s, and it is
questionable whether re-investment can be justified.

Yet up to 200,000 tonnes of new capacity will be needed worldwide
within the next 10 years, equivalent to one new plant each year.

The total necessary investment is around $667 M.

These figures are based on 3%/y demand growth and the need to phase out
older, uneconomic plants.

If supplies become short, prices would fluctuate wildly, which would be
bad for both suppliers and customers.

Bayer says it is not prepared to shoulder supply responsibilities
alone, although it is in the strongest position to weather the crisis
because its rubber business is back-integrated into rubber chemicals.

It is currently looking for rubber chemical production partners in
India and China, and is prepared to spend over $200 M on these
projects.

Bayer says the pricing problem is not just about allowing new
investment, but about producers staying in the industry at all.

recently set up joint ventures in India and Indonesia.

Yokohama Rubber Co Ltd of Japan is preparing to set up a production
base in Vietnam to supply Asia and Europe.

A feasibility study is being carried out with Mitsubishi for a $60 M
plant near Ho Chi Minh City for a plant with capacity for 450,000
units/y of car and light truck tyres and 1 M units/y for two-wheeler
tyres.

Vietnam already has five vehicle assembly joint ventures, and up to
nine more are being discussed.

In 1994 it produced 900,000 cars and 4.4 M commercial vehicles.

Three compounding projects for MERL

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 20

Materials Engineering Research Laboratory Ltd (MERL) of the UK has
launched R&D projects in three areas of advanced rubber compounding.

These are processable low temperature cure compounds; high fatigue
resistant compounds, and mathematical models of rubber compounding.

Each project will last 3 years, and participants will pay about
$15,000/y.

They will start in 1997.

The processable low temperature cure compounds will be based on an
existing set of compounds that show rapid curing at around 70 C, are
easy to process and have good performance characteristics.

The high fatigue resistance project will involve a search for compounds
based on elastomer blends and various particulate fillers, and will aim
to produce compounds that can withstand repeated flexing in harsh
environmental conditions.

Pirelli tyre earnings improve

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 17

Sales revenue for Pirelli Tyre Holding NV rose 8.9% to HFL 2.903 bn
($1738.7 bn) in 1H 1996.

Operating profit was up 46.7% at HFL 197.4 M, and net group result was
up 418% to HFL 55.4 M.

HFL 83.5 M was allocated in extraordinary charges, primarily to cover
restructuring in N America.

The results reflect ongoing efficiency measures and a renewal of the
product range.

The earnings/sales ratio rose to 6.8%, a step towards the goal of
raising profitability high enough to provide a satisfactory return on
investment.

Factors contributing to the turnover rise were improved sales of
performance tyres to car producers, consolidation of market share in
premium replacement tyres, a significant sales increase for motorcycle
tyres and satisfactory sales of truck and agricultural tyres.

The finances of Pirelli Armstrong Tire in the US improved, but the
plant at Nashville, TN, will still be closed in early 1997.

The company believes that a turnaround in its N American business can
only be achieved by concentrating on the high-margin Pirelli brand,
premium tyres and light truck tyres, all produced at the plant at
Hanford, CA.

Hoechst, Sabanci in tyre cord jv

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: European Rubber Journal, Nov 1996, Vol. 178, No. 10, Pg. 16

Hoechst AG plans to set up a 50/50 joint venture with Sabanci Holding
of Turkey for the production of high modulus/low shrinkage polyester
tyre cord yarn and fabric.

The DM 145 M ($97 M) venture will become operational in 1999, and will
carry out production at Sabanci's tyre production complex near Izmit.

It will have capacity for 14,000 tonnes/y each of Trevira polyester
yarn and complete cord and fabric processing.

About 80% of output will be exported, mostly to W Europe.

Hoechst Trevira says more and more tyre companies are outsourcing tyre
cord production, and it is increasing its forward integration in this
area.

It expects polyester to overtake rayon as the main tyre cord material
in W Europe in 1998, and expects the region's demand for polyester cord
to double to over 50,000 tonnes/y within 6 years.

It currently has a small production plant in Germany and imports cord
made in the US and Mexico.

In the last year it has spent $170 M on new tyre cord capacity,
including setting up a joint venture in India with Reliance Industries.

It expects sales growth of 25% for tyre cord in 1996 due to new
capacity coming on stream; sales are currently over $200 M/y.

It says the world market for high modulus, low shrinkage polyester yarn
for tyre cord is growing at 10%/y and will reach almost 300,000
tonnes/y by 2000.

Two Spanish directors of the Solvay plant near Barcelona have been
fined PTS 1 M and sentenced to house arrest for one month for
discharging excessive amounts of chloride from their PVC plant into the
River Llobregat, which flows into the Mediterranean Sea.

The sentence passed by the judge heavily criticised the local water
authorities for authorising Solvay to emit chloride which was found to
be 15 times over the legal limit.

Solvay has appealed the decision.

Two additional court cases against the same Solvay directors are
pending.

Greenpeace prosecutes Tarkett over PVC production

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Greenpeace Business, Oct-Nov 1996, No. 33, Pg. 5

Three years ago, Tarkett, the world's second largest manufacturer of
PVC floorings, announced a gradual phaseout of PVC as a raw material in
its products.

In Oct 1993, Tarkett was sold to a German company which is less
committed to phasing out PVC.

Although the company has recently launched a new range of PVC-free
flooring, factory managers admit that they have no concrete plans to
phase out PVC.

They are, instead, actively expanding their PVC products into South
Africa, eastern Europe and the Middle East, where PVC disposal methods
are lax.

In Sweden, Tarkett sells 60% of all PVC floors.

As the single largest user of PVC, it is also the biggest DEHP
polluter.

It is estimated that there is a leaching of DEHP from PVC floors into
the environment of 30-60 tonne/y.

DEHP has been identified as a hormone disruptor which can affect the
health and development of infants at extremely low levels.

In Aug 1996, a fire at the municipal dump in Ronneby, Sweden (where the
Tarkett plant is located) broke out when hot PVC waste was dumped from
the plant.

Greenpeace demanded dioxin tests and widespread publicity ensued.

In addition to carrying out direct actions at the plant, Greenpeace has
also filed a case against Tarkett for breaking the rule of
substitution.

The suit is based on a Swedish law which states that anyone using a
hazardous substance has to substitute this with a less hazardous
substance if there is one on the market.

Greenpeace is demanding a PVC phaseout plan from Tarkett and is
contacting outlets which sell Tarkett floorings asking them to sell
alternative PVC flooring.

Anti-dumping investigation into insecticides from Chile

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 14 Oct 1996, No. 28 Latino-Americana (supplement),
Pg. 13

Original text in PORTUGUESE

The Brazilian government is considering anti-dumping measures against
imports of magnesium phosphate based insecticides from Chile.

There is only one Brazilian company making such insecticides, which are
used to protect agricultural produce in store: Casa Bernardo Ltda.

But the Ministry argues that the normal cost of the insecticide is
$303.30 /kg, while imports from Chile are reaching Brazil at $9.87 /kg.

Sales by the Brazilian maker have fallen from 100% of the market in
1992 to 80% in Jun 1996, and the growth rate fell from 54% in 1994 to
5% in 1995.

Imports grew 132% in 1994.

The price in Brazil fell 4% in 1995.

The farming industry is concerned that the government intervention will
force up prices and costs.

Change in subsidy will increase fuel alcohol prices

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 14 Oct 1996, No. 20.940, Pg. A-1,A-4

Original text in PORTUGUESE

The subsidy on fuel alcohol encumbers Petrobras with an average loss of
Reals 80 M/mo, and from Jan 1996 it wishes it to fall entirely on the
consumer.

A study before the government also proposes the freeing of anhydrous
alcohol, with a consequent increase in the price of hydrated alcohol.

The Finance Ministry wishes to bring in the price increases more
gradually because of their inflationary effect, and the Ministry of
Trade, Industry and Commerce considers that cutting the subsidy will
have a serious effect on producers.

The end of the subsidy in 1997 would give an average price increase of
5-7%.

Petrobras would save Reals 40 M/mo from cutting out the subsidy and
Reals 40 M/mo from the resultant lower administrative costs.

The proposals also envisage the end of the subsidy on hydrated alcohol,
for which demand is falling because there are fewer alcohol fuelled
cars.

The subsidy would be maintained to assist producers in North-East
Brazil.

It would be Reals 10/cubic metre, the difference between the general
subsidy and the increased subsidy now paid in the NE.

The strategy of the Odebrecht group

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 11 Oct 1996, No. 20.939, Pg. Relatorio 4

Original text in PORTUGUESE

Since 1990 the Odebrecht group has taken advantage of the privatization
of the petrochemical sector and the reduction of the shareholding of
Petroquisa (Petrobras) to 15% in the sector, to add businesses in this
filed, amounting to Reals 1.78 bn in 1995, to its traditional
activities of construction (about Reals 3.5 bn) and engineering
services (Reals 1.935 bn).

In 1990 it had shares in Salgema, Cia Petroquimica de Camacari, and a
38% share in Unipar.

It is now in a position to integrate the chlorine and PVC activities of
Salgema and CPC into Trikem at Bahia, and owns Poliolefinas in Sao
Paulo.

It controls the centre at Triunfo, which it administers with Ipiranga.

In Bahia, Trikem and Poliolefinas give Odebrecht an important share in
the capital of Norquisa, even before Conepar's share's are sold.

While it has 38.78% of the capital of Unipar, Unipar in its turn has
31.47% of the capital of Poliolefinas, so that Odebrecht cannot unite
all its operations within OPP.

Disagreements with Unipar over Unipar's PQU in Sao Paulo, which
supplies all the ethylene for Odebrecht's PE production, have led
Odebrecht to undertake investment in the second Sao Paulo petrochemical
complex.

It is also to take part in a $250 M PET project with the Mariani group,
using both DMT and PTA as raw materials, and in a $300 M propylene
project with Elekeiroz within the second Sao Paulo complex near the
Replan refinery.

Its total investment up to 2000 will be $1 bn, and its 1995 output was
1.189 M tonnes of plastic resins.

Original text in PORTUGUESE

Companhia Brasileira de Estireno, a joint venture of Monsanto and the
Unigel group, has postponed the opening of its new PS plant to
mid-1998, enabling it to increase capacity from 50,000 tonnes/y to
100,000 tonnes/y.

The plant will be located in Monsanto's site in Sao Jose dos Campos,
and $30 M will be invested.

The number of employees will increase from 110 to 170.

CBE expects to increase its share of the Brazilian PS market to 33% as
a result, and to expand exports in the Mercosul market.

At present Monsanto takes 50% of CBE's output and Unigel 20%, the rest
being sold on the market.

CBE produces its styrene at a 120,000 tonnes/y plant at Cubatao (Sao
Paulo).

This will be sufficient to supply its PS expansion, but the new PS
plant will take all its output.

At present the whole operation brings sales of $102 M, with $58 M
coming from Sao Jose and $44 M from Cubatao.

The expansion project will raise Sao Jose's sales to $116 M, but reduce
those from Cubatao to $14 M, because of the ending of sales on the
external market.

Brazil at present produces 215,000 tonnes/y of PS; 140,00 from EDN and
50,000 tonnes from CBE.

Proquigel produces 25,000 tonnes/y and 46,000 tonnes/y is imported,

It will increase production to 85,000 sq metres/y.

In 1996 Reals 10 M was spent on increasing output from 32 M sq metres/y
to 55 M sq metres/y.

It is used in the car industry for insulation and in the shoe industry,
which takes 45% of output, as a base for synthetic leather, as well as
in soil conservation.

Exports will rise from 20% in 1996 to 25% in 1997. 35% of output is
used in civil engineering for soil reinforcement, water barriers etc,
and further 20% as a thermal and acoustic insulator in domestic
electrical goods.

The plant at Sao Jose dos Campos has sales of $25 M/y.

Rhodia has developed special varieties of this fabric, for example for
asphalted waterproofing sheet for water channels, and for shoe use. 10%
of recycled material is used, which is derived from plastic bottles.

tonnes/y, as well as increasing paraxylene production from 79,000
tonnes/y by a further 200,000 tonnes/y, by Aug 1997.

This will make possible the Reals 240 M PET project by Proppet, an
Odebrecht (49% through OPP) and Mariani group joint venture, which will
start operation in 1998.

Proppet will also take over the intermediate dimethyl terephthalate
production of Mariani's Nitrocarbono.

Odebrecht also has plans to produce PET in Rio Grande do Sul, using
PTA, but these are on hold in case the market is oversupplied.

Camacari's additional ethylene production is already committed to
ethylene oxide production by the Ultra group company Oxiteno, which
will be increased from 130,000 tonnes/y to 235,000 tonnes/y.

Oxiteno will use all this output itself to make glycol ethers, the raw
material for polyester fibre.

The new plant will open in Apr 1997, when Copene's extra ethylene is
available.

Deten Quimica will also increase its output of linear alkylbenzene, the
raw material for biodegradable detergents, from 50,000 tonnes/y to

paraxylene to make PTA.

This unit may possibly be built before the raw materials centre.

Interest has been shown by Oxiteno, which would like to produce
ethylene oxide.

The South-East and Centre-West regions of Brazil which this centre will
serve, contains 65% of Brazil's market for petrochemicals.

The impetus for the development is the inability of PQU, Sao Paulo's
existing petrochemical raw materials centre, to satisfy the demand, in
spite of its increase in capacity in 1996.

Original text in PORTUGUESE

Copesul, the raw materials centre in the Rio Grande do Sul
petrochemical complex, is to increase its ethylene capacity by 450,000
tonnes/y, mostly by building a new unit.

It will produce 685,000 tonnes in 1996, which represents an 85,000
tonnes more than in 1995, and had a $50 M technical programme which
will enable higher production from the existing plant.

It also has environmental improvement programmes.

The expansion pan, which will be complete in 1998, will cost a total of
$570 M.

Raw material supply the main challenge for the Brazilian petrochemical
industry

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 11 Oct 1996, No. 20.939, Pg. Relatorio 1;3

Original text in PORTUGUESE

The most urgent problem for the petrochemical industry in Brazil is not
competitiveness in the international market but that of obtaining
supplies.

Most multinationals are either linked to major refineries, refine their
own naphtha or can buy on the open market.

Brazil's petrochemical industry derives from a state decision to obtain
maximum value for its petroleum monopoly, and the state holding company
Petroquisa was responsible for chemical raw materials.

Following the liberalization of the petroleum market the petrochemical
companies are negotiating arrangements with Petrobras to guarantee
their supplies.

They are also seeking the dissolution of Conepar, the chemical arm of
the former Economico group, which controls Norquisa and through it
Copene, Brazil's largest petrochemical complex, in Bahia.

Copene is 2000 km from Brazil's largest market in Sao Paulo and depends
in the agreement of its shareholders to ensure its market role.

Some, such as Odebrecht, Mariani, Suzano and Ultra are already involved
in the Rio de Janeiro gas-chemical complex project or the proposed
Paulinia complex, next to Petrobras' Replan refinery.

The petrochemical industry had a $6 bn investment programme up to the
end of the century, and since 1995 almost 40% of this has already been
spent.

The industry also needs to increase exports above its present 20%.

It is very dependent on imported technology from major multinationals
and in 1994 spent only 0.77% of sales on R&D.

Multinationals are in fact ready to become involved in the growing
Brazilian and Mercosul markets, and the high price Dow paid for the
Bahia Blanca refinery and for Indupa is a sign of this.

Lubricants sector becomes more specialized

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Gazeta Mercantil, 11 Oct 1996, No. 20.939, Pg. C-3

Original text in PORTUGUESE

Brazil uses 850,000 tonnes/y of lubricants, 65% for automobiles and 35%
in industry, with a value of Reals 1.4 bn.

By contrast, Mexico uses 450,000 tonnes.

The market in Brazil is expected to rise to 900,000 tonnes/y by 2001,
but as the average age of the vehicles in use Brazil, now 6 years,
continues to fall, and oil is replaced less often, the rate of growth
in the use of lubricants will be restrained.

Products will become more specialized.

Exxon Quimica hopes to be able to introduce new formulas if Petrobras'
monopoly is removed and the import of oils and additives is permitted.

It buys 20,000 tonnes/y of aliphatic solvents from Petrobras, for some
$10 M/y.

Shell Brasil has 19% of the market, while Petrobras' BR Distribuidora
has 21%, and hopes to increase this by 2%, worth Reals 28 M/y.

It is investing $4 M in 1996 in marketing a new product, Lubraz SJ.

Ref: Japan Chemical Week, 24 Oct 1996, Vol. 37, No. 1898, Pg. 3

In an effort to reduce the cost of agrochemicals, a request has been
made to the Japanese Prime Minister's Office by the Central Union of
Agricultural Cooperatives that the application procedures for generic
agrochemicals be simplified.

Currently, companies wishing to market a drug for which the patent has
expired must undertake independent toxicity tests before the chemical
can be considered for registration.

The authorities are understood to be concerned that such a move would
reduce the effort made by companies to develop new products.

Mitsui Toatsu to advance into plastic IC substrates

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Japan Chemical Week, 24 Oct 1996, Vol. 37, No. 1898, Pg. 3

A 20,000 sq m/y facility for production of plastic substrates for
semiconductors is to be built at Atsugi by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc
at a cost of Yen 500 M.

In 1998, the company aims to achieve sales of Yen 1 bn.

Yen 2-3 bn will be invested to increase capacity to 60,000 sq m/y by
early 1999.

Substantial growth is forecast for these substrates for which the
Japanese market currently stands at Yen 40 bn/y.

By 2000, demand could increase to Yen 200 bn/y.

Two types of substrate are to be produced by Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals.

One combines a superfunctional resin and a special metal, and exhibits
higher heat release characteristics.

The other is a polymer alloy which is easier to process and can
withstand soldering temperatures up to 300 degC.

NGK Spark Plug Co and Kyocera Corp are also planning to move into this
sector.

Hexamine supply tightens in Japan

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Japan Chemical Week, 24 Oct 1996, Vol. 37, No. 1898, Pg. 2,8

In Jul 1996, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Inc halted production of
hexamethylenetetramine (hexamine) because it was unprofitable.

This resulted in lower domestic production.

Increased domestic demand for hexamine in Taiwan and China has resulted
in lower exports of the material to Japan.

Thus supplies of hexamine in Japan have tightened.

The primary application for hexamine is in phenol resins as a hardener
and in resins for shell moulding.

The Japanese market is estimated at 12,000 tonne/y and is not expected
to grow.

However, demand elsewhere in Asia is increasing in line with the
growing production there of household electrical appliances and
automobiles.

No capacity expansions are expected by the two remaining producers,
Nippon Kasei Chemical Co and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, which are also
finding production unprofitable.

They both have capacities of around 5500 tonne/y.

Toyo Seikan Kaisha Ltd and Yoshino Kogyosho Co are the dominant
companies in the Japanese PET bottle market, holding an 80% share.

Toyo Seikan Kaisha licences technology from Yoshino Kogyosho for the
production of PET bottles resistant to temperatures of 80-85 degC.

The technology is protected by patents, preventing small and
medium-sized companies from gaining significant market share.

However, a mixture of PET (90%) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)
(10%) has been used by researchers at Aoki Technical Laboratory to
produce a bottle that is resistant to higher temperatures up to 90
degC.

Such bottles can be sterilized and be used for hot-fill products.

Interest in the blend has been shown by Teijin Ltd and Japan Unipet Co.

This in turn is expected to result in higher prices.

Technical problems closed Reliance's PTA unit in India in Oct 1996, and
in the same month, problems also closed Mitsubishi Chemical's facility
at Matsuyama.

In China, facilities operated by Yangzi Petrochemical Corp and Yizheng
Chemical Fibre United were also closed due to technical problems.

Supplies are expected to remain tight until 2Q 1997 in spite of the
planned startup of Dae Han Synthetic Fibre Co's new facility early in

LarvX SG is a highly selective insecticide.

It has 31% higher active ingredient than conventional Bti granules.

Control authorities concerned about the development of resistance to
temephos larvicide may be particularly interested.

Bti is acknowledged as one of the most effective and environmentally
acceptable mosquito control substances currently available.

Bti contains protein crystals that become toxic to the mosquito only
after activation in the insect's intestinal tract.

Humans, vertebrates, and most other insects have an acidic gut
environment and so are unaffected by the proteins.

Ref: International Pest Control, Sep-Oct 1996, Vol. 38, No. 5, Pg. 142

A group of bacteria have been identified which could have potential in
a new biological system for degrading persistent organic chemicals.

The bacteria are particularly effective at degrading isoproturon, one
of the UK's most widely used herbicides.

Isoproturon is a significant contaminant of surface water in the UK
agricultural areas.

It can also contaminate water indirectly during the disposal of excess
spray or the cleaning of sprayers.

When the microorganisms are added to soil or water samples containing
isoproturon, they grow and quickly break down the isoproturon.

One of the microorganisms can degrade the isoproturon within days.

Bioremediation of contaminated land or water resources could be
straightforward.

its conclusion.

He added: "The company believes that retail price maintenance on

Only a small proportion of Boots the Chemists' sales would be affected
and past experience suggests that the business would emerge with
increased market share.

John Bridgeman, the OFT's director general, said three weeks ago that a
26 year old agreement which allows manufacturers to set prices on
over-the-counter treatments such as painkillers and vitamins had cost
consumers #180 M a year on average through artifically high prices.

The move, which some analsysts believe could lead to price reductions
of up to 15% and cut Boots' overall profits by as much as 6%, was a
victory for Asda, the supermarket chain, which has led a campaign to
scrap the arrangement.

Sir Michael Angus was speaking as Boots reported a 9% rise in profits
before exceptional items in the six months to Sep 1996.

Boots the Chemists, the core pharmacy chain, saw profits rise from
#164.3 M to #184 M.

British Biotech shares slump on 'complicated data'

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Independent, 5 Nov 1996, Pg. 19

British Biotech's shares slumped 9% yesterday despite test results
which the company claimed provided further confirmation of the
effectiveness of its Marimastat anti-cancer treatment.

The company, whose shares soared a year ago on hopes for Marimastat,
said the phase two trials involving 381 cancer sufferers were the most
wide-ranging yet and gave further evidence of the drug's ability to
restrain the disease across a wide range of cancers.

But it was rewarded with a 21.5p slump in the share price to 207.5p
yesterday.

James Noble, finance director said: "It is rather odd that the shares
have gone down, because these are by far the most important results we
have reported as a company."

He ascribed the reaction to the fact that data was "just very, very
complicated".

Many analysts, however, downplayed the significance of the results,
which for the first time included information on trials with patients
with gastric and colorectal cancers.

One analyst said: "Our broad thinking is that the information dosen't
really add substantially to what we already know."

Questions remained about the dosage regime and the side-effects of the
drug, which causes pains in the arm and shoulder when used over a
prolonged period.

The data was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology
meeting in Vienna, which brings together cancer specialists from all
around Europe.

British Biotech said the tests confirmed earlier results that showed
higher dosage rates of 10mg, 25mg and 50mg twice a day were more
effective than lower ones.

The group claimed that the outcomes confirmed there was a connection
between a reduction in antigens, used as a marker to monitor the
progression of cancer, and a reduction in the disease.

"It is absolutely proved that we can reduce the antigens in a group of
381 patients and where we reduce the antigens people live longer," Mr
Noble said, "We obviously think it is the drug's effect, but we can't
prove it as yet."

The results in 14 patients suffering from gastric cancers showed half
appearing to respond or showing no further progression of the disease.

Despite microscopic evidence that Marimastat was coating tumours in a
fibre, as predicted, analysts said the sample size was too small to be
significant.

Other studies in colorectal, ovarian and pancreatic cancers had shown
similar results, Mr Noble said.

Phase three trials under way on Marimastat remains the key to the
drug's final approval and launch onto the market, which is unlikely
before 1999 or 2000, analysts say.

A treatment for pancreatic cancer is likely to be first to market, but
external sales forecasts vary widely from $100 M in the first year to
$1 bn.

Later this month, the group will give phase three test data for its
Lexipaphant treatment.

Medeva wins court case

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Independent, 1 Nov 1996, Pg. 26

Medeva, the drugs group, yesterday won final victory in its legal
battle to defend its novel Hepatitis B vaccine against rivals Biogen of
the US.

The House of Lords threw out an appeal by Biogen attempting to overturn
an earlier ruling by the Court of Appeal that Medeva's drug, Hepagene,
did not infringe its patent over a similar treatment.

Alexandra Hockenhull, a Medeva spokeswoman, said: "The outcome sends a
very strong signal.

We had felt extremely confident all along.

We had a decisive victory in the appeal court and now, with another
decisive victory in the House of Lords, we feel even more confident.

The group still faces a separate patent infringement action over
Hepagene filed in 1993 by Pasteur-Merieux, a French drugs group.

However, it had not proceeded "expeditiously" with the claim, she said,
and a trial date had not yet been requested or set.

The drug, which is still under development, was acquired for a little
over $3 M by Medeva in 1992 from a group of Swiss and German scientists
known as Epitec.

Biogen, whose own Hepatitis B vaccine is licensed to SmithKline Beecham
and Merck, won an initial action against Medeva in the High Court in
1993.

But the House of Lords ruled yesterday that Biogen's patent was invalid
in the UK.

Medeva said it hoped to announce the results of phase three trials of
Hepagene as a vaccine in Jan 1997, with phase 2 proof of principal
tests on its effectiveness as a treatment due by the end of the year.

Estimates suggest that around 30 M people in the world carrying the
Hepatitis B virus are highly infectious.

Biogen's chief executive, Jim Vincent, said: "Although we expect to
continue receiving our UK royalties of less than a million dollars
annually based on the surviving Hepatitis B patent, we are clearly
disappointed by today's decision."

Original text in CZECH

Granitol, Czech Republic, a manufacturer of polyethylene packaging
foils, has commissioned a new line.

The line allows two-colour printing on palletisation foils.

Granitol bought the line for DM 1.6 M (about CEK 32 M).

In 1995 the investment went into two blow-moulding lines with a
printing machine and into an automatic welding line for bags and
carriers.

The company invested the most of its 1995 net profit, which totalled
CEK 2.1 M.

Granitol saw a net profit of CEK 18.7 M in 1994.

The company's turnover rose by 37% to CEK 722 M in 1995 compared to
1994.

The firm has a stock of CEK 265.5 M.

Bochemie Group (BG), Czech Republic, a group of 15 chemical firms, is
aiming to acquire a 62% stake in Vyzkumny ustav organickych syntez
(VUOS), Pardubice, Czech Republic.

VUOS is a research institute in organic syntheses.

BG is also interested in a 25% stake in Kadm (Olava, Poland), which
recycles nickel-cadmium accumulators.

BG's entrance onto the Polish photochemicals market should be
accelerated by the prepared subsidiary Foma Poland.

BG expects a consolidated turnover of CEK 1.2-1.5 bn in 1996.

The most of the sum should be generated by the parent company,
Bochemie, and the photochemicals manufacturer, Foma, Czech Republic.

Bochemie expects proceeds of about CEK 525 M and a gross profit of
about CEK 45 M.

Foma plans a profit of approximately CEK 400 M.

BG has three field subgroups.

The chemical subgroup is headed by Bochemie, the photochemical subgroup
by Foma and the pharmaceutical subgroup by Bofarma (Brno, Czech
Republic).

BG holds a 60% stake in Permedia, Poland, which used to supply Bochemie
with semi-products for accumulator material manufacture.

In 3Q 1996 DSM recorded a profit of HFL 178 M, less than the HFL 234 M
reported in 3Q 1995 and also less than had been forecast.

The downturn was attributed to increased prices for oil but lower
prices for bulk chemicals, which meant reduced margins.

Results for the whole of 1996 are expected to be down on those of 1995.

Turnover reached HFL 2.48 bn in 3Q 1996, compared with HFL 2.25 bn in

Original text in GERMAN

Ormecon Chemie GmbH & Co KG at Ahrensburg in Germany aims to
revolutionise industrial corrosion inhibition with organic metals,
mainly in the aviation and ship-building industries over the next 5-7
years.

This will be achieved with the new plastic Ormecon which exhibits the
properties of a metal.

On average Ormecon provides corrosion protection for between 2 to 5
times longer than conventional materials.

Ormecon Chemie will concentrate the marketing of Ormecon on industry
sectors that still apply toxic materials such as chromate, for example
corrosion inhibitors in aviation building and multi-storey steel
constructions.

Even the US space agency NASA is interested in the new material.

Other application sectors are discussed.

Ormecon is already marketed in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Poland
and Hungary.

The new material is manufactured at Ormecon Chemie in Ahrensburg in
Germany and at the facility of a licensee in Buffalo, NY in the US.

Ormecon Chemie is a subsidiary of Zipperling Kessler & Co.

The company achieves turnover of below DM 1 M/y and still operates with
a loss.

Towards the end of 1996 Ormecon Chemie's capital will be increased to a
double-digit million deutschmark figure.

Ormecon's expansion will be accelerated by the taking up of venture
capital worth around DM 20 M.

Ormecon Chemie is expected to break-even soon.

The company is owned by 6 private investors.

Cautious forecasts envisage a turnover increase of between DM 10-20 M
in the coming decade; optimistic forecasts put this figure as high as
DM 200 M.

Ormecon Chemie GmbH plans to enter the stockmarket in 7-8 years.

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Japan Chemical Week, 24 Oct 1996, Vol. 37, No. 1898, Pg. 7-8

By 2000, China plans to increase the proportion of its chemical
industry devoted to fine chemicals from 32% to 45%.

The developments will take place under its current Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000).

Plans include the introduction of relevant technology from overseas.

Also by 2000, the country aims to become self-sufficient in the supply
of phosphatic compound fertilizers.

Research will also be carried out into agrochemicals which require a
lower application rate.

There are plans for construction of production facilities for
agrochemical intermediates.

There will also be an emphasis on environmental protection and
preservation.

PVC to be recycled as coke alternative

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Japan Chemical Week, 24 Oct 1996, Vol. 37, No. 1898, Pg. 7

Within 12 months, new technology allowing waste PVC to be used as a
coke substitute in blast furnaces, is to be made commercially available
by NKK Corp.

The process removes chlorine from the waste as hydrochloric acid,
making it safe for use as a reducing agent in the blast furnace.

At Kawasaki, the company has recently begun operation of a 30,000
tonne/y waste plastic recycling unit at its steel mill.

The waste material is granulated and then used as a reducing agent in
the furnace.

Currently, this system does not recycle PVC or fibre reinforced
plastics.

Range of barrier options upgrade flexible packaging

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Modern Plastics International, Oct 1996, Vol. 26, No. 10, Pg.
70-71,73,75

Over the next few years it is expected that barrier packaging will
increase its market share at the expense of glass and metal, with
highest growth forecast in Europe and Asia.

Demand for ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) is expected to grow by 16-20%
in Europe and by 14-16% in N America with worldwide demand increasing
25% to 30,800 tonnes/y.

A new production line is to be installed by EVAL Corp, a subsidiary of
Kuraray of Japan which dominates the global EVOH market with a 70%
share, at Pasadena, TX, US, which will increase capacity from 12,740
tonnes/y to 18,200 tonnes/y.

The company is also planning to invest $74 M in a food grade packaging
material plant in Europe or N America.

Flexible films are the fastest growing EVOH packaging material
accounting for about 28-30% of the total market.

New EVOH resins including the hybrid film VM-XL, where aluminium is
coated on to EVOH, and an EVOH grade which is crosslinked with
polyolefins giving similar mechanical strength, stretch and heat
resistance as shrink film from Kuraray and Nippon Gohsei's DC302Ae
Soarnol EVOH grade.

EVOH is making inroads into the market for polyvinylidene (PVDC)
despite its predicted 10%/y growth in demand.

In China demand for PVDC is expected to reach 10,000 tonnes/y by 2000
to be met mostly by imports which currently stand at $1450/tonne.

Other new developments in the barrier film market include a 3 layer,
monoaxially oriented nylon from AlliedSignal Specialty Films for quick
sale food items; a Surlyn ionomer resin blended with EVOH grades from
DuPont; hybrid organic/inorganic polymers (Ormocers) from the
Fraunhofer Institute and SiOx barrier coatings to replace aluminium

The UK's Pesticides Registration Section of the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) is assessing the possible impact of the new Biocidal
Products Directive on its activities under the Control of Pesticides
Regulations.

A significant time frame is required from initiation through to the
granting of approvals when applications for approval of products
containing new active ingredients are made.

This is normally greater than 12 months.

HSE is seeking information on the expected numbers of longer term
projects such as these so that it can plan its activities under the

Progress of the biocidal products directive

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Pesticides Register, Oct 1996, No. 10, Pg. 1

Ministers have reached a Common Position on the proposed directive on
Biocidal Products at a meeting of The Environment Council in Luxembourg
on 26 Jun 1996.

Under the co-decision procedure, the next significant move will be the
second reading in the European Parliament, the result of which will be
considered by Council.

The estimate for adoption is about mid- 1997.

The Biocidal Products Directive has a simplified registration procedure
for low risk products, and it also includes the concepts of frame
formulations and commodity substances.

There is also provision for Member States to charge a fee for
conducting the procedures that the directive requires.

In addition, there is removal of the linkage between the periods of
data protection in The Plant Protection Products Directive (91/414/EEC)
and the Biocides Directive where the same data has already been
protected under 91/414.

Japanese regulations on orphan drugs

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: OTIS News, 25 Oct 1996, Vol. 6, No. 20, Pg. 17

Japan's regulations are modelled closely on the US Orphan Drug Act of
1983.

In 1993, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) implemented Japan's
Orphan Drug Development System by revising Article 77 of the
Pharmaceutical Affairs Law.

Both orphan drugs and devices are covered.

To be designated as an orphan drug, a compound must meet the following
three conditions: (1) it must be a treatment for a rare disease which
affects less than 50,000 patients in Japan; (2) there must be a clear
demand for the compound, with no conventional medicine available; (3)
successful development of the compound must be possible.

Companies apply to MHW for their compound to be designated as an orphan
drug.

If approved, the Organisation for Adverse Drug Reaction Research (OADR)
steps in.

For approved orphan drugs, OADR provides the following incentives to
companies: (1) a grant to cover up to 50% of research and development
costs; (2) guidance and advice on the new drug approval process; (3) a
tax deduction of 6% of R&D costs (excluding the amount of grant
received), limited to 10% of corporation tax; (4) a fast track
providing the highest priority in the new drug approval examination
process; (5) if needed, an extension of the allowable period for
re-examination (the maximum is otherwise ten years).

As of Apr 1995, 80 drugs and four medical devices had been designated
under this procedure.

Most of Japan's orphan drugs have been developed by foreign companies.

Leaded petrol being phased out in Germany; sales of biodiesel set to
increase

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: OTIS News, 25 Oct 1996, Vol. 6, No. 20, Pg. 7-8

Leaded petrol is to be completely withdrawn from petrol stations
belonging to the German Oil Industry Association by the end of 1996.

Some pumps may instead provide biodiesel, but this sector is set to
continue as a niche market.

Over the last 10 years, the market share of leaded petrol has decreased
to less than 5%.

Annual lead emissions from traffic have therefore decreased from 5000
tonnes in 1984 to 400 tonnes in 1995.

The level of lead in blood has also decreased from an average of 80
ng/ml to 31 ng/ml within the same period.

Having almost completely removed lead, the next step was to reduce
benzene levels in fuels; a first step in this direction has been
achieved through the introduction of a low-benzene Super Plus petrol.

Annual sales of biodiesel, first introduced in Germany five years ago,
currently reach 50,000 tonnes from 500 outlets.

The Association for the Promotion of Oil and Protein Plants (UFOP)
estimates that 100 more petrol stations will be offering the fuel by
the end of 1997 and aims to reach 1000 outlets within five years.

Biodiesel, which is not subject to duty, is currently cheaper than its
conventional equivalent.

Its relative unavailability, however, presents a barrier to its wider
use.

Customs officers at Houston Intercontinental Airport recently opened a
container taken from a passenger of an extract, described as an
experimental pesticide, of the neem tree.

Four hours later fumes began emitting from the canister which were
carried by the ventilation system.

Several people reported headaches, nausea and dizziness and the
terminal was evacuated and closed for 3 hours.

Houston Fire Department's hazardous materials response team ruled the
material to be a non-toxic irritant and turned the canister over to EPA
(Environmental Protection Agency).

It is not known whether charges will be brought against the passenger.

16-17

Ciba Crop Protection has informed EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)
that complying with FIFRA (Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
Rodenticide Rule) Section 6(a)(2) adverse effects reporting rule places
a larger burden on pesticide registrants than had been expected.

Ciba fully supports the American Crop Protection Association's call to
lengthen the comment period available on the entire rule.

Ciba alone would need to train over 1,000 staff in the USA and an
undetermined number world-wide.

The requirement on registrants to report unexpected exposures when
there is no evidence of adverse effects could be dropped to save the
unnecessary reporting of thousands of unrelated incidents with no
bearing on the registration of the product.

The time taken for retroactive reviewing of company files has also been
grossly underestimated by EPA.

Greenpeace is stepping up its campaign against foods genetically
altered to resist pesticides.

In recent press briefings it highlights alleged environmental and
health dangers of Monsanto's Roundup-Ready soybeans and Ciba-Geigy's
genetically altered maize which are due to be marketed autumn 1996.

The research farm in Iowa of Asgrow Seed Co, recently bought by
Monsanto and selling some 80% of the company's genetically altered
seed, was vandalized.

In Europe the pressure group is pushing for the separation of
genetically engineered foods from other crops and for the banning of
the import of such foods.

Switzerland already requires the labelling of genetically altered foods
and Norway will not sell US soya products unless those genetically
altered are identified.

A German survey found that 85% of those polled did not want to consume
genetically altered foods.

However, Australia, Japan and the USA have approved modified soybeans
and maize.

Monsanto counters that one of the advantages of their introduction is
the lowering of pesticide use.

11-12

In its draft "Guide to clear labelling statements" the EPA
(Environmental Protection Agency) emphasises the need for clear and
concise labels.

Labels need to: identify the product and its contents and give
directions for use such that the product will function safely; specify
permitted uses; list non-pesticidal uses only if approved by another
federal agency; be free from statement contradictions.

Statements should be either directive, as required by law, or advisory.

The latter, with which users are not legally required to comply, may be
required by EPA to prevent unreasonable effects or may be voluntarily
added by the registrant.

A symposium on the FQPA (Food Quality Protection Act) was organized by
the Institute of Food Technologists in Oct 1996.

The Grocery Manufacturers of America believes that the Act will result
in the development of more biopesticides and plants genetically
engineered for pest resistance.

It expressed concern at the politicization of pesticide residues and
the level of civil penalties against food processors who violate
pesticide residue tolerances.

Further concern was the oestrogenic and cumulative effects of
pesticides.

The view was expressed that FQPA would encourage the employment of
minor use pesticides to the benefit of the food industry.

The Food Chain Coalition is to monitor implementation of FQPA and
encourage congressional interest as a means of retaining pesticides.

The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) is using a 7-year-old
Massachusetts' law as a guide to possible expansion of TRI (Toxics
Release Inventory) legislation.

MA passed its Toxics Use Reduction Act in 1989 requiring companies over
a certain size to halve toxic wastes over 10 years, prepare a materials
balance audit and present a flow diagram showing the fate of their
toxic materials.

A report needs to be filed every other year.

The companies are given technical assistance to comply through the
governing law.

Companies in the state reduced the use of toxics by 19% within 4 years
of implementation of the legislation.

The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) is hosting a series of public

business; violate rights not to disclose confidential business
information.

Contra views were expressed by consumer and public interest groups and

Several of the active substances currently approved for use in
vertebrate control are restricted to indoor use only.

No agreement on a definition of what is meant by indoors is so far been
agreed.

The consequence has been several enquiries to the Pesticides Safety
Directorate as to which situations come under the category of indoors.

Some pest control operators have defined open barns and rat holes as
indoors.

Relevant government departments and Committees, together with industry
have agreed the following definition of indoors: Situations where the
bait is placed within a building or other enclosed structure, and where
the target is living or feeding predominantly within that building or
structure.

The Pesticides Safety Directorate has also stated that any rodenticide
product approved for use indoors or outdoors can also be legally
applied in sewers.

Dacco Industries, thermoformer, has been purchased by ITW Electronic
Component Packaging Systems.

ITW concentrates on plastics packaging for the semiconductor and socket
and connector markets and Dacco is a good fit, with its niche in vacuum
forming thin-gauge multi-cavity tubes for connectors.

The plan is to expand into other market segments with Dacco, such as
packaging populated printed circuit boards and disk-drive components.

ITW Electronic Component Packaging already has five companies worldwide
making extruded and injection molded plastic packaging.

Through its ITW Meritex unit, the company extrudes shipping tubes,
primarily of PVC, in Arlington; and in Malacca and Pinang, Malaysia.

ITW Ampang of Baguio, Philippines, also extrudes shipping and handling
tubes, mainly for the Philippine market.

ITW Thielex extrudes packaging for the socket and connector market in
Somerset, NJ.

ITW Camtex, with operations in Arlington, Pinang and Fremont, CA,
injection molds engineered plastic trays and other packaging.

ITW C-Pak forms carbon-loaded, static-dissipative polystyrene tape for
packaging tiny electronic devices.

The tape is shipped to customers on reels.

EPA recommends recycled-content pallet rules

Ref: Plastics News, 4 Nov 1996, Vol. 8, No. Electronic version

Plastic shipping pallets purchased by the federal government could be
required to be made entirely of recycled plastic, according to a new
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal.

However, the order may be ignored by government purchasers as EPA
refers to no performance or product standards and allows great leeway
in its enforcement.

The effect on the US Postal Service is also unclear as the department
already has 3 M orange-and-black, 40-by-48-inch high molecular weight
polyethylene cargo pallets in use nationwide and is one of the biggest
users of plastic pallets in the world.

An improved engineering design has produced second-generation pallets
containing no more than 30% post industrial regrind and post-consumer
PE.

Specifications are being created now to cover the third generation,
which would probably call for not less than 30% post-consumer waste and
regrind.

Thermoforming is one of three commonly used plastic pallet
manufacturing processes.

Others are made of plastic lumber or structural foam molded.

twinjets manufactured by Boeing Co, replacing an aluminium sandwich
structure.

The composite material does not corrode and is lighter than its
aluminium counterpart.

Heat is also conducted away from the engine by the honeycomb acoustic
core wrapped around it.

For hard points on the inner core of the barrel, Amoco T300-1K
PAN-based fibre is used by Hexcel.

Amoco Performance Products is seeking to develop applications of their
conductive fibres in the electronics sector.

Opportunities also exist in the automotive sector.

Amoco unit feels heat to supply hot PAN: carbon fibre demand tight

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastics News, 23 Sep 1996, Vol. 8, No. 30, Pg. 11

Demand for carbon fibre for aerospace applications is growing rapidly,
led by an increase in the construction rate of commercial aircraft by
Boeing Co.

This has led to a shortage of supply.

Almost all of the output from Amoco Performance Products Inc's 2.2 M
lb/y PAN-based carbon fibre production capacity in Greenville, SC, is
for aerospace applications.

By 1997, availability of carbon fibre for sporting applications would
also be difficult, but there are a number of planned production
increases which should ease this situation.

Toray Industries Inc, Toho Rayon Co, Zoltek Cos Inc, Akzo Nobel NV and
RK International Ltd are all planning to raise capacity.

By the end of 1997, Amoco Performance Products plans to achieve full
capacity of 2 M lb/y at its facility in Rock Hill, SC.

The unit is undergoing refurbishment and debottlenecking.

Capacity amounting to 1 M lb/y was brought back onstream in late 1995.

EPL adding perforating lines for Mylar

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastics News, 23 Sep 1996, Vol. 8, No. 30, Pg. 8

Mylar metallized PET film, produced by DuPont for use in microwave
packaging, is to be perforated by EPL Technologies Inc.

This will enable steam to escape from the packaging during cooking,
thus maintaining the correct texture.

Two gas-flame perforating lines are to be installed by the company at
its Crystal Specialty Films facility in Oswego, IL.

Sales from the new production lines could amount to as much as $15 M/y.

Some DuPont films will be distributed by EPL Technologies under an
agreement which makes it the only company undertaking gas-flame
perforating for DuPont, for its plastic films made from polyethylene
naphthalate, PET and nylon.

Respire is an LDPE film produced by DuPont.

Currently it is being perforated for use in bread packaging by a UK
subsidiary of EPL Technologies, Bakery Packaging Services Ltd.

In due course, the company plans to market Respire in the US.

Ref: Plastics News, 23 Sep 1996, Vol. 8, No. 30, Pg. 4

A study by the Composites Fabricators Association has concluded that
the first action to be taken to reduce styrene emissions from open
moulds was to ensure that spray guns were properly set up and spraying
techniques properly carried out.

Spray tips should be properly adjusted with the gun being used at the
lowest practicable pressure.

Spray-off should be caught and operators adequately trained.

Further research is being carried out including the use of suppressants
for styrene and alternative application treatments.

In 1997, a maximum-available- control-technology is to be developed by
the EPA and this will be based on the research findings.

Paulstra, a member of the Hutchinson group and a European leader in
rubber processing, has been working for about 15 years on a range of
high performance silicone-based products called Paulstrasil foams.

Their chemical properties are distinct from those of other products due
to their unique chemical composition, based on a skeleton of
alternating silicone and oxygen atoms similar to that found in highly
heat-resistant materials such as quartz, glass and sand.

Their main characteristics are resistance to numerous agents including
ozone, chemicals, weather, radiation and high and low temperatures.

They offer good fire resistance without the release of toxic gas and
generate a very low density of smoke.

Initially developed for thermal protection in the aerospace industry,
Paulstrasil silicones are now finding application in many areas of
industry.

S Korea: JVs don't put much emphasis on domestic production

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Pharma Japan, 4 Nov 1996, No. 1523, Pg. 21

In 1H 1996 production of pharmaceuticals by 28 foreign-capitalised
companies in South Korea totalled $475 M, up 10.37% on 1H 1995.

The 28 companies are classified into 3 groups.

The first group, 9 companies lead by US corporations, increased
production by 5.2% to $138.5 M.

The second group, 13 companies lead by European concerns, increased
production 10.7% to $298.4 M; this group is more dependent on
foreign-made products.

The third group, 6 companies lead by Japanese firms, increased
production 30.3% to $37.9 M.

The drug production values of 20 major joint venture companies for 1H
1996 are listed.

The top 3 companies were Han Dok, Janssen Korea and Pfizer Korea, with
values of $86.8 M, $60.3 M and $39.9 M, respectively.

In general, joint ventures place more emphasis on imports than domestic
production because they find it difficult to cover all the risks
involved in their weak production structure.

Gist-brocades: production of clavulanic acid reaches advanced stage

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Gist, Autumn 1996, No. 66, Pg. 13-14

Gist-brocades' new clavulanic acid plant in Strangnas, Sweden, is now
on stream.

The first kilograms of product were released in Sep 1996.

Clavulanic acid offers an attractive opportunity for Gist-brocades.

As patent protection starts to expire, this presents an opportunity to
enter the market for generic bulk clavulanic acid.

The production of potassium clavulanate is a natural extension of the
company's core activities.

It is produced by large-scale fermentation.

Clavulanic acid is at present marketed by SmithKline Beecham who hold
patents on it, and recently a few generic suppliers have also entered
the market.

Several patents have expired or will soon.

In the very near future, patents related to the therapeutic use of
clavulanic acid in combination with beta-lactams like amoxicillin will
be expiring as well, or have already expired.

In Jul 1996 the European Patent Office granted a patent on a process to
purify clavulanic acid.

The development of additional cost-effective processes is in the phase
of completion and patent applications will be submitted soon.

The European Pharmacopoeia Commission has granted a Certificate of
Suitability (CoS) for potassium clavulanate produced in the
Netherlands.

It will soon be followed by a CoS for the material produced in Sweden.

The industrial quantities now being produced in Sweden will enable
customers to penetrate the market with generic clavulanic acid.

Gist-brocades' objective is to become market leader in the generic
supply of bulk clavulanic acid.

It is aiming for a global presence.

Ref: The Gist, Autumn 1996, No. 66, Pg. 11-12

Over the last year-and-half Gist-brocades' Bakery Ingredients Division
(BID) has been expanding its presence, especially in Latin America.

In a series of strategic acquisitions and participations most parts of
this vast continent are now covered by the division's operations.

The aim is to further increase this network and obtain a significant
market share for yeast and bakery ingredients.

An interview with Bert Jongejan, Managing Director of the BID, is
presented which fills in the background to this expansion, which fits
in perfectly with the BID's global strategy.

Gist-brocades is market leader in Chile for yeast as well as for bakery
ingredients.

Gist-brocades has been carefully looking for partnerships and take-over
candidates and in several countries has been successful.

In 1997 Gist-brocades will be changing its focus to another continent:
Asia.

Potentially Asia is a huge market for all its products.

Nutrition is a target area for an increasing number of food and
pharmaceutical companies wishing to focus on the development of foods
for specific population segments.

The recent major product developments of Gist-brocades in this area are
outlined.

Gist-brocades has developed a proprietary large-scale production
process for arachidonic acid (ARA), and is performing application
studies on ARA-oil and DHA-oil, in cooperation with a number of infant
formula companies.

Commercial introduction is expected by the end of 1996.

In collaboration with the US company Agennix Inc, Gist-brocades is
producing human lactoferrin through fermentation of the fungus
Aspergillus awamori.

The efficacy of human lactoferrin is being evaluated in a variety of
applications.

The quest for natural food products has increased the interest in new
sources of beta-carotene.

Gist-brocades has developed a production technology using large-scale
fermentation of the fungus Blakeslea trispora.

Commercial quantities are expected in early 1997.

Gist-brocades: the global approach

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Gist, Autumn 1996, No. 66, Pg. 3-5

IPPD, the Industrial Pharmaceutical Products Division of Gist-brocades,
has grown enormously over the past few years.

Nowadays, it is a division with locations all over the the world and
with a turnover in 1995 of HFL 665 M.

In recent months, a number of acquisitions, joint ventures and
strategic alliances have been announced.

New plants for clavulanic acid and 7-ACA have been built.

Production sites in the Netherlands and Mexico have been inspected by
the US FDA.

This article attempts to put recent developments into perspective,
giving an update of IPPD's present position and future plans.

Recently, Gist-brocades became the 100% owner of Orfaquim Gist-brocades
in Mexico and of Acopharma (now called Gist-brocades Egypt SAE).

Both these companies produce bulk actives: Orfaquim Gist-brocades
produces sterile penicillins, Gist-brocades Egypt semi-synthetic
penicillins.

Gist-brocades now produces penicillins in China, Great Britain, India,
Mexico, The Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden.

Locations outside Europe are becoming increasingly important.

The Mexican joint venture, Fersinsa Gist-brocades, has recently
increased its output substantially.

In India a plant for 7-ACA has been built by MAX-Gb and in Sweden, IPPD
built a plant for clavuanic acid.

Over the past few years, IPPD has increased its number of sales offices
considerably.

Gist-brocades: half-yearly figures 1996: distinct increase in 1H profit

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Gist, Autumn 1996, No. 66, Pg. 2

The profit after taxation of Royal Gist-Brocades NV for the first six
months of 1996 came to HFL 69.7 M.

This is an increase of 8.2% on 1H 1995.

Since changes in exchange rates were minor, their impact on this growth
was limited.

Operating profit grew 10% to HFL 87.9 M.

The results of the Industrial Pharmaceutical Products Division were
virtually the same as those for 1H 1995, whereas profitability at the
Bakery Ingredients and Food Specialties Divisions distinctly improved.

Consolidated net turnover amounted to HFL 980.8 M, up more than 10% on
1H 1995.

HFL 90 M of the 1996 turnover relates to new acquisitions.

Organic growth in turnover amounted to 8%.

Gist-brocades expects the net profit for the whole of 1996 to be
distinctly higher than that for the whole of 1995.

Sales of yeast and bakery ingredients increased strongly.

This was the result of acquisitions in Spain and Latin America and
rising fresh and dry yeast selling prices.

Turnover of industrial pharmaceutical products was also up.

This is the result partly of acquisitions and partly of organic growth.

Profit remained at much the same level.

Acquisitions brought expansion to the dairy and beverage ingredient
operations.

Combined with steady further growth in the other activities, this
resulted in a considerable increase in turnover.

Titan Tire picks Texas site for plant

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Rubber and Plastics News II, 28 Oct 1996, Vol. 18, No. 2, Pg. 8

$100 M is to be invested at Brownsville, TX, by Titan Tire Corp in
production facilities for speciality off-the-road tyres.

Completion of the first phase of the development is due by the end of
summer 1997.

Sales from the unit are expected to be $200- 250 M/y, increasing the
company's tyre sales to a total of $600- 700 M/y.

Initial production is expected to be of large agricultural tyres. 30%
of the demand for bias tyres by the speciality aftermarket is supplied
by Titan Tire, and the company is also responsible for the supply of
10-12% of radial tyre demand.

It aims to increase this to 40%.

Strike, or other action, has been rejected by workers at Semperit
Reifen AG, against Continental AG's plans to reduce production and
staffing levels at the production facility in Traiskirchen, Austria.

Passenger tyre capacity at the unit will be cut by 14% to 3.5 M
units/y, although output planned in 1997 is only 2 M units.

Capacity for truck tyres is 500,000 units/y and this is expected to
operate at 85% capacity in 1997.

Equipment will be moved from the site to Continental Barum SRO, based
at Otrokovice, Czech Republic.

The company is increasing capacity at this site by 50%.

When Austria joined the European Union, the demand for its tyres from
Japanese car manufacturers disappeared.

Production will be increased at Traiskirchen if suitable contracts can
be negotiated.

Raisio: Jan-Aug 1996 results

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Raisio Group Interim Report 1 Jan-31 Aug 1996, 15 Oct 1996, Pg. 1-4

Raisio Group's turnover for the 1 Jan-31 Aug 1996 period was FM 2476 M,
up 20% compared with the same period in 1995.

International turnover doubled, reaching FM 945 M, or 38% of total
turnover.

Exports from Finland grw 68%, totalling 487 M.

The Jan-Aug profit before extraordinary items was FM 91.5 M, accounting
for 3.7% of turnover.

The result improved markedly on Jan-Apr but was weaker than in the
corresponding period in 1995.

The Chemicals Division improved its result, following the slight slump
around the turn of the year.

The consolidated operating margin was FM 267.8 M, accounting for 10.8%
of turnover.

The amount remained roughly on the 1995 level.

Net financial expense came to FM 32.1 M, against FM 33.9 M a year
earlier.

The targeted consolidated turnover continues to be FM 4 bn.

The financial result is expected to fall just slightly short of that
for 1995.

The Group's gross investments in Jan-Aug were FM 126 M, or 5.1% of
turnover.

The expansion of the margarine plant in Poland, construction of the
Animal Feeds Division's meal storage facility in Raisio and initial
investments in the stanol ester production plant were the principal
investments.

For the corresponding period in 1995, investments were FM 246 M.

Total investments for the 1996 financial year were expected to reach FM
230 M.

In terms of the entire year, the principal investment is processing of
plant sterols.

As of the beginning of 1996, Raisio Engineering Ltd and Flootek AB,
which operates in Sweden, were made subsidiaries of Raisio Chemicals
Ltd.

Roe Lee Canada Inc changed its name to Raisio Chemicals Canada Inc and
the business operations of Diachem Industries Ltd were merged with it
from the beginning of Jun.

The margarine plant bought in Poland last Dec was inaugurated in Aug,
following renovation and expansion.

The Polish subsidiary is targeting a FM 300 M turnover this year.

Production of margarines for the Polish market has now been transferred
to the enlarged plant, which has a capacity of some 60 M kilos/y of
margarine.

Sales of malts to Finnish breweries decreased slightly on the previous
year.

Exports, however, grew substantially, accounting for 70% of the Malting
Subdivision's FM 81 M turnover.

As public concern shifts away from the problem of solid waste, plastics
companies are turning their attention away from expensive programmes to
recycle plastics to other, more profitable, areas.

At Piscataway, NJ, Union Carbide is to close its HDPE recycling
facility.

Quantum Chemical Co closed a similar unit at Heath, OH, 18 months ago.

On 1 Oct 1996, declining funding from industry will force the closure
of the Center for Plastics Recycling Research, based at Rutgers
University.

The requirement for a minimum recycled content in food packaging in
California, LA, has been dropped from the state's recycling
legislation.

The American Plastics Council is no longer aiming at a 25% recycling
target for rigid bottles and containers.

The plastics industry is now concentrating its efforts on wider
environmentally friendly programmes.

Recyclers optimistic despite setbacks

Plastics recyclers have to overcome the problems associated with
collection, sorting and reprocessing for a variety of plastics.

One of the major problems facing the sector is the low price of virgin
resin, making recycling less profitable.

Several recyclers have close because of the low profitability,
including Quantum Chemical Co and Union Carbide Corp, which have closed
their HDPE recycling operations.

Wellman Inc is the biggest recycler of PET worldwide and runs a
profitable operation, with sales of over $1 bn/y.

However, it is finding profitability falling as prices fall.

In 1995, 622 M lbs of PET was recycled in the US according to the
National Association for Plastic Container Recovery.

Loosefill packaging is proving a significant niche market for recyclers
of polystyrene. 10 M lb/y of polystyrene packaging containing 35%
recycled material is made by Free-Flow Packaging Corp. 300,000-400,000
lb/month of polyethylene film is recycled by Sonoco Products Co.

This mainly comes from T-shirt bags and pallet wrap.

The company is finding it difficult to obtain sufficient material for
recycling and is encouraging consumers to return the bags to grocery
stores.

Canada probes dumping charge for polyisocyanurate thermal insulation from
the US

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastics News, 30 Sep 1996, Vol. 8, No. 31, Pg. 3

A complaint has been made to the Canadian government by Exeltherm Inc,
claiming that polyisocyanurate thermal insulation is being dumped there
by US producers.

The complaint, relating to the six months ended 30 Jun 1996, will be
investigated by Revenue Canada.

Antidumping duties will be levied if the charges are upheld.

In 1995, more than 50% of Canada's production of polyisocyanurate board
was manufactured by Exeltherm.

Canadian demand was estimated at 207 M board feet.

Chapparal buy provides ITW cast-film niche

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastics News, 30 Sep 1996, Vol. 8, No. 31, Pg. 1,27

Chapparal Films Inc has been acquired by Illinois Tool Works Inc for an
undisclosed sum.

Polyethylene films are produced on two cast film lines at Mauriceville,
TX. 60% of the company's cast film output uses metallocene polymers.

The five-layers films are sold primarily for pallet wrap.

ITW Mima is responsible for the plastic film operations of Illinois
Tool Works, and it plans to begin production of blown stretch film at a
new facility in Waterford, Ireland, by the end of 1996.

Output from the new unit will be sold in Europe.

Capacity for stretch film is to be expanded by Intertape Polymer Group
Inc at Danville, VA, at a cost of $17 M.

The expansion will raise capacity to 100 M lb/y.

Deerfield Plastics Co is to be acquired by Huntsman Packaging Corp,
expanding the latter's capacity for production of polyethylene pallet
wrap.

Within the next 12 months, capacity for cast and blown stretch film
will be expanded in the US and Canada by Sigma Plastics.

By Apr 1997, at least 75 M lb/y capacity for cast and blown stretch PE
films is to be brought onstream by Armin Plastics, with an investment
of $15 M.

Capacity for production of pallet wrap is estimated to be 30% greater
than demand.

Stretch film capacity is estimated at 1.2 bn lb/y, 10% higher than
demand.

In Oct 1996, the purchase of Borden Global Packaging by AEP is due to
be completed.

This will considerably increase AEP's potential sales of PE stretch
pallet wrap, which currently stand at $96 M/y.

Plastics recycling: time for last rites?

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Plastics News, 30 Sep 1996, Vol. 8, No. 31, Pg. 1,6

On 31 Aug 1996, the requirement in California for a minimum recycled
content in plastic products was effectively repealed, supported by
resin producers and retail merchants.

The American Plastics Council denies that it has not given sufficient
support to efforts to recycle plastics.

It is accused of leaving the organisation of collection programmes to
local authorities.

However, these have found it difficult to get a return from plastics
recycling.

One problem being faced is the low cost of virgin resins.

Over 1990-1995, $1 bn was invested by the plastics industry to support
recycling initiatives by local communities.

New, non-yellowing resin from Croda

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Press Release,  7 Nov 1996, 1 p

Croda Resins has developed a new, acrylic hybrid resin that is designed
to overcome the coatings problems of yellowing, particularly in areas
that are shaded from direct sunlight.

The new material, Crodaplast AC-300, also offers faster touch dry and
through dry times, excellent water resistance and good exterior
durability.

These benefits are the result of combining Croda's expertise in
air-drying and acrylic polymer technology.

Crodaplast AC-300 can be used in quality decorative or industrial
finishes.

It is ideal for use in interior household paints where non-yellowing
and humidity resistance are of paramount importance e.g. kitchens and
bathrooms.

Also, its exterior durability, fast dry and early water resistance make
it a good choice for exterior maintenance or agricultural machinery
coatings.

Blending Crodaplast AC-300 with other novel materials from Croda offers
the formulator even more interesting possibilities.

Highly flexible, long life coatings for wood (both interior and
exterior) can be formulated by blending with Crodapol 0-78, a
flexibilising material.

High solids (low VOC) air-drying coatings are produced when Croda
Dilulin is used as a reactive diluent.

Nagoya, Japan.

The steel vessel is designed to operate for 20 years without
dry-docking.

Chevron Nigeria and its joint venture partner, the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp (NNPC), initiated the Escravos Gas Project to reduce gas
flaring and recover the gas and condensate from the company's offshore
oil production, which is at its current peak production of 405,000
barrels/day.

Under the project the gas will be pumped to an onshore gas processing
plant.

Once there, three products will be produced: condenstate for blending
with exported crude oil, natural gas for distribution within Nigeria,
and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for export from the new FSO vessel.

The FSO will chill, de-pressurize, and store the LPG for export on LPG
tankers.

Ref: Press Release,  7 Nov 1996, 2 pp

The Lonza Group's Polymers and Additives Business Unit is to build a
70,000 tons/y purified isophthalic acid plant in Singapore.

The total capital investment for the plant will amount to approx $125
M.

The project will be a joint venture, with Lonza contributing 80% and
the Economic Development Board of Singapore (governmental agency for
the promotion of foreign investments) the remaining 20%.

The plant is scheduled to come on stream at the end of 1998.

The new production site will be located on the Island of Pulau Sakra,
west of Singapore's central business district, and have a total size of
75,000 sq m including land reserves for future projects.

Isophthalic acid is a plastic intermediate used in the manufacture of
unsaturated polyesters resins and environmentally friendly,
water-based, solvent-free coatings and paints as well as
polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) bottle-grade resins.

A number of further applications are still in the development phase.

The manufacturing process used in the new plant is based on a
proprietary liquid phase oxidation technology developed by Lonza.

A similar process has been successfully utilized at Lonza's trimellitic
anhydride production unit in Italy.

The isophthalic acid production will be backwards integrated, with a
separation unit that will produce the starting material from mixed
xylenes widely available from the local petrochemical refineries.

The realization of the isophthalic acid plant will enable Lonza to
broaden its product range, to particpate in the fast growing
Asian-Pacific market and to strengthen its position as a leading
manufacturer of plastic intermediates.

Quidel taps new H. Pylori market opportunity, company is first to offer an
H. Pylori test to all physicians without government limitation

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: Press Release,  23 Oct 1996, 2 pp

Quidel Corp has announced receipt of "waived categorization" for its
QuickVue One-Step H.

Pylori Test under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of
1988.

The QuickVue product is the first H. pylori test to receive such
categorization from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC).

The CDC classifies a product as waived if it is accurate and easy to
use.

Waived categorization enables the product to be sold to all physicians.

H. pylori is the bacterium that causes most stomach ulcers and is
strongly believed to be associated with the development of stomach
cancer.

Once an H. pylori infection is detected, antibiotic therapy is
administered to kill the organism and promote a cure of the ulcer
condition.

Quidel was first to introduce a rapid diagnostic test that detects H.
pylori.

The QuickVue One-Step H.

Pylori Test is the world's first non-invasive, one-step, blood test
that provides immediate and accurate diagnosis in minutes from a
finger-stick.

"With waived-testing status for H. pylori, we have an additional sales
opportunity with those doctors who are not certified to perform more
complex tests, and until now, could not provide H. pylori testing for
their patients," said Steven T Frankel, Quidel President and Chief
Executive Officer.

"Our QuickVue test gives these 'waived-only' sites, representing about
one-third of all doctors' office practices, direct control over the
testing and treatment of their patients during a single office visit."

Gist-brocades enters a new market sector: lovastatin

from CHEMICAL BUSINESS NEWSBASE, 12 Nov 1996

Ref: The Gist, Autumn 1996, No. 66, Pg. 15-16

Recently, it was announced that Gist-brocades is going to produce
lovastatin.

Lovastatin is a cholesterol-reducing drug which is still protected by
patents, but this protection will expire in the coming years.

Worldwide, there is a great demand for cholesterol-reducing drugs and
since lovastatin can be produced by fermentation, Gist-brocades is
interested in adding this product to its portfolio.

The worldwide annual turnover in cholesterol-reducing products amounts
to more than $5 bn and still shows a healthy growth.

This is particularly so for the 'statins'.

In 1995 demand grew by 24%.

Lovastatin is marketed by Merck, Sharpe and Dohme.

World sales of lovastatin (brand name Mevacor) were $1.26 bn in 1995.

The main market is the USA, where patent protection for lovastatin
expires in 2001.

Since Gist-brocades wants to carve its own position in the generics
market, it has been decided to make this product.

The position of the company will be that of a supplier of bulk actives.

Gist-brocades has a dedicated lovastatin plant under construction that
will comply with cGMP production.

Production will commence early in 1997.

industry in dealing with the varied and complex problems of handling
hazardous wastes.
   The book has fourteen chapters and six appendixes. The chapters cover
the following topics: Introduction to hazardous wastes; toxicology and risk
assessment; environmental legislation and regulations; hazardous waste
characterization, sampling, and analysis; pollution prevention and waste
minimization; chemical and physical treatment; biological treatment;
thermal processes; treatment process and facility siting; transportation
and storage of hazardous wastes; groundwater contamination; landfill and
injection well disposal; environmental audits and site assessment; and site
remediation.
   The topics included in the appendixes are: Priority pollutants;
hazardous wastes from nonspecific sources; hazardous wastes from specific
sources; listing of EPA hazardous wastes from commercial chemical products,
intermediates, and residues; useful conversion factors; and periodic chart
of elements, atomic numbers, and atomic weights.
   Most of the chapters contain questions or problems, and all have fairly
up-to-date bibliographies. Many, especially the ones on treatment
processes, contain much useful information.

ENVIRONMENTAL FIRMS REACT TO A COOLER MARKET
New demands, slower growth, and uncertainty are reshaping environmental
services

By:
Nicholas Basta, with David Veasey

MERGERS SIGNAL INCREASED COMPETITITON

In response to customers' demands for consolidated services, more companies
have been joining forces. Some linkages have been between two
environmental service firms. Others, such as Fluor's merger with
Groundwater Technology, allied an environmental remediation specialist with
$178 million in 1995 revenues, with an expert in engineering and
construction whose revenues last year topped $8.5 billion. Dow Radian
(Austin, Tex.), Dow's merger with Radian, similarly, combined two companies
with different areas of expertise. The company expects some $400 million
in bookings this year.
   Other acquisitions and mergers colored the U.S environmental services
market last year. OHM Inc. (Findley, Ohio), for example, expanded its
hazardous-waste remediation business by acquiring the hazwaste and radwaste
divisions of Rust International, a subsidiary of WMX Technologies (Oak
Brook, Ill.). As part of the deal, WMX will own part of OHM.

In addition:
-- Geraghty & Miller (Plainview, N.Y.) bought Piedmont Olsen Hensley, a
Greenville, S.C., E&C firm.
-- Earth Tech (Long Beach, Calif.) bought Barett Consulting Group (Menlo
Park, Calif.), a water and infrastructure firm.
-- Roy F. Weston (West Chester, Pa.) formed a partnership with The Eicon
Group, a bioremediation firm in New Haven, Conn.
-- Tetra Tech, Inc. (Pasadena, Calif.) bought PRC Environmental Management
(Alexandria, Va.).
-- Allwaste (Houston) bought Ecova Corp.'s In-Plant Service business.
-- Thermo Remediation Inc. (Waltham, Mass.) plans to buy Remediation
Technologies, Inc. (Concord, Mass.) for $33.3 million. Thermo Process
Systems bought Lancaster Laboratories (Lancaster, Pa.) for about $25
million. r



Even though their revenues set records last year, environmental equipment
and services companies know that the days of double digit U.S. market
growth are over. For one thing, their business has matured, and, as CPI
plants better control and reduce their emissions, there is a less urgent
need for their products.
   In addition, customers' demands are becoming more sophisticated. 
Instead of asking for simple environmental project management, downsized
government agencies and companies now want a full array of consulting
resources to help them stay competitive. ``Our clients want help managing
the whole problem, not just effluents at the end of the pipe,'' says Ellen
Leinfuss, vice-president for marketing for Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.
(Branchburg, N.J.), which is moving into an integrated environmental and
resource-management position.
    In response, more companies in the environmental sector are linking up
with each other, or with engineering and construction firms, to meet
changing needs in a future that still looks unclear (Box, p. 39). The trend
to ``one stop'' consulting is evidenced by last quarter's merger between
Radian Corp. (Austin, Tex.) and Dow Chemical Co. (Midland, Mich.),
combining process design and remediation knowhow. Similarly, last month's
merger between Fluor Daniel, Inc. (Irvine, Calif.) and Groundwater
Technology, Inc. (GTI; Norwood, Mass.) united engineering and construction
with remediation expertise. As Walter Barber, president of the new
company, Fluor Daniel/GTI, explains, the merger came mainly in response to
the changing needs of the U.S. Dept. of Defense (Washington, D.C.), a major
force in the soil remediation market. ``They want to deal with engineering
companies much larger than most environmental firms.''

Market growth slows
No doubt, slowing market growth is also helping to shape environmental
equipment and service companies' strategies. As more of their business
segments top out, conditions will soon become cutthroat if the current
trends continue. Take the flat, but sizeable, $9-billion market for soil
and groundwater remediation. If demand dips to $8 billion, says Barber,
``We'll see a real identification of winners and losers.''
   Clearly, U.S. demand for environmental products and services sector has
been increasing, but, since 1993, its growth has been slowing, and it has
been shrinking as a percentage of capital spending. In its 1995 member
survey, the U.S. Chemical Manufacturers Assn. (CMA; Washington, D.C.) found
that, while overall capital spending increased by 25% between 1993 and
1996, spending on the environment dropped from 16.8% of all capital
spending in 1993 to 13.3% last year. In 1996, members expect it to drop to
10% of spending.
   Some analysts see the U.S. environmental market doing only about one
percentage point better than the overall economy. Between 1993 and 1998,
growth should stand at 3.9%/yr, with overall revenues moving from $133.5 to
$162.1 billion (Table, p. 39), according to Environmental Business
International (EBI; San Diego, Calif.).
   One standout among types of pollution spending has been air pollution
control, although EBI notes that growth has been slowing and revenues
declining since 1993. Last year, the analysts say, the market totalled $12
billion, as opposed to $13.5 billion for water pollution control equipment
and chemicals. Between 1993 and 1994, demand grew by 1.7%, and it should
continue at 2% until 1998.
   In the air-pollution-control equipment segment, volatile organic
compound (VOC) recovery systems, particularly regenerative thermal
oxidizers, have been a stellar product, according to Bob McIlvaine,
president of The McIlvaine Co. (Northbrook, Ill.). Demand for the units,
which burn flammable VOCs, sometimes with the use of supplemental natural
gas, has gone from $8 million to over $350 million.

Exports: uncharted territory
An unexplored market for many U.S. companies is exports, according to EBI. 
``The very size of the U.S. market has bred complacency and an
unwillingness to expand beyond U.S. borders,'' notes EBI president, Grant
Ferrier. In addition, management of water, sewage, and other municipal
works has not been privatized in the U.S. Other factors, he says, are lack
of sufficient market intelligence and government support, although the
picture is starting to change (p. 46).
   A closer look at the numbers shows that hazardous waste management and
waste management equipment will shrink during the five-year period. The
stand-out growth prospect is ``process and prevention technology,''
expected to leap by 15% -- but from $800 million, the smallest base of any
of the categories analyzed.
   Combined, resource recovery -- primarily municipal waste incineration --
and environmental energy sources, including biomass and other alternative
energy sources, will grow from just over $17 billion to $23 billion in
1998. While this growth is respectable, it wasn't so long ago that
forecasts called for municipal waste incineration to reach the $100-billion
mark by the year 2000.
   Meanwhile, the hazardous waste disposal sector is bearing the brunt of
pollution prevention efforts, with disposed volumes having declined now for
several years. ``There are fewer regulatory drivers to waste disposal that
fueled the industry growth in the 1980s, and the tremendous emphasis on
waste reduction has impacted our landfill and incineration facilities,''
says Kevin Igli, vice president for environmental management at Chemical
Waste Management, a subisidiary of WMX Technologies, Inc. (Oak Brook,
Ill.).
   But, reflecting the current trend, CWM, too, is getting into the waste
reduction business, he says. ``Previously, we simply picked up the waste at
the plant gate; now, we're going into the plant to help companies develop
waste- reduction schemes.''
   Igli also sees a potentially dramatic change looming in proposed rules
from EPA concerning waste definitions and delisting. A new Hazardous Waste
Identification Rule (HWIR) has been issued that combines risk analysis with
chemical analysis of waste streams, along with a strategy for treatment.
``Waste generators will be in a position of trying to decide whether they
want to handle qualified materials as industrial, rather than hazardous,
waste streams, and deciding what level of treatment they want.''
   If more wastes get delisted, and sent to regular landfills rather than
secured hazwaste fills, the business could take another hit. But the same
companies might be expanding their waste-treatment operations, or their
analytical and consulting work.

Regulatory uncertainty's a factor
Looming in the background is the antiregulatory climate in Washington that
has been intensifying since Republicans gained control of Congress in late
1994. While there shouldn't be a dramatic drop in environmental spending,
and most observers say companies will still have to meet existing or
tougher standards, Congress has been sending clear signals that it wants
regulators off industry's back, and chemical manufacturing companies aren't
complaining. ``Our members continue to find that you get back only about 10
cents on the dollar invested in environmental activity,'' notes Alan Lenz,
chief economist for the U.S. Chemical Manufacturing Assn. (CMA; Washington,
D.C.). And this, he says, takes into account lower disposal costs,
recovered byproducts and other benefits.
   Instead of celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, Washington, D.C.) spent a good part
of last year worrying about its survival. Only a veto by President
Clinton in December saved its enforcement budget from a 21% funding cut
that, according to assistant EPA administrator Fred Hanson, would have left
it ``unable to ensure continued protection of the environment.''
   At a time when Clean Air Act amendments call for hiring new enforcement
personnel, EPA has had to cut staff. ``We have to do more with less, but
the solution is to work smarter [and not simply cut funding],'' Hanson told
CE at a press conference at the Environmental Champions awards (CE,
November, p. 54) presentation in New York last month.
   Overshadowing Congressional debate has been some nasty confrontation
over the budget, and the drive for a balanced budget by 2002. One way that
Republican legislators have made their views known is by sponsoring riders
on budget bills or other unrelated legislation. So far, they have proposed
such measures as stopping EPA review of Army Corps of Engineers' wetlands
permitting, preventing expansion of the Toxics Release Inventory, and
delaying application of Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT)
air-emission standards for petroleum refiners. These and other riders
continuously appeared during the summer and fall despite a House vote to
omit riders from agency appropriations. However, this year, MACT standards
are expected to be issued for air emissions from refineries.
   Another potential blow to environmental enforcement was the passage last
year of the Unfunded Mandates bill. By blocking enforcement programs whose
funding has not already been assured by individual state budgets, the bill
could have a significant impact on a number of environmental regulations.

Legislation in limbo
At the same time, key pieces of legislation remain suspended in Congress,
and it is still too soon to tell whether Superfund, the Safe Drinking Water
Act, the Clean Water Act, or Regulatory Reform will pass next year. The
Clean Water Act (CWA) reauthorization bill (H.R. 961) passed the House last
spring, but is hung up in the Senate as debate continues over non-point
pollution sources, and whether the agricultural sector should be included.
Eventually, CWA could become primarily an enforcement program.
   For Superfund, the big sticking point is retroactive liability, while
the Safe Drinking Water Act, once bolstered by bipartisan support, has also
run into objections. A Senate reauthorization bill has been called ``one
large, unfunded mandate'' by critics, who expect it to double or triple the
costs of water systems nationally. Although the bill has been passed by
the House, it remains stalled in the Senate.
   The Takings Bill, which would have the government pay landowners whose
property is devalued because of regulations, was approved by the House and
has passed the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Endangered Species Act
reauthorization, which would cut protective regulation, has been passed by
the House, but has not yet been acted upon by the Senate.
   Industry representatives and conservative policymakers who support
Republican-sponsored environmental regulatory reform say that their goals
are to rationalize environmental policies in an age of limited public
resources. ``We seek to streamline the process, to make it less oppressive
and wasteful,'' says Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum
Institute (Washington, D.C.), in a speech at the association's annual
meeting last November.
   Clinton Administration officials use similar reformatory terms in
describing their goals, but draw a line at EPA funding. ``Congressional
proposals to slash EPA budgets are absolutely unacceptable,'' says Elaine
Kamarck, senior policy advisor to Vice President Al Gore. The key to
effective policy, she adds, is making enforcement more selective by
identifying problem generators, and emphasizing compliance, rather than
``ticket-writing.''
   Many in the environmental business are calling for more-rational
environmental planning, grounded in economic reality. ``There [are more
than enough] laws on the books for protecting the environment,'' says Fluor
Daniel/GTI's president Barber. ``Over the next five years, we should shift
away from regulatory, and toward economic, drivers.''
   The current regulatory climate could help foster useful activities, he
says. Among examples he cites are recovering value by reclaiming
chemicals, either from waste streams or as part of pollution-prevention
programs, using remediated sites, or ``brownfields'' for industrial
purposes, rather than restoring them to pristine conditions, and reducing
liability for insurance purposes.
   Environmentalists, meanwhile, are gravely concerned about the fallout
from the Republican agenda. ``[Reform is] a blatant repeal of environmental
protections that would provide many opportunities for legal challenges, and
would tie regulations up in bureaucratic red tape,'' says John Kostayack,
an attorney with the National Wildlife Federation (Washington, D.C.).

Consensus on risk assessment?
One area where some consensus is shaping up is in risk assessment and
management. EPA itself has several programs in the works to allow for
greater use of risk assessment in making priority choices in pollution
control, and in evaluating hazards.
   A risk assessment provision that would call for detailed risk versus
benefit analysis before any environmental regulation is issued, passed the
House last February as part of a regulatory reform bill (H.R. 1022). The
Senate version (S.343) has since been bottled up in committee.
Nevertheless, the House bill offers a sound scientific way to calculate
potential risk from chemicals, says Dr. George Gray, deputy director of the
Harvard University School of Public Health's Center for Risk Analysis
(Cambridge, Mass.). ``We need to get away from a single number [for
calculating risk] and consider the range of potential effects.'' EPA's
reliance on worst-case scenarios and linear dose-responses tars many
chemicals with the same brush, he says, and does nothing to allay public
fears about risk.
   Of course, it remains to be seen whether risk assessment and other key
elements of Republican reform actually wind up changing any environmental
regulations. U.S. environmental firms are not waiting to find out, though,
as they prepare to face a very different business in the future.

MOLECULAR MODELING IT'S NOT JUST FOR CHEMISTS ANYMORE
More chemical engineers are using new models to speed up product design and
testing

By:
AGNES SHANLEY
Gerald Parkinson with Ken Fouhy


Imagine dreaming up the perfect chemical product, feeding its properties
into a computer and getting, not just a model of that product, but
blueprints of the whole process for making it. Sound futuristic? It's
already happening, as more chemical engineers tap into molecular modeling
and combinatorial chemistry techniques (Box, p. 33) to speed up product
design and to avoid the costly trial and error of physical tests.
   Molecular modeling was once the exclusive domain of chemists, who apply
the concept on the microscopic, structural level. Now, chemical engineers
are modeling on the macroscopic level, examining chemical groups rather
than elements, explains Rafiqul Ghani, head of the University of Denmark's
(Lyngby) Computer Aided Molecular Design program. The results are already
showing up in better products, environmentally benign processes, and
improved equipment, at a fraction of the typical product development cost.
   This new market, in turn, is driving the development of more
user-friendly modeling packages, incorporating expert systems and extensive
databases. It has also played some part in the merger between California
based Biosym Technologies and Molecular Simulations, Inc. (MSI; Medford,
Mass.) last August. The new company, Biosym/MSI, Inc. (San Diego), is
strengthening its push outside the pharmaceutical market into new materials
development.
   Reverse engineering or ``retrosynthesis'' (CE, July, 1995, p. 33) is the
basis of molecular modeling, which starts with the concept for a new
product, then works backward to develop a way to make it.
``Computationally, this becomes very intensive,'' says Jeremy Winter,
manager of Courtaulds plc's (Coventry, U.K.) theory and modeling group,
which is applying the concept to design polymers for synthetic fibers.
   For complex molecules, which can require gigabytes of data storage
space, supercomputers are still needed, but they're no longer a
prerequisite for modeling. New packages running on workstations and even
PCs are taking modeling far beyond the laboratory.
   Illustrating the trend are two PC-based packages that will be introduced
commercially this month: Cranium (diagram, p. 31), which features a
built-in database and expert system to calculate physical properties, is
offered by Molecular Knowledge Systems (MKS; Nashua, N.H.), while
BatchDesign-Kit, a proces synthesis program for pharmaceuticals and
specialty chemicals, is offered by Gensym Corp. (Cambridge, Mass). Built
onto Gensym's G2 expert system, it allows users to optimize the
environmental performance of their processes as they do simulations and
develop flow and recipe sheets.

Environmental modeling
Such products are sure of a market, as more companies in the chemical
process industries (CPI) turn to molecular modeling to cut development
costs and time. Environmental pressures have driven many of their projects.
DuPont Co. (Wilmington, Del.), for example, used software from Gaussian,
Inc. (Pittsburgh, Pa.) and other programs to come up with routes to
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) substitutes.
   Far from research oddities, the results include such molecules as
HFC-134a, which is now in commercial production at several plants. Modeling
a typical set of thermodynamic calculations took under a week and cost
under $5,000, less than one tenth the cost of physical experiments, says
David Dixon, former research leader in computational chemistry at DuPont. 
He is now associate director for theory, modeling and simulation at
Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (Richland, Wash.), which
is modeling cleanup methods for mixed wastes containing radioactive and
chlorinated organic compounds.
   Others have used modelling to design the right catalyst for their needs.
  Catalytica, Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.), for example, used software
developed by Biosym/MSI to design a catalyst to eliminate unwanted
byproduct.
   Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Allentown, Pa.), which has used
molecular modeling to screen fluorinating reagents, is modeling catalysts
that will allow it to make polyethylene foam without freon. Where it
usually takes weeks to test a new chemical, modeling takes only minutes and
minimizes lab work, says Air Products engineering associate, Paul Mathias.

Modeling and equipment design
Equipment design is also poised to benefit from increased use of molecular
modeling. At Dow Chemical Co. (Midland, Mich.), chemists and chemical
engineers are using Gaussian's program to calculate heats of formation and
reaction of materials, to aid in reactor and heat exchanger design.
Meanwhile, Engineered Software Inc. (ESI; Lacey, Wash.) has just finished
beta testing Cranium to size piping and pumps for mixed fluids. MKS will
now offer the software to ESI's customers. ``Cranium makes process
simulation data available to plant designers and operators,'' says ESI
president Ray Hardee, ``and not just process simulation specialists.''
   In chemical product development, Union Carbide Corp.'s Thermophysical
Properties Skill Center (Charleston, W.Vs.) is using MKS's Synapse
molecular design program to measure vapor-liquid and other phase
equilibria, mainly to select solvents for liquid-liquid extraction or
azeotropic distillation. Shell Development Co. (Houston) is using Biosym's
Insight and Discover to develop new products, including a solvent tailored
to a new plastics recycling process.
   There are still some kinks to work out with molecular modeling
technology. One complaint is that the programs are time consuming. Another
is that most of today's models work best with small molecules. ``It should
take at least another three years before programs can routinely model
complex polymer processing systems,'' says Chan Chyun Chen, AspenTech's
business manager for polymer process modeling. In process simulation, data
from molecular modeling aren't quite ready for routine use, says Suphat
Watanasiri, product manager for physical properties at Aspen Technology,
Inc. (AspenTech; Cambridge, Mass.).
   But ``the pieces are starting to come together,'' says MKS president Ken
Joback, who designed both Cranium and Synapse packages. Operating companies
have been combining commercial programs with others they've developed
inhouse. DuPont researchers, for example, began their quest for the
ultimate CFC substitute by using, among others, Gaussian's program, which
applies quantum mechanical methods to electronic structure problems. To
design the right molecule, they fed into the computer ideal physical
properties and data on unwanted elements, such as chlorine.
   Once they had a basic molecular geometry, they then calculated the
molecules' vibrational frequencies and, using a Cray supercomputer and the
company's own atmospheric modeling codes, the molecules' potential
contribution to global warming. At this point, data could be fed into a
commercial process simulation program.
   Dow is also mixing and matching its own and vendors' programs, both for
its heat data project, and to build databases of energies for reactive
intermediates. So far, its efforts have achieved results that would be
difficult or impossible to do experimentally, says Nelson Rondan, technical
leader in the company's Computing and Information Technology Lab.

Inhouse and vendor software
First, Dow researchers use Biosym's Insight program to design molecules. 
They then turn to Synthia, a pogram developed inhouse and then licensed to
Biosym, to predict mechanical and other properties, such as solubility and
glass transition temperature, for polymer structures. At that point,
Gaussian's program is used for more- detailed analysis.
   Shell Development Co., meanwhile, is augmenting its use of commercial
modeling software with its own statistical thermodynamic model. Based on
equations of state, the model can calculate phase behavior or solubility.
The company is now looking for a partner to help it develop the program.
   Generally, molecular modeling programs are either derived from
experimental data, or from theoretical principles. Leading in the
development of empirically derived models is the University of Denmark's
Lyngby research group, whose Computer Aided Molecular Design package is
based on the theory of ``group contribution*'' (CE, November 1994, p. 82).
In simple terms, using this theory requires developing a database in which
molecules are divided into groups of related atoms and assigned values,
based on existing data. The data then allow properties to be predicted.
First used to predict activity coefficients, the technique has since been
extended to predict isomeric properties and solubility, and to develop
correlations between predictable properties and toxicity.
   The goal is not to present a single solution but rather to narrow the
search to a number of promising alternatives that can be evaluated further,
says Lyngby group research director, Gani. ``In some cases it's led to
solutions that companies would never have otherwise found.'' Union
Carbide, DuPont, Toyo Engineering, Simulation Sciences and Hyprotech are
among 23 companies now working with the group.
   Now, more programs are combining elements of both empirically and
theoretically derived models. Dow's Synthia, for example, uses empirical
correlation techniques, but bases predictions strictly on local polymer
structure, focusing on polymer chain segments.
   Other examples of programs using both techniques include Biosym's QSPR
(Quantitative Structure Property Relationahip) and MKS's Synapse, both of
which run on Silicon Graphics workstations. With Synapse, users specify
constraints on physical properties such as vapor pressure, flash point or
viscosity. The program then generates the molecular structures of
chemicals that satisfy those constraints. Cranium can then be used to
calculate the physical properties data needed to make a product, such as
activity coefficients, enthalpy of formation, Gibbs energy, density and
thermal conductivity.

Consortia spread the word
To develop the technology in pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical markets,
vendors and developers of modeling software are stepping up their efforts
to reach potential end users. The Lyngby Computer Aided Molecular Design
group offers companies membership in consortia for $7,500/yr.
   Biosym has also formed consortia with industries that have common
problems, a practice that Biosym/MSI is continuing. Participants typically
make a three-year commitment and invest up to $250,000. So far, consortia
are in place to study catalysis and adsorption, as well as polymer
structures, properties and behavior.
   A consortium of private pharmaceutical and chemical companies funded 
development of BatchDesign-Kit by Massachusetts Institute of Technology
professor George Stephanopoulos. Pollution prevention was a key part of the
program, which is why EPA and the National Science Foundation helped with
funding, while New Jersey Institute of Technology's (NJIT; Newark) Emission
Reduction Research Center provided some technical input.
   Clearly, molecular modeling's marketplace is expanding beyond its
traditional R&D base. Gaussian's program, for example, which costs about
$20,000 per site license, and requires a supercomputer for some
applications, is finding more CPI customers. Proponents are optimistic
about modeling's future in engineering. Says MKS's Joback, ``In less than
ten years, the [software] pieces will be in place to take a new chemical
product all the way from initial concept to a three-dimensional plant
layout.''

COMBINATORIAL CHEMISTRY WINS CONVERTS

While molecular modeling, or computational chemistry, has assumed a major
role in drug design, traditional laboratory research has been given a boost
by the advent of combinatorial chemistry or synthesis. It allows
researchers to make and test many compounds simultaneously, speeding up the
discovery process. The technology has been under development for about five
years, but only in the last few years have the CPI started to use it.
   Interest is clearly growing. Recently, for example: Parke-Davis
Pharmaceutical Research Div. of Warner-Lambert Co. (Ann Arbor, Mich.) has
spun off its Diversomer organic synthesis technology as a commercial
venture; ArQule Inc. (Medford, Mass.) has set up a joint development
venture for pharmaceuticals with Solvay Duphar B.V. (Brussels, Belgium)
using ArQule's combinatorial chemistry techniques; and a new company has
been formed to commercialize a combinatorial synthesis method for new
materials, developed at Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory in California.
   Combinatorial chemistry arose out of the need to speed up the discovery
process, notes Sheila DeWitt, an inventor of the Parke-Davis process and
now vice-president, technical development for the spin-off company,
Diversomer Technologies Inc. Computational chemistry is good for an initial
screening, she says, ``but it didn't live up to the expectation of being
able to use it for to design an active drug directly.You still have to do a
lot of syntheses and tests.''
   At ArQule, up to 4,000 compounds/d can be synthesized by the company's
Automated Molecular Assembly Plant (AMAP; diagram, above), compared with
two or three a week by a researcher using traditional methods. AMAP
consists of tiny, glass-lined reactors, ranging in size from one to 10
milliliters. They are arranged in modules up to about 1 ft2, which can be
heated or cooled as necessary. Compounds are produced from multiple
combinations of reagents by dissolving the reagents in solvents and feeding
different combinations to each minireactor.
   The solvents may be removed by various methods, such as evaporation, or
by binding the reagent on beads, then removing the solvent. ``We need to be
flexible,'' says David Boulton, senior director for automated chemical
synthesis.
   The entire process is computer-controlled, with robotic arms feeding the
reactors and removing samples for analysis. ``We run it like a plant,''
says Boulton. ``Most of the operators are chemical engineers, and we have
process and analytical chemists, mechanical engineers, and systems
engineers to handle the networking.'' He adds that the facility can also be
used for process development.
   ArQule does R&D at the facility in collaboration with partners, such as
the arrangement with Solvay. Although pharmaceuticals are the main area of
interest at present, the technology could be applied to virtually any
chemistry, says Boulton. ArQule also has an agreement with Pharmacia LKB
(Uppsala, Sweden) to develop new affinity ligands for biotechnology
applications in liquid chromatography, and is working on a process for
catalyst development.
   Diversomer Technologies is offering the Parke-Davis system as a product
line. It uses a set of parallel test tubes, filled with sand-like beads
(200-400 mesh). The beads are typically polystyrene, which is stable for
most organic molecules, says DeWitt, and they have functionalized sites to
permit molecule growth. Diversomer has a 40-PIN synthesizer, as it is
called, that can make 40 compounds simultaneously.
   Reagents, dissolved in solvents, are poured into the tubes and react
with the functionalized sites. Different combinations of reagents are fed
to each tube in a preprogrammed, automatically controlled sequence. The
beads are washed between steps and all fluids exit through the porous tube
bottoms. Finally, the products are recovered from the beads by an acid
wash.
   DeWitt points out that the system can also be used for process
development tests on a selected product. In this case, the same product
would be put in all the tubes and different reagents or solvents tested
simultaneously to determine which works best.
   Others use variations of the bead system. Affymax Inc. (Palo Alto,
Calif.), for example, starts with three pots of 10-micrometer-dia
polystyrene beads, which are given identification tags, then mixed
together. They are redivided, randomly, into three lots, each of which is
bathed in a solvent that contains a different chemical building block.
After every step, each lot is split into three more lots, thereby
multiplying the combinations.
   Lawrence Berkeley's process, in contrast with the others, is designed
for making and testing complex metal materials in parallel. Compounds are
created by sputtering individual components, in series, onto specific sites
on a substrate. The laboratory has made superconductors and
magnetoresistive materials, and is now working with phosphors,'' says Peter
Schultz, a professor of chemistry and a principal in Symyx Technologies
(Palo Alto, Calif.), which was set up to commercialize the technology.
Initially, Symyx will develop phosphors for flat panel displays, he says.

A CASE FOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AUDITS

By:
Richard Zanetti, Editor in Chief

Since the mid 1970s, companies in the chemical process industries have been
conducting compliance audits for environmental, health and safety (EH&S)
regulations. Today, a few are going beyond compliance and incorporating
management systems under their auditing umbrellas.
   Management systems audits evaluate processes that achieve management's
EH&S objectives. Rather than measuring the output of a process - usually
defined as a compliance audit - a management systems audit appraises
process strengths and weaknesses.
   Management systems audits aren't new, especially in the European
Community, which has been using British Standard 7750 for about two years
and EMAS, the Eco Audit Management Scheme, since April 1995 (CE, March, p.
49). And next year when ISO 14000 is issued, it will probably include some
criteria for management systems audits, especially on corporate policies
and procedures and senior management commitment.
   Events in Europe have spurred interest among North American CPI firms;
and so have the Canadian and U.S. Responsible Care initiatives - good
examples of management codes and standards that go beyond compliance.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency didn't address management
systems audits in its Interim Policy Statement on auditing in the April 3,
1995, (Vol. 60, No. 63) Federal Register. But the Agency says it is
considering putting some voluntary criteria into its final policy
document.
   One of the U.S. pioneers, Arco Chemical, initiated its management
systems auditing in early 1991. It formed committees to develop
requirements in such areas as training, operations, maintenance, and EH&S.
   It then measured those management systems' strengths and weaknesses.
``The key was having the people that were going to be evaluated intimately
involved in establishing the requirements,'' says James Garland, director
of manufacturing auditing. ``The audits have contributed to tremendous
improvement throughout the company.''
   But not everyone is sold on management systems audits. One problem is
that they foster resentment among managers, says Ralph Rhodes, director of
health, safety and environmental audits at AlliedSignal. ``Many managers
say, `Tell me what's wrong. I know how to fix it. '''
   Rhodes believes that management systems audits are a ``softer'' kind of
audit than compliance ones. ``You don't have the basic criteria to evaluate
the program as in a compliance audit,'' he says. ``So it's much more
difficult to do, and to convince management of its value.''
   Still, AlliedSignal will be developing a series of management systems
audits next year. The reason: The audits will be useful in finding root
causes of EH&S problems, bring greater attention to management systems'
deficiencies, and communicate across the company's large organizations.
   Management systems audits can build a valuable knowledge base as well.
Because audit teams have done so many audits and visited so many
facilities, they accumulate a wealth of information that can be used to
provide workable solutions to a wide range of company problems.
   Meanwhile, management systems audits are moving beyond traditional EH&S
topics. They are incorporating issues such as product safety, and 
including non-owned facilities.
   We urge all CPI firms to conduct management systems audits. Companies
must have good management systems in place because they set the standards
that drive performance. And good performance always drives compliance.

A NEW METHANOL-TO-OLEFINS ROUTE IS READY FOR COMMERCIAL USE

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Norsk Hydro A.S. (Oslo) and UOP Inc. (Des Plaines, Illinois) are offering
the process for license after completing tests that started last June in a
0.5-m.t./d (methanol feed) demonstration plant at Porsgrunn, Norway. The
methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process was developed as a second step in a
two-step conversion of natural gas to ethylene and propylene and can be
combined with any commercial methanol-production process, according to the
companies. For remote locations, where the cost of liquefied natural gas
ranges from 50 degrees C to $1 per million Btu, the cost of the MTO process
is comparable to that of ethane cracking and can be as low as half the cost
of naphtha cracking, says Henning Reier Nilsen, Hydro's technical director
for base chemicals.
   Methanol is converted in a fluidized-bed reactor at a pressure between 1
and 5 bars and a temperature between 350 and 500 degrees C. The process
converts 80% of the carbon to ethylene and propylene, and can be operated
to yield 50% ethylene and 30% propylene, or a 50:50 mixture. UOP developed
the zeolite-type catalyst of silicon-aluminum-phosphorus oxide.

FIXED-BED CATALYSTS SPEED UP HYDROGENATION

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Degussa AG (Frankfurt) has developed a fixed-bed process that uses new
Raney catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, where suspended
powder-catalysts or nickel-supported catalysts are traditionally used. The
new catalyst types have up to 400% higher activity than the traditional
suspended ones. Also, they can easily be recycled because they contain no
binders or carrier metal, and are significantly harder than conventional
carrier-based catalysts, an indication of longer life, says Roland
Burmeister, development manager. The new nickel-type catalyst, for example,
has a hardness in excess of 300 newtons, compared with less than 50N for
the traditional carrier-based catalyst.
   Nickel, cobalt, copper and iron-type catalysts can be produced by
Degussa in tablet form from the corresponding metal alloy, with pore sizes
up to 0.08 mL/g, which improves catalyst performance, says Burmeister. Like
conventional Raney catalysts, the tablets are then activated in a caustic
solution. In their first commercial applications, the cylinder-shaped
hydrogenation catalysts are already being used in German chemical and sugar
plants, says Burmeister. He adds that the system is economical for plants
running upwards of 10,000 m.t./yr.

REMOVE VOCS WITH A SIMPLER CARBON ADSORPTION SYSTEM . . .

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A single vessel, rather than parallel beds, is used in a new carbon
adsorption system that has been introduced by Vara International (Vero
Beach, Fla.), a division of Calgon Carbon Corp. (Pittsburgh, Pa.). Unlike
the conventional method, in which two or more carbon beds alternately
adsorb and desorb solvents and volatile organics, Vara's Revolver system
has one vessel in which the carbon is divided into four chambers, using
insulated partitions. A cam rotary valve, on a central shaft, continuously
directs the flow of two streams: the solvent-laden inlet air (SLA), which
is introduced by an inlet blower; and regenerant air or steam.
   When a chamber is being regenerated, a pipe that swivels on the shaft
seals off that chamber against SLA, while the valve directs the regenerant
stream to the chamber. Vara says the single-valve assembly, instead of
multiple valves and controls, cuts the installed cost by 50%, compared with
a conventional, dual-fixed-bed system of similar volume.

 . . . OR WITH AN ENERGY-EFFICIENT SORBENT-CATALYST BED

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including chlorinated species, are
adsorbed and destroyed on a single sorbent-catalyst bed that is being
offered for license by the University of Akron (Ohio). Because of the
method's simplicity and energy efficiency, the capital and operating costs
are expected to be only 60% as much as conventional systems that use carbon
adsorption, steam-stripping and thermal destruction, says the inventor,
Howard Greene, a professor of chemical engineering.
   The key element is that the sorbent also serves as a catalyst for
oxidizing the pollutants. The university uses metal-exchanged or
metal-impregnated zeolite pellets, packed in a column. Adsorption is done
at ambient temperature by passing a VOC-laden stream through the bottom of
the column.
   Desorption and catalytic destruction are achieved by electrically
heating the top of the column to the oxidation temperature of 300-400
degrees C, then sequentially heating lower sections. During desorption, the
stream continues to enter the column -- unlike activated carbon systems,
which have parallel beds for adsorption and desorption. In tests, says
Greene, the process has destroyed 99.99% of VOCs.

ENICHEM'S CATALYST BOOSTS CUMENE THROUGHPUT

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A new cumene process, developed by Enichem S.p.A. (Milan), will be
commercialized in March at Enichem's Porto Torres site, where it will
increase the capacity of existing units by 30-40%, to 50,000-60,000
m.t./yr. This will reduce production costs by 20-30%, says Francesco
Pignataro, phenol technology manager. Investment costs for a grassroots
facility are also expected to be lower, he says.
   Cumene, a raw material for making phenol, is produced by reacting
benzene with propylene. Enichem will achieve the increased capacity by
substituting a new beta-zeolite catalyst, which also avoids the toxic waste
generated by the conventional phosphoric acid catalyst. The reaction
conditions, in a fixed-bed adiabatic reactor. are similar to those of the
phosphoric acid route, which operates at 700 kP, except that the
temperature is ``considerably lower'' than the conventional 250 degrees C,
says Pignataro.
    However, the big difference is that the required benzene:propylene
ratio is only 4:1, compared with 7:1-8:1 for the conventional process,
hence the capacity increase (the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1). The total
yield and selectivity are over 99%, says Pignataro.

MICROWAVES CUT FINE CHEMICAL DRYING TIMES BY UP TO 95%

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

By combining a microwave source with a novel Nutsche filter design, the
Belgian company ProCept (Zelzate) claims that it has not only cut the
drying times for pharmaceutical and fine chemical powders by 80-95%, buthas
also eliminated the need for costly supplementary drying with heated
nitrogen. The capital cost is about 40% higher than that of a standard
Nutsche filter with similar peripherals, but this is more than offset by
the advantages, says ProCept.
   Developed as part of the European Union-sponsored Craft program, the
process has been piloted at Solvay's Weesp, Netherlands, plant to dry a 28%
solids slurry of fluvoxamine. It cut the time to achieve a 99.9%-dry powder
from 5 h with a conventional filter dryer, to less than 1 h, says ProCept.
   As with a conventional Nutsche filter, the slurry is charged to the
batch vessel and dewatered to about 20% humidity by the unit's rotating
mixer. A 30- to 200-millibar vacuum is then applied to remove more
moisture. Depending on the need, a single 2.4-GHz microwave source of 6 or
12 kW supplements the vacuum drying. The method is now limited to polar
solvents, but ProCept plans to extend it to non-polar solvents, which do
not absorb microwaves.

A QUICK WAY TO ASSESS HYDROCARBON CONTAMINATION OF SOIL IN THE FIELD . . .

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A field-testing method which measures hydrocarbon contamination in soil in
less than 30 minutes has been developed by Shell Research Ltd.
(Sittingbourne, England). Present practice requires soil samples to be sent
to a laboratory for spectroscopic or chromatographic analysis, which takes
several days and costs 30-50 British Pounds ($47-$78) per sample, notes
development engineer Gordon Lethbridge. The field test requires no
experienced operator and costs 5-10 British Pounds ($8-$16) per sample. It
also reduces the number of samples needed for confirmation.
   Contaminants are extracted from the soil by a proprietary organic
solvent, which also reacts with the aromatic hydrocarbon residues to form a
colored complex. The concentration of the complex is measured by a portable
colorimeter operating at 420 nm. The device has been tested in all types of
soil, including sand, clay and peat, and has a sensitivity of 50 mg/kg of
soil for diesel or gasoline fuel, according to Lethbridge. Shell is
currently negotiating with an undisclosed company to commercialize the
method.

 . . . AND A CHEAP METHOD TO REMOVE THEM

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A mobile processing plant, developed by Umwelttechnologie Terra GmbH
(Treffurt, Germany) is designed to remove hydrocarbons (HCs) and aromatics
from soil or sewage sludge. Compared with incineration processes, which
destroy HCs and fuse and sterilize the soil, the vacuum process operates at
low temperature and recovers the HCs for possible reuse. Treated soil can
be reused for agriculture.
   Contaminated soil is conveyed into an ``okotruck'' (ecotruck).
Hydrocarbons (HCs) are evaporated at 50-60 degrees C under a vacuum of 1-8
millibar, then the HC-laden exhaust is dedusted and condensed at -10 to +5
degrees C. Tests show a reduction of hydrocarbons from 6,300 mg/kg to 14
mg/kg, and BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) from 300 mg/kg to 0.36 mg/kg,
according to Terra. Up to 30 1-m.t./h units will be built within the next
20 months for use on the contaminated sands of Kuwait, as a result of
successful pilot trials with a 1-m.t./h unit. Treatment costs for a
1-m.t./h unit are about DM 35/m.t. ($23), compared with DM 80/m.t. ($54)
for alternative technologies, says Terra. Units up to 17 m.t./h can be
built.

ULTRASONIC `SALAMANDER' DETECTS CRACKS IN PIPELINES

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A battery-operated instrumentation package that checks for cracks as it is
borne along by the fluid inside a pipe, has been developed by Pipetronix
GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany), Fraunhofer-Institut fur zerstorunsfreie
Prufverfahren (IzfP; Saarbruchen), and the
Fraunhofer-Technologie-Entwicklungs-Gruppe (Stuttgart). Until now, cracks
could be found only by pressurizing a pipe with water, says IzfP's Gerd
Dobmann, while ultrasonic gages could only measure wall thickness
reductions caused by corrosion.
   The RiBprufmolch (literally, crack-inspecting salamander), uses 896
ultrasonic transducers, which emit ultrasonic waves at a frequency of 2-4
MHz. Echoes from cracks as small as about 0.5 mm are registered and stored
in a computer, says Dobmann. The unit fills most of a pipe's diameter and
has plastic seal rings to maintain its position in the pipe. Up to 100
kilometers can be covered per inspection before the unit's memory becomes
full or the battery needs recharging. For a crude-oil pipeline, a typical
speed is about 1 m/s.

CATALYST GIVES A CALORIE BOOST TO TOWN GAS

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A catalyst developed by NEC Corp. (Tokyo) increases the calorific content
of town gas, derived from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), while
simultaneously removing the entire poisonous carbon monoxide component. In
Japan, LPG is normally converted to a mixture of hydrogen and carbon
dioxide, using an iron-chromium or copper-zinc catalyst. The mixture
contains 2% CO impurity. As the calorific content of this gas is low --
about 2,600 kcal/cubic meters -- butane is added to increase the energy to
5,000 kcal/cubic meters before supplying it to households.
   Instead of adding butane, NEC uses a palladium-rhodium-alumina catalyst
to convert the H subscript 2-CO subscript 2-CO gas mixture to methane and
water at 340 degrees C and 1 atm, at the same time converting all the CO to
methane. The methane yield is 100% and the calorific content of the gas is
10,500 kcal/cubic meters. All the H subscript 2 is converted, but not all
the CO subscript 2, because for every mole of CO subscript 2 there are only
three moles of H subscript 2 (four are needed for complete conversion).
   NEC says the additional cost for supplying gas to 100,000 households
equates to only 93/household per year (U.S.90 cents). NEC plans to
commercialize the process, in conjunction with gas companies, but this is
not expected for at least two to three years.

THIS SORBENT CARES ONLY FOR OXYGEN

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

An adsorbent that reversibly binds twice as much oxygen from air as
materials now used commercially in non-cryogenic air separation, has been
developed by Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (Allentown, Pa.). It also
employs chemical discrimination, adsorbing only O subscript 2, the company
says.
   The new material, a lithium pentacyanocobaltate -- specifically, Li
subscript 3Co(CN) subscript 5.2DMF -- has adsorbed 55 cubic centermeters/g
(2.3 mmol/g) in 10 min under ambient conditions, the highest reported O
subscript 2 capacity for a solid carrier, says Guido Pez, chief scientist
for inorganic and organofluorine chemistry. For comparison, carbon
molecular sieves (CMS) have an equilibrium O2 capacity of about 1 mmol/g
and both CMS and zeolites have an equilibrium nitrogen capacity of about 1
mmol/g. Both are popular for commercial air separation via pressure swing
adsorption (PSA).
   Pentacyanocobaltate salts have long been known for their ability to bind
dioxygen, says Pez, but irreversibly. In Air Products' formulation, the
lithium changes that. The company makes the compound by adding a cobalt
chloride-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution to a lithium cyanide-DMF
solution, causing a reaction that produces single crystals. These are
heated to about 160 degrees C under nitrogen to reach the final product. In
tests, the material has lost 15% of its reactivity over 545 cycles, or
about 17 days. For commercial use it needs to have a half-life of at least
one year, so Air Products is planning further tests.

NEW COMPUTER PROGRAM ACCELERATES HEAT-TRACING DESIGN

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Heat-tracing systems can be designed in a fraction of the time needed for
standard methods through a new software program that has been introduced by
Raychem Corp. (Menlo Park, Calif.). The menu-driven program, TraceCalc
Plus, is an improvement over an earlier one marketed by Raychem.
   A key feature is that it provides the capability to design for hazardous
areas, says Chet Sandberg, Raychem's engineering computing manager. It
incorporates the electrical codes of the U.S., Canada, and the European
zone system, and automatically calculates such things as the maximum sheath
temperatures allowable under those codes. It also covers high-temperature,
mineral-insulated cable heaters (as well as self-regulating polymer cable
heaters), and it specifies control and monitoring equipment to meet design
criteria specified by the designer. A single line that includes all these
requirements can be designed in 3 min., compared with 30 min. for the old
program or up to 1 h for manual calculations, says Sandberg.

A HOT BATH CLEANS UP MIXED RADIOACTIVE WASTES

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

The first two commercial-scale plants to use a molten metal bath to treat
mixed radioactive wastes (hazardous wastes contaminated with low-level
radioactive wastes) are now being started up by Molten Metal Technology
Inc. (MMT; Waltham, Mass.). MMT's process, called Quantum-CEP, uses the
catalytic and solvent properties of a molten-iron bath at 3,000F to
dissociate complex wastes to their original elements.
   One plant, operated by MMT for Westinghouse Electric subsidiary
Scientific Ecology Group, Inc. (Oak Ridge, Tenn.), is designed to treat
3,000 tons/yr of ion exchange resins contaminated by low-level radioactive
elements. The other, also at Oak Ridge, will be operated by a limited
partnership between MMT and Lockheed Martin Corp. It will process up to10
million lb/yr of mixed radioactive wastes from government and industry
sources.
   MMT notes that wastes partition into different phases when they 
dissociate, depending on their composition. This allows non-radioactive
materials to be recovered, some as useful products. In the case of
radioactive elements, those that are volatilized and go into the gas phase
may be recovered for disposal. Others, such as uranium, are concentrated
into a stable, glassy material.

PHILLIPS PLANS TO COMMERCIALIZE A NEW 1-HEXENE PROCESS

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

An ethylene-based process for making 1-hexene that produces about 95% of
the desired product, instead of a range of olefins, will be commercialized
by Phillips Petroleum Co. (Bartlesville, Okla.). 1-hexene is a comonomer
used for making high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density
polyethylene (LLDPE). Phillips, the largest single U.S. producer of HDPE,
is piloting the process in a 90-m.t./yr plant and is currently pondering
whether to commercialize it alone or through a joint venture, says Jeffrey
Burkinshaw, director of business planning for Phillips' Chemicals Group.
   The common route to 1-hexene is the oligomerization of ethylene. There
are several variations, using different catalysts, says Burkinshaw, but
they all yield only 10-15% 1-hexene, along with a slate of products ranging
up to C subscript 30 s. Phillips' process uses a much more selective
chrome-based catalyst. The exothermic reaction is done at 80 degrees C and
about 550 psig, using cyclohexane as a diluent.

A `CLEAN' CATALYST FOR ALKYLATION

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A superacid alkylation catalyst that is non-hazardous, in contrast with the
environmentally challenging hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids currently used,
has been developed by Hydrocarbon Technologies Inc. (HTI), a
research-and-development company located in Lawrenceville, N.J. The
catalyst can be retrofitted into existing plants that use HF or H subscript
2SO subscript 4, says Vivek Pradhan, a senior research scientist. He adds
that while the catalyst's expected cost of close to 50c/lb may be slightly
higher than those of current products, the net cost will probably be lower
because it will avoid the problems of storing and handling large volumes of
liquid acids.
   HTI's catalyst is a Bronsted-acid-treated transition metal oxide that is
stable up to 650 degrees C and has shown no noticeable deactivation after
72 h, which is when most catalyst degradation occurs, says Pradhan. In
tests with a laboratory-scale, continuous-flow unit, it has converted more
than 80% of a C subscript 3-C subscript 4 olefin-isobutane feed into C
subscript 5-C subscript 9 multi-branched paraffins, with over 95%
selectivity, he says. The reaction takes place at ambient pressure and less
than 170 degrees C. HTI is seeking partners to build a pilot plant.

A RECYCLING PROCESS FOR SPENT ALUMINUM POTLINER

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Portland Aluminium Co. (Portland, Victoria, Australia), will build a
12,000-m.t./yr plant to recycle spent potliner from its smelter, using a
process developed by Ausmelt Ltd. (Dandenong, Victoria) in cooperation with
Portland. Spent potliner (SPL), from the electrolytic cells or ``pots'' in
which aluminum is produced, is a hazardous material that can no longer be
landfilled. It is mostly carbon, but is contaminated with up to 15% each of
fluorine and sodium and up to 0.5% cyanide. Various methods have been
devised to deal with it (CE, May 1994, pp 44-52).
   In Ausmelt's process, SPL and flux are smelted at 1,100-1,200 dergees C,
while oxygen is blown into the melt through a submerged lance to fuel the
process. O subscript 2 is used, rather than air, to increase the
concentration of hydrogen fluoride in the offgas. This makes it easier to
treat the HF, points out Peter King, executive director of Ausmelt. Some
fluoride combines with the sodium, and sodium fluoride is filtered from the
baghouse and returned to the furnace. Cyanide is destroyed and the carbon
is burned, leaving an inert slag. Everything left can be recycled, says
King. Ausmelt is reviewing options for the slag, including roadfill, and is
developing a process to convert the HF to aluminum fluoride, used as a
smelter additive.

PULSE COMBUSTOR HELPS TO GASIFY BLACK LIQUOR

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

A steam-reforming process for gasifying black liquor in pulp and paper
plants and recovering byproducts will be commercialized by ThermoChem Inc.
(Columbia, Md.) and Stone & Webster Engineering Corp. (Boston, Mass.),
following a successful demonstration at the New Bern, N.C., plant of
Weyerhaeuser Co. (Tacoma, Wash.). Currently, black liquor is burned in
chemical-recovery boilers, which capture sodium carbonate and sodium
sulfide for reuse in the mill. However, the boilers' recovery efficiency is
poor and they emit sulfur compounds, says Gary Voelker, ThermoChem's chief
operating officer.
   In ThermoChem's process, black liquor (70 wt.% solids) is steam-reformed
at 1,050-1,150F in a fluidized bed that is indirectly heated by the exhaust
tubes of a pulse combustor. Pulse combustors burn fuel rapidly, producing
pulses that resonate along an exhaust tube. The fluidized bed in the
2.5-ton/h demonstration plant has three combustors, each with 72 tubes that
resonate at 60 Hz. This improves heat transfer into the bed, says Voelker.
   The gasifier produces a 300-400-Btu/scf, hydrogen-rich gas for plant
fuel and for the pulse combustor. Sodium sulfate in the liquor is converted
to hydrogen sulfide and sodium carbonate. A solution of the latter is used
to scrub H subscript 2S from the product gas, regenerating green liquor for
use in the mill.

THE GROWTH RATE IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING GRADUATIONS ACCELERATES

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

On the heels of a 12% increase in the size of the U.S. graduating class in
1994, the 1995 figure was up 16%, to 6,153. The numbers come from an annual
report on degrees awarded, published by the Engineering Workforce
Commission (Washington, D.C.). The increase contrasts starkly with the
total number of all types of engineering graduates, which has remained flat
for the past two years. For 1995, that figure was 64,749, virtually
unchanged from the year before.
   ``These trends are very similar to what was reported last year,'' says
Richard Ellis, research director of EWC's parent, the American Assn. of
Engineering Societies. ``Over the years, chemical engineering has tended to
show a wavelike pattern of peaks and troughs'' in enrollments, and the
numbers reflect an upward swing that began in 1991. He attributes the
popularity to high starting salaries -- just under $40,000, according to
the National Assn. of Colleges and Employers (Bethlehem, Pa.), the highest
of any baccalaureate graduates currently.
   The number of M.S.Ch.E. degrees rose 5.2%, to 1,214. Doctorate Ch.E.
degrees were 636, down 9% from the year before.

CHLORINE RECOVERY PROCESS MAY SAVE WASTE AND MONEY

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Technology to recover chlorine from waste hydrogen chloride that has been
piloted at Carburos Metlicos S.A. (Barcelona, Spain), an affiliate of Air
Products and Chemicals Inc. (Allentown, Pa.), will be further developed by
a consortium of major chemical companies headed by Air Products. It could
save chemical companies millions of dollars, as 25-33% of chlorine
production ends up as waste HCl from chemicals production (CE, June 1992,
p. 21).
   Developed by Ronald Minet, an adjunct professor of chemical engineering
at the University of Southern California (Los Angeles), the process reacts
HCl over a copper oxide catalyst at 5-10 psig and about 200 degrees C,
forming copper chloride and water vapor. The CuCl subscript 2 is reacted
with air or oxygen at 5-10 psig and 360 degrees C, releasing the chlorine
and regenerating the catalyst. The consortium plans further testing in
Spain, followed by a technology demonstration if an engineering evaluation
proves favorable.

COAL REPLACES COKE IN IRONMAKING PROJECT

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Full-scale tests of a technology that could reduce significantly the volume
of pollutants produced by the iron and steel industry have begun in
Chesterton, Ind., where Bethlehem Steel Corp. (Bethlehem, Pa.) has
partially substituted coal for coke in two blast furnaces. In ironmaking,
about 1,000 lb of coke is used per ton of metal, but because cokemaking
produces a lot of air pollutants the industry is seeking ways to avoid its
use (CE, Mar. 1995, pp 37-41).
    Coke is used as the reductant because it has more carbon than coal,
but oil or natural gas are injected as fuel. In the tests, coal is
replacing those more-costly fuels, but because it helps with reduction it
also offsets coke use, notes Douglas Jewell, project manager for the U.S.
Dept. of Energy in Morgantown, W.Va., which is supporting the tests. Also,
the coal is being injected in granular form, saving 50% in grinding costs.
The technology for handling granular coal was developed by British Steel
Corp., says Jewell, but so far has been used at less than half the scale of
the Bethlehem tests. Bethlehem is injecting 225 lb of coal per ton of hot
metal in two 7,000-net tons/d blast furnaces, and may increase that to as
much as 400 lb/ton during the 32-month tests.

EPA INCREASES PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMITTING

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

Companies planning to start up hazardous-waste facilities will have to be
more diligent about informing the public in future. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA; Washington, D.C.) has issued a final rule that
requires a prospective operator of such a facility to hold a public hearing
in the community before submitting a permit application under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The meeting must be advertised in
local media and other outlets to assure maximum public participation in the
process.
   The rule, says EPA, will give the permitting agency ``the authority to
require a facility owner or operator to set up an information repository at
any time during the permitting process or the permit life.'' It will also
require the operator of a combustion facility to notify the public prior to
a trial burn.

By:
EDITED BY GERALD PARKINSON

The state environmental plan, designed to bring New Jersey into compliance
with national air quality standards by 2007, has been approved by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. Currently, the state is a non-attainment
area for emissions of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone.
   The plan divides the state into several regions, ranked by their

HUNTSMAN POLYPROPYLENE CORPORATION RECEIVES FACILITY WIDE PERMIT

By:
Peter Silverberg

On December 14, Huntsman Polypropylene Corp.'s 32-year-old facility in
Woodbury, N.J., became the third plant in New Jersey to receive a
``facility wide'' permit from the state's Department of Environmental
Protection (N.J.D.E.P.). The new permit, the first of its kind in the U.S.,
is designed to streamline and make pollution prevention an integral part of
the plant permitting process.
   Now being evaluated by New Jersey, the program focuses on the total
amount of pollutants generated by a facility, using a holistic approach. A
number of environmental agencies throughout the U.S. and Canada are
considering the new permitting approach. ``It is quickly becoming a
national model for regulatory reform,'' says N.J.D.E.P.'s assistant
commissioner, Catherine Cowan.
   A facility wide permit (FWP) is a single permit issued by N.J.D.E.P. to
the owner or operator of a priority* industrial facility, incorporating
permits, certificates, registrations and other approvals. The draft permit
replaces all existing facility permits and can be renewed after five
years.
   Huntsman's FWP covers over 200 individual sources of air emissions,
discharges of storm water through four permitted outfalls, and the storage
and management of hazardous waste in three tanks. For Huntsman, the single
permit will replace 80 different permits for individual process units, and
reduce 10 thick binders' worth of paperwork into a 1.5-in packet.
   More importantly, the process evaluation that Huntsman went through to
apply for the permit has resulted in the elimination of 8.5 million lb of
emissions per year. It will also remove the need for titanium
tetrachloride, isopropyl alcohol, hydrogen chloride, diethyl aluminum
chloride, cyclohexane, triethylamine, and isopentane.
   The critical first step in the permitting process is running a complete
materials account and chemicals inventory. Emissions from every process
line in the plant must be measured, and the results tabulated, either in
pounds per hour, or tons per year.
   Taking one inventory for the entire plant, instead of individual
accounts for separate process units, gets operators in touch with what is
actually going on. ``In many plants, data are old, and no one knows exactly
what is flowing in every pipe,'' explains Jeanne Herb, director of the
N.J.D.E.P.'s Office of Pollution Prevention.
   The next step is to design process modifications, and tabulate the new
emissions levels that will result from those changes. Numbers of prime
interest are pounds of waste before treatment and pounds of waste per pound
of product, says Brian O'Reilly, a chemical engineer with N.J.D.E.P.'s
Office of Pollution Prevention.
   Plant operators can then calculate reduction levels for five years. At
this point, they submit their first application to the N.J.D.E.P. for
review. The Environmental Protection office then makes recommendations,
the plant operators alter their permits, resubmit it, and the process
continues.
   Designed to replace the old adversarial interaction between plant
operators and enforcement officers, the new permit fosters open
communication. It is just this kind of two-way feedback that has made the
program a success so far, says N.J.D.E.P.'s Herb. ``Top down commitment is
required,'' she says, and Huntsman's modernization team leader Frank Gorski
worked closely with N.J.D.E.P.'s O'Reilly to get the process moving.
   The consulting firm, Environmental Resources Management Group (Ewing,
N.J.), also helped, by organizing data from existing environmental permits
into the new format, completing an inventory of air emissions that had
never been inventoried before, evaluating reasonable available control
technology for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the plant's wastewater
treatment unit, and monitoring and reporting on decreasing air emissions at
the unit. For Huntsman, getting final approval took two years. It also
resulted in a plan for significant improvements to the 325-million-lb/yr
facility, for $25 million.
   The biggest change will involve altering the polymerization process by
using a new, high-activity catalyst. According to Huntsman staff engineer
Charles Augustine, the new catalyst harmlessly disperses itself into the
product as it deactivates, so there is no disposal problem. It is also ten
times as active as the old catalyst, which had required a separate disposal
and polymer cleaning unit. In addition, the modernization process
eliminates the need for 107 out of 350 pieces of plant equipment.
   New Jersey Governor Christie Whitman and N.J.D.E.P. Commissioner, Bob
Shinn, who presented the permit to company vice-chairman, John Huntsman
Jr., and president, Ronald Rasband, enthusiastically support the new
permitting approach. ``It will save New Jersey jobs,'' Whitman said.
   So far, Huntsman is the third company in New Jersey to receive this type
of permit. The first was Schering-Plough in Kenilworth, which receive an
FWP in December, 1994. The second, Frigidaire Corp. in Edison, also
received an FWP last month. Next month, Jim Kiel, manager of environmental
affairs for The Geon Co. (Pedricktown), says his company expects to receive
an FWP for an expansion of its polyvinyl chloride resin and compound
plant.
   In March, N.J.D.E.P. will issue a report to the State Legislature
recommending that the program be made permanent. For Huntsman, the permit
helped make the difference between having to shut down the nation's oldest
polypropylene unit, and being able to keep it running efficiently. ``We're
celebrating the lack of bureaucracy in New Jersey,'' said Huntsman
president Rasband.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS WRAP UP THE BUSINESS YEAR

The mergers and acquisitions that marked last year continued in December,
which saw the launching of Fluor Daniel/GTI, a merger between Groundwater
Technology (Norwood, Mass.) and the California-based engineering and
construction firm (p. 37). Late last month, the industrial gas producer,
Praxair, Inc. (Danbury, Conn.) extended its tender bid for CBI Industries
until January 16, and raised its offer from $32 to $33/share.
   Last month's mergers and purchases included:
-- Honeywell, Inc.'s (Minneapolis) acquisition of Leeds & Northrup
measurement and control and sensor businesses from General Signal Corp. In
November, the company had acquired Control Systems Consultants, Inc.
(Ashland, Ky.).

INDIA ATTRACTS THE WORLD'S ENVIRONMENTAL COMPANIES

By:
R. Rajagopal

India is emerging as a major market for environmental technologies, as
more environmental equipment and services companies from the U.S. and
Canada explore new opportunities opened up by ongoing reform and tighter
environmental controls. German companies are also offering technology
packages meeting European Union standards, according to Hartmut Krebs,
deputy minister of North Rhine Westphalia's Ministry of Economics,
Transport and Technology Division.
   According to a recent report by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce (Washington,
D.C.), India is soon to become a major market for U.S.
environmental-service and equipment-manufacturing companies, with annual
demand expected to grow by 25%/yr through the end of the decade.
Technologies tailored to the energy and transportation sectors, solid waste
management and recycling will be India's main areas of interest.
   For U.S. firms, composting, pelletization, waste-to-energy conversion,
and water treatment will all be target areas. As of last month, when U.S.
and Canadian environmental trade delegations visited India, nearly 300 U.S.
companies were seeking joint ventures and collaborations, as well as
licensing agreements, with Indian companies, says one delegation member,
Jay Novak, Commissioner of Minnesota's Dept. of Trade and Economic
Development.
   In addition, roughly 40 Canadian environmental equipment suppliers have
shown interest in collaborating with the Indian companies, according to
international consultant, Richard Denham. Among the most active are
Anderson Operations, Inc. and RV Anderson Associ-ates, Ltd. (Ottawa), and
the Ontario National Trade Corp. Effluent and sewage treatment will be an
area of focus for Ontario International Trade, says the company's assistant
director, Murray Jans. In one project, the Canadian firm will collaborate
with PHE Consultants (Bombay) on a range of water-pollution-control
options.
    Ontario International will also execute a six-year-old, $3-million
contract with the Bombay Municipal Development Corp., funded by the World
Bank. Anderson Operations, Inc. will provide a $500,000 (Canadian) grant
to help fund the project, according to Sanjay Devnani, business development
manager with AOI India, the Canadian Energy Corp.
   Reusing flyash is the focus of other international environmental
projects in India. Working in this area is India Ash Products, Ltd., a
consortium of the U.S. -based ReUse Technologies, a subsidiary of Cogentrix
Energy, and India's India Ash Products LLC and Birla Institute of Technical
Services. India generates 45 million m.t./yr, of which only 2.5% is reused,
according to Birla Institute vice president, D. Chatterjee. The Indian
government has already begun programs designed to replace conventional
industrial boilers with circulating fluidized bed boilers.
   Some Indian-U.S. ventures are already up and running, including the
Bangalore based Kirloskar Ltd., a joint -venture between India's Kirloskar
Group and Snyder General, Inc. of the U.S. The venture has recently signed
a collaborative agreement with Malaysia's Hiong Leong Industrial Group, to
execute turnkey environmental projects in Asean nations and the Far East.

ISO UPDATE, JANUARY 1996

ISO NEWS
Certification: a must for plastics firms? Plastics companies that don't
meet ISO 9000 quality-management standards could be more vulnerable to
product liability suits, according to Sheila Millar, general counsel for
the Plastics Industry Risk Retention Group, an insurer owned by plastics
companies. The standards could affect a company's liability exposure if
those standards become recognized as the generally accepted standard of
care as a matter of law, she says. For more information, or a copy of
Millar's brief, contact Julius Aebly at Risk Retention Management
(800)533-3097, Ext. #113.

Push from Uncle Sam - U.S. government agencies are said to be strongly
urging suppliers to comply with ISO 9000 standards, rather than U.S.
government standards of the past, such as MIL-Q-9858A. In addition, a
consortium of 13 agencies, including the Dept. of Defense, the National
Aeronautics and Space Admin., the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine
Corps, are working on a single quality standard based on ISO 9000

GETTING MORE MILEAGE FROM DISPERSANT
Understanding how solids and liquids interface at the molecular level is
key to boosting efficiency and enhancing multifunctionality

By:
DEBORAH W. HAIRSTON

Whether dispersants are used to suspend pigments in paints and coatings, to
prevent flocculation in pulp slurries, or to improve adhesion of fillers in
polymers, there is no doubt that they work. Exactly how dispersants work
and what else they can be made to do are questions that suppliers are
scrambling to answer.
   For companies that make and market dispersants, such information is
vital to the development of surfactant and polymeric dispersing agents that
are environmentally friendly, cost effective and multifunctional. The
search for clues has them investigating the molecular behavior of solids in
liquids, trying to unravel the secrets of their surface interactions.
   Several factors are driving suppliers to extract more mileage from their
products. Traditionally, formulators have relied upon their technical
know-how to make dispersants. But there is an element of art in what they
do, too. While chemists dabble with different compounds to achieve desired
results, the trial-and-error method is an imperfect one that may have
unforeseen consequences for the process, the product, or the environment.
   To optimize production and reduce contaminants, such risks have to be
minimized. Furthermore, a more thorough knowledge of dispersants would
allow formulators to eliminate the bad actors, upping purity and
performance.
   ``Previously we sold products in unit operations, but now we have to
look at the impact on the total operation,'' says Terry Say, director of
technology for paper and textile chemicals at Rhone-Poulenc Inc. (Cranbury,
N.J). ``At the very least, we want to be sure that the solution doesn't
have a detrimental effect downstream. Preferably, we would like the
dispersant to have some beneficial effect.''
   The challenge of finding those solutions is only intensified by
environmental regulations that prohibit or restrict the use of certain
chemicals in dispersants and dispersions. For example, many solvent-based
dispersions are being replaced with aqueous ones.
   This changeover is increasing demand for dispersants that can perform in
water. And existing chemicals are expected to be the primary source of any
new dispersants. ``There is a lot of synergy that we don't exploit,'' says
Say. ``We can use that information to solve customers' problems.''
   Typical of the research underway is that being done at the Polymer
Interfaces Center at Lehigh University (Bethlehem, Pa.), which is
supported by ten industrial companies. Work there is focused on three areas
-- adsorption, wetting and adhesion, and mechanical behavior.
   Currently, the center is studying pigment dispersants and thickeners to
learn exactly what the molecules are doing and how to stabilize them in a
medium, usually water, against settling and flocculation, and maintain this
stability in the dry state. ``The world has known for a long time how to do
this with solvents, but water-based materials offer new and more demanding
challenges to develop good adhesion, especially under wet conditions,''
says Andrew Mercurio, the center's associate director for knowledge
transfer.
   Novel formulations of organometallic coupling agents based on titanates
have been shown to act as dispersants and as catalysts in unfilled and
filled polymers, says Salvatore Monte, president of Kenrich Petrochemicals,
Inc. (Bayonne, N.J.). Monte cites an IBM patent for magnetic recording
disks containing an iron oxide-filled resin treated with the firm's KR 38S
pyrophosphate titanate. The coupling agent disperses and chemically bonds
the iron particles to the resin. And the agent ``catalyzes the resin to
provide strength and durability without alumina particulate
reinforcements.''
   In another case, Asahi Chemical Industry has used Kenrich products to
improve the molecular weight distribution of polyethylene. This and other
research has led Monte to speculate that titanate coupling agents can be
used in situ like metallocene catalysts.
   Industry observers are skeptical. ``Organometallics have some dual
functionality, but their application as metallocene catalysts may be
stretching it a bit far,'' says Say.

Environmentally friendly
The range of applications for dispersants is as varied as the industries in
which they are used. But across-the-board, they are being formulated to be
compatible with environmentally friendly processes.
   For example, demand for copolymer dispersants for water treatment is
growing at about 5%/yr, diminishing the popularity of homopolymers, for
which demand is now virtually flat. The trend reflects the move away from
heavy-metal corrosion inhibitors and the growing use of alternatives, such
as phosphates. ``The chemistry that worked with old programs doesn't work
now,'' says Bob Zuhl, business manager for water-treatment chemicals at BF
Goodrich Co. (Akron, Ohio).
   Last fall, BF Goodrich introduced two general-purpose dispersants for
boiler-water treatment. Good-Rite K-765 and 766 fill a gap in the company's
product line for dispersants based on sodium polymethacrylates. Free of
formaldehyde and ammonia, the products are ``greener and safer than some
comparable products,'' says Zuhl. The dispersants meet U.S. guidelines for
boiler-water additives, and are chemically acceptable as boiler-water
treatment compounds proposed for use in meat and poultry plants.
   Under pressure to recover and reuse water, chemical processors are
looking for high-performance dispersants that can work at higher cycles of
concentration, says Zuhl. The type of dispersant required for a cooling
tower will vary, depending on the source of the makeup water. The use of
recycled municipal wastewater, for example, may require a treatment
program, including dispersant, that is tailored for organic, nutrient-rich
water.
   To help pulp mills ease the bottlenecks encountered as they attempt to
close up their water systems, BetzPaper Chem Inc. (Jacksonville, Fla.)
custom-blended surfactants and dispersants. The formulation, CustomSperse
improves pulp mill washing by more than 50%, says Darin Pekarek, a product
specialist for the company. The wash aid lowers the carryover of organics,
saltcake, total dissolved solids as well as pitch.
   Efforts of paint formulators to eliminate solvents from their systems
prompted Air Products and Chemicals (Allentown, Pa.) to include
solvent-free dispersants and grind aids in its line of of Surfynol
surfactants. For example, CT-131 is a grind aid for aqueous pigment wetting
and dispersion.
   Also in the Air Products surfactant line are other dispersants that
provide multiple benefits. For example, CT-136 is recommended for grinding
and dispersion of pigments in aqueous media. But the product is also
suitable for universal-type dispersions, including glycol solvent-tint
bases for water-based or solvent-based inks and coatings. In addition, the
company makes CT-141, a low-molecular-weight dispersant for aqueous pigment
dispersions.

Multiple benefits
Similarly, Rhone-Poulenc sells a full line of dispersions, including
polymeric formulations for aqueous systems. Based on carboxyl functional
polymers in a range of molecular weights, these products are particularly
promising, says Rhone-Poulenc's Say. The company is currently looking at
different types of monomers that can be incorporated into the
low-molecular-weight polymers.
   As a major producer of paints and coatings, PPG Industries (Pittsburgh,
Pa.) can draw on its considerable inhouse resources. The firm's Mazsperse
agents are available for organic and inorganic pigments, as well as solvent
and water-based coatings. Mazsperse 85B, which is good for dispersing
carbon black, is formulated for applications where low foam is required.
   Three fluorochemical surfactants developed by the Specialty Chemicals
Div. of 3M (St. Paul, Minn.) are useful as dispersants. However, Fluorad
FC-129, 143 and 118 are applicable only for the manufacture of
fluorochemical-based polymers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), says
Leo Gehlhoff, a technical service specialist for the company. The advantage
of FC-118, a 20% active, anionic solution of ammonium perfluorooctanoate in
water, is that it can be reclaimed and recycled from the fluoropolymer
manufacturing process.
   Meanwhile, much of the new research will determine how a dispersant sits
on the surface of a polymer. Knowing this will allow producers to design
greater functionality per molecule. Says Lehigh's Mercurio: ``That will go
a long way towards improving a dispersant's efficiency and cost
structure.''

INTERCHIMIE 95

A three-week general strike in France did not help the organizers of
Interchimie, France's triennial CPI show held in Paris, Dec. 4-8. Despite
transportation difficulties -- no trains or domestic flights, disruptions
in international flight service, and a gridlocked city -- about 9,000
people attended the show. Although attendance was significantly below the
expected 30,000, there was a lot to see. The 764 exhibitors at the show
introduced a variety of new products and services. Here's a samplingf
them.

THE SECRET'S OUT: CLEAN IN PLACE THE
Well known in pharmaceutical and food plants,CIP is further taking root in
the CPI

By:
Jesse C. Stewart and Dale A. Seiberling, Seiberling Associates, Inc.
Edited by Jayadev Chowdhury

  CIP for the CPI
The CIP design techniques discussed here have been recently applied to an
industrial chemical process, and its success establishes CIP's potential
for cleaning a wide variety of equipment. The success is due to the client
taking a prudent risk to apply a technology that's new, and by integrating
CIP and process design efforts up front.
   The client wanted an integrated process and CIP system capable of
sequentially producing seven highly potent compounds with very-low
cross-contamination limits. The original cleaning objectives were:
  Control cross-contamination between products to less than 10 ppm.
Existing systems could achieve no lower than 200 ppm cross-contamination
through flushing, boil-up, water-blasting and hand-cleaning
  Achieve a changeover from one product to another in less than three
days.
  The existing plant required 14 days
  Improve safety by eliminating water blasting, vessel entry, and extensive
dismantling of equipment
  Reduce aqueous and organic waste by 80%
  Reduce labor required for changeovers

   The CIP system and overall process were designed and integrated right
from the beginning. The result is a CIP-able plant that includes the
required vent lines to an incinerator and an accompanying dry-vacuum system
for handling spills. To date, there have been 12 product turnarounds in the
plant, and the CIP results have exceeded objectives.
   Figure A shows this multi-product plant with bulk-powder handling,
reactions in glass-lined vessels, centrifuging, drying, and dust
collection. The final products are very potent (active in small
concentrations), and so the equipment is vented through primary, secondary
and final HEPA filters.
   All the piping and equipment (including three dust-collection systems)
are cleaned by a single skid-mounted CIP unit (Figure B), with line
circuits and fixed sprays for vessels, heat exchangers, screws, bins, dust
collectors, centrifuges and ducts. During cleaning, the CIP solution is
recirculated at around 300 gal/min, and sequenced through the plant via
supply and return valves controlled by a distributed process-control
system.
   The process fluid is corrosive, so most of the equipment is constructed
of Hastelloy, or glass- or polytetrafluoroethylene-lined steel. Figure C
shows how Hastelloy spray balls and supply tubes are installed in vessels,
and interfaced via a flanged joint to less-expensive PTFE-lined pipe.
   The first drum of the new material exiting the dryer is analyzed for
cross-contamination of the previous product. In the majority of cases,
there has been no detectable cross-contamination. The maximum contamination
that has been detected is 1.5 ppm.
   The CIP system's high performance is causing the company to consider
extending CIP techniques to two new products. These products are highly
sensitive to cross-contamination, but now can now be produced in the same
multi-product facility, cancelling millions of dollars in investment that
was previously planned for a new plant.


Clean In Place (CIP) is an essential production tool that's saving
companies in many chemical process industries (CPI) millions of dollars in
operating costs and investment. CIP is an automated method of cleaning
process plants, involving little or no dismantling of piping or equipment.
   In the cleaning cycle, CIP brings flushing, washing, rinsing and (often)
sanitizing solutions into continuous and close contact with all wetted
equipment surfaces to remove product ``soil.'' The cleaning process
involves both chemical and physical aspects, and generally requires
recirculation to minimize water, chemical and waste-treatment costs.
   CIP has been widely applied in dairy, brewing, food and wine processing
for more than 35 years; more recently, CIP has found acceptance in
pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other batch-processing operations.
However, other CPI sectors, including industrial chemicals, agricultural
products, petrochemicals and petroleum refining, have paid little attention
to this highly effective cleaning technique.
   The primary reasons include a lack of knowledge and understanding of
CIP-based cleaning technologies, and a reluctance to change. As a result,
these industries continue to carry out their cleaning chores using
``boilups,'' flushing, high-pressure water blasting, and manual scraping
and vacuuming.

Why CIP?
There are three primary reasons for using CIP. The first - and most
important - is that CIP is far superior to any other cleaning method. With
CIP, each cleaning program is the same as the previous one; this
repeatability, in turn, translates to reliability.
   Offspec or contaminated products, which result in lost production or
costly rework, can be eliminated using CIP. The steps or sequencing in CIP
cleaning are fully automated through programmable logic controllers (PLC),
distributed control systems (DCS), or other automated controllers. Thus,
human errors associated with manual cleaning are eliminated.
   The driving force for CIP's rapid adoption in the pharmaceutical and
biotechnology industries lies in the more-stringent validation requirements
of the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. CIP makes FDA validation and ISO
9000 accreditation easier to accomplish than is possible with other
cleaning methods, which exhibit a greater degree of variability.
   The second reason for using CIP is lower operating costs. With CIP,
labor costs are reduced because cleaning is fully automated and there is
minimal or no dismantling of equipment. The turnaround time required for
cleaning is reduced, increasing plant capacity.
   Also, water and solvents for cleaning are significantly reduced. This is
particularly important if pure (and costly) water is used for cleaning, or
if the solvent wastes have to be incinerated.
   The third reason for using CIP is safety improvement. Plant personnel no
longer have to dismantle equipment, using ladders or temporary supports.
Time-consuming and dangerous vessel entry is not required, nor are such
inherently hazardous activities as manual scraping, vacuuming and
high-pressure water blasting.
   Safety is also improved when cytotoxic products are cleaned from
facilities. CIP greatly reduces any possible exposure of personnel to such
products, compared with disassembly and manual cleaning of equipment.

CIP's basic concepts
An integral part of the earliest ``automated'' CIP installations is
permanently installed supply-and-return piping that is separate from the
facilities' process piping. For example, in dairy processes (Figure 1),
some food plants, and in portions of some pharmaceutical facilities, it is
necessary to be able to clean process and storage vessels during the
production run. A number of the vessels may contain product when the
process piping is subsequently cleaned in place.
   The 3-A Accepted Practices for Permanently Installed Sanitary Pipelines
and Cleaning Systems require that ``All connections between the solutions
circuit(s) and the product circuit(s) shall be constructed as to positively
prevent the co-mingling of product and solution during processing.'' This
regulatory requirement is generally complied with by installing dedicated
piping to convey flush, wash and rinse solutions from a central CIP
recirculation unit to all of the plant's tanks, transport tankers, and
product-piping circuits.
   Dedicated CIP supply and return piping. The supply of cleaning solutions
to the storage-tank sprays is controlled with air-operated valves and
U-bend cleaning hookup stations (floverters), thus ensuring that only one
tank is connected at a time to the cleaning system. The flow of
post-cleaning solutions from the storage tanks is generally carried out by
positioning a movable elbow between the tank's outlet valve and a permanent
CIP return header connected to a return pump.
   Tankers are cleaned with drop-in spray devices or permanently installed
sprays, supplied with a hose; tanker return flow is carried out via a hose
to a return pump. Check valves in the return system ensure the continuous
movement of flush, wash and rinse solutions from the return pumps to the
recirculating unit.
   Integrated process and CIP piping. The evolution of the above concept to
a modern, high-capacity dairy process is illustrated in Figure 2, which
includes a high-capacity high-temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurization
system with a plate heat exchanger (pasteurizer), homogenizer and
self-cleaning centrifuge (the latter is in the background and not visible
in the photo). The ``all welded'' piping to and from the remainder of the
process is cleaned from a central, automatic CIP system.
   The HTST process is cleaned with the available process pumps, valves,
controls and heat-exchange equipment that are configured and controlled to
clean at the end of the production run. The required manual connections are
facilitated by two U-bend transfer panels (center left, Figure 2). In many
``extended shelf-life'' milk plants in the U.S. and Canada, all piping,
flow-control valves, pasteurized surge tanks and fillers downstream of the
HTST process in Figure 2 are cleaned in a single high-volume circuit after
each days' processing and packaging.
   Since integrated process-and-CIP piping systems use product piping to
convey flush, wash and rinse solutions to the tanks and packaging machines,
capital and operating costs, water and chemical usage, and labor are
greatly reduced. At the same time, quality is substantially improved by
eliminating the recontamination that accompanies manual connections.
   The CIP equipment in modern dairies is installed in centrally located
CIP equipment rooms (Figure 3). The equipment for supplying the alkaline
and acid chemicals, water conditioners and sanitizing solutions are
generally located adjacent to the CIP recirculating units.
   Varied applications. Whereas CIP cleaning was initially used only for
liquid food processes, the labor savings and the high reliability and
performance of the CIP systems eventually led to the redesign of several
dry, granular processes. A generic food process for dry granular process,
shown in Figure 4, is a small-scale representation of some very successful
applications.
   Here, the entire process is designed to be CIP-able, by allowing
materials to drain to one or more collection points. Each spray shown in
Figure 4 represents a multiplicity of sprays, supplied by a common valve
from the primary CIP supply line. Flush, wash and rinse solutions are moved
progressively through the process, from top to bottom, under automatic
control.
   For instance, a major food plant was designed to permit simultaneous
internal CIP (food-product contact surfaces) and external CIP (non-food
contact surfaces, support structures, service lines, and so on), using
separate CIP recirculation units. Further, a sanitary floor was employed to
collect the CIP solutions for the external systems.
   CIP has also been applied to large and complex process systems, such as
milk and whey evaporators, and dryers. These concepts, found suitable for
the food spray dryers, were later proven equally applicable to typical meat
smokehouses (Figure 5).
   In pharmaceutical and biotechnology plants, well-engineered CIP systems
can help achieve controlled cleaning, freedom from recontamination,
improved product containment, and higher operator safety. CIP systems can
also contribute to the required degree of automation of both batch
processes and the accompanying tank-to-tank transfers. The generic process
shown in Figure 6 represents one of a multiplicity of similar tanks of
varying sizes, and shows how automatic valves can be combined with U-bend
transfer panels to satisfy the process automation, flexibility and
isolation requirements of such plants.
   These techniques are transferrable to most CPI plants, as has been
demonstrated in many liquid, slurry and solids processes in the last few
years. However, to ensure proper results, it is critical that the plant's
equipment must be designed for CIP.
   To date, most types of equipment have been cleaned successfully by CIP,
including:
-- Vessels with agitators, baffles and auxiliary equipment
-- Pumps, valves and piping, centrifuges and filters, dryers, evaporators
and heat exchangers
-- Dump stations, dust collectors and bins
-- Rotary valves and slide valves
-- Sifters, mills and blenders
-- Screw and belt conveyors
-- Distillation columns
-- Packaging machines

Design criteria
CIP is most effective when the process and CIP systems are designed and
integrated early in a project's development. Equal consideration should be
given to CIP and process design. Process equipment and piping designed to
be CIP-cleanable should meet the following minimum criteria:
All the equipment that comes into contact with cleaning solutions should be
made of corrosion-resistant and cleanable materials, such as stainless
steel, or lined with glass or polytetrafluoroethylene. Less-exotic
materials will be corroded by cleaning solutions, which normally contain
such chemicals as caustic, acid and sodium hypochlorite.
   The equipment must be designed to confine the cleaning solutions.
Typical dust-handling equipment may not be water-tight, which would allow
CIP cleaning solutions to spill onto the floor and on the outside of
equipment.
   The equipment, must be drainable with no pockets or ledges. The bottoms
of flat vessels should pitch not less than 1/4 in. per ft, from rear to
front outlet, and 1/2 in. per ft from side to center, to provide reasonable
flow across the surfaces for moving suspended solids.
   All corners - whether horizontal or vertical - should be rounded, with a
minimum radius of 1 in.
   Gaskets and seals should be crevice-free, non-absorbent, non-reactive,
non-porous, and positioned to eliminate non-cleanable crevices. Gaskets and
seals used in the dairy, food and pharmaceutical industries must be made of
FDA-approved elastomers.
   Flanges and interconnecting fittings in piping should be minimized
   Piping dead ends and branches should be employed sparingly
   All valves should be cleanable. Generally, only two types of valves are
considered CIP cleanable: air-operated, sanitary compression valves (Figure
7), and air-operated diaphragm valves.
   Depending on the cleanliness required, other types of valves, such as
butterfly, rotary, check, slide and ball valves have also been cleaned
successfully with CIP. Special CIP solution-injection ports must be
provided to clean the seal areas of several of these valves
   Mass, vortex and magnetic flowmeters are considered CIP cleanable
   Use of hoses should be minimized, and the best location for gages are in
vertical pipe runs
   All piping and ducts should be pitched 1/16 to 1/8 in. per ft to drain
ports
   A detailed list of CIP design criteria is available in References 3, 4
and 6.

Controllable factors
The most important factors influencing the effectiveness of CIP cleaning
are cleaning time; cleaning agent temperature, concentration and chemistry;
degree of turbulence of the cleaning solution (physical action); and the
characteristics (cleanability) of the surface being cleaned. These factors
have a synergistic effect on cleaning performance. The right chemistry
combined with the right concentration, temperature and time will yield a
cleaning regimen that best fits a system's needs. The variables are best
evaluated in a laboratory setting before commercial facilities are
designed.
   Selection of cleaners. CIP is greatly dependent on chemical action. As a
general rule of thumb, most residues are easily removed with a dilute (1%
or less), formulated alkaline cleaner. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are the
building blocks for most of the chemicals produced today, and these bonds
are easily broken apart in hot alkaline conditions.
   The most common and aggressive alkaline cleaner is sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), and is typically used in 0.15-0.5% concentrations for
non-heat-transfer surfaces, and at 1-5% for plate-type and tubular heat
exchangers, and other heavily soiled surfaces.
   Depending on the water quality and soil, several types of additives are
often integrated into the cleaning solution. Chelating agents are used in
systems where hard water is a problem. Sodium hypochlorite is added to
alkaline solutions at levels of 30-100 ppm, to enhance the removal of both
fat and protein soiling.
   A lightly acidified final rinse aids in removing all traces of alkaline
product from equipment surfaces, enhancing draining and drying, and
providing bacteriostatic conditions that delay the growth of organisms
found in most sources of water supply. Strong, hot acid solutions may be
applied in sequence before or after alkaline solutions to clean
heat-exchange equipment.

A typical CIP cleaning cycle
Cleaning cycles and the choice of cleaning chemicals depends on the type of
soil. While many variations exist, the following is a typical cleaning
cycle:
  1. Pre-rinse with the lowest grade of water available or with recovered
solution. The purpose of this step is to remove as much ``loose'' soil as
possible prior to the formulated alkaline wash. Pre-rinsing of most organic
fat, carbohydrate or proteinaceous soil is generally accomplished with
ambient temperature water or warm recovered solution
  2. Alkaline wash with recirculated, formulated solutions. This sequence
brings hot (typically 55-80C), chemical-laden solution into intimate
contact with all soiled surfaces. Since relatively long contact times are
required for this primary cleaning step, recirculation of the cleaning
solution is essential for economical operation
  3. Post-rinse with water, normally at ambient temperature. This step is
to rinse away most of the residual alkaline cleaner. This solution is
sometimes recovered for the pre-rinse in the next CIP cleaning program.
  4. Acid rinse, normally at ambient temperature with recirculated acid
solutions. The purpose of this step is two-fold:
   The acid rinse will neutralize and remove residual alkaline cleaner.
Alkaline cleaners form ``films'' on equipment that are not readily removed
by a simple post-rinse with water
   The acid rinse will also remove mineral deposits, left by the water used
in the chemical solution and rinses, from the cleaned surfaces
  5. Post-rinse with water or recirculated sanitizing rinse, used to apply
a bactericidal agent to all cleaned surfaces. The post-rinse is often
heated to permit fast drying of equipment. Some plants follow the
post-rinse with heated air, blown through the CIP sprays or separate supply
ports, to aid in equipment drying

The CIP circuits
In some applications, an entire process, or an easily isolated portion of a
large process, is shut down and cleaned in its entirety. Other processes
may require a vessel or transfer line to be cleaned while the remaining
process equipment is used to manufacture product. In this situation, U-bend
transfer panels (Figure 8) with interlocked proximity switches are used to
separate the cleaning solution from the product.
   Swing elbows, leak-protection valves and double block-and-bleed
(mix-proof) systems are other methods of isolating the cleaning solution
from the product or from the equipment that must be kept dry. With proper
product isolation, CIP solutions can be circulated in various types of
cleaning circuits even while product processing continues. Cleaning
circuits typically have the following characteristics:
   CIP solutions are normally pumped through process piping that is 4 in.
in diameter, or less. This is because cleaning effectiveness is enhanced by
physical action due to turbulent flow.
   Piping systems can be effectively cleaned by recirculating CIP solutions
at velocities of 5 ft/s or more in the largest-diameter piping in the CIP
circuit. The 5 ft/s is a general standard for CIP systems, but lower
velocities may be effective with increased circulating times, temperatures
or chemical concentrations.
   Line circuits may include equipment such as pumps, colloid mills, heat
exchangers, centrifuges, homogenizers and filters that are CIP-cleanable,
and so able to withstand the required flows and pressures. A typical
circuit for cleaning transfer piping connected via U-bend transfer panels
is shown in Figure 6 (bottom center)
   Vessels and other large process equipment, such as basket centrifuges,
dryers, conveyors, evaporators, pipes or ducts, and shell-and-tube heat
exchangers are generally sprayed rather than flooded, to reduce pumping
requirements. Figure 6 shows a typical circuit for a biotech process vessel
(lower right)
   The CIP solution-return system is designed to maintain a very small
puddle of product in the bottom of a vessel, to reduce the amount of
cleaning solution required, and to prevent the ``bath tub'' deposit of soil
at the liquid-air interface. Vessels can be effectively cleaned by
distributing CIP solution on the upper surfaces at flowrates of 2.0-2.5
gal/min per foot of circumference for vertical domed vessels, or at 0.2-0.3
gal/min per square foot of internal surface for horizontal and rectangular
tanks, mixers, bins, dryers, cyclones and ductwork
   In many applications, the vessel may be cleaned as part of a combination
circuit where process piping and pumps are engineered to serve the CIP
solution supply or return function, or both (the integrated process and CIP
design)

The CIP recirculating systems
The components of a CIP recirculating unit are typically skid-mounted on a
frame, to simplify the installation of the electrical wiring, and utility
and drain connections. The units typically consist of:
   A recirculation tank with supply pump, to recirculate solution to the
process piping and equipment
   A heat exchanger to heat the cleaning solution
   A programmable logic controller (PLC), instrumentation and valves, to
control sequencing, solution flowrate and temperature, and monitor
conductivity or resistivity, or both (these indicate cleaning solution
strength and rinse water purity)
   Additional auxiliary equipment, such as an eductor, automatic strainer
or water tanks. A strainer can be used to automatically discharge suspended
oversized solids to the drain. The strainer will discharge when the
pressure drop across the strainer exceeds a pre-determined value
   A chemical-feed system. Most often, chemicals are metered volumetrically
from drums to the cleaning system by diaphragm pumps mounted in a separate
cabinet. Cleaning chemicals can also be fed from bulk-storage tanks through
meters

Selecting CIP equipment
A single-use eductor-assisted (SUEA) recirculator is shown in Figure 9.
This unit has a motive pump and eductor mounted on the skid. The eductor is
capable of producing about 15 in. of vacuum, to pull returned solution back
to the recirculation tank. The eductor may act alone to return the
solution, or can operate in series with a CIP return pump near the process
vessel or other equipment being cleaned.
   The required pumping rate for supplying solutions is determined by the
size of the transfer lines and vessels to be cleaned. Again, the optimum
velocity in lines being cleaned needs to be 5 ft/s. If a single CIP
recirculation unit is applied to clean lines and tanks, the CIP
requirements for the largest tanks will generally establish the maximum
delivery rate.
   Vessels less than 5 ft in diameter require a supply of 40 gal/min; tanks
of 8 to 12 ft in diameter will require 80-90 gal/min. It is desirable to
clean as much of the equipment and piping as possible with a relatively
small variation of flow. A turndown from high to low flow of more than 50%
causes difficulty in properly sizing flow-control valves, heat exchangers
and chemical pumps.
   The CIP pump's discharge head must exceed the head loss through the
longest piping circuit, and it must supply the sprays in the largest and
most-distant tank at the required operating pressure. Since most commonly
applied sprays operate at 25-30 psig, and the approximate head loss through
sanitary tubing is in the magnitude of 5 ft per 100 ft of length, pump
discharge pressures are normally in the range of 50 to 80 psig, well within
the capability of sanitary centrifugal pumps. If the CIP delivery rate is
to be controlled by a flow valve, then the pump discharge head should be
about 1.2-1.3 times the maximum circuit loss (including spray supply
pressure for tank CIP circuits), for effective rate control with sanitary
flow-control valves.
   The recirculation tank is often as small as 60 gal. If the plant water
supply is substantially lower than the CIP pump's delivery rate, then the
CIP unit must contain one or more water tanks to supply the required water
flow. A physical break or ``double block and bleed'' valve is often used
between the water supply and the water tanks to ensure no contamination of
the water source. If the available water supplies permit the use of a
single recirculation tank and no water tanks, the water should be delivered
to the recirculation tank through a spray designed to rinse all the tank's
upper surfaces and sidewall areas.
   A shell-and-tube heat exchanger is normally part of the CIP unit. The
pre-rinse to remove most fat, carbohydrate or proteinaceous soil is carried
out with water at ambient temperature, or below 45C, to avoid ``cooking''
or setting the soil on the equipment surface.
   The cleaning solution is recirculated and heated with a shell-and-tube
heat exchanger, to temperatures between 55 and 80C. Hot-water sanitizing
may require delivery of water at 90C. Steam should be available in
sufficient capacity to heat the recirculated solution and the equipment
being cleaned to the desired temperature in 5-10 min, to keep cleaning
times reasonably low.
   Shell-and-tube heat exchangers must be insulated for safety reasons.
But, for sanitary reasons, it is desirable to avoid insulating CIP tanks,
solution lines, pumps and valves. Safety is also improved by limiting the
access of non-essential or untrained personnel to the facilities during CIP
operation.
   CIP solutions can be returned by several methods:
   A CIP solution return pump can be installed near the vessel being
cleaned. Low-speed (1,750 rpm), return pumps will provide effective return
flow to the CIP recirculation unit's tank, if the return line pitches
continuously from the tank being cleaned to the pump inlet, and if a static
head of 18-24 in. of water is available.
   The pitch permits air to escape the pump and return to the tank being
cleaned. On long return lines, or on CIP return headers, an air-relief
valve located at the pump inlet will provide improved performance. ``Self
priming,'' sanitary return pumps will more easily handle entrained air than
conventional pumps, but they are also more expensive. High-speed (3,450
rpm), return pumps have a greater tendency to become ``air bound'' than
low-speed pumps
   Gravity flow by itself will remove rinse and wash solutions from the
vessel being cleaned if the tank outlet, valve and return piping is
sufficiently large and the static head is adequate. This method generally
requires the CIP recirculation unit to be 12-16 ft below the outlet of the
vessel being cleaned. Return piping should be pitched continuously from the
vessel being cleaned to the recirculating unit
   An eductor will handle both air and water, and can be used alone or with
a return pump. If used alone, the head loss in the system must be limited
to the vacuum produced by the eductor, generally being in the magnitude of
14-15 ft of water pressure drop.
   Eductor performance may be affected by solution flashing if the
temperature is too high. Those systems that combine eductors and return
pumps (eductor-assisted CIP systems) can effectively use high-speed (3,450
rpm) high-head pumps. The eductor continuously primes the high-head pump.
The high-speed pump is usually less expensive than an equivalent low-speed
pump, and the higher discharge head permits the use of smaller diameter
return-side piping, of lesser volume
   Top pressure may be used in place of gravity or a return pump to induce
flow from a pressure-rated vessel through the return piping to the
recirculating unit. A hold-back valve may be required in the return line to
control the weight of the cleaning solution puddle being maintained in the
vessel being cleaned, and to prevent loss of top pressure by blowing the
puddle out of the vessel, except at the desired times at the end of each
major program step

Selecting spray devices
There are two basic types of sprays used for CIP: static and dynamic-head
sprays. Figure 10 illustrates three variations of the static spray
including a pumpkin-shaped ball; a tube spray with many directionally
drilled ``bubble'' spray heads; and a ``bubble'' spray. All the sprays are
removable via tri-clamp connections or slip joints for inspection and
cleaning.
   The balls are used in such equipment as vessels; the ``bubble'' sprays
are used in ductwork and equipment where the spray device must be recessed
to prevent contact with product and other special applications. The tube
sprays are used in a variety of applications, such as difficult-to-reach
areas or where the number of nozzles for mounting multiple balls is
limited.
   These sprays have found wide acceptance for permanent installations in
pharmaceutical, dairy and other industries. The static sprays have been
found to be effective and reliable cleaning devices when used in
combination with properly controlled chemical cleaning programs. The sprays
are sanitary, there are no moving parts, and spray performance is not
affected greatly by minor variations in supply pressure.
   Dynamic head sprays produce a rotating pattern and are driven either
electrically or by the solution being sprayed. The sprays are not
considered self-cleaning and sanitary because their intricate internals,
such as threaded parts, bearings and seals, are difficult to clean. Dynamic
sprays produce jet streams that help remove hardened soils; such impact is
not normally required in CIP, which is primarily chemical in nature.
Devices to detect rotation and constant supply pressure are essential for
the sprays to perform effectively.

for the actuator housings; the plug, stem seals and body gaskets are made
of Buna N, Viton, steam-resistant Viton, EPDM or butyl rubber. ``Mix

The personal computer has had a profound effect on access to information
for engineers throughout industry. Nevertheless, the information systems
needed to run a complex CPI plant such as a refinery have not changed:
operations management, maintenance, crisis management, warehouse,
engineering, laboratory, business, and scheduling, among others.
    Various control or data processing systems are currently used to manage
these data needs, but computer technology and business economics are
unifying these requirements into one, all-encompassing system -- the
industrial desktop computer. The industrial desktop is an evolving concept,
but at this stage, several components are clear:
  -- It is based on personal computers, or workstations that are compatible
with these computers
  -- It has ready access both to plant-floor data (the conventional purpose
of process control computers) as well as a variety of business applications
and telecommunications capabilities
  -- It makes use of the software conventions centered around Microsoft
Corp. (Redmond, Wash.)
   Engineers, plant managers and others want an industrial desktop because
it promises to give them ready access to vital information. This is
critical not just during emergencies (when, in fact, lives are at stake)
but also in the pell-mell competition to get and keep customers, to reduce
costs and to improve productivity.
   Many computer and automation vendors are making a concerted effort to
serve this technological need. At the same time, users themselves are
helping to shape it by the demands they put on equipment and software
developers.

Getting the best
The rationale for the version of the industrial desktop comes from three
sources. First, the lower cost and greater power of the latest PCs allows
workers to handle tasks that had required large, expensive computer systems
in the recent past.
   Business managers have been comfortable in equipping office workers with
this power for word processing, spreadsheets and communication. Plant
engineers, however, have not enjoyed the same benefits.   They have the
same basic requirements as the office workers plus plant-related needs.
   Second, current business conditions force manufacturers to make do with
a minimum staff. Whether fair or not, the reality is that companies are
succeeding in carrying out their duties with drastically reduced staffing.
The days when plant engineers ran plants, sales engineers sold products and
executives ran the business are passing; now all are involved with these
activities.
   Third, the current evolution of PC software points to the dominance of
one company, Microsoft, with its various Windows operating systems, and
with a growing collection of de facto protocols or conventions in how
programs should be structured. This system is supplanting older proprietary
or Unix-based programs in industrial applications, most notably in
distributed control systems. The longterm benefits of such a concentration
of, or reliance on, one company's products is debatable; what seems
indisputable is the efficiency and reliability of working today in the
Microsoft environment.

Borrow from office automation
There are similarities in the industrial desktop and the office desktop
infrastructure, but there are also differences. The similarities are
important because the industrial desktop is too small and too specialized
to generate its own applications and standards. We must ``borrow''
technology from the office environment or wherever it springs.
   The industrial desktop works for supervisors, planners, quality
managers, and many others -- each with unique informational needs.  The
industrial desktop provides a common window for all of them.
   There are five considerations when constructing the industrial desktop:
  -- Three-tier computing
  -- Scope and definition of industrial desktop computing
  -- Evolution of OLE (to be defined later) technology
  -- Single window operation
  -- Migration of legacy (old, obsolescent) systems

   Much has been written about three-tier computing in the business world,
but it is equally appropriate in industry. The philosophy, shown in Figure
1, is that the best way to manage large, complex operations is to separate
data (orders, process conditions, employee records) from applications
(scheduling, maintenance-management or training programs) and from the
presentation (the screen or text output).
   Figure 2 is a more realistic diagram of the tiers where there are
several applications, each with a database, each with an application layer
that presents its data and methods to the presentation layer, and parallel
application layers. The desktop has the presentation layer and usually uses
data and methods from  parts of the application layer.  The  application
layer makes data accessible and updates easy  while ensuring their
integrity.
   Several methods are used to generate the application layer. The concepts
that describe these methods are: the transaction processing monitor; stored
procedures; and objects. The transaction processing monitor performs a
two-phase routine to ensure that data, after an update, are still
consistent. The stored procedure allows users to update via a script or
program. The object approach hides the details of the actions from the
applications, and has advantages in the three-tier setup.
   To see how three-tier computing works in a plant, consider the example
of 24-h production, one of the most basic performance calculations. Say
there is a tank and a flow where the company needs consistent numbers for
production. This may seem easy, but now consider the dataset. There are
many questions and ambiguities in the computation for 24-h total:
  -- What flow correction is used?
  -- What is the proper time stamp of the manual inputs or lab data?
  -- How are missing data handled?
  -- How are small negative or positive numbers handled?
  -- How are redundant data used?

   It is clear that people could get many different answers while computing
the 24-h total, which could be misleading. Comparable calculations are
performed in business offices on spreadsheets, but much of this is
essentially unvalidated, unchecked program code handed from person to
person. This is clearly a problem in the office, but in the plant could
lead to  people or equipment in jeopardy.
   The role of three-tier computing is to address squarely the methods used
to present information in a consistent fashion. This has the very desirable
result of protecting the integrity of both the data and the methods by
having documented in only one place both the information and how it is
used. As configurations or data or methods change, the application layer
can implement the management of change at a single location.
    Objects are a formal method for implementing the three-tier
architecture. We can expose an interface that permits any application to
ask a question and get the same answer. In this example, what is needed is
a real-time data object with an exposed interface for calculating the 24-h
average.
   Other advantages of the three-tier architecture with objects include:
  -- Avoiding the ``fat clients.'' Many applications treat the PC as if it
were the only computer, so that if other workstations need the same data or
methods, those data or methods must be duplicated in another PC. A properly
networked system  smoothes out these burdens
  -- Minimizing bad information. With all data coming from a single source,
the likelihood of bad information being presented is far less and, if
errors are found, corrections are easier and need be done in only one
place
  -- Standardizing definitions of process information. Since there is only
one definition, inconsistencies are eliminated at the source

   The construction of a three-tier architecture to support the industrial
desktop is a big job. The ideal would be to have an agreement between
vendors so that applications share objects and methods. Microsoft has
launched a project called OPC (OLE for Process Control; CE, November 1995,
p. 53) that adds real-time objects to the Microsoft OLE environment. This
project could accelerate  cooperation on a standard.

Connecting  the desktop
Consider the analysis of an oleum spill that occurred a few years ago in an
urban area. The incident investigators determined that a helper, because of
absence of a sick operator, was elevated to operator and began loading the
tank car. The helper had no formal training in the loading procedures. A
vent that would have prevented the gas release was not used.
   The problem here was not the lack of training; it was that unplanned
changes (to accommodate an illness) and information for those making the
change did not match. The individual assigned the task did not have
sufficient training, and thus did not maintain the required level of
safety. The data were there, but lost somewhere in the plant, and not
readily available to the managers.
   Most companies are in this situation, relying on people's memory and
experience. But this does not work as organizations are downsized and these
people leave the scene. In order to avoid this problem, the workstations of
those scheduling or managing personnel need to have convenient access to
tasks, skills, procedures and equipment required in the facility.
   Consider Figure 3 as a possible hardware configuration for the
industrial desktop with a few of the possible servers commonly found:
  -- Local-area network (LAN) for files, printers, fax, modem, and so on
  -- Plantwide information management (PIM) system, for process information
and history
  -- Relational database (RDB), storing plant configurations and
``warehousing'' data
  -- Private branch exchange (PBX) -- a telephone network supporting voice
and some data-based communication. This may be complemented with a computer
telephony server to support unified messaging for fax, e-mail, phone mail
and others, remote access, call director, teleconferencing, wide-area
networks (WANs) and an Internet interface
  -- Workgroup (discussion groups, Web page, e-mail,  document database)

   It is worth noting here that even organizations that do not consider
themselves at the leading edge of information technology can already have
hundreds or thousands of workstations in place -- really a staggering
number. The surprising observation about applications for the industrial
desktop (Table) is that most of these are not on the office desktop. The
clear message is that to construct the industrial desktop for all the
thousands of users is not a single project. A continuous-improvement
implementation must be used.

Evolution of OLE technology
``Objects,'' which have been referred to several times in the text, are the
preferred way to work with computer programs these days (CE, July 1995, p.
86). An object combines data (such as a text or drawing) with instructions
on how to interpret them. There are many advantages of object technology
for developers, primarily in the reuse, rather than constant rewriting, of
code. There are also benefits to the users:
  -- Common user interface
  -- Single window presentation
  -- Migration of legacy systems

   OLE originally meant Object Linking and Embedding, and it was only able
to house an icon  that could be clicked on to launch an application. At
that time, the entire application that supported the object was launched in
order to use it. Later Microsoft began to develop software that allowed the
programs to be edited in place and this evolved to the OLE 2.0 - In Place
Activation. OLE was redefined to be a generic term for the technology
implemented with the Microsoft objects. The Microsoft definition of objects
is called COM (common object model) and DCOM (distributed COM).
   OLE technology is expanding at a rapid pace with announcements from
Microsoft. As the PC becomes part of bigger systems, OLE technology
provides a roadmap to more complex program designs.
   For forward-looking developers, OLE technology will give immediate
access to the 32-bit capabilities of the PC and, according to Microsoft,
the 64-bit VLIW (very long instruction word) technology coming with the P7.
(P7 is the next generation of microprocessor, and is being designed by a
joint venture between Hewlett Packard and Intel Corp. Due in 1997, it may
use a new design called Precision Architecture. VLIW and Precision
Architecture are both technologies to boost the speed of instruction
processing.)
   The  software features of a Microsoft OLE desktop that will greatly
influence its ``look and feel''   will be:
  -- ODBC (open database connect) data access
  -- Object manipulation (OLE Automation)
  -- Scripting

   ODBC is a nonproprietary standard supported by Microsoft and all major
database vendors. It is the ``calling mechanism'' for a way to interact
with databases called structured query language, or SQL.
   There are two enhancements that will make ODBC the standard tool for
constructing a three-tier system on the desktop and application servers:
JOIN and Stored Procedures. Microsoft added JOIN to ODBC to allow SQL
queries to use information from several different databases, local or
remote. If the batch data were in a business database and production data
were in a data historian (both supporting ODBC access across the network),
the PC can issue a query to do a JOIN between the two for reporting things
like ``get average quality vs. specification WHILE Grade = Grade X over the
last month.''
   The addition of Stored Procedure to ODBC will allow a user to create
custom applications. Data will be handled in a prescribed manner even
though they are in different databases.
   Object manipulation and scripting allow the interaction with the screen
to be ``programmed'' by the users (similar to spreadsheet macros). These
scripts are triggered by the so-called ``OLE automation events.'' The
industrial desktop then acts like a call center for plant personnel. If you
want to pop a window when there is a process alarm, the systems would have
to have an event created by the application software on change of state of
a variable, and then run a script (written in Visual Basic) to put the
window on the screen -- a very common function in workstations.
   Some of the companies providing software for industrial process control,
including ours, are in the process of obtaining Windows 95 certification.
In our case, the relevant products are  ProcessBook (a real-time database)
and PI System (a desktop interface). To reach this level, work began in
early 1993, with a beta version being tested by selected customers a year
later. A prototype of the OLE Automation version was ready in March 1995.
   But this is merely the beginning of the race that industrial software
developers must run in the next several years. Consider the number of
enhancements to the desktop that must yet be implemented:
  -- OLE DB--virtual data base including ODBC, JOIN, Stored Procedures
  -- OPC--process control including real time data
  -- Network OLE--distributed objects including security and license
management
  -- OLE TP--transaction processing
  -- OLE Across Platforms--a joint venture with Digital Equipment Corp. for
a Corba port of OLE (Corba is the Unix equivalent of OLE)
  -- OLE for Enterprise--a project with Texas Instruments for object
registry
  -- OLE Office--compound documents, binders, office elements
  -- WOSA--class libraries for real time access
  -- TAPI--class libraries for telephony
  -- CAD--class libraries for drafting
  -- GIS--class libraries for geographical information systems
  -- DNS--class libraries for distributed name services

 . . . and there are more every month.
   Clearly the work will be beyond the capabilities of any one company.
Those with the manpower and capital may not have the expertise and vice
versa.
   Component software is the answer to this situation. If a good
infrastructure for the industrial desktop is created, and it adheres
rigidly to the Microsoft standards in the form of the ``Designed for
Windows 95'' logo certification program, smaller companies will be able to
create OLE controls for the applications in the Table. Those controls can
be pasted into the industrial desktop using OLE Automation and OLE Visual
Basic Scripting. All this innovation should come at a relatively low price 
-- probably less than $1,000 per end user.

A window on the process
Nearly everyone using PCs today is familiar with the ``look and feel'' of a
common window environment. Each screen looks more or less the same;
commands are in the same places; and different programs use many of the
same command conventions. Even when a user completely inexperienced in a
new application opens a window, he or she can readily navigate through the
program.
   Windows (of all types, not just Microsoft's) have been a common feature
of PCs since the late 1980s. At about the same time, the engineering
workstation market (which has historically been based on the Unix operating
system) adopted the ``X Window'' protocol to provide user interfaces
comparable to those of PCs.
   PC users are familiar with having multiple windows open, running
different applications. The situation is different in the process control
field. As systems (each with different windowing standards) began to
proliferate, it became clear that operators did not want to learn many
different ways to interact with a system. Some of the design parameters for
operator consoles are that operators can only learn 1.5 - 2 different
interactive systems.
   This shows the lunacy of building special screens that are not normally
used, and  that only require actions during high-stress emergencies that
will lower both of these numbers. A better design goal is the single
window, but we have not always provided this. The evolution has been:
  -- Multiple terminals, single room (for example, the centralized control
room)
  -- Multiple windows, single box (console furniture integration)
  -- Multiple look and feel, single screen (X Window)
  -- Single look and feel, single screen (Microsoft Foundation Classes)
  -- Single look and feel, single screen, single interoperable applications
(OLE)

   The advantages of the single window are clear:
  -- Cost
  -- Training
  -- Speed of access and familiarity in emergencies
  -- Quality of applications
  -- Reduced redundancy of function
  -- Simplicity for developers, allowing them to concentrate on
applications

   To provide a single window, there must be not only a common platform,
but also a common look and feel, common support and common object
definition. This is the reason that the X Window convention has not been
satisfying to the users. To get the applications that they wanted (e.g.,
Excel) required a different terminal.
   Another weakness was the lack of a graphical user-interface standard.
Two X applications do not need to have a constant look and feel or even
permit a cut and paste between them. In some cases, such as Kanji
characters in Japan, they do not use the same character sets and cannot see
the text from another workstation even if the cut and paste were allowed.
   The Microsoft OLE Technology provides us an opportunity to build that
common look and feel -- essentially plagiarizing the consensus developed
for the office desktop.

Migration of legacy systems
In order to succeed, we must address squarely how to migrate the legacy
applications that exist today in a plant.
   With a bit of poetic license on the spelling, we have the three R's:
  -- wRap
  -- Reengineer
  -- Replace

   With the approach proposed in PlantSuite*, this can be done as part of
an evolutionary improvement cycle and not in one, disruptive project. To
understand how to replace legacy systems, we have to know why they are
legacy systems in the first place. It could be one or more of the
following:
  -- Old technology that is hard to maintain
  -- Systems containing much information that cannot be shared
  -- Systems having older, one- or two-tier design instead of three-tier

   It may be surprising to management, but many new systems fit these
criteria -- usually as a result of the wrong focus as the old organization
tries to perpetuate itself. The key to replacing legacy systems is to keep
a focused, long-term vision to guide the short-term implementation with a
system flexible enough to accommodate the change. Today, we have an
environment that would seem  to remain constant for the next five years:
Microsoft OLE technology.
   Most legacy systems of any age contain vital information used for
running the plant, so simple replacement by new systems is not an option.
In a modern system, objects are chosen (e.g., people, positions,
procedures) and the methods they need to support are defined (for example:
Given a person, for which tasks is he or she current?).
   If these data are in a legacy system, then an interface must be written
to extract them. The key is to properly expose (or ``wrap'') the data and
methods. For example once information is obtained using OLE DB for a SQL
access, SQL JOIN or Stored Procedure, it can be exposed to the desktop
using standard software.
   Reengineering of the systems so that the methods are exposed to the
desktop is an example of three-tier design. The data buried in legacy
systems can be accessed using tools to extract the methods and data to a
separate layer (another type of wrap) and then exposed to the desktop. As
each application is completed, the number of objects should stabilize and
it will become clear what are needed to support the business processes.
   There are four challenges to create this design:
  -- The system must be able to see information in a consistent manner from
any data source
  -- It must be able to perform a JOIN between data regardless of physical
location
  -- The system must be able to execute stored procedures that may use
information from many different data sources
  -- Once the result is obtained, it must be presented to the industrial
desktop in a standard manner

   This is almost precisely the description of the ODBC service in the OLE
DB class libraries that are part of the Microsoft OLE Technology.
   Once the wrap and reengineer are complete, replacement becomes easier.
If the redesigned system is well supported, it will, by continuous
improvement, evolve into the system required by the organization. Support
is a key driving force for this change. If the only support comes from
people who simply maintain the manuals or are interrupted at their normal
job, then there is no support. A dedicated support team is necessary.
   The industrial desktop is real and is critical to business. It is
integral to the movement of information, and generation and acceleration of
an innovative environment for businesses. This can be a strategic advantage
for companies that support their plant personnel with the same automation
tools as the office workers.

PROCESS CONTROL IMPROVEMENT VIA DISCOVERY
A careful assessment of control requirements brings longer-lasting
benefits

By:
Joel M. Vardy, The Foxboro Company
Edited by Nicholas Basta


Traditionally, process control has been viewed as an important subcategory
within production management. Process lines need to be controlled to move
raw materials in and finished goods out, and the control system has evolved
to carry out this critical function reliably.
   Today, however, the rapid advances in information technology are making
process control systems even more important to the overall performance of a
manufacturer. Better software and more-powerful yet less-expensive
hardware allow managers to use the control system as a competitive tool --
a source of data, a means to cut costs, and a method to reduce production
cycles and meet customer timetables.
   Wise application of this tool will require all the techniques taught in
engineering school, along with business methods borrowed from other
disciplines. Moreover, plant managers are finding that as control
strategies grow more comprehensive, they are working more closely with
other parts of the business -- sales and marketing executives, safety and
environmental managers, and corporate management.

Another way
This situation makes the design and selection of control technology a more
complex issue than simply comparing cost, capability and reliability. A
different method of evaluating these factors is proposed -- the Discovery
Process.
    To make it all clear, the hypothetical example of Acme Chemical Co.,
and the events that transpired at it over a year-long period, will be
examined. Acme's story, while containing bits and pieces of actual events,
is fictitious.
   Acme has been a good, middle-of-the-road manufacturer, with several
plants spread across the U.S. midwest and south, as well as newer plants in
Europe and Asia. One of the plants, on the Gulf coast, is called
LargeAcres.
   Headquarters has been downsizing to adapt to competitive realities and
realign along business units that manage the global product lines.
LargeAcres has until recently avoided the downsizing due to the strength of
its product lines. Unfortunately, the market has shifted in the last 3
years and the plant is already operating with less than 85% of its original
workforce. Important workers at LargeAcres are:
  -- Harry, the area manager for both Unit 4 (producing Monomer A) and -- a
more recent consolidation -- Unit 5 (producing Polymer B -- Figure 1). The
combined responsibility was a recent change in staff structure
  -- The process engineer for Unit 4, Charlie, has been ill lately, yet is
quite knowledgeable about the original operation. He was nearing retirement
and his health problems were sometimes interfering with his duties though
the plant was now running pretty lean with few options for back-filling his
position. Plant Management was weighing its options in light of the
situation.
  -- Jim, the plant manager, has generally been pleased with how well his
units had been performing, in spite of attrition due to staff cutbacks. Jim
was also mindful of an upcoming announcement that LargeAcres had to reduce
its costs by 10% or risk shutting down the Polymer Unit, which in turn
would put more pressure on the Monomer Unit to find new markets or face
additional cost pressure. Jim was in daily communication with corporate
planners.
  -- Also important in the ongoing functions of Jim's plant are Jane, the
R&D manager, and Kathy, the environmental, safety and health (ESH)
administrator assigned to his unit. Jane had been growing increasingly
worried about the lack of consistency between the laboratory QC programs
and actual data from production units. Kathy had just been brought in from
corporate, where she wrote some of the company's new safety policies.
   During a Monday staff meeting, after the production numbers were
reviewed, Jim requested that Harry and other area managers begin a new
program to evaluate instrumentation.
   ``What exactly is this all about, Jim?'' asked Harry. ``We have an
ongoing program to repair and upgrade obsolete instrumentation as you know.
We seem to get a fraction of upgrades done every year, limited mostly by
budgets and sometimes by the time available during shutdown periods.''
   ``Yes, Harry, and you've done an admirable job of keeping the program
going,'' admitted Jim. ``But corporate has noticed that the predicted
savings from new instrumentation never seem to get delivered, and that it
has been getting tougher each year for our Pilot operation to replicate our
results here.''
   ``Jim, you know as well as anyone here how often corporate falls on
their faces when it comes to practical stuff like tying their own
shoelaces. If I have a theoretical problem for them to solve I'll be the
first to give them a holler. We've always been able to solve our own stuff
without their interference.''
   ``I know, Harry. But times are different now. We don't have all the
horsepower we once had, and with Charlie ill and all, I just feel it's time
we figure out how to work with those corporate guys,'' said Jim. ``Let's
look at the reinstrumentation project as an opportunity for some
cooperation. Give it a shot and we'll see what happens. What do you say,
Harry?''
   ``All right, but I sure wish things were back to the way they were, even
though my head says that isn't possible,'' said Harry. ``We'll give it a
shot.''

The unexplained runaway
As tends to happen everywhere on Friday afternoons, what can go wrong does
-- and at the worst time. A near-fatal accident occurs that sets in motion
a process that dramatically changes how LargeAcres operates, and what
control systems it uses.
   That day, Harry gets a call about an unexpected, and unexplainable,
incident. Apparently, an operator had opened the reactor hatch on Unit 5 to
take a sample, and was almost doused with high temperature resin, which
would have surely severely injured if not killed him. The incident was
reported immediately since it also caused some damage to the reactor and
surrounding vessels. Pressure had built up without sufficient warning and
several safety systems, including the vent, had failed to relieve the
situation.
   Harry called for an immediate meeting to start the investigation and
alerted Jim. Jim decided to convene a special meeting Saturday morning of
his staff, the Unit 5 Engineers and Lead Operators, and Kathy.
   Harry didn't waste any time putting Kathy on the spot. ``Kathy, it
doesn't seem like your policy changes have kept this potentially fatal
incident from occurring with one of my best operators on the second shift.
What do you recommend we do now?''
   Newly appointed to the ESH position, Kathy knew that she would be tested
by production managers like Harry. She was also aware of the basic conflict
between them. Production managers are concerned with maintaining operation,
while corporate staff had to ensure safe operations and no corner-cutting.
   ``Clearly, we need to organize an investigation team, and it has to run
fast,'' she replied. She suggested several operations and engineering
people to fill out the team. Jim concurred.
   Kathy also suggested adding representatives of the two instrument
vendors that LargeAcres used, because there seemed to be some information
gaps in the overall control strategy. Harry resisted this, saying that the
team didn't have time to analyze everything yet maintain production; he
wanted to resolve safety issues quickly.
   ``We need all the help we can get,'' said Jim. ``Let's do it Kathy's
way, and keep to a tight schedule.''

The investigation
Four weeks passed with results coming in from R&D, the local team and the 
investigators from the two instrument vendors, GoodData and InfoControl
(InfoCon). Jane's R&D group was unable to determine the root cause of the
incident. It determined that without better process data too much was left
to speculation to be certain. There was a lack of consistency in the
stories from the operators and the engineers. GoodData proposed a new
control system to upgrade the existing one and replace the competition's
hardware. InfoCon made a totally different proposal.
   Michelle, the local account manager for InfoCon, had been working with
Harry to help him with the routine instrumentation projects on Unit 4. In
order to proceed, she was going to propose a ``Discovery Process'' to
determine appropriate next steps.
   She explained that the process is a scoping exercise that looks at the
economic and technical driving forces in use. It is helpful in uncovering
missing pieces of complex engineering puzzles. These pieces reside with
individuals in the plant, and with corporate or industry benchmarks (which
can be brought to light by the instrument vendors that may have seen
similar problems with customers), or other research.
   The key is to bring all the parties together to solve the puzzles and
brainstorm practical solutions for implementation. Economics are developed
for each approach at a budgetary or near budgetary-level of detail.
   Kathy and Harry sat down with the team to evaluate the options,
including the proposals for reinstrumenting the plant. The proposal from
GoodData was traditional and safe, and was favored by Harry and Charlie,
who had just returned from sick leave. Kathy favored the Discovery
approach. Harry was not set against Discovery, but feared excessive
disruption to production. He frankly wanted to just ``get on with it.''
After presentations from the vendors, Jim made the ``go'' decision to
work with InfoCon.
   Michelle explained what the process would entail: Acme and InfoCon would
co-sponsor a 2-1/2 day meeting to explore the process that is most in need
of attention. The first half-day would be used for training and setting
expectations with the team. This meeting could be followed up with other
sessions to explore other problems. Now, the primary objective would be to
produce a safer operation; a secondary objective would be to reduce
operating costs.
    The team needed a trained facilitator, an application engineer, a
project manager, the InfoCon account manager, relevant process and project
engineers, and the lead operators who knew the process best.
   ``Let's go ahead and schedule it for the earliest convenient date,''
said Jim. ``I'll help kickoff the meeting with objectives and review the
results at the end of the session.'' The meeting was scheduled for the
following Monday through Wednesday and it was deemed desirable to hold it
offsite at a nearby hotel. The process consisted of 12 steps:
  -- 1. Map the physical process, similar to an executive flow diagram
  -- 2. Superimpose the procedures commonly done by the successful
operators
  -- 3. Identify any missing pieces of information
  -- 4. Identify information dependencies from the rest of the operation
  -- 5. Identify best practices
  -- 6. Identify major concerns -- in this case, a lack of appropriate
process
    information
  -- 7. List all the identified best practices and concerns
  -- 8. Brainstorm ways to overcome the concerns using a user-vendor team
  -- 9. Evaluate the economics of equipment purchases, operational changes
and
    process cost savings
  -- 10. Create next steps and assignments
  -- 11. Review the exercise with management and other related process
owners
  -- 12. Integrate other teams' efforts

   Figure 2 depicts the approach, which borrows from workflow studies and
computer analysis. It is being treated as an adaptation to instrumentation
and control concepts due to the heavy reliance on the information flows in
today's operations. The gap created by this process is the driving force
between existing operations and the desired state of a future view.
   The multi-step implementation plan is a practical scheme for closing the
gap in a timely and cost-effective manner. Each of the steps is analyzed,
and costs and benefits are reestablished during implementation. In other
words, lessons learned from the first step of implementation are used to
evaluate the next step as the process continues through to final
development.
   As the team, led by the facilitator, went through the steps of the
process, a number of surprising conclusions surfaced. Most significantly,
the full team uncovered process conditions that could lead to safety
problems. Although process-safety meetings had been running more or less
continuously for years, the problem had not been revealed. The previous
evaluations had focused primarily on known data, conditions and procedures,
and not on unknown or unforeseen conditions.
   Another surprising result was that a whole host of long-term or vaguely
understood corporate goals were found to be of vital importance in how the
project was scoped out. For example, it was known that corporate management
was in a multi-year program to switch to a new type of business software,
which would require different types of operating systems and communication
links. But no one figured that these changes would affect production
management anytime soon, and therefore they had been ignored. Now, in
analyzing the interconnection of the future business and control software,
the team realized that not only did they have a fast track to implementing
the expected changes, they also had a powerful incentive to offer
management to justify the capital expenditure.

Presenting the results
When the Acme team members were ready to present their findings to Jim,
they made a list of the potential benefits of a revamped control system.
These would form the basis of recommended capital expenditures and services
if their plans were accepted:
  -- 1. A top-to-bottom review of operating procedures showed where
existing data was insufficient to plan procedures. An upgraded system would
be able to generate these data
  -- 2. The consequences of changing raw-material supplies were worked out.
When impurity levels change, the reaction speed is dramatically affected,
and side reactions occur. New instrumentation, and a data link between 
Jane's R&D laboratory and the production units, correct this situation
  -- 3. Document management, involving both the laboratory and the
production unit, could be upgraded by having a real-time link. When
impurity levels change, the system would be able to provide access to
stored laboratory data and documents for safety purposes
  -- 4. A long-term corporate goal of switching to another type of business
software, running on a different operating system, could be addressed.
Previously, the managers had expected that they would be the last to be
affected by the switchover; now they were in a position to be the first
production unit to take advantage of the software
  -- 5. Another production engineering goal, to consider the impact of new
industry data-communication standards, was shown to be a significant factor
in rationalizing the control strategies and updating control software. In
particular, the contents of the SP88 standard (CE, October 1995, p. 118)
would provide better management of batch recipes.
   ``We have been operating in LargeAcres in somewhat of a fog these last
few years,'' said Harry, in his concluding presentation. ``Our safety
mis-hap has opened the door to taking a fresh look at these topics.''

Six months later
In reviewing the records of plant operations since the accident, Jim found
many benefits, some of them not predicted. Customers are pleased that Acme
can meet its product schedules and changes. With the new batch management
software, control of inventory is enhanced, demurrage charges (for tankcars
held in storage) was reduced, and energy consumption was down.
   As Jim thought about all the improvements that he was seeing in plant
operations, he realized that the source was partly new technology --
especially the standardized, open software that allows better communication
among control and management systems, and partly a new way of analyzing
plant conditions that emerged during the Discovery Process. Because the
Process revealed new steps between ``things as they are'' and ``things as
they should be,'' Acme was able to take a leap forward in automation
technology, rather than the piecemeal approach of the past.

DON'T TAKE PIPE JOINTS FOR GRANTED
Paying close attention to flange bolts and welding methods can

In many respects, piping and tubing components are among the most reliable
parts of a process plant. However, pipe connections can be expensive to
install and may create crevices or ridges inside the pipe, which can
threaten sanitary conditions, or increase maintenance between batches.
   And, unless properly installed, many pipe connections offer potential
pathways for valuable, hazardous or toxic fluids to escape. During the
installation of flanged connections, flanges are typically bolted together
until a seasoned mechanic feels the connection is ``tight enough.'' Some
mechanics may use a torque wrench to ensure correct, uniform bolt
tightness. ``Bolted, flanged joints are always based on a specified bolt
load,'' says George Sturdevant, President of Houston-based Fastorq Bolting
Systems, Inc. ``But, what is often missing in the specification is how that
bolt load is to be achieved, and how the joint is to be inspected.''
   While a torque wrench is helpful in achieving the proper bolt loading,
the relationship between torque and bolt load is often poorly understood,
as it is a function of several hard-to-measure flange and bolt
characteristics, including friction, fit, finish, and lubricity. To avoid
flange leakage due to incorrect bolt loading, many joints include large
safety factors.
   Welding, although labor intensive, is often the least expensive way to
join pipes, but it creates permanent connections that need to be cut if the
pipe must be entered later. Where welded connections are desired, the use
of automatic welding machines is on the rise, says David Dodge, a
marketing manager at Dimetrics, Inc. (Davidson, N.C.), particularly in the
food, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor industries. ``Automatic welding
machines produce a smooth, flush internal bead, which eliminates crevices
where contamination could collect,'' he adds.
   In addition to producing welds of consistent quality at faster speeds
than manual welding, these machines provide a permanent record of the
operating conditions that took place when each weld was made. However, the
cost and setup time required to use automatic welding may limit its use.
   ``Manual welding is still often the most cost-effective method,'' says
Steve Burkel, President of Applied Energy Systems (Malvern, Pa.). As a rule
of thumb, he suggests that for pipe diameters up to about 8 in., about 10
or more identical welds would have to be performed for the automatic
welding machine to be more cost-effective. ``But for large, heavy-walled
pipe, or where clearance is restricted, or where an excess heat input is
required to control stress crack corrosion at the weld, automatic welding
may be appropriate for a single weld.''

Adding layers of protection
In recent years, the use of plastic-lined pipe has grown among process
operators. Many vendors have introduced bent piping systems that require
fewer flanged connections. Firms announcing recent product improvements
include Dow Plastic-Lined Piping Products (Bay City, Mich.), Crane
Resistoflex (Marion, N.C.) and Houston-based Performance Plastic Products
(see Removing joints from plastic-lined pipe, CE, November 1995, pp.
37-41).
   To join such systems, special plastic-lined flanges are bolted together.
With the launch of its new Conquest product line last month, Dow
Plastic-Lined Piping Products introduced a system that relies on mechanical
couplings instead of flanged connnections. These mechanical couplings can
be made in the field, and provide permanent connections that eliminate
leakage paths, and reduce ongoing maintenance.
   A variety of piping products are described below. These include lined
pipe systems, plastic tubing, high-alloy pipe for highly aggressive and
high-temperature applications, and a variety of accessories, including
quick-connects, seals for pressure testing and line isolation, and
expansion joints.

CORROSION: PREVENTION AND PROTECTION
New materials and new monitors battle equipment decay

The experienced corrosion engineer knows that corrosion tables from
handbooks and manufacturer's literature should be used for screening, not
selection. The data presented in those tables cannot possibly consider all
the process conditions that can influence corrosion rates.
    Actual performance of metals in corrosive service can often surprise
the most experienced corrosion specialist. Trace impurities (for example,
halogens) can produce corrosion rates substantially above the predictions
of corrosion charts and handbooks. Process upsets can also create brief
periods of composition changes that produce excessive corrosion rates.
   Erosion can also enhance corrosion. Many alloy metals rely on a passive
oxide coating to protect the base metal. If this coating is continually
eroded away by an abrasive slurry, a metal that would be virtually
corrosion free in a clean solution can corrode very rapidly.
   To prevent the unexpected corrosion failure of process equipment and to
test the performance of possible alternative alloys, many chemical plants
are monitoring actual process corrosion rates. ``Corrosion monitoring tools
range from very simple test coupons to very sophisticated instruments with
feedback controls,'' explains Dennis Pritchard, a vice president at Metal
Samples Co. (Munford, Ala.)
   Monitoring corrosion with test coupons consists of placing a small wafer
of the metal in the process stream and removing it periodically to check
for weight loss. These coupons can be inserted through a double valve
system, so the process need not be shut down to inspect the coupons. For
more frequent readings of corrosion rate, an electrical conductivity probe
can be installed in the process. Constructed of the metal being tested, the
probe gradually loses metal as corrosion proceeds. The drop in electrical
conductivity is directly related to corrosion rate.
   ``Conductivity probes can be highly sophisticated,'' notes Pritchard.
``They can provide a continuous readout of corrosion rate which, when
coupled with other process variables such as pH and temperature, allow the
engineer to determine how a metal fares under changing operating
conditions.'' He also notes that conductivity probes are often used as the
independent variable in control loops to adjust pH or add corrosion
inhibitors.

Redundant tests add flexibility
While corrosion coupons are generally considered more reliable than
conductivity probes, Jim Tauscher, a technician at Tennessee Eastman Div.,
Eastman Chemical Co. (Kingsport, Tenn.) finds the probes provide more rapid
indication of potential problems. ``We install coupons and conductivity
probes together in the process stream,'' he explains. ``When the probe
signals high metal loss, we check metal thickness of the vessel or pipe.
Usually, the probe predicts actual metal loss quite well.''
   Two additional tips come from Tauscher's experience. First, he finds
that laboratory tests of corrosion rates aren't nearly as reliable as using
in-process test coupons or conductivity probes. And second, he finds that
continuous recordings of corrosion rates often uncover upstream process
upsets that may otherwise go undetected.
   Alloy availability is often overlooked when studying alloy performance.
As Alan Gamble, president of Alloy Tech Inc. (Salem, N.H.), notes, ``Of all
the different alloys and shapes that can be made, few are actually
available from distributors. Unless you're willing to buy a large quantity
directly from the mill, and wait for the mill to make it, testing should
only be done on materials that you know meet your availability
requirements.''
   Some corrosive applications, such as acidic fluegases, lend themselves
to highly specific corrosion monitors. Designed to identify conditions that
create acidic condensation on the walls of the stack, the monitors can
provide data that help optimize combustion and heat utilization while
protecting the flue ducts.
    While a metal or metal alloy can usually be found that will handle a
corrosive application, plastic should also be considered when the pressure
and temperature are moderate. Plastic can often cost less, and provide less
potential for contaminating the process with corrosion products. This is
especially true for containment applications.
   The items below include plastic equipment, linings and coatings -- using
both thermoplastic and thermoset resins -- designed for aggressive
environments.

MAKE YOUR PROCESS WATER PAY FOR ITSELF
Pinch technology can be harnessed to minimize raw-water demand and
wastewater generation alike

By:
Vikas R. Dhole, Nand Ramchandani, Richard A. Tainsh, and Marek Wasilewski
Linnhoff March Ltd.
Edited by Nicholas P. Chopey


Environmental protection, rising costs for wastewater-treatment, and at
many sites a shortage of fresh water are all persuasive motives for
reducing raw water consumption and wastewater discharge at a
chemical-process plant. Maximizing the re-use of water within the plant can
be of great help. Systematic strategies for such maximization can lower
freshwater usage and wastewater discharges by 50% or more, while also
significantly reducing capital investment in treatment facilities.
   The typical base case or starting point for such improvements appears in
Figure 1, which shows a conventional water network in a process plant.
After undergoing initial treatment, the incoming water goes in parallel
streams to the various individual process units, as well as to the utility
system for steam production and for use in cooling towers. Wastewater
streams from the processes, along with blowdown and condensate losses from
the utility system, are usually collected together and the combined stream
fed to a wastewater treatment facility prior to discharge.

The options available
There are two basic strategies for reducing water demand in such a plant.
One strategy consists of modifying individual process and utility units to
reduce their inherent need for water. Examples include replacing water
cooling with air cooling, improving controls of boiler and cooling-tower
blowdowns, and increasing the number of stages in an extraction unit that
employs water as its extractant.
   In the other basic strategy, which is the main focus of this article,
the engineer seeks opportunities to use the outlet water from one operation
to satisfy the water requirement of another or the same operation. In some
cases, the water may require some regeneration prior to re-use. Examples of
regeneration include pH adjustment, filtration, membrane separation,
sour-water stripping and ion exchange.
   Unfortunately, such attempts to lower freshwater use and wastewater
generation are usually carried out piecemeal: Designs of individual units
are improved and water-reuse opportunities acted upon without considering
the overall plant as a whole. Now, however, newer approaches are available
in which all of the plant's process and utility units can be systematically
treated as one entity [2,3,4].

Early focus on mass transfer
All such systematic approaches known to us include elements of pinch
technology [1]. Increasingly used in the process industries since the early
1980s, the initial embodiment of pinch technology offers a way to solve
complex multi-stream heat integration problems by converting stream data
into a visual representation on temperature and enthalpy axes. As there are
parallels between heat transfer and mass transfer, the established
principles of thermal pinch analysis can be extended to fresh- and
wastewater minimization.
   The first moves in that direction came in 1989, when El-Halwagi and
Manousiouthakis at the University of California, Los Angeles [2] addressed
a more general problem of mass exchange between a set of rich process
streams and a set of lean streams. Five years later, Wang and Smith at the
University of Manchester [England] Institute of Science and Technology [3]
specifically addressed the water-minimization problem, by considering it as
a contamination-transfer problem from process streams to water streams.
   Both of these approaches are based on the model of a process unit as a
mass-transfer unit (Figure 2): Contaminant moves from the rich process
stream to the water stream. The mass- transfer driving force is indicated
by the gap between the process and water stream profiles plotted on
concentration and mass-transferred axes.
   Focus your attention for a moment on the Wang and Smith approach.
Although space limitations do not permit a usable, step-by-step
explanation, the first task consists of developing a limiting water profile
for each water-using process operation, based on maximum inlet and outlet
concentrations for the water stream for each operation.
   The limiting water-stream concentrations of all the process units are
combined together to construct the limiting composite curve for the overall
plant. A fresh-water line is then constructed, and matched against the
limiting composite curve to set the minimum fresh-water demand for the
overall plant (Figure 3a).
   The minimum-fresh-water line touches the limiting composite curve at two
points: at zero concentration and at an intermediate position called the
pinch point. This line, which corresponds to the minimum water flowrate
required for the plant, establishes the ``target'' for maximizing water
re-use. The limiting composite curve construction also shows critical
sections of the plant (regions close to pinch concentration) that require
especially close attention in order to achieve the minimum water
requirement.
   To develop the water-reuse network that minimizes the fresh-water
demand, the Wang and Smith approach uses network-design methodology
analogous to the pinch design method from heat integration. The initial
network thus obtained tends to have a complex structure, but an
evolutionary procedure then simplifies this to yield a practical network
(Figure 3b).
   Unfortunately, the sequence as just described deals with only one
contaminant. Accounting for multiple contaminants requires more-complex
construction of limiting composite curves, as well as more-involved network
design [3].
   Another drawback to the approach is its use of contaminant mass transfer
as the basis for modeling. Many process units, such as reactors, boilers
and cooling towers, cannot readily be described as contaminant mass
transfer units.
   Furthermore, it is difficult to model situations, not uncommon in
process plants, in which several water-based streams enter and leave the
process unit at different concentrations. And, the approach does not
directly address practical constraints such as geographical distances (long
pipe runs) and other constraints that may forbid re-use of water from one
unit to another.
   In spite of these practical problems, the Wang and Smith approach has
served as the pioneering tool for water minimization. We ourselves have
employed it on projects of this type. Furthermore, that experience gave us
the basis for developing a newer approach for wastewater minimization that
overcomes the problems outlined above.

Two composite plots
In this approach, each relevant process or utility operation within the
overall plant is considered as having aqueous input and output streams.
There can be several of each, at different purities, in a single operation.
The approach involves a combination of new graphical and mathematical
techniques, and is trademarked WaterPinch.
   The graphical procedure is analogous to the familiar method from pinch
technology [1]. The engineer can plot the input aqueous streams of all
relevant operations into a combined ``demand composite'' form, on a graph
having purity as its vertical axis and aqueous-stream flowrate as its
horizontal axis. This composite defines the water demands, in terms of
required input purities for the individual streams, for the overall plant.
Similarly the output water streams of all the operations can be plotted to
construct the ``source composite'' for the plant, defined in terms of the
minimum output purities of the individual streams.
   An example for a plant having five process units appears in Figure 4.
Note that the numbers on the vertical axis increase downward, not upward --
that is, purity is measured in terms of the amount of contamination
present, with the zero-contamination point (i.e., the highest purity)
occupying the highest point on the vertical axis and the concentration
numbers representing successively greater contamination descending along
the scale. Note also that the supply and demand composites are overlapped
until they just avoid a crossover, and thus define the ``pinch point''
between the two composites.
   As an example of how the individual line segments of the composites are
plotted, consider first Segment A on the water-sources composite. It
represents a stream leaving Process Unit A whose flowrate is 43 tons/h (as
shown by its length, i.e., 130 2 87 measured against the horizontal axis)
and whose contaminant level is 70 ppm (as measured against the vertical
axis). Similarly, Segment B represents a stream of 48 tons/h (178 2 130
against the horizontal axis) leaving Process Unit B, with a contaminant
level of 47 ppm. As for Segment C on the water-demands composite, it
represents Process Unit C's requirement for 106 tons/h (238 2 132) of water
whose contaminant level is no higher than 65 ppm.
   The overlap between the source and the demand composite, shown by the
shaded area, indicates the potentialities for water reuse. The available
overlap is limited by the pinch point. The representation in Figure 4 also
identifies targets for minimum fresh water demand and wastewater
generation.
   The pinch point and the composite curves help to identify design
improvements in an existing plant. In the first place, the sources should
provide water to demands on the same side of the pinch. Flow of water from
a source above the pinch to a demand below the pinch will increase the
consumption beyond the target. Using fresh water to satisfy demands below
the pinch, or sending water from sources above the pinch to waste
treatment, will have the same effect.
   The representation also helps the engineer identify design modifications
that can further improve the targets for a plant. Figure 5 shows an
example. By mixing Streams A and B described in Figure 4, we can generate a
91-ton/h stream of intermediate purity (58 ppm), shown as ``Mix'' in Figure
5a. Because this stream is pure enough to satisfy part of the Segment C
demand for 106 tons/h of 65-ppm (or purer) water, the pinch-point
bottleneck shown in Figure 4 is relieved, allowing further overlap of the
source and demand composites and increasing the overall water recovery in
the process.
   The diagram also provides specific design guidelines to maximize the
re-use of water, as shown in Figure 5b. For example, it indicates that the
water mixture from outlets of units A and B needs to supply water to unit
C, and that the remaining water demand for unit C can be satisfied by part
of the water outlet from unit D.
   The visual representation typified by Figures 4 and 5 can also be
presented and manipulated via an equivalent mathematical model. The model
enables the user to deal with complex water networks, having multiple
contaminants and large number of process operations. For such problems the
user may find it easier to start with the mathematical model and then
visualize the simplified solutions.
   Use of the model also lets the engineer take into account certain
practical issues for which the visual representation would be irrelevant.
Examples include geographical and operability constraints, and varying
costs of fresh waters and of wastewater treatment.
   The mathematical model is completely compatible with the visual
representation: The user can switch between mathematical and visual modes
at any stage. The two are also complementary, the visual tool improving
engineering understanding and the mathematical model allowing the handling
of complex problems.

to the improved process configuration that appears in Figure 5b

A REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE
The capabilities of water minimization can better be appreciated by
considering the results from a recent project involving Monsanto PLC at
Newport, Gwent, Wales [7].
   Up to now, effluents from seven process plants at the complex have been
collected together, and the resulting mixture adjusted for pH and then
discharged along an outflow into the River Severn estuary. Recently, the
U.K.'s National Rivers Authority indicated that the resulting discharge
levels are not acceptable in the long term. Accordingly, Monsanto decided
to reduce discharged COD by 90%. Doing so via a conventional, centralized
treatment system would have required capital outlays of $15 million.
   However, applying the WaterPinch approach has revealed that the site's
fresh-water consumption could be cut by 30%. The resulting decrease in
effluent volume significantly lowers the required size of the treatment
facility. What's more, process changes suggested by the water-minimization
study reduce the COD load by 76%.
   As a result, the required capital expenditure has shrunk to $3.5
million. Additional benefits include a savings of $300,000/yr in
fresh-water cost and $700,000/yr in raw materials that would have been 
lost in the effluent from the larger treatment plant. As a result of the
project, Monsanto and Linnhoff March won the 1995 TCE Excellence in Safety
and Environment award bestowed by the Institution of Chemical Engineers,
U.K.

DISPOSABLE CARTRIDGE FILTERS SIZING UP
The choice of the optimum filter depends on factors such as flow
conditions, fluid viscosity and size of the solid contaminants

By:
Joseph Swiezbin, Tony Uberoi and Jane J. Janas, Pall Corp.
Edited by Deborah Hairston


The filtration spectrum spans a broad range of contaminant types and
particle sizes that can be selectively removed from a fluid or gas via a
porous medium [1]. Within this domain, several separation processes are
available, from reverse osmosis to particle filtration (Table 1).
   At the top of the spectrum is the ionic range -- where hyperfiltration
techniques are used for removal of particles smaller than 0.001 m. An
example is reverse osmosis, a membrane diffusion process. In this process,
pressure is applied to solutions of low-molecular-weight solutes in contact
with a membrane. By use of solution-diffusion mechanisms, a solution lower
in solute concentration is produced.
   To remove higher-mass particles, coarser particles in the molecular
range, ultrafiltration is specified. Ultrafilters, which clarify colloids
in the range of 0.002-0.02 m, are used. While reverse osmosis requires
pressure up to 600 psi, ultrafilters operate with pressure on the order of
50 psi.
   Microfiltration and particle filtration, for clarification of
contaminants in the range of 0.01-120 m, can be accomplished with
disposable filter elements, which are designed as bag or cartridge
configurations. This article focuses on the selection of disposable
cartridge filters. Less expensive and more convenient than cleanable
filters, cartridge filters should be carefully matched with the product
being filtered to achieve the desired results. Specifying the optimum
filter will help meet product specifications and potentially avoid future
processing problems.
   Cartridge filters typically consists of a porous medium, in a pleated or
depth style, supported by a core. Many standard filters are built in
multiple lengths of 10 in., with an outside dia. of 2.5 or 2.75 in. A
depth-style cartridge has a thick, continuous filter medium that may be:
  -- String wound. Typically does not have a fixed pore structure and may
release contaminants under differential pressure load
  -- Molded fiber. Has a fixed pore structure, is flow resistant, and
compared with other styles of depth filters, may have a lower service life
  -- High-efficiency depth filter. Typically has a fixed-pore structure,
possesses a continuously graded prefilter layer and constant-pore diameter
section, features uniform compressibility and density, high voids volume,
and typically has a long service life

   A pleated-style cartridge features a filter medium that is folded into
pleats that may be:
  -- Triangular-shaped. Geometrically fold-ed sheets of medium
  -- Crescent-shaped. Slightly curved to provide the advantages of both
triangular-pleated and high-efficiency depth-style media

   When, as is typical, the particle concentration is low -- less than 100
ppm or 0.01% by weight -- a depth-type cartridge filter is used to trap the
contaminants. At higher concentrations, the filtration mechanism of bulk
solids removal by cake filtration, may operate. At these higher loadings,
the solids can form a cake on the surface of the filter medium. Use of
backwashable fixed-pore depth media, metal filters, or a finer-rated,
fixed-pore medium with a large pleated surface area, may be appropriate.
   While there is no sharp dividing line for choosing any one type of
disposable filter over another, there are several variables that should be
considered in the selection of the optimum filter for a given application:
  -- Nature of the fluid. Compatibility, viscosity, hazard class, value
  -- Process conditions. Flow rate, density, temperature, pressure drop,
batch or continuous process
  -- Type of solid contaminants. Shape, quantity, structure and size, to
determine the degree of filtration required

   Any combination of these factors can determine the final selection of
filter configuration. The purchase price for cartridge filters, along with
the frequency of filter changeout and effluent quality, must be weighed
against the labor, disposal and downtime costs. Once the benchmark criteria
are established, the benefits should exceed the investment cost of the
filter and its use.

Nature of the fluid
As a rule of thumb, any filter component, including the medium, hardware,
housing, O-rings and gaskets, that come in contact with a chemical being
filtered should be compatible with that fluid at operating conditions. A
soak test can verify compatibility once the fluids class -- acid, alkali,
aqueous, oil or solvent -- and percent composition are identified. There is
a broad array of filter materials to consider, among them cellulose, fiber
glass, polypropylene, nylon, cellulose esters, fluorinated polymers and
aramides.
   Viscosity, the resistance of a fluid to the motion of its molecules, is
a measure of the ability of a fluid to flow. The lower the viscosity, the
faster the fluid will flow at a given driving force. (Water has a viscosity
of one cP at 20C.) Because viscosity directly affects the pressure drop
across a set of filters, pleated cartridges and bag filters, with their
larger surface areas to reduce resistance to fluid flow, should be
considered for fluids with a viscosity typically greater than 50 cP.
   Under extreme pressure differentials, there is a potential risk of
collapse for some triangular-pleat constructions. If compatible, use of the
crescent-shaped pleated-style cartridge is also recommended and may be
preferable for some of these applications. The effect of fluid flow is even
more pronounced for applications that require filters rated 20-m absolute
and finer.
   If a spent cartridge contains hazardous waste, then a pleated cartridge,
a configuration that can pack more filter area into a given volume than
that of either a bag or depth filter, may be the optimum choice. The filter
life is longer, and there are fewer filters to remove from the housing and
discard.
   Bag filters, which consist of a porous medium shaped in a bag- or
sock-like structure, are a second choice. Some standard sizes are 4 in.
dia., with lengths of 9 and 15 in., and 7 in. dia., with lengths of 17 and
33 in.
   Although more bags are required to match the service life of pleated
elements, bags may be tightly compacted for disposal.
   If the process fluid is considered expensive, pleated cartridges, may be
the best choice. Pleated elements retain less fluid than do either bag
filters or depth cartridges.

Process conditions
Pleated cartridges are often the optimum choice when long service life is
required. At fine ratings, flow resistance is lower than that of either a
bag or depth filter due to increased surface area. Consequently a smaller,
less expensive housing will suffice for a pleated configuration. For
flow-rates of 250 gal/min or greater, in applications requiring 20-m
absolute or finer filtration, a pleated cartridge may be the best choice.
   It is important to monitor the temperature of a process. Some disposable
media or hardware cannot withstand prolonged exposure to high temperatures.
For high-temperature service above 250F, filters made of metal or ceramic
may be preferred.
   The life of a disposable filter is determined by the service conditions
and actual filter construction. Filter life may relate to its dirt
capacity. A large void volume, or open area of a medium, increases the life
of a filter and affords a lower, clean pressure drop. The life of most
filters is greatly increased as flow density is decreased [2]. The
relationship comparing service life (t = filter life in minutes, hours or
days) to flow density [J = flow density in gal/(min)(ft2)] is given by the
following:
  -- t2 = t1 (J1/J2)n where n = extension factor (dimensionless), 1 and 2
refer to the trials.
   The life extension factor (n) is experimentally determined and has a
value such that: 1 n 2 (Figure 1). Filter life of a chosen configuration
of filters is increased substantially by reducing the flow density to the
elements. The life extension factor will approach two if:
  1. Filter cake is not compressible
  2. Collected cake does not filter finer than the filter
  3. Solids collected are of a uniform diameter

   Therefore, it is generally more economical to install more filters for a
given flow rate. However, it is advisable to perform a cost-benefit
analysis. As stated previously, filtration benefits must equal or exceed
the investment and operating costs of the filter before a selection is
made.
   Total pressure drop, developed across the filter housing, is comprised
of resistance to flow through the piping, the filter's hardware and the
filter medium. The finer the filter rating, the smaller the diameter of the
medium's pores for nondepth-type filters, and the greater the resistance to
the fluid flow, resulting in higher differential pressure. In the selection
of a disposable filter assembly, there must be sufficient pressure to
overcome the initial resistance to flow and to maintain flow as the filter
medium plugs.
   Filter life is enhanced by properly sizing the cartridge to achieve a
low initial clean differential pressure (typically sized at <5 psid). Once
the knee of the characteristic curve of pressure drop versus time for
constant flow is reached, the differential pressure across the filter rises
rapidly (Figure 2). Disposable cartridges and bag filters can generally
withstand 60-80 psid in the forward direction before they begin to fail
structurally. For higher differential pressures, metal filters are the
construction of choice.
   For continuous filtration applications, where long service life is
desired, pleated cartridges are often the optimum choice. Their high
surface areas provide longer service life. For batch filtration operations,
or when filters are changed out after use to avoid cross contamination, a
depth filter may be the optimum choice to fully utilize the life of the
filter before changeout. Furthermore, when filters are changed out
batch-to-batch, the lower-cost depth filter may be the optimum choice.

Types of solid contaminants
To define the effective size of the
contaminant and to determine the de-gree of filtration required, the filter
removal efficiency is a convenient tool. Filters for the chemical process
industries are typically rated by the ``challenge'' system, wherein a
filter is challenged by pumping through it a suspension of a readily
recognized contaminant, such as glass beads, or siliceous or bacterial
suspensions.
   To determine the maximum particle size and assign a removal rating to
the filter, the filtrate is examined for the presence or absence of the
test contaminant downstream. The absolute rating is defined as the removal
of contaminants greater than the size specified. String-wound depth filters
are typically unable to achieve an absolute rating because they do not have
a fixed-pore construction.
   Along with the maximum particle size test, the gravimetric efficiency
test is derived from military specifications. The weight of feed
contaminant to effluent contaminant is determined, and the filter
efficiency rating is assigned.
   The Beta Ratio is the most informative and useful method to express a
filter's removal efficiency and performance over its service life. The test
protocol is an adaption of Oklahoma State University's F-2 filter
performance test [3], modified for the rapid semiautomatic testing of
filters with aqueous fluids in a single pass mode [4]. Using continuous
online particle counters set at several particle sizes, both upstream and
downstream of the test filter, the counts are recorded throughout the life
of the filter (Figure 3). The Beta Ratio, at a specific particle size (x)
is defined as:

(This formular is not available elctronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

   Whereas Bx = 1 represents 0% efficiency at size x, Bx = 2 represents 50%
efficiency at size x, and Bx = 10 represents 90% efficiency, Bx = 5,000
represents 99.8% efficiency at size x, and is typically called the absolute
rating. By tabulating the Beta Ratio values of different filters, the
configuration of a filter can be selected that meets the requirements of a
given application (Figure 4).
   If the process contaminants are gelatinous, a depth-style filter may be
the optimum choice, as gels are trapped in the filter medium where they
could possibly deform and extrude through a pleated or bag filter that is
thinner. If the contaminants form a porous cake, or if the solids loading
is on the high side, a bag filter may be the best choice for the
application.

Cost considerations
The selection of a filter for a specific application depends on the nature
of the fluid, the process conditions, and the type of contaminants. Because
any combination of these factors can determine the final selection,
knowledge of these factors and a careful review of specifications with
filter vendors are essential to making the right choice. When per-element
cost is the primary issue, the depth filter is the first choice.
   Low initial cost must balance frequency of filter changeout -- without
its labor, disposal and downtime cost -- to get a total cost of ownership
value (Table 2). But ultimately, the selected filter must meet all
criteria, as specified by the customer, and provide an economically viable
solution to the filtration application.

WELD OVERLAY RESISTS CORROSION AND EROSION

This pulse-arc welding process produces deposits with only 5-8% dilution,
resulting in better weld chemistry and improved corrosion resistance. By
oscillating the weld torch in the direction of the weld pass, the process
is highly effective at burning out surface contamination and pinholes, so
less weld repairs are necessary. The oscillation also produces a tempering
effect that reduces weld hardness, so hot cracks or micro- fissuring is
less likely.--Geo. P. Reintjes Co., Kan- sas City, Mo.

WHY PATENT MY INVENTION?
Know how to protect your intellectual property

By:
John Wilson Jones, Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoon
Edited by Irene Kim


As an engineer, you're accustomed to keeping your research efforts secret
and following strict company protocols. Unfortunately, these efforts can't
guarantee that you'll reap all the benefits of your work. Often, you may
need to take another step to protect your invention -- applying for a
patent.
   If you think your invention is patentable, act quickly to get necessary
legal processes started right away. In the meantime, don't discuss or share
your work with anyone outside your company.
   This article covers U.S. patents. For information on non-U.S. patents,
try multinational organizations, such as the European Patent Office (box,
p. 118). Whatever intellectual-property protection you're considering,
always check with a patent attorney.

Prepare the groundwork
First, you'll need to determine if your work can be patented. Talk to a
patent attorney to discuss the possibilities.
   People often want to skip the essential step of conducting a patent
search. Anxious to have his or her work protected, an engineer might say,
``File the application now; we'll worry about patentability later.''
Although this approach succeeds on rare occasions, it's often dangerous to
skip the search. You might file an application that infringes on someone
else's patent.
   A crucial step in the patenting process is the search. Don't make the
mistake of thinking that your invention can be patented if it hasn't yet
appeared in a journal or in the marketplace. Browsing through chemical
abstracts or the shelves of local variety stores does not constitute a
patentability search. You'll need to thoroughly comb U.S. and foreign
patents.
   Although many engineers know they'll need a lawyer later on to draft a
patent application, few understand how important it is to use an attorney
for their search. The costs of determining patentability are a fraction of
those you'd spend on drafting and filing a patent application.
   For instance, if you chose to conduct a search on your own, you might
not conduct it thoroughly. And you might find that someone's already
patented the invention you thought was original -- only after you've hired
an attorney at considerable expense to file your patent application.
   The more you know about existing patents, the better you're equipped to
protect your invention. A well-conducted search enables you to accurately
judge how you should define the claims of your patent. The way you present
your application determines the scope of protection your work will
receive.
   For example, if your process can be slightly modified to work in a
number of different industries, your search may reveal that none of these
variants have been patented -- and so you can claim all of them in your
application. But if you describe only the basic process in the application,
other people may later be able to patent the variants. (For more-detailed
information about what to claim in a patent, see CE, September 1993, p.
120.)
   If your search determines that your invention is indeed patentable, you
must decide whether to apply for a patent or keep your work a trade secret
(box, p. 118). Basically, a patent gives you the exclusive right to
practice your invention for no more than 20 years from the date you file
the patent application; by contrast, trade-secret status means that you
may be able to keep your invention out of the public domain indefinitely.

No matter what, mum's the word
If you decide to apply for a patent, don't talk about or disclose your
invention to anyone outside your organization until after the application
is filed in the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO; Washington, D.C.).
Inadvertent disclosure of your work to a third party can ruin your
company's foreign and U.S. marketing plans for the invention.
   In most non-U.S. countries, you lose your right to patent if you
disclose your invention before filing. In the U.S., however, you can file
for up to one year after the date of first disclosure. However, it's
advisable not to disclose your invention under most circumstances.
   For example, if you talk to someone about your invention before filing,
that person might try to patent your invention. This frequently happens
when an inventor collaborates with someone (a ``third party'') on part of
the research. The third party then files a separate application, thinking
that he or she, not the named inventor, is the actual inventor of the
idea.
   In such a case, what generally happens is that the USPTO declares a
conflict, or ``interference,'' between the applicants. No matter what the
final outcome, one result is inevitable: sky-high legal fees for the named
inventor.

Document your efforts
You can lose your right to a patent if you haven't maintained appropriate
records of your work. While the patent application is pending, you may
need to produce records that document two dates:
  -- Conception date. This is the point at which a coworker could take over
the invention, continuing to work on it without making an additional
invention
  -- Reduction-to-practice date. The invention was actually completed by
this date, and must have been shown to accomplish its intended purpose
   The documentation chronicling these dates can also be vital in later
litigation. For example, you'll need these records in case of later
interference.

PATENT OR TRADE SECRET?

Trade-secret status is inferred to an invention when it is not disclosed to
a third party. A U.S. patent, on the other hand, allows you to prevent
others from practicing (using, making or selling) your invention. Until
June 1994, the patent term was 17 years from the date the patent was
granted; now it is 20 years from the application-filing date.
   In order to obtain a patent, you must fully disclose your work. Not only
must you clearly explain all embodiments of the invention (e.g., variants)
-- you must also set forth the best mode of operating the invention. You
cannot receive a patent on an idea while simultaneously shielding important
aspects of the invention. You cannot, for instance, obtain a patent on a
new detergent without disclosing the preferred ratios of components of the
detergent and how it is made.
   In typical circumstances, your company will most want to patent those
aspects of your invention that can be most easily analyzed, or ``back
engineered.'' For instance, if your detergent is easily analyzed, you'll
probably want to patent the composition.
   At the same time, you want to patent those aspects of your invention
that you consider the most important. For example, if the crux of your work
is a new process for preparing detergent (rather than the composition), you
may choose to patent the process, and not the composition.
   Another factor to consider, when you're deciding whether or not to
patent, is the likelihood that a competitor could independently invent the
same thing. If you invent a process that you decide to make a trade secret
(rather than patenting), and your competitor Company X comes up with the
same process, Company X may file for and receive a patent. In this case,
you'd be barred from using your own invention for the 20-year life of
Company X's patent.
   Whether you decide to make the invention a trade secret or to patent it,
do not disclose it to anyone outside the company. If your company decides
to keep the invention a company secret, employees should not disclose the
invention to anyone outside the corporation. Documents disclosing or
discussing the invention should be clearly marked ``Confidential.'' Such
documents should be circulated within the company on a need-to-know basis
only. When you dispose of these documents, shred them -- don't just toss
them in a wastebasket.

A SHORTCUT FOR DESIGNING EVAPORATORS
A simple and fast method for finding the optimum number of effects

By:
M.I. Alejandro Anaya Durand, Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo
Edited by Jayadev Chowdhury


Multiple-effect evaporation is commonly used in chemical process plants to
minimize energy consumption and cooling water. In this system, several
evaporators are connected by piping so that vapor passes from one effect to
the next in series. Thus, the heat supplied to the first evaporator is used
to vaporize water in the first effect; this vapor, in turn, passes to the
next effect, until, finally, the heat in the vapor supplied to the last
effect passes on to the condenser.
   The net result of this arrangement is the multiple reuse of heat, and a
marked increase in the economy of the evaporation system. This economy in
evaporation is defined as the ratio of the overall water evaporated to the
amount of steam provided to the first effect. An increase in the number of
effects represents an increase in evaporation economy. A rough
approximation of the economy is obtained by multipliying the number of
effects by 0.8.
   In addition to savings in steam use, there is also a saving in condenser
cooling water as the number of effects increases. This is because the
equipment has to handle only the evaporation of the last effect.
   On the other hand, an increase in the number of effects represents an
increase in capital costs since more heat transfer area is required in the
evaporator system. Thus, the choice of the proper - that is, optimum -
number of effects is dictated by an economic balance between the savings in
steam and cooling water versus that of the additional investment costs.

The basic equations
The procedure is based on the simplified method developed by J. Coates and
B. Presburg to analyze and calculate the performance of multiple-effect
evaporation [1]. Here, the series resistance concept is considered, as
follows:
(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)
   The way to evaluate the terms of the above equation is suggested by
Coates. The key equations are:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)
where, lav is the ``average'' latent heat of the vapors through the
evaporator, and tLi is the temperature of the liquor in the effect the feed
enters regardless of whether it is in the first effect or not. The factor b
equals (1 + 0.1n) for the forward-feed case, and may be taken as 1.0 for
all other cases.
   An ``effective'' overall heat-transfer coefficient of the evaporator can
be calculated by employing the series-resistance concept.
   U subscript E = 1 / (1/U subscript 1 + 1/U subscript 2 + ...+ 1 / U
subscript n) (4)

The overall temperature difference in the evaporators can be evaluated by
the equation:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

where, ts is the temperature of the steam to the evaporator and tn is the
boiling point of the liquor in the last effect. The boiling-point-elevation
effect is not considered in this equation.
   The temperature differences in each effect can be estimated by
considering similar heat loads in each effect

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

Also, to minimize fabrication costs, it is normal to design the evaporators
so that each effect is equal in area; then:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

Equations (5) and (7) can be employed to determine the temperature
differences in each effect, with assumed values for the overall
heat-transfer coefficients.
   The overall heat-transfer equation through the multiple-effect
evaporator can be expressed by the equation

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

Steam consumption is estimated from the heat transferred in the first
effect

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

Therefore, the steam consumption is:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)

The amount of vapor from the last effect to the condenser may be calculated
by employing the simplifying assumption that the evaporations from each
effect are equal:
(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.) (11)

  The cooling water required for the condenser is obtained from the heat
balance of the system, by considering the vapor from the last effect.
   W = En[ln + Cw (tn twi)] / (two-twi) (12)
Solving Equation 8 for SA, and combining it with Equations 2, 3, 4 and 5
gives:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.) (13)
   To solve this equation, assumed values for heat transfer coefficients
for each effect must be given.
   If the feed is available at relatively low temperatures, then backward
evaporator operation - in which feed enters the last effect - is often
used. In this system, tLi equals the boiling point of the fluid in the last
effect, and depends on the pressure in the condenser. The numerator of
Equation 13 and the terms (ts - tn) are independent of the number of
effects of the evaporator considered, and can be evaluated for the design
conditions. Thus, the overall area required, SA, can be calculated quickly
and easily with such equation, by evaluating the term for the heat-transfer
coefficients (in the brackets in the denominator) for the different number
of effects considered.
   Similarly, Equations 9 and 10 can be rearranged to determine the steam
consumption:

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.) (14)

Also, for backward operation, only the last term of the of the above
equation is affected by the number of effects, and so the other terms are
evaluated for the design conditions of the evaporator. Thus, steam
consumption can be calculated for the number of effects considered.

Economic analysis
The total annual costs, CT, of the multiple-effect evaporator are the sum
of the capital fixed costs plus the operating costs.
   C subscript T = C subscript F + C subscript O (15)

   An increase in the number of evaporator effects represents an increase
in the fixed costs and a decrease in operating costs. CI is the minimum
total costs for an ``optimum'' number of effects.
   The fixed costs may be evaluated by the following equation:
(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.) (16)

Epsilon Alpha is the overall area of evaporation, ft superscript 2
C subscript ao is the cost of evaporation, $/ft superscript 2
K subscript f is the annual fixed charges, expressed as a fraction of
initial cost, for installed unit, dimensionless
C subscript F is the fixed costs, $/yr

The operating costs mainly consist of the steam costs together with the
cooling water costs:
C subscript O = W subscript U H subscript Y C subscript U (17)

W subscript U is the flowrate of the utility, lb/h
H subscript Y is the hours of operation per year
C subscript U is the cost of utility, $/lb
C subscript O is the operating costs, $/yr

   With the calculated values of evaporator area (A in Equation 13), steam
consumption (S in Equation 14), and of cooling-water requirements (Wc in
Equation 12), the total annual costs can be solved (CT in Equation 15).
   The above procedure can be quickly carried out for other numbers of
effects in the evaporator. For instance, if an increase in the number of
effects leads to a reduction in the total costs (CT), it may represent an
economically attractive increase in the number of effects. Naturally, the
number of effects that gives the minimum total costs represents the optimum
one.

An example
A solution with a neglible boiling-point elevation is to be concentrated
from 10 to 50% solids in a multiple-effect evaporator. Steam is available
at a pressure of 15 psig and at 249 degrees F. The absolute pressure in the
last effect is 4 in. Hg (the boiling point is 125 degrees F).
   The feed enters at 70 degrees F to the last effect (backward feed), at a
rate of 55,000 lb/h. The specific heat of the solutions may be taken as 1.0
Btu/(lb)(degrees F) at all concentrations.
   First, we need to estimate the heat-transfer area needed for a
triple-effect evaporator. The estimated heat-transfer coefficients are 450
in the first effect, 350 in the second, and 250 in the third.
   Secondly, we need to find out if a quadruple-effect may be economically
attractive. The estimated heat-transfer coefficients are 450 in the flrst
effect, 350 in the second, 300 in the third and 250 in the fourth.

Economic data
The evaporator cost (installed) may be estimated by the following empirical
equation: C subscript ao, $/ft superscript 2 = 11.24 (A) + 7,314
Annual fixed charges, K subscript f = 10% of the initial costs
Hours of operation per year, H subscript y = 8,000
Cooling water (available at 70 degrees F) costs, C subscript U = $0.1/1,000
gal
Steam costs, CU = $2.7/1,000 lb

Triple-effect evaporator
Evaporation rate, (This equation is not available electronically. Please
see January 1996, issue.)

The ``effective'' overall heat-transfer coefficient (Equation 4), U
subscript E = 1 / [(1 / 450) + (1 / 350) + (1 / 250)]= 110.14 Btu/h (ft2) 
degrees F

Operating conditions at the third effect, T subscript Li = 125 degrees F
(boiling point)

(This equation is not available electronically. Please see January 1996,
issue.)(vapor's latent heat) For backward feed, b = 1

The overall evaporator area, (This equation is not available
electronically. Please see January 1996, issue.)

Steam consumption (steam at 249 degrees F, 945 Btu/lb latent heat), S =
[55,000 (1)
(125 - 70) + {44,000 (1,022 - [1,022 (2/3)]}] / 945 = 19,380 lb/h

The economy of the triple-effect evaporator = 44,000 / 19,380 = 2.27
The estimated amount of vapor to the condenser = 44,000 / 3 = 14,667 lb/h
   If the temperature difference between the vapor and the outlet cooling
water in the condenser is around 5 degrees F, then the cooling-water
requirements at the condenser are:
W subscript c = 14,667 [1,022 + (1) (122 - 117)] / (117 - 70) = 320, 489
lb/h

Quadruple-effect evaporator
The ``effective'' heat transfer coefficient,
U subscript E = 1 / [(1 / 450) + (1 / 350) + (1 / 300) + (1 / 250)] =
80.56

The overall evaporation area, (This equation is not available
electronically. Please see January 1996, issue.)

The steam consumption, S = [55,000 (1) (125 - 70) + 44,000 {1,022 - [1,022
(3/4)]}] / 945 = 15,097 lb/h
The economy of the quadruple-effect evaporator = 44,000 / 15,097 = 2.91
The estimated amount of vapor to the condenser = 44,000 / 4 = 11,000 lb/h
Finally, the cooling water requirements at the condenser, W subscript c =
11,000 [1,022+ 1 (122 - 117)] / (117 - 70) = 240,362 lb/h

The payback time
The costs for the for the triple-effect versus the quadruple-effect
evaporator are given in the Table on p. 124. By comparing the numbers, one
can see that the total annual costs for a quadruple effect system are lower
than for a unit with three effects. This makes it economically attractive
to increase the number of effects.
   The difference in investment = 61,311 - 46,811 = $14,500
   The difference in costs = 452,713 - 355,314 = $97,399/yr
   The payback period = 14,500 / 97,399 = 0.14 years.
   This confirms that it economically advantageous to install a quadruple
effect in the evaporator.

SHARING REAL-TIME PLANT INFORMATION
Engineers, analysts and managers make better business and technology
decisions with access to timely process data

By:
Edited by Suzanne Shelley

At any petroleum refinery, developing process improvements and solving
production problems requires access to accurate and timely operating
information, including tank field data, laboratory results and furnace
efficiency. By installing a state-of-the-art data acquisition and
presentation system, the Chevron Refinery at Pascagoula, Miss., now makes
real-time process data widely available to managers and engineers
throughout the facility.
   Historically, Chevron engineers responsible for process improvements and
troubleshooting would go to a control room and gather reams of paper from
stripchart recorders and data loggers. They would study the tracings and
numbers on these paper strips and enter the data into calculators and
computer programs for detailed analysis. Not only was data gathering labor
intensive, but the refinery operated a number of private computer systems,
which meant that engineers and managers only had access to information that
was generated within their own divisions.
   With the advent of a microprocessor-based distributed control system
(DCS) at the Pascagoula facility, an automated, paperless data acquisition
system became possible. To gather all its real-time operating and
process-monitoring data using one centralized system, Chevron first
replaced all its discrete process monitoring systems with InfoPlus from
Setpoint, Inc. (Houston, Tex.). At the same time, the firm selected Setcim,
another product from Setpoint, to automate information management at its
tank field and laboratories. InfoPlus and Setcim are fully compatible with
one another and are easily networked together using the same graphic
console system.

Power at your fingertips
This new, integrated information monitoring and management system provides
operators with a clearer picture of refinery operations. For example, one
can create a single graph that shows the current operating efficiency,
excess oxygen, and target values for all furnaces in the refinery. This
allows problems to be identified and corrected well before they incur
shutdown or significant repair costs.
   Equipment engineers have successfully used the networked system to
identify and correct untimely equipment failures and recurring mechanical
problems. Researchers at remote locations also have ready access to
operating data, allowing them to target their process-improvement studies
to actual refinery conditions.
   Another important application provides an interface between the
laboratory information-management system and the plant information system.
   This makes it easy to combine lab and process data, and display them
graphically, to make correlations.
   Tank field management has also improved. Setcim's real-time database 
calculates the volume in each tank and tracks materials moving from ships
to tanks, transfers between tanks, and discharges from tanks to process
units. All this material-transfer information is also uploaded to the
accounting system, which makes inventory management more timely and
accurate. And, while the system provides immediate access to process and
inventory data from virtually any location in the refinery or corporation
-- it requires only three people to support it.

A networked hierarchy
The compatible Setcim and InfoPlus systems are a hierarchy of networked
systems. The bottom layer manages short-term, local operating data from six
individual process units, and maintains 24-h data averages for a period of
one year. This layer is designed to help operators and production
supervisors manage and control the day-to-day refinery operations.
   The top, or public, layer of the information management system gathers
information from the process unit system and makes it available to
selected consoles and individuals throughout the refinery, as well as to
corporate offices worldwide. This top layer updates more than 30,000 data
points once every minute. The graphics system is a client-server system.
With graphics tasks handled on the client workstation, network traffic and
server loading are minimized, substantially improving response time.

BRINGING AUTOMATION TO VISCOSITY MEASUREMENT
By combining a differential viscometer with robotic sample preparation, one
polymer lab increased throughput by 300%

By:
Edited by Suzanne Shelley


During polymer production, inherent viscosity (IV) is an important quality
and process control parameter. Determined by measuring the viscosity of a
dilute solution of the polymer in a solvent, IV reflects the molecular
weight of the polymer, and the material's ability to be processed for
different applications.
  At Tennessee Eastman's Polymer Division in Kingsport, Tenn., IV is
measured at least every 2-4 hours on samples taken from each polymer
production line, and from every shipment. When increased production began
to tax the laboratory's capacity, the company elected to automate its
viscosity measurement system.
  Since investing in several differential viscometers from Viscotek Corp.
(Houston, Tex.) for more rapid viscosity measurement, and a robotic system
from Zymark Corp. (Hopkinton, Mass). to weigh, dilute and load samples,
Tennessee Eastman has more than doubled its analysis capacity -- and has
simultaneously reduced the amount of laboratory labor required.
  Until 1986, the lab measured viscosity using a glass capillary
viscometer. A technician manually weighed and diluted a polymer sample and
placed the solution in the capillary tube. Photoelectric detectors measured
the time required for the polymer solution to flow by gravity between two
marks on the tube. The technician then calculated IV based on the flow time
through the viscometer.
  After analysis, the capillary was manually rinsed with solvent and
refilled. Using two full-time technicians, the lab was able to measure
60-90 samples during a typical 12-h shift.

Growing lab demands
As production capacity at the Tennessee Eastman facility grew, so did its
analytical requirements. Instead of adding technicians, equipment and lab
space, the firm replaced the 12 capillary viscometers with two Model 100
differential viscometers from Viscotek. Operating 24 h/d, 365 d/yr, each
differential viscometer processes a sample five times as fast as one of
the capillary tubes previously used.
  The differential viscometers operate on the same principle as a
Wheatstone bridge: Polymer solution flows through one side of the bridge,
while pure solvent flows through the other. Pressure transducers measure
the differential pressure and inlet pressure across the bridge. The
transducer output is then transmitted to a personal computer, which
calculates IV based on the pressure data and the polymer concentration in
the solvent.
  Tennessee Eastman also installed robots to prepare samples for the
differential viscometers. Now, a robot picks up the sample, weighs it,
places it in a clean dissolution tube, adds enough solvent to make the
required for a 0.5 vol.% polymer solution, and then transfers the tube to a
heating block to dissolve the polymer. The robot then puts the tube on a
cooling rack before extracting a sample to fill a sample injection loop for
the differential viscometer.
  With this level of automation, the lab now measures the IV of 325-425
samples per shift, and has the capacity to handle up to 450 samples per
shift. This increase has been accomplished with a staff reduction of half a
person.
  The technicians now operating the lab focus on supporting the viscometers
and robots. They load samples, clean glassware, proof analytical results
before the computer sends them to production, and perform weekly preventive
maintenance cleaning.
  They may also operate a manual differential viscometer when the automatic
systems are down for routine maintenance, or during the analysis of
polymers that contain fillers that could plug the capillaries in the
bridge.
  In the seven years since the Tennessee Eastman's Polymer Division 
switched to automated viscometers and robotics, the units have required
minimal maintenance and downtime. And, since the facility stocks its own
spare lab parts, it can correct most problems within minutes.

hazardous solvents

LEACH POTASH FROM MINERALS USING COLD CRYSTALLIZATION
Operating at ambient temperatures, this system yields 98% pure potash 
without steam or cooling water

By:
Edited by Suzanne Shelley

The mineral carnallite (KClMgCl2 6H20), a naturally occurring evaporite
deposit found in ancient seas, is a major source of potash (KCl) for the
world fertilizer market. The potash is typically separated from carnallite
by crystallization, using an energy-intensive, hot leach process.
   Using the conventional approach, the carnallite is dissolved in a hot
aqueous solution, which is saturated with respect to NaCl but unsaturated
with respect to MgCl2 and KCl. As additional carnallite is added, the
solution becomes saturated with KCl. As the hot, saturated solution is
cooled, KCl crystals precipitate. While effective, the conventional process
requires large amounts of steam, water, and electrical energy for heating,
cooling and pumping.
   In 1994, after a three-year pilot program, the Arab Potash Co. (Safi,
Jordan) began to use a full-scale, cold crystallization system provided by
Swenson Process Equipment, Inc. (Harvey, Ill.) at its 400,000-m.t./yr
potash plant. Designed to decompose carnallite from the Dead Sea, the
system consists of only two 55-ft dia. crystallizers, which operate at
ambient temperature.
   Since startup in late 1994, the plant has been producing high-purity
potash at or above design capacity, with no steam consumption. By
comparison, the hot-leach process requires 266,000 kcal of steam heat per
m.t. potash. Similarly, the cold process requires no cooling water, while
the hot process requires 6.5 m3 of cooling water per m.t. of potash. And,
using just 11 kWh electricity per m.t. of potash, the cold process has half
the power requirements of the conventional hot-leach process.

Harvesting the ocean's bounty
The evaporite carnallite is composed of a 1:1 molar ratio of KCl and MgCl,
with six water molecules. It is almost always contaminated with other
salts, particularly sodium chloride. To produce pure potash from
carnallite, the evaporite mineral is decomposed with water, so that the
pure potash can be crystallized, and a brine containing MgCl2, NaCl and
other salts can be rejected.
   In the Swenson cold process, carnallite solids are brought by conveyor
to the top of a crystallizer and dispersed into a circulating slurry of
crystals and mother liquor. As the carnallite crystals enter the slurry,
they are surrounded by growing crystals of KCl, which act as a sponge,
absorbing the supersaturated KCl that is created by the ongoing
decomposition of the carnallite.
   In the Swenson draft-tube-baffle crystallizer, a large, slow-moving
propeller enclosed by a draft tube directs the circulation of crystals and
near-saturated MgCl2 mother liquor to the surface within the vessel. The
baffle surrounding the draft tube defines the crystallizing volume.
   Surrounding the baffle is a large settling zone, where the mother liquor
that contains only the finer fractions of the crystalline material is
removed. This mother liquor is mixed with water to ensure complete
dissolution of any residual fine crystals. This maintains the required
material balance, ensuring optimal decomposition of the carnallite feed.
From a separate zone in the settling area, another stream of mother liquor
-- this one containing MgCl2 -- is removed to maintain the overall material
balance in the system.
   Strong demand for fertilizers and other mineral-derived products,
combined with the growing cost of energy worldwide, encourages the use of
low-energy technologies. Since late 1994, the cold crystallization system
at Arab Potash has been making 98%-pure KCl at or above the system's
400,000-m.t./yr design capacity. Similar cold crystallization systems are
being used elsewhere to cost-effectively produce purified crystals from
mineral products.

CLEAR AWAY THE PAPER BLIZZARD
Electronic Document Management (EDM) simplifies recordkeeping

By:
NICHOLAS BASTA

Question: When is a computer file not a file? Answer: When it is a
``document'' in a document-management system.
   That paradoxical statement doesn't refer so much to the format or data
structure of a computer file, but rather to what purpose it is being put.
When originally created, a text file, CAD drawing or maintenance workers'
job ticket is usually printed on paper, carried about by involved workers,
then ultimately stored in a file cabinet. Days, months or years later,
there may be a pressing need to look at the stored information, but very
often it is misplaced, forgotten or, because of the language and format in
which the electronic version was created, unreadable by current equipment.
   Enter a solution, variously called electronic, engineering, technical or
product document management. The goal of electronic document management
(EDM) is to capture all written information (and, in the more advanced
systems, graphics and video information as well) in a form that can be
stored safely and retrieved with minimum effort. Thus, the answer to the
trick question above is that, once stored in an ordered, retrievable
manner, a computer file has been transformed into an electronic
``document.''
   Usually, the data are stored in an electronic ``vault,'' a computer
system with copious amounts of disk space, and a database management system
(DBMS) that records the information type and location. The scope of the EDM
system can range from a small electronic file manager that tracks all
versions of some project, to comprehensive, enterprise-wide systems. These
large systems have optical character-recognition programs to translate
paper text into computer files, along with indexing functions to
automatically store the files by topic.
   Throughout business and manufacturing, EDM systems are being applied not
only to keep the institutional memory in place, but also as a technique to
speed up design of new products and meet competitive pressures. (Thus, the
one flavor of EDM called product document management -- PDM -- for the
creation of, say, a new automobile.)

A trio of objectives
In the context of the CPI, the three most important goals that EDM systems
address are ISO 9000 certification, safety-recordkeeping requirements of
the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and, for
pharmaceutical manufacturers, the validation procedures of the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
   Properly applied, the same EDM system can provide compliance with all
three goals. However, it is not unheard of for a company to have one system
installed for FDA requirements, and another for OSHA.
   EDM is caught up today in the whirlwind of advances occurring in both
hardware and software. On the hardware side, companies are investing in the
latest generations of optical storage technology, which swallows gigabytes
of data at a mouthful, and advanced networking tools, such as wide-area
telecommunications and networking, including Internet servers. On the
software side, EDM partakes of the shift toward object-oriented programming
(OOP) that characterizes the latest database and CAD programs.
   In fact, there is a blurring together of the CAD software business with
that of EDM. CAD vendors consider themselves the front end of the EDM
business, in that preliminary and detailed design drawings are usually
created by CAD packages. If there is software available to combine reports,
notes and letters with the drawings, the basic elements of an EDM system
are in place.
   One company that positioned itself as much as a data manager as a CAD
supplier is EA Systems (Alameda, Calif.), which markets the Pasce (Plant
Applications for Concurrent Engineering) program. The system is notable for
using the same database structure for 2D as for 3D design files.
   Over the past couple years, it has forged links with most of the other
major CAD vendors, so that users of those programs can still take advantage
of the data-storage capabilities of Pasce. Interfaces have also been
successfully written for a number of commercial EDM programs, says Marie
Telepneff, marketing manager for EA.
   Those big CAD companies, though, are coming out with EDM systems as
extensions of their CAD franchise. Intergraph Corp. (Huntsville, Ala.)
introduced a small-scaled program that ran under Microsoft Windows,
DM/Librarian, in 1994, then followed in 1995 with a full-blown system
called DM2.
   DM2 has nine modules, including ones called Manager, Server and
Workflow. These three, which build on each other, allow the user to set up
the basic DBMS (including a client-server architecture that runs on many
different Unix and Windows platforms) and manage how data are entered and
retrieved. DM/Workflow helps managers set up and monitor the progress of a
project through its phases.
   EDM gives the CPI better access to design information needed over the
life cycle of a plant. ``Plant owners work with a design-construction
company for five years to build a facility, but then run that facility for
decades,'' notes Tommy Steele, president of Intergraph Software Solutions,
one of the company's divisions. ``They want to be able to use all the
documents that were created during the life of the facility.''
   Bentley Systems, Inc. (Exton, Pa.) also announced an EDM product last
year: TeamMate, the rights to which it acquired from Opti Inter-Consult, a
Finnish EDM company. The product works directly with MicroStation,
Bentley's flagship CAD product, and can be customized to handle most types
of computer files.
   Bentley emphasizes the workflow management aspects of TeamMate. The
creation of, access to, and changes within a document can all be tracked by
the program. An audit trail, in which every change in the document is
recorded, is also generated.

In the PC arena
Both Bentley's and Intergraph's products, now available in versions that
can run on PCs, originally were designed for more powerful, Unix-based
workstation computers. One CAD product that has been PC-based from the
start is AutoCad, from AutoDesk, Inc. (Sausalito, Calif.), which works with
a variety of third parties to produce industry-specific packages.
   One of the more prominent of these third parties is Rebis (Walnut
Creek, Calif.), whose AutoPlant programs tailor AutoCad to the needs of the
CPI. Rebis now offers PlantLIFE, a data-management system to track design
files, match them with other documents such as operating procedures, and
provide an audit trail of revisions.
   PlantLIFE doesn't need AutoCAD to view drawings or other documents, so
users not running the CAD package can still work with it. Rebis says that
the program has features that make it especially useful for compliance with
the OSHA 1910 regulation, which requires up-to-date documentation of
process equipment and procedures. OSHA 1910 also has a ``management of
change'' provision that makes a critical issue of revisions to existing
documents or procedures.
   Most recently, Rebis announced that it would develop a version of its
family of products that are compatible with Bentley's MicroStation. The
conversion is made feasible by the plans of both Autodesk and Bentley to
use OOP in their newer generations of products.
   Computervision Inc. (Bedford, Mass.), one of the leading PDM firms, has
developed a comprehensive data-management system that has interfaces to
both its CAD products (Cadds, Medusa and others) and those of most
competitors. Called Optegra, the system has workflow and data-management
components, as well as a ``configuration master,'' which allows users to
assemble drawings, bills of materials and other information into a unified
whole that can be accessed directly.

Moving paper
CAD vendors are by no means the only players in the EDM arena. A large
number of other companies, whose sole reason for existence is EDM, are also
important in the field. These companies generally have not had strong
experience in the process manufacturing arena, but, when paired with other
partners, can provide appropriate technical solutions.
   Documentum, Inc. (Pleasanton, Calif.), for example, has paired up with
Consilium Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.) to market Enterprise Document
Management System (EDMS) for process manufacturers, especially in the
pharmaceutical industry. Consilium, a supplier of manufacturing execution
software, sees the combination of its plant-floor datagathering and EDMS's
document storage as powerful tools for cutting time-to-market delays. FDA
regulations, for example, take an enormous amount of records to validate
not only what processes are used to make drugs, but even what equipment is
used, and how closely test results are matched with production parameters.
   At the New York Chem Show (Dec. 2-4), Foxboro Co. (Foxboro, Mass.)
announced an alliance with Documentum, whereby EDMS is embedded in
Foxboro's I/AS distributed control system. ``The system works at the
operators' level, where they can retrieve safety data sheets, operating
procedures and the like from their workstation,'' says Harry Forbes, a
Foxboro marketing manager.
   Another matchup combines IBM's computer and networking prowess with that
of NovaSoft Systems, Inc. (Burlington, Mass. 630), which markets NovaManage
EDM software. While managing both workflow and documentation functions,
NovaManage has an intuitive interface that allows memory-challenged users
to search for records on the basis of ``looks like'' or ``sounds like''
criteria. Documents are automatically time-stamped when created or stored.
The latest version, 6.2, features a ``cellular document'' approach that
allows departmental managers to customize the enterprise-wide system to
local requirements.
   A newcomer to the EDM field is VirtualPlant, from The Simplex Group,
Inc. (Pittsburgh, Pa.). The program allows users both to produce drawings
of existing plant equipment, using simple layout tools, and to link
documents, procedures and other relevant information to the diagrams. A
library of standard objects is included.
   The U.K. brings its expertise to the EDM field via Cimage Enterprise
Systems (Bracknell, Berkshire, England), which has just released version
1.0 of Document Manager API, a library of application programming
interfaces for various Microsoft products. The system is designed to work
simply as another open window during a Windows session, with users pulling
down menus to make entries. The program can operate as a server in a LAN or
wide-area network (WAN), and can handle scanned documents, CAD drawings and
common Windows business applications. Cimage is represented in the U.S. by
Access Corp. (Cincinnati, Ohio).
   Various studies cite the statistic that engineers spend 40 to 75% of
their time looking for data and documents, thus drastically cutting into
their active work time. EDM systems offer to cut that time considerably, or
at least make the search a less frustrating task.
   Will file cabinets and other storage compartments for records become a
thing of the past? Probably not, but at least the paper blizzard will be
brought under control, leaving engineers more time to meet their
obligations.
