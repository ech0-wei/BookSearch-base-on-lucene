'94 CTD cases continue trend, jump 10 percent
CTDs as a percent of all injuries and illnesses also increase.


Cumulative trauma disorders continued to ravage U.S. workplaces by
growing 10 percent in 1994, refuting predictions by private industry
that CTDs would slow or decrease.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in December "repeated
trauma" cases logged by private industry in 1994 totaled 332,000, up
from 302,400 in 1993. The BLS numbers are collected from the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration 200 logs, which employers
are required to complete when an injured or ill worker requires more
than cursory medical treatment.
Not only did the number of repeated trauma cases increase, but so did
their percentage of the overall injury and illnesses recorded by U.S.
business. CTDs now account for about 5 percent of the nation's 6.8
million nonfatal injuries and illnesses in 1994, up from 4.5 percent in
1993.
George Brogmus of Liberty Mutual Research Center for Safety and Health
had predicted the rate of increase for workplace CTDs would slow down or
decrease. His findings were based on Liberty Mutual numbers and BLS
statistics showing the CTD claims and CTDs cases as a percent of all
claims and cases.
"They aren't in the same pattern I reported," said Brogmus. "However,
the growth rate (the change from one year to the next) is still not as
high as it has been in previous years." 
Three-fifths of all the new repeated trauma cases come from the
manufacturing sector, according to the Survey of Occupational Injuries
and Illnesses, 1994. Meatpacking and knit underwear plants recorded the
highest incidence rates while motor vehicles and car bodies and poultry
slaughtering and processing logged the most repeated trauma cases.
(The incidence rate represents the number of injuries and illnesses per
100 full-time employees times 200,000.)  
Repeated trauma also accounted for nearly two-thirds of the workplace
illnesses. Skin diseases and disorders ranked second with 13 percent.
"We are gravely concerned about the growing number of new cases,"  said
Cheryl Bryne, OSHA's spokesperson. She would not speculate on what the
new numbers meant to the agency's attempt to produce an ergo standard.
Congressional conservatives have stymied attempts by OSHA to publish and
conduct research on a proposed ergonomics standard. This effort has been
part of an overall antiregulatory agenda that has been successful in the
House but mixed in the Senate.
In the spring, the BLS will release survey results detailing the
worker's occupation, nature of the injury or illness and how the injury
or illness happened.

Big, small firms show how ergo programs make cents
2nd 'Best Practices' issue stresses cost savings, CTD cuts


Now, more than ever, the efficacy of ergonomics and ergonomics programs
is being scrutinized by company presidents and financial officers.
Ergonomics efforts not showing measurable savings often are frozen or
cut.
As a result, practical information detailing ergonomics interventions,
costs and savings continues to be a commodity in high demand and the
basis for CTDNews' 2nd Annual Best Practices issue.
Once again, we chose the featured companies after surveying U.S. and
Canadian corporations, ergonomics consultants, labor organizations and
health and safety associations and researchers.
This year, CTDNews' ergonomics honor roll includes Ford Motor Co. of
Dearborn, MI; Charleston Forge of Boone, NC; Holloman Air Force Base
near Alamogordo, NM; and Avenor Inc. of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.
The variety of problems addressed and savings realized should be useful
for an equal variety of businesses. Through these four companies, the
value of formalized ergonomics programs to homemade quick fixes
illustrates the impact of ergonomics on the workplace.
Each of these companies agreed to provide information about the genesis
of its ergonomics programs and the pitfalls they encountered while
implementing and maintaining the program. They also volunteered some
details on the health and safety costs of doing business.
While the thirst for program costs and savings is great, many companies
generally do not provide complete financial information for many
reasons, including fears that some details could be used against them in
workers' compensation lawsuits or that it would give their competitors
an advantage in the marketplace.
In any case, company officials quoted have agreed to share their
experiences and results with anyone interested in more information.
Telephone numbers are provided.

California expects heated debate over new ergo rule


Although the newly proposed California ergonomics standard is only 1 1/2
pages, there apparently is plenty to talk about as state officials
prepare for two public hearings later this month.
This is the second attempt at a standard since the state Occupational
Safety and Health Standards Board unanimously turned down Cal/OSHA's
proposal in November 1994. 
The new proposal would take effect when a musculoskeletal injury to more
than one employee has been "diagnosed and objectively identified" within
the last 12 months. Worksite evaluations, hazard control and training
are included in an ergonomics program.
The proposal also includes three simplified worksheets to assist in the
program's development.
Scaled down from the original 26-page proposal, the Standards Board's
effort will impact about 14,000 businesses. No financial impact was
given since "costs can vary widely and are dependent on the steps that
have already been taken to reduce repetitive motion injuries."
Public hearings for the first proposal drew more than 1,000 comments and
public demonstrations by organized labor. 
Hearings are scheduled for Jan. 18 at 9 a.m. at the Airport Marina
Resort Hotel in Los Angeles and Jan. 23 at 9 a.m. at the Sacramento
Convention Center.
-  For more about the hearings or proposal, contact the OSH Standards
Board at 916-322-3640.

Charleston Forge welds homemade approach


Charleston Forge doesn't have a textbook ergonomics program. However,
its approach works in reducing cumulative trauma disorders and in
increasing worker productivity without sacrificing the company's
finances.
By conducting basic workstation surveillance and consulting with local
medical and physical therapy experts, the manufacturer of decorative
home and office steel furniture dramatically reduced ergonomic-related
injuries  --  and increased workers' productivity and efficiency.
The firm's lost days from carpal tunnel syndrome, back strain and other
CTDs have been cut to zero this year, down from as many 176 lost
workdays in 1991.
"Some of the fixes, specifically equipment purchases, have been very
high dollar," said Jo Spiceland, Charleston Forge's human resources
director and safety and environmental compliance officer. "But, we
didn't make the changes just for ergonomics reasons. Increased
productivity played a major role."
Spiceland said the company's productivity increased by about 25 percent
in three years.
Charleston Forge of Boone, NC, employs about 150 people and is located
about 85 miles west of Winston-Salem. 
In manufacturing steel furniture, employees must carry, shape and cut
20-foot lengths of steel in various shapes and sizes, weld the pieces
into products and pull or carry the finished products that weigh as much
as 150 pounds to finishing, painting and the shipping area.

Carpal tunnel main CTD

Because of the fine and repetitive handwork involved in many of the
plant's jobs, Spiceland said carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis had
become serious problems. "The company's owner saw the inefficiencies of
the old (manufacturing) system and knew about the carpal tunnel problems
we were having.
"So the decision to make changes wasn't difficult," continued Spiceland.
"Also, money has not been a big roadblock due to the success of the
company. We knew we had to improve the process to decrease CTDs and to
increase productivity."
In addition, many workers throughout the plants have suffered back
strains from handling the products.
The problem-solving approach in the early 1990s included encouraging the
"buddy system," according to Spiceland. Employees were told not to lift
anything beyond their capability. Limited job rotation was used. The
company also provided back belts to interested employees, conditional
upon the worker attending a seminar on proper body mechanics and lifting
techniques. Spiceland said back belts are rarely used now.
With cases of CTDs and lost workdays due to CTDs failing to decline,
Charleston Forge enlisted the help of a local physical therapist and
loss-control representatives from the company's workers' compensation
insurance carrier. After several walk-through visits, they recommended
fixes for specific jobs.

Changes start in 1993

"In 1993, we began to make specific fixes, without really forming a
formal program," said Spiceland, who spends only about 10 percent of her
time addressing ergonomics concerns. "We were a small company with
managers wearing many hats. A formal program will come, but there
haven't been the human resources or time available to devote to it yet."
Spiceland said her knowledge of job evaluation came from seminars and
from becoming familiar with OSHA's proposed ergonomics standard.
The finishing area was one of the first to be fixed. For example, once a
baker's shelf made of steel has been welded together, employees with
pneumatic wire brushes removed burn marks and welding splashes and then
washed the product. At one point, 25 people spent eight hours a day
wire-brushing and washing them.
The risk of carpal tunnel and tendinitis has since been eliminated by
automating the process through the purchase of an enclosed shotblaster
machine, which is similar to a sand blaster, to polish the steel. The
company also purchased an automatic washing system. Now, only three
people spend two hours a day brushing. Exposures to carpal tunnel
syndrome and back injuries (from awkward postures) were greatly reduced.
Also, in this and other areas in the plant, improved lighting placement
and brightness has decreased many of the awkward postures required to
inspect and brush the products. These combined to greatly reduce
exposures to CTS and back injuries.
Spiceland said automating this part of the process did not cause the
company to lay off anyone. Instead, these employees now operate the
washing and shotblaster machines or work in other departments.
The consulting physical therapist also targeted the welding operation.
Employees placed parts in a fixed jig or template for each of the
company's products. Many workers had to stretch, turn and assume awkward
positions to place all the parts into the jig and then remove them after
welding.
As a result, Charleston Forge made many of the jigs adjustable. Some
tilt to make the product easier to remove. This change reduced many of
the back problems for the company's 20 welders. Even though workers use
a handheld welder, Spiceland says it has not posed any problems because
it is light and without vibration.
"The welders were purchased before we had a real awareness of CTDs. We
were just fortunate that the welders had these features," Spiceland
said.
Ergonomic changes, aside from the shotblaster and washing systems, have
cost the company about $3,500. This includes the training and purchase
of back belts and labor and materials for jig adjustments and lighting
improvements.

Problems still present

While the company has made significant gains in many areas, others such
as packaging and moving the product out the door still pose challenges.
The product is pulled along the floor to several stations by hand. There
are no wheels on any of the products. 
Currently, employees lift the products into cardboard boxes and those
boxes are then moved to trucks by way of hand trucks.
The physical therapists and physicians, who provided their ergonomics
consultations free of charge, have recommended the company buy hoists to
eliminate the problem. But, Spiceland said, the cost for hoists is
prohibitive because of the large area involved.
Instead, they're trying a less costly approach. "We tried a
propane-powered shrink wrap system that would have reduced the amount of
lifting involved in packing our products. However, the results were
disappointing.
"Shrink wrapping slowed our packaging time from about 1 1/2 minutes per
item to almost seven minutes," Spiceland said. "We're experimenting with
other interventions now."
Spiceland said the company also has the capabilities to make a lot of
tooling, and tends to look to homemade solutions.

Informal problem solving

She uses an informal team approach to resolving problem jobs.
Spiceland, an engineer, the employees and supervisor put their heads
together when the need arises to come up with the interventions.
Charleston Forge's approach is even more unique because employees
undergo almost no ergonomics training. But, Spiceland admitted, when the
company added another shift in 1994 and hired about 40 new workers, "We
learned the hard way that we didn't do enough training and supervision,
and we're paying for it in workers' compensation premiums."
The company is developing a thorough training program for supervisors
and employees of which ergonomics and basic safety will be major
components.
For small companies wanting to encourage a healthier and more productive
workforce, Spiceland strongly recommends developing a working
relationship with local health professionals and utilizing their
expertise. 
Because the physical therapists and physicians were local health
professionals, they already were aware of Charleston Forge. Their
services had been used numerous times to treat workers' compensation
injuries.
"I simply asked them if they could help us reduce our CTD risk. I didn't
really ask for anything beyond specific interventions," said Spiceland.
"When I approached our local health professionals, they were eager to
share their knowledge and experience to improve our workers' health and
comfort," she said.

Ford: Where quality, ergonomics combine
Automaker's program suited for even small,financially strapped companies


There's a recurring theme in the occupational safety and health
community: larger companies  --  like Ford Motor Co.  --  are more successful
at eliminating workplace CTDs than many smaller companies with limited
resources.
With billions in resources, unfortunately, "bigger doesn't mean better,"
according to Bradley S. Joseph, Ph.D., a Ford corporate ergonomist. 
"As a practice, we cannot throw resources and people at a problem. We
believe in transferring technology and information to people who can use
it best. Smaller companies can do the same," said Joseph, whose company
has spent about $35 million in industrial ergonomics interventions in 60
manufacturing and assembly plants since 1990.
Despite what Ford is spending on ergonomics interventions, the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics reports motor vehicles, car bodies and
vehicle part and accessories record the most "repetitive trauma" cases.
Instead, Ford's size requires considerable advanced preparation for a
standardized ergonomics program for all of its U.S., Canadian and
Mexican plants. This strategy   --  including devoting considerable
resources to planning and recordkeeping  --  has its long-term rewards.

Commitment the key

"Much of an ergonomics program's success is based on the plant's
commitment  --  everyone from the plant manager down to hourly workers,"
said Joseph. "Without the time and effort to determine who you are and
what you want to do, the results cannot be as good."
By that, Joseph means securing the support of management and labor to
ensure the ergonomics program's and committee's legitimacy. If the top
officials from both sides cannot be full-time committee members, then
invite them to all meetings, ask for their help and let them be the
first to hear about successes.
Beyond the management and labor commitment, Joseph emphasized the
importance of making the ergonomics process inclusive and plantwide.
"A program is likely to be more successful if the ergonomics process is
a team effort. Don't outsource (the ergonomics decision making) to third
parties like consultants or put it into the hands of a plant ergonomist
only. This focuses the responsibility on an individual, not a team,"
said Joseph.
But what about the small company that doesn't have the expertise or
money to hire an ergonomist to help with the program?
"Some of the best programs are run by people without traditional, formal
ergonomics and health and safety knowledge. They know  --  better than me  -- 
how the plant works," Joseph said. "But they do need training, knowledge
of ergonomics and to know when to seek help." 
Ford's ergonomics process, developed by the United Auto Workers-Ford
National Joint Committee of Health and Safety and the University of
Michigan, recommends an ergonomics committee of eight people  --  four each
from labor and management. These members receive basic training in
ergonomics principles, techniques for job evaluation, recordkeeping and
monitoring and refining the process.
Once assembled, the committee members must write a mission statement to
ensure each member understands the goal(s) and has the same purpose. In
addition, the ergonomics process guide also recommends committee members
be released from regular assignments to attend ergonomics committee
meetings and accomplish tasks. There should be meeting agendas and
minutes to emphasize the work's importance.
(See "Making the mission possible" on this page for key elements to a
mission statement.)

Not just costs

"Money is very important for plant operations. Cost-benefit analysis
must be used to justify changes," said Joseph. "Ergonomics can be
implemented using traditional cost benefits. But you have to balance it
with the social aspects of health and safety and what's correct to do."
On average, the committee solves 20-30 ergonomics problems a year. Of
the 60 plants the company currently is tracking, about 7,200
ergonomics-related problems have been fixed since 1990  --  1,067 between
January and June 1995.   
Standardized recordkeeping includes detailed ergonomics concerns logs,
intervention tracking and follow-up worksheets. Joseph said, "We don't
want one plant to differ greatly from another even though they are
hundreds of miles apart."
(See examples of Ford's worksheets)
"That way if one Taurus assembly plant is having a workstation problem
on the assembly line, they could check with another Taurus plant to see
if its ergonomics concern logs showed a similar problem and how it was
resolved," continued Joseph.
 Ford's preparation is illustrated best at its new Cleveland engine
plant. Eighteen months ago, the company finished rebuilding an engine
assembly plant designed with ergonomics in mind.
For example, the local committee designed machine tools to allow easy
access to metal cutting blades. Articulating arms were added when the
machines were designed to eliminate exposure to extended reaches and
back and shoulder stress.
Another example was installing a roller conveyor system to bring parts
closer to operators. The new system eliminated lifting and carrying of
parts.
To date, there have been no ergonomics-related injuries. The local
ergonomics committee has responded to four concerns logged in the first
six months of 1995 and spent about $17,000.

Benefits of proactive changes

Compare those numbers to Ford's other Cleveland engine plant, where
changes have been made to the existing assembly processes. The logs show
seven concerns, costing about $200,000 over the same time period. This
shows how much more cost effective it is to make change during the
planning stages.
Although the company has dramatically reduced its cost for ergonomics
intervention in the modern plant by being proactive, problems still
exist. Joseph said the local ergonomics committee is responding to them.
The committee is examining how workers install spark plug and
distributor wires. Workers are exposed to repetitive, high-force pinches
with awkward wrist postures. The company has joined forces with the
University of South Florida to resolve the problem. 
But few companies have the wherewithal to gut factories and redesign
manufacturing processes. For those, Ford often has relied on homemade
solutions. In the Sharonville Transmission Plant in Sharonville, OH,
employees were having to carry a 35-pound clutch about 10 steps to the
assembly line and insert it into the transmission housing. They also
were required to walk back to parts bins and pick up several other
components to be installed in the housing.
Outside equipment vendors recommended hoists or articulating arms, but
because the clutch mechanism easily separated, it really had to be
installed by hand.

Homemade remedy

As a result, the local ergonomics committee developed a portable
workstation on wheels that would carry all the parts  --  for more than one
transmission  --  on a tray with rollers and Lazy Susans. The workers then
would bring all the transmission components to the assembly line and
avoid the repetitive lifting and walking back and forth.
The company also has utilized plastic part kits in the assembly process
to reduce excessive reaching, bending and turning. At Ford's Van Dyke
Plant in Sterling Heights, MI, transmissions move through some of the
assembly process on a pallet with these plastic kits  --  which hold about
20 parts  --  atop the assembly fixture. The kits are made of molded
plastic so each part is separated  --  like the plastic packing in a
multipart child's toy  --  and easy to reach. Workers no longer turn around
and reach for parts in bins behind them.
In addition, to make the assembly process more comfortable, the assembly
line was raised about nine inches and a composite floor of recycled
tires was installed to provide cushion and relieve strain and stress on
the back.
At some Ford plants, the decision to change a job depends on analysis of
existing data, informal reports from workers or proactive
identification. For example, workers' compensation costs and lost work
time are calculated for specific health hazards and then multiplied by
four to cover any hidden costs.
"Many times, that number is more than the cost of the change and is
approved," said Joseph. "Other changes are harder to justify and other
methods of analysis or justification may be required."
Ford's accomplishments are attributed to the partnership between labor
and management and the preparation and experience of the local
ergonomics committee, according to Joseph.
The keys to building a similar process are not proprietary information.
Indeed, Joseph said, "There's no need for other companies  --  big or small
 --  to try and reinvent the wheel."

Holloman's effort defies expectations


Defying a perception that the federal government can do nothing
inexpensively, Holloman Air Force Base has successfully implemented
ergonomics changes on a shoestring budget.
The changes, instituted over two years, dramatically cut the number of
CTD-related injuries through assessments, job modifications, some new
equipment and training.
"The administrative and engineering changes represent the 'gold
standard' OSHA was looking for," said Major Alan Berg, commander of the
49th Aerospace Medicine Squadron and base ergonomics manager. "We got
rid of our injuries and showed that the civilian industry doesn't have
to worry quite as much" about the prospects of an ergonomics standard.
The improvements started after Holloman Air Force Base, near Alamogordo,
NM, was inspected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
in August 1992. An employee reported the base to OSHA. Four months
later, Berg and the base received a 22-page citation under the general
duty clause and an order to fix a variety of ergonomic hazards within
one year.
The base employs over 6,000 military and civilian personnel in support
of the F-117A "Stealth" aircraft and associated training requirements.
The shop inspected by OSHA performs survival equipment maintenance,
sewing operations and parachute packing. Parachutes were either for
personnel, aircraft braking systems (drag chutes) or heavy equipment
(drone chutes), which can be up to 120 feet in diameter and weigh over
150 pounds.
In the parachute shop, OSHA noted ergonomics hazards related to
inadequate lighting, poorly designed workstations and awkward, forceful
body positioning affecting the back and arms. Specifically, OSHA focused
on tasks that required excessive lifting, bending and repetitive arm
motions.
"Over a four-year period (1990-1993), we had 15 people with confirmed
CTD cases. And the shop employs only 25," said Berg. "These were not
weak or small people. At one point (spring of 1993), 11 out of 19 people
were on limited duty because they couldn't do the more stressful jobs."
But more than just fixing the one shop that OSHA had inspected, Berg
wanted to be proactive and develop a program that would address
ergonomic stresses throughout the base.
"To address all those problems and set up a base-wide ergonomics
program, I needed more than a year," Berg told CTDNews. "OSHA agreed to
postpone the deadline so long as the base was pursuing a comprehensive
ergonomics program."

Where to find help

Without a national ergonomics standard, Berg found the assistance and
direction to create an ergonomics program from OSHA's "Guidelines for
Establishing Ergonomics Programs in Meatpacking Plants." "I had no
problem convincing my superiors that we needed to make changes," Berg
quipped. "I just used the four-letter word, O-S-H-A."  
Seriously, he added, "When I showed them the impact of ergonomic
problems in this one shop, I received full support from the commander on
down to the workers to make changes happen."
So in 1992, Holloman established an ergonomics committee to identify
workplace ergonomics stresses from injury logs, evaluate high-risk work
areas and prevent future injuries. The committee consists of
representatives from civil engineering, aerospace medicine, maintenance,
ground safety and others.
It operates with no annual budget, but used safety and health promotion
funds to purchase literature and video training programs. Actual
improvements in the shop, including tool purchases, came out of the
shop's operating funds.
Focusing first on the parachute shop, Berg set into motion a series of
workplace changes that would reduce dramatically the CTD-related
injuries. Many of the interventions in the shop's sewing operation were
basic and low cost.

Basic, low-cost changes

Traditional scissors were replaced with spring-loaded models to reduce
some repetitive motion. Electric scissors that cut through five layers
of the heaviest fabric were purchased to reduce repetitions. Sewing
tables and table edges were padded. Task lighting was provided with
adjustable arm desk lamps. And to address OSHA's recommendation to
provide adjustable table heights, Berg directed that tables be raised to
accommodate taller workers and that inexpensive, plastic stair-step
platforms be bought to make the job easier for shorter workers. 
Storage space was moved from underneath work tables to separate shelving
units, eliminating some bending and lifting.  To reduce lifting and
hauling, they relocated some packing operations closer to where the
chutes are stored. Electric lift tables with wheels were added to permit
easier movement of parachutes and to eliminate the vertical component of
lifts and carries.
Electric hoists replaced a hand-over-hand pulley operation used to hang
wet parachutes in a drying tower. Workers had been experiencing shoulder
and back discomfort that was totally eliminated by the mechanization of
the job. 
Yet, the actual chute repacking remains Berg's most daunting
intervention. Employees with steel bats weighing over 20 pounds must
repeatedly pound the folded chute into its container. A worker took
about 45 minutes to pack a single chute, with the entire shop packing
about 500 per week. With the limited duty of many shop workers, the
remaining workers had to pack as many as 50 in a week.
Attempts at reducing the pounding operations included pneumatic tools
and complex overhead suspension systems. But efforts either damaged the
parachute material or failed to pack it properly. Job rotation was
nearly impossible with the limited number of workers physically able to
perform the packing operation.
With no real alternative to the packing process, Berg decided to reduce
the workload and convinced supervisors to limit the employees to packing
no more than 20 per week.  
Additional parachutes were purchased to buffer the need to repack them
quickly during surge flying operations. The workers also found relief as
a change in aircraft landing procedures halved the number of drag chutes
used. The shop now packs about 250 chutes per month.
Berg hasn't given up on the idea of mechanizing the pounding operation
which he calls, "ergonomic enemy number one." However, with the packing
limit, he now has all but one worker returned to full duty.
Considering that some of these workers had performed these jobs for over
twenty years, many of them were resistant to the changes. Some claimed
the changes would make the job harder. "But I asked them to go along
with the changes for two weeks," said Berg, "after which the workers had
the option to go back to the old way. But they liked the new ways, once
they got used to them, and reported less leg and back soreness at the
end of the workday." 
The changes in the parachute shop cost about $25,000. 
The Holloman Ergonomics Working Group's program includes an educational
component to teach workers that awkward posture plus forceful
repetitions equals risk of CTDs.

A positive message 

"The message was delivered in settings that encouraged worker
participation," said Berg. "And once trained, we found that the workers
who know their job best are the greatest resource for simple ways to
improve the workplace."
The training takes two to three hours and focuses on giving workers the
ability to identify ergonomic stresses in their workplaces, share their
findings with their supervisors, and work together to fix them
themselves. High- and moderate-risk workers are required to attend the
training, but it is open to all base personnel.
Supervisors can request the Holloman Ergonomics Working Group to visit
their shop to help in assessing and resolving ergonomically stressful
jobs.
The base program also includes an occupational medicine program to
monitor workers in high-risk jobs. Workers are examined at least
annually by a physical therapist who can suggest ways to modify how
workers do their jobs and can develop individualized exercise programs
to build up a worker's strength.
For the parachute shop, active-duty military personnel are mandated and
civilians are invited to participate in an exercise program as part of
their duty day.
"The biggest concern in U.S. business and industry is that an ergonomics
standard will close businesses," said Berg. "I tell people that ideal
ergonomic solutions come when you don't think of Fred Flintstone with a
hammer and chisel, but instead you think of George Jetson, whose total
job is to a push a button.
"But it could cost millions," continued Berg, "to totally mechanize a
workplace, so the goal is to find reasonable solutions in a
cost-effective manner."
Other ergonomics problems addressed around the base included letting
each of the base telephone operators pick out ergonomically designed
seating and giving aircraft maintenance workers sit/stand workstations
and adjustable chairs.
In all, Holloman AFB spent about $50,000 to implement its program over
three years, according to Berg.  As a result of these efforts, the base
dramatically reduced its CTD exposure. An unexpected benefit was a
series of certificates from the U.S. Department of Labor acknowledging
it for valuable contributions in the promotion of occupational safety
and health programs in the field of ergonomics.

Avenor's fitness a warm-up to ergonomics


Avenor Inc. sees its 10-year-old employee fitness programs as the
important warm-up to its newer ergonomics campaign. The two work in
concert, much the way cardiovascular exercise goes with a stronger and
healthier heart.
The results: The pulp and paper mill in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada,
reduced direct costs of injuries, including workplace CTDs, by 94
percent, when the ergonomics improvements began.
 The fitness program has involved an on-site fitness facility, daily
warm-up exercises, employee fitness challenges between divisions,
exercise rehabilitation and special educational efforts. While the
ergonomics improvements have meant substantial educational efforts, job
modification and workstation adjustments have been picking up momentum
since 1992.
The fitness center, which is attached to the plant's health center to
facilitate referrals, includes a universal weight machine, free weights
and exercise bikes. 

The ergonomics evolution

"The fitness program evolved into ergonomics because we needed to. You
can only get so much benefit out of increasing employee resistance to
wear and tear until you have to reduce the load of the job and help
employees work smarter, not harder," said Francis Puchalski,
kinesiologist for Avenor. 
Avenor, which was named the safest mill by the Canadian Pulp and Paper
Association last year, employs about 1,500 people who produce newsprint,
magazine stock and tissues from wood chips. It also converts recycled
paper into a variety of products.
One of the company's ergonomics successes involves the recycle
warehouse, where injuries to wrists and elbows were a concern. In the
area where large bails of recycled paper are loaded off trucks,
employees have to cut off heavy wire wrappings with bolt cutters, pull
the wire off the bails and use a fork truck to push the paper onto
conveyor belts.
The wire wrappings were of various hardness and strength, so the number
of repetitions and the amount of stress the hand absorbed varied.  In
the fall of 1993, according to Puchalski, the wrist and elbow problems
had reached a "virtual epidemic."
About 20 percent of the 20 employees were reporting CTD-related symptoms
while many others were experiencing pain but not reporting it. 
The employees and supervisors pointed to the bolt cutters as the main
problem. However,  further analysis quickly revealed that it was the
required firm gripping and pulling of the wires, often in difficult
positions, that was the more serious issue. The wire wrapping also got
caught on the bails and transferred the sudden stop force to the
employee's hand, wrist, elbow shoulder and back.
As a result, Puchalski and his colleagues instituted a number of
actions:
-  Education sessions covering CTD issues and avoiding awkward postures
were held at the worksite.
-  On-site interviews and job analysis were conducted.
-  The work process was reviewed and some modifications were made.
-  Suppliers of the recycled paper bails were encouraged to reduce the
number of wires per bale and some were able to accommodate the request.
-  Different cutting systems and fully automated bail handling systems
were investigated.
-  The bolt cutter handles were padded.
-  Upper limb range of motion and strengthening exercises were
recommended.
-  Wrist supports with palm padding were made available to interested
employees.
 In a six-month follow-up to the interventions in the recycle warehouse,
surveys and worker and supervisor interviews showed that the issue of
wrist and elbow problems was gone, according to Puchalski. To date,
there have been no additional CTD-related claims.
In the pulp and paper industry, there are plenty of physical jobs in the
maintenance department, which is responsible for keeping the pulp and
paper machines  --  some old and new  --  in good running order. Like many
manufacturing industries, back problems have been an issue over the
years. In the last few years, more safety and educational efforts have
been yielding good results, according to Puchalski.

Attention to back injuries

Morning exercises, fitness initiatives and extensive educational efforts
within the department have gone a long way toward reducing the number of
back injuries. Providing better lifting devices, increased training on
equipment use and better body mechanics as well as ensuring that all
employees know they are responsible to get help when necessary have
contributed to the improved situation.
Maintenance employees used to work on the three large paper machines.
Now, workers are assigned one machine in order to become familiar with
its operation and quirks.
Machine maintenance occurs at specific intervals and for a limited time.
Workers often must assume awkward positions to replace parts in confined
spaces. In dealing with the older paper machine, some of the risk
exposures cannot be designed out of the job. Therefore, Avenor's program
emphasizes ongoing training and education to work better and smarter in
restricted conditions.
The maintenance department also has developed a successful job-approach
program that reminds employees of nine different questions to ask
themselves each time they approach a job.
Not all of Avenor's efforts have been reactive. "We try to be proactive.
If we are aware of some changes coming to an operation, we will try to
get in there to make some recommendations," Puchalski said.

Getting in on the design

Avenor currently is building the latest, state-of the-art control room
for one of its pulp operations. The employees assigned will be operating
digesters, bleach plants and a chemical plant on VDTs in an office-like
environment.
Puchalski, along with an optometrist, made recommendations on the screen
size, icon and warning signal coloring on screens, location and type of
display units, data entry tools and workstation layout. They recommended
trackballs over mice, a C-shaped workstation large enough to seat two
people and quality adjustable ergonomics chairs. Color and eye acuity
testing will be an ongoing program.
There also have been some discussions regarding an exercise bike in the
control room and a satellite wellness center to help with employee
alertness, fitness and exercise maintenance.
Puchalski would not reveal the cost of the new control room.

When to investigate jobs

Signals to investigate jobs for ergonomics risks come from a variety of
sources, including employees, supervisors and the on-site nurse. But the
decision to pursue ergonomic changes rests with department heads.
"Our company has moved to a business division style of operation, and
occupational health and safety is increasingly looked at as a service
provider to these divisions," said Puchalski. "If we are involved in
recommendations for an exercise program or ergonomic changes, the OK
must come from division heads."
Employee education and training also is determined by the department.
While everyone receives instruction in occupational health and safety,
employees in jobs where there are higher CTD risks get more information
on ergonomics, injury prevention and self-management. 
Puchalski said the company also is considering a more formalized
ergonomics program, including more employee training and creating a
mill-wide ergonomics team to do job analysis and interventions.
So far, said Puchalski, "Senior management has been supportive of all
our efforts to help employees, including the budgeting to expand the
on-site fitness facility."
Ten years ago, Avenor Inc.'s chief executive officer wanted to do
something to help employees with back injuries. He decided to provide a
fitness center. Over the years, said Puchalski, it has become more
apparent that employee wellness and ongoing safety efforts including
ergonomics have much to offer to provide the workplace with the
healthiest employees.

Mass General Pharmacy Slashes Zofran Costs,  May Drop Drug From Its
Formulary


To Harold Demonaco, pharmacy director for Massachusetts General Hospital,
there's no real question that Glaxo's Zofran (odansetron) effectively
combats the nausea associated with chemotherapy. But it's such a good drug
with so few side effects that oncologists have been prescribing it for
almost every cancer patient in the hospital since its introduction in 1991.
And that's busted Demonaco's pharmacy budget.

In fiscal 1993, Mass General spent $900,000 on Zofran, making it the
costliest item in its medicine cabinet. Facing a potential outlay of $1.4
million in FY94, Demonaco took action.

First, he and his staff sat down with the oncologists and hematologists who
typically prescribe the anti-emetic and showed them that there were less
expensive, equally effective drugs available.

Next, they focused on getting doctors to use an appropriate amount of the
drug.  Most patients were getting between 30 and 40 mg a day, which
wasn't very cost-effective because the drug came in a 30-mg vial.

Mass General did its own studies and determined that anything beyond 24 mg
a day would not create any additional response. In late 1993, Demonaco
issued guidelines calling for a 24-mg daily dosage.

Since the dose is being cut by almost a quarter, Demonaco predicts that
Mass General's Zofran expense should be equally reduced -- savings of
about $250,000.  That's impressive, but costs may come down even further.
A competitor has hit the market, and is making things attractive enough
that Mass General is "seriously considering dropping Zofran from the
formulary," says Demonaco.

SmithKline Beecham's anti-emetic drug Kytril (granisetron) was launched in
late March. Demonaco says that according to Mass General's reading of the
data, "these two drugs are exactly equal."

However, Glaxo disagrees that the two drugs are the same, and has refused
to enter into a contract with Mass General. SmithKline, however, is
offering a discount.  Although Demonaco won't divulge that price, he says
the hospital expects a 50 percent reduction in costs for each chemo
patient.

PBM Mania Erupts


As fashionable as cafe lattes, pharmacy benefit management firms (PBMs)
have become the rage among drug manufacturers looking to expand market
share and pharmaceutical distributors hoping to add to their service line-
up. In the last six months, the sector's been abuzz as new PBMs were
created and many were bought by or entered into strategic alliances with
drug makers.

Witnessed so far: Cigna buying a PBM; the drugstore chain Rite Aid forming
a PBM; the National Assn. of Chain Drug Stores forming its own PBM; and
Caremark allying with three major drug makers. Last week, two more drug
makers took the plunge. For details, see the story below and other stories
on page 4.

Diversified To Go Global With SmithKline


Following in the footsteps of Pfizer, Merck, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, and
Bristol-Myers Squibb, SmithKline Beecham has marched into the pharmacy
benefit management arena in the hopes of gaining market share for its
products in the short term and steering R&D in the long term. SmithKline
says it will pay $2.3 billion for Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, in a
move that will more closely emulate the Merck-Medco merger than strategic
alliances favored by the other drug makers getting into the area.

For Diversified, a pioneer in the management of drug costs and in the
outcomes research area, the link with a global drug manufacturer gives it
the opportunity to offer its expertise worldwide, says Diversified
President Henry Blissenbach.  SmithKline "has a real appetite to see if the
[pharmacy management] concept is applicable in Europe," says Diversified
COO Terry Wills. In fact, DPS and SmithKline have already gotten started on
that project. Blissenbach sees the deal as having long term strategic reach
-- in gaining new clients and strengthening the sales and marketing of
SmithKline and Diversified products and services, and in managing the
overall cost of disease.

Diversified, a division of the HMO United Healthcare, currently manages
pharmacy benefits for 11 million people and has a 30,000-pharmacy
network; its clients -- the majority being United-owned HMOs and other
managed care entities -- spent about $2 billion in 1993 on drugs.
SmithKline had sales of about $6 billion in 1994, half from
pharmaceuticals. The firm is also a player in the generic field.

NO DRAWBACK SEEN

Many see selling out to a drug company as a competitive disadvantage, but
Blissenbach disagrees. Even though he was among those initially warning
about the conflict a Merck-Medco merger entailed, he says "we did not gain
one client because they left Medco because of the arrangement with Merck."
In fact, in a DPS survey of employee benefits managers, the firm found that
most didn't know that Merck owned Medco; once they found out, most were
pleased to know that Medco could draw on Merck's assets and R&D know-how,
says Blissenbach.

Now he's a believer that it is possible to be owned by a drug maker and
still give the client the best deal. However, Blissenbach does say that
drug makers are using the acquisitions to buy market share. "Merck
purchased Medco and SmithKline [bought] us for our ability to market
pharmaceuticals.  They fully expect us to market SmithKline drugs in
preference to others when everything's equivalent," says Blissenbach.

But that conflict is not as troublesome as it might appear; in reality SKB
only makes about 5 percent of the drugs currently on the DPS formulary.
"There's an enormous amount of drugs that are needed to put a competitive
formulary on the street," says Wills. "It's foolish to think we'd push them
off in favor of SKB products." He also notes that DPS has no control over
its HMO clients' formulary committees.

ACCESS TO HMO DATA

The HMO element will be key in the SmithKline/DPS deal; SmithKline will
have exclusive access to medical data of the 1.6 million members of United
HMOs. DPS already has the ability to link the information from the HMO
medical claims to the HMO pharmacy claims. In that way, DPS can tell
SmithKline what impact its drug therapy has on cutting the cost of
hospitalization or other treatment.

The two will also pursue outcomes research and disease management.
Blissenbach thinks that no PBM will turn away a chance to work with non-
affiliated or non-owner drug makers, and he says that DPS will work with
others. But he thinks that PBMs will be extra attentive to owners or
partners. "There will be very preferred and less preferred -- that's where
you'll see different formulary concessions and different research
priorities," he says.

However, until the dust settles from all the earthshaking activities in the
drug sector, it will be hard to tell where everyone stands exactly.
That's okay with DPS. "A deal like this is made looking futuristically,"
says Blissenbach. But, he adds jokingly, "the "future" in this business
is only two or three years."

Risk Sharing a Tough Proposition, Says Fallon Exec


Many drug companies say they want to help large drug buyers keep costs down
through risk-sharing contracts, but at least one HMO executive says that
hasn't worked for his health plan. According to P. David Jarry, MD,
clinical director of pharmacy for the Fallon Clinic, his HMO has been
approached numerous times by pharmaceutical companies to enter into
capitated contracts or other risk-sharing agreements. There have been lots
of negotiations, but no one's ever signed on the dotted line, he says.

Fallon is one of the more innovative HMOs in the country. With 165,000
enrollees, a 483-bed hospital, and 23 clinic locations, the Worcester MA-
based HMO doesn't have a huge nationwide presence but is often cited as an
example of what the future will look like. Fallon is a perfect lab for
contractual arrangements. As a group model HMO, its physicians are
employees, which gives it a lot more control over its doctors' prescribing.
It also uses a closed formulary and buys directly from drug makers.

Explaining Fallon's inability to come to terms with any drug companies,
Jarry cites terminology as a major stumbling block; everyone's definition
of capitation is different, he says. Drug makers have approached Fallon
with deals to give Fallon a price for a drug based on the number of HMO
enrollees and the expected use by that population. Or they have suggested
"capitating" an entire therapeutic class. The idea is that both parties
would reap savings for lower-than-expected utilization and conversely
would pay a penalty for higher-than-anticipated utilization.

But, Jarry says, "with a changing market, people are reluctant to commit to
price or volume for any long period of time." From the purchaser's point of
view, "for this to work you have to have some kind of time factor that's
reasonable." A short term contract doesn't give the HMO time to analyze or
adjust utilization.

For now, Jarry says, "I don't think we'll see good capitation arrangements
too quickly because there are so many variables that have to be worked
out." In the meantime, he expects buyers and sellers to "stick to the old
standards": direct discounting, rebates, bundling, direct buying, and use
of generics.

Turf War Brewing Over Federal Role In Cost-Effectiveness Data


Action in Congress on the health reform plan may create a turf battle over
which federal agency should dispense quality and cost information on drugs,
medical devices, and procedures. In its health reform mark-up, the House
Commerce Committee is likely to propose an expanded federal role in
planning, assessing, and implementing guidelines. Chairman John Dingell (D-
MI) is likely to include a bid by Rep. Ron Wyden (D-OR) that would give
more power to the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR).
Dingell is also considering a proposal by four outcomes gurus that would
create a new federal agency for quality, panel sources said last week.

Wyden's bill would steal a lot of FDA's fire by having AHCPR or some other
federal agency set national research priorities and give prior approval for
cost-effectiveness studies. The bill also would expressly limit FDA's power
to regulate cost-effectiveness claims made by manufacturers in advertising.

An even more aggressive agenda is being pushed by RAND's Robert Brook, MD,
Dartmouth's John Wennberg, MD, Duke's David Eddy, MD, and Harvard's Paul
Cleary.  In late April, they outlined for congressional staffers what one
attendee called an "FDA for guidelines." Under the policy, the new agency
would identify wasteful spending and establish national clinical trials.

FDA staffers however, are bristling at the notion that their agency can't
be the source of outcomes and effectiveness data for the public since it is
likely to begin getting that from manufacturers who will submit it
with applications for FDA approval on devices and drugs.

A Hopes To Develop Cost-Effectiveness Policy by Year's End


While drug makers use more and more cost-effectiveness claims in
advertisements for their products, FDA is still struggling to develop
guidelines on the use of such data in promotions. Drug makers often claim
their products cut hospitalization days or reduce need for additional
therapy, but usually the claims are based on comparisons to placebos, not
other drugs in the class. For now, such claims will continue to be reviewed
on an ad hoc basis, say FDA staffers.

FDA has put on hold its plans to hire an economist to help develop cost-
effectiveness claims guidelines. Drug advertising division people say they
have talked to some outside experts, but "our scheduling needs and
expectations didn't jibe with theirs." So agency personnel will write the
guidelines themselves; they hope to have a preliminary policy in place by
year's end.

That doesn't mean there won't be a lot of "outside input," the agency
notes.  FDA staffers have been meeting and talking to many interested
groups -- drug manufacturers, managed care representatives, and others.
Officials have also attended conferences and industry meetings and held
small seminars at which experts in the field presented information.

FDA is finding itself in the midst of a storm of confusion over who can
give out what information to whom in the cost-effectiveness arena.

At a recent meeting of the National Health Lawyers Assn., an attorney
warned that FDA may be considering regulation of the pharmaceutical
information disseminated by HMO pharmacy & therapeutics committees to
their doctors. The information often makes superiority claims for one
therapy in a class over another.  However, an agency official says, "We
haven't even been talking about this internally." But, he says, if drug
companies prepare the material for distribution to HMO doctors -- in
particular if it mentions unapproved uses of the drug -- "we would look at
it."

Value Health and Pfizer Alliance: A Powerful Attack on the Outcomes Front


While other drug companies talk about developing outcomes studies and
treatment guidelines in their alliances or acquisitions of pharmacy benefit
companies, Pfizer hopes to be acting. Hooking up with Value Health will let
Pfizer take the short cut, says ValueRx president and COO Steve Linehan
(see profile). The ability to have cost-effective data in hand and to
eventually manage the cost of disease will be the key to thriving long term
in the drug industry.

The Pfizer deal with Value Health has several components: ValueRx will
aggressively promote Pfizer products on its formulary in exchange for
discounts; Value Health Sciences, a pioneer in outcomes research and
guidelines, will develop such data on Pfizer products; and Value Health and
Pfizer will set up a $100 million joint venture to manage care in certain
disease states.

Value Health has long been respected in utilization management, outcomes
research, pharmacy benefits management, and managed care for mental
health.

Other PBMs, such as Caremark or Medco, while having sophisticated data
collection capabilities, do not have lengthy experience in developing
treatment protocols, says Linehan. That gives his company, and Pfizer, an
edge, he claims.

Linehan says ValueRx has another edge in that it, unlike DPS and Medco,
won't be owned by a drug company. ValueRx will aggressively push Pfizer
drugs to its clients but only where and when it is appropriate, he says,
adding that ValueRx is likely to ally with several drug makers.

ValueRx isn't alone in trying to forge multiple alliances, as many see it
as the best way to guarantee the drug buyer that it will get the widest
selection of pharmaceuticals at the best cost and with the best range of
value-added services.  But Linehan says that "it will require finesse to
put together a multiple alliance of manufacturers."

Pfizer, for its part, is satisfied with partnerships, as it has also struck
one with Caremark. "Acquiring a PBM is a huge cash outlay," says a Pfizer
spokesman.  "We think our strategy allows us to be very flexible; it's a
highly complex, fluid marketplace, and if it does change tomorrow we're
in a better position."

FoxMeyer Aims To Play With the Big PBM Boys


FoxMeyer Corp., which claims to be the nation's fourth largest
pharmaceutical distributor, is beefing up its PBM operations, with a buy of
Scrip Card Enterprises, a Salt Lake City firm that has managed prescription
benefits for small to medium-sized employers. Pharmacies that participate
in Scrip Card will get a complete marketing package that they can present
to the managed care buyer that includes competitive prices, generics, and
utilization review, says FoxMeyer VP Bob Davis.

Also in April, FoxMeyer launched FoxCare Network, aimed at giving the
company's 4,500 independent pharmacy customers wider exposure to managed
care. The network, says Davis, will also let pharmacists use "the medical
outcomes management programs developed for [FoxMeyer's] existing pharmacy
benefit management company, Health Care Pharmacy Providers." No mail order
services are planned for FoxCare, but it may be provided through Scrip
Card. FoxMeyer will offer its help free to pharmacists, but hopes to get
more pharmacists to buy more drugs from FoxMeyer.  "I can assure you we'll
be more supportive of those who buy from us," Davis says.

Caremark To Add Fourth to Alliance


A few weeks ago, drug makers struck their first blow against the Merck-
Medco powerhouse, when several teamed up with Caremark's Prescription
Service division.  In the war to maintain and gain market share, drug
makers have come to realize that prescription drug management firms can be
potent allies. "Our goal with Caremark is to become a bigger player faster
in this emerging health care arena," says a spokesman for Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer, one of Caremark's partners.

Caremark, which covers 28 million people through its pharmacy management
programs, has also snagged Pfizer and an unnamed company assumed to be
Bristol-Myers Squibb, and says it is about to announce an alliance with a
fourth drug maker.

In the short term, Caremark will have an incentive to shift market share to
partners' drugs, says Caremark Prescription Service corporate VP Kris
Gibney.  Caremark will give partners' products preferential treatment on
its formulary in exchange for discounts. The more lives switched and the
greater market share gained, the better pricing Caremark gets, says Gibney.
Long term, the goal is to steer data on patient utilization and outcomes
back to the partners.  The Caremark partners will have exclusive access to
Caremark information.  Caremark has just hired former MediQual CEO John
Kordash to head information strategy.  Caremark will also collaborate with
its drug partners on developing treatment guidelines. Eventually, Caremark
will offer capitated arrangements, but Gibney says that the deals are so
complex that none have been successfully put together yet. Caremark will
rely on drug companies to supply educational material and guidance on
therapy and, most importantly, financial backing. But the firm will
continue to act as the middleman -- the "Chinese Wall," as Gibney likes to
say -- between employers and the drug maker. Caremark, like other PBMs,
will profit from that arrangement.

Makers and Shakers --
ValueRx's Stephen Linehan:  Putting Politics To Work


Being the head of the nation's third largest drug benefits management
company has its headaches, but it beats being a small-town politician. At
least that's what Stephen Linehan, president and COO of ValueRx, has
concluded now that he's taken a stab at both. With $300 million in sales
and 500 clients, ValueRx has Linehan racking up the frequent flyer miles
and constantly chatting on the cellular phone. Linehan, who was named to
run ValueRx's day-to-day operations in November 1993, has no regrets about
ending his foray into politics. In fact, his experience should come in
handy when it comes to implementing ValueRx's goals, which include
brokering strategic alliances with drug makers.

In the late 1970s, Linehan was on the board of aldermen in Lake Saint Louis
MO.  At first he was content in that role, but like every politician, he
thought he could do a better job than the guy in office. He won his race
for mayor his first time out in 1980, and stayed in for a second term.

Looking back, he can't point to any major disappointments in his mayoral
career, and unlike many short term politicians he doesn't harbor much
bitterness over the experience. He proudly notes that while mayor, he
helped bring the town its first hospital and helped settle a lawsuit that
paved the way for more growth in the community. But he eventually decided
that "over the long run I'd rather be successful in business than in
politics."

Armed with undergraduate and graduate degrees in business administration,
he moved in 1985 to MetLife Health Care Networks, where he became CEO.
After five years with MetLife, he spent a year as senior VP for Managed
Care at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kentucky. Then, in early 1991, he
moved to Value Health's American PsychManagement unit in Washington DC.

When Value Health merged American PsychManagement with another provider,
Preferred Health Care, Linehan was offered the presidency at Bloomfield
Hills MI-based ValueRx. He was happy to move away from the politics-
infested DC area. Value Health, based in Avon CT, is a pioneer in the
management of mental health and substance abuse costs, workers' comp costs,
and in the field of outcomes research through its Value Health Sciences
unit. However, the company was initially built around ValueRx, which was
established in 1985. By 1990, ValueRx accounted for 70 percent of the
firm's revenues, says Alex. Brown managed care analyst Eleanor Kerns.

But in the interest of diversification -- thereby cutting risk for
investors -- Value Health has expanded and continues to expand into other
businesses.  Kerns gives the firm high marks for lowering its exposure on
the prescription drug side. But ValueRx still accounted for a little more
than half Value Health's revenues in 1993.

A Perfect Fit

Despite Linehan's lack of direct experience in the prescription drug
management area, he feels that his background in managing health plans and
mental health care costs prepared him well for dealing with pharmaceutical
cost containment.  As a managed care executive trying to hold down
expenditures, "typically, there were two costs that stuck out -- mental
health and prescription drug benefits." That meant that he had to "become
expert in those areas," says Linehan.

At American PsychManagement, he was given the opportunity to hone his
skills at managing the tricky area of psychiatric care and substance abuse
treatment. Large self-insured employers and insurers came to American
Psychanagement expecting to see costs in those areas reduced. Linehan and
his crew delivered. According to Value Health, while Linehan was in charge,
revenues at American PsychManagement grew from $30 million in 1990 to $90
million when he left in late 1993. Also under his tenure, Value Health
successfully negotiated a merger with another huge player in the field,
Preferred Health Care Ltd.

Linehan says that demand for prescription drug management carve-out
programs is being driven by the same dynamic that led to contracting for
mental health benefits management. Purchasers "want more cost-efficiency
and better care," he says. Already familiar with that desire, Linehan
thinks it will be short work to apply the lessons he learned at American
Psych to helping ValueRx clients.

Riding the Crest

Linehan is taking over at a time of explosive growth for the drug benefits
management industry. Once, there were only a few major players: Medco was
the king of mail order, United Healthcare's Diversified Pharmaceutical
Services was tops in the HMO sector, and ValueRx was among the leaders in
contracting with Fortune 500 self-insured employers. Drug costs were an
annoyance, but not enough of a concern for many employers to spend the
money on a separate benefits management program. But the demand for such
services has grown as drug costs have risen, leading to a vastly changed
marketplace.

There are hundreds of players now, from small private firms to subsidiaries
of HMOs to wholesaler-owned benefits managers. Even Rite Aid, a chain
drugstore, has thrown its hat into the ring. Now, with drug costs in the
news and employers getting more accustomed to hiring experts to help in
problem areas, drug benefits management has become trendy, if not
essential. Not all benefits managers will survive; consolidation has hit
health services and will soon make its mark on the drug benefits management
sector.

Making A Mark

It will be Linehan's job to assert ValueRx's role as a full-service
provider and ensure that it grabs a leadership position in this
increasingly sophisticated market.

ValueRx itself has been growing by leaps and bounds. In 1991, Value Health
bought a drug benefit management and a mail-order company, and added more
management businesses in 1993. Revenues skyrocketed in the ValueRx division
from $177 million in 1992 to $364 million in 1993. Clients include Allied
Signal, American Express, Federal Express, Rockwell, Tenneco, and United
Technologies. In August 1993, the firm won a contract from the state of New
York to manage the benefits of 700,000 employees, retirees, and dependents.

One of ValueRx's biggest coups so far was winning a contract for
Ford/United Auto Worker employees in January. Medco and PCS also had been
bidding on the contract, which covers 275,000 workers, retirees, and
dependents. ValueRx expects the deal to add about $90 million a year in
revenues.

As part of the contract, ValueRX will develop a formulary, offer concurrent
and retroactive drug utilization review and profiling of physician
prescribing patterns. The Ford pharmacy network is closed -- meaning
workers can only go to the designated pharmacies. More importantly, Ford
will be the first major employer that has signed a capitated agreement with
ValueRx. "We're delighted to have their business," says Linehan, who calls
the contract a "win-win for us, Ford, and the UAW."

However, ValueRx will assume a great deal of risk. The firm assured Ford
the auto maker would only be liable for fixed costs involved in delivering
pharmaceuticals and managing the use of drugs to the workers. The downside
for ValueRx: It will have to absorb any overutilization or variability in
drug pricing.

Linehn says the way to beat that is through strategic alliances with drug
makers, such as the one it just signed with Pfizer. And ValueRx will be
working directly with Ford and UAW on getting workers to be better
educated drug consumers.  "Ford's not just interested in controlling costs
for the three-year agreement, but extending it into the future," says
Linehan, who adds that ValueRx is "doing what we can to ensure quality and
to work together to contain costs. The recognition is that they're not just
dumping off risk; it's all three parties working together."

Focus on Outcomes and Alliances

As Linehan well knows, the future of prescription benefit management is
entangled with the interests of drug manufacturers. Thus, ValueRx, like
many other PBMs, is focusing on developing its data and outcomes research
capabilities.

Although he still thinks there's a lot of ground to be gained with the many
employers and payers that still do not carve out drug benefits, once they
are under a plan, those payers are going to want to see continuous
improvement in their savings, says Linehan. The key to eking out further
savings will be effective alliances with drug makers.

ValueRx, however, will only strike deals with drug makers if it can
maintain control, says Linehan. "We feel we have to represent employers'
interest first because they're the ones paying the tab," he says, noting
that Merck's ownership of Medco has created the concern among buyers that
the focus for Medco will be to push Merck therapies.

And he says that it will be hard to give clients a full range of
therapeutic options if the company is owned by one drug maker. ValueRx
will forge alliances with several drug makers "and get the best drug
available for the person at the most cost-effective rate," says Linehan.
"No drug should be dispensed or prescription switched or changed unless the
data supports that it will be equal or better in terms of results for
patients."

Another important aspect of benefits management will be outcomes research,
and Linehan sees ValueRx as uniquely positioned for that job. Value Health
has two units that are intimately involved in outcomes research; ValueRx
will draw upon that expertise. "There's a real potential to demonstrate
that drug therapy delivered at the right amount and the right time will
save in medical expenditures," says Linehan. But even he admits that it
will take some convincing of clients.

"You have to work with an employer and tell them that spending an extra $5
million this year could save $20 million in other expenses." ValueRx hopes
to have the research in the future to do the convincing. But it will still
likely need some financial help from drug makers, says Linehan. He sees
ValueRx doing outcomes research in partnership with employer customers and
drug makers. The goal is to position ValueRx as the quality expert. Then,
"as the marketplace evolves, it should get us more business," says Linehan.

It will definitely take a politician's instincts to balance the competing
interests of drug maker, drug buyer, and drug benefits manager. Steve
Linehan's experience should help him navigate these tricky and untested
waters.--Alicia Ault Barnett, editor.

The Drug Industry Puts on a Kinder, Gentler Face


Covering up Armani suits with lab coats, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Assn.  (PMA) hopes to change its image with a new name and a new mission
that emphasizes its role as developer of "90 percent" of the drugs that
come to market. PMA will now be known as PhRMA -- the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America.  "The public relations spin is very
direct," PhRMA president Gerald Mossinghoff told executives attending the
association's annual meeting May 2. Outgoing PMA chairman William Steere
(chairman and CEO of Pfizer) spelled it out: "Our mission is research. It
is the defining characteristic of our industry."

The unveiling of the new improved trade group followed months of internal
soul searching driven by a failure to convince Congress, the Clintons, and
the public that drug firms aren't money-grubbing price gougers. Although
new PhRMA chairman Sheldon Gilgore (chairman and CEO of Searle) said that
PMA had made some strides in improving the industry's image, it wasn't
enough.  A year ago, said Gilgore, "we were a demonized industry"; today,
"we are less demonized."

PMA hired McKinsey & Co. to help the trade group become a better lobbyist
for its 100 member companies and win more points in the health reform
debate. Now the group will focus mainly on lobbying against price
controls, rebates, and other threats to profits. PhRMA has also hired
former Pfizer Washington office head and Glaxo exec Stephen Conafay to be
its new superlobbyist.

However, PhRMA still has an uphill battle convincing the federal government
that price controls are not necessary and large drug buyers that
manufacturers are ready to negotiate on price. The association's new
image was bolstered by holding its meeting at a staid Washington DC
hotel, not a lavish tropical resort. But Gilgore was seen getting into a
limo after a press conference.

Merck Wants Medicare Action -- If There Is Any


Trying to get in on the ground floor of a Medicare prescription drug
benefit, Merck sent a proposal to HHS and the White House last week
suggesting that the government allow private pharmacy benefits management
firms to use their tactics to control expenditures and quality for the
feds. However, it's not even certain that a Medicare drug benefit will
survive the grueling beating the Clinton health reform plan is taking on
Capitol Hill.

Under Merck's plan, Medicare would select up to three PBMs per region,
through competitive bidding, to manage drugs costs and quality for Medi-
care beneficiaries. Surprisingly, Merck advocates an "open" pharmacy
network; allowing any pharmacist who meets the terms to participate. Its
Medco business has used closed, exclusive networks.

So far, competitors haven't weighed in on Merck's proposal, but one says
that on the surface, "anything that applies the principle of competition
and private industry to government is good."

Salable


o FDA has cleared Bristol-Myers Squibb's Taxol (paclitaxel) for treatment
of breast cancer following failure of chemotherapy for metastatic disease
or a relapse within six months of chemo. Bristol claims that since the drug
can be administered in an outpatient setting that "this can eliminate the
need for an overnight hospital stay, resulting in greater convenience to
cancer patients, and potential cost savings to the health care system." The
drug was approved last December for ovarian cancer not responsive to
initial chemo.

o Prozac may get FDA's okay for a new indication, which should drive
formulary managers mad. The widely-used antidepressant has gotten an FDA
advisory panel's okay to treat bulimia.

o Adding another notch in its belt, Coumadin (crystalline warfarin sodium)
can now be used to prevent and treat blood clots associated with artificial
heart valve replacement. Clinical trial data collected from 1967 to 1990
show that "long term oral anticoagulation therapy significantly reduced the
incidence of thromboembolism" in heart valve patients, says the drug's
maker Dupont Merck.  However, the benefits need to be weighed against the
risk of bleeding, says a company press release.

o Minneapolis-based MGI Pharma launches its Salagen tablets for treating
radiation-induced dry mouth in head and neck cancer patients. The firm will
be handling its own sales and marketing, initially targeting doctors,
nurses, and hospital-based dentists. The factory price to wholesalers is
$89.50 per 100; patients should expect to pay between $2.68 and $3 a day,
says the firm.

o Pfizer will start immediately marketing Glucotrol XL, a once-daily oral
drug to control blood sugar levels in diabetics. Pfizer says the single-
dose regimen should "markedly increase patient compliance" and that "strict
control of blood sugar levels may delay the onset of eye, kidney, or nerve
complications of diabetes."

o A new generic form of Ativan is available. Schein Pharmaceuticals has
received FDA approval of its ANDA for lorazepam injection.

Notable

o Prayers for a cheaper alternative to the expensive H2 antagonists are
about to be answered -- and the war for the billions spent on them has
begun.  Mylan Labs, in conjunction with Eli Lilly, is set to begin
marketing the first generic form of SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet
(cimetidine). Tagamet is losing its patent exclusivity on May 17; Mylan's
generic goes out the door May 18. Mylan will sell to wholesalers and Lilly
to managed care at about 30 percent off the brand name price. Lilly will
seek risk-sharing or capitated arrangements and will help develop ulcer
treatment guidelines. More generics are expected before year's end, and
some formulary managers suspect they haven't heard the last from Glaxo;
that firm will probably weigh in with some offer to maintain its virtual
dominance of the H2 class.

o Kodak bucks the merger and acquisition trend in the pharmaceutical field.
The company announced last week that it will sell its Sterling Winthrop
drug unit.

o A coalition of hospitals, insurers, HMOs, and other drug buyers,
including Kaiser, United Healthcare, and Premier Hospitals Alliance calling
themselves the "Coalition of Health Care Providers Concerned About Rising
Drug Costs," wrote to Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) May 3 seeking to ax the
Health Security Act provision that would extend equal discounts to all drug
buyers. The provision has been seen as a political favor to pharmacists,
but the coalition said that if approved, manufacturers "are likely to
respond by limiting discounts to all purchasers."

o Initial results from the AHCPR-funded five-year Stroke Prevention Patient
Outcomes Research Team (PORT) study being conducted by researchers at Duke
Medical Center found that the cost of stroke is closer to $30 billion a
year than previous estimates of $15-20 billion. The study also uncovered
huge regional variations in cost and success of treatment.

o With five new products, Merck's West Point Pharma now offers generics
that account for 20 percent of a typical drugstore's dollar volume in
generics.  The new products: alprazolam, carbidopa/levodopa, gamfibrozil,
ketoprofen, and naproxen. The products will be made by "several leading
generic manufacturers" and sold under the West Point label.

Roche's Syntex Buy Will
Raise Outcomes Profile


With its impending acquisition of Syntex, Roche will gain greater entree
into the world of outcomes research, where Syntex is acknowledged as one of
the leaders.  The firm has been using outcomes to determine whether to
continue clinical trials on its own products for the last several years.
But Syntex's relatively paltry pipeline and the fact that most of its major
drugs are facing generic competition has made it an acquisition candidate
for those same several years.

Roche is paying $5.3 billion, or $24 a share, for the Palo Alto CA-based
drug concern.  That's a 57 percent premium over Syntex's closing stock
price the last trading day before the announcement, but seems small when
compared to the billions being tossed around to acquire pharmacy benefit
management firms that have no R&D capability.

The Syntex buy is another example of the consolidation trend in the drug
sector as manufacturers look for ways to streamline operations in the wake
of declining profits.  If Syntex shareholders tender a majority of their
stock and vote to approve the deal, Roche will become the fourth largest
drug company in the world.  Syntex will gain a presence win South America,
Japan and the Middle East.  Roche gains not only Syntex's outcomes
expertise but its strong marketing organization, which has successfully
built a franchise around the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories Naprosyn (A
$700 million drug), Anaprox, and Toradol.

To hang on to Naprosyn sales, Syntex formed a generic unit, Hamilton
Pharma; it also recently got FDA approval to take Naprosyn over-the-
counter.

EUROPEAN APPROVAL TIMES LEAVE US LAGGING BEHIND

BRUSSELS - A study on European approval times for medical technology
has revealed that patients in the US wait up to three times as long as
their European counterparts for government approval of new medical
devices.

The study, conducted by Medical Technology Consultants Europe Ltd
(MTCE, Brussels), found that higher-risk, breakthrough medical devices
were approved in European Union (EU) within 80-120 days, provided the
manufacturer passed a European Union facility inspection (which is
completed within 120 days).  The study also found that new lower-risk
devices entered the European market with no delay once a manufacturer
passed the initial facility inspection.  Similar devices take an
average of 178 days to be approved in the US.

One reason for the speedier approvals, noted the study, is the number
of authorised bodies that can carry out the approval procedure.  "The
approval procedures are carried out by a number of authorised
certifying bodies spread throughout Europe, rather than the one
authority in the US [the Food and Drug Administration]." MTCE said that
there are 35 third-party organisations, known as authorised bodies to
carry out the approval procedures for medical devices throughout the
EU.

Point of contention

This is a particular point of contention, with the US Food and Drug
Administration.  In testimony before the US Congress, FDA commissioner
David Kessler recently criticised key provisions in FDA reform
legislation allowing third parties to take part in the review process.
However, US device manufacturers are citing the European study's
findings as additional proof that FDA reform is essential.

Maurice Freeman, MTCE's principal and a former European Commission
medical device official, said, in a statement prepared for the US
Senate Committee on Labour and Human Resources (which has jurisdiction
on FDA reform legislation), "Many patients who benefit from the
applications of such new devices in Europe would have [under US
approval times] either not received the benefits from the use of such
devices or in many cases would have died."

The FDA takes four times as long to approve breakthrough medical
devices than is allowed by US statute, according to the Health Industry
Manufacturers Association (HIMA - the US trade group for medical device
and diagnostic manufacturers).  HIMA says the approval times for these
devices have nearly doubled since 1990 and; the FDA's record on
approving incremental improvements to existing devices is similar, with
approval times also nearly doubling since 1990.

"Manufacturers simply aren't as eager to research and develop devices
in the US knowing that they'll face these egregious delays," said HIMA
president Alan Magazine.  "It's a double whammy - the patients wait for
devices stuck in the FDA's pipeline, and manufacturers have little
incentive to bring new devices into that pipeline in the first place."

The difference between the US and EU review process for medical devices
is not a matter of safety, Mr Freeman said.  "The European route is
extremely rigid in its requirement for the manufacturer to provide
suitable evidence as to the development process, to verify the design
by comprehensive review process and to manufacture under controlled
conditions," he added.  The current EU review process for breakthrough
medical devices was implemented in 1992.

Both the American and European systems contain sound elements that are
essential in protecting public health, notes HIMA.  "We are aware of no
study that shows that medical devices on the market in Europe are less
safe than those in the US," Mr Magazine said.

According to another recent study conducted by The Wilkerson Group, a
New York-based independent consulting firm, FDA delays in approving
devices will lead to the loss of US jobs to nations where approval
processes are more streamlined - an estimated 50,000 over the next five
years.  Governments in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and elsewhere
have already begun to highlight the impediment of FDA regulatory delay
in their marketing materials to attract US businesses overseas.

IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC DIRECTIVE CLEARS EP FIRST READING

STRASBOURG - European Union (EU) proposals to extend legislation on the
sale and use of medical devices to in vitro diagnostic equipment
cleared its first reading in the European Parliament on 12 March.
However, the assembly's endorsement was heavily qualified by 50
amendments, many of which were accepted by Industry Commissioner Martin
Bangemann.

Among the key issues that emerged were compulsory use of "local"
language - resisted by industry - and whether the EU should operate a
central data bank to aid monitoring.  Ethical aspects of devices using
human substances were another area of concern, with several speakers
calling for these to be dealt with under separate procedures.

Commissioner Bangemann said he was prepared to take on board 47 of the
78 amendments originally tabled, although a dozen involved linguistic
problems and were not put to the vote.  Among the accepted amendments
were those concerned with safety, protection and quality.  There were
accepted provisions concerning incidence reporting and use of a data
base for medical devices on the market.  One change placed the
Commission in the reporting loop with member states and may mean a
possible role in decisions to withdraw problematic devices.
Commissioner Bangemann also accepted an amendment making it clear that
the Directive would not affect "national laws which provide for the
supply of diagnostic medical devices and products by a medical
prescription".

Accepted amendments also clarified definitions and made wording
changes, such as "clinical laboratories" being called "medical analysis
laboratories".  In those provisions that pertained to human tissues and
substances produced from such tissue, the word "cells" was added.
Additionally, "packaging" was added to items that discussed standards
of design and manufacture.

Much of the debate centred on those amendments that the Commissioner
was not prepared to accept.  Chief among these were language and
labelling concerns.

Labelling could involve major costs

On use of languages, Commissioner Bangemann accepted it would normally
be self-evident that the language of the country of intended sale
should be used.  "However, in this specific case, this is not so
logical because 95 per cent of these products are for use by experts,
people who as a general rule are familiar with two or three languages
used in medicine.  It's not just a matter of labelling but also
handbooks and software, which are becoming increasingly important in
the use of these devices.  Therefore, it would involve major costs,
particularly in the case of smaller member states," he said.

Producers in smaller states, seeking to release their products on the
single market would be forced to have information translated into the
11 principal languages used in the 15 EU member states.  Commissioner
Bangemann insisted that the proposals would not preclude member states
from introducing a rule to that effect for its own producers.  However,
the Commission was prepared to re-examine the idea if it attracted
support in the Council of Ministers.  The original text of Article 4(3)
provides that member states may require information to be provided "in
their national language(s) or in other Community language(s) to the
extent that it is needed for safe and correct use of the device".

He also rejected Scottish Nationalist member Mrs Winnie Ewing's
(successful) Amendment 71, which would add "reagents and reagent
products of biological origin for the diagnosis of genetic diseases,
the detection and dosage of tumorous markers and the dosage of
hormones" to the Directive's annex listing of reagents and reagent
products for which conformity assessment procedures would be required.

In the Commission draft, this listing is limited to blood grouping and
detection of markers of HIV infection, Hepatitis B and C.  The
Commissioner also said he would be prepared to revisit this question.

As drafted, the Directives will cover reagents, instruments and
equipment for examining tissues or substances from the human body for
medical purposes and would include kits for conducting pregnancy or
cholesterol tests.  Currently subject to national rules, these devices
will have to comply with EU safety requirements before being marketed.

Time schedules complicated

The time schedules involved are complicated: the Directive will become
law 20 days after publication of the final, definitive text.  But
member states will have to allow continued marketing of devices
complying with current, national rules for a period of four years after
that act of final adoption.  Meanwhile, member states will then have to
transpose the Directive's requirements into national law by April 1998.

The proposals now go to the Council of Ministers, so that the 15 EU
member state governments can agree their own "common position" on the
proposals from the European Commission.

Rapporteur for the assembly's committee on industrial policy, French
parliamentarian Alain Pompidou, himself a professor of medicine, noted
that the legislation was a follow-up to two medical device directives
dating from 1990 and 1993.

Like several other speakers, Prof Pompidou was uneasy about the "hands-
off" approach followed by the Commission.

Procedures leaving quality control as a matter for manufacturers might
be justified for instruments using stable materials and electronic
circuits.  Prof Pompidou said the use of diagnostic medical devices
involved two major problems: stability of biological reagents, in the
case of 35 per cent of devices using immunological or other type
reagents, and the "potentially dramatic and tragic consequences of
diagnostic errors".

Arguing the case for EU monitoring and a requirement for defective
equipment to be recalled, Prof Pompidou said procedures had to be put
in place to identify and react to problems.  He described amendments
covering use of local language as "superfluous as far as health
professionals were concerned, but vitally important for self-testing
kits".

While Commissioner Bangemann was not prepared to go along with calls
for a full-blown, centralised EU monitoring system, he indicated that
the Commission might be prepared to adopt some points from milder
amendments.

Pending creation of a central EU database to which national authorities
would have access, transitional arrangements might entail manufacturers
being required to make notifications not just to the authorities of
their "home" state, but also to those of each member state targeted for
sales.

He also accepted that states should be under a duty to monitor
continuously devices and "take all necessary steps to ensure that
devices may be placed on the market and put into service only if they
comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive when properly
supplied, installed, maintained and used in accordance with their
intended purpose".

GRACE MERGES NMC WITH FRESENIUS REJECTING BAXTER'S $3.8 MILLION BID

DEERFIELD, IL - Baxter International has withdrawn its $3.8 billion bid
for Waltham, Massachusetts-based National Medical Care (NMC), WR Grace
and Co's dialysis services unit.  Baxter's bid for the business was
recently rejected by Grace, which favours the merger of NMC with the
dialysis products business of Fresenius AG (Germany), though the door
through which Baxter could have waved an increased bid was never firmly
closed.

Under the agreement, NMC will make a $2.3 billion payment to Grace
(Boca Raton, Florida), whose shareholders will get a 44.8 per cent
holding in the company, Fresenius Medical Care.  Fresenius USA, the
German group's US business (which manufactures and distributes products
for treating renal failure), will become a subsidiary of Fresenius
Medical Care, with the new company based in Germany and operating its
US business out of Waltham.  NMC, which operates 549 outpatient kidney
dialysis treatment clinics in the US and 75 abroad, plans to borrow
$2.3 billion for the transaction.

The deal should be complete by the third quarter of 1996, and will
result in the formation of possibly the largest integrated kidney
dialysis company achieving 1996 sales estimated at around $3.5 billion.
 The agreement will net Grace an equity gain of $700 million, a
significant portion of which it hopes to use to purchase as much as 20
per cent of its common stock.  Fresenius Medical Care is expected to be
traded publicly on the New York and European stock exchanges.

The withdrawal of Baxter's offer ends analyst speculation about whether
the company would raise its bid, especially considering the formidable
competitive strength of a Fresenius-NMC merger.  Baxter, however,
believes the impact on its own renal business will be limited.  Even
so, Baxter remains confused by Grace's flat rejection of what it
considered a "fair" offer and was reluctant to sit and negotiate
further.

Baxter had been in discussions with Grace since December 1995, and
stands by its bid to buy out NMC (the $3.8 billion deal would have
involved a straight $2 billion payment to Grace and a $1.8 billion in
Baxter common stock).

Early in February Baxter made its offer public, a move widely agreed to
represent a forceful invitation to push Grace into formal negotiations.

Baxter's chief executive, Vernon Louks, described the bid in a letter
to Grace counterpart, Albert Costello, as "substantially more
favourable to the Grace shareholders than the Fresenius proposal." He
added: "We will not increase our offer...since Grace management
continues to refuse to discuss our proposal and has determined to go
forward with the Fresenius transaction, we hereby withdraw our
proposal."

Last year, Baxter, with annual sales of $10 billion overall, including
$1.3 billion from its kidney therapy products, announced its intention
to split the company by spinning off its hospital supply division.  The
"new Baxter", essentially its medical specialities operations (with
annual sales of about $5 billion), includes its renal business.  If the
acquisition of NMC had gone Baxter's way, it was expected to have
diluted earnings by less than 5 per cent in the first year, and started
to add to earnings after about 18 months.

WR Grace, with interests lying foremost in specialty chemicals,
originally proposed to spin-off the NMC business to stockholders late
last year, after rejecting a $3.5 billion takeover bid for NMC by the
unit's chairman, Constantine Hampers (who will stay with the company if
the merger goes ahead).  Plans were delayed, however, by US federal
investigations into NMC's billing practices.

Fresenius will assume NMC's legal obligations

As part of the merger deal, Fresenius will assume all of NMC's legal
obligations from on-going government investigations.  The company is
the subject of three federal investigations.  Most recently, The New
York Times reported, the company received a letter from the US
Attorney's office in New Jersey stating that NMC was the target of a
New Jersey grand jury investigation.

Meanwhile, a separate inquiry into contracts between NMC's dialysis
subsidiaries and physician supply and service companies is underway by
a grand jury in Virginia.  Moreover, a US attorney in Massachusetts has
issued five subpoenas for NMC records in connection with an
investigation into a number of management, employee and accounting
practices.

NMC's three divisions achieved sales of $2.1 billion overall last year;
divided between its dialysis services division, providing outpatient
and inpatient hospital dialysis services ($1.5 billion), its homecare
division, offering home treatment services ($327 million), and its
medical products group, which manufactures dialysis products ($300
million).  The world market for dialysis products is estimated to be
$3.1 billion, with the major players being Baxter (holding 42 per cent
of the market), Fresenius AG (13 per cent), and Gambro AG (32 per
cent).

Meanwhile, Baxter recently opened its second medical products factory,
Eurovac Ltd, in Malta to manufacture CRD flex suction canisters.  The
company expects the plant to export 3.7 million units, valued at $3.4
million.  during its first year of operation, primarily to Germany and
Italy.

SMITH & NEPHEW PROFITS UP IN 1995

LONDON - Healthcare group Smith & Nephew Plc (S&N) announced pre-tax
profit before exceptional items up by 5 per cent to #180.4 million
($275.7 million) for the year to 31 December 1995.  Exceptional charges
of #14.6 million stemming from the integration of acquisitions were
largely offset by #11 million in gains from disposals.Turnover
increased from #965 million to #1.02 billion despite much tougher
market conditions, including pressures on healthcare budgets worldwide.

Chairman Eric Kinder said: "We do not expect any easing of the
difficult market conditions in North America, but further improvement
in Europe is likely together with continued progress in the Far East."

Turnover rose from #173.1 million to #186.1 million in Africa, Asia and
Australia.  With a rapid increase in sales for the second half of the
year, Asia and Japan experienced particularly strong growth at 30 per
cent and 25 per cent respectively.  Sales in the UK grew by 12 per cent
to #175 million, attributable to the establishment of a single sales
force for healthcare products which generated substantial orders from
the National Health Service, combined with a strong performance from
the consumer healthcare sector.  In Continental Europe, sales expanded
by 8 per cent to #230.3 million; the markets in France and Spain had
recovered in the second half of the year, while S&N was beginning to
build a stronger position in Germany.

In North America the expansion of managed care combined with the
consolidation of hospital groups and the increase in co-operative
buying organisations meant that S&N had to deal with a smaller number
of professional buying groups.  Sales slowed in the second half, but
still rose by 5 per cent to #404.7 million for the year.

Strong product lines during the year included chronic wound dressing
Allevyn, wound cleanser IntraSite Gel and IV3000, an intravenous
catheter dressing.  Rehabilitation products, extended by the
acquisition of Homecraft for #29 million during the year, also
performed impressively.  The slowdown in the US market had retarded the
growth of trauma, endoscopy and orthopaedic implants, although they
continued to do well in other markets, achieving sales growth of
between 4 and 6 per cent.

On the whole, selling prices were expected to remain "at best static",
but Mr Kinder believed the strengths in S&N's marketing and research-
backed innovation "will enable us to drive forward the competitiveness
of our product range to achieve steady growth and to outperform global
healthcare markets".

ESAOTE SEES INCREASED SALES, HOPES TO GO PUBLIC

GENOA - Spurred by exports, the Italian company Esaote reported
increasing sales of electro-medical devices in 1995 with plans to be
quoted on the stock market later this year.

The Genoa-based firm put its 1995 sales at L258 billion ($1.6 million),
up 11 per cent from the previous year, with its net income rising from
L4.8 to L8 billion.  Esaote will hold an extraordinary meeting of its
shareholders to decide its entry into the stock markets, possibly in
July 1996.

The company, characterising internal demand as "stalled", said its
overseas business now accounts for 53 per cent of sales, doubled from
two years ago.  In addition, the position of its overseas affiliates -
the US Biosound, Esaote France and Esaote Deutschland - are also
reported to have improved.

"The salient point of our growth", says Carlo Castellano, president and
chief executive officer of Esaote, "is our increasing global role in
the strategic sectors such as ultrasonic devices, tomography and
dedicated magnetic resonance."

Once a government-owned company and privatised in the recent flurry of
divestments by the state, 15 per cent of Esaote's shares were bought by
the Italian pharmaceutical group Bracco last year for L18 billion.
Bracco together with other major shareholders, such as Advent
International, Electra Investment Trust, Ipef-Euroventures Italia, Arca
Merchant and Sofipa, control 71.8 per cent of the company's shares.
The remainder belongs to Esaote's managers.

PRIVATISATION ON AGENDA FOR ORTOPEDICHE RIZZOLI

BOLOGNA - Officine Ortopediche Rizzoli, one of Italy's prominent
producers of artificial limbs, is considering privatisation to break
out of its current slump and is thinking about changing its focus to
high-technology products.

Ortopediche Rizzoli, which began producing wooden limbs in Bologna 100
years ago, is still a prestigious name in the production and sales of
orthopaedic artificial limbs.  In addition, the company produces
surgical equipment, wheel-chairs and other rehabilitation products
(some of it by handmade methods).

Its privatisation - the company is 94 per cent publicly-owned including
partial ownership by the city of Bologna - is expected this year.
Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara, a local entrepreneur who owns the Bologna
football team, has offered Ortopediche Rizzoli some L11 billion ($6.8
million), according to La Repubblica (the Italian national daily).  Mr
Frascara told La Repubblica he believes he could double the company's
sales.

Last year, the company's sales remained constant at L43 billion and it
broke even, although a net loss of about L1 billion is predicted for
1996.  Sales of orthopaedic devices account for 85 per cent of its
business, with 70 per cent of its total production going to Italian
hospitals and 30 per cent to private institutions and citizens.

In one high-tech venture, the company shot to fame at home and abroad
through its pioneering work in mioelectric hands capable of interacting
and amplifying cerebral impulses through receivers.  It also introduced
"intelligent" prosthesis to Italy.  One of its products is the "Bologna
Boot", which assists persons with spinal defects to walk with ease.

INCENTIVE SECURES OWNERSHIP POSITION IN GAMBRO

STOCKHOLM - Incentive Ab has consolidated its ownership position in
Gambro, the Swedish manufacturer and supplier of dialysis systems,
acquiring the outstanding 25 per cent of shares in the company from
pension funds, financial institutions and private owners in Sweden.

Incentive shareholders accepted the offer to such an extent that it
held 99.4 per cent of the capital and 99.7 per cent of votes.

Incentive's push to streamline its hold on Gambro came less than eight
weeks after the company presented a bid worth SKr10.3 billion ($1.4
billion) for the outstanding shares in Gambro.  Incentive's pre-bid
status was already strong, with the investment company holding 42 per
cent of shares and 58 per cent of votes.

A significant factor in the success of the bid was the acceptance of
the Crafoord Foundation, which was the second biggest owner in Gambro
after Incentive, with 2.2 per cent of shares and 11.3 per cent of
votes.

Gambro was founded by Holger Crafoord in 1964, and was initially
focused on the development of kidney dialysis machines and after care
products, areas in which the company still holds a strong market
position worldwide.

The bid emerged as Gambro issued an updated profit forecast for FY1995,
projecting earnings of SKr1.5 billion for the year, that was below what
some analysts had been anticipating.

Incentive's action in bidding for Gambro signals a change in the
company's strategy, which has been focused on acquiring minority and
strategic holdings in many of Sweden's leading industrials.  The
company's portfolio includes large shareholdings in Ericsson, Asea
Sweden and Electrolux.

Incentive is now expected to divest these shares as part of a new
policy of developing into a healthcare and energy systems group.
Resultingly, analysts forecast the company will divest non-core
interests in 1996.

"Once the Gambro acquisition is complete, more than half of the
Incentive group's annual sales will be generated from activities linked
to medical and diagnostic systems.  We intend to invest more heavily
into this business segment and sell-off non-core activities in the
future," said Incentive's chief executive officer Mikael Lilius.

The takeover is expected to boost Incentive's profit per share by about
SKr7 to SKr10 in the short-term.  "The long-term picture is more rosy,
and we expect a goodwill gain from the takeover of SKr8 billion and
increased profitability," said Lilius.

GEHE CONSIDERS TAKEOVER BID FOR HAFSLUND-NYCOMED

BONN/OSLO - Gehe, the German medical technology systems group, is
reported to be considering a hostile takeover bid on Hafslund-Nycomed,
Norway's leading supplier of healthcare products and hospital
equipment.  Gehe, which had revenues of $10.4 billion in 1995, is
stated to be particularly interested in acquiring the Norwegian
company's highly-profitable and international X-ray contrast fluids
division.

Hafslund-Nycomed will, under a plan approved by its board at the end of
1995, be split into two companies - medical products and power
production/distribution - both of which are to be listed on the Oslo
Stock Exchange in 1996.  Hafslund is also examining a possible listing
in Stockholm.

Gehe is in an acquisitive mood at present.  The company recently
presented a #5/share offer to acquire UK pharmaceuticals company Lloyds
Chemists, which has a market value of #6 billion ($9.5 billion).

The Norwegian group has been looking for an international partner since
1994.  Its search was nearly realised in 1995, when Hafslund signed a
letter of intent to merge with the US company Ivax.  This deal fell
through when Hafslund's Norwegian shareholders held out for a higher
price which Ivax refused to pay.  Although the merger was abandoned,
both companies agreed to enter into a long-term co-operation deal.

LEIRAS SET TO BE SOLD

HELSINKI - Leiras Oy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Huhtamaki group
and Finland's second biggest manufacturer of medical products, has
denied any connection between its intended sale and recent negative
publicity surrounding controversial tests carried out for the company's
contraceptive implant, Norplant, in Africa.

Huhtamaki is holding talks with at least four potential buyers,
including Astra, Ciba Geigy, Upjohn-Pharmacia and Bayer.  Orion,
Finland's largest pharmaceuticals manufacturer, is reported to be
looking for an international partner ahead of tendering a bid for
Leiras.

Huhtamaki's chief executive officer Timo Peltola said the group's
decision to divest Leiras was based on the need to restructure and
concentrate its future business around a single core division, foods
production and marketing.

"Our conclusion has nothing to do with the recent publicity involving
Norplant.  The simple truth is that Leiras is not large enough to
support the heavy investments in research and development (R&D) it
needs to make in future years" said Mr Peltola.  Leiras specialises in
developing and producing bone metabolism and ophthalmics as well as
oral contraceptive pills and implant devices.

The negative publicity that surrounded Leiras emerged following a
British television programme's (BBC's Panorama) investigation into
trial tests of Norplant within the framework of a tribal village in
west Africa.  The programme, which focused on the alleged unsystematic
nature and side-affects emanating from the tests, quoted international
researchers from the US and elsewhere who questioned the product's
reliability and innocuousness.

The negative publicity affected the value of Huhtamaki's shares and
caused much discussion within senior company circles, despite a company
declaration that associated tests in Africa had been conducted under
contract with a research firm outside the group.

"The rising trend in R&D expenditure, coupled with the downward
pressure on drug pricing due to cost savings programmes launched by
healthcare providers, is forcing the industry to seek greater economies
of scale from larger unit sizes.  The wave of mergers which has
affected the top 40 companies globally is now making itself felt among
smaller firms too," said Mr Peltola.

Describing Leiras's profit and R&D track-records as "excellent", Mr
Peltola said that the cost benefits to the company of remaining
independent were rapidly disappearing.  The company's R&D outlay
amounted to 20 per cent of net revenues in 1995, while the company
would find it increasingly difficult to find sufficient resources to
market its products internationally.

"We feel that Leiras's potential will be best realised as a specialised
unit within a major international pharmaceutical company.  The
divestment has attracted a lot of attention, and we expect to close the
sale during the spring," said Mr Peltola.

Leiras reported operating earnings of $32 million on revenues of just
over $204 million in 1995, in a year when the firm accounted for 11 per
cent of Huhtamaki group's total sales volume.  Some 51 per cent of
Leiras's production was exported.  The company operates three
production plants in Finland, with sales subsidiaries located in
Singapore, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

SPECTRAL DIAGNOSTIC DISAPPOINTED WITH US SALES EFFORTS

VANCOUVER - Everyone says that Spectral Diagnostics Inc of Toronto (SDI
on the Toronto Stock Exchange) has a good product.  It's a credit-card-
sized diagnostic kit that can determine in seconds from a blood sample
whether an emergency room patient has, or has not had, a heart attack.
Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in March l995, Spectral
expected hot sales of the product to hospitals and emergency care
centres across North America.

It chose Dade International of Deerfield, Illinois (a Baxter
subsidiary) as its US marketing partner.  However, sales revenue since
product launch a year ago has been disappointing: C$400,000 ($289,855)
in April-September l995, and only $70,000 in the last quarter of the
year.  Share price, which had boomed up to C$40 on news of the FDA
approval, has slumped, and is bumping along this year in the C$10-12
range.

Spectral appears to be less than satisfied with its US partner's
efforts.  It recently reorganised its arrangement with Dade, allowing
it to find additional marketing partners, or even replace Dade
entirely.

Chris Plaxton, Spectral executive vice-president said: "We wanted to
see sales increase at a faster pace than we thought we were going to
see them increase with just the Dade International sales force.  Also,
Spectral is prepping a new diagnostic product for the marketplace.  A
successor to the CK-myoglobin test kit now on the market, this would be
a four-component test, refining the diagnosis by adding two more
cardiac markers."

So far, however, Spectral has not announced any new marketing
arrangements, nor has the filing process for the new test yet been
completed.

I-TA SWINDLES INVESTORS

TAIPEI - The financial slump that has hit Taiwan's businesses hard
recently claimed a local medical instrument company as one of its
latest victims.  However, instead of down-sizing operations and
applying to the banks for loans, the company's operators "swindled"
their investors.

Chen Hsi-i and Hsueh Kuan-tsu, I-Ta medical instrument company's
general manager and owner, have been charged with fraud by Wu Yin-chih,
as well as two men surnamed Hung and Kuo.

Chen and Hsueh apparently approached the three investors with a
business proposal to expand the company's operations into mainland
China.  Chen and Hueh reportedly then deceived the investors into
thinking the I-Ta company was stable and had plenty of finances.

The pair wrote cheques to guarantee a NT$2 million ($7million) loan to
Hung, and asked Kuo for NT$1.2 million as a bidding deposit.  They
asked Wu to give them NT$1.5 million to finance the project and
promised that the money would soon be repaid.

After giving the pair a total of almost NT$5 million, Wu, Hung and Kuo
realised their money had gone to saving the financially crippled I-Ta.
They filed charges with the Taipei District Prosecutors Office on 29
February.

Chen and Hsueh have denied any wrongdoing.

FAULDING SEES MIXED RESULTS

SYDNEY - Australia's Faulding has reported mixed results for its
devices business in the six months to 31 December 1995, with better
than expected profits at Faulding Imaging and a loss at Selby
Scientific.  Primarily a drug distributor, Faulding, the largest
Australian pharmaceuticals company with first-half revenues of A$781
million ($582 million) up 13.8 per cent, also is a distributor of
devices.

Faulding Imaging's main activity is distribution in Australia of the
medical equipment and microscope lines of Olympus Optical of Japan.
Selby supplies scientific equipment and laboratory consumables in
Australia and New Zealand.

Sales figures for individual subsidiaries are not released, but the
company says sales at Faulding Imaging were marginally below those for
the previous corresponding period.  Profit contribution, on the other
hand, was ahead both of the 1994/95 first half result and budget.

At Selby Scientific sales matched the result for the same period in
1994/95, but the division recorded an after-tax operating loss of NZ$1
million ($645,161), which comes on top of an A$1.9 million loss in the
1994/95 year.  Faulding hopes for improved profitability following a
recent restructuring of the group.

FIRST HIV ANTIGEN TEST APPROVED

ROCKVILLE, MD - On 14 March the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the first antigen test kit to screen blood donors for HIV-1.
The new kit was also approved for use in diagnosing HIV-1 infections
and monitoring the progress of the disease itself.

The screening kit, manufactured by the Coulter Corp of Florida, is
known as the Coulter HIV-1 p24 Antigen Assay.  Based on an 8 August
1995 FDA recommendation to all registered blood and plasma
establishments, the test can be used within 90 days of the approval.

The Coulter test uses antigens (the virus' own proteins) which can
detect the virus about a week earlier than the antibody tests used
currently.  By reducing the "window period", when donors may be HIV-
infected but still have negative antibody tests, it has been estimated
that HIV-1 antigen screening could prevent around 25 per cent of the
current cases of Aids transmitted by transfusion.

Although the FDA has recommended that the test be used to screen blood
donations, it does not recommend that it replace the HIV antibody test
for routine patient testing and counselling in a medical setting.

The kit will be marketed to blood establishments by Ortho Diagnostics
Systems Inc, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (New Jersey).  There are
about 14 million blood donations processed annually in the US.

NEW DEVICE CAN WRITE WITH EYES

PARIS - Scientists at the National Health and Medical Research
Institute in Lille, France have developed a device that will assist
quadriplegics who cannot communicate.  The device allows them to write
with their eyes.

As the patient looks at a special keyboard, a laser-guided camera
records the stare as the patient's eye moves from letter to letter.
The camera feeds the selected letters into a computer, and the text
appears instantaneously on a computer screen.

The device, which is the result of five years of research, was
displayed at a recent Paris exhibition on language-learning techniques.
 Within a year, researchers expect that the device, called Deltavision,
will be fine-tuned and ready to market.

Delta 7, a humanitarian group that represents the interests of
paralysed people, organised funding for the project.

The Deltavision device is simple to use.  A camera in the middle of a
visual keyboard facing the patient focuses on the eye.  A red beam
reflects eye movement back to the machine.  Users need only look at a
key for less than a second for it to register, and can write about 50
characters per minute.  However, the system will only work for
quadriplegics with eye movements that are normal.

The technique has been successfully used by 100 quadriplegics in pilot
projects at rehabilitation centres in Nantes, Le Mans and Bordeaux.
The prototypes cost $20,000, but once the device is marketed, possibly
next year, Association Delta 7 expects the price to go down because of
larger-scale production.

CE MARK FOR INTRAVASCULAR DEVICE

BRUSSELS - Cardiometrics Inc of California received the Conformite
Europeene (CE) mark approval for its intravascular medical devices.

"This approval allows us to market our FloWire and SmartWire guide wire
products in all countries of the European Union without the need for
additional regulatory approval from any country," said Menahem Nassi,
president and chief executive officer.  "We believe that the CE mark
will streamline future product approvals, thus impacting the time to
market for our devices in key European markets."

Cardiometrics' products have been approved for use in most European
countries, and, to-date, more than 44,000 FloWire devices, the
company's lead product, have been sold for use in more than 300 medical
centres worldwide.  International sales currently account for about 75
per cent of Cardiometrics' revenue, as recently reported by the company
in its year-end earnings.

LASERSCOPE SEEKS BRAND RECOGNITION IN EUROPE

LONDON - Laserscope of California has received the Conformite Europeene
(CE) and International Standards Organisation (ISO) 9001 registration
from the British Standards Institution.  Robert McCormick, Laserscope
president and chief executive officer said, "These certifications will
allow us to compete more effectively in Europe and other international
markets by greatly simplifying the regulatory approval processes."

"Because the CE mark allows us to market the same model product in each
European nation," he said, "Laserscope brand recognition should grow.
From a manufacturing standpoint, we will no longer be compelled to
design, build and inventory different product configurations for each
individual country."

In 1995, international revenues represented 23 per cent of Laserscope's
total revenues, compared to 17 and 13 per cent of total revenues in
1994 and 1993, respectively.

Laserscope designs, manufactures, sells and services an advanced line
of medical laser systems and energy delivery devices for the hospital,
outpatient surgical centre and physician office markets.  It sells its
products in the US, the UK and France through its own direct sales
force and serves 20 other countries in Europe, the Middle East and the
Asia-Pacific region through regional distributors.

The Easi-Breathe inhaler is a proprietary product of the respiratory
franchise of the Ivax Corp (US).  With this inhaler, the company says
the patient does not need to co-ordinate inhalation with actuation,
because the active ingredient goes directly to the lung, not to the
mouth or throat.

FDA APPROVES CHOLESTEROL SYSTEM

NEW YORK, NY - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved
Liposorber LA-15 System, a medical device manufactured by Kaneka
America Corp of New York to lower cholesterol in people who, because of
a genetic disorder, have extremely high cholesterol levels and are at
very high risk of heart attacks early in life.  This small group of
people, about 4,000 in the US, is not helped by low fat diets and
cholesterol lowering medications.

The device is a filtering system that removes low density lipoprotein
(LDL) from the blood via a plastic tube inserted into the patient's arm
and connected to the filtering machine.  The process, similar to kidney
dialysis, is performed at a medical facility and takes about three
hours to remove the "bad" cholesterol and must be repeated every one to
two weeks.

A clinical study of 74 patients, who were on cholesterol lowering drugs
and diet, were treated with the device at 11 US sites.  After each
treatment the LDL levels in all patients were immediately reduced;
however, after 14 to 30 days, the LDL rose to levels that were apparent
before treatment.  Long-term benefits of the treatment, such as whether
it reduces angina, heart attacks or death, were not shown.

FDA is requiring the manufacturer to establish a patient registry to
track patients who receive this treatment in order to help determine
long-term risks and benefits.  Patients who receive this treatment
should remain on a low fat diet and continue to take cholesterol-
lowering medication.

FDA REJECTS NON-INVASIVE BLOOD SUGAR TESTING DEVICE

PITTSBURGH, PA - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Clinical
Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel did not recommend for
approval Biocontrol Technology's non-invasive glucose sensor for
diabetics.  The meeting held in late-February 1996 was sparked with
emotional, fiery and combatant exchanges by the public and the sponsor
directed against the advisory panel.

The non-invasive glucose sensor is a spectrophotometer which is
calibrated in a four hour process to recognise the individual user's
particular glucose pattern by calling on internal algorithms.  Once the
calibration has been completed, the forearm is placed on the sensor,
the start button pushed, and infrared light passes through the skin
into the blood and is reflected back to the sensor's computer.  The
pattern is analysed, converted to a blood glucose level, then displayed
on a digital screen quickly.

The company's device, if it was approved, would most likely have
replaced the current monitoring devices on the market today.
Presently, all devices that are on the market require an invasive
pricking of one's finger up to 10 or more times a day to monitor and
maintain accurate control of diabetes.  This is a painful and
debilitating experience for diabetics, especially children.

The meeting was marked by passionate pleas to the panel for approval of
the device during the open public session by mothers of diabetic
children and young and old diabetics.  Each speaker had a story of the
hardships of invasive testing and the resultant physical and
psychological injury suffered.  Even the company was engaged in heated
exchanges with members of the panel.

The main reasons for not recommending approval of the device were based
on the fact that the clinical study data presented by the company do
not support the intended use of the device.  There were 85 persons
initially enrolled in the clinical study but only eight were able to
qualify and complete the study.  The scale used to access accuracy of
the data was not acceptable because it was not considered an accurate
measure of error, said the panel.

The committee said more data are needed over a longer period of time,
and further study is needed with an increased number of patients,
including pregnant women and children.

MIDAC RECOMMENDS IN FAVOUR OF IMMUNOMEDIC'S CEA SCAN

ROCKVILLE, MD - Immunomedics Inc of New Jersey announced that the
Medical Imaging Drugs Advisory Committee (Midac), an external advisory
panel for the US Food and Drug Administration, unanimously recommended
approval for CEA-Scan, the company's diagnostic imaging product for
colorectal cancer.The FDA will now review the panel's decision.

"We are delighted that our first cancer imaging and diagnostic product
is in the final stages of the regulatory approval process and that the
panel recommended CEA-Scan's use in several settings," said Dr David
Goldenberg, chairman of Immunomedics.

CEA is expressed by more than 90 per cent of colorectal cancers, as
well as by a large number of other carcinomas, including lung, breast,
pancreas, uterus, and ovarian, and it has been show that this tumour
marker can serve as a useful target for radiolabeled antibodies.

In addition to CEA-Scan, the company's infectious disease imaging
agent, LeukoScan is undergoing regulatory review in Europe for imaging
osteomyelitis (bone infections).

FDA CLEARS PHADIATOP ALLERGY TEST

LONDON, CO - Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc received US Food and Drug
Administration clearance to market Phadiatop, a yes/no blood test to
determine whether a patient has an inhalant allergy.  Physicians using
the test take a blood sample to run through Phadiatop system to test
for a variety of different substances that may cause allergies.  The
results are obtained within hours.  The test is an alternative to skin
testing.

Mark D Myslinski, general manager for the Diagnostics Division of
Pharmacia & Upjohn, said that the Phadiatop system offers "physicians
and laboratories a blood test that may determine whether a patient's
symptoms are being caused by allergy or by a cold".  He noted that by
accurately diagnosing the cause of symptoms that are so similar,
appropriate treatment can be provided within a short time.  It is
estimated that 30 per cent of the US population suffers from allergy
symptoms.

Phadiatop is the latest in a panel of allergy tests that are offered in
the company's Pharmacia CAP System.  This system is currently being
used in over 2,000 laboratories worldwide.

SCALAR LAUNCHES SKIN MOISTURE TEST

TOKYO - Scalar Corp, a Japanese maker of video microscopes for medical
and industrial applications, has developed an inexpensive and light-
weight moisture checker.  According to a company spokesman, patients
place one end of the device on their skin, usually the face.  After
five seconds, the Scalar Moisture Checker beeps and gives a read out of
moisture content.

Scalar Corp hopes to expand the market for moisture checkers with its
new product.  The company claims conventional models are relatively
expensive so they are rarely installed in places other than a
laboratory.  However, the Scalar's device weighs 85 grams and sells for
Y12,800 ($134).

A prototype of the Scalar Moisture Checker was completed in March and
mass production is expected to commence in the near future at the
company's factory in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

The spokesman expects beauty shops and department stores to be the
first customers.

Scalar Corp also believes the product will be a success amongst
dermatologists.  It is investigating worldwide regulations, after which
it will make a final decision about how and when to approach the
medical community.

OMRON'S BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR

TOKYO - Omron Corp, Japan's largest maker of blood pressure monitors,
recently launched what it calls the world's smallest and lightest hand-
held blood pressure monitor.

The digital blood pressure monitor HEM-808F uses a small optical sensor
in a finger cuff to measure blood flow.  The cuff collapses into the
body of the device after use.  It measures only 9x6x3 cm - about the
size of a pack of cigarettes, so customers can carry it with them at
all times.

A company spokesman reports that Omron developed the product because
conventional models are too large for portability.  "Patients should be
able to take a reading whenever they feel the necessity to do so," the
spokesman said.

The company plans to launch the monitor in all major international
markets by end-1996, if the time required for satisfying local
regulations of each country permits.

Production of the HEM-808F is underway at Omron's plant in Mie
Prefecture, Japan.

SMARTLIGHT ATTRACTS INVESTMENT

HAIFA - A group of Israeli investors including the Walden Israel Fund,
the Mofet Fund, and Quantum and Evergreen, invested $1.6 million in
Smartlight, a high-tech medical device company.

Smartlight has developed a sophisticated light box that enhances the
reading of X-rays.  The system is based on electro-optics technology.

Dan Inbar, one of the company's founders and vice-president of research
and development, explained to MDBN that the light box extracts the
picture at a much deeper resolution than the standard light box used by
hospitals.  He says the box will greatly reduce the 30 per cent margin
of error currently found in radiological studies.

"We studied the psycho-physic limitations of the human eye and
developed a light box that works with those limitations," he said.

The light box was introduced last year in the US, "with great success",
said Mr Inbar.  The company, which plans to produce the product in
Israel, has already started to sell it in the southwest region of the
US and has further plans to expand in Europe.

This is the second time Walden has invested in Smartlight.  It now owns
a 12 per cent stake in the company.

EUROPEAN STANDARDS TRY TO BREAK LANGUAGE BARRIER

BRUSSELS- New European standards on the information to be provided by
manufacturers of medical devices and the graphical symbols which may be
used are expected to be published before the end of this year.  John
Webster, who chairs the European working group responsible for the
standards, believes the adoption of new symbols for use on medical
devices will greatly assist manufacturers in marketing their products
throughout Europe.

He says the European Committee on Standardisation (CEN) is likely to
adopt standardised symbols for "do not reuse" (the number 2 with a line
drawn through it), a "use by" symbol showing an egg timer, and other
symbols for sterile, date of manufacture, serial number and batch
number.

The new symbols are likely to be welcomed by an industry for which
language requirements are becoming an increasing burden.  More and more
European Union member states are insisting that devices be in local
language packaging.  Some countries which once accepted English, such
as Sweden and Norway, now require the instructions for use to be in
their own language.  Others are considering adding a second or third
language requirement.

Mr Webster says this causes problems for manufacturers, as some words
and phrases do not easily translate into other languages.  He believes
the new language requirements are pushing up the cost of medical
devices - at a time when governments are struggling to contain
healthcare costs.

EU SETS STANDARD CONDOM SIZE

BRUSSELS - Condoms marketed as contraceptives in the European Union
must meet the newly agreed common standard by June 1998, New Scientist
reports (2 March).  Under the new standard all condoms must be a
minimum of 170 millimetres in length.  They may be any width, but if
this differs from the "regular" width of 52 millimetres, the packaging
must say what the dimension is, and whether it is over or under the
regular width.

UK GROUP TO SHOW TECHNOLOGY OPPORTUNITIES TO US COMPANIES

LONDON - Officials of the County Durham Development Company (UK) met
with representatives of more than 25 Indiana-based medical device
manufacturers to encourage them to do business in the UK.

As part of the effort to attract US investment, the CDDC is sponsoring
a medical technology fair in late-May to show the US companies what
they have to offer.  The event, which will exhibit over 100 new medical
devices, will seek to license the inventions to medical device
manufacturers in the US and Europe.

Rob Allaker, international marketing executive for CDDC, told MDBN:
"The market is huge in Britain, the National Health Service imports 75
per cent of the medical devices it uses."

PRODUCT LIABILITY BILL HAS A CHANCE TO BECOME LAW

WASHINGTON, DC - The US Senate is expected to pass by end-March a
compromise bill that would reduce somewhat the potential legal
liability of companies selling medical devices in the US.  The House of
Representatives, however, has not yet scheduled a date for
consideration of the measure.

The compromise bill was worked out by a conference committee, composed
of members of the Senate and House.  That committee was charged with
resolving the major differences between the House bill that was highly
favourable to industry and the more narrow Senate bill that passed the
respective chambers last year.  If the compromise bill is passed by
Congress, it is expected to be signed into law by President Clinton.

Some good news for industry

The bill does provide some good news for the medical device industry,
although provisions most sought by the industry are missing.  The bill
severely limits the liability of biomaterial suppliers for injury from
a medical implant or device.  Biomaterial suppliers would be liable
only if a claimant establishes that the supplier failed to meet the
contract requirements or specifications for the implant, or failed to
properly register the implant with the secretary of Health and Human
Services.  In addition, the bill provides an expedited dismissal
procedure for medical device defendants.

Absent from the bill, however, is language that would bar those who
claim they were injured by medical devices from winning punitive
damages if the product had been approved for sale by a regulatory
agency except under extremely limited circumstances.  The legislation
does limit punitive awards assessed against those found liable in court
for selling products that injure consumers and ends joint and several
liability for injuries.  It also bars suits for products sold more than
20 years before the injury is claimed and gives consumers only two
years after they suffer an injury to claim damages.

In general, the cap on punitive damages is the greater of twice the
compensatory (economic and non-economic) damages, or $250,000.  This is
a cap that pre-empts state laws to the extent that they are more
permissive.  Moreover, sellers may not be held strictly liable or
liable on the basis of a breach of an implied warranty.  This bill
would also extend this standard to any entity that rents or leases a
product by providing that such an entity shall not be liable for the
act of another, solely by reason of ownership of such product, but
shall be liable under the same standards as applied to product sellers.

Actions for commercial loss are excluded from the scope of the bill.
Thus, the bill does not apply to a business seeking its lost profits if
a defective product causes a work stoppage.

The fact that the bill was near passage prompted consumer groups to
launch a last-minute public campaign to pressure members of Congress to
vote against it.  Officials of Citizens Action and the Consumers Union,
at a news conference on 7 March said: "The legislation would gut the
laws that now protect Americans from defective and dangerous products
and let manufacturers that put profit before safety get away with their
misconduct."

Steven Spiel, associate vice-president for policy and communications
for Health Industry Manufacturers Associations, however, said this is
not the case.  "This bill will do a great deal to encourage companies
to continue to invest in new innovative products for US patients and
will help keep jobs in the US as well.  In fact, this bill is great
news for consumers."

"It will only limit punitive damages, and it will eliminate the lottery-
like system which serves no one," Spiel said.  "In many instances, the
reward has little relationship to the damage alleged," he said.

FDA TO EASE RULES FOR LOW-RISK DEVICES

ROCKVILLE, MD - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is exempting
122 categories of low-risk medical devices from pre-market review,
adding to the 450 categories already exempted from such review.

The agency, in an "FDA Talk Paper", states this action is part of the
drug and medical device reforms announced last spring as contained in
the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review.  The agency
also said it is in line with its commitment to speed up patient access
to new medical devices.

The devices to be exempted from the review include: gas pressure
gauges, oxygen masks, pacemaker chargers, dental floss, pneumatic
tourniquets, patient scales, examination lights and therapeutic
massages.

These products will continue to be regulated by the FDA and remain
subject to good manufacturing practice regulation, FDA factory
inspections, and other general reports.  However, the exemption means
that manufacturers will be allowed to market the products without
getting prior clearance from the agency.

To exempt the products, the agency reclassified three categories of
devices from Class II (medium risk) to Class I (low risk).  In
addition, the agency exempted two categories of devices already in
Class I.  The medical devices amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act and FDA regulation allow certain types of Class I devices to be
exempted from pre-market review.

With this action, notes the FDA, nearly 75 per cent of all Class I
devices are now exempt from pre-market review.  This represents one-
third of all classified medical devices.

The final regulation listing the 122 exempted device categories became
effective on 15 February.  All manufacturers who had pre-clearance
submissions pending FDA review on 15 February should have been notified
by letter that their device is exempt.

Meanwhile, the FDA has just published a proposed rule in the 14 March
Federal Register for analyte specific reagents to be reclassified as
restricted devices.

1996 PASSAGE OF FDA REFORM BILL IN QUESTION

WASHINGTON, DC - Despite strong support from the US medical device
industry, it remains uncertain whether legislation mandating prompt
Food and Drug Administration action on applications for new device
approvals will win congressional support this year.  Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-Kansas) chairman of the Senate Labour and Human Resources
Committee, has called for a mark-up late this month on her FDA reform
bill, S.  1477.

Because of a heavy congressional schedule and the fact that it is a
presidential election year, some observers say the legislation will not
be passed.

Moreover, Representative Thomas Bliley (R-Virginia), chairman of the
House Commerce Committee, has yet to introduce his version of the FDA
reform bill, nor has he indicated when he could possibly introduce such
legislation.

Also, the opposition of FDA Commissioner David Kessler to the Kassebaum
bill has dampened its chances for passage.  In testimony before
Kassebaum's committee Mr Kessler said he backed the principles of the
Kassebaum bill, but called for changes in the legislation to ensure
safety.  He criticised key portions supported by the industry,
including provisions to set shorter timetables for approval of devices
and allowing third parties to take part in the review process.

Mr Kessler told the panel: "Improvements also have been made in the
timetable for the review and approval of medical devices.  With respect
to the 510(k) process, through which 98 per cent of all medical devices
evaluated by FDA reach the market, the average review time in fiscal
year 1995 was 137 days, down 24 per cent from the 184-day average in
fiscal year 1994.  The average review time for those devices needing
premarket applications is still too long, but we are making progress
there as well.  The average PMA review in fiscal year 1995 was 20
months."

Mr Kessler proposed to Congress on 12 March, that user fees be imposed
on the industry to permit the FDA to hire more people to expedite the
review of new products.  While several medical device companies favour
the fees, the two major trade associations representing large and small
manufacturers strongly oppose such action (the Health Industry
Manufacturers Association and the Medical Device Manufacturers
Association).

UNCERTAINTY OVER MRI ORDER

VANCOUVER - Ontario radiologists still hope that the Ontario government
will honour a promise to approve the addition of 23 more magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scanners to the province's present 12 in
service, even though the commitment dates back to November l994, before
the present provincial government was elected.  So far, the Health
Ministry has given no word.

Desmond Walker, president of the Ontario Association of Radiologists
said, "The approval of these MRI scanners would dramatically reduce the
nine-month waiting lists which are believed to be the longest in the
industrialised world." Turkey, he noted, has more MRI scanners per
million people than Canada does.

MEDICAL DEVICE MAKERS URGED TO LOOK EAST FOR NEW BUSINESS

WASHINGTON, DC - The US Commerce Department's export promotion
officials are telling US medical equipment makers to look to Asian
markets for medical devices.  Asian markets are growing at double-digit
rates, much faster than the traditional markets of North America,
Europe and Japan, reported the US Journal of Commerce.

Global trade patterns are shifting and "we are encouraging (the US)
industry to focus more on Asia" as well as Latin America, said Jeffrey
Gren, director of Commerce's Office of Microelectronics, Medical
Equipment and Instrumentation.

Besides supplying US medical device makers with market data, Commerce
officials help arrange trade missions, exhibits and seminars key to the
Asian market.  They also work directly with foreign governments to
improve market access.

The US represents roughly half of the world's $90 billion a year
medical device market, but its share is shrinking, as Asia and Latin
America's shares rise, Mr Gren said.

In China, said Commerce analyst Paul Barry, "We expect sales to
increase dramatically over the next couple of years", as China embarks
on a new five-year plan.

Help manufacturers cash in

To help US manufacturers cash in, Commerce is arranging a US visit by
members of the People's Liberation Army, which operates hundreds of
hospitals and thousands of clinics in China.

In May, a US medical-dental industry trade mission will visit China,
and in June, the United States plans to take part in a Beijing
International Medical Equipment Exhibition.

South Korea, Taiwan and India also are among other fast emerging Asian
markets.  Boosting US sales prospects, South Korea's Health Ministry is
due to announce guidelines simplifying its testing and other medical
device regulations.  Taiwan is moving to a "universal coverage" health
system, though it may soon issue new rules that could force down US
medical device prices.

In India, said a Commerce analyst, "we see rapid growth for high-end
medical products, such as diagnostic and imaging equipment".

TURKMENISTAN REQUIRES LICENSING OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT

ASHKHABAD - As part of its new healthcare reforms, Turkmenistan has
introduced new rules for registration of medical equipment and
pharmaceuticals.  Under the rules, implemented on 1 March, all
producers and suppliers of the medical equipment and pharmaceuticals
must register with a new department in the Health Ministry created for
this purpose.

Equipment without the proper registration and documentation are
prohibited from being imported to the country.  The licensing system is
part of the country's healthcare reform which started at the beginning
of this year.  Turkmenistan also introduced medical insurance in
January.

SECTOR TO SEE "MODEST GROWTH"

SYDNEY - The Medical Industry Association of Australia published its
industry analysis for 1994 in its annual survey: "Industry Survey
Number 4".

The analysis of industry trends is based on data from 33 companies.
Although the number of companies involved in the supply of medical
devices and diagnostics in Australia is thought to exceed 600, MIAA
says the 33 companies constitute, in terms of sales, the "core"
industry.

Companies engaged in local manufacture have experienced sharply
different trading conditions over the period to those engaged solely in
importing.  "Importers have experienced continuous and substantial
sales growth in both the domestic and re-export markets while local
manufacturers have faced little growth in domestic sales and widely
fluctuating export levels," reports MIAA.

Reflecting these contrasting market conditions, manufacturing (and
overall) employment levels contracted sharply, despite modest growth in
non-manufacturing staff numbers.

Sharp differences across the various segments of the domestic market
were seen in 1994, with growth rates in the private hospital sector far
outstripping those in the public hospital market.

The diagnostics sector of the industry would have felt the impact of
these market changes more severely than the devices sector, since the
bulk of diagnostics sales are concentrated in the slower-growing
segments of the market.

Because of the diversity of the results, MIAA says it is difficult to
predict the outlook for future growth, but the group says at best, the
outlook is for modest growth.

* Domestic sales to the public hospital sector remain the backbone of
the industry's activities, accounting for 46 per cent of total sales in
1994.

* The government currently finances around 44 per cent of all
expenditure on public hospitals; total Commonwealth outlays on hospital
services are projected to rise by only 12 per cent between 1994-95,
A$5.3 billion ($3.9 billion), and 1998-99, A$5.9 billion.

AUSTRALIA HELPS CHINA ESTABLISH AUDIOLOGY TECHNOLOGY COURSES

SYDNEY - Australia has agreed to help China establish audiology
training schools in the major teaching hospitals in Beijing and
Shanghai.  Each school will have a centre with facilities for assessing
hearing, fitting aids and making ear moulds.

Last year, representatives from three bodies, Australian Hearing
Services, Cochlear Pty Ltd, Ascom Audiosys, and a group of Australian
universities led by Macquarie University, met with Chinese officials to
set up a new cadre of Chinese ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists.
These specialists will train fellow ENT specialists in audiology using
the latest scientific devices and techniques.

A spokesman for Macquarie University said Australia would advise on
facilities, equipment and local staff, and the Chinese government would
pay for local costs.  Australia would also provide computer equipment
for programmable hearing aids and associated software for Australian-
made aids, he said.

Professor Philip Newall of Macquarie University commented: "Audiology
has developed rapidly with recent improvements in electronics, computer
science and technology.  It has become highly specialised in the West
with new branches such as clinical, paediatric, industrial, educational
and hearing-aid audiology.  Hearing devices too are increasingly
sophisticated.  As yet, there is no formal audiology school in China.
ENT departments in hospitals and rehabilitation centres fit mainly
children with hearing aids.  The rest of the population buys them
through department stores without testing or fitting."

Professor Newall is also closely associated with an increasing
Australian presence in audiology in Thailand.  "The Thai government is
providing hearing aids free of charge under a new law for the
disabled," he said.  "The initial contract is for 6,000 units, and it
is hoped some will be made in Australia and fit to Australian
specifications."

INCONTROL TO START CLINICAL TRIALS

BRUSSELS - InControl Inc (Europe operations, Belgium) has submitted its
application to European authorities to begin clinical implant trials of
the Metrix atrial defibrillation system in up to 12 selected centres in
Europe.  At the same time, the company has also submitted an
application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting
permission to start US trials.

Though implanted pacemakers have long been used to treat slow heart
rhythms and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are used to
treat ventricular fibrillation, the Metrix atrial defibrillator is one
of the first devices designed especially for patients with atrial
fibrillation.

Intended to be placed and programmed by physicians using techniques
similar to those used for implanting pacemakers, the Metrix atrial
defibrillator is designed to detect the presence of atrial fibrillation
and deliver a low-energy carefully-timed shock to convert the rhythm to
normal.

PORTABLE DIALYSIS MACHINE PROVES "SMOOTHER & GENTLER"

VANCOUVER - A nocturnal hemodialysis system has just completed two
years of clinical testing at Toronto's Wellesley Hospital.  The team
doing the test has recommended to the Ontario Health Ministry that the
treatment be made standard for patients requiring dialysis.

The modified dialysis machine was designed by Dr Robert Udall of
Toronto Western Hospital, with a grant from the Health Ministry.
Compared to conventional dialysis, which is done two or three times a
week for three or four hours, under nursing supervision, the operation
of the eight-hour-a-night dialyser is described as "smoother and
gentler".

The machine is linked by phone to a computerised monitoring station at
the hospital, and a technician calls the patient within two minutes of
any irregularity in its function.  In two years testing on six
patients, no emergency home visits were required.  The design of the
machine is presently being refined in order to make it more portable,
so that a patient could travel with it in his luggage.

Dr Andreas Pierratos, head of the Wellesley team, says that the new
nocturnal dialysis system will cost only $25,000 a year per patient,
half the annual cost of conventional dialysis.  With 9,000 patients in
Canada requiring such treatment, the cost savings would be
considerable.

ST JUDE MEDICAL AND HEARTPORT TO TEST MITRAL VALVE REPAIR SYSTEM

ST PAUL, MN - St Jude Medical Inc and Heartport Inc (Redwood City,
California) received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for
its human clinical trials of its port-access mitral valve repair and
replacement system.

The surgical system permits less invasive port-access heart valve
surgery to replace and repair diseased heart valves.  It has the
potential to reduce trauma, pain and debility that can result from
conventional open-chest surgery.  Additionally, side effects, recovery
time and hospital stays and costs are reduced.

The port-access procedure allows surgery to be performed through small
incisions or "ports" between the ribs.  The system promises to replace
the traditional procedure for mitral valve surgery of opening the chest
or "cracking" it by making a large incision, sawing the breastbone in
half and forcibly spreading open the rib cage with a steel retractor.
This conventional surgical procedure usually requires that patients
spend eight to 12 days in the hospital and an equal time for recovery
at home.

Mechanical heart valve system

The two companies have a worldwide agreement to develop products,
supply components, as well as to patent, license and sell them.  St
Jude will sell a new, jointly developed product, the St Jude Medical
Port-Access Mechanical Heart Valve System that incorporates Heartport
Port-Access Technology.

St Jude Medical has an exclusive licensing agreement with Professor
Jacques Seguin of France for a unique, semi-rigid annuloplasty ring, a
product used in the repair of diseased heart valves that is compatible
with Heartport's Port-Access system.

PERCLOSE TO START CLINICAL TRIALS

MENLO PARK, CA - Perclose Inc has completed enrolling 500 randomly
selected patients for its Investigational Device Exemption trial for
the Prostar 9F and 11F Percutaneous Vascular Surgical systems.  The
company also announced that the initial human clinical testing of the
single suture Techstar 7F system has been completed and has validated
the device's safety and efficacy for human use.

The Prostar 9F and 11F are minimally invasive surgical systems used to
close arterial access sites following therapeutic catherisation
procedures, such as angioplasty and stenting.

Economic benefits

Hank Plain, Perclose's president and chief executive officer, said: "We
believe that the Prostar system provides patients with significant
clinical and economic benefits, including more rapid achievement of
hemostasis, reduced time to ambulation and increased patient comfort."

The Techstar 7F system was clinically tested and evaluated following
therapeutic and diagnostic coronary procedures in Canada.  Plain notes
that the Techstar system is offered in 6F, 7F and 8F sizes providing
physicians with a complete line of arterial access site management
devices that address the full range of clinical needs and physicians'
size preferences.

The company plans to begin marketing the system during the second
quarter 1996 in Europe, Japan and Canada.

IDS TO CLINICALLY TEST CTLM

SUNRISE, FL - Imaging Diagnostic System Inc has received approval from
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin clinical testing of
its Computed Tomography Laser Mammography (CTLM).

CTLM represents a painless and radiation free alternative to
traditional mammography.  The machine uses a high-speed laser and
sophisticated computer technology to produce ultra sharp three-
dimensional, cross-sectional images of the breasts, without discomfort
from breast compression.

The clinical trials under the FDA's Investigational Device Exemption
application will begin at the Strax Breast Institute in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida and will be expanded this year to screening
facilities at cancer detection centres across the US.

Dr Richard J Grable, chief executive officer and inventor of the
technology, said: "When the FDA granted a prompt review of our
applications, we were excited.  But now we're ecstatic it has resulted
in the FDA's first acceptance of clinical trials using our medical
optical imaging." The company projects more than $5 million in sales
this year in fulfilling orders from the Far East, Middle East and
Europe.

SLIGHT RISK FROM BREAST IMPLANTS

CHICAGO, IL - The largest study to-date on the health risks associated
with breast implants shows that women with implants are 24 per cent
more likely to self-report connective-tissue diseases than women who
have never had breast implants, according to an article in the late-
February issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

The researchers noted: "The data from this large retrospective cohort
study are compatible with previous recent reports from two other cohort
studies that provide reassuring evidence against a large hazard of
breast implants on connective tissue diseases." However, they also
indicate a small but significant increased risk of ...  any connective
tissue disease."

The researchers found the small increased risk remained virtually
constant regardless of the woman's age or how long she had the implant.

Connective tissue diseases are a group of disorders associated with
abnormality of the immune system in which the body reacts against its
own cells, tissues and organs.  The researchers found the increased
risk was of borderline statistical significance for rheumatoid
arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome (a condition where the eyes and mouth
become excessively dry), polymyositis or dermatomyositis (a rare,
sometimes fatal disease in which the muscles and skin become inflamed,
causing muscle weakness and a skin rash) and scleroderma (a rare
condition that can affect many organs and tissues of the body).

Dr Charles Hennekens, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Massachusetts, and colleagues analysed questionnaires
completed by 395,543 female health professionals.  A total of 10,830
women reported they had breast implants and 11,805 reported they had
one of more connective tissue diseases between 1962 and 1991.

In 1992, the US Food and Drug Administration imposed a moratorium on
the use of silicone breast implants until their safety could be proved;
however, they are still available under clinical trials and women can
still get saline implants.

The results of the study are in line with FDA commissioner David
Kessler's testimony to Congress last year that the risk of getting a
serious disease from the implants is minimal.

The researchers noted: "Further research is necessary before firm
conclusions can be drawn.

The study was partially funded by former implant manufacturer Dow
Corning Corp.

IT TO CAPITALISE ON EXPERTISE IN POLYMER-BASED PRODUCTS

CHESHIRE UK - The implantable and extracorporeal devices sector provides
a $12 billion opportunity for sales of biomaterials, an area that has a
worldwide growth potential estimated at 7-12 per cent per annum.  This
market provides the Innovative Technologies (IT) Group with a huge
potential for capitalising on its research and development expertise in
alginate and polymer-based woundcare and medical products.

IT is aiming to establish itself as a"one-stop shop" for advanced
woundcare products and other medical devices based on its polymer
technology and to continue to gain market share as a supplier of
materials and manufacturing process technology.  Though IT's sales
focus at present is on alginate and polymer film-based woundcare
products, the company envisages a future in fields as far reaching as
self-lubricating hip joints, heart-assist devices, catheters, medical
and clean room gloves, condoms, and drug delivery.  In a number of
these areas IT is already involved in research with industry partners
including PharmaPlast AS (Norway), Nycomed AS (Norway) and Portex Ltd
(UK).  It is also carrying out research through the UK Department of
Trade and Industry LINK-funded programmes.

IT's core expertise in alginate and polymer woundcare products has
resulted in the development of tailor-made products for all categories
of wounds at various stages of healing.  The company quotes figures
which estimate the worldwide woundcare market to be some $9 billion,
with a hi-tech segment approaching $2 billion and growing at over 20
per cent annually.

Managing costs of healthcare

Managing the costs of healthcare is an increasing priority in any
number of medical fields, and to this end IT believes it can make
"unusually cost-effective" alginate and film dressings.  This is partly
possible through the ability of "intelligent film" to manage wound
fluid, resulting in a dressing which needs changing less frequently,
saving nursing time and therefore money.  Results so far suggest that
these dressings can be left in place for up to seven days.  To-date,
the design and development of a wide range of woundcare products has
been completed, including film, alginate, hydrocolloid, hydrogel and
special gauze dressings.  The company does not sell under its own label
but designs, develops, produces and manufactures for major companies
with "significant sales teams".

Focused research has been one of the keys to IT's success, financial
director David Chellingsworth maintains.  But there is also "a lot
bubbling beneath the surface".  Although the bottom line is to generate
revenues and profits for shareholders (the company was listed on the
USM in 1994, and now - as of a couple of weeks ago - on the London
Stock Exchange) it is important "not to lose track of the fact that you
must not stifle the creativity that lies beneath the surface".  (In
fact, IT's polymer technology does not stop at medical products, and
its offshoot textiles group is forming alliances with the aim to
develop waterproof, breathable textiles through the use of its
superurethane films as fabric coatings).

Unique position

IT also believes it has the potential to become one of the lowest-cost
producers of finished woundcare products, especially as alginate and
polysaccharide wound dressing manufacture has been integrated in house.
 The company sees itself "in a unique position" within the industry,
with fully integrated manufacturing capabilities for films, from
polymer design to finished products, including the facility to convert
and package many woundcare products, such as hydrocolloids and
hydrogels.

With major sales being generated by its line of "basic" alginate
dressings, the company has major clients in Europe and North America.
New products are planned for launch in the first half of 1996.  The
woundcare market is still open to innovation and new ideas, David
Chellingsworth suggests, with many more niches to explore.  IT has the
facilities and expertise to further develop any viable ideas brought to
the company from third parties.  The company recently invested in its
own leading edge conversion capability with laminating and packaging
facilities.  (The US market for custom conversion of non-woundcare
medical devices, excluding drug delivery patches, is $50 million, IT
claims).

The order books are filling steadily, David Chellingsworth says.
According to IT's chairman in his interim report at the end of last
year, the aim is to achieve annual sales in the order of #10 million
($15.9 million) within two years.  Though IT is quite a small company
(of some 80 individuals in total), it is targeting a fairly large
market with "top of the range" products.  Even a year or so ago there
was little to show in terms of sales, and no major contracts had been
signed.  Things have progressed a long way since then.

DEVICES SECTOR SETS SIGHTS ON MARKET AND INDICATION EXPANSION

LONDON - LocalMed, a California-based private medical devices company,
recently completed a $16 million private placement of preferred stock.
As lead investor, International Biotechnology Trust invested $3
million.  Hambrecht & Quist and Johnson & Johnson Development Capital
also participated in the preferred stock offering.

LocalMed markets devices which are used, in conjunction with balloon
catheters, to deliver drugs locally during angioplasty.  Its
InfusaSleeve system received FDA 510(k) approval in late-1994 and is
marketed by a direct sales force in the US and by distributors in the
rest of the world.  The local drug delivery catheter is used in
conjunction with a standard PTCA balloon catheter to deliver drugs to
the coronary arteries during angioplasty, effectively converting the
PTCA catheter into the drug delivery device.  LocalMed, founded in
1993, is developing other devices which will be used during cardiac
surgery.

Medtronic announced late-February that its Hemopump Cardiac Assist
System is being released to the cardiac surgery market in Germany and
on a limited basis to customers in other parts of Europe.  The Hemopump
is a catheter-mounted left ventricular assist system designed to
augment cardiac output.  The company is progressing toward US
regulatory approval to resume a modified clinical trial focusing on the
Hemopump's effectiveness during coronary bypass procedures.  Trials are
expected to take place during the 1997 fiscal year.

Keen support from city analysts

UK-based Cortecs, a biopharmaceutical company keenly supported by
several city analysts, hopes to launch before the end of the year a
simple rapid testing kit for osteoporosis.Analysts estimate the
potential size of the worldwide market for a diagnostic kit for
osteoporosis at up to $1 billion, three times bigger than that for any
other diagnostic product currently being sold.  A working prototype has
been established in collaboration with Danish company Osteometer
Biotech AS, and trials are expected to commence over the next three
months.  Cortecs took just eight months from the date of signing the
deal to create a working prototype.

Osteometer originated the bone breakdown technology, which Cortecs
secured access to last year through an exclusive licensing agreement.
The product has in recent studies been shown to be the only bone marker
which is predictive of hip fractures.

Combining diagnostics with therapeutics in a single disease area
provides enormous leverage when it comes to negotiating future
distribution and detail sales force arrangements.  Jonathan Pockson,
finance director of Cortecs, told MDBN: "If we can have a diagnostic
kit for osteoporosis, plus an oral version of calcitonin to handle the
disease, then effectively Cortecs will have a very strong control of
the disease state in a massive field.  It represents a significant
opportunity for the company and represents a follow on product from our
enabling technology.  "

Helisal, the company's recently-launched H.pylori diagnostic, is
proceeding as the company forecast.  Approval from the FDA is believed
to be imminent.  It is gradually building momentum in Europe as part of
H.pylori eradication therapy; H.pylori is a bacteria linked to stomach
ulcers, cancer and heart disease.  The results from the Phase II
studies of oral calcitonin are expected soon.  Cortecs posted "solid
all around progress" in its interim financial reports posted on 11
March, said the company.  It hopes to post profits in 1997.

International demand to grow quickly

California-based Microbics Corp, which develops and markets biosensor-
based systems for monitoring toxicity in environmental and process
control markets, is looking to raise about $20 million to fund the
expansion of sales and marketing and to support new systems
development.  International demand for toxicity testing is expected to
grow quickly over the next five years.

The anticipated pre-money valuation of $40 million offers considerable
upside for a company with forecast net earnings in excess of $20
million in 2001.  The company plans to move its headquarters to the UK,
with a full flotation on the London stock market in early 1998.

Shield Diagnostics expects within the next month to announce
preliminary data from the current Houston-based trials on its lab-based
test (AFT), for activated factor 12 a diagnostic test to predict
susceptibility to coronary heart disease.  Market estimates put the
market for such a test at between #50 and #100 million.  Further
product enhancements are likely, perhaps with a rapid assay test for
point-of-care use.

IL JUDGE DISMISSES PEDICLE SCREW CASE AS IMPERMISSIBLE

         In dismissing a complaint filed on behalf of 11 plaintiffs
who alleged injuries from implanted spine plate pedicle screws, a
federal judge in Chicago called the suit "an impermissible
lumping together of plaintiffs and defendants" and said the
claims must be filed separately.  Jarmasek et al. v. AcroMed
Corp. et al., No. 95-C-7095 (ND IL, Eastern Div.).

         "It simply will not do for counsel to put together this type
of hodgepodge in anticipation that it may be worked into
respectable size and shape through the efforts of the court or
opposing counsel or both," said Senior U.S. District Judge Milton
I. Shadur of the Northern District of Illinois.

         In his Dec. 6 order, Judge Shadur dismissed the suit with
leave for the plaintiffs to refile an amended complaint by
Dec. 19.  According to court records, an amended and restated
complaint was filed by the plaintiffs on Dec. 14.

         Joseph J. Jarmasek and 10 other plaintiffs filed a complaint
on Dec. 5, alleging that AcroMed Corp. and 99 other defendants
were responsible for injuries allegedly sustained from implanted
pedicle screws.

         "All 11 plaintiffs have a common grievance: the implanting
of a spine plate pedicle screw," Judge Shadur said.  "But of
course the several implant operations were performed at different
times and almost without exception at different hospitals."

         The judge criticized several problems in the complaint,
including the plaintiffs' engagement "in a type of boilerplate
rote repetition of allegations about defendants' purported
contacts with this district that seems very likely to be
demonstratably false."  The ability to obtain personal
jurisdiction over many of the defendants is extremely doubtful,
Judge Shadur said.

         "In addition, the inclusion in this action of some of the
categories of joined defendants (particularly, though not
exclusively, the individual defendants) would seem highly
problematic as they relate to any of the plaintiffs (and perhaps
as to all of them)," the judge said.
                   He said the litigation must be reduced to manageable
proportions in compliance with the rules of the court, and must
be supported by allegations that will be able to pass the
objective good faith standard of Rule 11.

         Representing the plaintiffs were Mark E. Stone of Kurasch &
Stone in Chicago; John J. Cummings III of Cummings, Cummings &
Dudenhefer in New Orleans, LA; and Cary Michael Saperstein of the
Law Office of Michael D. Mannis in Chicago.

PLAINTIFFS ASK PA JUDGE TO DENY DISMISSAL OF CLAIMS

         Nine plaintiffs in the orthopedic bone screw multidistrict
litigation in Philadelphia asked Senior U.S. District Judge Louis
C. Bechtle on Dec. 5 to deny a motion by defendant AcroMed Corp.
to dismiss their claims based on alleged noncompliance with
Pretrial Order No. 6.  In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products
Liability Litigation, No. 1014 (J.P.M.L.).

         On Nov. 22, AcroMed moved the court to dismiss the claims of
nearly 600 plaintiffs, including William E. Biddle Jr., Cynthia
L. Glenn, Mattie Tripp Johnson, Maureen Leckie, Ann F. Little,
Bradley J. Little, Patricia Harper Whitley, Dan K. Whitley and
Johnny W. Taylor.

         In its motion, the company asserted that the plaintiffs were
compelled by Pretrial Order No. 6 to submit completed
questionnaires providing basic background and authorization to
enable defendants to obtain medical records within 60 days of
receiving the order.

         The plaintiffs argued in their response that each plaintiff
complied, in good faith, with the requirements of Pretrial Order
No. 6.

         "AcroMed believes that its interests in this litigation are
best served by seeking the wholesale dismissal of plaintiffs'
claims based upon any possible deficiency that AcroMed can point
to with respect to Plaintiffs' compliance with Pretrial Order
No. 6," the response stated.

         The plaintiffs are represented by John P. Kopesky of
Sheller, Ludwig & Badey in Philadelphia.  AcroMed is represented
by Richard I. Werder Jr. of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in
Cleveland.

multidistrict litigation in Philadelphia, according to the sixth
bi-weekly report filed Dec. 11 by the defense liaison counsel.
In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products Liability Litigation,
No. 1014 (J.P.M.L.).

         The report, filed pursuant to Pretrial Order No. 68, details
each of the 10 defendant manufacturers in the multidistrict
litigation and the number of depositions taken, rescheduled or
dismissed/canceled.

         According to the two-page report, the depositions were taken

COURT STAYS NOTICE PENDING MOTION TO RECONSIDER CERTIFICATION

         Senior U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel on Dec. 15
ordered that the notice to class participants in the Telectronics
Pacing Systems, Inc. litigation in Ohio be stayed pending the
resolution of the defendant's motion to reconsider the court's
order certifying the class.  In re Telectronics Pacing Systems,
Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" Leads Products Liability Litigation,
No. 1057 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV95-87 (SD OH).

         Judge Spiegel on Nov. 17 granted a motion to certify a class
of plaintiffs who claimed they were injured as a result of
allegedly defective pacemaker "J" lead wires.  In his order, the
judge granted certification on four of the plaintiffs' 11 causes
of action that stem from allegedly defective Telectronics Pacing
Systems Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" pacemaker leads that were
implanted into the plaintiffs.

         The plaintiffs assert that about 15% of the company's
pacemaker leads are J-shaped in design.  Telectronics had used
the J-shaped lead since December 1987 for pacemakers that are
specifically designed to stimulate muscle in the atrium of the
heart.

         The plaintiffs alleged that from December 1987 to October
1994, Telectronics manufactured and sold its pacemakers, a
significant portion of which contained defective leads, on a
continuous basis.  According to the plaintiffs, about 40,500 of
the company's J-leads were implanted into patients worldwide.

         Judge Spiegel ordered the plaintiffs to file their response
to Telectronics' motion by Jan. 2, and Telectronics to reply
before Jan. 9.  A hearing regarding the motion to reconsider
class certification has been scheduled for Jan. 26.

         The plaintiffs are represented by Louis Gilligan of Keating,
Muething & Klekamp in Cincinnati; and by Stanley M. Chesley and
Terrence L. Goodman of Waite, Schneider, Bayless & Chesley Co.,
L.P.A., also in Cincinnati.

         Telectronics is represented by Frank C. Woodside III and
James A. Comodeca of Dinsmore & Shohl in Cincinnati; and by
Charles P. Goodell Jr., Richard M. Barnes and Ian Gallagher of
Goodell, DeVries, Leech & Gray in Baltimore.

TELECTRONICS SAYS NAMES OF CLASS MEMBERS SHOULD BE KEPT PRIVATE

         In a Dec. 4 plan for notice of the pendency of the class
action, defendant Telectronics Pacing Systems, Inc. objected to
the plaintiffs' provision to provide the Plaintiffs' Steering
Committee with computer disks and labels identifying the names
and addresses of all class members in its possession.  In re
Telectronics Pacing Systems, Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" Leads
Products Liability Litigation, No. 1057 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV95-87
(SD OH).

         In its plan for notice of the pendency of the class action,
Telectronics said it must operate under the regulatory
requirements of the Food and Drug Administration, which requires
that patient names and addresses be kept confidential and be
protected from public disclosure.

         As an alternative to the plaintiffs' proposal, Telectronics
proposed that it produce a list identifying all patient names and
addresses under seal to the court, which would prepare the
notification for mailing to the class members.

         "In this manner, the confidentiality of the patient records
can be preserved, while at the same time notifying members of the
class of the pendency of this class action," Telectronics said.

         Translations of the class notice and press releases should
be made " at the plaintiffs' expense " in order to adequately
inform members of this world-wide class who live in predominately
non-English speaking countries, Telectronics said.  Those
countries include Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Japan, Italy,
Belgium, Jordan, Iran, Iraq and Mexico.

NORPLANT PLAINTIFFS, DEFENDANTS ARGUE ON MEDICAL MONITORING

         In response to U.S. District Judge Richard A. Schell's order
regarding medical monitoring, plaintiffs and defendants in the
Norplant multidistrict litigation argued on the issue of medical
monitoring as a viable cause of action.  In re Norplant
Contraceptive Products Liability Litigation, No. 1038 (J.P.M.L.).

         Judge Schell on Sept. 25 ordered the parties involved in the
Norplant litigation to brief whether each state would recognize a
claim for medical monitoring and what physical injury information
would be required in order to bring such a claim.

         In a Nov. 30 brief, the plaintiffs argued that medical
monitoring is a viable cause of action and that every
jurisdiction would recognize medical monitoring as a recoverable
element of damages.

         "Although some jurisdictions require an existing physical
injury to warrant medical monitoring, that factor is present in
every plaintiff by virtue of the fact that mere use of Norplant
requires invasive surgical procedures to both insert and remove
the product," the plaintiffs said.

         The plaintiffs urged the court to follow In re Paoli R.R.
Yard PCB Litigation, 916 F.2d 829 (3rd Cir. 1990), cert. denied,
499 U.S. 961 (1991), and In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litigation, 35
F.3d 829 (3rd Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 1253 (1995).
In those cases, the plaintiffs said, the courts held that medical
monitoring is a viable cause of action.

         Another case cited by the plaintiffs is In re Telectronics
Pacing Systems, Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" Leads Products Liability
Litigation, No. 1057 (J.P.M.L.).  In Telectronics, the plaintiffs
contended in a footnote to their brief, the judge certified
medical monitoring as a separate class without making any
distinction between the laws of the various jurisdictions.

         The plaintiffs maintained that the court must analyze each
legal issue individually to determine which state has the "most
significant relationship" to each claim.  The places where the
individual plaintiffs were injured do not play a major role, the
plaintiffs said, because where the plaintiffs were injured is
unrelated to the defendant's conduct, which occurred in
Pennsylvania.

         Defendant Wyeth Laboratories developed, tested, marketed and
placed the Norplant contraceptive into the stream of commerce in
Pennsylvania, the plaintiffs said.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs
said, Pennsylvania has the greatest number of relevant contacts
with the litigation.

         "In this case, virtually every act conducted by Wyeth which
renders it legally liable for the claims brought by the
plaintiffs occurred in Pennsylvania," the brief stated.  "Thus,
in accord with the choice of law in this jurisdiction, the Court
should select the law of Pennsylvania to uniformly govern
plaintiffs' medical monitoring claims."

         In support of medical monitoring relief, the plaintiffs said
they are suffering from physical symptoms such as excessive
menstrual bleeding, recurrent headaches, weight gain, hair loss,
depression and mood swings.  The plaintiffs said they are
concerned about other long-term medical problems that they may be
experiencing that cannot be detected without medical monitoring.

         "The acceptance of medical monitoring as a separate claim
for relief is the trend in the law and is clearly the law in
Pennsylvania, the principal place of business of Wyeth
Laboratories and the state which has the most significant
contacts with this litigation," the plaintiffs said.

         On the other hand, the defendants argued in their brief that
no law exists in the majority of the jurisdictions of the
plaintiffs in the Norplant multidistrict litigation that touches
upon the issue of medical monitoring.  The defendants argued that
the court must answer no for those class members from
jurisdictions that have not recognized medical monitoring as an
independent tort.

         After the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' decision
recognizing a cause of action for medical monitoring in Paoli,
the defendants argued, another Pennsylvania court rejected the
Third Circuit's ruling.  In Addams v. Westinghouse Electric
Corp., No. 1340 C.D. 1988, slip op. at 16 (PA C.P. Ct., Mercer
Cty., July 30, 1993), the court held that "an action for medical
monitoring is inappropriate."

         "For this Court in this case to recognize a cause of action
for medical monitoring in 31 jurisdictions would be to replicate
these other courts' errors in a far grander scale," the
defendants maintained.

         The defendants argued that a nationwide Norplant class
action predicated upon state law claims such as medical
monitoring would be unmanageable and "would constitute an
unwarranted intrusion by a federal court into areas best left to
local courts resolving individual actions."

         "This problem " how to intuit and then apply the law of 64
jurisdictions " demonstrates that there is something
fundamentally wrong with the course plaintiffs would have this
Court chart," the defendants said.

         The court should deny the plaintiffs' request for class
certification prior to ruling on the defendants' motion to
dismiss, thereby eliminating the need to create the law for the
31 jurisdictions that never have addressed the issue of medical
monitoring, the defendants concluded.

         The plaintiffs' brief was submitted by Christopher M. Parks
of Parker, Parks & Rosenthal, L.L.P. in Port Arthur, TX.  The
defendants' brief was submitted by Lawrence Germer and Paul Gertz
of Germer & Gertz in Beaumont, TX; and by John W. Vardaman, F.
Lane Heard III and Steven M. Farina of Williams & Connolly in
Washington, DC.

TRANSFER OF NONDEBTOR CASES OPPOSED BY TX PLAINTIFFS, MS DOCTORS

         Breast implant plaintiffs from Johnson County, TX, and a
consortium of physicians from Mississippi late last month filed
with the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals their briefs
opposing the challenge of the nondebtor defendant-appellants of a
district court finding that breast implant claims against the
nondebtors are not related to the Dow Corning Corp. Chapter 11
case.  In re Dow Corning Corp.; Lindsey v. O'Brien, Tanski,
Tanser and Young et al., Nos. 95-2034, 95-2106, 95-2082, 95-2084,
and 95-2107 (6th Cir.).

         The appellees contend that U.S. District Judge Denise Page
Hood did not err in ruling that the jurisdiction of her court is
limited to only those cases that are related to the core
bankruptcy proceeding.  The district court properly held that
because the appellees' state law claims against the nondebtors
would not affect the administration of the bankruptcy estate, it
did not have jurisdiction to hear those actions under 28 U.S.C.
Section 1334(b), the appellees said.

         At issue is Judge Hood's Sept. 12 memorandum opinion and
order in which she held that her court does not have jurisdiction
over breast implant claims against nondebtor defendants.  Claims
against nondebtor defendants are not "related to" the Dow Corning
bankruptcy, the judge said, citing to Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins, 743
F.2d 984, 994 (3rd Cir. 1984).

         Citing again to Pacor, Judge Hood noted the similarity of
the cases and held that "there will be no contingent claim by the
Shareholders against the debtor for indemnification until such
time as a judgment is rendered and, then, the non-debtors would
still have to proceed with an entirely separate proceeding in
order to obtain indemnification from the Debtor under 11 U.S.C.
Section 502.  Joint tortfeasors are not indispensable parties in
the federal forum.  The Bankruptcy forum provides for a mechanism
to resolve the debtor's liability for indemnification should a
judgment be rendered against the Shareholders."

         The appellants contend that the judge's holding that she
lacks jurisdiction over breast implant claims against the
shareholders under 28 U.S.C. Section 1334(b) is "clearly wrong."
The Sixth Circuit has often found that "related to" jurisdiction
under Section 1334(b) is fairly broad and that jurisdiction
exists if the claims at issue may "conceivably" affect the
bankruptcy estate, the appellants said.

Mississippi Physicians

         The Mississippi Physicians argued that the appellants have
failed to show that judicial economy would be served by the
district court's retaining jurisdiction over the cases at issue.
Judge Hood properly decided that the district court need only
concern itself with the cases that are central to the
administration of the Dow Corning bankruptcy estate, the
appellees said.

         "The claims by the Plaintiffs against the Non-Debtor
Defendants for indemnification and/or for joint and severed
liability with Dow Corning are contingent," the appellees said.
"It is unnecessary to join all tortfeasors in one action.  There
is no evidence of the impact the state court litigation will have
on Dow Corning's bankruptcy estate.  Accordingly, this Court has
no interest in the state court litigation in which any proceeding
against Dow Corning is stayed by virtue of 11 U.S.C. Section
362."

         Further, the Mississippi Physicians said, "[s]ince the opt-
out cases are stayed as against Dow Corning, the bankruptcy
estate will not incur litigation costs, nor should any judgment
in favor of Plaintiffs against the Non-Debtor manufacturer
Defendants be binding on the Debtor or incur a cost to the
estate.  These cases are unrelated to the bankruptcy case, and
not subject to removal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1452.  Thus,
this Court should affirm the District Court's ruling that it had
no jurisdiction over the Non-Debtor's claims."

Johnson County Plaintiffs

         "The arguments of the Third Party Nondebtors that the claims
against them are 'related to' Dow Corning's bankruptcy are simply
disingenuous," the Johnson County plaintiffs argued.  "First, the
Third Party Nondebtors argue that the claims against them, if
allowed to proceed, will undermine Dow Corning's bankruptcy case.
However, the arguments offered in support of this allegation,
namely, their common law right of contribution from Dow Corning,
are without merit.  Indeed, the Third Party Nondebtors failed to
present any evidence to the District Court of even one single
case in any forum anywhere in the United States in which any of
the Nondebtors have filed a cross-claim against Dow Corning for
contribution, even though thousands of cases have been pending
against those same Third Party Nondebtors for almost four years!"

         The plaintiffs went on to argue that "[a]lthough there may
exist shared facts in cases against Dow Corning and those
asserted against the Third Party Nondebtors..., the plaintiffs in
the underlying state court proceedings have alleged that the
liability is joint and several, thus providing an independent
basis of liability as to the Third Party Nondebtors....  The only
possible effect the estate may sustain in the present proceeding
is the speculative diminution of potential estate assets by
virtue of the utilization of insurance defense proceeds."

         The Mississippi Physicians are represented by Chris J.
Walker, Delia Y. Robinson and J. Hale Freeland of Markow, Walker,
Reeves & Anderson, P.A. in Jackson, MS.

         The Johnson County plaintiffs are represented by Daniel W.
McDonald of McDonald, Clay & Crow, L.L.P. in Fort Worth; J. Mark
Howell and J. Kevin Clark of Clark & Howell in Fort Worth; Frank
Cain of Bowers & Cain in Fort Worth; Michael P. McGartland of

Law Offices of Ben C. Martin in Dallas; and Russell L. Munsch and

LAWYER NOT REQUIRED TO ANSWER SETTLEMENT QUESTIONS, COURT RULES

         A lawyer for Dow Corning Corp. is not required to answer the
Tort Claimants Committee's questions about whether the debtor
believes the amounts of settlements with breast implant
plaintiffs are reasonable, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J.
Spector ruled Dec. 1.  In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512
(ED MI Bankr.).

         The Tort Claimants Committee is conducting a Rule 2004
examination of debtor Dow Corning Corp. (DCC).  The committee
asked DCC's managing trial counsel, Douglas Schoettinger, whether
he had any reason to believe that the amounts for which DCC
settled some 200 breast implant claims were not reasonable.
Schoettinger said yes, but then refused to provide further
information, invoking the work product privilege and attorney-
client privilege.  The committee sought to compel him to provide
further information, but Judge Spector denied the request.

         He said the committee failed to show that it could not
obtain the information from other sources.  Judge Spector also
found that DCC had not waived the privilege merely by saying it
had reason to believe the settlement amounts were unreasonable.

         "The Debtor has given no clear indication, nor do I see any
reason to assume, that it will be using privileged information in
an attempt to prove that the agreements are unreasonable," he
said.  "Thus there is no justification for making a finding of
waiver based on the 'truth-garbling' rationale.  One could posit
numerous ways in which the reasonableness of the settlements
could be determined through the use of objective, non-privileged
information."

CIBA IMPROPERLY LABELED CONTACT LENS SOLUTION, APPELLANT ARGUES

         Ciba Vision Corp., knowing that its AOSEPT contact lens
solution had been injuring hundreds of consumers, failed to
comply with Food and Drug Administration regulations that
required "common sense" in deciding to strengthen its product
warnings/labels, appellant Leslie Scott contended in reply to
Ciba's answer to her petition for review by the California
Supreme Court.  Scott v. Ciba Vision Corp., No. S049608 (CA Sup.
Ct.).

         Scott argued that she received no advance warning through a
consent form of the danger of misidentification of the product
containers of Ciba's AOSEPT solution, which contains hydrogen
peroxide, and saline solution.

         Scott brought suit against Ciba, alleging claims of strict
liability, negligence, failure to provide adequate warnings and
breach of implied warranty.  She claimed she had difficulty in
distinguishing Ciba's AOSEPT solution from its saline solution.
As a result of the indistinguishable bottles, Scott said she
suffered chemical burns to her eyes when she rinsed her contacts
in the AOSEPT solution.

         Around the time of her injury, Scott said, Ciba began to
market its AOSEPT solution with a red cap, but also continued to
market it in the old bottle, knowing that persons not wearing
their contact lenses would have trouble in distinguishing the two
bottles.

         The Santa Clara County Superior Court granted Ciba's motion
for summary judgment, finding that Scott's claims were preempted
by the Medical Devices Amendments (MDA) to the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act.  On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Sixth
District, affirmed the trial court.

         Scott petitioned the state Supreme Court for review, arguing
that the only other state Supreme Court that has addressed the
issue of federal preemption of Class III devices concluded that
the plaintiff's claims were not preempted (Larsen v. Pacesetter
Systems, Inc. [Hawaii 1992], 837 P.2d 1273, 1281).

         In response, Ciba argued that approved labels and warnings
on medical devices are "specific requirements" of federal law
that preempt causes of action brought under state law.  The
company maintained that the appellate court's ruling was aligned
with a majority of jurisdictions that have held that federal law
preempts causes of action brought under state law.

         In her Nov. 27 reply, Scott said the Court of Appeals cited
two cases in its decision that are not relevant to this case.  In
Evraets v. Intermedics Intraocular, Inc. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th
779, and Powers v. Optical Radiation Corp. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th
1444, the cases involved experimental products for which adequate
warnings were not yet known, Scott said.
                   Ciba's statements that this case is a "pure label and
warning case" and that Scott "makes no claim for any defect in
the design" are disingenuous and completely inaccurate, Scott
argued.

         "Respondent is well aware that Leslie Scott claims that the
design of the two virtually indistinguishable white product
containers containing harmful and harmless ingredients
respectively are defective under both negligence and strict
liability theories," she stated.

         The reply was submitted by Jonathan D. Gordon of the Law
Offices of Jonathan D. Gordon in Pleasant Hill, CA.

SUIT ALLEGING MALFUNCTIONING PENILE IMPLANT IS SETTLED

         Noting that the case has been settled, U.S. District Judge
Jan E. DuBois of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania last month
dismissed as moot motions for and against summary judgment in a
personal injury action brought by an Arizona resident for
injuries allegedly sustained after surgical implantation of an
inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP).  Werner v. American Medical
Systems Inc. et al., No. 95-1856 (ED PA).

         Plaintiff James Werner received the implant on March 5,
1992, in an operation at a hospital in Harrisburg, PA.  Following
the surgery, Werner allegedly experienced side effects.  On
March 25, 1993, an attempt to remove an infected prosthesis was
unsuccessful.  Subsequently, a diagnosis of an infected
prosthesis was made, and another operation was performed to
remove it.  After the operation, the plaintiff was told he could
not receive an implant of a properly functioning prosthesis,
rendering him permanently impotent.

         In their motion for summary judgment, defendants American
Medical Systems Inc. and Pfizer Inc. argued that Werner knew of
his injury and its cause more than two years before he initiated
his suit.  Werner, on the other hand, argued that the statute of
limitations had been tolled by certification of a class action
suit in the Southern District of Ohio against American Medical
Systems and Pfizer Inc. concerning similar allegations involving
their IPP, and that claims of negligent design and strict
liability could proceed in any event because neither the Medical
Devices Amendments nor the Food and Drug Administration had
imposed specific design requirements on the device.

         Werner was represented by John P. Kopesky of Sheller, Ludwig
& Badey in Philadelphia.  The defendants were represented by John
W. Frazier, Richard G. Placey and Sally Ackerman King of
Montgomery, McCracken, Walker & Rhoads in Philadelphia, and by
Daniel J. Johnson, legal counsel to American Medical Systems Inc.

9TH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS INJUNCTION ON MANUFACTURER OF DEFIBRILLATORS

         A Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals panel on Dec. 28
affirmed a district court's issuance of an injunction against a
manufacturer of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) for
alleged violations of the Medical Device Recording (MDR)
regulations.  United States v. Laerdal Manufacturing Corp. et
al., No. 94-35780 (9th Cir.).

         The panel upheld the district court's findings that
defendant Laerdal Manufacturing Corp. failed to timely file a
report with the Food and Drug Administration after one of its
AEDs allegedly failed.

         The litigation involves a Laerdal AED that was applied in
June 1993 to a man in cardiac arrest in Grand Rapids, MI.  The
device allegedly did not apply any shock to the man's heart, and
the man died after the AED was disconnected and an ambulance crew
applied its own defibrillator.  Laerdal did eventually file a
report on the incident, but argued that the circumstances of the
incident did not make filing a report necessary.

         After the U.S. government filed suit against Laerdal, the
U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon determined that
the company had violated 21 C.F.R. Section 803(a)(1)(i), which
requires a manufacturer to file a report with the FDA whenever
information is received that suggests that a patient care device
may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury.

         Laerdal argued that the district court improperly imposed
the injunction because there was no cognizable danger that the
company would violate the MDR regulation in the future.  Laerdal
asserted that the Grand Rapids incident was an isolated incident
and that the company has taken the necessary steps to prevent
future violations.

         The Ninth Circuit rejected Laerdal's contention of the
isolation of the Grand Rapids incident.

         "The [district] court developed at length the facts
surrounding the incident in Grand Rapids that first brought
Laerdal's reporting practices to the FDA's attention, but the
court also found testimony in the record that Laerdal had
received complaints of other instances in which a Laerdal AED
failed to work properly," the panel said.

         The district court also found that Laerdal had an ongoing
history of not implementing proper FDA reporting procedures, the
panel said.

         "Even if the district court had found evidence of only one
violation, Laerdal is in error in asserting that one violation
provides insufficient grounds for granting an injunction," the
panel concluded.
                   The panel cited its decision in Burlington Northern Railroad
Co. v. Department of Revenue of the State of Washington, 934 F.2d
1064, 1074-5 (9th Cir. 1991).  In Burlington, the court
determined that a statutory injunction may be imposed when a
violation of a statute has been or is about to be committed.

         "Laerdal's repeated self-justification is sufficient to show
a likelihood of future violation," the panel stated.  "Even if
Laerdal had not intended to violate the regulation, its continued
insistence on justifying its actions in committing the violation
'is an important factor in deciding whether future violations are
sufficiently likely to warrant an injunction.'"

         The panel also rejected Laerdal's argument that the public
interest was not harmed because the FDA allegedly suffers from a
backlog in filing its reports and the Grand Rapids report would
have languished for several months before being filed.

         "The public interest addressed by the MDR regulations
centers not on the efficiency of the FDA, but on the attention
manufacturers pay to evidence that their products could be
causing or contributing to needless deaths," the panel stated.

         Representing the plaintiff was Craig J. Casey, Assistant
U.S. Attorney in Portland, OR, and Elizabeth Stein of the U.S.
Department of Justice in Washington, DC.  Counsel for Laerdal was
James F. Dulcich, Jeffrey D. Austin and James N. Westwood of
Miller, Nash, Wiener, Hager & Carlsen in Portland, OR; and by
Daniel G. Jarcho and Daniel E. Johnson of McKenna, Conner & Cuneo
in Washington, DC.

AHCPR Releases
Cataract Guidelines

Although it stops short of charging surgical overuse, a federally sponsored
clinical guideline for cataract management urges the use of glasses and
other visual aids before rushing a patient into surgery. In 1991, 1.35
million procedures were performed.

The presence of a cataract, a naturally occurring cloudiness of the eye,
"never solely justifies" surgery, says Dennis O'Day, MD, chairman of the
18-member panel commissioned by the Agency for Health Care Policy &
Research (AHCPR) to develop the guidelines. In most cases, surgery should
be performed only if patients feel their lifestyle is compromised or if
visual impairment isn't corrected by glasses or other interventions, says
the guideline. Claiming that tests currently used by ophthalmologists to
gauge if surgery is necessary don't work, O'Day argues, "ultimately, the
decision is made by the patient."

Ophthalmologists who perform cataract surgeries have an "ethical
obligation" to provide postoperative care, says the guideline. Although
some postop care can be delegated to other professionals, including nurses
and optometrists, the guideline recommends that the primary responsibility
for postop rehabilitation fall to the primary ophthalmologist.

The guideline enjoys wide support from ophthalmology groups, but the
American Optometric Assn. charges the document "largely ignores the
extensive and legitimate role of optometrists." AOA disputes that
ophthalmologists should be the only provider of postoperative care for
patients who have "clearly recovered" from surgery.

Carotid Endarterectomy Still Questionable

The latest study on surgery to prevent stroke deaths does little to clear
up controversy over the treatment. Whether carotid endarterectomy reduces
mortality remains uncertain despite the procedure's widespread use, say
researchers, blaming sample size for their lack of conclusions.

The prospective Veterans' Affairs study, reported in the Jan. 28 New
England Journal of Medicine, followed 444 men with asymptomatic carotid
stenosis at 11 VA medical centers nationwide between 1983 and 1991.
Carotid stenosis is a hardening of one of the two main arteries in the
neck. Endarterectomy is the surgical removal of atherosclerotic plaque from
the artery. In 1990, 68,000 endarterectomies were performed in the U.S.,
down from a peak of 107,000 in 1985.

The researchers set out to find endarterectomy's effect on stroke and on
transient monocular blindness and transient ischemic attacks, both warning
symptoms of carotid stenosis. The patients were randomly assigned to groups
treated either surgically or medically. Both groups were treated with
aspirin. In the surgical group, 4.7 percent suffered strokes, compared with
9.4 percent in the medical group, but the combined incidence of stroke and
death "showed no benefit from operative intervention."

Outcomes Leader
Is Key Clinton Adviser

Thomas Pyle, acting chairman of the new Health Outcomes Institute, has a
key role advising the Clinton Administration on health care system
infrastructure and support, including quality assurance.

Formerly CEO of the Harvard Community Health Plan, Pyle is listed as chair
of a White House working group on health reform in an undated internal
document obtained last week by F&G's Automated Medical Payments News.
According to the memo, the working group addressing "New System
Infrastructure and Support" is divided into two subgroups: one addressing
Quality Assurance and the other, Administration, Reimbursement and
Information Systems. Pyle is listed as chairing both.

Meanwhile, the formal announcement that Pyle is acting chair of the Health
Outcomes Institute -- the successor to InterStudy -- was made Feb. 8. The
Institute's board includes Pyle, William Goss of General Electric, Kermit
Knudsen, MD, of Scott & White Clinic, and Donald Steinwachs of Johns
Hopkins University (MOGA 1/11/93).

The Minnesota-based Institute promotes the "Outcomes Management System"
(OMS), originally developed under the leadership of Paul Ellwood, MD, when
he was at InterStudy. OMS relies on the generic SF-36 patient quality-of-
life instrument and condition-specific TyPE questionnaires, filled out by
treating physicians. Information is gathered before, during, and after
clinical interventions and surgeries. Proponents want this approach
incorporated into the "managed competition" reform proposal now being
developed by the Clinton Administration. They propose that the Institute
become the central repository for OMS information and disseminate it to
payers and consumers, as a quality check on large health plan providers
(MOGA 1/28, 2/11).

Other names included in the memo as members of a Quality Assurance sub-
group include former HCFA researcher Henry Krakauer, MD, HCFA Health
Standards & Quality Bureau Director Barbara Gagel, Institute of Medicine
researcher Kathleen Lohr, and AHCPR senior staffer Linda Demlo. One insider
said the group hasn't yet grappled with specific approaches like OMS. At
press time, Pyle was unavailable for comment.

Medicare Quality Studies
Shouldn't Get Too Elaborate -- HCFA

The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is telling Medicare PROs
not to get carried away with elaborate and costly quality-of-care studies.
That's the message of a Feb. 3 draft memo to PROs from HCFA Senior
Physician Adviser Stephen Jencks, M D, regarding implementation of HCFA's
"Health Care Quality Improvement Initiative," which is to be phased in to
PRO workplans beginning Apr. 1.

In collaborating on practice pattern analysis with local physicians and
hospitals, PROs should "avoid research and writing guidelines," says
Jencks. He calls that the responsibility of AHCPR, arguing that PROs should
choose manageable, time-limited projects that emphasize "direct human
contact" between PROs and local providers.

Jencks recommends that PROs look at, among other things, differential
diagnosis in stroke, underuse of breast and cervical cancer screening, and
DRG coding errors. PROs should focus on areas showing "substantial
variation" between local practice and existing guidelines promulgated by
medical specialty societies, says the memo.

Jencks' recommendation that PROs use existing specialty society guidelines
to study variation is likely to raise eyebrows in the research community.
Duke University Professor David Eddy, MD, RAND researcher Robert Brook, MD,
the U.S. General Accounting Office, and others all argue that these
guidelines often haven't been validated by outcomes research and vary
substantially in terms of the rigor with which they're developed. Brook has
been especially critical of guidelines developed in the absence of
substantial literature reviews.

Lee To Head Public Health Service

HHS Secretary Donna Shalala has selected Philip Lee, MD, as Asst. Secretary
for Health. The job involves managing the $21 billion Public Health
Service, which oversees the Agency for Health Care Policy & Research
(AHCPR).

Lee, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University
of California at San Francisco, currently heads the Physician Payment
Review Commission. The PPRC's 1992 Annual Report to Congress included a
section critical of AHCPR. The re port accused the agency of failing to
develop guidelines addressing the most costly and overused treatments and
procedures.

"The efforts of guideline developers are not guided by a consistent set of
priorities," said PPRC. The report called for closer scrutiny of how panels
deliberate, more disclosure of the underpinnings of panel findings, more
efficient literature searches, and attention to questionable procedures
like chest x-rays, colonoscopy, and appendectomy.

AHCPR Administrator J. Jarrett Clinton, MD, tells MOGA that despite budget
constraints, AHCPR is reordering its priorities to focus more on cost
issues than it did initially. He cites guidelines now in process addressing
smoking cessation and mammography. Clinton says he has made no secret of
his wish to stay in his current position, that he has heard nothing from
the new Administration, and that his relations with Lee are "excellent."

MN Blues Form Managed Care Network
For Elective Cardiac Procedures

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota (BCBSM) and its Blue Plus HMO have
formed a network of what they consider the state's 10 best cardiac care
providers in an effort to manage elective cardiac care procedures. The
Minnesota Blues say of their Project Health Vision Cardiac Network that for
"the first time in Minnesota, patient outcomes and other quality of care
measures have been used to select providers."

BCBSM used the MedisGroups data analysis and severity indexing system to
compare complication and mortality rates for a variety of cardiac
procedures among hospitals throughout the state. The providers chosen by
the combination insurer/HMO-style provider for its network average 15
deaths per 1,000 for cardiac procedures, compared with a statewide average
of 35 deaths per 1,000. BCBSM formed the network to provide cardiac
catheterization, electrophysiologic diagnostics, angioplasty, coronary
artery bypass grafts (CABG), and valve surgery -- all on an elective,
nonemergency basis.

"Our research showed wide variation in patient outcomes among cardiac care
providers" in the state, says Mark Banks, MD, senior VP of BCBSM and COO of
Blue Plus. In addition to the MedisGroups data, BCBSM chose the providers
according to their experience with the procedures and their "potential to
participate in a long term relationship with Blue Plus."

Blue Plus and BCBSM plan to use similar selection techniques over the next
few years to create networks for oncology, orthopedics, high-risk
maternity, neurology, and physical therapy.

All three of Minneapolis-St.Paul's major hospital systems are included in
the network, says Vic Ellison, VP of the Metropolitan Healthcare Council,
the Twin Cities' hospital association. A spokeperson from the statewide
Minnesota Hospital Assn. said "all of the major players" in the state are
involved in the network.

AHCPR Insures Guideline Developers,
Offers Legal Guidance to Panels

The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) has purchased
liability insurance to protect members of agency-sponsored guidelines
panels, should the guidelines they produce not hold up in court. To date,
AHCPR has spent approximately $150,000 for a policy that would cover
individuals or entire teams, including consultants, for up to $5 million,
says an agency spokesperson.

An AHCPR report on "The Use of Language in Clinical Practice Guidelines" is
expected to be released to the public in the next few months. A draft has
already been distributed to the federal guidelines panels and is now
winding its way through an elaborate clearance and revision process.

The report, like the four guideline sets the agency has released so far,
will include a "quick reference guide" and a longer monograph. These offer
"guidelines on developing guidelines" for teams concerned with the "legal
implications" of the language they are using. Written by George Washington
University's Center for Health Policy Research, it has sections devoted to
the legal significance of words, hazards inherent to guidelines drafting,
the importance of documenting all decisions that led to finalizing
guidelines, and actual legal cases that examined practice guidelines. The
report should become available "no later than June," says Kathleen
Hastings, director of the agency's Legal Medicine Program.

The Agency commissioned the report to calm fears expressed by AHCPR's own
guidelines panels, but the report should be useful for specialty societies
and others developing practice guidelines, says Hastings.
For more on legal issues in guideline development, see p. 7.

Maine Liability Project
May Include More Specialties

If legislation proposed in Maine late last month is signed into law, it
will expand the state's ground-breaking Medical Liability Demonstration
Project to allow inclusion of all medical specialties. Only four are
currently participating: anesthesiology, emergency medicine,
obstetrics/gynecology, and radiology.

At press time, the proposal was being reviewed by the state's banking and
insurance committee and awaiting a public hearing.

Under the current law, the first of its type in the country, physicians may
use proof of adherence to state panel-produced practice guidelines as an
"affirmative defense" in malpractice cases. The 1990 law called for a five-
year demonstration period beginning in January 1992, during which
defendants who signed on as participants can introduce evidence that they
followed one or more of the 20 protocols for the four specialties. The law
stipulated that the project would not begin unless more than half of the
state's practitioners in each of those specialties agreed to participate.
Among the specialties, enlistment has ranged "from 58 percent to almost 90
percent in ob/gyn," says Gordon Smith, counsel for the Maine Medical Assn.
Under the new proposal, any additional specialties that wished to
participate would also have to sign up over half of their members.

The law intends to lower medical costs in the state by stemming the tide of
defensive medicine. Similar laws have since been enacted in Minnesota,
Vermont, and Florida (see box on p. 8).

There have been no test cases so far under the five-year project, and the
likelihood that any will come soon is slim, says Smith. "These 20 protocols
deal with a very small portion of the medicine practiced in a small state
by a small number of physicians. We're glad to see (the other three states)
joining in because it's going to take a lot more data than we have to
examine the liability issue."

While liability seems to be the main focus of the Maine project, it's
important not to lose sight of the program's effect on patients, says
Robert Keller, MD, executive director of the Maine Medical Assessment
Foundation. He calls for a study documenting changes in patient outcomes
resulting from practitioners following the parameters.

CA Firms Start High-Tech Angioplasty Tests

Two California medical device manufacturers are launching separate clinical
trials focusing on percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
outcomes. One study is designed to determine if patients with lesions
determined "significant" by angiography might benefit from drug therapy
over PTCA. The other study is designed to evaluate PTCA success when the
invasive nonsurgical procedure is performed by a combination
ultrasound/angioplasty device.

Mountain View-based Cardiometrics will test its ultrasound catheter, called
FloWire, in 14 hospitals across the country "to conclude that patients
whose coronary lesions don't impair blood flow are appropriately excluded
from angioplasty."

The prospective, controlled trial will randomize 425 patients with
"angiographically significant" lesions that do not impair blood flow to
groups receiving either angioplasty or drug therapy. "Our belief is that
angioplasty done on lesions that don't impair blood flow will not lead to
greater angina relief than medical therapy alone," says Nat Bowditch,
Cardiometrics marketing manager. The two groups will be assessed at 30
days, six months, and one year to determine whether symptoms are relieved
and patients' ability to perform a standardized exercise stress test.
Adverse event rates including coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG),
myocardial infarctions, and mortality will be compared. It is estimated
that 375,000 PTCAs were performed in the U.S last year at a cost of about
$10,000-$15,000 each.

Pleasanton-based EndoSonics is starting a randomized, multicenter clinical
trial of a projected 500 patients to test its combination ultrasound
catheter and balloon angioplasty device, called Oracle-Micro. EndoSonics
will test the effectiveness of PTCAs performed with the Oracle-Micro
against those performed with traditional PTCA devices, which do not offer
simultaneous ultrasound imaging. A six-month follow-up will compare
complication rates for the two groups. Complications from PTCA include
thrombosis, artery dissection, and acute reclosure, says EndoSonics
President Mike Henson.

Specialty Society Ready To Release
Parkinson's Disease Guidelines

The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is set to release its guidelines
for initial treatment of Parkinson's disease. A draft of the guidelines,
which were approved by the AAN's executive board this week, calls for using
levodopa as a front-line therapy because it is "usually the most effective"
of all the drugs indicated for alleviating symptoms. The draft lists the
advantages and drawbacks of the other drugs in relation to levodopa.

The AAN says it developed the guidelines because of current variations and
controversy surrounding initial treatment. The group describes initial
therapy as the first two years of treatment following diagnosis. The
recommendations are based on a literature search of 818 articles and
textbooks and were approved by consensus of AAN experts.

The guidelines caution that treatment must be tailored to each patient and
that prolonged follow-up is necessary to recognize and adjust for
medication side effects. Doctors are told to encourage physical activity
and watch for signs of depression. In addition to treatment
recommendations, the guidelines contain recommendations for future
research, including outcomes studies to assess the benefits of physical
therapy.

MN Managed Care Firm Tests
Substance Abuse Outcomes Measures

A managed mental health care firm is launching a nationwide pilot study to
test a system for measuring substance abuse treatment outcomes. Ultimately
the system will be used to create what developers call "empirically based
standards of care" for providers.

Minneapolis-based MCC Behavioral Care, a subsidiary of Cigna, commissioned
a team of researchers at the University of Minnesota to construct a
database for ongoing analysis of care and its effects on patient recovery,
cravings, and relapses. MCC will use the database to measure clinical,
medical, behavioral, emotional, and economic outcomes. Factors measured
include abuse levels, quality of life, social functioning, employment
status, medical status, and duration of abstinence.

The project aims to separate the effects of treatment from other influences
on outcomes, gauge success rates for various treatment approaches, examine
variations among therapists, and determine cost-effectiveness of treatment.
Patients' pretreatment baseline data will be compared with posttreatment
data.

The firm also plans to use the data to tell employers if they are spending
enough, or too much, on substance abuse treatment. The Institute for a
Drug-Free Workplace estimates U.S. employers lose $60 billion a year
through drug abuse-related accidents, medical claims, absenteeism, theft,
and lost productivity.

MCC plans to analyze the pilot data in October, when it will begin to
expand the program to all its sites. The MCC network includes 1,500
inpatient and outpatient facilities. MCC covers 5 million individuals. It
estimates 150,000 to 250,000 of those individuals will have substance abuse
problems each year.

The project aims to set scientific standards in an area of care
traditionally viewed as rife with ambiguity. "Until now care has been based
on clinical judgment. In the '90s, we are finally beginning to practice
empirical health care," says Robert Kane, MD, head of the research team at
the University of Minnesota's Center for Health Services Research and
Policy. Once the pilot study for the substance abuse system is over and the
program is in place throughout the network, MCC says it will begin work on
similar systems for depression and anxiety.

Vasectomy May Increase
Risk of Prostate Cancer

Two studies of a total of 73,000 men point to a link between vasectomy and
an elevated risk of developing prostate cancer. Researchers say the cancer
risk increases over time following the procedure, but they are unable to
pinpoint the correlation's cause. In light of the studies' findings, the
American Urological Assn. (AUA) is recommending that younger vasectomized
men follow guidelines established by the AUA and the American Cancer
Society for early detection of prostate cancer in men ages 50 -70.

The NIH-sponsored studies, one prospective and one retrospective, found
that men who had a vasectomy more than 20 years ago have up to an 89
percent "elevated risk" of developing prostate cancer. Both studies,
conducted by Edward Giovannucci, MD, of Harvard University and Brigham and
Women's Hospital, and colleagues appeared in the Feb. 17 Journal of the
American Medical Association.

The prospective study began in 1986 and compared 10,055 40- to 75-year-old
health professionals who had had a vasectomy with 37,800 similar men who
had not. Three hundred cases of prostate cancer appeared in the
vasectomized group between 1986 and 19 90. This group had no previous
cancer history. Baseline data were taken at the study's outset, and follow-
up questionnaires were collected in 1988 and 1990. The overall increased
risk of prostate cancer in the vasectomy group is 66 percent -- a figure
that rises to 85 percent 22 years post-vasectomy.

The retrospective study used a questionnaire that had been administered in
1976. Researchers followed up in 1989 with reports on 13,034 men with
vasectomies and 12,306 without. The researchers found an overall 56 percent
increase in prostate cancer for the vasectomy group. It was in this group
that the risk rose to 89 percent 20 years post-vasectomy.

"The mechanisms that might link vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer
remain undefined," the researchers say. The studies were designed to rule
out "detection bias" and causal effects from smoking, alcohol consumption,
level of physical activity, diet, educational level, body mass index, and
geographical area of residence. Because the risk factors for prostate
cancer remain unknown, the researchers say it is "impossible" to "ensure
that the true risk factors" were equally distributed among the cohorts.

While the researchers argue that the increased risk over time rules out
better detection in vasectomized men, "bias was not properly addressed,"
says Marc Goldstein, MD, director of male reproduction and microsurgery at
the New York Hospital/Cornell University's department of urology. Goldstein
says that because all the vasectomized men had seen a urologist pre- and
post-surgery, "Diagnosis of prostate cancer goes up. This clearly explains
the difference."

The AUA immediately released an official statement upon the studies'
publication that warns the suggested relationship "does not mean that men
who have had a vasectomy should seek a reversal of the procedure" because
"the data are far too preliminary ." Four previous studies found a link
between vasectomy and prostate cancer, while three others did not.

The AUA does caution, however, "If vasectomy is a risk factor for prostate
cancer, people need to know and informed choices need to be made." Prostate
cancer is now the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men.
One in 11 men in the United States will develop prostate cancer, the
majority of whom will not have had a vasectomy. More than 15 percent of
American men over 40 have had a vasectomy.

The AUA/ACS guidelines for men between the ages of 50 and 70 advise annual
rectal examinations and testing for serum prostatic antigen levels. The AUA
is now saying that men who had a vasectomy more than 20 years ago, or when
they were over 40 years old, should get exams and tests regardless of their
age.

Guidelines in the Courtroom:
Great Expectations

I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I've
recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines
and if they follow these guidelines, it raises the presumption that they
didn't do anything wrong. -- Bill Clinton, presidential debate, Oct. 15,
1992.

As policymakers prepare to attack health care costs with various proposals,
many are lining up malpractice spending in their sights. The weapon most of
them are aiming: practice guidelines.

Recent estimates place potential savings from malpractice reform at a
projected $36 billion over the next five years. It is still unclear,
however, whether better guidelines would indeed lower the cash awards and
number of malpractice cases through fostering better care, or whether they
would serve to increase malpractice awards and cases by giving plaintiffs'
attorneys more ammunition in court.

"I am currently working on an Administration task force looking at
malpractice reform, and we are definitely examining practice guidelines as
alternatives," Kathleen Hastings, director of the Agency for Health Care
Policy & Research's (AHCPR) Legal Medicine Program, told a gathering of
policymakers and analysts earlier this month in Washington DC.

The group, convened by the Assn. of Academic Health Centers (AHC) to
investigate the rapidly growing bond between guidelines and the law,
explored topics including whether federally produced guidelines would soon
take legal precedence over those produced by states and private
organizations. The AHC is a not-for-profit health care education
organization with over 100 institutional members in the United States and
Canada.

Maine is the first state to battle malpractice costs with a legal defense
for physicians who follow state-sponsored guidelines. The federal
government taking that same route "is possible but not likely," says Gordon
Smith, legal counsel to the Maine Medical Assn. and chief expert on the
Maine law, pointing to the U.S.' tradition of handling tort laws on a
state-by-state basis.

The move in most states' courtrooms, however, has been toward acceptance of
standards produced on a national level, whether by government agency or
specialty society, says Troyen Brennan, MD. A national approach must
account for regional differences in standards of care, such as those in
rural areas versus inner cities; conflicting standards, such as
disagreements over mammography screening; and uneven resource distribution,
cautions Brennan, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. AHCPR's Hastings counters that
nationally produced guidelines "can be tailored to a local level later."

The American Medical Assn. wants to see guidelines legislation for
malpractice defense remain at the state level, at least for now. The
science of guidelines creation is "still in its infancy, not reliable
enough to mandate nationally," says Ed Hirshfeld, the AMA's associate
general counsel for health law.

Hirshfeld told the group that the AMA's policy asserts that guidelines,
which it calls parameters, should retain their current status alongside
peer-reviewed studies and expert witnesses as "simply one source of
evidence" among many that judges and juries should consider in malpractice
cases. The AMA is concerned that mandating practice patterns nationwide
might stifle creativity in clinical research, technology, and drug
development, and other "experimentation in the margins," creating a
chilling effect. Mandating standards of care on a national level would also
damage efforts to fine-tune those standards, Hirshfeld says.

One advantage of the Maine law, which has yet to be tested in court, is
that it will stop "the battle of the experts" on the witness stand, says
Smith. Maine's "affirmative defense" stands in contrast to President
Clinton's recommendation of raising "presumption" against physician
wrongdoing, because presumption will leave the defense wide open for
rebuttal from plaintiff's attorneys and their hired guns, Smith predicts.

Conflicting testimony on scientific evidence that points in several
directions already has courts in a quandary, says Franklin Zweig, senior
staff scientist at George Washington University's Center for Health Policy
Research. Merely blocking attempts to weave guidelines into federal law
"won't stop the issue from being litigated in courts," warns Zweig, who
recommends health care professionals take advantage of this early stage in
guidelines litigation by moving forward to educate trial judges so they
can recognize valid, scientifically sound practices.

Judges are ripe for educational efforts, says Zweig. In a recent random-
sample survey conducted by his Center, trial judges rated medical practice
guidelines as third among topics for which they want more information.
Alcoholism science and genetic-based criminal evidence came in first and
second. Zweig attributes this desire to know more to the growing number and
complexity of health-related cases currently winding their way through the
courts. Many of those cases will soon have practice guidelines as their
main core of evidence, regardless of who created them or whether they are
mandated. -- D.S.

Three States Join Maine
With Malpractice Defense Laws

Maine was the first state to pass legislation tying practice guidelines to
malpractice defense. To date, three other states have approached the
'guidelines as defense' arena as part of state health care reform
legislation:

Vermont's Universal Access statute, passed in 1992 and awaiting adoption in
Jan. 1994, will allow practice guidelines "recognized by state law" as
admissible evidence in cases judging whether a provider "met or failed to
meet the applicable standard of care." The state calls upon provider
organizations, hospitals, and quality assurance programs to draft the state
guidelines. The statute also establishes a nonbinding arbitration system
for all medical liability claims.

Under its Health Care Reform Act of 1992, Florida mandates the "adoption
and implementation" of "scientifically sound medical practice parameters"
to eliminate "unwarranted" variations in health care delivery. Physicians
participating in a demonstration project between June of this year and Oct.
1, 1998, will be able to use compliance with the parameters as an
"affirmative defense" similar to the one established in Maine. The statute
also calls for periodic reviews and revisions of the parameters to ensure
they are based on the latest scientific findings. The state plans to
address overall tort reform in upcoming legislative sessions.

As part of its reform legislation, Minnesota's 1992 HealthRight Act
established a program to develop, adopt, revise, and disseminate practice
parameters, drawing from those developed within the state and those created
by AHCPR and national specialty societies. Under the Act, adherence to the
state-sanctioned guidelines is an "absolute defense" giving the defendant
an automatic win -- a sharp contrast to Maine's "affirmative defense." The
absolute defense is suspended in cases involving delay in diagnosis,
misdiagnosis, inappropriate application of the parameter, or failure to
obtain informed consent.

HEAT ON US ANALGESICS AS BAYER LAUNCHES ACTRON

Bayer has launched Actron, its OTC version of the non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory, ketoprofen, onto an already crowded US market for
headache.

Actron is entering the non-prescription market two months after
Whitehall-Robins' rival ketoprofen brand, Orudis KT, and 18 months
after Procter-Syntex' NSAI switch, Aleve (naproxen sodium), shook up
the intensely competitive analgesic segment.

So far the principle that being first to market is crucial to the long-
term success of switches appears to be confirmed by Johnson &
Johnson/Merck's H2-antagonist, Pepcid AC (famotidine) - a product that
was something of an also-ran in prescription drug terms.

Pepcid has managed to maintain around a seven per cent market share
differential over SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet HB (cimetidine) by
arriving first, Merck & Co senior vice-president Judy Lewent told
securities analysts in mid-December.

"Thanks to Merck research, Pepcid was first on the market because,
quite frankly, Tagamet had better name recognition. If Pepcid had come
in second, that would have been a challenge", she said.

Small but powerful

Bayer announced on 8 January that Actron was available in drug, food
and mass merchandise retail outlets throughout the US. Both versions of
ketoprofen were approved for OTC switching by the Food and Drug
Administration on 6 October 1995 (OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 32,
page 3).

Actron is being promoted in full-page newspaper advertisements in top
20 markets and USA Today, as well as in television adverts featuring
the theme, "Actron. It's so small because it's so powerful."

Bayer sees size as a key selling point - Actron is 7ml in diameter, at
least one-third smaller than (Whitehall's) Advil, (Johnson & Johnson's)
Extra Strength Tylenol and Orudis KT tablets.

The company is supplying a full array of promotional materials,
including "Try Me Free" displays in many retail outlets. This will
enable consumers to purchase one 24-tablet bottle with full-price
rebate during the introductory period.

Gary Balkema, president of Bayer Consumer Care in the US, said the
launch was the single biggest in the division's history.

"We're excited to be launching Actron because it represents a
meaningful new choice in OTC pain relief", he commented. "Actron's
powerful medicine offers effectiveness against many types of pain. And
its unique size gives a new, tangible benefit for consumers: it's easy
to swallow."

Bayer appears to be counting on its Aspirin legacy to give the new
brand vital leverage in the analgesics market.

"With Bayer Aspirin, this company brought the first branded analgesic
to the consumer marketplace almost 100 years ago. Now with Actron,
we're poised to significantly impact the analgesics category again as
we approach the 21st century", Mr Balkema said.

A recent survey conducted by Bayer found there was "more than enough
room in the very competitive OTC analgesics market for a differentiated
new entry like Actron", he added.

Unmet need

This study confirmed that 89 per cent of American adults suffer from
aches and pains each year but more than a third of these do not at
present take medication to help relieve the pain. The average adult
spends one of every five days - or a total of more than two months each
year - in pain, the survey found.

"Because analgesics can work differently in many individuals, we think
offering Actron as a new choice with ketoprofen in a unique new size
will go a long way towards serving unmet consumer need", Mr Balkema
asserted.

Merck & Co's comments on Pepcid AC were made to securities analysts on
12 December 1995. Ms Lewent said the brand was the leading US acid
relief product with a market share of 22 per cent at the end of
November, successfully thwarting the challenge from Tagamet HB.

SmithKline Beecham maintains, however, that its product is performing
extremely well in the US market. Analysts' estimates put Tagamet HB
sales at around $3 million per week, only slightly behind Pepcid AC.

Ms Lewent presented Nielsen data indicating that Pepcid AC climbed to
the number one spot in the $1 billion antacid market within one month
of its OTC launch in June 1994. When Tagamet HB was subsequently
introduced in mid-August, it leapt to number one, the Nielsen data
showed.

Pepcid AC regained the lead in late September and was holding onto it
as of 25 November, the Merck official said.

According to the Nielsen data, Tagamet HB then dipped to third place -
just behind SB's older antacid, Tums - with about a 13 per cent market
share. J&J/Merck's Mylanta held just over 10 per cent of the segment.

Most successful OTC?

Ms Lewent described Pepcid AC as "the most successful launch in US OTC
history. The big initial push ... for Tagamet HB was the direct result
of very heavy couponing", she noted.

"The significant market expansion that we are seeing validates the
theory that bringing an established prescription product with a
significant franchise into the OTC market can transform the marketplace
and revitalise growth", the Merck official told analysts.

Pepcid slightly widened its lead in the week ended 2 December 1995,
according to the company's figures. The brand's most recently quoted
market share was 24 per cent compared with 12 per cent for Tagamet HB.

Despite the strong initial sales, Merck & Co does not expect to see
substantial profits from Pepcid AC until the end of the decade because
of heavy promotional spending, Ms Lewent said.

SB BUYS INTO GERMAN MASS MARKET

SmithKline Beecham prepared for Christmas by fattening up its German
OTC business with a DM203 million ($142 million) agreement to purchase
Abtei Pharma-Vertriebs GmbH, a distributor of vitamin and mineral
supplements (VMS) and natural remedies.

The acquisition sees SB widen its consumer healthcare interests in
Germany - previously centred on oral care and the pharmacy sector - to
take in grocery outlets, where Abtei is the leading OTC presence,
SmithKline says.

Assuming approval by the Federal Cartel Office, the transaction will
also make SB the leading consumer healthcare company in Germany, it
adds.

Based in Bielefeld, Westphalia, Abtei is a family-owned concern founded
in 1972 (although the Abtei brand dates back to the last century). It
has a workforce of 125. Last year Abtei registered sales of DM130
million compared with DM110 million in 1994.

The company's product range includes vitamin and mineral supplements,
natural medicines, dietary products and skincare. Around half of its
portfolio is licensed medicines and the rest food and vitamin
supplements.

Abtei holds a 20 per cent share of a German OTC grocery market valued
at DM550 million (manufacturers' selling prices).

Oral care profile

To date, SmithKline has been associated mainly with oral care in
Germany, and it is the market leader in this category, the company
noted. Its existing German subsidiaries are Lingner & Fischer, which
sells oral hygiene products, and Fink, ranked sixth in the pharmacy OTC
market.

This latest acquisition will boost SB's share of the German healthcare
market by 25 per cent.

Abtei will both complement and consolidate SmithKline's pharmacy VMS
business, which includes leading brands such as Eunova multivitamins,
Cetebe (vitamin C) and Granufink for urological indications, offering
potential to divert SB pharmacy brands through Abtei's grocery channels
and visa versa.

The move into the mass market does not signal a particular European
strategy but is rather country-specific, and reflects Germany's
propensity for preventative healthcare, SB told OTC Business News.

However, Peter Jensen, chairman of SmithKline Beecham Consumer
Healthcare Europe, said the OTC division would undertake "a full
analysis of the market opportunity for the (Abtei) products across
Europe and elsewhere".

"With the increasing consumer awareness of positive "well-being"
healthcare and with ageing populations in the developed world, we
consider that natural medicines and health supplements have tremendous
potential for expansion, and our track record has demonstrated SB's
ability to reach the target consumers', he commented.

SB estimates the European OTC grocery market at #1.5 billion "and
growing".

No short-term changes

SmithKline will retain the Abtei brand and says it does not plan any
short-term changes in the German company's operations. It has given
undertakings to consult Abtei's management on any future restructuring.

Manufacturing for Abtei is contracted out, and these arrangements will
remain in place after the acquisition.

The German company had been looking for a partner to help it expand
further on the domestic and international health shop and pharmacy
markets, said managing director Andreas Sarhage.

SB had the resources to support Abtei on the medical and scientific
front, and to bolster its international product development, he added.

The deal suggests that relatively modest, targeted acquisitions are the
way into the German OTC market, which is regarded as somewhat
impenetrable.

Boots Healthcare International has made no secret of its ambition to
buy up a German OTC presence but to date has cited price levels as a
persistent deterrent.

FEMSTAT SECOND SWITCH FOR PROCTER-SYNTEX

Procter-Syntex is preparing a spring launch for its second prescription-
to-OTC switch, Femstat 3 vaginal cream (butoconazole nitrate 2 per
cent).

Cleared for OTC use by the Food and Drug Administration on 27 December
1995, Femstat will be the first and only three-day treatment for
vaginal yeast infections available without a prescription in the US,
said Procter & Gamble, which will market the product to physicians and
other health professionals as well as direct to consumers.

All of the current OTC options for vaginal yeast infection require
seven days of treatment, P&G noted, adding that clinical trials had
shown Femstat 3 to be as safe and effective as Johnson & Johnson's
Monistat 7, the leading brand in an estimated $250 million US market
for OTC vaginal antifungals (IIR retail figures, November 1995).

Butoconazole nitrate was first launched on prescription in 1986 and has
been marketed as a three-day regimen by Syntex (now part of Roche) as
Femstat and Femstat Prefill. The US patent on butoconazole for fungal
infections expires in March 1997; Procter-Syntex will now gain three
years of marketing exclusivity for Femstat 3.

Prescription Femstat will be withdrawn from the US market once its OTC
derivative is launched, P&G said.

The non-prescription version was developed by The Procter-Syntex Health
Products Company, the US joint venture that brought its first switch,
Aleve (naproxen sodium), to market in June 1994. Femstat will be
manufactured for OTC sale by Roche.

An NDA for the prescription-to-OTC switch was filed with the FDA on 20
December 1993. Because the safety and efficacy data were comparable
with seven-day OTC yeast treatments, Femstat 3 did not have to undergo
advisory committee review, P&G told OTC Business News.

Creams preferred

Femstat 3 will be available in US pharmacies, drugstores, supermarkets
and mass merchandise outlets in a 5g prefilled disposable applicator,
with three applicators packaged together as a per-day treatment
regimen. The cream will also be sold in a 20g tube packaged with three
disposable cardboard applicators.

According to P&G, its research indicates that more than 50 per cent of
women would rather buy vaginal creams than suppositories. "This plays
out in the marketplace, where nearly 70 per cent of OTC vaginal yeast
infection products sold are in the form of creams", the company
commented.

It stressed that Femstat 3 is for treating the recurrent symptoms of
previously diagnosed vaginal yeast infection: first-time sufferers
should consult a doctor.

A physician should also be contacted if there is abdominal pain, fever
or a foul-smelling discharge; if the infection does not clear up in
three days or symptoms return within two months; or if the sufferer
thinks she has been exposed to the HIV virus.

Women who are (or believe they may be) pregnant should not use Femstat
3, the labelling points out. The product is also contraindicated in
women who are HIV-positive, diabetics and girls under 12 years old.

Clinical evidence

More than 13 million women worldwide have been treated with
butoconazole nitrate for vaginal yeast infections. In 45 clinical
studies involving a total of 5,289 patients, the drug-related incidence
of local adverse reactions (eg, burning and itching) with butoconazole
was equivalent to that of Monistat 7, P&G said.

Two controlled clinical trials conducted in support of the switch
application showed that a three-day regimen of butoconazole nitrate 2
per cent (more than 300 patients were evaluated) was as safe and
effective as seven days of miconazole nitrate 2 per cent cream
(Monistat 7, also tested on more than 300 patients) in combating
vulvovaginal candidiasis when assessed at eight and 30 days post-
treatment, the company added.

According to P&G, the incidence of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the US
nearly doubled between 1980 and 1990, to 13 million cases per year.

Handsome payoff

Vaginal antifungal switches have paid off handsomely in the US. The
first such product to reach the market, Schering-Plough's Gyne-
Lotrimin, grew from a $27 million brand prescription to generate $115
million in OTC sales.

However, Gyme-lotrimin is now relegated firmly to second place in the
OTC vaginal antifungal segment, with a market share of 15.7 per cent
compared with Monistat's 49.9 per cent.

ASTRA WEIGHS UP BUDESONIDE OPTIONS

Astra Pharmaceuticals has yet to decide on an OTC marketing strategy
for budesonide, the corticosteroid that was cleared for UK sale as a
pharmacy-only medicine for hayfever by the Medicines Control Agency at
the end of last year.

Astra confirmed that a budesonide licence had been issued but would say
no more as yet about how it might proceed with a P version. The company
does not have an OTC division.

The approved indication is for the prevention and treatment of seasonal
allergic rhinitis in adults and children aged over 12 years (OTC
Business News Vol 2, Issue 29, page 7).

Astra sells budesonide on prescription in the UK for the treatment of
perennial, allergic and vasomotor rhinitis in nasal aerosol and nasal
spray formulations (as Rhinocort and Rhinocort Aqua respectively). The
UK P licence is for non-aerosol administration.

NEW DRUGSTORES FORMAT PAYING OFF AT LLOYDS?

Despite a 3.5 per cent decline in like-for-like sales by its troubled
drugstores division in the second quarter, those stores already
operating under the new health and beauty format "registered higher
numbers of customers and increased sales" against the same quarter of
1994, said Lloyds Chemists.

The UK company took a #13.4 million provision last year to reorganise
its Supersave chain, which recorded a #3.7 million loss before tax in
the year to June 1995 compared with a #1.2 million profit in 1993/94
(OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 33, page 8).

The re-think involved closing more than one third of the Supersave
outlets, converting some of them into the more fruitful Holland &
Barrett format (like-for-like sales up 10.3 per cent in the second
quarter), and incorporating some 175 stores into the chemists division
with a health and beauty profile.

Without adjustment for closures, drugstore sales were down by 29.1 per
cent in the first and 45.9 per cent in the second quarter of 1995/96.
In the half year to December, sales through the drugstores fell by 37.9
per cent to #29.6 million (the like-for-like decline was 6 per cent).

The overall picture was happier for Lloyds: total sales rose by 2.4 per
cent and 2.1 per cent in the quarter and half year respectively. Like-
for-like sales in the chemists division were 5.9 per cent ahead (+0.9
per cent in the first quarter), with growth in both prescription and
cash sales.

BELGIAN INDUSTRY FEARS BLOCK ON ADVERTS

OTC companies in Belgium fear the new system of approval for television
and radio advertisements may be so restrictive that many adverts will
never reach the screen.

The system, introduced last year to bring Belgium into line with the
European Union's advertising Directive (92/28/EEC), means OTC
manufacturers can now legally advertise their products nationwide,
formalising what had already been common practice at regional level.

But advertisements must be approved before they can be broadcast. A new
body, the Commission de Controle de la publicite des medicaments
(commission for the control of medicines advertising), is charged with
vetting adverts and then making recommendations to the Minister of
Public Health on whether they may be screened (OTC Business News Vol 1,
Issue 23, page 1).

During its first two months of operation, the commission is believed to
have given positive recommendations on several advertisements. However,
the Minister may still disregard the commission's advice and refuse to
grant screening authorisations.

Ministerial opposition

Fears that this might happen have been given credence by recent
ministerial statements voicing opposition to any advertising of OTC
products on television. One industry source commented that the
government may do everything in its power to make advertising as
difficult as possible.

But with the first advertising 'visas' likely to be granted within the
next few weeks, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry association, AGIM,
is adopting a "wait and see" approach.

The new procedures are likely to continue coming under attack from OTC
companies, which object in principle to the prior approval requirement
for advertisements.

And, as a Belgian source noted, the system is a headache for companies
that want to run pan-European advertising campaigns.

The costs of the vetting procedure, which are met by prospective
advertisers, have also come under fire - particularly the charge of
BFr25,000 ($846) for the renewal of a two-year advertising licence.

As the source commented: "It's just a question of putting the right
stamp on the right papers."

IBUPROFEN AND CLOTRIMAZOLE NOW OFFICIALLY GSL

Ibuprofen and topical clotrimazole are now formally cleared for general
over-the-counter sale in the UK.

Amendments to the General Sale Order releasing the ingredients from
pharmacy-only (P) control in specified strengths and quantities went
through on 29 December 1995, taking effect from 1 January 1996.

This was despite strong reservations voiced by UK pharmacists and their
representatives, who have raised concerns about unsupervised use of
ibuprofen and clotrimazole leading to drug interactions or serious side-
effects in special cases such as asthmatics.

The amendments were put out for consultation last summer after
pharmacists' hackles were raised by a temporary GSL approval
unexpectedly granted to Galpharm's 200mg ibuprofen tablets (OTC
Business News Vol 2, Issue 26, page 1).

Pharmacist resentment has already prompted two companies to backtrack
on plans to launch GSL versions of ibuprofen, although Crookes
Healthcare (Boots), the UK brand leader with Nurofen, has held firm to
its intention of entering the grocery market.

In September Zyma Healthcare (Ciba), which had already secured a
temporary exemption from pharmacy-only status, decided to restrict its
ibuprofen brand, Proflex, to pharmacy distribution. Subsequently
Dendron announced that it would maintain its topical ibuprofen,
Ibuleve, as a pharmacy-only product.

The UK Medicines Control Agency (MCA) recently held out an olive branch
to pharmacists by proposing to establish a standardised P-to-GSL
procedure, similar to that already operating for POM-to-P switches -
although this concept is opposed by the OTC industry on confidentiality
grounds (OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 33, page 10).

GSL specifications

The GSL amendments specify that ibuprofen for oral administration must
be limited to adults and children aged over 12 years, and that: the
indications are for rheumatic and muscular pain, backache, neuralgia,
migraine, headache, dental pain, dysmenorrhea, feverishness and
symptoms of cold and influenza; the maximum dose is 400mg; and the
maximum daily dose is 1200mg.

The 12 years and over stipulation also applies to topical ibuprofen
when on general sale. Additional restrictions are that the indications
are for relief of rheumatic pain and muscular aches, and of pains and
swellings such as strains, sprains and sports injuries; the maximum
strength is 5 per cent; the maximum dose is 125mg; and the maximum
daily dose is 500mg.

GSL clotrimazole is limited to external use. The indication must be for
athlete's foot and the maximum strength 1 per cent.

The MCA has also specified maximum pack or container sizes for the new
GSL medicines: 12 X 200mg units for oral ibuprofen; not more than 2.5mg
per pack for topical ibuprofen; and not more than 500mg per pack for
topical clotrimazole.

Questioned wisdom

John Ferguson, secretary and registrar of the Royal Pharmaceutical
Society of Great Britain, questioned the wisdom of adding further
medicines to the General Sale List.

UK law recognised that the public should have ready access to informed
advice when considering whether to use a non-prescription drug, he
said, adding that this was particularly important for people suffering
from certain medical conditions and for pregnant women.

Citing concerns about ibuprofen's potential to provoke asthma attacks
even at low doses, he asked who would offer advice on side-effects or
drug interactions "at the supermarket checkout or garage forecourt".

Moreover, Mr Ferguson said, he could not see the justification for
wider availability of clotrimazole, as athlete's foot was unlikely to
require urgent attention. There was also a risk of people buying GSL
clotrimazole products to treat other fungal infections, "for which, in
law, they would still need to be obtained from a pharmacy so that
professional advice would be available".

"This is a serious issue with implications for the management and
enforcement of the licensing of medicines in this country. The Society
is looking for clarification on how the government intends to ensure
that conditions attached to the licences for these products are
enforced", Mr Ferguson stated.

The MCA insisted, however, that the patient information leaflets (PILs)
now mandatory with new or amended medicines licences would provide a
buffer against misuse. Licensed GSL medicines are obliged to carry
safety information either on packaging or a PIL.

The licensing authority has also cleared for general sale a higher dose
of folic acid (500mcg as opposed to the current ceiling of 400mcg); and
various minor ingredients such as benzoin tincture compound in pastille
form, equisetum, magnesium alginate, choline bitartrate, capsicum
oleoresin and capsicum (water soluble).

Nurofen imminent

The MCA has seen a growing number of applications for GSL ibuprofen.
Crookes Healthcare told OTC Business News that it obtained a temporary
approval for Nurofen (ie, by the same route as Galpharm) in the week of
12 December 1995.

GSL Nurofen will be on the shelves soon, the company said. The patient
leaflet will include full information on side-effects and
contra indications, in line with the provision for P Nurofen, it added.

Branded versions of 1 per cent clotrimazole on the UK OTC market are
Bayer Consumer Care's Canesten Cream and Crookes Healthcare's more
recent line extension, Mycil Gold Clotrimazole.

Both companies, however, said they had no current plans to move their
products into the GSL sector.

An application to market GSL clotrimazole was made by Scholl Consumer
Products, which already sells a range of treatments for athlete's foot
in the UK containing 1 per cent tolnaftate.

The company confirmed to OTC Business News that it had secured approval
for GSL clotrimazole, and said it was reviewing whether to take the
licence further. A decision is expected shortly.

WHICH? SLAMS PHARMACISTS AGAIN

Which? magazine has once again taken UK pharmacists to task over their
supervision of pharmacy (P) medicine sales.

In their latest snap survey, the Consumers Association (CA) researchers
found that nearly half the pharmacy staff approached "sold the wrong
drugs or failed to give the right advice", Which? said.

The CA has decided to oppose any further prescription-to-OTC switches
until it is confident that its concerns about P medicine supervision
have been fully addressed.

Although the issue has been bubbling under since Which? ran its last
critical report in June 1994 (OTC Business News Vol 1, Issue 1, page
14), this was the second time in less than a month that consumer
research had cast doubt on the protocols for P medicine sales
introduced at the beginning of 1995.

Shortly before Christmas, a radio broadcast by the BBC consumer
programme, You and Yours, drew similarly damning conclusions about
protocol adherence after running tests at 40 pharmacies around the UK.

But pharmacy representatives, while admitting that some of the findings
are cause for concern,
have attacked the surveys as failing to grasp
the realities of the pharmacist/consumer relationship.

Nurofen test

Five (anonymous) Which? researchers were sent to 10 pharmacies around
the UK with specific brand or treatment requests as well as a prepared
history of symptoms and concomitant drug use.

With Crookes Healthcare's Nurofen, the test was predicated on the
potential of ibuprofen to interact with methotraxate, a prescription
drug for psoriasis, or to aggravate the symptoms of asthma.

The researcher was told to say, if asked, that she did not suffer from
asthma but was taking other medication. If further questioned, she was
instructed to say she was on methotraxate.

Seven out of 10 pharmacies wrongly sold the researcher Nurofen, Which?
reported. In two of these no questions were asked, while in one a sales
assistant enquired whether the customer was on medication but did not
ask what it was, and subsequently sold her Nurofen.

In three of the outlets the pharmacist was involved in the interaction
and was aware that the researcher was taking methotraxate, but still
sold her Nurofen. The researcher was asked if she suffered from asthma
in six of the pharmacies.

The pharmacist was alerted to the request for a P medicine in only five
of the eight cases where the researcher was served by a sales
assistant, Which? added.

These findings are particularly worrying in view of the decision to
allow ibuprofen to go on general sale, the magazine commented (see
separate story on page 6).

It agrees with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain
(RPSGB) that ibuprofen should remain subject to pharmacist supervision.
"However, our research shows that, even in pharmacies, it's often being
sold without these safety checks", Which? said.

Crookes Healthcare, noted that the failings highlighted by Which?
largely concerned pharmacy assistants. The issue of P medicine
supervision was being looked at constantly, and the company would work
to ensure both that assistants understood their role and that this role
was made easy for them, it said.

Canesten let-down

Three versions of Bayer's Canesten are available across the pharmacy
counter in the UK: a 500mg clotrimazole pessary and a 10 per cent
cream, both for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis (thrush); and a 1
per cent cream, for the external treatment of fungal and candidal skin
infections.

Bayer recently supplemented these with the Canesten Combi pack (one
pessary plus a tube of 1 per cent cream) for treating both the cause
and symptoms of thrush.

First-time sufferers should be referred to a GP before being sold
Canesten or other OTC products for thrush. "If there are other symptoms
that are not the normal symptoms of thrush, like pain in the lower
abdomen, there could be a more serious problem, such as pelvic
inflammatory disease, which would need treatment by a GP", Which?
noted.

The magazine's researcher asked for Canesten by name but did not
specify which version she wanted or what it was for. She was detailed
to say, if asked, that she had not used Canesten before, nor had
experienced these symptoms previously. If referred to the pharmacist,
the researcher was to say (again, if asked) that she had not consulted
her GP and that the symptoms included lower stomach pain.

In only one out of 10 cases was the researcher referred to her GP -
after the sales assistant serving her had consulted the pharmacist. In
the one instance where she was served by the pharmacist, the researcher
was asked about her symptoms and described lower stomach pain, but was
not referred to a doctor.

In nine out of 10 cases the researcher was not asked whether she had
used Canesten before. Two of the pharmacy assistants asked no questions
at all before selling the product, Which? found.

In five cases the only question asked by the sales assistant was
whether the customer wanted Canesten cream or pessary. In six cases the
researcher was sold the Canesten 1 per cent cream, "which is the least
effective preparation for treating thrush", the magazine said.

Which? described its findings as "deplorable", commenting that "staff
in all but one of these pharmacies let their customers down badly".

Bayer Consumer Care said it had recognised ever since the original OTC
Canesten was launched that the product required proper consultation.
The company had invested a "huge amount of time and money" in training
courses and distance learning packs for pharmacy staff.

Bayer ran its own anonymous survey at around the same time as the first
Which? report and discovered some confusion in pharmacies about which
version of Canesten to sell. The company had stepped up its training at
that point and would be doing "more of the same", it told OTC Business
News.

It noted that the new Canesten Combi pack, which it says is the most
appropriate format for treating thrush, is performing very well and
appears to be clarifying the issue of product choice for pharmacists.

Tagamet better

Tagamet 100 fared somewhat better, although there was "still plenty of
room for improvement", Which? cautioned.

The exercise was again premised on the potential for drug interactions
- in this case with the anti-asthmatic, phyllocontin. It also picked up
on fears that indigestion in the middle-aged and elderly may be a
pointer to gastric cancer.

The researcher, a middle-aged man, was detailed to tell the pharmacist
or sales assistant that he had not taken Tagamet before nor had
previously suffered from indigestion. This was his first attack and it
had been coming and going for a week.

If asked about other medication, the researcher was to mention
phyllocontin. "The pharmacist should have told him to go and see his
GP. In the meantime, he should not have been sold Tagamet - if any drug
was suggested, it should have been an alternative", Which? said.

In the event, only two out of 10 pharmacists sold the researcher
Tagamet 100 - one without asking any questions and the other despite
being told that the customer was on phyllocontin. Seven pharmacists
offered an alternative to the brand and one refused to sell any drug,
telling the researcher to see his doctor immediately.

Five of the pharmacists instructed the researcher to see a doctor if
his symptoms persisted. But in four cases the pharmacist failed to ask
whether the customer had suffered indigestion before and did not refer
him to a GP.

Diarrhoea/hayfever

Another Which? researcher asked for advice on how to treat diarrhoea.
If questioned, he described symptoms that had persisted for a few weeks
and told pharmacy staff he had recently visited South East Asia - at
which point, Which? said, "he should have been sent to a doctor
immediately. Oral rehydration salts might have helped but anti-
diarrhoeal drugs would not have been much use."

The researcher was "asked all the relevant questions" and told to see a
GP in seven out of 10 cases. In one other instance he was told to visit
his doctor if the symptoms did not abate.

In two of these eight cases the pharmacist or sales assistant refused
to sell the Which? researcher any medicine. In four cases he was sold
oral rehydration salts, in one Imodium (a prescription-to-OTC switch of
loperamide), and in another both Arret (also loperamide) and oral
rehydration salts.

In two cases the customer was not referred to a GP and was simply sold
Imodium.

A hayfever enquiry was designed to test whether someone taking the
antidepressant, amitriptyline, would be steered away from Triludan
(terfenadine), since the two drugs in combination can aggravate heart
problems.

The researcher sought a recommendation for hayfever and in five out of
10 cases, the sales assistant failed to establish that another drug was
being used.

Triludan was sold in five cases, in two of these despite the pharmacist
knowing that the customer was taking amitriptyline. The sales assistant
discussed the request with a pharmacist in six cases.

Pharmacists in crisis?

Under the headline "Pharmacists in crisis", Which? commented: "We have
criticised pharmacists in the past for failing to protect consumers
from the dangers of non-prescription drugs. Unfortunately the service
is still not measuring up ... and now it matters more than ever."

"More and more drugs are coming off prescription and being heavily
promoted by the drug industry", Which? said. "At the same time, over-
secretive licensing laws do not allow the public to know whether such
moves are safe for consumers."

Which? encouraged consumers, in the absence of intervention, to
describe their symptoms to pharmacists as well as any action taken and
whether they were already on medication or had a pre-existing medical
condition.

This advice was welcomed by the RPSGB, which in a statement noted that
pharmacists trying to implement the new protocols "meet with resistance
and in some cases even hostility from some customers who do not wish to
discuss their symptoms".

The pharmacists' body did not agree, however, with all the conclusions
of the Which? report, saying: "In some cases the report had been
critical of the level and content of advice given and of the provision
of products that it would have been perfectly proper for the pharmacist
to supply in all circumstances."

In fact, the survey showed that "the public could have confidence in
the service provided by pharmacists, who in order to help them provide
the best service were now clearly asking for more information from
people requesting a medicine by name", the Society maintained.

It was concerned, however, by the cases where pharmacists appeared to
be asking no questions at all.

Professional judgment

Roger Odd, head of the RPSGB's practice division, said pharmacists had
to make their own assessment of specific cases, in the same way as
doctors. The P medicine protocols were there to provide guidance only.

Nonetheless, the Society is reviewing the protocol situation to make
sure pharmacy staff are aware which questions they should or should not
be asking, Mr Odd told OTC Business News. But the RPSGB does not
anticipate amending the guidelines in the light of the Which? report.

The Society's position was supported by Boots The Chemists (BTC), the
largest pharmacy chain in the UK - although it noted that no Boots
outlets were mentioned in the Which? report.

"The introduction of new protocols in all Boots pharmacies, backed up
by intensive training of all our pharmacy and healthcare staff, is a
major priority for us and we invest in excess of #4 million per year on
Healthcare training", BTC stated.

It also stressed that pharmacists had to use their professional
judgment rather than automatically running through a list of questions.

Customers give out "visual signals" in their interaction with counter
staff, and quite often these will be at least observed by a pharmacist,
commented public relations manager Sharon Buckle. Moreover, if
consumers asked for a specific product, they need not necessarily be
quizzed on whether they had taken it before.

The feedback from BTC's own stores and customers was that the
pharmacist's role was highly valued, Ms Buckle told OTC Business News.

GERMAN PHARMACY SALES UP 3.7 PER CENT

The German market for OTC medicines sold via pharmacies grew by 3.7 per
cent to DM7 billion ($4.9 billion) between September 1994 and August
1995.

Direct supply by manufacturers bypassing wholesalers accounted for 14.9
per cent of the sales by value and 22.5 per cent by volume, according
to data given in the annual report of Anzag.

In its pharmacy business the German wholesaler focuses particularly on
the OTC sector and is hence facing competition from manufacturers that
opt for direct delivery of non-prescription drugs.

However, direct OTC business in Germany declined by 1.4 per cent to DM1
billion at manufacturers' prices last year, Anzag said.

Overall, the pharmaceutical wholesale market expanded by 7.2 per cent
to DM27.3 billion (excluding value added tax) in the year to August
1995, according to Anzag's figures. Growth was more pronounced in
eastern Germany (up 8.2 per cent to DM5.1 billion) than in the western
part of the country (DM22.2 billion, +6.9 per cent).

Anzag's share

Anzag's share of the total wholesale market stands at 16.1 per cent. It
expects to see its turnover lift by 3-4 per cent in the current
financial year, as the German market recovers from the negative impact
of the healthcare reform legislation introduced in 1993.

The company recorded profit after tax of DM32.3 million in 1994/95 -
slightly down on the DM33 million achieved in the previous year - on
turnover of DM4.06 billion.

Peter Haac, chairman of the Anzag board, said the company would further
develop the marketing services it offers to pharmacists.

Of the 8,000 pharmacies supplied by Anzag, 2,000 make use of the
company's marketing package, which combines the delivery of selected
OTC medicines, display materials and customer leaflets with Anzag's
advertising campaigns.

Anzag has been beefing up its OTC advertising strategies since 1994,
mostly through pharmacy displays but also in the print media.

GROWTH SLOWING IN UK MEDICATED SKINCARE?

The UK market for medicated skincare products is maturing, and growth
is expected to slow from an impressive 39.2 per cent in 1990-1994 to
five per cent in the years to the end of the decade.

UK sales reached #89 million in 1994 and should climb to #95 million by
the year 2000, according to a new report by MarketLine, Global
Medicated Skincare.

The surge in value during 1990-94 was largely driven by acne remedies
and therapeutic moisturisers, respectively the largest (37.6 per cent
of total sales) and second-largest (30.5 per cent) segments of the
medicated skincare market, MarketLine says.

Therapeutic moisturisers have been particularly dynamic, growing by a
cumulative 81.3 per cent over the five-year period, but both categories
have been gaining market share at the expense of antifungals, anti-
itching products and haemorrhoid treatments.

MarketLine gives the following estimates for sales and growth by
category in 1990-94:

In the acne remedies segment, Clearasil is the brand leader in a
concentrated market where the top three manufacturers account for more
than 90 per cent of sales.

"Smaller brands are suffering as a result of strong brand recognition
of the major acne remedies and the heavy advertising used to support
such products", MarketLine comments.

It adds that market concentration and the brand loyalties built up
among teenagers generally make for rather static brand shares.

Clearasil, Biactol and Oxy are all advertising heavily to build market
share, the researchers note. They give the following data on
advertising expenditure in the UK medicated skincare market during 1993-
94:

MarketLine believes therapeutic moisturisers will remain the most
energetic segment of the UK market over the next five years.

"Growth in this sector will be due mainly to a move towards premium
products", the researchers predict.
Sluggish performers

The most sluggish performers will be acne remedies, because of a lack
of new products in this area, they say.

FDA APPROVAL FOR ZANTAC SWITCH

Glaxo Wellcome's Zantac is poised to become the third H2-antagonist
option for US consumers in the OTC market for heartburn.

The Food and Drug Administration approved OTC Zantac late last year and
the product will be launched sometime during the first quarter of 1996.

It will be marketed as Zantac 75 (ranitidine hydrochloride 75mg) by
Warner Wellcome Consumer Healthcare in packs of four, 10, and 20
tablets.

Zantac was the third H2-antagonist to be approved for OTC use by the
FDA during 1995: Johnson & Johnson/Merck's Pepcid AC (famotidine) was
cleared on 28 April and SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet HB (cimetidine) on
19 June.

Warner Wellcome is confident, however, that a late start will not deter
it from becoming the market leader.

"The world's leading prescription H2-antagonist over the last five
years is now poised to take its rightful place in the over-the-counter
heartburn market", said Robert Casale, vice president, gastrointestinal
marketing.

$250 million potential

Zantac has generated 200 million prescriptions in the US since 1983 and
Warner Wellcome expects the OTC version to be among those drugs most
frequently recommended by pharmacists.

The product could bring in sales of around $250 million by the end of
the decade, according to UK analysts Paul Krikler and Mark Tracey of
Goldman Sachs International.

They believe Tagamet HB sales in the US are running at "a spectacular
rate of $3 million per week", slightly behind Pepcid AC.

"Broadly speaking, these products have expanded the roughly $1 billion
US market for OTC acid-disease remedies by around 40 per cent to 50 per
cent since their launch earlier this year. We expect further share
gains for these newer products, although this may increasingly come at
the expense of the non-H2-antagonist therapies", the analysts comment.

The Zantac 75 launch will be propelled by the biggest marketing
campaign in Warner Wellcome's history. US advertising is being handled
by J Walter Thompson.

The OTC joint venture expects to repeat its success with Zantac 75 in
the UK market, where sales have overtaken both Pepcid AC and Tagamet
100 despite Zantac being introduced almost a year later than its
competitors.

By its fifth month on the UK market, Zantac had captured a 50 per cent
share of the OTC H2-antagonist segment.

Consumer expectation

Mr Casale noted that US sales of OTC stomach remedies over a 22-week
period rose by 27 per cent after the H2s became available without
prescription. "We expect that growth will continue with the
introduction of Zantac 75", he said.

"Our research has shown that heartburn sufferers are looking forward to
buying a product with the characteristics of Zantac 75: wide
acceptance, prescription heritage and familiarity. We expect that high
consumer expectation will translate into even higher retailer
excitement", Mr Casale commented.

The recommended dose for adults and children aged 12 years and over is
one 75mg tablet, not to exceed two tablets in 24 hours. Zantac 75 will
have no interaction warnings (unlike Tagamet HB) and, when used as
directed, can be taken at the maximum dose daily for up to two weeks.

The Zantac 75 approval came just as Warner-Lambert signed a letter of
intent to purchase Glaxo Wellcome's interest in the Warner Wellcome
joint venture for $1.05 billion (OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 36,
page 1).

The companies are also restructuring their marketing alliance for Glaxo
Wellcome's prescription-to-OTC switches, including Zantac. Profits and
marketing costs will continue to be split 50:50, with Glaxo Wellcome
receiving a royalty on sales.

SIX US SWITCHES IN 1995

The US Food and Drug Administration was remarkably active in approving
prescription-to-OTC switches during l995.

Six prescription drugs, the largest number in over a decade, were
granted approval to switch to OTC status. 1996 also looks promising, as
four drugs have been recommended for OTC switching by FDA advisory
committees.

Stomach remedies led the switch list in 1995, with three winning
approval, followed by two internal analgesics and one treatment for
vaginal yeast infection.

28 September 1995.

* Nicorette, SmithKline Beecham's nicotine gum (2mg and 4mg, licensed
from Pharmacia & Upjohn), recommended on 28 September 1995.

* Pharmacia & Upjohn's hair regrowth treatment, Rogaine (minoxidil 2
per cent), recommended for approval on 17 November 1995.

The dandruff shampoo, ketoconazole, is also awaiting FDA approval. It
was cleared for switching by the agency's advisors on 16 February 1994.

FDA SITS OUT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

The US Food and Drug Administration's OTC drug office had a remarkably
quiet Christmas holiday season. No announcements were made, no meetings
scheduled, no rules promulgated and no enforcement actions reported.

But the inactivity was not, as many thought, a symptom of the historic
US government shutdown, which affected the Department of Health and
Human Services.
History the reason

"History is the reason", explained Don McLearn, FDA deputy associate
commissioner  for public affairs.

The agency's budget falls under the Department of Agriculture, one of
the few departments to receive an appropriation, and the FDA has hence
been fully operational.

While the agency's positioning within the executive branch has been
altered to the relevant departments of health (Health, Education and
Welfare - now the Department of Health and Human Services), its budget
has stayed under agriculture.

The powerful chairs of the Congressional agricultural appropriations
committees have fought successfully over the years to retain
jurisdiction over the FDA budget - primarily to ensure that the agency
would remain concerned with food adulteration and insecticides.
Essential employees

Mr McLearn seemed pleased to explain the FDA's budgetary history rather
than answer the many enquiries he has received about the "essential
nature" of its employees.

The government shutdown required essential workers to report to their
agencies while others were furloughed.

The FDA's critics apparently thought the budget standoff gave them a
chance to learn how many of the agency's employees were 'inessential'.

WHOSE STANDARDS? ADVERTISING IN SOUTH EAST ASIA

If the growth surge in South East Asia has created a ready market for
premium-priced western OTC brands, reaching the consumers with new
money in their pockets can be an uphill struggle.

It is not just a question of geography and the unevenness of
distribution routes across the region. Multinationals complain that
their competitive edge in what consultant Nicholas Hall calls the
"world's fastest growing OTC market" is blunted by cumbersome,
unpredictable and paternalistic controls on advertising.

In common with other regions where a western-style OTC sector is only
just beginning to coalesce, and 'self-prescription' is rife, there are
wide divergences in both the range of products that can be advertised
to the public and the claims that can be made on them.

But one consistent feature of the South East Asian markets is a
preference for pre-vetting of OTC adverts.

Marketers of international brands claim these systems are non-
transparent (and, by implication, protectionist), bureaucratic and
corrupt, with some adverts taking anything from two to eight months to
gain clearance: a potentially disastrous scenario when it comes to
scheduling product launches.

It was hardly surprising, then, to see so much energy spent at the
WFPMM's 2nd Asia Pacific Regional Meeting in Bangkok on promoting the
kind of self-regulatory and message-led framework now installed in the
majority of western markets.
Different priorities?

It could be argued that the health authorities in Thailand and other
South East Asian countries have different priorities from their
counterparts in the more developed OTC markets - that what appears
paternalistic in Western eyes is inextricable from issues of education,
awareness, wealth distribution and regulatory enforcement.

As Margaretha Helling-Borda, director of the World Health
Organisation's (WHO) Action Programme on Essential Drugs, said in
Bangkok, self-medication is about a "whole matrix" of socio-economic
and health factors affecting purchase.

Some, however, view the advertising restrictions in South East Asia as
bureaucracy pure and simple.

One country manager commented to OTC Business News: "In my opinion
external factors such as literacy are not a barrier to a more liberal
advertising environment. Instead, the bureaucracy ... is locked in
regulations which relate to historical accident more than any realistic
assessment of the level of development of consumers."

Moreover, there is a fear that governments in South East Asia may
offset encouragement of self-medication with demands for comprehensive
advertising information on ingredients, usage, side-effects, etc, under
the influence of the WHO's ethical criteria for drug promotion - taking
the opposite path from European countries that have moved to eliminate
full disclosure requirements.

The international industry says the WHO guidelines were formulated by
doctors and largely for doctor, not consumer, promotion. And the
prevalence of doctor dispensing in South East Asia means the profession
has a direct financial stake in resisting any swing to self-medication.

Against disclosure

The arguments against full disclosure were marshalled in Bangkok by
Peter Glynn-Jones, chairman of the WFPMM and managing director,
strategic development for SmithKline Beecham Consumer Healthcare.

OTC advertising can at best convey one or two messages such as the name
and function of the product, he said. Research proves that it is "just
not possible" to inform consumers about contra indications or side-
effects through adverts, Mr Glynn-Jones maintained.

Last August the Pharmaceutical Producers Association of Thailand (PPA)
sponsored an advertisising research project at the Chulalongkorn
University Faculty of Communication Arts. This found that Thai
consumers responded favourably to an "always read the label" direction
on adverts for SmithKline Beecham's cold remedy, Contac 400.

Two other versions of the ad carried either no written instruction or
the full text of labelling for Contac 400 (which is a prescription-only
medicine in Thailand).

On a mean scale, the "read the label" version drew the most positive
reaction in the poll, in which each advert was viewed by 200 out of a
total 600 selected Bangkok residents of mixed age, income, education,
etc.

Nonetheless, 83 per cent of all the respondents saw advantages in
having written texts in OTC adverts (52 per cent of these because they
"provide the right way to take a medicine"), while 72 per cent
identified disadvantages (39 per cent of them because of "too much
information").

This suggests avenues for further research on exactly how much
information is desirable in advertising. At the same time, the
researchers found that 97 per cent of the Bangkok poll obtained medical
information through reading product labelling.
Carte blanche

At present Thailand has no full disclosure requirement for OTC
advertisements. But the broad regulatory authority invested in the Thai
Food and Drug Administration is seen as giving the agency carte blanche
to clamp down on the expressive devices - music, testimonials, 'before'
and 'after' images, depictions of discomfort - conventionally employed
by OTC advertisers in the west.

Exacerbating these restrictions, local sources say, is a refusal to
consider precedents when reviewing advertising applications. Moreover,
any problems that emerge must be cleared up before the FDA will proceed
with the review, adding months to the approval timetable.

At the same time, OTC Business News was told, some companies sidestep
the controls by advertising live on radio in rural areas. "The
international companies feel bound to obey the regulations but the
local companies are more entrepreneurial", one executive commented.

From a multinational perspective, the Philippines offers the most
palatable system. Again there is pre-control but it is administered by
a review board that includes representatives of advertisers as well as
consumer groups, and works with predetermined criteria (eg, are the
claims technically supportable, in good taste, non-disparaging).

The board meets several nights a week and reviews are generally
completed in a single session. An appeals procedure is available if
objections arise once the advertisement has gone public.

Otherwise experience is mixed. Singapore and Malaysia are regarded as
relatively unproblematic, with similar committee systems to the
Philippines if a slightly less brisk turnover of applications. Vietnam
does not regulate veracity or accuracy of advertising content but
applies 'political' censorship.

The divergence of allowable claims or images - for example, an advert
for a stomach remedy may conclude with a smiling customer in one
country and impassively in another if 'relief' cannot be shown -
inevitably adds to the cost of reworking material from market to
market.

Longer-term dividends

For those manufacturers that can build brand loyalty in South East
Asia, the longer-term dividends could be substantial.

Addressing a meeting last summer of the Proprietary Medicines
Association of Australia in Canberra, Mr Hall, chairman and chief
executive officer of Nicholas Hall and Company, predicted that the
total OTC market in South East Asia would double to around $6 billion
by 2004, with growth (from a relatively small base) of 305 per cent in
China and 211 per cent in Indonesia.

A recent report by Euromonitor estimates that the market has expanded
by 46 per cent since 1990, with the Philippines showing the fastest
rate of growth (132.3 per cent) followed by Thailand (110.7 per cent)
and Indonesia (80.9 per cent).

But it would take a hardened optimist to expect any rapid shift towards
a harmonised environment for OTC advertisers in South East Asia. As yet
there is little indication of any regional pattern in drug regulatory
trends.

For example, Singapore's move to switch some 80 medicines from
prescription- to pharmacy-only status, and to make an even larger group
available for general sale, appears an isolated case. In other South
East Asian markets the tendency is still to restrict fairly routine OTC
ingredients to prescription-only use.

One problem, local observers say, is the insularity of drug regulators
in the region. And since the OTC market is as often as not something of
an undefined quantity, there is little incentive to look at how it
operates in other countries.

Moreover, the kind of state-funded healthcare systems that are now
weighing heavily on government finances in Europe have not been the
norm in South East Asia, so there has not been the same economic
rationale for stimulating self-care.

A standardised split into prescription and non-prescription drug
categories might clear some space to define new rules for advertising
OTCs. But the adoption of anything approaching European-style
classification could be years away.

The Thai regulators, for their part, show little sign of modifying the
country's two-stream system of 'dangerous' and 'non-dangerous' drugs.

Non-dangerous products are effectively OTC in Thailand, since they can
be advertised to the general public. But the PPA would rather see a
separate category for self-medication, with formalised procedures for
advertising, labelling, packaging and patient information.

Industry observers say the 'dangerous' classification is a misnomer as
long as products such as oral contraceptives and psychotropics are
freely available in Thai pharmacies.
Global harmonisation?

Even in the European Union, where the advertising Directive (92/28/EEC)
adopted in 1992 has generally liberalised the conditions for OTC
marketers, some member states such as Belgium have clung onto their pre-
control authority in regulating adverts for OTC medicines (this was one
element that the Directive left to national discretion).

Summing up the European regulatory achievements in Bangkok and noting
their considerable impact on legislative reform in Central and Eastern
Europe, Dr Hubertus Cranz, director of the European OTC association,
AESGP, asked if these experiences might not be applied on a global
scale.

In the past, harmonisation in the self-medication market has been
complicated by the strong influence of traditional medicines, Dr Cranz
commented. However, over the last decade the balance has tipped towards
more 'international' OTCs, particularly in the light of consolidation
within the industry and the large market shares captured by
prescription-to-OTC switches.

Dr Cranz suggested that a viable route to worldwide harmonisation might
be standard-setting through guidelines that could be used as the basis
for national procedures. The WFPMM had long since embarked on this
process, through its Guidelines on Drug Promotion.

But it was particularly important that the political climate was right
for broadening the context of harmonisation, he added. "Therefore it is
significant that the WHO recently reinforced its position on the
importance of responsible self-medication and enlarged its statements
on the appropriate use of non-prescription medicines", Dr Cranz said
(see OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 29, page 15).

Nonetheless, he was cautious about the prospects for harmonisation of
advertising regulations.

A great deal of research has been conducted on "reasonable" rules for
advertising OTC products and in particular on the information that can
be conveyed through adverts, he noted.

"Again, in the sense of standard-setting, it might be worth taking
such rules as a basis for considerations in countries which have often,
due to their tradition, been more restrictive", Dr Cranz proposed.

But, he went on to state, there are "certainly many areas in the
regulatory environment of non-prescription medicines which are not
suitable for harmonisation; particularly evident are the areas of
distribution of OTC medicines ... or the systems controlling public OTC
advertising."

A similarly pragmatic line was taken in a panel discussion by Dr Jerome
Reinstein, director general of the WFPMM, who advised against
developing countries moving immediately to a self-regulatory system of
advertising control.

This required the agreement of trade association members to a set of
standards and codes, and some industry associations were not yet strong
or unified enough to achieve this, he commented.

(So far Australia and New Zealand are the only countries in the Asia
Pacific region that have a discrete OTC industry association - Ed).

Moreover, governments in emerging OTC markets must feel that "industry
has earned the right to self-regulation", Dr Reinstein said.
Gulf in interests

The issue is further muddied by the gulf between local and
multinational interests in `developing' markets.

One illustration is the adoption of a self-regulatory Code of Marketing
Practices by the Thai PPA in August 1994 (OTC Business News Vol 1,
Issue 5, page 14).

While the Code is undoubtedly closer to international practice (it is a
requirement of WFPMM membership that member associations have their own
effective advertising code), its real impact is questionable. Not only
are the guidelines more lenient than the government regulations in
force but around 80 per cent of the Thai OTC market is controlled by
non-PPA members.

Many of these are local generic players that, over the years, are
likely to have found ways of working with the pre-control system. The
multinational industry is now focusing on issues of product quality and
information provision in a bid to assert the superiority of its brands
over generic competitors.

A similar national/multinational split is seen in the Philippines,
where one local company holds around 25 per cent of the OTC market.
However, in Indonesia the local industry association has agreed to
collaborate with international companies - a far cry from a few years
back when the multinationals were not even allowed to attend local
association meetings.

The Thai PPA also reports some positive signals from the Bangkok
meeting, with Food and Drug Administration officials requesting copies
of presentations and talking about the need to look at OTC developments
in other markets. A new, younger head of the FDA appointed last October
(Prof Dr Pakdee Pothisiri) is seen as another harbinger of a more
international mindset.

Education or persuasion?

The drive towards regulatory harmonisation in Europe was largely a
matter of market access - the free movement of goods as laid down by
the Treaty of Rome. How much, and indeed whether, consumers benefit
from a broader range of OTC products depends on assumptions about their
ability to make informed choices, with appropriate steerage from
pharmacists or, in some cases, doctors.

These issues are more sharply defined in South East Asia, particularly
as in Indonesia, for example, pharmacies are relatively thin on the
ground and an estimated 35-40 per cent of OTC sales go through non-drug
outlets (see OTC Business News Vol 2, Issue 35, page 19).

Mary Murray, who has worked on national drug policies in Australia and
other Asia Pacific markets, warned at the WFPMM meeting that many
consumers in developing countries do not recognise symptoms and rely on
the family unit for guidance. Moreover, both literacy and health
knowledge decline in line with economic status.

And Janne Graham, former chairwoman of the Consumers' Health Forum of
Australia, said recent research in her home country revealed that
people living just above the poverty line had to make "real choices
between medicines and food on a daily basis".

On the contrary, Steven Grossman, senior vice-president and director of
health policy at US advertisers Hill & Knowlton, saw health awareness
benefiting from a more liberal advertising climate.

"I believe that the sophistication of American consumers about health
matters is a result of advertising, not, as some would have it, a
precondition of allowing advertising to occur", he told the meeting.

Mr Grossman went on to argue that wide availability coupled with broad
public knowledge of OTC medicines was likely to check inappropriate
usage - and keep prices down.

"Even when a primary goal of an advertisement is the creation of
immediate product demand, it is usually consistent with public health
goals because the advertising directs the consumer to a product that
resolves their health concern in a safe and effective manner", he said.

Mr Grossman cited a 1992 survey by the Heller Research Group for the US
Non prescription Drug Manufacturers Association, which found that nearly
seven out of 10 respondents preferred, if at all possible, to combat
symptoms without recourse to medication; and that close to nine in 10
US consumers knew medicines should only be taken when absolutely
necessary.

Co-regulation?

But a more co-operative approach to squaring corporate and consumer
interests in OTC advertising was suggested by the Australian system of
pre-clearance.

The committee that assesses compliance with the Proprietary Medicines
Association of Australia's (self-regulatory) Code of Conduct is chaired
by an independent lawyer, with consumer and pharmacy representatives
sitting alongside delegates from the Therapeutic Goods Administration
and the drug industry - not "a committee of our mates", commented PMAA
president David Stephens.

Health consumer groups in Australia had been "naturally suspicious"
about pharmaceutical industry associations monitoring their own
members' compliance with advertising requirements, Ms Graham noted.
Moreover, "there is a real risk from the consumer view that members
will simply resign to avoid sanctions under the code and that outlier
or 'rogue' companies simply will not join", she said.

Two factors, however, had raised confidence in the Australian system,
Ms Graham told the meeting: scrutiny of the PMAA Code of Conduct by the
Trade Practices Commission, which resulted in "the widening of
interests but, most particularly, those of the consumer" on the
compliance committee; and the annual public reporting of complaints and
outcomes.

The co-regulatory spirit manifested in this system and bodies such as
Australian Pharmaceutical Advisory Council (APAC) was borne out in
recent discussions over indirect advertising of non-sedating
antihistamines.

In this case, both industry and consumer groups saw the value of
'generic' public advertising - with an "ask your chemist" message - to
raise awareness of a more advanced treatment option, Ms Graham
explained. (The products' Schedule 3 (pharmacy-only) status did not
permit advertising to the general population.)

It was agreed that a set of guidelines on indirect adverts should be
incorporated into the PMAA Code of Conduct and, to provide regulatory
ballast, eventually be taken up by the Therapeutic Goods Act.

Here, then, was an instance of industry and consumers moving in tandem
to secure mutual benefit from OTC advertising - and pre-empting the
Australian licensing authority, which has yet to respond.

EC FINES BAYER OVER ADALAT PARALLEL IMPORT BAN

Bayer has fallen foul of EU competition rules for trying to impede
parallel imports into the UK of its big-selling antihypertensive Adalat
(nifedipine). The European Commission imposed a fine of ECU3 million
($3.5 million) on 10 January, after deciding that the German
pharmaceuticals producer had infringed the EC Treaty.

The Commission has been investigating trading practices among several
of the group's subsidiaries for some months now, and says that Bayer
has committed a serious infringement of Community law, going back to
the end of the 1980s. Bayer immediately said it would appeal.

This was a classic example of a blatant attempt to limit parallel
imports, explained the Commission as it announced the fine in Brussels.
The prices for Adalat vary widely in the various Member States in which
it is marketed, but Adalat's largest market shares are in the UK, where
its price is considerably higher than in other Member States, notably
France and Spain, it said.

Before 1989 in Spain and 1991 in France, the main customers of the
French and Spanish subsidiaries of Bayer, ie the pharmaceutical
wholesalers in those Member States, used to order larger quantities of
Adalat than they required for supplying the domestic market, and they
then exported the surplus to other Member States, including the UK. But
as from early 1989, Bayer Spain set up a computerised system for
identifying exporting wholesalers, and was refusing to supply them with
all of the quantities of Adalat which they ordered. In September 1991,
French wholesalers also found that Bayer France was no longer prepared
to supply them with their full orders. In the autumn of 1991, a Bayer
Spain executive visited the management of Bayer France, to explain how
this system worked (although in the event, the system set up by Bayer
France for identifying exporting wholesalers remained less elaborate:
handwritten lists were drawn up specifying "do not supply" or "blocked"
for certain orders) .

Wholesalers in France and Spain continued to try to obtain supplies of
Adalat from Bayer over and above their domestic requirements, and
reacted to the manufacturer's blacklisting by using various means to
camouflage their requests so they could continue exporting to the UK.
In particular, wholesalers used a system of spreading orders intended
for export between their various agencies. They also placed orders
through other, small wholesalers not subject to monitoring. The aim was
to appear to comply with Bayer's requirement that the product should
not be exported - but the subterfuges broke down on occasions, and when
one of the wholesalers was found to be exporting, Bayer France and
Bayer Spain imposed their own penalties, making successive reductions
in the volumes supplied.

"All these practices engaged in by Bayer France and Bayer Spain show
that they subjected their wholesalers to a permanent threat of a
reduction in the quantities supplied, a threat which was repeatedly put
into effect if the wholesalers did not comply with the export ban",
says the Commission.

It goes on to point out that the export ban was not just a one-off
exercise, but formed part of the continuous commercial relations
between Bayer France and Bayer Spain and their respective wholesalers -
relations that the wholesalers, both in France and in Spain, clearly
understood, as their conduct shows, says the Commission. This proves
that the company was operating an agreement in breach of Article 85(1)
of the Treaty (which forbids such agreements flatly as being anti-
competitive).

However, the Commission has not imposed the maximum possible fine. EU
rules allow it to fine offenders as much as 10 per cent of their
turnover of the product involved - which ECU3 million certainly is not.
In an interesting aside, the Commission has acknowledged that in
determining the amount of the fine, it has taken account of the fact
that pharmaceutical product prices are not set autonomously by
companies, but are governed by the various relevant national rules and
regulations. This is an unusual Commission admission of the fact that
companies do not necessarily have a level playing field.

Bayer said within hours of the fine being announced that it would take
legal action in the European Court of Justice against the Commission
decision. Bayer "has not categorically violated the legal provisions of
the Treaties of Rome", it says, and "protests at the Commission's
unconventional legal stance in interpreting the anti-trust rules",
which it brands "incomprehensible".

"The Commission's aim is evidently to restrict Bayer's freedom to
decide what quantities of products to sell to which businesses",
complains Bayer, pointing out that compliance with the Commission's
demands for full supply of all wholesalers' requests would
automatically mean parallel importers benefiting.

At the same time as it rejects the Commission's interpretation of EU
rules, Bayer also claims it has in any case not deliberately penalised
wholesalers, while acknowledging that some orders have not been filled.
"As far as capacities allow, Bayer supplies subsidiaries outside
Germany with Adalat or its active ingredient, nifedipine. Supplies are
generally governed by the requirements determined and forecasted by the
subsidiaries for their local markets on the basis of past experience.
In isolated cases, therefore, wholesalers who obviously order more than
they require for the local market may receive lower quantities than
they have ordered".

HOECHST AND RPR FORM CENTEON

The US dominant Rhone-Poulenc Rorer subsidiary Armour Pharmaceutical Co
and the leading European Hoechst subsidiary Behringwerke AG have joined
forces in a 50/50 venture to form Centeon, a $1.2 billion new plasma
protein therapies company employing 4,500 people worldwide to be
headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.

Centeon, headed by former Armour president John Sedor as CEO and
Hoechst managing board member Karl Seifert as chairman, is to become
the largest single supplier of plasma derived products worldwide,
supplying plasma proteins used in coagulation disorders, immune
deficiencies, wound healing, trauma and neurologic disorders. Centeon
should hold a 24 per cent share of the $5 billion plasma products
market, ahead of Baxter, Bayer, Green Cross-Alpha, Immuno and several
smaller players, according to Mr Sedor.

The collaboration has involved Hoechst and RPR contributing all the
plasma protein assets of both Armour and Behringwerke's plasma protein
division. Behringwerke will retain separate diagnostic and vaccine
divisions.

Pooled research budgets of the current companies are to be doubled to
$60 million enabling Centeon to increase investment in R&D and
accelerate the pace of new plasma-derived product development. Its size
also means it can be the global leader in supplying the world's needs
for plasma products.

Both companies are active in Aids research; new research areas that
Centeon will focus on include blood components, rDNA technology and
gene therapy. Emphasis is to be on innovative therapeutics. The company
says it will provide viral safety by combining the largest and most
sophisticated commercial plasma collection and tracking operation in
the world with advanced technology for viral inactivation and
purification of products.

Mr Sedor is predicting average annual sales growth for the company of 7-
10 per cent, double the market's current 3-5 per cent growth rate.

HOECHST RESTRUCTURING TAKES EFFECT

The global restructuring plans announced by Hoechst last December have
now been put into effect commencing 1 January. The plans include a
reorganisation of research activity, establishment of a drug
development centre, a reduction in ingredient production, the shedding
of 8,000 jobs including 1,400 in Germany, and the adoption of a
multicultural marketing approach. Integration between 1995 and 1998
will cost an estimated $800 million but cost savings of $800
million/year will be achieved by 1997 says the company with marketing
and administration efficiencies saving $350 million, R&D $230 million
and manufacturing $20 million. A return on sales of 20 per cent is
forecast for 1997/8 compared with 12 per cent in 1994 and Hoechst's
pharmaceutical business in total is expected to contribute 27 per cent
of the company's DM15 billion sales.

Research activity is to be based at four locations: Frankfurt,
Romainville, France, Somerville, US and Kawagoe, Japan. Research will
focus on eight therapeutic areas; cardiovascular, metabolic disorders
and rheumatology, infectious diseases, bone diseases, CNS, oncology and
respiratory disorders. Research centres at Cincinnati, US, Gerenzano,
Italy, Strasbourg, France and Swindon, UK are to be closed and activity
transferred to the other sites. The natural product screening facility
in India is under review but a decision has been taken to continue
research at HMR's combinatorial chemistry affiliate Selectide in
Tucson, US.

Hoechst's stated aims are to cut costs and launch innovative products
rapidly, using novel marketing methods. Integration of Roussel Uclaf
(56 per cent Hoechst-owned) should be complete by end 1996 and the
expected synergies, cost savings, higher sales and growth potential
from the acquisition of Marion Merrell Dow are expected to start
becoming apparent this year.

ALKERMES TO ACQUIRE MEDISORB

Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company Alkermes Inc has announced it
will acquire the technology and assets of the controlled release drug
delivery leader Medisorb Technologies International of Wilmington,
Ohio.

In doing so, it will provide Alkermes with the wherewithal to
manufacture injectable sustained release formulations of traditional
small molecule pharmaceuticals, complementing Alkermes ProLease drug
delivery system for larger, complex biotechnology compounds.

Alkermes aims to be the leader in injectable sustained drug delivery,
said CEO Richard Pops last week, and the Medisorb acquisition will open
new large markets.

The acquisition is to be financed by a combination of cash and future
payments based on the successful commercial launch of products
incorporating Medisorb's technology, said a company statement. No
Alkermes stock is to be issued to finance the deal.

AMGEN AND SUGEN CONCLUDE RESEARCH COLLABORATION

Sugen Inc and Amgen have agreed to end a four-year research
collaboration into neurobiology and haematopoiesis one year earlier
than planned.

A change of research priorities for both parties have led to the
amicable winding up of the project which was to have identified novel
signal transduction targets for certain neurological and haematopoietic
disorders, say the companies.

Amgen will pay Sugen $2.5 million and grant back to Sugen exclusive
worldwide rights to 22 proprietary signal transduction targets
discovered during the collaboration, subject to royalty payments on
future sales.

Sugen is buying back from Amgen 235,000 shares at $11.48 per share. The
company develops small molecule drugs which interact with key signal
transduction molecules known as tyrosine kinases and phosphatases.
Signalling pathways for the molecules are involved in a number of human
diseases including cancer and diabetes.

BRACCO TO EXPAND EASTWARDS

Bracco, the Italian pharmaceutical company has announced it intends to
expand its Chinese and Russian interests this year. The company has
recently been concentrating on penetrating the US market.

Bracco, which last year purchased Squibb Diagnostics recently bought 15
per cent of the shares of Esaote, a partly US-owned Italian
pharmaceutical company, for #18 billion. Its 1995 sales should reach
L1,600 billion, up from L1,142 billion the year before. Net profits for
1995 are anticipated to be 40 per cent of sales of which 71 per cent
are derived from overseas business.

RHONE-POULENC ISSUES PROFITS WARNING

Hit by a number of negative factors, Rhone-Poulenc SA last week warned
of lower 1995 profits than forecast earlier. In 1994 the group reported
a net attributable profit of FFr1.915 billion and had hoped to post a
double-digit growth in 1995.

Investment sentiment among sector analysts appears neutral to mildly
positive: some analysts expect a flat to negative outturn, others a
healthy increase. Analysts expect the company to report net profit for
1995 of between FFr2 billion to FFr2.3 billion.

"The implication of RP's warning is that it made little or no profit in
the fourth quarter," commented one bearish analyst. Negative factors
are thought to have wiped out some FFr600 million of potential profits
in the fourth quarter - these included the slowdown in the French
economy, the transport strike and provisions for the integration and
restructuring of Fisons, expected to exceed FFr100 million.

Rhone-Poulenc Rorer separately announced that its 1995 results, due to
be released on 29 January, would be in line with the consensus of
analysts' expectations, despite a one-off tax charge of around $20-25
million. One analyst said he expected earnings per share of around
$3.25, up almost 30 per cent on 1994's $2.50 per share." We are holders
of most French drug company stocks until we see what the impact is of
the negotiations with the French government over a FFr2.5 billion
contribution sought from the industry to help cut the social security
deficit."

Still, French pharmaceutical companies will be cushioned to a greater
extent than foreign companies because of their higher domestic research
expenditure. Although French drug companies account for a quarter of
the total French pharmaceutical market, they are liable to just 15 per
cent of the total potential tax burden.

A spokesman for RPR told PBN "we are confident that the business
overall is going forward well." Details will shortly be unveiled on the
integration charge for Fisons and the structure and shape of its newly-
enlarged asthma management business.

SB INTEGRATES HEALTHCARE SERVICES

SmithKline Beecham last week announced what it termed a major
initiative to implement an integrated healthcare strategy, creating a
new unit combining the company's varied healthcare services into a
single division called Healthcare Services.

The new director Dr Tadataka Yamada, brings together the clinical
laboratories division, Diversified Pharmaceutical Services -the
pharmaceutical benefit management company acquired last year for $2.3
billion - Diversified Prescription Delivery, a mail order business, and
the recently formed Disease Management group.

Said Jan Leschly, chief executive of SB: "Alternative solutions, that
can deliver healthcare at lower costs without reducing quality, are
being aggressively pursued on a global basis. By bringing together
these groups we can better meet our current customer requirements and
at the same time build a stronger foundation for our expanding global
efforts in these areas."

LEGALITY OF CSM'S ADVICE OVER PILL CHALLENGED

The Director of the University of Aberdeen's Medicines Assessment
Research Unit is continuing to highlight the possibility that the UK
Committee on Safety of Medicines acted unlawfully in issuing advice to
doctors concerning third generation oral contraceptive Pills and the
risk of thromboembolism.

Dr Andrew Watt has written to the chief executive of the Medicines
Control Agency (MCA), Dr Keith Jones, after failing to receive a
response from the licensing authority to a letter he published in the
British Medical Journal on 16 December. The BMJ letter pointed out that
the committee had based its recommendation on hastily considered and
incomplete data. It further suggested the CSM had exceeded its
authority in advising prescribers because its remit is solely to advise
the MCA which as licensing authority should then take appropriate
action in revoking or amending product licences as seen fit. No such
action was taken so, according to Dr Watt, the MCA must be assumed to
have considered the third generation Pill to be safe and the CSM could
arguably be said to be acting unlawfully in overriding the Agency's
judgment by going direct to prescribers with advice.

In his letter to Dr Jones, Dr Watt accuses the Licensing Authority and
the Committee on Safety of Medicines of unnecessarily disrupting the
lives of one and a half million women and of actions "which do not
appear fully to have met the highest standards of behaviour either in
respect of law or science".

A statement issued to the press last weekend calls on the MCA to
demonstrate its confidence in the CSM by taking appropriate licensing
action or by stating publicly its lack of confidence in the advice.

Dr Watt whose University is conducting research work on unconnected
product areas for Wyeth ( manufacturers of the gestodene-containing
oral contraceptives Minulet and Triminulet) says his interest in the
issue stems from a previous position studying the role of the CSM. He
has however disclosed that he has worked briefly as a consultant for
one of the Pill manufacturers concerned.

If Watt's point is shown to carry weight it could conceivably benefit
oral contraceptive manufacturers if they were to take legal action
against the UK Regulator. The three month time limit for seeking a
judicial review however runs out on 18 January. As PBN went to press,
none of the three companies Schering, Wyeth and Organon had taken a
final decision on whether or not to seek a review.

GERMAN WHOLESALERS EXPAND BUSINESS

German pharmaceuticals wholesaler Anzag expects business to improve
considerably in 1996 and results to be as good as those achieved before
the introduction of the healthcare system's reform in 1993. "We
envisage between 3 per cent and 4 per cent growth in turnover," said Mr
Peter Haac, chairman of the Anzag board.

In the business year 1994/1995 (September to August), the company
recorded turnover of DM4.06 billion. From January to August 1994, when
Anzag changed its report period, it had achieved turnover of DM2.5
billion. After-tax profits were DM32.3 million, while in the first
eight months of 1994, they totalled DM22.2 million. The company
benefited considerably from the unexpected upswing in the German
pharmaceuticals wholesale market. Between September 1994 and August
1995, the combined market volume of all pharmaceuticals wholesalers
rose 7.2 per cent to DM27.3 billion. In western Germany, the increase
was 6.9 per cent totalling DM22.2 billion, and thus less pronounced
than in eastern Germany, where 8.2 per cent growth to DM5.1 billion was
recorded. Anzag maintained its market share of 16.1 per cent.

Mr Haac said the company will continue to develop its marketing
services to pharmacies, mainly in the self-medication sector. Anzag
plans to expand into new markets, particularly in eastern Europe.

Anzag's competitor Phoenix has taken another step to strengthen its
position within Europe. The company signed a letter of intent to
acquire a 52 per cent stake in Italian Comifar. The Mailand-based
wholesaler achieved turnover of around DM500 million in 1995 and holds
a market share of 20 per cent. According to Phoenix, Comifar is one of
the major pharmaceuticals wholesalers in northern Italy.

Phoenix is already present in Italy through stakes it holds in
Commercio Ingrosso Medicinali (CIM). Perugia, Societa Adriatica
Medicinali (SAM) in Paese and P Felletti Spadazzi, Padua. Including
Comifar, the Italian companies of the Phoenix group would achieve a
combined annual turnover of DM1 billion. Phoenix is also active in
France, Poland, the Netherlands, Austria, Hungary and the Czech
Republic and, again with Comifar, forecast a combined foreign turnover
of DM4 billion for 1996.

The group holds a 30 per cent share of the German pharmaceuticals
wholesale market and achieved domestic turnover of DM7 billion in 1995.

GERMAN PHARMA GROWTH LAGS IN 1995

Following a strong first half of the year, growth in the German
pharmaceuticals market slipped "perceptibly" in the second half of
1995, according to the industry association Bundesverband der
pharmazeutischen Industrie (BPI).

Against the background for statistical aberrations due to the German
government's switch to EU-compatible reporting methods, BPI said it
expects full-year figures to show production up 4 per cent and sales to
pharmacies up by just over 6 per cent. This would bring results back
into line with 1992 and 1994. The improvement is attributed in major
part to higher growth rates in eastern Germany and steady demand from
abroad in the first half year. Business in western Germany continued to
decline throughout 1995, resulting in negative production growth for
the full year.

Along with restrictions on prescribing mandated by the German health
ministry, the strength of the Deutschemark also affected adversely the
performance of German pharmaceutical producers in 1995, said BPI.

Led by anti-infectives (up 15.5 per cent) in the wake of an influenza
spell and the launch of new products in the first year, sales of
pharmaceuticals to German chemist shops rose by nearly 7 per cent from
January to November to reach a value of DM21.6 billion. Blood products
saw growth of 13 per cent, urogenital and CNS preparations 8.5 per cent
and 8.6 per cent respectively, respiratory drugs 8.1 per cent
cardiovascular medications 3.3 per cent, digestion aids 4 per cent and
muscular-skeletal drugs 2.1 per cent.

After increasing 8 per cent in 1993 and 12.6 per cent in 1994, export
sales rose by only 6 per cent in the first eight months of 1995, the
last period for which the organisation has figures. However, imports
growth also slackened to 9 per cent in the January-August time frame,
after expanding by one third in 1994. BPI estimates that producer
selling prices eased forward 0.2 per cent in 1995 following the end of
the price freeze agreed with the health ministry. In 1993, prices
declined 3.6 per cent and in 1994 by 1.2 per cent.

According to the federal office of statistics, employment in the German
pharmaceutical industry fell by 1,600 in the first nine months of 1995.

However, BPI believes the decline for the full year could be greater,
due to ongoing restructurisation procedures at drug producers since
1993.

FRENCH PHARMA INDUSTRY IS RESIGNED TO PARALLEL IMPORT THREAT

The European Commission's decision to go ahead allowing wholesalers
within the union to import pharmaceuticals from Spain and Portugal has
raised some fears of the French industry being undercut. Last autumn,
the Paris authorities sought to extend the period of protection for
another two years, but failed. There is a chance that France, and the
other nine countries opposed to this particular liberalisation will go
to the European Court of Justice. But a senior French official poured
cold water on this idea, saying that the decision was more a political
than legal matter.

The ban on Spanish and Portuguese drugs went back 10 years, to the time
when these countries joined the European Economic Community (as it was
in 1985) but did not have proper patent legislation, allowing local
pharmaceutical manufacturers to copy molecules without having
contributed to the research costs. They became subject to legislation
in 1992, and the commission set a three-year transition period, which
expired on 31 December 1995.

The French industry sought to console itself with the thought that most
Iberian production was now licensed, and that in general it was only
about 15 per cent cheaper than French production, which did not
normally justify the trouble of importing. Only a few specific drugs,
which were significantly cheaper than 15 per cent, were likely to be
affected, indicated one specialist. The impact of the change was likely
to be much greater in other countries such as Germany or Holland - the
latter having pharmaceutical prices on average some 75 per cent higher
than Spain.

Another expert noted that pharmaceuticals were relatively cheap in
France, compared with other European countries, and that France tended
to export them towards its northern neighbours. But the new rules could
undermine these sales.

The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations has
estimated that opening the Spanish border could cost its members some
$2 billion a year in lost turnover.

INSTITUT PASTEUR FIGHTS AGAINST BANKRUPTCY

The Institut Pasteur de Lyon has succeeded in raising FFr10 million
($2.02 million) additional finance to keep going - a matter of days
before it was due to go into formal liquidation. Of the additional
money, FFr8 million ($1.62 million) will come from the state, while
FFr2 million ($404,000) will come from the national research institutes
CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) and INSERM
(Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale).

But the money is not quite the end of the Institut Pasteur's
difficulties. It still needs a further FFr4 million to keep its 107-
strong research team running for a full year - long enough to put its
rescue plans into action. Pasteur Lyon's president, Christian Dutreuil,
was confident the money could be found "from a few additional sources".

The rescue plan involves transferring the 140-strong hospital biology
section to Hospices Civils de Lyon. The 125-strong commercial section,
which carries out analyses, is going into partnership with Foundation
Merieux. And to raise the funds to pay for some 82 redundancies, as
well as paying off an accumulated debt of FFr20 million ($4.04
million), the institute has arranged a property deal with the regional
blood transfusion centre, which would buy part or all of Pasteur Lyon's
building in the centre of the city, and rent it to the institute.

Institut Pasteur has lost its lawsuit alleging three patent
infringements by Cambridge Biotech concerning Cambridge's HIV-1 western
blot confirmation test.

The US bankruptcy court for Massachusetts has declared a non-exclusive
patent license to be in effect between the two companies as of 1
January covering the HIV-1 test. In September the court ruled Cambridge
has a valid licence under two of the Pasteur patents covering HIV-2.

FRENCH COMPANIES AWAIT PAYMENT FORMULA FOR LEVY

The formula for paying the special contribution of FFr2.5 billion that
the French pharmaceutical industry is having to make this year towards
reducing the national health insurance deficit will be officially
announced by the government on 17 January, when a Cabinet meeting is
due to approve the final text of the executive order. The formula is
being negotiated between the Syndicat National de l'Industrie
Pharmaceutique (SNIP), the industry federation, and Health Ministry
officials; neither side is prepared to make any official comment about
the content of their discussions at present.

However, some pointers to the way each company's contribution will be
calculated have leaked out and given rise to what SNIP calls "press
speculation". The talks appear to be moving towards the adoption of a
formula composed of three components. Almost half the surcharge, FFr1.2
billion, would be raised through a tax on any increase in companies
revenues in 1995. However, those companies whose revenues rose by less
than 3 per cent (or less than 4.5 per cent in the case of those that
have signed conventions with the government on the limitation of their
drug sales) would be exempt. Others would be liable to pay the
equivalent of 25-30 per cent of the growth in turnover between 3-6 per
cent and 50-60 per cent on any increase over 6 per cent.

In addition, there could be an exceptional increase in the special tax
on pharmaceutical companies' advertising and marketing outlays from 9
per cent to 14 per cent this year, which would generate an additional
FFr500 million.

Finally, some FFr700-800 million would be raised through a 1.5 per cent
surtax on companies' total revenues, less R&D outlays.

Whatever the amounts due by companies under these different headings,
no company will have to pay in total more than the equivalent of 6.5
per cent of its 1995 turnover. The government order is expected to
require all companies to file an assessment of what they owe by 1
April, with payment to be made by 31 August.

The government is introducing all its planned social security reforms
by means of executive orders, which circumvent normal legislative
procedures. Five are to be promulgated over the next few months and
must be ratified en bloc by parliament by 31 May at the latest. They
will provide successively for: the introduction of a new contribution
to pay off the accumulated debts of the social security system over the
medium to long term; the implementation of short-term measures for
bringing social security income and expenditure into balance in 1996-97
(which includes the pharmaceutical industry's contribution); reform of
the health insurance system and its administration; hospital reform;
and new measures for controlling healthcare costs by establishing
guidelines for good medical practice.

ITALIAN PHARMA INDUSTRY COMES UNDER RENEWED PRESSURE

A further drastic reduction in state reimbursement for medicines this
year has been approved in a government Finance Bill amendment by the
Italian parliament. The sudden and surprising move, hotly contested by
the pharmaceutical industry, is likely to force major changes in the
classification of reimbursable medicines and, according to the
industry, will accelerate its decline.

The legislative action follows a government decree to write off cost
overruns in government reimbursement for medicines for 1995. The L9,000
billion ceiling forecast for 1995 was exceeded by L700 billion.

Parliament has called for a similar spending cap during the government
1996 Finance Bill debate and to ensure a chance of succeeding has
attached an amendment stating that reimbursements will be based, as of
April, on the cost of the cheapest medicines in the same class
administered by the same route. Until now, reimbursements were allowed
regardless of cost.

The legislative move has created confusion, if not panic, within the
industry because, in effect, it means medicines costing more than the
cheapest ones in their class may no longer be marketable.

In addition, the amendment also calls for physicians to inform patients
prescribed a more expensive alternative that government will reimburse
only the cost of the cheapest drug of its type available for their
medical condition. In effect it would mean that most prescriptions will
be for the cheapest medicines since it seems unlikely patients would
want to pay the difference for medicines considered of equal efficacy.
Most will opt to change brands.

Italy's pharmaceutical industry association, Farmindustria has
responded with a sharp, so far futile, protest, threatening to withdraw
altogether from the National Health service and the reimbursement
scheme.

Farmindustria has claimed that medicine prices in Italy, are now 31 per
cent below that of the European Union average, with prices forced to
drop by 20 per cent in the past four years despite 18 per cent
inflation in the same period. In addition, according to Farmindustria,
in the past 12 months medicine prices dropped by 7 per cent, while
inflation remained at 6 per cent and production costs soared (25 per
cent for glass, 39 per cent for packaging, 6.5 per cent for rubber and
4.7 per cent for labour).

"Under these conditions, "Farmindustria declared, "companies can no
longer guarantee necessary standards, and many are being forced to halt
investment in Italy."

Although 1995 figures are not yet available, Italy's pharmaceutical
industry stood alone among all industrialised nations in showing a
decline in both production and revenues during 1994. Much of this is
attributed to diminishing government subsidies, which declined from a
peak of L14,000 billion four years ago to the ceiling of L9,000 billion
in 1995. The ceiling is expected to remain the same in 1996.

At the same time, Parliament is also calling for the possible
introduction of generic medicines in an attempt to further reduce
government spending on medicines and for a 50 per cent discount on
certain drugs for specific diseases.

As supposed compensation for reduced government spending on medicines,
the prices of some Class A and Class B medicines are to increase
between 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent in 1996. But Farmindustria said
there would be no real increase since prices would merely return to
their 1994 levels.

Industry sources are consoling themselves with the hope that the
parliamentary amendment may be subject to further debate in a future
parliament. The life of this legislature, although elected less than
two years ago, is on a tight-rope and early elections are likely
sometime in 1996.

EC MAY DROP ANTIBIOTIC CONTROLS

The European commission is considering easing import controls on the
first generation antibiotic, dihydrostreptomycin, from China. Under a
1991 Council Regulation, imports are currently subject to a strict anti-
dumping duty to protect European industry. But a review of this
limitation has been requested by Dutch importer, Tocelo Chemicals,
acting on its own behalf and also for Long March Pharmaceutical Plant,
a Chinese exporter. They claim the duty is no longer necessary to
offset dumping, because there is no Community industry that would be
injured by such imports. The original - and sole - EU complainant in
the proceedings that led to duty being imposed was Rhone Poulenc
Biochimie, which, says Tocelo, has now ceased production. It also says
the other EU manufacturer, Norbrook Laboratories Ltd produces a
different type of dihydro-streptomycin, for internal consumption only.

The Commission has therefore opened an investigation, and will seek
information via questionnaire from Rhone Poulenc, Norbrook, and
importers known to be concerned. At the same time, a copy of the
questionnaires will be sent to representative associations of
importers. The Commission is inviting any other parties interested in
co-operating in the investigation to make contact with it directly, and
to submit views by mid-February. But it stresses that any information
submitted under this article will only be taken into account if
supported by factual evidence at the time of submission. Details from:

EU HELPS FIGHT DIPHTHERIA

The European Commission has granted nearly ECU2 million ($2.4 million)
to combat diphtheria in the new independent states of the former Soviet
Union. The grant will be channelled via the European Community
Humanitarian Office and will enable the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) to
continue work on a co-ordinated vaccination campaign.

UNICEF will get a grant of ECU1 million, to cover Tadjikistan, the
country with the highest level of fatal cases (ECU630,000 ), and the
three southern Caucasus states, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia
(ECU370,000). IFRC will get a grant of ECU980,000, for work in Belarus
(ECU730,000), and the Russian Federation (ECU250,000).

Diphtheria, which had been virtually eradicated in Western Europe, made
a comeback in the former Soviet Union as social structures broke down.
In 1994, there were about 50,000 cases, eight out of 10 of them in the
Russian Federation. Isolated cases have also been reported in the
European Union in individuals who had travelled east.

These new grants provide continuing support for the anti-diphtheria
campaign the World Health Organisation launched in late 1994 with
UNICEF and IFRC. ECHO's contribution prior to this fresh funding
amounts to 3.6 MECU. Thanks to the campaign, the number of cases
reported in the Russian Federation has been declining since July, but
elsewhere both the number of cases and death rates are still climbing.

FDA ISSUES GUIDELINE ON NEW DRUG SUBSTANCE IMPURITIES

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published, 4 January, a
guideline entitled Impurities in New Drug Substances following the
International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), in the EU, Japan
and the US. The final draft was approved at the ICH meeting in March
l995.

The guideline assists drug marketing registration by detailing the
content and qualifications of impurities in new drug substances
produced by chemical syntheses and not previously registered in a
region or member state. It is not intended to apply to new drug
substances used during the clinical research stage of development or
clinical trials. Not covered are: biological/biotechnological, peptide,
oligonucleotide, radiopharmaceutical, fermentation and semisynthetic
products, herbal and crude products of animal origin. The guidance
addresses impurities in new drug substances from two perspectives;

GLAXO WELLCOME TO BUILD NEW PLANT IN RIO DE JANEIRO

Glaxo Wellcome has announced it will build a new $111.3 million plant
in the state of Rio de Janeiro. It will be Glaxo Wellcome's second in
Brazil and represents a stepping stone towards GW doubling its market
share from 2 per cent to 4 per cent in the year 2000, said Jorge
Raimundo Filho, president of GW's Brazilian operations.

GW Brazil had a turnover of around $100 million in 1995 and expects
this to grow to $300 million in the year 2000.

Bristol Myers Squibb currently leads pharmaceuticals sales in Brazil
with a 6 per cent market share.

BRAZILIAN DRUG SALES UP28 PER CENT

Figures released in December by Brazil's association of pharmaceuticals
manufacturers (Abifarma - Associacao Brasileira da Industria
Farmaceutica), show 1995 sales rose 28.2 per cent to R$8.23 billion
Brazilian Reals (c US$8.35 billion). Brazil is the world's fourth
largest pharmaceuticals market after the US, France and Italy.

Only 50 per cent of Brazil's medicines production was exported in 1995
but Abifarma plans to raise this amount to between 10 per cent and 15
per cent with target markets being the South American Common Market
(Marcosur) and other Latin American countries.

During the year 1.77 billion units were sold, 16.4 per cent more than
in 1994. Abifarma's president Sr Jose Eduardo Bandeira de Mello said at
least five pharmaceutical companies were closing their plants in other
countries and planning to move their operations to Brazil.

In 1995, he said, laboratories invested $250 million in Brazil, up 25
per cent on the previous year. In 1996 he expected these investments to
increase substantially seeing Glaxo Wellcome alone was investing $111
million.

ELI LILLY INVESTS $20 MILLION IN BRAZIL

At the end of December Eli Lilly & Co announced $20 million investments
in its Brazilian subsidiary. The funding will be used to build a new
production unit alongside its existing installations in Cosmopolis, Sao
Paulo. The new plant will produce principally antibiotics.

Eli Lilly plans to double its exports from Brazil to $30 million in the
next three years. Its export markets are Mercosur (the South American
common market consisting of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay),
Asia and the US.

This is the largest investment made by the company in Brazil where it
has been established for 51 years. Most of the $20 million will be used
to buy high technology equipment in order to bring production
techniques into line with FDA requirements.

The Brazilian subsidiary of Eli Lilly had a turnover of approximately
$180 million in 1995.

Investments reported to be planned by other companies include Knoll
Basf ($37 million); Sanofi Winthrop ($7.3 million); Fundacao Ataulfo de
Paiva ($5 million); Laboratorio Darrow ($3 million ) and Bravet ($2
million).

BRAZILIAN MEDICINE PRICES INCREASE

Brazilian medicine prices were allowed to rise in December by an
average of 8 per cent. The industry had been demanding 14 per cent.
Medicine prices should not be adjusted again until June 1996.

The 8 per cent limit was calculated by Brazil's prices secretary to be
the industry's loss through inflation. Since Brazil's successful anti-
inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 medicine prices have risen
21.34 per cent. The plan has cut inflation from 50 per cent a month to
less than 2 per cent.

In order to co-operate with the government's anti-inflation plan,
laboratories have agreed to place 100 to 150 generic medicines on the
market and to cut prices to the less well-off through public hospitals
and health scheme discounts.

The industry has also backed OTC sales in supermarkets in order to
reduce prices. Brazil's pharmacies operate with a profit margin of 42.5
per cent and it is hoped to cut this to around 30 per cent.

SANOFI GAINS US RIGHTS TO PHOTOFRIN

Sanofi Winthrop Inc, the US subsidiary of Sanofi, itself part of the
Elf Aquitaine group, has signed an agreement with Canadian company QLT
PhotoTherapeutics Inc giving Sanofi Winthrop exclusive US marketing
rights to Photofrin (porfimer sodium) and future photodynamic therapy
products developed by QLT (originally known as Quadra Logic
Technologies). Photofrin, used to treat advanced oesophageal cancer is
the first light-activated drug for use in photodynamic therapy to be
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

The agreement provides for Sanofi to pay an access fee, partly in cash
and partly through the purchase of QLT stock, as well as to make
milestone payments for the development of new photodynamic therapy
products (although no timetable has been set).

Photodynamic therapy is an emerging medical technology utilising drugs
activated by light, for the treatment of various cancers, as well as
use in ophthalmology and other diseases.

Photofrin is administered intravenously and accumulates in tumours; it
is then activated by non-thermal light emitted by a medical laser,
producing an active form of oxygen that helps destroy cancer cells.

Sanofi describes the deal as a logical step in its developing oncology
programme. It has a number of anti-cancer compounds undergoing clinical
development, which include:

* tirapazamine, for the treatment of solid tumours, currently in Phase
III clinical trials in the US;

* mitoguazone, for Aids-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma;

* oxaliplatin, for colorectal and ovarian cancers, which is being
tested in Europe; and

* urate oxidase, for hyperuricaemia-associated cancer treatment.

JAPANESE FIRMS' INTERIM RESULTS

Interim earnings of Japan's top drug makers fell in line with
expectations, with few surprises overall.

More importantly, year to March forecasts - the focus of most attention
- were subdued, as the companies seek to avoid closer scrutiny from the
Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) which will implement a new round
of ethical drug price cuts from 1 April.

Industry leader Takeda, recorded a doubling of revenues of its lead
product Lupron, to Y10.5 billion in the half year, and is forecasting
revenues in the full year here of Y21.5 billion (US215 million).

For Sankyo, revenues of its cholesterol agent, Mervalotin, rose 5-8 per
cent to Y67.4 billion, and are forecast to reach Y131.4 billion ($1.31
billion) in the year to March. Continued growth in revenues leaves the
product exposed to further price cuts from the MHW which takes especial
interest in drugs generating revenues of over Y100 billion as being
over-priced.

In the same drug category, Merck associate Banyu Pharmaceutical saw
revenues of its cholesterol agent Lipovase rise 24 per cent in the
September half, reaching Y16 billion ($160 million), and set to total
Y31.5 billion in the year to March.

It also saw buoyant growth from its EPO, ESPO, with revenues rising by
7.1 per cent to Y15.1 billion in the years first half, which is
forecast at Y30.2 billion for the full term.

Ono Pharmaceutical's September half year spending on R&D rose to Y7.83
billion, up from Y7.12 billion in the same term last year. Year to
March outlays are budgeted at Y12.47 billion. Similarly, Dai Nippon
Pharmaceutical, is forecasting year to March R&D outlays of Y13
billion.

Industry leader Takeda's R&D spending is to rise to Y61 billion in the
full year, following a rise in September half earnings to Y30.4
billion.

Sankyo continues to top the list in terms of R&D outlays, with year to
March spending budgeted at Y45.1 billion, well ahead of Takeda's and
pitched at over 10 per cent of forecast full year revenues of Y405
billion

Japan's year to March 1995, drug sector revenues were basically flat,
rising 1 per cent year on year to Y5.75 billion, on a drug production
basis.

Revenues in most key categories showed modest rises, with the biggest
declines in areas such as antibiotics, down 12.9 per cent and
traditional Chinese medicines, down 14.3 per cent.

Both of these areas have been recent targets of the MWH for cuts,
following sizeable rises in recent years.

INDIA FINALISES DRUG PRICING BODY

A National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority is on schedule to be up and
running in India for the new financial year beginning 1 April 1996.
Posts of chairman and secretary and the NPPA's remit have now been
sanctioned by the union cabinet following year long talks with the
ministries of chemicals, industry and finance.

The NPPA will be an independent body with more flexibility in drug
pricing than the Bureau of Costs and Prices was allowed. Besides fixing
drug prices, the authority will update the list of drugs subject to
price control each year, monitor prices of other drugs, and will
oversee the implementation of the Drug Price Control Order. Time limits
for deciding on price approvals will be set by the NPPA. Initially
these will be two months for formulations and four months for bulk
drugs.

SPIC TO EXPAND ANTIBIOTIC PRODUCTION

SPIC Pharma the pharmaceutical division of Madras-based Southern
Petrochemicals Industries Corp Ltd (SPIC), plans to invest Rs3,000
million in its core areas of fermentation products, synthetic drugs and
herbal products over the next two to three years, says pharmaceuticals
vice-president Dr MD Nair. Cephalosporins will be the next
antibacterials to be manufactured.

SPIC, which commissioned an international-sized plant for Penicillin G
in June last year at Cuddalore with an initial investment of Rs1,800
million and bought in overseas technology, is also experimenting with
other antibacterials. The company is planning to manufacture Penicillin
based products such as ampicillin and amoxycillin and is seeking
marketing partners globally and on the domestic front for these, said
Dr Nair. The company is already working with a number of German
pharmaceutical companies and with companies in the Indo-China region,
eg, in Vietnam and Cambodia.

LUPIN DEVELOPS OWN HIV TESTS

Bombay company Lupin Laboratories has announced it is developing
diagnostic kits for HIV I and II that are specific to particular
antigens predominant in Aids patients in India.

The company is investing 6.4 per cent of its Rs4450 million turnover on
R&D compared with an average of 1.5 to 2 per cent for most Indian
pharmaceutical companies.

Lupin, which already manufactures five cephalosporins, is also setting
up facilities at Mandideep, near Bhopal to produce ceftazidime. The
company launched cefachlor, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime last year and
expects a sales potential of Rs2000 million annually from its
cephalosporin range.

PHARMAC REVIEWS MEDICINES SUBSIDY POLICY

New Zealand pharmaceutical funding agency, Pharmac, is looking at
redirecting resources into more cost-effective treatments such as the
AZT/DDI or AZT/DDC Aids cocktails and away from treatments "which it
subsidises for purely historical reasons and which probably no longer
warrant being given out free." Pharmac is spending NZ$2.3 million
(US$1.5 million) subsidising cold sore creams "and at the same time,"
David Moore, Pharmac general manager says, "we don't have the half
million necessary to extend the lives of Aids victims."

Mr Moore is at odds with the New Zealand Medical Association over a
statement that doctors have been prescribing medicines like a "lolly
scramble". But Mr Moore says "whether Dr Dennis Pezaro," president of
the New Zealand Medical Association, "wants to acknowledge it or  not,
there is considerable wastage in some parts of the medicines budget."

Mr Moore says the extent to which medicines are wasted is demonstrated
by a recent campaign to collect unused drugs which touched only four
per cent of Auckland homes, but collected unused drugs worth $730,000
including Roaccutane for acne, bronchodilators, treatments for
rheumatic disease and gout, and antibacterials.

Pezaro told PBN  "it's a ridiculous storm in a teacup." The NZMA has no
problem with controlling wastage. "The question is how we go about
strategies to contain it and Mr Moore appears to have a problem
recognising who are his helpers." Pezaro says the NZMA and Pharmac
should be "sitting down and talking things through" but Pharmac "is not
in a consultative mode." Pharmac is a joint venture of New Zealand's
four regional health authorities.

In Pezaro's view some wastage is "truly inevitable". In the end, it is
"patient choice" whether they finish a course of medicines or not.
"Where it is very much controllable," in his view, however, "is where
prolonged quantities are dispensed in order to cut the co-payment
implications for the patient."

Three-month prescribing was very low before the New Zealand government
introduced part-charges, Pezaro says. "Part of the wastage is a direct
responsibility of government policy." Pezaro is not necessarily
suggesting part-charges should be abolished, but that they should be
structured so that they do not introduce incentives to over-
prescribing. There is currently no difference in the co-payment amount
per item whether the prescription is for a short or long treatment.

PROCEPT FORMS VACTEX TO DEVELOP TB VACCINE

Procept, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company, has joined with
top researchers at the Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's
Hospital, and a group of investors to form the VacTex Corp. The latter
has raised $1 million to fund new vaccine developments which exploit
the discoveries of researchers Dr Michael Brenner and Dr Steven
Porcelli regarding hitherto unknown aspects of immunology concerning
the CD-1 system of lipid antigen presentation.

Vaccines based on lipid antigens may succeed where other approaches
using MHC molecules have failed, according to a company statement.
Infectious agents which may be addressed by novel vaccines include
tuberculosis, malaria and salmonella, said VacTex chairman and CEO Dr
Robert Carpenter. Initial efforts will focus on producing a vaccine for
TB which affects 1.8 billion people worldwide and is the leading cause
of death from a single infectious agent. Procept has an option to
purchase VacTex under certain unspecified terms and conditions.

Procept has also announced it is to start a new Phase I/II trial of its
anti-HIV drug PR 2000 in Belgium under the direction of Dr Nathan
Clumeck at the Saint Pierre University Hospital, Brussels. A Phase I
safety trial using single bolus injections was successfully completed
in the UK last May but continuous iv infusion has been associated with
reversible liver enzyme and platelet changes in some patients.  The new
trial will therefore stick to single daily bolus injections.

PR 2000 blocks the binding of a surface glycoprotein gp 120 found on
the HIV-I virus to the CD4 protein on immune cells. The rationale for
its use is therefore to act as a molecular barrier to block HIV from
infecting critical immune system cells including T-cells and
macrophages. By targeting the CD4 protein rather than the HIV virus
itself, Procept believes drug resistance is less likely.

ALLIANCE AND HMR COLLABORATE ON LIQUIVENT

The San Diego based Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp and Hoechst Marion
Roussel have announced an agreement in principle for a worldwide
licence to develop and market LiquiVent (perflubron) for treatment of
acute respiratory failure. A final agreement, conditional on regulatory
approvals, is expected to be negotiated within the next two months.

Alliance has recently started a paediatric Phase II/III trial of
LiquiVent for acute respiratory failure in addition to continuing
trials with adults and premature babies. Early trials in adults,
children and premature babies showed the treatment improves respiratory
gas exchange and lung mechanics.

HMR wants LiquiVent in order to build up its respiratory drug portfolio
which includes the anti-allergic drug Seldane, Rifampicin for TB,
several development compounds for asthma, allergies and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as well as antibiotics used to
treat lower respiratory tract infections.

Hoechst says the licence agreement is expected to include the purchase
of a minority equity interest in Alliance and a licence fee payment for
Alliance contingent on milestone developments. HMR will fund product
development and pay Alliance royalties on sales. In return HMR will
have exclusive manufacturing and worldwide marketing rights to the
product.

AGOURON TO START NEW ANTICANCER DRUG TRIALS

Clinical testing of Agouron Pharmaceuticals' two new anticancer drugs
will start this year, company president and CEO Peter Johnson has
announced.

Speaking at the Hambrecht & Quist Annual Life Science Conference in San
Francisco, he said one agent, AG2034, has demonstrated potent anti-
tumour activity in preclinical animal models. The drug inhibits an
enzyme required for the synthesis of purine nucleotides essential for
sustained proliferation of cancer cells.

Another agent, AG3340, has shown significant anti-metastatic and anti-
tumour activity in animal models. The drug, which is orally
bioavailable and has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile, was designed
as a potential selective inhibitor of matrix metalloprotease enzymes
involved in cancer and arthritis.

The company already has the anti-cancer agent Thymitaq (AG 337) in
clinical development. To date 120 patients have been enrolled in six
Phase II studies (PBN 258 1995, Vol II, Page 19).

Viracept (nelfinavir mesylate), the company's anti HIV drug being
developed in conjunction with the pharmaceutical division of Japan
Tobacco, is also in Phase II trials. In the trial programme, evaluating
eight different dose levels, it has shown potent activity in acute HIV
infection, said Mr Johnson. In the most recent studies, doses of 750mg
and 1000mg tds produced significantly greater reductions of HIV than
lower doses tested previously. Large scale pivotal trials using the
higher doses are now scheduled to begin next month.

BIOCRYST STARTS PHASE II TRIAL FOR T-CELL CANCER AGENT

BioCryst Pharmaceuticals' oral formulation of its lead drug BCX-34, a
small molecule inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase - the
enzyme active in T-cell proliferation, is now in a Phase I/II dose
escalation trial. The trial follows an open label Phase I trial which
showed it is well tolerated in doses of 36-42mg iv followed by the same
dose orally a week later and has high bioavailability (>76 per cent).

The new trial will target BCX-34 against T-cell cancers for which
currently there are no satisfactory effective treatments, said
president and CEO Dr Charles Bugg. But the drug is also to be tested
for other clinical conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple
sclerosis and transplant rejection. BCX-34 was granted orphan status in
1993 and qualifies for accelerated review as a new drug to treat
serious and life-threatening illness.

In the Phase I/II trial, to be conducted at University of Alabama,
Birmingham, a dose range of 20mg up to 350mg twice daily for 28 days
will be tested.

More than 20,000 patients in the US are thought to suffer from T-cell
cancers - either cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, T-cell leukaemia or other T
cell cancers. Approximately, 1,000 new cases of CTCL, more than 400 new
cases of T-CLL and approximately 8,000 new cases of other T-cell
cancers are diagnosed each year in the US.

A topical formulation of BCX-34 tested in a Phase I open-label trial
showed evidence of efficacy in CTCL and as a result a multicentre Phase
III trial of topical treatment in CTCL is now in progress. A Phase II
trial is examining topical therapy in psoriasis.

THERATECHNOLOGIES' LEUKAEMIA RESEARCH GRANT

The National Research Council of Canada has awarded Theratechnologies a
$350,000 grant to continue its research into the photodynamic treatment
of leukaemia. The money will enable the research to progress to Phase I
trials.

Preliminary research over the past four years suggests
Theratechnologies has produced a molecule that will benefit patients
with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The molecule may also be of benefit in
other types of leukaemia and some metastic cancers, says the company.
Theratech researchers have also developed a new activating light
source.

The new technique permits autologous bone marrow grafting; previously
only a quarter of chronic myeloid leukaemia patients receive a bone
marrow graft depending on the compatibility of available donor marrow.

the bronchodilator, and to avoid side effects of hyper-reactivity. A
Phase II trial completed last year demonstrated that the S-isomer of
racemic albuterol, previously considered inert, induces bronchial
hyper reactivity. Racemic albuterol products currently generate revenues
worth around $2.5 billion worldwide.

MORE HEART PROBLEMS FOR IMIGRAN

Another sumatriptan - associated myocardial infarction is reported in
the current issue of Neurology (45: 2274-6). The patient, a 43-year old
Canadian man, suffered a transmural MI within one hour of ingesting
sumatriptan 100mg.

Dr P O'Connor of St Michael's Hospital, Toronto, said that the case
underscores the need to avoid using sumatriptan in patients with a
history of symptomatic coronary artery disease, or ill-defined chest
pain. He further suggests caution in using sumatriptan in any patient
with significant vascular risk factors, including smoking.

The occurrence of serious cardiac complications after sumatriptan
injection resulted in Glaxo Wellcome issuing a warning in October 1994
that "Serious coronary events, including some that have been fatal,
following Imitrex (Imigran) injection have occurred but are extremely
rare."

Dr O'Connor highlights a previous report of a 47 year old woman who
developed symptoms of severe substernal chest pain radiating to the
left shoulder 15 minutes after 6mg subcutaneous injection. In June
1995, Neurology also reported another cardiac arrest suffered by a 35-
year-old woman within minutes of receiving a first time dose of
subcutaneous sumatriptan.

Glaxo Wellcome's spokeswoman Corrine Gordon said "Imigran is
contraindicated in patients with ischaemic heart disease or previous MI
- but use in patients with risk factors for heart disease is a matter
of clinical judgement. We normally advise that patients in whom
recognised cardiac disease is likely should be evaluated for underlying
cardiovascular disease - examples of these sorts of patients would be
post menopausal women, males over 40 and patients with risk factors for
coronary artery disease. Its basically a matter of clinical judgement
what these risk factors are".

In the UK Glaxo Wellcome issued a "Dear Doctor" letter strengthening
existing warnings and precautions about use of Imigran in December
1994.

RANITIDINE FOR PSORIASIS

Better news for Glaxo Wellcome comes with the publication of a study
showing that ranitidine (Zantac) has a substantial clinical effect in
the treatment of psoriasis.

Previous studies of H2 receptor antagonists in psoriasis, have proved
disappointing; an almost immediate deterioration in some patients
leading to discontinuation of treatment.

The key to success, according to a team of Danish dermatologists and
immunologists, is persistence. They found that oral ranitidine 300mg
twice daily for six months reduced the mean PASI score (Psoriasis Area
and Severity Index) from 15.7 to 5.7 in 18 patients with moderate to
severe plaque-type psoriasis.

Fifteen patients did experience a mild to moderate worsening of their
psoriasis in the first month of treatment. However, this resolved with
continuing therapy. "We emphasise that initial worsening during
ranitidine therapy is not a reason for discontinuation of treatment as
clinical benefit was observed in the long term. Ranitidine appears to
be a safe and effective long-term treatment for psoriasis," reported Dr
H Nielsen of the National University Hospital, Denmark. (British
Journal of Dermatology 133:  905-908).

The accumulating evidence of benefit for ranitidine in this indication
suggests that histamine is involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
Ranitidine is thought to act by blocking H2-receptors presented by CD8+
T lymphocytes, counteracting a possible dysregulation of CD8+ cytotoxic
lymphocyte-CD8+ suppressor lymphocyte axis. This may return suppressor
activity to normal and down-regulate synthesis and presentation of
major histocompatibility class II antigen and release of
auto antibodies.

BIOADHESIVE TABLET FOR VAGINOSIS

A bioadhesive vaginal tablet containing 100mg metronidazole and applied
to the cervix shows promise for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis,
according to preliminary studies by Dr J Remon, of the Laboratory of
Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Gent, Belgium.

In tests, the bioadhesive tablet achieved similar cure rates to
conventional oral metronidazole, but using only one-seventieth of the
oral dose (Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology  47:  970-971).

Dr Remon concludes that further tests of the bioadhesive matrix
(consisting of a modified starch/polyacrylic mixture) are required. The
formula has already been used successfully as a buccal bioadhesive
tablet to treat candidiasis.

MEDICINES MONITORING UNIT TO EXPAND POST MARKETING WORK

Following six years of successful development, The Medicines Monitoring
Unit (MEMO) based at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, UK is to expand its
work, according to a report published in the current issue of the
journal Pharmaceutical Medicine (9:  177-184). The unit, which is
supported by the UK Medicines Control Agency, has developed an
automated database on record-linkage techniques to conduct post-
marketing drug safety studies, and currently has access to data for
400,000 residents of Tayside Scotland. In future, record linkage
studies will be conducted on the entire population of Scotland (5.5
million) giving the unit enhanced capacity to study newly-marketed
drugs. Other planned developments include linkage with GP-based
computer systems, and ISDN links to pharmacies (enabling the provision
of accurate drug utilisation data).

INFLUENZA VACCINE BENEFIT FOR ELDERLY CONFIRMED

Doubts about the efficacy of influenza vaccination of older individuals
will be dispelled by a study published in the current International
Journal of Epidemiology (24, 6, 1240-1247).

Dr Suzanne Ohmit, of the School of Public Health, University of
Michigan, found that vaccination reduced the likelihood of 65+ year
olds being admitted to hospital with influenza by 32 per cent during
both influenza type A and type B epidemics. Her community based
influenza surveillance programme covered seven counties in Michigan,
over a two year period.

CORTICOSTEROID CONTROVERSY HIGHLIGHTS BONE LOSS

While the controversy over the safety of inhaled corticosteroids in
young asthmatics continues, a new twist has been added to the story by
Californian researchers. Doctors from the Department of Family and
Preventive Medicine, University of California, say that older adults
may risk loss of bone mineral density following prolonged use of oral
and inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone, triamcinolone,
flunisolide).

Their study, published in the American Journal of Public Health (85, 12
pages 1693-95) suggests that women may be more at risk. The decrease in
bone mineral densities for oral corticosteroid users (compared with non-
users) was 7.2 per cent  at the midshaft radius, 9.4 per cent at the
hip and 8 per cent at the spine. "The most striking difference was at
the hip, suggesting that this site may be particularly vulnerable to
corticosteroids," reported Dr Elizabeth Barrett-Connor. She suggests
that further studies of bone mineral density loss and corticosteroid
use (particularly inhaled use) in older adults are still needed.

BENEFIT IN GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE

Oral beclomethasone dipropionate appears safe and effective in the
treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease, a complication of
allogenic bone marrow transplantation, according to a study by
University of Washington oncologists and gastroenterologists.

Forty-two patients were given 8mg BDP daily for up to 28 days. Symptoms
such as nausea and diarrhoea improved, as did appetite. An overall
beneficial response was observed in 72 per cent of the group and
further studies are warranted, concluded the report (Transplantation,
60, 11, 1231-38).

OFLOXACIN SEIZURE RISK WARNING

Clinicians have been reminded to comply strictly with manufacturers
guidelines for renally impaired patients, when using the antibiotic
ofloxacin (Tarivid, Hoechst). A report in Clinical Infectious Diseases
(21: 1504-6) describes four patients who had seizures while receiving
ofloxacin. All were older patients receiving high doses. Renal
insufficiency was thought to play a role in three cases. The authors,
from Akron City Hospital, Ohio, US, say that neurotoxicity and seizures
associated with ofloxacin have previously been described. Dosage
reductions may be warranted in elderly, severely ill patients because
accumulation may occur in some severely ill patients in spite of normal
renal function.

TAXOL INHIBITS BONE RESORPTION

The anti-tumour compound taxol has been found to inhibit osteoclastic
bone resorption, suggesting benefit in the inhibition of hypercalcaemia
and bone metastases, according to research published by Dr Tony Hall,
of Ciba-Geigy, Basle, Switzerland.

The report, which appears as a rapid communication in the current issue
of Calcified Tissue International, (57: 463-465) shows that Taxol dose-
dependently inhibited bone resorption in a bone-slice assay. This
inhibition was only partly accounted for by a decrease in osteoclast
spreading, suggesting that Taxol inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption
by more than one mechanism.

BROMOCRIPTINE FAILS IN APHASIA

The postsynaptic dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine has failed to show
any benefit in the first randomised, double-blind and placebo
controlled study of aphasia.

The study, by neurologist Dr Sergio Strakstein, of the Department of
Behavioural Neurology, Raul Carrea Institute of Neurological Research,
Buenos Aires, followed earlier reports that bromocriptine may improve
language deficit in people suffering nonfluent aphasia.

However, the study, which used doses escalating from 3.75 mg/day to
60mg day over a six week period , failed to show any differences
between active and placebo treatment when speech was rated by a speech
pathologist.

KW-4679 IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS

KW-4679 a new compound thought to have both antihistaminic and anti-
allergic properties may be useful for the treatment of allergic
rhinitis, according to pharmacologists from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co, the
Japanese company responsible for synthesising the compound.

Animal work, published in this month's Japanese Journal of Pharmacology
shows that the compound reduced nasal blockage. The mechanism of action
is thought to be via the inhibition of release of histamine, peptide
leukotrienes , the production of PAF and leukotriene B4, and the
release of neuropeptides.

GAVISCON SCORES OVER ALGITEC

Liquid Gaviscon (Reckitt and Colman) is superior to Algitec Suspension
(SmithKline Beecham) in the prevention of reflux when given as a single
dose, according to a study by Dr N Washington, of the Department of
Surgery, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK.

The study assessed the ability of both compounds to suppress food and
acid reflux into the oesophagus after a test meal in 12 healthy
volunteers. Liquid Gaviscon significantly reduced both food and acid
reflux, but Algitec did not (Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology  47:
879-882).

The raft strength of Algitec was approximately half that of Liquid
Gaviscon, a factor which may explain the poor results for the former,
said Dr Washington. Algitec is a combination of sodium alginate with
cimetidine. According to the report, the H2 -receptor antagonist and
the alginate may interact in a complex manner with the latter
influencing the delivery or bioavailability of the cimetidine. Although
a longer dosing schedule may improve the benefit from Algitec, most
patients want immediate symptomatic relief on an as-needed basis and
"the formation of a physical barrier on the gastric contents by the
alginate (in Gaviscon) allows an immediate action," concludes the
report.

The novel CCK-B antagonist CI-988 could not be distinguished from
placebo in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder, when given at
a dose of 300mg/day thrice daily, according to research published by
Parke-Davis (Michigan) researchers. In the current Journal of Clinical
Psychopharmacology (15: 6,428-433) they report that " there were no
trends in this study strong enough to warrant repeating a study using
CI-988 at the 300mg/day dose." However, evaluations of higher doses
will be performed to discover whether CCK-B antagonists play a role in
the modulation of anxiety, concluded their report.

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE WARNING

Two reports published this month highlight the growing problem of
antibiotic resistance. Finnish researchers call for more prudent use of
antibiotics in outpatients following the finding of a statistically
significant association between local erythromycin use and erythromycin
resistance in group A streptococci in Finland. "Restrictions of
treatment are essential to the continued efficacy of antibiotics
currently available," states their report (Clinical Infectious Diseases
21: 1378-85).

A second study, by German researchers, tracked national antimicrobial
resistance patterns over two years for Streptococcus pneumoniae
isolates causing systemic infections (Clinical Infectious Diseases 21:
1398-401). The prospective study involved 40 laboratories ranged across
Germany. The results showed that penicillin remained the antibiotic of
choice for pneumococcal infections (despite 1.8 per cent of isolates
showing reduced susceptibility. Rates of resistance to clindamycin,
erythromycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol were 1.4 per cent, 3.2
per cent, 11 per cent, and 1.9 per cent respectively. Resistance to
cefotaxime was not observed.

CYTOKINES AS VACCINE ADJUVANTS

In the light of limited clinical data and the controversial results
obtained, much more work has to be done before cytokines can be
accepted as adjuvants for use in human vaccines, according to a review
article by Sandoz researchers, published in this month's Clinical
Infectious Diseases (21: 1439-49).

"Two critical issues must be addressed by clinical trials of vaccines
with cytokine adjuvants.  The first is the balance between safety and
adjuvanticity...the second is how best to combine vaccines and
adjuvants," concludes the review - however despite these reservations,
it says that cytokines are likely to play an important role as future
adjuvants.

NEW FRAXIPARINE IN STROKE STUDY

A new trial to find out if low molecular weight heparin can be used to
treat stroke victims begins this week in Europe, North America, Hong
Kong, and Australia.

A product licence for the use of low molecular weight heparin in the
treatment of stroke moved a step closer last December, with the
publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, of a study showing
that nadroparin calcium (Fraxiparine - Sanofi) improved outcome when
given within 48 hours of a stroke.

Sanofi, clearly delighted at the results, this week hosted an
international press conference to publicise the study - and to announce
the new trial.

The NEJM "Fraxiparine in Stroke Study (FISS)" involved 306 stroke
patients at four Hong Kong hospitals. Patients received high dose
nadroparin (4100 anti-factor Xa IU twice daily), low-dose nadroparin
(4100IU once daily) or placebo subcutaneously for 10 days.

Three and six months after treatment there were no significant
differences in the primary endpoints of death or dependency (defined as
the need for help with everyday activities). However, there was a
significant improvement in the combined endpoint of death or dependency
(p=0.12 at three months and 0.005 at six months). By the end of six
months, 45 per cent of patients on high dose Fraxiparine, 52 per cent
of patients on low dose Fraxiparine, and 65 per cent of patients in the
control group had poor outcomes (ie had died or become dependent on
others for daily living).

"Our data suggest that for every five patients treated, one death or
case of dependency may be avoided," reported Dr Richard Kay, Associate
Professor of Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong.

However, at this week's meeting, he said the results - although
promising - did not warrant routine use of Fraxiparine in all stroke
patients. In order to get the 312 patients randomised, 2,750 stroke
patients were screened.

The major exclusion criteria were the wrong type of stroke
(haemorrhagic rather than ischaemic); age (>80); or arriving too late
for treatment (later than 48 hours post-stroke).

In the US, heparins are widely used in the treatment of stroke despite
a lack of evidence that they work, said Dr Kay. He estimates that some
30-50 per cent of US patients receive predominately older standard
heparins.

New low molecular weight heparins, such as Fraxiparine, have several
advantages over these older products. They can be administered
subcutaneously making home treatment feasible, they are better
tolerated, and the results of treatment are more predictable.

With Fraxiparine antithrombotic activity is guaranteed for at least 24
hours without the need for laboratory monitoring. Patients treated with
standard heparin need daily blood tests to monitor anticoagulant
activity. With these advantages, and a positive result from a second
confirmatory study, the market for low molecular weight heparins could
expand substantially.

Heparins are currently used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis,
and peri- or post-operative surgical thromboprophylaxis. World wide,
some 200 million units of heparins are sold annually.

Since their introduction in the mid 1980's, low molecular weight
heparins have gradually been taking a larger slice of this total -
amounting to about half of the units sold in 1995. Of the low molecular
weight heparins, three companies account for the lion's share of sales;
Sanofi with Fraxiparine (32 per cent of all units sold); Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer with enoxaparin (28 per cent) and Kabi Pharmacia/Upjohn with
Fragmin (20 per cent).

Fraxiparine was worth $650 million in 1995. Company analysts are
confident of a massive boost in sales, if the new study confirms the
FISS results. World wide, some 1.5 million people suffer a stroke each
year. "We hope to capture at least 30 per cent of this market. With
Fraxiparine selling at $5 to $10 for a days treatment, this amounts to
a considerable turnover," said Francine Jacob, Strategic Marketing,
Sanofi.

"This growth will really depend on the outcome of the new study. The
results will be available in 1997 and should lead to registration and
formal approval for this indication. We would anticipate the first
approval in Europe, followed by Asia and North America," she said.

The new study will duplicate FISS, but with more subjects (800 stroke
patients) drawn from a wider range of countries.

ZENECA TO LAUNCH NISOLDIPINE IN US

Zeneca has acquired the US rights and full marketing control for a new
calcium channel blocker, nisoldipine (Sular), recently approved by the
FDA. The company which will launch the product this month is still
negotiating marketing rights for other countries.

Sular is in a controlled release formulation to allow once daily dosing
and will be marketed for hypertension as Sular Extended Release
tablets, says Zeneca.

The product has been acquired to boost Zeneca's cardiovascular
portfolio which includes the world's No 3 ACE inhibitor Zestril, the
largest selling beta-blocker Tenormin and Sorbitrate, the nitrate.

Despite the recent controversy over calcium channel blockers, the
market has been growing and has a current estimated value of #4.4
billion worldwide and #2.2 billion in the US.

Arimidex, Zeneca's aromatase inhibitor, has been cleared for treatment
of advanced breast cancer in the US. The drug was approved for use in
the UK last Autumn and has been submitted to all major markets outside
Japan.

In the US 18,000 women have advanced breast cancer and the expected
number of new cases diagnosed each year is 184,300. The US market for
hormonal breast cancer therapies is valued at $300 million.

The approval follows FDA clearance for Zeneca's other new treatment for
advanced breast cancer Zoladex, announced mid December. Zoladex,
injected once monthly, is indicated for premenopausal and
perimenopausal women and avoids the need for oophorectomy. One third of
new cases of breast cancer are in the pre and perimenopausal age groups
and 6 per cent of new cases have advanced disease.

Zoladex, which won a Queen's award for technology five years ago, was
approved in the US in 1989 for advanced prostate cancer and in 1993 for
endometriosis. It is already earning in excess of $60 million in the
US. Zeneca announced FDA approval of the drug in its three month depot
formulation (Zoladex LA) for prostate cancer on 12 January. Treatment
reduces testosterone to castration levels and avoids the need for
orchidectomy. The drug is already approved for pre and peri-menopausal
breast cancer in 72 countries.

LEUKOTRIENE ANTAGONISTS TIPPED AS ASTHMA MARKET LEADERS

Leukotriene receptor antagonists are tipped to become the leading
product group in the respiratory drug market of the early years of the
21st century with 20 per cent of asthma sales and 14 per cent of the
total respiratory market. Merck, Zeneca, Abbott and SmithKline Beecham
are companies new to the respiratory market which will profit from the
new drug class.

The projection comes in a new report from the Pharma Strategy Group of
IMS based on an analysis of IMS data and interviews with 80 opinion
leaders, which sees total drug sales for respiratory disorders growing
by 47 per cent in six major markets - Germany, France, UK, Italy, Japan
and the US. Total sales are projected at $14.1 billion by the year 2005
against the current $9.5 billion.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors which have both bronchodilatory and anti-
inflammatory effects in asthma, as well as possible applications in
rhinitis and dermatitis, are predicted to reach the marketplace by the
year 200? and to hold 7 per cent of asthma sales by 2005.

P&U GETS FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET NEW ANTIARRHYTHMIC

Pharmacia &Upjohn, Inc announced US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval to market Corvert Injection (ibutilide fumarate injection),
used to treat the common arrhythmias of atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter. Corvert is used to achieve rapid conversion of atrial
fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm.

The frequency of arrhythmias increases with age. Atrial fibrillation
affects .4 per cent of Americans under the age of 60 and 2 to 4 per
cent of those over 60. The primary treatment option for patients
needing rapid conversion of atrial fibril action and flutter is
electrical cardioversion. Drugs are not rapidly effective and usually
require one to three days of hospitalisation, dose titration and
observation. Two large, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and
randomised clinical trials demonstrated that, compared to placebo,
Corvert Injection successfully and rapidly converted atrial
fibrillation and flutter to normal rhythm. In a third study in Europe,
Corvert compared quite well with another intravenous antiarrhythmic
agent.

Joann L Data, corporate vice-president for world-wide pharmaceutical
regulatory affairs and project management, said "Corvert is a novel
agent, that provides a pharmacological alternative for a difficult
management problem. Currently, no medicines are approved to provide
rapid pharmacological conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter to normal sinus rhythm".

FDA APPROVES ORTHO'S RENOVA

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for marketing, 2
January, Renova, 0.05 per cent tretinoin emollient cream.) as a
treatment for reducing certain kinds of skin damage, such as fine
wrinkles, spotty discoloration and rough skin. Renova was developed by
the Dermatological Division of Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation
(Raritan, NJ), a subsidiary of Johnson and Johnson. It is an offshoot
of the company's acne product, Retin-A. Renova is formulated as an
emollient cream, which differentiates it from Retin-A. Renova was
approved for damaged skin, in conjunction with a co prehensive skin
care and sun avoidance programme. Its effectiveness is dependent on
other good skin care practices including avoiding direct sunlight,
applying sunscreens, wearing protective clothing and using moisturising
lotions. FDA notes that many people can enhance skin appearance and
protect skin from damage by adopting regular use of these practices and
not using Renova.

It does not eliminate wrinkles, repair sun damaged skin, reverse the
ageing process or photo ageing or repair factors leading to skin cancer.
Nor is there evidence that Renova treats deep wrinkles, coarse skin,
skin yellowing or other skin problems. Studies have shown that after 24
weeks, approximately 30 per cent of users had moderate improvement of
their fine wrinkles or spotty discoloration, 34 per cent had minimal
improvement and 35 per cent had no improvement. Furthermore, about 16
per cent of users had moderate improvement in skin roughness, 35 per
cent saw minimal improvement and 49 per cent had no improvement.
Patients using Renova noticed some improvement between three to six
months. Improvements gradually diminished when treatment stopped. The
safety of daily use for more than 48 weeks has not been established.
Renova has not been studied in people age 50 or older, or in people
with moderately or darkly pigmented skin. Safe use in children has not
been shown and pregnant patients are warned not to use this cream.
Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp will begin marketing Renova in February l996.
The company estimates costs for the patient of $10-$15 per month. The
average retail price for the 40 gram tube that usually lasts four to
six months is $60. It will be available, also, in tubes containing 60
grams. The company, that markets in more than 100 countries and employs
approximately 2,000 workers, sells Renova in Ireland and the UK, having
received approval for the drug in those countries in 1993 and 1995
respectively. In 1995, Renova was also approved in Canada. Ortho's
spokesperson told PBN that Renova has been filed in Mexico, France,
Portugal, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand. The discovery
that Retin-A reduces wrinkles and photoageing was made by Dr Albert
Kligman of Pennsylvania University. The university and its agent
Competitive Technologies will receive royalties on US and foreign
sales.

drug pramipexole following the conclusion of three large scale Phase
III trials. The dopamine agonist, discovered by Boehringer Ingelheim
and co-developed with Pharmacia & Upjohn, is indicated for both the
early and late stages of disease. Early use of pramipexole is expected
to delay the onset of complications seen in late stage disease after
early use of levodopa therapy. Preclinical studies have shown the drug
has advantages over levodopa in binding preferentially to the D3
receptor and acting as a full dopamine agonist.

CITY TALK

Sector analysts increasingly are recommending an overweight position in
the US pharmaceuticals sector, with faster approvals from the FDA in
1995 said to have helped bolster new product prospects. Proposals for
FDA reform should ensure a continuing improvement in the rate of
approvals by the agency and a lowering of the review time required.
Despite a weaker Dow Jones Industrial Average, Merck gained $1-1/2 on
15 January. In late December Merck outlined its growth strategy in a
presentation to analysts, saying it would grow sales with effective
promotion of existing products, by providing value to managed care
customers with Medco and through R&D support to ensure future new
product flows. It was disclosed that Merck's products account for 13
per cent of Medco's sales, the highest of any drug company and up from
11.5 per cent a year ago. One analyst, maintaining a hold
recommendation on the shares, highlighted the huge margins generated
from the Astra Merck joint venture, estimated at around 50 per cent.
Merck's vaccine business, including joint ventures, has sales
approaching $1 billion a year. Johnson & Johnson, up $1-1/8 to $84-7/8
in morning trade on 12 January, was upgraded to near-term buy by one
Wall Street analyst. Industry consolidation looks set to continue
through much of 1996. Hygenics Pharmaceuticals, a US company that
develops premium generic drugs, announced it was in preliminary talks
to merge with an unidentified pharmaceutical manufacturing company.

In the UK, the majority of analysts have turned neutral after the
sector's stunning performance in 1995 - the pharmaceutical sector
outperformed the All-Share index by about 35 per cent last year - and
recommend profit-taking ahead of the anticipated economic recovery.
"More people are looking to take profits rather than to build up
weightings," said one analyst. That said, Glaxo Wellcome, Medeva and
SmithKline Beecham are tipped to perform well this year, with some
analysts continuing to recommend an overweight investment stance.
Shares in SmithKline Beecham, at 719p on 5 January, have risen strongly
over the past 12 months, up more than 50 per cent, and boosted recently
by keen interest from US investors. Better-than-average earnings growth
over the next two years should bolster the stock's investor appeal.
Analysts estimate full-year underlying pre-tax profits of around #1.35
billion and reported pharmaceutical sales growth in excess of 12 per
cent when 1995 results are announced on 20 February. Margins at DPS
however are considered weaker than first thought at the time of the
acquisition. Strong deal-making efforts are likely to see Medeva
outperform, with the shares considered cheap at current levels.
Although the shares have risen more than 40 per cent relative to the
market over the past 12 months, further headway is likely as the
company demonstrates the potential of its restored growth and sound
underlying strategy. Analysts highlight the growth potential from a
generic version of Glaxo Wellcome's Ventolin and anaesthetic gases from
Inhalon. In December the US FDA approved the first generic inhaled
asthma drug, Ivax's aerosol formulation of salbutamol. Full-year
results for the year to end December will be announced in late
February. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of around #77
million, an increase of over 20 per cent on 1994. The results also
include a #1.5 million charge in relation to settlement of a
shareholder suit tied to the company's share price fall in 1993. Last
week Glaxo Wellcome issued a $500 million 10-year Eurobond, completing
its debt restructuring programme following the #9.5 billion acquisition
of Wellcome. On 15 January, rating agency Standard & Poor's affirmed
its AA minus long-term and A1 plus short-term ratings of Glaxo Wellcome
and revised its outlook to stable from negative. The positive re-rating
acknowledges the strength of Glaxo Wellcome's research pipeline and its
strong cash-generating ability. Risks remain however, including
uncertainties over the group's ability to generate the anticipated cost
savings and the threat of a higher-than-anticipated decline in sales of
Zantac. "Glaxo Wellcome is at a discount to the sector because of
uncertainty over Zovirax, Zantac and the rationalisation benefits.
Zeneca, which last week received FDA approval for its Zoladex prostate
cancer treatment, drifted lower, closing the week off 2.8 per cent at
1230p. Takeover speculation apart, the shares are described as
overvalued.

European drug stocks, strengthened by firmer product and market
strategies, face a bright year ahead. Hafslund Nycomed, Synthelabo and
Sandoz are expected to perform in line or ahead of their respective
markets over the next six months. Shares in the latter surged more than
60 per cent in absolute terms in the past year but are now likely to
consolidate around current levels.

SPORTS AND EXERCISE DURING ACUTE ILLNESS
Recommending the Right Course for Patients

By:
William A. Primos, Jr, MD

In brief: Active people who suffer acute infectious illness may have
questions concerning participation in exercise or sports during their
illness. Many patients are reluctant to ``get behind'' on their training or
``let down the team.'' Physical activity, however, may worsen the
condition, result in impaired performance, or infect others. On the other
hand, some contagious diseases are relatively benign, and some activities
don't affect others. Therefore, clinicians need to understand both the
sport and the illness to know what level of activity to recommend. For
example, solo exercise at a reduced intensity is generally safe for
patients whose symptoms are above the neck.

   Although regular exercise can help improve health, even well-trained
athletes develop acute infectious diseases. Most physicians advise patients
to rest during an acute illness. However, highly motivated athletes and
exercisers often have a variety of reasons to continue athletic activities
during an illness:
   -- Marcia is a 30-year-old runner training for a marathon. She develops
infectious gastroenteritis. She does not want to miss a day of running and
fall behind in her training schedule. Despite several episodes of diarrhea
the night before, she decides to accompany her friends on their usual
Saturday morning 20-mile run. The weather that day is unusually warm and
humid. During the run she collapses and suffers heatstroke.
   -- Mark, a 16-year-old wrestler, has influenza. Tomorrow the conference
tournament will be held, which he must win to qualify for the state
championships. His symptoms include headaches, chills, and myalgia. His
temperature is 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C). Mark decides to enter the
tournament. In his first-round match he loses to an opponent he had easily
defeated 2 weeks before. Mark's team receives no points in his weight class
and is narrowly defeated for the team championship.
   -- Michelle is a 32-year-old aerobics instructor who has an
upper-respiratory tract infection with rhinorrhea and a sore throat. She is
scheduled to teach two classes tonight and one tomorrow morning and cannot
find a substitute instructor. She slightly alters the routine for her
classes, decreasing the number of high-intensity steps and increasing the
time spent stretching. She is able to complete her classes, has no
worsening of symptoms, and is asymptomatic 2 days later.
   Patients with acute infectious diseases often have questions about
participation in athletic activities. What effect does exercise have on an
infection? Can physical exertion worsen the problem?
   Physicians should be able to determine what level of activity is safe
for their patients with infectious diseases and to explain to the patients
who need restrictions why they should avoid sports. An understanding of
athletes' susceptibility to infection, effects of illness on physical
performance, risks of exercising during an illness, and general guidelines
about determining playability will guide the physician's recommendations.

How Susceptible to Infection?
   Does regular exercise and physical conditioning affect susceptibility to
infection? Do athletes have altered immunity? A number of factors can
affect a physically active person's risk of acquiring an infection.
   Active people may be placed at increased risk of contracting infectious
diseases because of increased exposure. Athletes are often in close contact
with other participants who may carry pathogens. Transmission may occur
through a number of different mechanisms. Training and competition often
involve heavy respiration, coughing, and spitting. These acts may transmit
nasopharyngeal secretions containing infectious organisms. Direct
transmission may occur by bodies touching in some contact sports. Infection
may also be transmitted by contact with contaminated objects such as mats,
towels, and water bottles.
   Some studies1,2 (Reference) have shown that intense physical training
may lead to a suppressed immune system and an increased susceptibility to
infection. A recent study3 showed that natural killer cell activity
increased immediately after high-intensity exercise, but decreased 1 hour
and 2 hours after both moderate- and high-intensity exercise. These changes
may have been due to a shift of the natural killer cells from the blood to
peripheral tissues.
   Eichner4 (Reference) reviewed several studies dealing with exercise and
the immune system. Some showed alterations in the immune system by
exercise. Most of the data, however, were inconclusive about whether the
changes that occurred in the immune system were clinically important. Also,
some changes in immunity in athletes may be attributable to emotional
stress.
   Even if exercise does not increase susceptibility to illness, physical
activity may make people more sensitive to symptoms. Minor symptoms such as
nasal congestion or a cough are likely to be noticed by a runner during a
train- ing session but may be overlooked by a sedentary person.

Harmful Effects
   In making a decision about whether an individual should participate in
athletics, a number of different factors should be considered. The primary
area of concern is how exercise would affect the health of the patient.
Could exercise worsen symptoms, cause complications, or delay recovery?
   Strenuous exercise may result in more severe symptoms. Studies have
shown that intense exercise during the incubation phase of an infection can
increase the severity of the illness.1 (Reference) This may be related to
suppression of the immune system during exercise.
   Exercising with an infection also carries some disease-specific health
risks. Symptoms of a respiratory tract infection, for example, may worsen
with exercise. These infections are often associated with inflammation of
the airways and increased bronchial secretions. In individuals with asthma
or reactive airways caused by a respiratory tract infection, strenuous
exercise may cause bronchospasm, with increased cough, wheezing, and
dyspnea.
   Splenic rupture is a potentially fatal complication of infectious
mononucleosis. Physicians restrict patients who have infectious
mononucleosis from strenuous athletic activities for extended periods
because of the perceived risk of splenic rupture from direct trauma or
exertion.5 (Reference) The decision on the proper time for resuming
athletic activity is controversial, ranging from 1 to 6 months after the
onset of the illness.5-8 (Reference) Since only enlarged spleens rupture,
and because almost all splenic ruptures occur in the first 3 weeks of
illness,6 (Reference) the following criteria may be used for determining
the proper time for return to athletic activity, assuming the patient is
also asymptomatic:
   -- For light, nonstrenuous exercise, patients can resume activity 3
weeks after the onset of the illness as long as the spleen is not markedly
enlarged on physical examination.
   -- For strenuous and contact sports, patients can resume activity
approximately 1 month after the onset of the illness if the spleen is not
enlarged on palpation. (Physical examination may not be reliable for
determining spleen size. Therefore, ultrasonography should be considered
for assessing spleen size in a patient who wishes to return to strenuous or
contact sports before 1 month.)
   Another group of diseases that might be worsened or complicated by
exercise is infection with enteroviruses such as coxsackieviruses.
Enteroviruses usually cause respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, but
they may also cause myocarditis.9 (Reference) (See ``Viral Myocarditis:
Detection and Management, July 1995, page 63.) Studies on viral myocarditis
in mice found that strenuous exercise can result in myocardial necrosis and
cardiac dilation, which often led to death from pulmonary edema.10
(Reference) Myocarditis has also been implicated as a cause of sudden death
during exercise in humans11 (Reference) and has been reported as the most
frequent cause of sudden death in military recruits.12 (Reference) Because
of the potential for myocarditis, it has been recommended that people who
have systemic symptoms such as fever and myalgia avoid strenuous
exercise.11 (Reference)

Impaired Performance
   A different factor to consider in determining playability is impaired
performance. Acute illness can hinder athletic performance by influencing
several different body systems.
   Cardiac function may be altered during acute infections, especially
those accompanied by fever. Cardiac output and cardiac stroke volume may
decrease during systemic febrile viral infections. These effects were found
in subjects who were inoculated with sandfly fever virus.13 (Reference) In
another study,14 (Reference) individuals with febrile illness showed higher
oxygen uptake and higher maximal heart rate during exercise. Still another
study15 found acute disturbance of myocardial electrical and mechanical
function in subjects who had viral infections.
   Acute viral respiratory tract infections can affect pulmonary function.
For example, research studies have shown respiratory infections to impair
pulmonary gas exchange, though the impairment is not serious. A possible
explanation for this effect could be mild bronchiolitis that results in
mild ventilation-perfusion abnormalities.16 (Reference) Additionally,
rhinovirus infection may produce transient peripheral airway abnormalities,
which are detected by measuring the dynamic compliance of the lungs and
also are not serious. In a study by Blair et al,17 (Reference) five of
eight individuals with rhinovirus infection developed increased lung
compliance with higher respiration rates. These changes were transient,
usually resolving in 2 weeks.
   Viral infections can also affect the muscular system. Studies9,13,18
(Reference) have shown impaired skeletal muscle performance and strength
during acute viral infections. One study13 found that all subjects had
decreased muscle strength and function, and another18 (Reference) showed
that 9 of 10 subjects had statistically significant loss of isometric and
dynamic strength and muscle endurance.
   Some infectious diseases may alter an active person's fluid status.
Acute infectious diseases, especially those with gastroenteritis and fever,
often result in reduced fluid intake and increased fluid losses. A fluid
deficit of as little as 2% to 3% of body weight stresses the circulatory
system and can impair endurance.19,20 (Reference)
   Low levels of body fluid could also affect temperature regulation since
less perspiration results in dissipation of less body heat. Although body
temperature normally rises during exercise, exercisers who have a fever
experience an even greater rise.21 (Reference) Impaired fluid status and
thermoregulation caused by febrile illness could put an active person in
danger of developing heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and circulatory
collapse.
   Because of these effects on the various body systems, acute infectious
illness may result in decreased endurance, strength, speed, concentration,
or any combination of these factors. If an athlete is unable to perform
adequately, the goals of the team would probably be better served by using
another team member who is able to perform at a higher level.
   Because of the previously discussed physiologic effects of acute febrile
viral infections, it is logical to assume that working out during a viral
illness would impart fewer fitness gains than would working out while
healthy. Patients who are concerned about losing training time can be
reminded of this supposition.

Risk of Infecting Others
   Playability decisions are also affected by whether other people would be
put at risk by the infected person's participation. To determine the risk
of transmission, one must consider the period of contagiousness, the mode
of transmission, and the type of contact. If the illness is potentially
severe and is in the contagious period--and the type of contact would put
others at risk of infection--participation should be avoided. Athletes
should be encouraged to consider the health and welfare of others more
important than their participation in sports.
   Measles is an infection that can be transmitted to others through sports
participation. Measles is a highly contagious illness for those who are not
immune and is transmitted person to person via aerosol droplets. Measles
transmission during athletic events such as the 1991 International Special
Olympics and the Maryland high school state wrestling tournament has been
documented.22 (Reference) The period of contagiousness for measles lasts
until 4 days after the appearance of the rash; people with measles should
be disqualified from sports participation during this period.
   Epidemic pleurodynia, or epidemic myalgia, is characterized by abrupt
onset of chest or abdominal pain and fever. The usual pathogen is
coxsackievirus B. Outbreaks of this disease have been reported on football
and soccer teams. In an outbreak on a New York high school football team, a
possible mode of transmission was shared water containers.23 (Reference)
   In a recent review of infectious diseases in sports in the United
States, the most common disease spread by person-to-person contact was
herpes simplex,24 (Reference) with 12 documented reports among wrestlers
and rugby players. Close contact is required for transmission. The disease
can be spread either via body fluids or by direct contact of the lesions
with uninfected skin or mucous membranes. The risk of transmission is
increased if the uninfected skin is abraded or otherwise damaged. To
prevent spread of herpes simplex, infected athletes should be disqualified
from contact sports until all lesions are crusted over or healed.

Practical Advice
   Physicians need to educate patients about exercising during an acute
illness, limiting spread of the disease, and preventing infection in the
first place (see the patient handout ``Exercising--or Not--When You Are
Sick'' on page 55). As pointed out by Goodman et al,24 (Reference) athletes
should be reminded that by their participation in sports, others may be put
at risk of acquiring infection. If infection could be transmitted during
the sport, participation should be avoided.
   In addition, athletes should be immunized against preventable diseases
such as measles, mumps, tetanus, rubella, and, possibly, hepatitis B.
Diseases such as enteroviral infections can be prevented by avoiding shared
water bottles and towels. Also, healthcare providers need to report
outbreaks of infectious diseases to public health officials to allow
control measures.
   Active people who do develop acute infectious illnesses should be
advised that the benefits of exercise are decreased during illness and that
they might as well wait until they have recovered. Patients should also be
informed that participation in strenuous exercise may be dangerous to their
health.
   To help prevent serious complications such as myocarditis, patients can
use a ``neck check'' of symptoms.4 (Reference) If the person has only
``above the neck'' symptoms, such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sore
throat, then he or she can probably safely try participation. However, if
the patient has ``below the neck'' symptoms, such as myalgia, hacking
cough, fever, or chills, it would be wise to refrain from intense physical
activity. By following these recommendations, patients who have acute
illnesses may avoid complications and make a safe return to full activity.

DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF EXERCISE-INDUCED ASTHMA

By:
Ned T. Rupp, MEd, MD

   In brief: Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) affects 12% to 15% of the
general population. Its symptoms include chest tightness, shortness of
breath, coughing, wheezing, fatigue, and prolonged recovery times after
exercise. Diagnosis depends on accurate history, physical examination, and
lung function testing. Nonpharmacologic management includes modification of
both activity and ambient conditions, along with rigorous patient
education. Short-acting inhaled beta (subscript) 2 agonists are the
pharmacologic treatment of choice for isolated and breakthrough EIA.
Anti-inflammatory medications such as inhaled cromolyn sodium, nedocromil
sodium, and corticosteroids are used to control underlying asthma as well
as EIA. Other agents such as oral theophylline or long-acting beta agonists
may be important but their roles aren't clearly defined.

   When undiagnosed, exercise-induced asthma (EIA), a common clinical
syndrome characterized by a transient increase in airway resistance
following several minutes of exercise,1,2 (Reference) can be an obstacle to
an active lifestyle. But when the disease is identified and well managed,
the results can be remarkable for patients of all activity levels. Of the
597 members of the 1984 United States Olympic Team, 67 (11.2%) experienced
EIA.3 (Reference) The athletes who had EIA won 41 medals during the games.
Their superb achievements indicate the high level of performance that
people who have EIA can reach with appropriate therapy.

How Common is EIA?
   EIA affects a broad segment of the population. Up to 90% of people who
have asthma experience EIA during the course of their disease, and most
consider exercise to be a major precipitant of their asthma.4-6 (Reference)
In addition, 35% to 40% of patients who have allergic rhinitis experience
EIA precipitated by allergens, viruses, cold air, air pollutants, or a
combination of these factors.2,4-7 (Reference) The general population who
are not diagnosed as asthmatic and do not have noted respiratory allergies
have a much lower EIA incidence of 3% to 10%. Combining these groups gives
an overall EIA incidence of 12% to 15%.8 (Reference) The incidence is
somewhat higher in children than in adults.8 (Reference)
   Among active people, the incidence of EIA ranges from 3% to more than
12%.3,6,9-11 (Reference) The presence of EIA in active people, however, may
be underreported, as many athletes may not be aware they have the
condition. The symptoms of EIA can often be perceived as part of the
experience of normal vigorous exercise.11 (Reference) In addition, denial
of illness is common among young athletes.

When Exercise Obstructs
   Asthma is an obstructive disease of the airways characterized by airway
inflammation and hyperreactivity. Airflow obstruction is influenced by
bronchial wall edema, mucus production, airway smooth muscle contraction,
and hypertrophy. The obstruction may be initiated by inflammatory events in
the airways, particularly the release of inflammatory mediators from mast
cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells. Airway hyperreactivity is an
exaggerated bronchoconstriction response to various stimuli including
allergens, environmental irritants, viral respiratory infections, cold air,
and exercise. Airway obstruction brought on by exercise is termed EIA.
   The etiology of EIA is probably multifactorial. Though much has been
discovered about EIA, complete understanding of the pathophysiology of the
disease has not yet been obtained. For example, the concept of airway
inflammation contributing to asthma is relatively new, and its impact on
management of the disease is still being determined.
   There is a general consensus that the airway obstruction that develops
in EIA is related to thermodynamic events within the airway during
hyperpnea. As a result of hyperventilation during and after exercise, the
upper airway is unable to bring inspired air to body temperature and 100%
humidity. Heat and water are drawn from the respiratory tissue in order to
warm and humidify the inspired air, resulting in respiratory tissue water
loss and airway cooling.12-14 (Reference)
   Typically, EIA begins with bronchodilation either during or immediately
following exercise. All people experience bronchodilation in response to
exercise. Normally, widening of the glottis and bronchodilation meet the
increased oxygen requirements during exercise. In EIA, however, the glottis
widens but the lower airways constrict. Respiratory demand increases, and
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV (subscript) 1) and peak
expiratory flow rate (PEFR) decrease significantly. Maximal
bronchoconstriction generally occurs 3 to 15 minutes after exercise
ceases.15 (Reference) Factors that can vary the usual bronchoconstriction
timing include environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, air
quality, or pollens; the type, duration, or intensity of the exercise; the
time from a previous exercise session; and the degree of bronchial
hyperreactivity.
   With a second exercise challenge, less than half of the original degree
of obstruction will occur--this is defined as the refractory period.
Approximately half of patients are refractory within 1 hour, but nearly
everyone loses the effect after 2 to 3 hours. It is impossible to predict
whether a person will be refractory to EIA, and occurrence of a refractory
period may be intermittent in any patient. Original bronchospasm severity
plays no role in a patient's refractory status, though certain factors
encourage the refractory period: a warm-up session before exercise;
breathing or exercising in warm, humid air; and prolonged submaximal
exercise.
   Though most patients recover from EIA within 1 hour,2 (Reference) late
asthmatic responses that occur 3 to 9 hours after exercise have been
reported.16,17 (Reference) Patients at higher risk for late responses
appear to be children and those with severe early responses.2 (Reference)
Some investigators have doubted the existence of this late response or its
clinical relevance19 (Reference) because bronchoconstriction during the
late response is usually much less severe.
   In other words, repeated exercise challenge during the refractory period
may still reduce FEV (subscript) 1 and PEFR, but less than half as much as
with the initial postchallenge reduction.18 (Reference)
   The factors that influence the severity of EIA (table 1) are similar to
those that affect the refractory period and include the degree of
underlying bronchial hyperreactivity; duration, type and intensity of
exercise; environmental conditions; exposure to allergens; respiratory
infections; interval since the last episode of EIA (refractory period);16
(Reference) and low fitness level. Environmental factors such as cold, dry
air, airborne allergens such as pollens or house dust mites, and air
pollutants can exacerbate EIA. In patients with EIA who are susceptible to
allergens, antigen challenge during exercise has been found to double the
intensity of EIA.20 (Reference) Therefore, designing an individual
treatment regimen requires consideration of seasonal and geographic
factors. Activities such as running and cycling that require high levels of
activity at or near maximal levels of aerobic capacity are most likely to
cause EIA. Generally, the more vigorous the exercise, the more rapid and
severe the bronchospasm.21 (Reference) The relationship of duration of
exercise to intensity of EIA is more complex. With a short period of
activity, the severity of bronchospasm is related to exercise length;
however, some patients find that if they continue to exercise after
symptoms develop, they may be able to ``run through'' their
bronchospasm.2,8 (Reference) This effect may be related to the refractory
period.

EIA Workup Strategies
   In the workup of a patient who has suspected EIA, a thorough history is
vital (table 2). The signs and symptoms of EIA are typically those of
classic airway obstruction: dyspnea, cough, and chest tightness with or
without wheezing, though some patients may also complain of
gastrointestinal discomfort. EIA may also present as chest pain in children
and adolescents.22 (Reference) Without a careful history, possibly
augmented by teammates, coaches, family, or friends, these signs and
symptoms may be easily misinterpreted as postexercise fatigue. Also, denial
of symptoms is common, especially among student-athletes because of peer
pressure, embarrassment, and fear of losing their place on the team.11
(Reference)
   A careful physical examination of the upper and lower respiratory tracts
is important. However, because of the episodic nature of EIA, the physical
exam is often normal despite the presence of significant disease. The
pharynx should be examined for mucus indicating postnasal drainage.
Examination of the nose may reveal erythema, congestion, and enlarged
turbinates. Sinuses should be percussed to assess for tenderness.
Examination of the lower respiratory tract should include auscultation of
the lungs to determine the presence of a prolonged expiratory phase,
wheezing, or coughing with inspiration.
   Pulmonary function testing is an integral part of EIA diagnosis. Initial
FEV (subscript) 1, forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV (subscript) 1/FVC
ratio, and PEFR values should be determined. FEV (subscript) 1 and FEV
(subscript) 1/FVC values below 80% of predicted value indicate obstructive
airway disease. Caution should accompany a diagnosis based on PEFR
measurements: Peak flow is highly effort dependent, and a low PEFR may
indicate either obstructive or restrictive respiratory disease. Once the
EIA diagnosis has been made, PEFR measurements may be useful in following
the course of the disease and response to treatment.
   However, many patients have symptoms of EIA but a normal resting
pulmonary function test. These patients may require inhalation challenge,
exercise challenge, or a therapeutic trial to establish the diagnosis. (See
``Exercise Challenge for Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm: Confirming
Presence, Evaluating Control,'' August 1995, page 47.) Furthermore, active
patients often have lung function well above normal predicted values; for
example, a 30% drop in a patient with 150% of normal function may appear
satisfactory, but could represent a bronchospastic problem for that
individual.
   Bronchoprovocation testing is sensitive for diagnosing hyperreactive
airways.6 (Reference) Patients inhale gradually increasing concentrations
of a bronchoconstrictor, usually methacholine (though histamine may also be
used), while spirometric changes in airflow are recorded. The degree of
airway hyperreactivity is related to the amount of bronchoconstrictor
required to cause bronchospasm. Another laboratory test that has gained
popularity is bronchoprovocation with cold air.
   Exercise challenge testing involves determining baseline lung function
before exercise and measuring forced expiration at 5- to 10-minute
intervals following exercise for 15 to 30 minutes. Exercise challenge
should consist of 6 to 10 minutes of strenuous exercise at 85% to 90% of
the predicted maximal heart rate. Postexercise decreases of 10% to 20% in
FEV (subscript) 1 indicate mild EIA, 20% to 40% moderate, and more than 40%
severe.23 (Reference) When the patient's history is compatible with EIA yet
spirometry at 15 minutes is nondiagnostic, a prolonged postexercise
evaluation is necessary.15 (Reference)
   Exercise challenge is less sensitive than methacholine challenge, so
negative results do not exclude the diagnosis of EIA; however, exercise
testing is highly specific for EIA, and positive results provide good
assurance of the presence of the disease. Results of provocation testing
may vary due to the influences of allergens, air pollution, temperature, or
upper respiratory infections. These same factors can account for the
seasonal occurrence of EIA in many people.
   Because a patient who has EIA may have normal ``at rest'' pulmonary
function, a history consistent with EIA should prompt patient education
about the condition and its treatment. A trial of a short-acting beta
(subscript) 2 agonist prior to exercise, with symptom monitoring by the
patient, is often the next appropriate step. Follow-up exercise challenge
is often unnecessary in cases of clear benefit, so this strategy can be a
very cost-effective management approach.
   Challenge testing is warranted when the patient history is unclear or
when the patient's coach or parents have brought the symptoms to the
physician's attention. Testing can help avoid overuse or unnecessary use of
medication when the patient's breathing problems are caused by anxiety,
hyperventilation syndrome, poor conditioning, upper airway obstruction, or
seasonal EIA. Finally, an exercise challenge can not only reproduce the
symptoms for the patient, but also encourage compliance by demonstrating
the effectiveness of therapy.

Nonpharmacologic Interventions
   The goal of EIA management is to allow patients to participate fully in
athletic activities without difficulty. The ultimate success of
pharmacologic therapy will depend on the following nonpharmacologic
strategies: activity modification, improvement in ambient air conditions,
and patient education.
   Management should begin with efforts to increase physical conditioning,
which can reduce the requirements for pharmacotherapy and decrease the
incidence of asthma attacks.7,24 (Reference) Also, short bursts of activity
have been shown to decrease EIA.25 (Reference) By incorporating warm-up
activities into their exercise program, patients may be able to take
advantage of the refractory period and decrease the frequency and severity
of bronchospastic episodes.
   Warm, humid environments or breathing in warm, humid air will ameliorate
EIA and will improve the patient's chances of being refractory to repeated
exercise challenge over the next 1 to 3 hours. Wearing a face mask during
activity warms and humidifies inspired air when outdoor conditions are cold
and dry. Breathing through the nose rather than the mouth will filter,
warm, and humidify inspired air.
   Education can boost the effectiveness of other therapeutic
interventions. Patients must be aware of the conditions that exacerbate
their disease and how to avoid them, early signs of an impending asthma
attack, and appropriate use of medications for prevention and flares.

Pharmacologic Options
   The pharmacologic goals of treating EIA are preventing the onset of
asthma episodes and treating breakthrough episodes that may occur following
exercise. Several classes of drugs with bronchodilating and
anti-inflammatory effects are used to treat EIA, including beta agonists,
cromolyn sodium, nedocromil sodium, and corticosteroids--all most
frequently given by inhalation--and oral theophylline.
   Beta agonists are the drugs of choice for preventing isolated EIA and
for on-demand treatment of exercise-induced acute asthma
exacerbations.2,6,7,15,24,26 (Reference) This group includes the
established short-acting agents albuterol, bitolterol mesylate,
metaproterenol sulfate, pirbuterol acetate, terbutaline sulfate, and the
newer, longer-acting salmeterol. Both short and long-acting beta agonists
are effective in nearly all patients who have asthma--those with chronic
obstruction and those who have only exercise-related obstruction. However,
short-acting beta agonists are the most effective agents for preventing
EIA, and are effective in 80% to 95% of patients.27 (Reference) They
reverse contraction of bronchial smooth muscle and are very effective
bronchodilators.28 (Reference) In the laboratory, beta agonists have
exhibited some anti-inflammatory activity through stabilization of mast
cells and prevention of release of histamine and other inflammatory
mediators; however, the clinical relevance of these effects is not yet
known.29 (Reference) Short-acting inhaled beta agonists have a rapid onset
of action, usually within 5 minutes, and maximal bronchodilation usually
occurs within 15 minutes.30 (Reference) Therefore, to achieve maximal
effect during intense exercise, short-acting beta agonists should be
administered 15 minutes before exercise. Duration of action varies, but
effectiveness against EIA generally lasts 3 to 6 hours.
   Salmeterol, the long-acting beta agonist approved for use in patients
age 12 or older in the United States, has been shown to protect against EIA
for up to 12 hours in 55% of patients who have EIA and take no chronic
asthma medications.31 (Reference) Because its onset of action is slower
than that of the short-acting beta agonists, salmeterol is never to be used
as a rescue medication, and dosing is limited to 2 puffs every 12 hours.32
(Reference) Patients who take salmeterol, therefore, must have a
short-acting beta agonist available to relieve sudden onset of
bronchospasm.33 (Reference) The effectiveness of short-acting beta agonists
for rescue purposes may be blunted if salmeterol is being used.34
(Reference)
   In addition, tolerance to the effects of beta agonists is an area of
active research. In general, tachyphylaxis appears to occur with regular
use of beta agonists.33,35,36 (Reference) With regard to EIA, a recent
study37 reported that after 4 weeks of regular salmeterol administration,
tachyphylaxis developed to the point that there was no significant
difference in effectiveness between the drug and placebo. The controversy
surrounding the regular use of beta agonists has led to the current
consensus recommendation of on-demand use.24,26,38,39 (Reference)
   Current guidelines for the management of EIA begin with administration
of a short-acting inhaled beta agonist 15 minutes before exercise. Patients
should then undertake a 15-minute warm-up period of stretching and
low-level exercise, followed by a 15-minute rest period before intense
exercise if possible. If asthma symptoms develop during exercise, on-demand
therapy with two puffs of short-acting beta agonist should be repeated.6
(Reference)
   Patients must be carefully educated about the proper use and roles of
short- and long-acting beta agonists. If a patient's use of a short-acting
beta agonist increases, he or she should immediately contact the physician:
Increased use may be a sign of worsening disease, and the patient may need
further evaluation and anti-inflammatory therapy. Patients should also
clearly understand that a long-acting beta agonist is not intended as
rescue medication nor as a replacement for inhaled anti-inflammatory
therapy. Recent reports of deaths attributable to respiratory arrest in
patients using salmeterol40,41 (Reference) emphasize the importance of
patient education and proper use of asthma medication.
   Cromolyn sodium is another frequently used medication for the treatment
of EIA; its anti-inflammatory effects prevent EIA in 70% to 85% of
patients, with a very low incidence of side effects.28 (Reference)
Administered before exercise, it is most effective in patients who have
normal pulmonary function tests. Cromolyn combined with a beta agonist is
highly effective in patients who don't respond to single-medication
therapy. Early- and late-phase asthmatic responses are inhibited by
cromolyn sodium, though its exact mechanism of action in EIA is unknown.
Theories include inhibition of mast cell mediator release and alteration of
calcium influx. Because the duration of action and efficacy of cromolyn
sodium are less than those of the beta agonists, it is generally used as a
second-line agent.7 (Reference) The greatest inhibitory effect of cromolyn
sodium on EIA may occur at much higher doses than provided by two puffs of
the metered dose inhaler.42 (Reference)
   Cromolyn is most effective for EIA when given by inhaler 10 to 45
minutes prior to exercise.43 (Reference) Cromolyn does not have any
bronchodilating action, and if it fails to prevent bronchoconstriction, a
beta agonist inhaler should be used for immediate relief.
   Nedocromil sodium, an inhaled anti-inflammatory agent, has also been
found to inhibit exercise-induced asthma,44,45 (Reference) showing
effectiveness equal to that of cromolyn sodium.46 (Reference) Like
cromolyn, nedocromil is administered before exercise and is most effective
in patients who have normal pulmonary function tests. Nedocromil combined
with a beta agonist is highly effective in patients who don't respond to
single-medication therapy.
   Corticosteroids administered through an inhaler improve asthma symptoms
by reducing airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity. They do not
have any immediate bronchodilator effect and are not effective if used
alone just prior to exercise. Corticosteroids should instead be used as
maintenance therapy to control asthma. Such use can improve the
effectiveness of pre-exercise beta agonists in preventing or decreasing the
severity of EIA.6,47 (Reference) Inhaled dosages of less than 400 g daily
have a low incidence of side effects. When side effects occur, the most
common are oropharyngeal candidiasis and dysphonia; both can be avoided by
using a spacer.28 (Reference)
   Oral theophylline has been widely used in the treatment of asthma for
decades. Its bronchodilating effects are directly related to plasma
concentration, and theophylline may also have some anti-inflammatory
effects.29 (Reference) Theophylline is not a first-line agent in the
prevention and treatment of EIA--it is generally used for patients who do
not respond well to inhaled beta agonists. Theophylline would be a third
choice behind beta agonists and cromolyn for patients under age 12, and
would rank behind beta agonists, cromolyn or nedocromil, and perhaps
ipratropium bromide in those over age 12. Theophylline may be given either
in rapid-release form 1 to 2 hours before exercise or regularly in the
sustained-release form for prophylaxis. Even in rapid-release form,
theophylline's long onset of action (approximately 90 minutes) limits its
use in an athletic setting.29 (Reference) Factors influencing serum
concentration and the possible effect on classroom concentration in
children make theophylline less desirable than other options in most
patients. As with cromolyn sodium, the combination of theophylline and a
beta agonist may be additive in the prevention of EIA,29 (Reference) though
concerns have been raised regarding increased incidence of side effects
when these two agents are used together.7 (Reference)
   Ipratropium bromide is a derivative of atropine and has bronchodilating
effects. The inhaled drug is used in some patients with EIA who are unable
to tolerate or who do not respond well to beta agonists. It may also be
used in combination with beta agonists or cromolyn sodium. If cromolyn or
nedocromil combined with a beta agonist do not adequately control
bronchospasm, a trial of ipratropium bromide would be recommended. The drug
has a slower onset of action than beta agonists, and its use in EIA is
limited: When used alone, the drug is effective in only 30% to 40% of
patients and requires nearly normal baseline pulmonary function to be
effective.7 (Reference) When combined with a beta agonist, ipratropium
bromide may be a helpful adjunct in adults who have moderate-to-severe
asthma. Though some studies have reported effective prophylaxis of EIA with
ipratropium bromide, others have not found it to be effective.48
(Reference)
   Other agents that have been used in the treatment of EIA include
antihistamines and calcium channel blockers. Antihistamines decrease
bronchospasm in some individuals but will not prevent EIA. However, they
can improve nasal function, allowing the patient to breathe better through
his or her nose. The calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil
hydrochloride have been shown to inhibit mast cell mediator release and
prevent symptoms of EIA in a select group of patients;49 (Reference)
however, data are insufficient to recommend them for EIA control.
   Recent studies50,51 report that leukotriene inhibitors and heparin
relieve EIA. The clinical effectiveness and use of these medicines will
become more apparent after further trials.

Removing Breathing Barriers
   From allergies to air temperature, many factors can affect the
bronchospastic response of EIA, and the physician must be aware of the
nuances of each patient's response. Fortunately, there are many
nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options that can be combined to control
nearly any degree of EIA.
   The efforts put into the diagnostic workup, follow-up, and patient
education are rewarding because they enable patients to perform at or near
maximal activity levels.

In brief: When a neck injury is suspected, the on-site physician must first
provide basic trauma care, which includes establishing an airway as
necessary, assessing breathing, and checking circulation and neurologic
compromise. A few targeted questions during history taking and a directed
physical exam will help rule out serious cervical injuries, which are
uncommon. More common are minor injuries, such as ``burners.'' Team
physicians must also be well-versed in immobilizing and transporting the
patient, administering a thorough neurologic exam, and establishing when
the athlete can return to competition.

Of the 6,000 to 10,000 spinal cord injuries reported each year, motor
vehicle accidents account for 35% to 45%, and falls for 25% to 30%.1
(Reference) Most of the rest are related to sports, especially football,
rugby, ice hockey, soccer, diving, gymnastics, and wrestling.2-4
(Reference) Nevertheless, catastrophic neck injuries are infrequent in
sports, with a prevalence of less than 2/100,000 neck injuries.3
(Reference) One sport has especially reduced the incidence: Fewer than 10
football players each year have sustained permanent injury to the cervical
spinal cord since 1977.5 (Reference)
   Less serious sports-related neck injuries, in contrast, are fairly
common. Moreover, it is often difficult to differentiate a stable neck
injury from an unstable one, so physicians must be proficient in assessing
and managing all neck injuries. Three priorities must be considered in the
emergency medical management of a patient with a spinal cord injury: (1)
ensure patient survival, (2) preserve spinal cord function, and (3) allow
the highest possible chance for an injured spinal cord to recover.

On-Field Evaluation
   First, do no harm! Do not move the patient except from immediate danger
or for basic trauma management. An estimated 50% of neurologic deficits are
created after the initial traumatic insult.6,7 (Reference) Furthermore, it
is difficult to determine immediately if a neck injury is stable or
unstable.
   If the athlete has fallen on the field, have him or her lie there until
a brief initial evaluation is completed (figure 1). An unstable neck injury
must be assumed in the following instances: an unconscious athlete, an
awake athlete who has numbness and paralysis, and a neurologically intact
athlete who has neck pain or pain with neck movement.
   When a neck injury is suspected, institute the ABCDEs of trauma care
(airway, breathing, circulation and cervical spine, disability, and
exposing an injury for evaluation). Here is a modified version that can be
used for possible neck trauma.
   Trauma care basics. Airway management is of primary importance. The jaw
thrust technique has been shown to be the safest method for opening the
airway in patients with suspected neck injury.8 (Reference) In this
technique, the caregiver places his or her fingers behind the angle of both
sides of the patient's jaw and lifts up, bringing the mandible forward. If
this technique is inadequate, the modified jaw thrust-head tilt, in which
the jaw is pulled upward and the head tilted back as little as possible,
can be used.
   In a football player with a suspected neck injury, do not remove the
helmet initially because the jostling may cause severe neurologic
complications if the patient has an unstable fracture. If an airway access
is necessary, the face mask may be cut using a sharp knife or a device
called a Trainer's Angel (Trainer's Angel, Riverside, California). Trained
personnel can remove a face mask in less than 30 seconds using a Trainer's
Angel.
   Breathing problems in a patient with a neck injury may signal more
severe injury. For example, apnea may mean that the patient has sustained
damage to the brain stem. Once the airway is secure, artificial respiration
may be necessary.
   In assessing circulation, first check for a carotid pulse. If it is
absent, begin chest compressions in accordance with basic life support
guidelines. It is important to remember that spinal shock can cause
hypotension, paradoxical bradycardia, and warm, dry skin. However, consider
all causes of shock in an athlete who might have multiple fractures. A
tension pneumothorax, especially in tall, thin athletes, may also cause
hypotension with paradoxical bradycardia.
   It is also important to gauge cervical tenderness by palpating the
spinal processes for tenderness and the paraspinal musculature for
tenderness and spasm.
   To evaluate disabilities, it is important to perform a motor and sensory
assessment (table 1). This can also be done on the sideline. Clinically,
there are two classes of spinal cord injury: complete and incomplete.
Complete injury renders the patient without motor power or sensation below
the level of injury. Incomplete injury leaves the patient with some
preserved motor or sensory function. Although rare, a complete injury
results in a poor outcome in almost all cases. Spinal shock may appear to
be a complete lesion; however, it usually resolves within 24 hours.9
(Reference)
   Finally, if a serious injury is visually obscured, it may be necessary
to expose the area by removing clothing or equipment without moving the
patient.
   History. If the patient is alert, the history is at least as important
as the physical exam. History taking can be included during initial trauma
management or be done immediately afterward. How the athlete responds to
questions can help in further assessing the level of consciousness. If he
or she can respond verbally without any problems, chances are the airway is
patent. Important questions to ask are:

    -- How did the injury happen?
    -- Are you having any weakness, numbness, or tingling?
    -- Are you feeling any pain?
    -- Does it hurt to move your neck?
    -- Have you had a neck injury before?
    -- Do you think you can go back into the game?

   Most sources agree that severe neck injury is usually accompanied by
pain and sometimes neurologic symptoms.10-13 (Reference) An athlete without
pain and neurologic symptoms has a very low probability of having a severe
neck injury and therefore can be helped off the field for further
evaluation. A patient with neck pain should have his or her cervical spine
immobilized and be placed on a backboard for transport to the sideline en
route to an emergency facility.

Transportation to the Sideline
   It is essential that proper equipment be available for transporting the
patient from the field safely. If the clinical picture is unknown, it is
best to treat all neck injuries as unstable by immobilizing the neck. If a
cervical collar is available, apply it until a cervical-spine injury is
ruled out.14 (Reference) A backboard is necessary to prevent further injury
while moving the athlete (figure 2). Once the athlete is on the backboard,
immobilize his or her head and torso. Use sandbags or other padding to
sandwich the head as it is taped to the backboard (figure 3). Ammonia or
smelling salts should be avoided in the dazed or unconscious athlete
because a reaction of jerking away from this stimulus may cause neurologic
compromise.

Off-the-Field Management
   Further assessment and initial treatment can be initiated once the
patient is on the sideline. If there is time, patients on backboards can be
assessed while waiting for emergency transportation.
   When an unstable injury is possible, it is important to determine the
nature and severity of the injury and have the patient further evaluated at
an appropriate medical facility. Stable cervical sprains and strains, in
contrast, rarely require extensive treatment and generally resolve without
incident. All possible neck injuries, however, require a thorough
neurologic examination off the field.
   The sideline neurologic exam includes a quick assessment of motor,
sensory, and reflex pathways. Have the patient move his or her fingers and
toes. Assess grip strength by having the athlete squeeze your fingers with
each hand simultaneously; be alert for asymmetry. Look for asymmetry when
the athlete dorsiflexes and plantar flexes his or her feet. Check for gross
sensation in the upper extremities by simultaneously touching similar parts
of each arm. If the situation allows, check for reflexes and for asymmetry
of reflexes.
   Also, assess the cranial nerves. Nerves II through XII should be quickly
assessed in all patients who have acute neck injuries. This evaluates brain
stem function. Finally, active range of motion (ROM) should be included so
that the patient can stop if the movement becomes painful. A patient who is
asymptomatic and has full ROM can usually return to play.
   The most common neurologic cervical injury is a unilateral neurapraxia
of the cervical nerve roots and brachial plexus, often called a ``burner.''
Key historical features of this condition are quick recovery from the
resulting paresthesia or weakness in the extremities, accompanied by full
ROM without pain. Return to activity is permitted when the paresthesia has
subsided and full muscle strength and full, pain-free ROM have
returned.15,16 (Reference) Neurapraxias that are multiple or bilateral may
warrant further diagnostic workup. If this is an athlete's first
neurapraxia or if the condition involves the lower extremities, he or she
needs a full workup and should not return to play.

Be Prepared
   The best way to handle cervical spine injuries is to be prepared for
them. It is important to have a game plan, with all equipment inspected and
readily accessible, and all personnel involved trained to use it.
Communication among all members of the emergency medical team should be
established before the competition. Transportation to an emergency medical
facility should be immediately available as well. Proper preparation can go
a long way in avoiding serious long-term sequelae.

Figure: 2. To move an athlete to a backboard, a person should be assigned
to the injured athlete's head to hold it in a neutral position (a). Three
other helpers--one each at the shoulders, hips, and legs--assist in rolling
the athlete onto his or her side (b) as the board is slid underneath the
athlete by a fifth helper. The person assigned to the head should lead the
maneuver.

Figure: 3. When securing a patient's head onto a backboard, the idea is to
immobilize the neck in relation to the rest of the spine and not to fasten
only the neck to the backboard. Therefore, place a sandbag or rolled towel
on either side of the head. Tape the head and sandbags to the backboard
with at least one piece of tape across the forehead and one piece across
the chin. Also, fasten down the trunk.

EXERCISING--OR NOT--WHEN YOU ARE SICK

By:
William A. Primos, Jr, MD, with James R. Wappes

   You're not feeling great. You have a sore throat, stuffy head, and runny
nose. But you feel like you could maybe log a few road miles. Should you?
   Whether you're a low-key exerciser or a competitive athlete, knowing
when to work out if you don't feel well can be difficult. When you have an
infection such as a cold, ``stomach flu,'' or contagious skin condition,
you (and, often, your doctor) need to decide how exercise might affect your
health, your performance, and the health of others. Of course, it's also
good to avoid infection in the first place.

Should You Play On?
   The first question to ask your infected body is if you need to push it.
When your body is fighting an infection, your performance and fitness
benefits will likely be less than optimal, so why bother? Missing a few
days of training is not the end of the world--and it may even be a better
option. And if you're a competitive athlete, taking yourself out may be the
best thing for the team.
   Sometimes, though, physical activity helps you feel better. For example,
working out can sometimes temporarily clear a stuffed-up head when you have
a cold.
   So if you think exercise might help, or if you can't bear to miss a
workout, do a ``neck check'' of your symptoms.1 (Reference) If your
symptoms are located ``above the neck''--a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing,
or a sore throat, for example--then exercise is probably safe. But start at
half speed. If you feel better after 10 minutes, you can increase your
speed and finish the workout or game. If you feel miserable, though, stop.
   On the other hand, your ``neck check'' may reveal ``below-the-neck''
symptoms. Avoid intense physical activity if you have any of these
symptoms: muscle aches, hacking cough, fever of 100 degrees F or higher,
chills, diarrhea, or vomiting. Exercising when you have below-the-neck
symptoms may mean, at best, that you'll feel weak and dehydrated. Worse,
you may risk such dangerous conditions as heatstroke (dangerously high body
temperature) and heart failure.
   You can resume exercising when ``below-the-neck'' symptoms subside.
However, when recovering from an illness that prevented you from working
out, it's important to ease back into activity gradually. A good rule of
thumb is to exercise for 2 days at a lower-than-normal intensity for each
day you were sick.

Stop the Spread
   If you're on a team, an additional concern is whether you will infect
others. And if you're healthy, you may wonder about someone else infecting
you. For common illnesses like the cold, practice commonsense hygiene like
washing your hands frequently and directing coughs and sneezes away from
others.
   Some infections, though, are readily spread in sports and require
athletes to be sidelined while they are contagious. Two such conditions are
measles and herpes simplex (a virus that often causes cold sores or
blisters and is transmitted via skin-to-skin contact, as in wrestling). If
you may have such an infection, see a doctor for treatment and information
about when to resume sports.
   Other conditions can also spread readily. So in addition to regular
hygiene, athletes need to refrain from sharing water bottles and towels.
Infections have been known to pass to other athletes via both routes.
   You should also be properly immunized against diseases such as measles,
mumps, tetanus, and rubella. Also, some athletes may benefit from an
influenza vaccine. Ask your doctor what immunizations you need.

Common Cold, Common Sense
   As is often true, deciding to exercise when you are sick largely
involves common sense. Taking precautions about spreading infection and
listening to your body can go a long way in getting you back into action
without serious problems.

   Remember: This information is not intended as a substitute for medical
advice. If you have concerns about your health, consult a physician.

AN IRREGULAR PULSE IN A SKYDIVER

By:
John D. Cantwell, MD

   A 29-year-old man was referred to a cardiologist after an irregular
heartbeat was found on a preemployment physical examination. He had no
cardiac or pulmonary symptoms.
   Past illness or surgery included only several operations for ocular
strabismus. He took no medications. His weekly alcohol intake included six
beers, two shots of hard liquor, and six or seven glasses of wine. He
averaged one-fourth pack of cigarettes per day over the past 9 months, but
had not smoked previously.
   His exercise habits included skydiving (two to five jumps per weekend),
running 6 miles three times per week, and lifting weights for 1 hour two to
three times per week. His father was hypertensive. There was no family
history of early coronary disease, arrhythmia, or sudden death. The systems
review indicated a single syncopal episode 6 years earlier while lifting
weights after having donated blood.
   On physical examination the patient's blood pressure was 115/82 mm Hg,
and his pulse was 54 per minute and irregular. Neck and chest evaluations
were normal. The heart was not enlarged. A grade 1/6 short systolic
ejection murmur was heard at the upper and midleft sternal border, and
diminished with Valsalva's maneuver and with standing. His first heart
sound quieted progressively on an intermittent basis in cycles of three or
four. The complete blood count and biochemical profile were normal. His
total cholesterol level was 135 mg/dL and his HDL was 45 mg/dL.
   His resting electrocardiogram (ECG) is shown in figure 1. His Bruce
protocol treadmill test was normal; he had a duration of 16 minutes,
stopping because of fatigue.

   Why did his first heart sound soften progressively and cyclically? Based
on your interpretation and diagnosis, do you think he should be hired for a
demanding job that involves a certain amount of emotional stress?

Diagnosis
   The resting ECG shows 5:4 Wenckebach second-degree atrioventricular (AV)
block (figure 2). The loudness of the first heart sound is inversely
related to the length of the PR interval on the resting ECG. A longer PR
interval allows the AV valves more time to drift closer to the closed
position, resulting in a softer sound. The exercise ECG is normal (figure
3); the PR intervals usually become regular as the athlete exercises.

Discussion
   In 1906, the noted Dutch physician Karel Frederik Wenckebach first
reported periodic prolongation of the PR interval with dropped ventricular
beats.1 (Reference) Wenckebach had previously discovered that extrasystoles
were seen in healthy individuals as well as in those with cardiac disease.
   Wenckebach AV block (also referred to as Mobitz type I AV block) can be
normal in a highly-trained athletic person such as this patient. It is
probably related to an increase in resting vagal tone and subsides during
the stress of exercise when blood catecholamine levels rise.
   We advised the company that the young man was healthy and recommended
that he be hired. We added that his maximum oxygen uptake was 54.7
mL/kg/min, placing him in the high fitness category for men his age.

NONTRAUMATIC HIP PAIN IN ACTIVE CHILDREN
A Critical Differential

By:
Lynda F. Gerberg, MD; Lyle J. Micheli, MD
Pediatrics Series Editors: Barry Goldberg, MD, and Elliott B. Hershman, MD

   In brief: A case report of an 8-year-old baseball player who was
diagnosed with Legg-Calve-Perthes (LCP) disease gives an opportunity to
consider the many nontraumatic causes of hip pain. Possibilities include
slipped capital femoral epiphysis, septic arthritis, transient synovitis,
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and bone tumor. Radiographs and bone scans
are used to document and stage LCP, and to evaluate the effectiveness of
treatment. Though the aggressiveness of treatment depends on the disease
stage, the treatment of choice is generally nonsurgical containment of the
femoral epiphysis with a cast or orthosis.

   When an active young person presents with a limp and hip pain, an injury
should of course be considered; however, it is also important to think
about the many nontraumatic entities with similar presentations.
   Our case report of a patient who had Legg-Calve-Perthes (LCP) disease
(avascular necrosis of the femoral head) demonstrates the importance of a
thorough exam and referral when necessary.

Case Report
   An 8-year-old Little League baseball player presented with a history of
intermittent pain in his left hip over the past 6 months. It had begun
gradually and was initially most noticeable during baseball practice.
Crutches and activity restriction, prescribed after a recent exacerbation,
had provided no relief, and he was referred to our orthopedic sports
medicine clinic.
   There was no history of acute trauma. He had been experiencing pain with
all activities. He had no history of illness.
   On physical exam, the patient walked with an antalgic limp. He otherwise
appeared to be in good health with appropriate height and weight for his
age. He was afebrile. There were no gross deformities in his legs or hips
and no differences in temperature or girth between the limbs. He had marked
discomfort to palpation over the entire left hip region. Internal rotation
and hip abduction caused significant pain. When compared with the opposite
side, decreases were noted in hip range of motion in abduction, internal
rotation, and flexion.
   A full laboratory work-up included complete blood count, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and Lyme
titer. There were no significant findings. Plain radiographs demonstrated a
``moth-eaten'' radiolucency suggestive of osteopenia of the femoral
epiphysis and neck (figure 1a). The femoral epiphysis was shortened. A bone
scan (figure 1b) demonstrated evidence of avascularity of the left femoral
epiphysis consistent with LCP disease.
   The patient was placed in a Petrie spica cast with the hip in 30 degree
abduction and 30 degree internal rotation. A follow-up x-ray (figure 1c)
demonstrated proper containment of the femoral epiphysis within the
acetabulum.
   The patient was pain free 2 weeks after cast application. After cast
removal at 6 weeks, physical therapy was instituted to restore full range
of motion and strength to the hip, and three-point partial weight bearing
was begun. Anteroposterior and frog lateral radiographs taken after 1 month
of physical therapy demonstrated continued containment and no fragmentation
of the femoral epiphysis. The patient remained pain free, and hip range of
motion improved. He was sent home on crutches for another 12 weeks after
which crutch use was tapered. Nine months after initial diagnosis he was
taken off crutches completely and was asymptomatic.
   Anteroposterior and frog lateral x-rays taken 1 year after initial
presentation (figure 1d) demonstrated that the femoral epiphysis had
remodeled within the acetabulum with a good spherical shape. Mild sclerotic
changes had not progressed and the joint space was preserved. The patient
returned to sports without difficulty.

More on Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease
   LCP disease may present between ages 2 and 12; the majority of cases
occur when patients are between 4 and 8 years old. In boys the incidence is
1:750; in girls it is 1:3,700.1 (Reference)
   Initially pain free, this condition often presents as a limp after
activity. The limp usually worsens, and eventually the patient may complain
of pain in the hip, groin, inner thigh, or occasionally the knee. Muscle
spasm and synovitis can limit motion, particularly abduction and internal
rotation. Though various triggers of LCP disease have been hypothesized,
including trauma, synovitis, and hypercoagulability, the pathogenesis these
hold in common is interrupted blood supply of the growing femoral
epiphysis.2 (Reference)
   The natural history of LCP disease occurs in the following stages:
   (1) Edema develops at the synovial membrane and capsule over 1 to 6
weeks.
   (2) Necrosis of the femoral epiphysis occurs, and can last from several
months to 1 year.
   (3) Regeneration/resorption lasts 1 to 3 years. Granulation tissue
invades the necrotic bone, leaving isolated areas of bone sequestered.1
(Reference) Invasion by connective tissues leads to resorption and
replacement by new immature bone. This may result in weakening of
subchondral support.
   (4) Repair occurs when new, normal bone replaces dead bone. The outcome
is related to the percentage of epiphysis involved, the patient's age, and
the promptness of the diagnosis.3 (Reference)
   Catterall3 (Reference) classified LCP disease into four stages based on
radiographic findings of percentage of involvement of the epiphysis (figure
2). Plain radiographs of our patient's hip showed changes that were clearly
consistent with LCP disease (Catterall stage 2); however, further imaging
is indicated if there is a strong suspicion of LCP disease despite normal
plain films. We confirmed our diagnosis with a bone scan, which is highly
accurate once symptoms have presented. New developments in nuclear medicine
such as the pinhole camera and computerized axial techniques allow even
earlier diagnosis of ischemic necrosis.4 (Reference) Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) is extremely effective in detecting early and preclinical or
asymptomatic avascular necrosis, and it localizes and identifies the extent
of the ischemia. Because of cost, MRI should be reserved for early
identification when less expensive tests are negative or inconclusive.4
(Reference)

Other Nontraumatic Hip Disorders
   The differential diagnosis in the work-up of a patient with apparent LCP
disease takes on added significance because one of the
possibilities--slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)--is an orthopedic
emergency and requires immediate referral. Several other hip disorders
resemble LCP disease.
   Slipped capital femoral epiphysis. SCFE is the most common nontraumatic
hip problem in adolescents, and its presentation is similar to that of LCP
disease. In SCFE, the epiphyseal plate weakens during rapid growth. The
stress of the patient's body weight disrupts the attachment of the femoral
neck and the femoral epiphysis, with the femoral neck moving upward and
forward on the femoral epiphysis.
   Clinically, patients who have SFCE are either obese or tall and thin.
The condition usually occurs in children who are slightly older (11 to 16
years) than those who have LCP disease. The physical presentation is
similar, but the pain is usually worse. The patient is unable to touch the
abdomen with the thigh because the hip externally rotates with flexion.
Radiologic studies help differentiate SCFE from other hip disorders. It
must be kept in mind that SCFE is an emergency, and requires
non-weight-bearing treatment as soon as it is diagnosed.5 (Reference)
   Septic arthritis. In our patient, septic arthritis was quickly ruled
out. He appeared healthy, with no fever or other clinical or laboratory
signs of sepsis, and the physical exam of his hip did not correlate with
the picture of a septic joint.
   Though septic arthritis is seen in all age groups, it is most common in
infants and children ages 1 to 2 years. Patients often have a history of
recent injury or infection such as otitis media. The usually acute onset of
septic arthritis is accompanied by fever, apprehension, and loss of
appetite. The joint is warm, swollen, and held in flexion. Active and
passive range of motion are limited by extreme pain. Physical and
laboratory signs of sepsis should prompt quick referral for immediate
aspiration of the joint under appropriate conditions.
   Transient synovitis. Transient synovitis can resemble LCP disease;
however, the patient may have a history of a recent upper-respiratory
infection and may have a slight fever, usually no higher than 100 degrees F
(37.7 degrees C) to 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C). Transient synovitis is
the most common cause of hip pain in children under age 10. Patients
present with pain in the anteromedial aspect of the thigh and knee and walk
with a limp. Motion is limited, and a flexion contracture of the hip may be
present. Hematologic tests are negative with no signs of sepsis. On
radiographs, capsular bulging is evident; no changes in bone are seen,
which helps rule out avascular necrosis. Transient synovitis is a
self-limited benign condition. Weight-bearing is limited, and radiographs
are repeated in 2 to 3 months to rule out LCP disease, which may develop
after an episode of transient synovitis.
   Rheumatoid arthritis. The hip is the third most common joint to be
involved in pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Children with
pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis do not present with systemic
systems. The insidious onset is accompanied by swelling, stiffness, and
minimal pain on motion. Effusion is palpable, and soft-tissue and bony
changes are seen on radiographs.
   Tumors. Tumors involving the hip joint must also be kept in mind. The
physical exam and radiographic studies will help detect or rule out a bone
tumor.

Restoring Hip Function
   LCP disease requires individualized treatment; factors include age at
onset, change in range of motion, stage of the disease, and Catterall
group. Age at onset is a significant prognostic factor--results are
significantly better in younger children. Therefore, early diagnosis is the
most important factor in preventing long-term complications. The main
treatment objectives are to relieve muscle spasm, regain range of motion,
and contain the femoral epiphysis within the acetabulum to minimize
deformation of the femoral head.
   Historically, there have been four methods of treatment:1 (Reference)
observation, bed rest, nonsurgical containment with ambulation, and
surgical containment. Currently, observation is chosen only when the
patient has no decreased range of motion and meets Catterall's stage I
criteria. The child is allowed to continue with regular activities of daily
living. Bed rest is rarely used today because it requires lengthy
hospitalization.2 (Reference) However, bed rest with hip abduction has
shown satisfactory results in 70% to 80% of patients.1 (Reference)
   If surgery is required, the goals are the same as for nonsurgical
treatment: to regain adequate range of motion, minimize deformity, and
relieve muscle spasm.5 (Reference) The femoral head is repositioned via
femoral osteotomy or the acetabulum repositioned via pelvic innominate
osteotomy. The goal is to place the femoral epiphysis deep within the
acetabulum, therefore preventing or minimizing deformation. Surgery should
be reserved for patients who have or are progressing to femoral head
deformity, but who cannot or will not accept orthoses.
   The current treatment of choice is ambulatory management with
nonsurgical containment of the femoral epiphysis. This method has been used
with extremely favorable results.6 (Reference) and allows the child to
continue most activities of daily living. Good results have been observed
in 60% to 70% of patients. Without containment, the femoral epiphysis may
become deformed and extrude from the acetabulum during the
revascularization stage of LCP disease, particularly if the hip is allowed
to maintain adduction and external rotation. Placing the femoral epiphysis
within the acetabulum and maintaining abduction and internal rotation
reduces forces on the epiphysis, allowing it to remodel properly.
   Methods of ambulatory containment include the Petrie spica cast and
removable devices such as the Newington A-frame orthosis, the Scottish Rite
abduction orthosis,7 (Reference) and the Toronto brace. It has been our
experience that ambulatory casting gives excellent results along with good
compliance by the patients and their families.
   Long-term prognosis. Long-term outcomes are good in the majority of
patients.1,2,5 (Reference) Approximately 9.5%, however, develop
deteriorating symptoms and degenerative arthritis in late adolescence and
early adulthood. The development of degenerative arthritis is not related
to sports participation after initial treatment.5 (Reference) These
patients often require surgery before age 35. Studies5 (Reference) have
shown that the abduction extension osteotomy yields the best results,
relieving pain, improving range of motion, and correcting any leg length
discrepancies.

A Full Return to Activity
   Early recognition and intervention can help patients with LCP disease
avoid deformity and disability that might otherwise lead to lifelong
impairment of activity. Indeed, the long-term prognosis for complete
recovery and sports participation after treatment is excellent, and most
patients can return to activity without restrictions.

Illustration(s):
Figure: 1. An anteroposterior radiograph (a) of the pelvis of an 8-year-old
boy who presented with left hip pain demonstrates shortening of the left
femoral epiphysis (bracketed area) caused by trabecular fracture.
Irregularity of the bony contours of the femoral epiphysis is also noted
(arrow), along with fullness about the left hip suggestive of an effusion.
``Moth-eaten'' radiolucencies (arrowheads) suggest osteopenia of the
femoral epiphysis and neck. On a bone scan of the patient's left femoral
epiphysis (b), decreased uptake is consistent with the avascular necrosis
of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (arrow). Films taken shortly after Petrie
casting (c) indicate proper containment of the femoral head within the
acetabulum. The legs have been placed in 30 degrees of abduction and 30
degrees of internal rotation bilaterally. Note the presence of mild
flattening of the left femoral epiphysis (arrow). A follow-up frog lateral
view (d) taken 1 year after treatment with a Petrie spica cast demonstrates
proper joint space preservation. The left femoral epiphysis remains well
seated within the acetabulum. Mild flattening and sclerosis (arrows) show
no further progression.

Figure: 2. Catterall classified Legg-Calve-Perthes disease into four
stages. In stage 1, necrosis is present at the anterior aspect of the
femoral head as noted by the dotted areas. Lysis is present, but there is
no bony sequestration. In stage 2, bony sequestration is present as noted
by the central areas of radiopacity. A medial and lateral column of normal
bone protects the central area from collapse. In stage 3, extensive bony
sequestration diminishes support and increases the chance of residual
deformity. Metaphyseal cyst formation is noted by the line-slashed areas.
In stage 4, total involvement produces significant residual deformity shown
by the jagged areas that indicate sclerosis and decreased size of the
femoral head.

GOING ONLINE: SPORTS MEDICINE AND MORE

By:
Ann Harste, Minneapolis
psm@mill2.millcomm.com

   You say you don't have time to search online for lively sports medicine
debate and helpful medical resources. But you have Internet access at the
clinic or at home, and you find yourself craving some high-tech
professional connectedness. How you access the different areas of the
Internet will depend on the type of connection you have, but once you're
on-line, here's a quick tour of the Net to get you started.
   World Wide Web. A good starting point on the Web is Yahoo
(http://www.yahoo.com), a hip and definitive directory of some of the best
sites indexed by subject. Yahoo offers hundreds of links under the health
category. Another site is the highly acclaimed Virtual Hospital
(http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/), a digital health sciences library
administered by the University of Iowa. You'll find patient simulations,
journals, clinical practice guidelines, multimedia textbooks, and teaching
files.
   To get a quick handle on the medical journals and newsletters available
online, visit MedWeb: Electronic Newsletters and Journals
(http://www.cc.emory.edu/WHSCL/medweb.ejs.html), a directory that provides
many direct links to journals' tables of contents and, in some cases,
abstracts and full-text articles.
   Medical Matrix: Guide to Internet Clinical Medicine Resources
(http://www.kumc.edu:80/mmatrix/) is a project of the American Medical
Informatics Association's Internet Working Group. In addition to being rich
in links to other sites, Medical Matrix provides an overview of existing
Internet medical resources and news on resources in development.
   Finding epidemiologic information is a whole lot easier now that the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a Web site for the Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report (http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/mmwr.html). The
site features full-text retrieval, and users can search past issues by
topic--no more thumbing through that prolific stack of skinny reports. The
National Library of Medicine's HyperDOC Home Page (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/)
is the place to go for links to the institution's vast collection of
clinical resources.
   A must-visit stop on your Web rounds is Dr Bil's Cool Medical Site of
the Week (http://www.hooked.net/users/wcd/cmsotw.html). William C. Donlon,
DDS, exhaustively searches the Web's medical sites and crowns his pick of
the week. Visitors are also asked to submit their suggestions.
   Gopher servers. Even though the Web is getting the lion's share of the
attention these days, there are also many valuable resources on Gopher
servers. The University of Southern California offers links to
medicine-related Gopher servers all over the world. Their Gopher address is
cwis.usc.edu; once connected, select: Other Gophers and Information
Resources/Gopher-Jewels/Health, Medical, and Disability/Medical
Related/Medical Related (misc).
   News groups. News groups are discussion groups devoted to specific
topics; they are similar to bulletin board systems found on commercial
online services or private dial-up services. There are hundreds of topics
to choose from. To get a thumbnail sketch of what other physicians are
doing with their technology tools, consider browsing through
sci.med.telemedicine. It's a convenient source of medical software reviews,
an announcement board for other online medical resources, and a sounding
board for physicians' experiences with clinical information systems.
   E-mail lists. Like news groups, electronic mailing lists provide an
exchange of information among users interested in a particular topic.
Subscribers receive the discussion directly to their e-mailbox through
e-mail postings from other members of the group. The American Medical
Society for Sports Medicine's AMSSMNet is available to its members and
other interested parties. To subscribe, AMSSM members can send an e-mail
message to listserv@msu.edu. In the first line of the body of your message
type: SUBSCRIBE AMSSMNet Your Name. Nonmembers can request e-mail
information about joining AMSSMNet from Dave Jenkinson, DO, at
13460DJ@msu.edu or Randy Pearson, MD, at 13460RP@msu.edu.
   The ATHTRN-L e-mail list contains topics in sports medicine along with
discussions on the roles and certification of athletic trainers. To
subscribe, send an e-mail to listserv@iubvm.ucs.indiana.edu . In the first
line of the body of your message type: Subscribe ATHTRN-L Your Name.
   A vital source for family medicine practitioners is Fam-Med, an e-mail
list that focuses on use of computer and telecommunication technology in
the teaching and practice of family medicine. Fam-Med also offers a
resource area that includes access to file archives, a Gopher server, and a
Web index. The resource area and instructions for subscribing to the

RELIEF FOR EXERCISE INCONTINENCE

By:
Carol Potera, Great Falls, Montana


   Stress incontinence often puts a damper on a woman's resolve to
exercise. Up to a third of women--even young, conditioned
athletes--experience stress incontinence.1 (Reference) Treatment options
have included tampons, pessaries, diaphragms, and, for severe cases,
surgery. The bladder neck support prosthesis (BNSP) is a new option.
   A study1 (Reference) on the effectiveness of two incontinence
options--tampons and pessaries--recently came out in favor of tampons. The
researchers found that 8 of 14 women with mild incontinence (less than 15 g
of urine loss) remained dry while wearing a tampon during aerobic exercise,
while a standard pessary kept only 5 of 14 women dry. Urine loss was
measured by weighing an absorbent pad before and after exercise.
   The tampon is worn during exercise or other activities that produce
stress incontinence, says Ingrid Nygaard, MD, the study's author and
assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the
University of Iowa College of Medicine in Iowa City. Tampons have no side
effects when worn for less than a day, she says. Nygaard advises patients
to moisten the tip of the tampon with water beforehand to make insertion
and removal more comfortable.
   Most women, and even some gynecologists, have never heard of pessaries,
Nygaard says. There are many types of pessaries: The ones specifically
designed to treat stress incontinence resemble a diaphragm but have a
protrusion on the ring that helps elevate the urethra, thus blocking urine
leakage. When worn only for short periods of time during activities that
produce incontinence, pessaries produce no side effects and do not
decondition pelvic floor muscles, Nygaard says.
   A new vaginal device designed especially for active women debuted in
October. The flexible, ring-shaped BNSP has two blunt prongs on one end
that laterally support the urethra. The BNSP (Johnson and Johnson Medical,
Inc, Arlington, Texas) rests on the pelvic floor muscles and reinforces
their function during exercise. ``This is the same thing we accomplish with
surgery,'' says urogynecologist Willy Davila, MD, of the Colorado
Gynecology and Continence Center in Denver. When tested on runners, hikers,
and other active women, the BNSP kept 24 of 30 patients dry; 6 were
improved but still had mild incontinence.2 (Reference) Benefits were
greatest in those who had severe incontinence. All participants rated the
device satisfactory.
   To provide a custom fit, BNSPs come in 25 sizes, varying in ring size
and prong length. The BNSP appears to be relatively free of side effects,
says Davila. One patient in the study developed a bladder infection;
however, he says bladder infections are not unusual in patients who have
stress incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle deconditioning is not an issue,
Davila says. In fact, he says muscle function seems to improve: Pelvic
floor contractions during activity are partially responsible for the
device's support function.
   Physicians can routinely help women open up about their problems with
incontinence by telling patients that many active women notice urine
leakage while exercising, says Nygaard. Advising women about simple,
nonsurgical treatments such as tampons, pessaries, and pelvic floor
exercises can minimize incontinence and keep women exercising, she says.
   A traditional pessary costs about $50, and the BNSP costs about $300,
says Nygaard. Some active women report that the BNSP is more comfortable
than the traditional pessary, says Davila. ``The BNSP fits in loosely and
is designed to be dynamic; it moves with the woman,'' he says. ``A
traditional pessary fits in tightly and supports prolapsed tissues.''
However, Nygaard says many of her patients who are runners have been
satisfied with comfort of traditional pessaries.

EXPEDITE ANKLE EVALUATION

By:
Aaron Rubin, MD, Fontana, California

   When making return-to-play decisions for players who have just injured
their ankles, a good screening test if you're busy on the sidelines is to
ask them to squat. If they are unable to squat because of pain or have
difficulty rising, they are probably unable to resume play.

IMPROVE YOUR GOLF GRIP

By:
Ty Wadsworth, MD, St Louis

   A new exercise to develop grip strength was developed by Dale Boggs, a
golf professional who was recovering from an upper-extremity injury. The
exercise requires an old telephone book. To begin, open the phone book with
the binding facing away. The fingertips should be slightly moist. With one
hand use pressure from the fingertips to rip, crumple, then discard the
first page from the phone book. Repeat the exercise until fatigued,
typically 15 to 30 pages for the dominant hand and 10 to 20 pages for the
nondominant hand. The page numbers can be used to keep up with repetitions,
which are increased over time.
   This exercise is useful for increasing grip strength and endurance,
wrist flexor strength, and fine motor control. It is useful for injury
rehabilitation and for performance enhancement because it promotes a firm,
relaxed grip throughout the golf swing.

EARLY ASTHMA DETECTION

By:
William W. Dexter, MD, Lebanon, New Hampshire

   Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) presentation can be subtle, especially in
children. Parental reports of a child lagging on the playground or seeming
unduly fatigued after competition warrant further investigation: These can
be signs of EIA, even if the child is not coughing or wheezing.

ESTABLISHING TEAM CONFIDENCES

By:
David Garner, PhD, Bowling Green, Ohio

   As a clinical psychologist in Toledo and an adjunct professor of
psychology at Bowling Green State University, I've worked with teams that
have players with eating disorders. I've found that it's useful to build an
independent relationship with the team--one that is not connected to the
coach. This may enable team members to open up to you and be more honest.
At the same time, I discourage enlisting the help of players to identify
eating disorders in teammates. This practice only serves to establish an
atmosphere of paranoia on the team.

WOUND CARE FOR AQUATIC ACTIVITIES

By:
Stephen Fuzie, PT, ATC, Pittsburgh

   In water sports such as water polo, there are times when an athlete
needs to wear a bandage to prevent bleeding or to cover stitches. Regular
athletic tape loses adherence in the water and presents a target for
opposing players. Covering a flesh-colored bandage with clear Tegaderm
transparent dressing with label (3M Corp, St Paul) or a similar product
will keep the wound dry and prevent bleeding. The thinness of the material
minimizes the edge so that the bandage can't be easily removed by friction
or contact. This bandaging technique is also helpful when athletes sweat
heavily.

STRENGTHENING THE HIP ABDUCTORS

By:
Michael Ross, MSEd, PT

   Many common exercises, like partial squats, involve movement mainly to
the front and back. Such exercises are good conditioners for activities
like bicycling and using stair machines and treadmills, which primarily
require back-and-forth motion. But most sports and many daily activities
require side-to-side motion. To prepare your body for a variety of
stresses, you need to build strength for those motions, too.
   The muscles most responsible for sideways leg motion are the hip
abductors on the sides of your hips. These muscles help move your legs out
and away from each other. They play a large role in steadying forward
movements, not to mention their importance in sports like tennis and golf
that require a lot of side-to-side motion or stability. Including
hip-abductor strengthening in your exercise regimen will help with daily
activities and sports and will lower your injury risk. These strengtheners
are especially good for people who have had hip or low-back pain.
   The exercises in figures 1 through 3 help strengthen your hip abductors.
These exercises are simple and don't take much time, so you can easily fit
them into your training.
   For each exercise, build up to three sets of 20 repetitions, 3 to 4 days
per week, if possible. Go slowly, and rest only long enough between sets to
let your muscles recover from the slight burning sensation they will
experience. As the exercises become easier over time, you can add ankle
weights in 1- to 2-lb increments as long you have no pain.

   Remember: This information is not intended as a substitute for medical
treatment. Before starting an exercise program, consult a physician.

Illustration(s):
Figure: 1. To do the sideways leg raise, lie on your side. Flex the muscles
on the outside of your thigh and lift your leg 12 to 15 inches while
keeping your back still. Hold for 3 to 5 seconds. Repeat with the other
leg.

Figure: 2. For the hip hiker, stand with one foot on a stable 4- to 6-inch
object (a). Slowly raise yourself by straightening the upper knee and hip
(b). Hold for 3 to 5 seconds, then slowly lower the foot back to the floor.
If you find it hard to balance, stand in front of a sink or table and place
your hands on it for support. Repeat on the other side.

Figure: 3. Start the squat and slide by standing. Slightly bend one knee as
you slide the opposite foot to the side as far as is comfortable without
bending that leg. Hold for 3 to 5 seconds, then return. Repeat with the
other leg. For better balance, place your hands on a sink or table.

ACCIDENTAL HYPOTHERMIA: WHEN THERMOREGULATION IS OVERWHELMED

By:
Teofilo L. Lee-Chiong Jr, MDJohn T. Stitt, PhD

Preview
   The homeless, the elderly, infants, military personnel on duty, and even
persons living in subtropical climes may fall prey to the effects of
hypothermia. Most cold-related injuries and fatalities are due to
accidental exposure, ingestion of alcohol and other intoxicants,
hypoglycemia, trauma, or chronic debilitating illness. The authors explain
the effects of heat loss on body systems and discuss how to reverse the
process and achieve rapid rewarming.

   Like other homeothermic animals, humans are able to maintain their body
temperature within narrow limits regardless of normal changes in
environmental conditions. Nonetheless, hypothermia, which is defined as
body core temperature below 35 degrees C (95 degrees F), can develop
whenever this remarkable thermoregulatory apparatus is overwhelmed by
excessive heat loss, inadequate heat production, or impairment of
function.

Epidemiology
   Over 9,300 deaths from hypothermia were reported in the United States
between 1979 and 1990.1 (Reference) Most cases occur in urban areas, and
the elderly, the indigent, and the homeless are often affected. For
example, one half of cold-related fatalities in the District of Columbia
between 1972 and 1982 occurred in persons with inadequate housing.2
(Reference) The highest number of deaths from hypothermia occurred not only
in states with severe winters, such as Illinois, New York, and
Pennsylvania, but also in states with milder weather, such as North and
South Carolina and Virginia.3 (Reference) The incidence of hypothermia is
equally alarming in other countries. In a Danish hospital from 1975 to
1989, hypothermia was documented in nearly 5% of patients admitted to the
intensive care unit.4 (Reference)
   Cold-related deaths and injuries are also often reported in combatants
during military campaigns and in participants in outdoor winter sports.
About 91,000 cases of cold injury were reported among US soldiers in Europe
during World War II.5 (Reference)
   Hypothermia may develop in persons exposed to a modestly cool climate
for prolonged periods. The condition has even been reported in tropical
climates where average daily temperatures do not fall below 16 degrees C
(60.8 degrees F).6 (Reference) However, most cases of ``tropical''
hypothermia have involved patients with severe undernutrition or
malnutrition.

Predisposing factors
   The principal predisposing factors in cases of hypothermia are
accidental cold exposure, immersion in water, extremes of age, trauma, drug
ingestion, poisoning, and chronic illness. Hypothermia due to accidental
cold exposure is encountered most commonly among neonates and the elderly,
in those immobilized by trauma or exhaustion, and in intoxicated and
unconscious persons.

   Extremes of age--In neo-nates, large surface area relative to body mass,
lack of subcutaneous fatty tissue, rudimentary adaptive behavior, and
ineffective shivering all contribute to inability to defend against extreme
environmental conditions. In the elderly, altered thermal perception,
deteriorating adaptive responses, low body-fat content, autonomic
dysfunction, maintenance on medications, impaired vasoconstrictive ability,
and low metabolic capacity are common factors that contribute to
hypothermia.
   Trauma--Exposure to cold at the scene of an accident, during lengthy
surgery, or as a result of inadvertent transfusion of large amounts of
unwarmed crystalloid solutions and chilled blood components increases the
risk for hypothermia in trauma patients. Furthermore, heat production from
shivering is inhibited by anesthetics and neuromuscular blocking agents.
Abnormal peripheral vasodilatation and dermal damage produced by surface
burns may produce large, unchecked heat losses from the body surface.
   Drug ingestion and poisoning--The possibility of recreational and
therapeutic drug ingestion must be considered in any unexplained case of
hypothermia. Depending on the population surveyed, consumption of ethanol
is associated with up to 80% of hypothermia cases.7 (Reference)
Phenothiazines may produce hypothermia through a hypothalamic depressant
action and an inhibitory effect on shivering. Drug overdoses and poisonings
can disrupt normal heat production and conservation by impairing perception
of changes in ambient temperature (which may result in inappropriate and
often paradoxical behavioral responses) and depressing the mental status.
   Chronic illness--Antecedent chronic debilitating illnesses, such as
severe hypothyroidism, hypothalamic tumors, overwhelming infections, severe
strokes, and malnutrition, not only exacerbate hypothermic injuries but
also decrease the victim's capacity to counter hypothermia once it has
developed.

Manifestations
   During early, mild hypothermia, the body attempts to compensate for its
falling temperature by intensifying thermogenesis through shivering and
hypermetabolism. A generalized increase in heat production by the
musculature surrounding the torso is associated with shivering. In the
extremities, shivering is less pronounced or absent. Accompanying the
increase in metabolism are (1) elevations in respiratory rate, minute
ventilation, and oxygen consumption, (2) increases in heart rate, cardiac
output, and mean arterial pressure, and (3) elevated levels of serum
cortisol, lactate, glycerol, ketones, and glucose; all of these result in
increased heat production. Acrocyanosis and cool skin reflect the intense
peripheral vasoconstriction that helps sustain core temperature by shunting
blood away from the cold body surface.
   Thermoregulatory failure--Thermoregulation eventually fails when peak
heat production is unable to offset the rate of heat loss from the body
surface; further reductions in core temperature occur, eventually leading
to progressive multiorgan dysfunction (table 1). Because of reductions in
cerebral blood flow, patients may become uncooperative and uncoordinated
and may even manifest irrational behavior, such as undressing. Confusion
and stupor emerge at temperatures between 32 degrees C and 35 degrees C
(89.6 degrees F and 95 degrees F). Most patients are comatose at 27 degrees
C (80.6 degrees F).
   Pulmonary and renal effects--Depression of the central respiratory
center can cause both tidal volumes and respiratory rates to decline.
Cold-induced vasoconstriction increases central blood volume; this increase
promotes withdrawal of antidiuretic hormone, which leads to the familiar
cold-induced diuresis. Furthermore, in cases of hypothermia, cold-related
impairment of renal enzymatic activity can inhibit active tubular
reabsorption, resulting in marked excretion of extremely dilute urine,
which, in turn, may further compound preexisting hypovolemia and
hemoconcentration. Renal failure secondary to depressed renal blood flow
and defective tubular activity often develops in patients who have
prolonged and profound hypothermia.
   Gastrointestinal effects--Diminished intestinal motility is commonly
observed at core temperatures below 34 degrees C (93.2 degrees F), and
ileus is invariably present once body temperature falls below 30 degrees C
(86 degrees F). In addition, acute punctate erosions of the stomach and
duodenum, hepatic dysfunction, and pancreatitis may develop as a result of
hypoperfusion.
   Cardiovascular effects--Cardiac output and mean arterial pressure fall
as a result of bradycardia, hypovolemia, and decreased ejection fraction.
Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias often develop as hypothermia progresses.
Atrial fibrillation becomes common below 32 degrees C, and ventricular
fibrillation and asystole may occur if core temperature falls below 28
degrees C (82.4 degrees F) and 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), respectively.
When body temperature drops below 31 degrees C (87.8 degrees F), a
characteristic electrocardiographic change called the Osborne wave (J wave)
is seen; it manifests as a deflection at the QRS and ST junction and is
best visualized in leads II and V (subscript) 6.
   Reduced metabolic demands--The widespread physiologic derangements of
hypothermia would be immediately fatal were it not for the concomitant
reduction in metabolic demands caused by body cooling. Vasoconstriction and
hemoconcentration ensure acceptable arterial pressures in spite of reduced
cardiac indexes. As a result of reduced metabolic requirements, even the
progressively falling respiratory minute ventilation remains adequate to
meet the demands of oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide elimination. Oxygen
consumption falls by 25% at a core temperature of 31 degrees C and by 75%
at a core temperature of 20 degrees C. Depression of cerebral metabolism
enables the brain to tolerate most hypothermic insults, and complete
recovery of neurologic functions has been reported despite prolonged
cardiac arrest and resuscitation.8 (Reference)

Treatment
   One of the most difficult tasks confronting physicians who treat
patients with hypothermia is accurate determination of death. Rigor mortis,
dependent lividity, and fixed, dilated pupils--all of which are commonly
associated with death in normothermic individuals--become unreliable
indicators in the presence of hypothermia. Therefore, resuscitative
measures must be terminated only when cardiac arrest persists despite
rewarming.
   Preventing further heat loss--It is imperative that further heat loss be
halted by moving patients to a warmer environment. They must be kept dry
and insulated. Hot drinks and particularly alcohol are best avoided because
they can magnify ongoing heat loss by promoting inappropriate peripheral
vasodilatation.
   Laboratory studies--Laboratory values obtained at presentation not only
serve as a useful baseline for future determinations but also may
facilitate early recognition of emerging complications. In addition to
blood counts, serum chemistry values, and coagulation parameters, it is
advisable to obtain a thyroid panel, measurements of serum cortisol and
cardiac isoenzymes, and surveillance cultures and chest radiographs. Blood
glucose levels are notoriously unpredictable and must be closely monitored,
especially in cases of hypoglycemia, which may impede rewarming if left
uncorrected. Films of the cervical spine are essential whenever coexisting
head and neck trauma is a possibility. Repeated abdominal and pelvic
radiographs and determinations of serum amylase and lipase levels may be
necessary to monitor pancreatic and intestinal injuries.
   While awaiting results of toxicologic studies, physicians may consider
empirical administration of naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan) and thiamine
hydrochloride (Biamine) in patients who are known to have a history of
illicit drug and alcohol abuse. Levothyroxine sodium is indicated only for
hypothermic myxedema and methylprednisolone (A-Methapred, Solu-Medrol) only
for adrenocortical insufficiency.
   Cardiac monitoring--This is essential for assessment of arrhythmias.
Faint peripheral pulses can be extremely difficult to appreciate because of
bradycardia and intense vasoconstriction. Atrial arrhythmias and heart
blocks are usually transient phenomena that convert spontaneously with
rewarming. Bretylium tosylate (Bretylol) is the drug of choice for
ventricular fibrillation and appears to be more efficacious than lidocaine
hydrochloride (Xylocaine). Bradyarrhythmias may require temporary pacing.
Aggressive rewarming is mandatory with arrest rhythms, because
pharmacologic and electrical cardioversions are invariably unsuccessful
when body temperature is below 30 degrees C. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
must be continued until the victim's core temperature has reached 32
degrees C to 35 degrees C.
   Maintenance of intravascular volume--Adequate intravascular volume needs
to be supported. Early initiation of intravenous access facilitates
parenteral administration of pharmacologic agents as well as infusion of
crystalloid solutions and various blood components. In the presence of
frostbitten extremities, central venous access may be preferable to
peripheral catheters. Furthermore, central venous lines allow large-volume
infusions, which may not be possible peripherally with cold-induced
vascular constriction; central lines also permit monitoring of central
venous pressure during fluid replenishment.
   Because the hypothermic myocardium is intensely irritable, the tip of a
central catheter must be located at a reasonable distance from the heart to
prevent induction of arrhythmias. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring using
pulmonary catheters may precipitate fatal arrhythmias.
   Preferably, 5% dextrose in normal saline solution should be heated to 40
degrees C to 42 degrees C (104 degrees F to 107.6 degrees F) before
administration. Lactated Ringer's solution is best avoided because the
liver's capacity to metabolize lactate to bicarbonate is often inhibited by
hypothermia. Low doses of dopamine hydrochloride (Dopastat, Intropin) may
be required if hypotension persists despite seemingly adequate fluid
repletion. Because of their inherent arrhythmogenic capacity, levarterenol
(Levophed), epinephrine, and isoproterenol hydrochloride (Isuprel) are
rarely, if ever, indicated. Hourly urinary output should be monitored by
using indwelling bladder catheters.
   Airway control--Satisfactory airway control must be guaranteed.
Administration of warm, humidified oxygen by face mask suffices for most
cases of mild hypothermia. Endotracheal intubation is primarily indicated
during respiratory arrest and whenever adequate protection of the airways
is questionable. Control of secretions is particularly troublesome in
persons with moderate to severe hypothermia, because profuse bronchorrhea
and ineffective mucociliary activity may contribute to airway obstruction.
   Infection--This ever-present hazard requires diagnostic vigilance and
vigorous therapy. Infection is easily missed because fever is often absent
and laboratory findings are invariably nonspecific. At times, an
unexplained fall in systemic vascular resistance is the sole clue to
evolving sepsis. Use of prophylactic antibiotics is indicated in neonates
and infants and also in diabetic adults, in whom the prognosis with sepsis
is particularly ominous.
   Thromboembolism--Hypothermic patients may be prone to thromboembolism
because of cold-related intravascular volume depletion and increased blood
viscosity. Unfortunately, traditional measures are often unsatisfactory in
preventing this complication. Cutaneous hypoperfusion renders the
absorption of subcutaneously administered heparin highly erratic.
Application of pneumatic boots may further compromise frostbitten
extremities.
   Dermal injury--Dermal injury from frostbite typically affects the
extremities, face, ears, penis, and scrotum. Initially gray and waxy, the
involved areas usually become swollen and blistered and may turn red to
black with rewarming. Frostbitten dermis may be thawed by bathing in water
that has been warmed to 38 degrees C to 40 degrees C (100.4 degrees F to
104 degrees F). Parenteral heparin has been used to salvage injured
tissues. Surgical excision and amputation must be deferred until definite
demarcation of nonviable dermis becomes apparent during the second week
after injury.

Methods of rewarming
   Rewarming should be achieved rapidly at the most hemodynamically
tolerable rate possible with use of the least invasive means (table 2). A
particular rewarming method, whether passive or active, is selected after
thorough consideration of the patient's age and overall health, the
presence of any concurrent complications, the severity and duration of the
hypothermic insult, and the effectiveness and degree of invasiveness of
available techniques.
   Passive external rewarming--This is the least invasive method of
rewarming and is generally sufficient for patients with core temperatures
above 33 degrees C (91.4 degrees F). Minimizing further heat dissipation by
removing the patient from the cold environment and providing shelter and
insulation is often all that is necessary for acute, mild hypothermia when
endogenous heat production through shivering restores body temperature to
acceptable levels. With this method, temperature can increase by 0.4 degree
C to 2 degrees C (0.7 degree F to 3.6 degrees F) each hour. Peripheral
vasoconstriction is maintained; this minimizes the risk of both hypotension
and temperature afterdrops, which often occur when cold peripheral blood is
shunted to the core during vasodilatation.
   Active rewarming--This method is indicated for patients with moderate to
severe hypothermia and core temperatures below 32 degrees C. It may also be
preferable in the elderly and in patients with hypoglycemia,
hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypopituitarism, or other disorders
that limit endogenous thermogenesis. Persons with diabetic ketoacidosis and
cardiovascular instability may benefit from the rapid normalization of core
body temperature that is possible only with active rewarming. Finally,
active rewarming must be considered in any patient, whatever the degree of
hypothermia, if initial passive rewarming methods fail to elevate body
temperature.
   Active external rewarming--This may be accomplished with hot water
bottles, heated blankets, external radiant sources, or warm bath
immersions.9-11 (Reference) These approaches are highly effective in
elevating body temperature but do have several drawbacks. In addition to
dangerous surface burns, which may occur if the temperature of the thermal
appliance is not closely monitored, afterdrops of core temperature may
develop because these methods tend to induce early peripheral
vasodilatation. Hemodynamic instability may ensue if the hypothermic heart
is unable to respond adequately to the rising metabolic requirements of the
rewarmed exterior tissue shell. The risk of circulatory collapse is
determined primarily by the patient's degree of cardiovascular tolerance,
the extent of exposed body surface, and the intensity of rewarming.
   Active core rewarming--This provides the most rapid return to
normothermia and is the method of choice in patients who have cardiac
arrest or ventricular fibrillation. Airway rewarming is done with warmed,
humidified gas, and rewarming rates between 1 degree C and 2.5 degrees C
(1.8 degrees F and 4.5 degrees F) an hour can be achieved. This method has
the added benefits of (1) preferential rewarming of central blood volume
and the heart and lungs and (2) stimulation of the airway mucociliary
apparatus. Inhaled gas temperatures should be maintained between 40 degrees
C and 45 degrees C (104 degrees F and 113 degrees F) by using an in-line
temperature monitor to prevent tracheobronchial injuries and parenchymal
edema, which may occur if gas temperatures exceed 46 degrees C (114.8
degrees F).
   Lavage of the gastrointestinal tract can be done with warmed solutions.
However, the effectiveness of intragastric irrigation is limited by the
small surface area of the stomach, and fluid and electrolyte shifts may
complicate intracolonic irrigation. Lavage is contraindicated in persons
with suspected intra-abdominal trauma and in those who have had recent
gastrointestinal surgery.
   Pleural irrigation is performed either through thoracostomy tubes or
with open thoracotomy. Circulating warm saline solution can also be
introduced into the mediastinum through chest tubes. Similarly, peritoneal
lavage with prewarmed dialysate can be accomplished by peritoneal dialysis
or by direct irrigation of the open peritoneal cavity if hypothermia
develops as a complication of abdominal surgery. Peritoneal dialysis is
contraindicated in patients with abdominal injuries and is preferably
avoided in those who have had previous operations, because they may be more
prone to intraperitoneal injury and infection from preexisting adhesions.
Like intracolonic lavage, peritoneal dialysis may promote detoxification of
ingested drugs and poisons by rewarming the liver and reactivating hepatic
enzymes.
   Extracorporeal rewarming of blood by cardiopulmonary bypass or
hemodialysis should be considered for severely hypothermic patients with
core temperatures below 28 degrees C. Blood circulation can be preserved by
using cardiopulmonary bypass even in the absence of effective myocardial
activity. The rate of rewarming averages 9.5 degrees C (17.1 degrees F) an
hour during cardiopulmonary bypass.12 (Reference)

Prognosis
   Survival is inversely related to the intensity and duration of
hypothermia. Outcome is better in cases resulting from simple exposure or
ingestion of ethanol. Significant antecedent illness, cardiac arrest before
hospitalization, hypotension, coma, respiratory failure, and intravascular
thrombosis indicate a worse prognosis.

Summary
   The diagnosis of hypothermia must be entertained when patients present
with unexplained mental status changes or arrhythmias. Prompt recognition
and aggressive treatment of complications should reduce cold-related
fatalities. The choice of an appropriate rewarming method must be
individualized and depends on the severity of hypothermia and the patient's
degree of hemodynamic tolerance.

THE COST OF CARING: WHO HEALS THE HEALER?

By:
Peter A. Setness, MD

   The cost of medicine. We hear about it constantly, usually in connection
with terms such as ``skyrocketing,'' ``spiraling,'' and ``out of control.''
But at a 25-year reunion of a family practice residency program I attended
recently, the discussion centered on a different type of medical cost--the
personal cost of being a primary care physician.
   A large group of current faculty and residents, as well as returning
graduates, spent a Saturday morning listening to a panel discussion and
then, in smaller groups, sharing some of their own stories. These
physicians, from rural solo practices, urban multispecialty group
practices, and everything in between, talked not only of their great
satisfaction in sharing in the personal and family events in the lives of
their patients, but also of the loneliness in dealing with medical crises
and other problems faced by patients they had come to know as friends. Most
of them spoke of a lack of emotional support from the community and,
unfortunately, a lack of overt support from colleagues when they were
dealing with a poor patient outcome, a malpractice suit, or personal
problems.

Key rewards
   I'd like to believe that physicians in primary care medicine have some
personal values that enable us to reach out to patients and that these very
connections, in turn, reward us. There is an important difference between
being a doctor and being a personal doctor, one who is willing to make a
commitment of person to the patients he or she serves. This commitment is
what allows us to turn a case into a patient and a number into a name--of a
real person in a real family in a real community. It gives our medical
encounters depth, but it also puts us at some emotional risk.
   The relationships we develop with patients are the key rewards in our
practice. They are what keeps us coming back for more. Often we have the
privilege of caring for a patient through many years or even through the
patient's life span. The flip side, though, is the emotional burden of
foreseeing the medical problems that lie ahead for a patient. The joys of
the doctor-patient relationship are tempered when a patient is dying or
when we feel we or the medical community could have done something better.

Punishing ourselves
   When a patient's outcome is poor, we punish ourselves by second-guessing
our decisions. But when a result is less than optimum, perhaps no one is to
blame. As Rabbi H. Kushner says in his well-known book, bad things do
happen to good people. We may be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Despite our competence and conscientious surveillance, some patients may
experience side effects of medications or procedures. As financial
considerations become more important in medical care, managed care
guidelines or policies may distort our particular style of medical
practice. We may pay too much attention to cost containment, thus
increasing the potential for a poor outcome.
   Instead of personalizing poor results and internalizing the discomfort,
we need to remind ourselves that the situation may have been beyond our
control. One long-time physician in my discussion group shared the pain of
not diagnosing a carcinoma until it became metastatic in a patient who had
just recently come in for an annual exam. The physician felt personally
responsible for that patient's cancer and had grieved silently for years.
Unfortunately, his family, his friends, and even his other patients also
suffered because of his unresolved grief, damaged self-esteem, and mild
depression.
   Such self-doubts can get way out of hand: According to the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, physicians are No. 3 out of
230 occupations analyzed for risk of suicide, with an odds ratio of 2.88
compared with the general public. Only psychologists and pharmacists rank
higher, and lawyers hold the fifth spot.
   A poor outcome is not necessarily the same as a mistake. As Mark Twain
is quoted as saying, ``Good judgment comes from experience, and experience
comes from poor judgment.'' Reviewing events retrospectively, with all the
advantages of hindsight, can be healthy. But it is easy to focus on a
particular outcome and to forget about the confusion and complexities that
surrounded the case in context. We are accountable for what we try to do,
but not for everything that happens.

Sharing our feelings
   We also need to remember that we cannot protect ourselves or others from
the personal pain of living. Sometimes all we can do is try to ease
someone's pain. But because we feel we need to be strong, we tend not to
show our feelings. And when bad things happen, we blame ourselves too
easily. We might feel such guilt that we dread seeing a patient or won't
even call the patient's family. The point is, it's okay to say ``I'm
sorry.'' It's not an admission of guilt. And by sharing your feelings with
your patients and their families, you become a personal doctor.
   Like everyone else, physicians have to deal with personal
problems--family illnesses and deaths, financial concerns, chemical
dependency, divorce, disabilities, and the whole range of human frailty.
Physicians who are struggling with such problems need tremendous support.
The stress of silence can be almost unbearable, and not talking about our
feelings contributes to a sense of isolation and hopelessness. Doctors are
usually better at analyzing and evaluating facts, function, and form than
at dealing with their own frustrations and feelings and their need to
forgive and to be forgiven.

A listening ear
   The physicians at the reunion shared their difficulty in coping with
their personal pain within their practice setting. In one case, the least
likely colleague initiated a healing discussion, while a best-friend
physician would not or could not discuss the topic with the distressed
physician. It's almost as if some physicians cannot talk about painful
issues. Perhaps they think that the emotional feelings surrounding poor
outcomes, malpractice cases, and personal pain are contagious. But, at
least in the case of problems related to practice, support from colleagues
who not only can understand the confidential nature of a poor outcome or
the legal implications of a malpractice threat, but also can identify with
our vulnerability, is invaluable. We need our colleagues, with common
experience, to become trusted listeners.
   Support can also come from other sources. One doctor in the discussion
group said that a unique, long-time patient-friend turned out to be his
greatest source of support time and again. The important thing is to find a
nonjudgmental listener who, by hearing and reflecting on our story, can
help us understand our experience better. Sometimes all a patient needs is
for us to listen. At times, a good listener may be all that we need too.

Reaching out for help
   So who heals the healer? How do we talk, and how do we find trusted
listeners? How do we deal with our burdens?
   Look to your colleagues and friends. And perhaps consider a group, but
don't call it a support group. Instead, call it a professional development
group, or a case study seminar, or a journal club, and devote the last part
of the discussion time to patient and personal issues. The group could be a
model of the now-classic Balint seminar, where one confronts oneself by
discussing case-centered, patient-centered issues. What often happens in
such discussions is that the ``doctor'' in the doctor-patient relationship
emerges as you talk about a patient's problems, and soon you are talking
about your own place in the relationship and your own needs as a doctor.
   If discussion groups aren't your cup of tea or if you are in an isolated
rural solo practice, consider e-mail with other physicians. You might find
that the distance adds a measure of safety and comfort when sharing
personal issues. But be careful of confidentiality issues when discussing
cases on e-mail. The point is, reach out for help. If you don't know where
to turn, call a trusted faculty member at your local residency program or
contact a medical school or your state or county medical society. If you
are in severe distress, consider professional therapy.
   Finally, don't forget to celebrate the everyday joys and successes of
practicing medicine. We have all helped patients through difficult times.
Let's start reminding each other of the successes we have had. And let's be
a constructive force in helping colleagues to cope during difficult times.
The need for help is not a sign of weakness. Don't let the burdens of
caring hide the rewards of practicing medicine.

What is the Balint method of training?
   Michael Balint was a psychiatrist who, with his wife Enid, conducted a
series of training seminars for general practitioners at the Tavistock
Clinic in London during the late 1950s and 1960s. He published the
monograph The Doctor, His Patient, and the Illness after several of his
groups had been meeting for at least 3 years.
   The design of the ``training cum research'' was extremely simple: Small
groups of family physicians met weekly to discuss their interactions with
patients that were in any way puzzling, frustrating, or unsatisfying.
Presentations were informal and spontaneous, and the groups dealt with the
cases over time to understand more about the doctor-patient relationship
and how it affected the quality and outcome of care.
   After Dr Balint taught in the United States in the late 1960s, his
training techniques were widely adopted, especially in family practice
training programs around the country. Today, the International Balint
Federation continues to adapt and use his methods. Information about the

TWO BY TWO

By:
Eric G. Anderson, MD

   I often see geriatric patients as Noah saw his passengers: two by two.
Many of my older patients bring their spouses with them to the office.
   Sometimes these couples make me laugh and brighten my day. I've learned,
however, to bite my lip on occasion and not to laugh too soon, because
sometimes the humor is inadvertent.
   This was the case with Mrs Angel,* who brought her husband in on a day
when he was being particularly difficult.
   ``Do you know why I married this man?'' she finally asked me.
   I shook my head cautiously.
   ``Because there were things about him that I knew would bother other
people that didn't bother me,'' she replied.
   I sometimes learn more from the couple than I would seeing each person
separately. But just as often in my interactions with pairs, I blow it.
   That's what happened with Mrs Teitelbaum,* a new patient who
unexpectedly volunteered that she had divorced her first husband. Her
current husband shrank back uncomfortably into one of my office chairs.
   ``Well, I'm sure Mr Teitelbaum is better looking,'' I said
encouragingly, smiling at the embarrassed man.
   ``No,'' she said, brushing some lint off her skirt. ``My first husband
was better looking.''
I blundered on. ``Yes, but I bet your mother prefers Mr Teitelbaum.''
   ``No. She prefers my second husband,'' she replied. ``He's my third.''
   Silence really is golden.
   Not so funny was my relationship with Mrs Freedman.* She insisted on
giving her husband's history, even though he was an intelligent retired
schoolteacher who was very much on the ball. She corrected any symptoms he
offered. It was hard, therefore, to get the patient's perspective--not an
uncommon problem when one spouse is dominant, yet a situation experienced
physicians learn to handle.
   I must have forgotten my experience, because at one point in the office
visit I said, probably in exasperation, ``Mrs Freedman, please let your
husband explain how he's feeling. Then we can see if you agree with what
he's said.''
   I caught a strange look on her face, a look I saw again later when I
made my only appearance in court to defend myself against a charge of
medical malpractice. The charge was preposterous and I won, but it took 3
years of my life and a lot of the joy out of practicing medicine.
   The malpractice charge surely sharpened my sensitivity to any patient's
spouse, but I still smile when I think about two situations in which I was
slow to tune in.
   Mrs Schlott* brought in her oversedated husband, who sat drooling in the
corner while she told me what had happened: She'd taken him to our urgent
care department, and a doctor there had diagnosed depression and prescribed
trazodone. The doctor hadn't mentioned the drug's side effects, though. Mrs
Schlott wondered if her husband's headache, nausea, and palpitations could
be related to the medication.
   I wasn't surprised by her questions. The husband, a deaf, irascible
person who never showed his wife affection, used various doctors for
primary care. She often asked me to sort out any confusion regarding his
treatment.
   I looked at the label and noted that a heavy loading dose had been
prescribed for a man his age. I thought I should warn him about the more
important side effects.
   I leaned over and shouted in his ear, dropping my voice when I came to
priapism, a complication I'd actually seen in a couple of patients. I
didn't want to embarrass his wife.
   ``What exactly are you saying, Doctor?'' she asked.
   ``The male might have an erection that could last for hours, Mrs
Schlott. It can be a problem if it doesn't go down,'' I said hesitatingly.
   She led her husband out the door, saying, ``Well, I don't think we'll
worry about a little bit of nausea and headache, will we, Fritz? This
medicine is helping you.''
   Mrs Firenze* had the opposite situation.
   Her debonair Italian husband, aged 93, sported a silk cravat, pearl
tiepin, and a polyester leisure suit. He wanted his ``marital rights''
twice daily.
   His younger wife was exhausted.
   At a number of visits, the old man asked, ``Don't you think my wife
should consider her husband's physical needs?''
She responded with frantic semaphore signals behind his back that showed
she didn't share his sexual appetite.
   Mr Firenze had severe pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. I don't know
how he had the energy to talk about sex, much less want it so often.
   One day, he came in with arrhythmia. He was lethargic, confused,
vomiting, and dehydrated; he'd had a strangulated inguinal hernia for 2
days. I called for an ambulance, then went back to explain the poor
prognosis to his wife.
   She listened carefully until I felt obliged to say, ``He's a poor risk
for surgery. He might die on the operating table. I wish the hospital was
closer. Even the short ambulance ride could kill him.''
   Bless her heart. She fought hard, trying to compose her face, but she
finally broke out into a lopsided grin.
   ``When we take the ambulance,'' she asked, ``could we go the long
way?''

*Names have been changed.

YOUR `WINDOW' TO THE WORLD'S INFORMATION

By:
Jerry F. Potts, MD

   Consider the paramecium. The little one-celled creature we all remember
from basic biology can be compared to the computer sitting in many a
physician's office, or at least to the way it's used.
   A one-celled organism is capable of simple functions (eg, it is motile
and can feed itself). Similarly, a physician's computer often sits alone,
unconnected to others, and completes simple tasks (eg, generates letters or
tracks accounts) with use of a small-business application.
   But when grouped, both organisms and computers become more complex
entities, capable of functioning at new levels that are stunning in their
diversity and exciting in their potential.

What computers can do
   Right now, the technology is available to bring radiographs directly
from the imaging equipment to the desktop screen and to allow the
radiologist and the clinician at the screen to discuss the radiographs as
they view them simultaneously.
   Right now, the technology is available to transfer the spoken word
directly into text on a word processor. Yes, the ``talking typewriter'' of
science fiction stories is now a science fact. And the ``picture
telephone'' is becoming common in the business world as computers and
telephone equipment merge.
   Right now, the technology is available to check a drug dose as you
prescribe it, to print out a personalized set of instructions for a
patient, and to enter information on that patient into an electronic
record.
   To take advantage of the technology that is already available, not to
mention what is coming up, physicians need to take a wider view of what a
computer can do. Rather than thinking of a computer as a tool with which to
accomplish a task, these days it may be more accurate to think of it as a
``window.'' Through it, physicians can see and choose information that is
available from nearly anywhere. As technology becomes simpler and more
standardized, fear of computers, which is already fading fast, will be
replaced with the confident attitude, ``I know it's there. How can I find
it?'' The dominant role of physicians of the future may well be to find and
interpret the most current information, wherever it resides.

What computer networks can do
   One of the latest trends in the computer world is networking. Experts
call for the eventual connection of virtually all computers. The
ramifications as this concept becomes reality are amazing to consider. Even
small networks (eg, a few computers within one office or clinic that can
communicate with each other) offer more information to physicians than what
is immediately available on a single computer.
   The biggest network of all, known as the Internet, is the driving force
behind a complete transformation of computers--from pieces of individual
equipment to mechanical members of large-group cooperatives. By some
counts, as many as 20 million computers now are connected to this worldwide
network of information. Until quite recently, the Internet was the
exclusive province of universities and military institutions. But as
technology advanced, more and more people started using the Internet to
``talk'' to others all over the world. Soon commercial interests came to
appreciate the ability to reach millions of computer-literate people at
virtually no cost.
   The Internet continues to grow at a tremendous rate. The standard method
of communication among corporations, students and others members of the
academic community, and many professionals throughout the world is
electronic mail passed through the network. Today, an Internet address is
almost as common on a business card as a telephone number.

What all this means to physicians
   Among the abundance of material that is readily available on the
Internet is medical information. Disease-prevention statistics,
medical-image files, reference databases, and many other types of text and
graphics are available with a few keystrokes if you know where to look.
Educational pieces for both physicians and patients are accessible and
useful. For minimal cost, you can view an encyclopedia (including audio and
video clips), and if you really want to, you can even watch a frog
dissection.
   In the near future, computer networking is likely to directly affect
physicians by changing the reimbursement process. Electronic submission of
claims is available and is already being used by the large healthcare
institutions. Almost certainly, electronic filing will become a
requirement, so significant changes will be needed in the business offices
of even small practices.
   Many people feel that they save personal time by using the Internet.
Users can plan trips, purchase tickets and other products, and make banking
transactions. They can also dial in to read the latest news or check up and
comment on legislation that is pending in Congress.
   And there are just-plain-fun aspects of networks. Discussion groups have
been formed around virtually every interest, from the arts to gardening to
tennis. Whatever your passion may be, you can chat about it with fellow
enthusiasts across the globe.
   My aim in coming columns is to look at a number of issues related to
computers and the Internet. I'll tell you about ways I've incorporated
computers into my practice and about some of the things ``out there'' that
are on my agenda to try. What's on your computer agenda? I'll be interested
to hear your stories and opinions, and we may share some of them in future
columns (with your permission, of course).
   It becomes more and more obvious the longer I work with computers and
networks that there are no limits to their practical applications in daily
life, especially since they are becoming easier and easier to use. Already,
daughter Elizabeth (aged 20 months) is displaying a tendency to monopolize
the home computer. Can her own e-mail address be far behind?
   Your comments and discoveries about using computers in practice and for
fun are welcome and may be published in Digital Doc. Contact Jerry F.

MEET JERRY POTTS

By:
Peter A. Setness, MD, Editor-in-Chief

   Computer poker! Teletype Star Trek! Thus began Jerry's noble and
altruistic interest in computers.
   But that was only high school and college stuff. During his residency
training in the early 1980s at Hayes Army Hospital, Fort Ord, California,
he attended a patient-wellness fair where the big drawing card was a fairly
new idea at the time--a computer printout of each person's results. With
hundreds of people awaiting their printout, the Radio Shack TRS-80 computer
locked up. To the great relief of the organizers, Jerry was able to get
things going again. As is the Army's way, it rewarded Jerry the Army
Service Medal for his act of selfless heroism. He is probably one of only a
few physicians to be decorated for computer work above and beyond the call
of duty.
   And once again he has fearlessly stepped forward, this time by
volunteering to write a column on computer use by busy practicing
physicians. Jerry is certainly one of those. He has been with the Family
Practice Department at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis since
1986 and is the department's assistant chief and a faculty member of the
residency training program. He is medical director of the Family Medical
Center, sees patients nearly every day, and in his spare time is working on
a prototype electronic medical record-keeping system for the clinic.
   In the limited remainder of his time, he has agreed to give us his
perspective on becoming a ``digital doc.'' Although he has a Mac IIcx at
home, a Pentium 90 at work, and an Apple IIe that he still uses regularly
for word processing (plus a Tandy model 100 in the closet), he really is a
physician first. His interest in computers is self-generated, and he uses
this interest at work to explore ways to facilitate and improve patient
care. This column will be a travelogue of Jerry's explorations--what works
for him and what doesn't.

MODERATE PARKINSON'S DISEASE: STRATEGIES FOR MAXIMIZING TREATMENT

By:
Paul M. Silverstein, MD


Preview
   Levodopa has long been the standard pharmacologic agent for treatment of
Parkinson's disease, but after long-term use of the drug, motor
fluctuations and dyskinesia occur in many patients. In this article, Dr
Silverstein discusses dosage adjustments, combination drug regimens, and
dietary changes that help to optimize symptomatic therapy. He also explores
the neuroprotective potential of selegiline in slowing progression of
Parkinson's disease.

   Parkinson's disease is a relentlessly progressive neurologic disorder
that affects primarily the elderly. Symptoms of the disease are sometimes
initially attributed to the aging process, but one or more of the cardinal
symptoms of parkinsonism--bradykinesia, a characteristic resting tremor,
postural instability, impaired gait and mobility, and limb rigidity--are
often clinically apparent. A number of other symptoms are less common
(table 1).
   Symptoms and rate of disease progression vary greatly among patients.
Once the diagnosis is established, the degree of functional impairment
dictates whether or not drug therapy is initiated. With the help of current
therapies, some patients continue working or lead a relatively normal life
for 10 years or more. But this was not always the case. According to a
study from 1967,1 (Reference) about two thirds of patients were severely
disabled 5 years after onset of the disease; more than 80% were severely
disabled or dead 10 years after onset. The rate of expected mortality has
decreased markedly since 1967, when physicians began to use levodopa
(Dopar, Larodopa)--the precursor to dopamine hydrochloride--for treatment
of Parkinson's disease.2 (Reference)
   Today, there are many options for pharmacologic management of
Parkinson's disease (table 2). This article summarizes a number of the most
current strategies for treating patients with moderate disease and
functional impairment.

What causes Parkinson's disease?
   The exact cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but theories abound.
Although a link has not definitely been established, excessive free radical
formation and oxidative damage to the cells of the substantia nigra
probably play a role in development of the disease.3 (Reference)
   The pathology of Parkinson's disease is well defined: Intracytoplasmic
inclusions, progressive destruction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal
pathway, and consequent reduction of striatal concentration of dopamine are
characteristic.4 (Reference) Postmortem studies have revealed an 80% loss
of dopamine in the striatum at the time symptoms become clinically
apparent.5 (Reference) A deficiency of dopamine, which functions as a
neurotransmitter in the striatum and in other related brain centers,
results in the vast array of physical changes, cognitive dysfunction, and
depressive symptoms that characterize Parkinson's disease.

Slowing disease progression
   Neuroprotective therapy to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease
has become an important focus of treatment strategies recently. The
monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor selegiline hydrochloride
(Eldepryl) may moderate disease progression by reducing toxic free radical
formation, thereby sparing remaining neurons in the substantia nigra.
   Studies involving newly diagnosed cases of Parkinson's disease show that
selegiline slowed the rate of symptom development and delayed the need for
levodopa therapy.6-8 (Reference) Whether this resulted from the drug's
symptomatic effect or from its neuroprotective effect on the neurons of the
substantia nigra remains controversial.9,10 (Reference) Selegiline has the
potential to exert a symptomatic effect because it increases intracellular
dopamine through its inhibition of MAO-B, which blocks the breakdown of
dopamine. Consequently, many clinicians choose selegiline for initial
therapy because of its potential to provide both symptomatic and
neuroprotective benefits.

Symptomatic treatment
   When a patient with Parkinson's disease becomes functionally disabled,
symptomatic treatment is initiated. The choice of the appropriate
pharmacologic intervention is determined by the patient's needs, extent of
disability, symptoms, age, presence or absence of cognitive dysfunction,
and response to initial drug therapy.
   In 1994, a panel of neurologists outlined treatment guidelines for
Parkinson's disease and developed an algorithm that helps maximize response
to drug therapy (figure 1). The algorithm is designed to help physicians
tailor treatment, especially in newly diagnosed cases.
   Currently, drugs used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease include
anticholinergics, amantadine hydrochloride (Symadine, Symmetrel), dopamine
agonists, and levodopa. Each of these agents relies on a different
mechanism of action in the brain and has a well-defined role in the
management of Parkinson's disease.
   Levodopa is currently the most effective treatment, but motor
fluctuations and dyskinesia develop in most patients after long-term
administration of the drug. Current research suggests that this is because
of gradual loss of dopamine terminals in the striatum and changes in the
response of the striatal receptor cells to dopamine.11 (Reference)
   In the normal brain, striatal receptor cells receive a continuous, tonic
stimulation from dopamine via the intact striatonigral pathway. The gradual
loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum diminishes the brain's
ability to continuously produce, store, and release dopamine. In
Parkinson's disease, postsynaptic changes seem to result from the
intermittent stimulation of striatal receptor cells that occurs when
standard levodopa is administered periodically during the day. As the
disease progresses, daily fluctuations in motor capability--ranging from
``wearing-off'' phenomena to sudden, unpredictable changes in mobility,
known as ``on-off'' syndrome--produce increasing disability. Choreiform or
dystonic dyskinesias also develop and are often disabling.
   Other factors thought to influence wearing-off phenomena are the
variability of gastric emptying and factors that influence levodopa
transport. Levodopa is absorbed into the duodenum and then must compete
with large neutral amino acids in the diet for transport across the gut
wall and into the bloodstream; similar competition occurs for transport
across the blood-brain barrier.12 (Reference) Gastric emptying into the
duodenum is delayed by large meals and the use of anticholinergic and
dopaminergic drugs and is a common consequence of advancing age.13
(Reference)

Motor fluctuations
   Management of motor fluctuations is challenging and not always
successful, but a number of strategies are worth trying. Many of these
treatment options share the principal goals of therapy: to sustain
therapeutic brain concentrations of levodopa and provide continuous
stimulation of the striatal receptor cells. These strategies attempt to
control the delivery of levodopa to the brain, modify its breakdown within
the brain, or bypass the presynaptic substantia nigra neuron that is
degenerating and directly stimulate the dopamine receptor.
   Dosage adjustments--Lower and more frequent doses of immediate-release
carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet) throughout the day may help maintain
therapeutic levels in the blood. Providing a dose every 3 to 4 hours during
the day is often beneficial. It is important to give a sufficient amount of
levodopa with each dose to produce an effect; insufficient doses can result
in multiple dose failures during the day.
   Sustained-release preparation--Use of the sustained-release formulation
of carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet CR) prolongs the drug's benefit and helps
avoid wearing-off effects.14 (Reference) This strategy may help to prevent
further alteration in the striatal receptor response by providing a more
physiologic tonic stimulation. When patients change to the
sustained-release preparation, however, the daily levodopa dose must be
increased by 20% to 30% because of differences in bioavailability between
the two preparations. Patients who switch to the sustained-release
formulation often comment that they miss the initial ``kick'' they used to
receive from their first morning dose of regular carbidopa/levodopa. In
such cases, a combination regimen of 1 tablet of the immediate-release form
and 1 tablet of the sustained-release form may be taken as the initial
morning dose. This provides rapid onset of action and a prolonged effect.
   Liquid preparation--For selected patients who are highly compliant and
willing to adhere to a demanding therapeutic schedule, a liquid preparation
of carbidopa/levodopa can be mixed at home to counteract wearing-off
periods.15 (Reference) The standard formula calls for 10 tablets of
carbidopa/levodopa in the 25/100-mg strength and 2 g of ascorbic acid
crystals dissolved in 1 L of tap water. The patient drinks 75 mL of the
solution first thing in the morning and then consumes 35 to 50 mL/hr
thereafter. This preparation works well for many patients who have motor
fluctuations, but a fair amount of fine-tuning is usually required to
establish the correct dose.
   Dopamine agonists--Addition of a dopamine agonist to the
carbidopa/levodopa regimen often results in substantial improvement of
motor fluctuations, because dopamine agonists directly stimulate dopamine
receptors16 (Reference) (figure 2). The two agonists that are currently
available in the United States, bromocriptine mesylate (Parlodel) and
pergolide mesylate (Permax), differ in the way they stimulate the striatal
receptors but have virtually the same effect. A patient who does not
respond to one of the agonists may benefit from the other.
   Daily doses of 15 to 30 mg of bromocriptine generally suffice when the
agonist is added to the carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Doses of 2 to 4 mg of
pergolide per day usually are required to avoid wearing-off effects. When a
dopamine agonist is added to this regimen, the carbidopa/levodopa schedule
is often modified so that smaller, more frequent doses are administered.
For example, a patient taking the 25/250-mg strength of carbidopa/levodopa
three times a day might be switched to the 25/100-mg strength six times per
day. Supplemental dopamine agonist therapy helps smooth out fluctuations.
   Mao-b inhibitors--Use of a selected MAO-B inhibitor, such as selegiline,
may help manage motor fluctuations.17 (Reference) MAO-B inhibitors block
the enzymatic breakdown of dopamine and extend the duration of levodopa
effect. The addition of 5 mg of selegiline twice a day generally requires a
10% to 20% reduction in carbidopa/levodopa to avoid levodopa peak-dose side
effects, such as increased dyskinesia.
   Amantadine also may help some patients. The drug appears to enhance the
release of dopamine, thereby prolonging the amount of ``on'' time that
patients experience.
   Dietary modifications--Large neutral amino acids in the diet can
significantly alter the effect of levodopa by competing with the drug for
transport, primarily across the blood-brain barrier.18 (Reference) Thus, a
meal that is high in protein may diminish the effect of a recent dose of
carbidopa/levodopa. Most patients can avoid this problem by taking their
medication about 30 to 45 minutes before eating. For patients with more
severe fluctuations, a protein-redistribution diet, in which most protein
is consumed in the evening, may be indicated.19 (Reference) Another option
is to consume a balanced carbohydrate-protein diet, for which products are
available commercially. Both of these dietary modifications enhance the
transport of levodopa across the blood-brain barrier and, consequently, at
the dopamine nerve terminals.
   Enteral infusion--In rare cases in which pronounced, disabling
fluctuations cannot be stabilized with other techniques, continuous enteral
infusion of levodopa through a percutaneous gastrojejunal tube may be
warranted.20 (Reference) The challenge is to convince patients of the
benefits of this invasive delivery method.

Dyskinesia
   After 3 years of treatment with levodopa, about half of patients have
dyskinesia.11 (Reference) Muenter and associates21 (Reference) described
dyskinesia as occurring in two patterns: dystonia-improvement-dystonia and
improvement-dystonia-improvement. Treatment is often problematic, but
several strategies may be helpful.
   Peak-dose dyskinesia--The improvement-dystonia-improvement pattern, or
peak-dose dyskinesia, is relatively common. Choreic or dystonic movements
of the head, trunk, limbs and, occasionally, respiratory muscles are
characteristic. Lowering each individual dose of carbidopa/levodopa by a
small amount may help. If motor response deteriorates, a dopamine agonist,
such as bromocriptine or pergolide, may be added. The use of
sustained-release rather than standard carbidopa/levodopa may be beneficial
for this type of dyskinesia because lower peak-dose levodopa blood levels
are achieved. Finally, for patients taking selegiline, discontinuation of
the drug may help reduce dopamine concentrations in the brain.
   Diphasic dyskinesia--The dystonia-improvement-dystonia pattern, or
diphasic dyskinesia, develops with advanced Parkinson's disease and is more
difficult to correct. Abnormal movements are often coarser, associated with
limb pain, and observed when plasma levodopa levels are increasing or
decreasing. This pattern of dyskinesia may respond to more frequent dosing
of carbidopa/levodopa, which helps to achieve a more steady ``on'' state.
Increasing each dose may help, but this approach usually fails over time.
Another strategy is to switch patients with diphasic dyskinesia to an
agonist drug for primary therapy and then supplement the regimen with
smaller doses of carbidopa/levodopa. Use of sustained-release
carbidopa/levodopa may aggravate this pattern of dyskinesia, most likely
because a slower flux of levodopa levels in the blood may contribute to
development rather than treatment of dyskinesias.
   Foot cramps--Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease may have painful
foot cramps in the morning or occasionally late in the afternoon because of
dystonic posturing of the foot. During the cramps, blood levels of levodopa
are critically low. Administration of baclofen (Lioresal),
sustained-release carbidopa/levodopa, or dopamine agonist therapy provides
relief.

Summary
   Motor fluctuations and dyskinesia often develop in patients with
Parkinson's disease after 3 to 5 years of levodopa therapy. Dosage
adjustments, addition of a second medication to the drug regimen, and
dietary modifications may help maximize response to symptomatic therapy.
Given the dramatic variability of symptoms and response to treatment, drug
regimens must be individualized according to the patient's needs.
   In newly diagnosed cases of Parkinson's disease, administration of
selegiline hydrochloride (Eldepryl) may slow symptom development and delay
the need for levodopa therapy. Many physicians prescribe selegiline
initially for its symptomatic and potential neuroprotective benefits.

PNEUMONIA, A FIVE ARTICLE SYMPOSIUM
COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: WHAT'S NEEDED FOR ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS

By:
Thomas M. File Jr, MD

Preview
   Community-acquired pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and
death, particularly in the elderly and in patients with underlying disease.
Identification of a specific cause on clinical grounds often is not
possible, and even extensive studies may not reveal the responsible
pathogen. In this article, the authors concentrate on the factors that
contribute to a reliable diagnosis.

   Several important changes have made diagnosis and management of
community-acquired pneumonia a greater challenge than ever. These include
an expanding number of possible pathogens, increasing antimicrobial
resistance, the influence of HIV infection, and the rising prevalence of
tuberculosis in US communities.1-4 (Reference) There is also a stimulus to
be as cost-effective as possible, and the primary care physician must try
to balance reasonable use of diagnostic tests with empirical therapy. This
review focuses on diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in the context
of these changes.

Clinical diagnosis
   The diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is based on a combination
of clinical and laboratory data. These include characteristic clinical
findings (fever, cough, and rhonchi or rales on auscultation), the presence
of a new infiltrate on chest films, and documentation of a causative
microorganism.
   Although patients with community-acquired pneumonia usually present with
cough and fever, the differential diagnosis is extensive and includes upper
and lower respiratory tract infections as well as noninfectious causes (ie,
reactive airways disease, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary malignancy).
Because most upper respiratory tract infections are of viral origin and are
self-limited, little diagnostic testing or antimicrobial therapy is
warranted, thus reducing the use of resources. Similarly, antibiotics are
not warranted for acute bronchitis.5 (Reference) In contrast, antimicrobial
therapy is usually indicated for pneumonia.
   Chest films--The definition of community-acquired pneumonia includes the
finding of new infiltrates on chest films. However, the prevalence of
pneumonia among adults with respiratory symptoms ranges from only 3% in a
general outpatient setting to 28% in emergency departments.1 (Reference)
Several factors have been found to be predictors of the presence of
pneumonic infiltrates on chest films: temperature higher than 37.7 degrees
C (100 degrees F), pulse rate more than 100 beats per minute, rales,
locally de-creased breath sounds, sputum production, and the absence of
asthma, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. Although these predictors serve as
guidelines, they certainly do not replace clinical judgment.
   We recognize that it is not practical to obtain a chest film in all
situations, but it can be helpful in differentiating conditions that mimic
pneumonia, and the findings may suggest causes or conditions such as
pneumocystic disease, tuberculosis, lung abscess, and pleural fluid.
Elderly patients with pneumonia may present with nonspecific
manifestations, such as a change in mental status, and the threshold for
considering pneumonia and obtaining chest films in such patients must be
lowered. Finally, pulmonary ``infiltrates'' may be falsely interpreted as
acute pneumonia if old chest films are not available to differentiate acute
from chronic changes; this is also a risk in patients with noninflammatory
causes of infiltration (ie, congestive heart failure, atelectasis). Thus,
appropriate evaluation of the chest film relies on accurate clinical
assessment.
   Hospital admission--Once pneumonia is suggested by findings on chest
films, the primary care physician must determine who can be safely treated
as an outpatient and who should be hospitalized. Indications for hospital
admission have been defined by a modified version of the appropriateness
evaluation protocol, a validated instrument used widely by quality
assurance organizations.6 (Reference) The specific indications for hospital
admission and risk factors for death are listed in table 1. Laboratory
studies that help clarify the severity of community-acquired pneumonia
include a hemogram, electrolyte determinations, and pulse oximetry or
measurement of arterial blood gases.

Etiology
   As noted, determining a specific cause of community-acquired pneumonia
has been made more challenging by the growing number of possible pathogens.
Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the leader, but recent reports have
recognized other microorganisms, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella
species, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis and, very recently, sin nombre
virus, which causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.1-4,7 (Reference) Other
known causes include Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, oral
anaerobes (associated with aspiration pneumonia), and viruses (influenza
virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus).
Penicillin-resistant strains of S pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing
strains of H influenzae and M catarrhalis have been isolated with
increasing frequency.
   Although secondary bacterial pneumonia after influenza is most commonly
due to S pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus also needs to be considered.
Gram-negative bacilli should be suspected when the patient is from a
nursing home. Pneumonia due to Pneumocystis carinii and other opportunistic
patho-gens has emerged in the past several years in association with HIV
infection and should be included in the differential diagnosis. In
addition, pulmonary tuberculosis has been increasingly implicated in cases
of community-acquired pneumonia over the past several years and deserves
consideration whenever the cause cannot be readily explained. Table 2 shows
the expanding list of pathogens to be aware of when evaluating
community-acquired pneumonia in either immunocompetent or immunocompromised
patients.
   Several recent studies have determined the relative proportion of
specific causes of community-acquired pneumonia; table 3 shows data from
three such studies3,4,8 (Reference) and distinguishes between pneumonia
treated on an outpatient basis and that treated in a hospital. Traditional
pathogens such as S pneumoniae and H influenzae account for 25% to 40% of
cases. Pneumonia due to Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, or Legionella species (often
referred to as ``atypical'') comprise another 15% to 30% of cases. In table
4, the most common causes are correlated with patient categories that are
based on disease severity and comorbidities.
   In most studies, a specific cause is not found for 30% to 50% of cases
of community-acquired pneumonia. A percentage of such cases may indeed not
be infectious pneumonia. It is well known that other conditions, such as
vasculitis, drug reactions, and pulmonary infarction, may present with
manifestations mimicking infectious pneumonia. Unrecognized pathogens
undoubtedly account for a certain percentage of undefined cases.
   Detailed history taking may be helpful in establishing a diagnosis.
Epidemiologic clues to possible pathogens are listed in table 5. A
controversial issue concerns whether the cause of pneumonia (eg,
pneumococcus versus mycoplasma versus legionella) can be differentiated on
the basis of clinical features. Certain findings are likely to be
associated with specific causes: Acute onset and a single shaking chill
(rigor) are cardinal features of streptococcal pneumonia; markedly elevated
temperature (higher than 39.4 degrees C [103 degrees F]) is more common
with legionella pneumonia; prodromal fever and myalgia followed by
pulmonary edema and hypotension are characteristic of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome; diarrhea is more common with atypical pneumonia; and underlying
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is more often seen with bacterial
pneumonia.3,8 (Reference) In addition, there are reports of associated
asthma in patients who have elevated chlamydial antibody titers.9
(Reference) It is our experience, however, that asthma is unlikely to be
associated with the primary infection, and recent data from others do not
support a significant role for acute C pneumoniae infection in provoking
acute bronchospasm in adults.10,11 (Reference) Despite these clinical
clues, recent studies have shown that clinical findings overlap in cases of
pneumonia caused by different agents, rendering distinction on a clinical
basis unreliable.5,6 (Reference)

Specific diagnostic evaluation
   Once the clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia has been
made, consideration should be given to the microbiologic diagnosis. Such
information can be useful for both prognosis and therapy. Unfortunately,
rapid diagnostic tests are not available for many of the microorganisms,
and initial therapy is usually empirical. However, diagnostic procedures
that provide information on a specific cause within 48 to 72 hours can
still help define continuing therapy.
   Identification of the specific cause relies on isolating the
microorganism or on determining the presence of a specific antigen or
antibody. Table 6 lists the diagnostic tests that we recommend for
evaluation of community-acquired pneumonia. However, it must be
reemphasized that even after extensive studies are done, the pathogen
remains unidentified in 30% to 50% of cases.
   The extent of diagnostic evaluation that is undertaken depends to a
degree on the severity of illness. Patients under age 60 who do not have
underlying disease can often be safely treated without diagnostic tests;
oral antimicrobial agents directed against the pathogens that are most
commonly seen in this group (S pneumoniae, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia
species) can be given.
   Because of the greater potential for serious morbidity (and mortality),
patients who require hospitalization should have diagnostic evaluation. The
difficulty in specifying a cause on clinical grounds and the awareness of
antimicrobial resistance that reduces the predictability of response to any
given antibiotic are additional important reasons to define the pathogen in
these patients.
   Sputum evaluation--Although sputum evaluation may be helpful, often it
is not available. Studies of sputum include both staining procedures and
cultures. The significance and predictability of Gram's stain are
debatable.12 (Reference) Nevertheless, we believe that it can be useful in
diagnosis and therapy when there is a predominance of gram-positive or
gram-negative organisms from an appropriate specimen (ie, one with a large
number of neutrophils and a paucity of squamous epithelial cells). All too
often, however, sputum smears demonstrate only normal oral flora, are of
poor quality, or are unobtainable. Nonetheless, the direct results of a
sputum stain may be helpful in defining some pulmonary infections,
including those caused by mycobacteria.
   Similarly, routine sputum cultures are neither sensitive nor specific.
They often show pathogens that are only colonizing the respiratory tract,
and even in cases of bacteremic pneumonia, the causative pathogen can be
isolated from sputum culture in only 40% to 60% of cases.
   In contrast, recovery from cultures of organisms that are never part of
the respiratory flora may be meaningful; therefore, in appropriate
circumstances, sputum should be cultured for mycobacteria, legionellae, and
fungi. (The physician must be aware that special, selective media are
needed for such organisms and that the laboratory must be advised in these
situations.) Isolation of penicillin-resistant pneumococci and other
antibiotic-resistant microorganisms can also be very meaningful and helpful
in directing subsequent therapy. Culture of M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae is
possible, but it is difficult and requires specialized techniques. Because
of this, most microbiology laboratories are not set up to culture these
organisms, and diagnosis is usually based on serologic tests.
   Blood and pleural fluid cultures--Blood cultures should always be done
when a patient requires hospitalization. Although they are positive in only
about 10% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, diagnosis is specific.
Similarly, cultures of pleural fluid, if it is present, are highly specific
and should be done to rule out complicated parapneumonic fusion or empyema
as well as to establish the cause of community-acquired pneumonia.
   Invasive techniques--More invasive diagnostic techniques, such as
fiberoptic bronchoscopy, can be very sensitive in identifying the pathogen.
Although such techniques are expensive and impractical for routine use,
they should be considered for patients with a fulminant course, those who
require admission to the intensive care unit, and those who are at risk for
opportunistic pathogens or have complex pneumonias that are unresponsive to
antimicrobial therapy.
   Serologic tests--These are usually not helpful in the initial assessment
of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. They can be worthwhile for
epidemiologic purposes when they show a fourfold rise between acute and
convalescent paired specimens. Cold agglutinins may be present in cases of
mycoplasmal infection, but tests are positive in only a minority of cases
and are not specific. IgM antibodies may be present in serum within the
first week of mycoplasmal infection, but the serologic response to
chlamydia and legionella takes longer. The most reliable antibody test for
C pneumoniae is a microimmunofluorescence technique. Complement-fixation
antibody tests are available but are not as specific. In cases of primary
infection due to C pneumoniae, the IgM antibody response may take up to 4
weeks and the IgG antibody response up to 8 weeks to appear. Therefore, the
absence of detectable antibodies (even IgM) several weeks after infection
does not exclude the diagnosis. During reinfection, the IgG antibody level
rises rapidly, whereas the IgM antibody level may not change.
   Results of the acute antibody test for legionella in cases of
legionnaires' disease are usually negative or of low titer because it is
too early in the course of illness to engender a response; thus, a negative
result on an acute antibody test does not exclude this diagnosis.
Unfortunately, we have observed cases of community-acquired pneumonia in
which appropriate therapy was not administered because of misinterpretation
of the ``negative'' acute antibody test. An elevated acute antibody titer
suggests a diagnosis of pneumonia due to Mycoplasma, Legionella, or
Chlamydia species, but it is not definitive. It has been acceptable to
label a case as ``probable'' or ``presumptive'' if the acute titer is
highly elevated (see following section on diagnostic criteria); however, it
is our experience that a single elevated titer (without confirmation by
another test such as culture or antigen detection) often reflects old
rather than acute infection. In a study of legionnaires' disease in Ohio,
we found that an acute antibody titer of more than 1:256 had a positive
predictive value for acute legionnaires' disease of only 15%.13 (Reference)
The percentage of patients with elevated acute titers who had confirmed
legionnaires' disease was not significantly different from that of patients
who did not. Thus, on the basis of our own experience, we believe that
acute-phase serum specimens should be obtained for patients with
community-acquired pneumonia and saved. If the pathogen remains in
question, a convalescent-phase specimen can be obtained and paired studies
performed.
   Rapid diagnostic tests--The urinary antigen test, which has recently
become available in most reference laboratories, has been shown to be very
valuable for rapid identification of legionella. Present techniques test
only for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, but this organism accounts for
about 80% of clinical cases of community-acquired pneumonia due to
legionella. The urinary antigen test is positive in about 80% of cases
within the first days of illness and is highly specific. A negative test
does not exclude legionella pneumonia (particularly if caused by organisms
other than serogroup 1), but a positive test is diagnostic.
   Several rapid diagnostic tests, such as DNA probes or polymerase chain
amplification for evaluation of respiratory secretions or serum, are being
developed (especially for chlamydial, mycoplasmal, and legionella
pneumonia) but are not routinely available at present. Once such tests
become available, they should be extremely helpful in allowing directed
therapy at presentation.
   Diagnostic criteria--The specificity of diagnosis varies with the test
used. For example, a positive blood culture for S pneumoniae is much more
specific than a positive sputum culture without a positive blood culture.
Accordingly, the following would generally be considered as evidence of
definite infection by a specific microorganism:
   1. Blood or pleural fluid yielding a pathogen
   2. A fourfold rise in antibody titer to L pneumophila, M pneumoniae, C
pneumoniae, or other specific pathogen
   3. Isolation of L pneumophila, influenza virus, or Mycobacterium
tuberculosis from respiratory secretions
   4. Positive legionella urinary antigen test
   Isolation of a pathogen from purulent sputum with identification of a
compatible organism on Gram's stain is generally considered to be evidence
of probable cause. Similarly, presence of a single elevated antibody titer
(legionella immunofluorescent antibody titer greater than 1:250 or C
pneumoniae microimmunofluorescent antibody titer greater than 1:512 [IgG]
or 1:16 [IgM]) has been considered evidence for presumptive diagnosis by
several authorities. However, as we have stated previously, it is our
experience that these criteria are often unreliable.
   In conclusion, the physician must consider the usefulness of various
diagnostic tests when formulating an initial plan of management for a
patient with community-acquired pneumonia. While the results of certain
procedures (blood culture or legionella urinary antigen test) are specific,
the results of others (sputum culture and initial serologic tests) are only
presumptive. With the exception of the sputum Gram stain (with its
acknowledged pitfalls), there are no immediately available rapid diagnostic
tests; thus, initial therapy is usually empirical.

Summary
   Characteristic clinical findings of fever, cough, and rhonchi, together
with a new infiltrate on chest films and documentation of a pathogen,
establish a diagnosis of infectious pneumonia. Several factors have had an
impact on the approach to diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia by the
primary care physician. These include the expanding number of possible
pathogens as well as their increasing resistance to antimicrobial therapy.
   Although the clinical presentation may suggest a specific cause,
findings often overlap too much for reliable identification of the specific
agent on clinical grounds alone. Isolation of the micro-organism or
determination of the presence of a specific antigen or antibody is
necessary. However, even after extensive studies are performed, the
pathogen remains unidentified in 30% to 50% of cases. The primary care
physician therefore needs to balance reasonable use of diagnostic tests
with empirical therapy.

PNEUMONIA, A FIVE-ARTICLE SYMPOSIUM: INTRODUCTION

By:
Burke A. Cunha, MD, SYMPOSIUM COORDINATOR

   Pneumonia is one of the most common infectious diseases encountered in
practice. The first step in evaluation should be to determine whether the
patient does, in fact, have pneumonia. Patients usually have a variety of
nonspecific respiratory symptoms, which should be sorted out as originating
in either the upper or lower respiratory tract. Upper respiratory tract
infections (eg, sinusitis, pharyngitis, tracheobronchitis) cause no
pulmonary signs. The presence of pulmonary findings, with or without
symptoms of upper respiratory infection, points to pneumonia.
   Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia rests on auscultatory and chest film
findings. Laboratory findings may be absent very early in the infection and
in the presence of leukopenia or dehydration. Similarly, the lungs are
conspicuously quiet in viral or interstitial pneumonia (eg, viral
influenza).
   Sputum may originate in the bronchi or alveoli, and findings on testing
of such samples are helpful in suggesting pneumonia only if they relate to
the infiltrate or chest film. Testing of a properly collected sputum
specimen from the lower respiratory tract is useful in suggesting the
causative agent in community-acquired pneumonia but is useless in
nosocomial pneumonia. In the right clinical context, a sputum Gram stain is
helpful, but unless it is absolutely diagnostic, initial treatment should
be empirical. Characteristics of sputum may provide diagnostic clues to the
type of community-acquired pneumonia. For example, thin, mucoid sputum
suggests atypical pneumonia, compared with the frankly purulent sputum that
suggests a bacterial process.
   Chest films are key in investigation of community-acquired pneumonia.
They confirm the diagnosis, and specific findings often suggest a
particular organism. For example, pleural effusion, cavitation, and lobar
involvement are helpful findings when interpreted in the proper clinical
context. The behavior of infiltrates over time may be diagnostically
useful. Those that clear rapidly (1 or 2 days) probably are not infectious,
but rapidly progressive asymmetric infiltrates suggest legionella
infection. Infiltrates may be absent if chest films are obtained very early
in the disease process but usually appear within 24 hours after the patient
presents for medical attention.
   Even when an infiltrate is present, the diagnosis of community-acquired
pneumonia may be uncertain. Many conditions mimic pneumonia, and unless the
cause is quickly recognized as noninfectious, needless expense, potential
antibiotic resistance, and delay in proper treatment may result.
   Failure of pneumonia to resolve represents another issue. Delayed
resolution of community-acquired pneumonia is being recognized increasingly
in elderly and immunocompromised patients.
   Because virtually any antibiotic with an appropriate spectrum provides
adequate treatment of pneumonia, the challenge is to find the most
cost-efficient approach and monitor clinical effectiveness. An important
new development, particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness, is the
capability to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy. For
example, at Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, New York, the difference
between intravenous and oral therapy with one particular antibiotic is $74
versus $5.44 per day. The goal is to select an oral antibiotic that is
active against both typical and atypical pathogens, has good
bioavailability and low resistance potential, and is cost-effective.
Unfortunately, relatively few oral agents meet these criteria.
   In patients requiring hospital admission, antibiotic therapy should be
started intravenously and then, if clinically possible, switched after 3
days to an oral form for completion of therapy. Recent studies have shown
that oral therapy is effective in a variety of infectious diseases, even in
very ill patients. Although oral therapy will never be possible in all
patients, the era of oral antibiotic therapy is clearly upon us, not only
because of economic pressures but also because of new knowledge. This
symposium presents an overview of the latest research findings, as well as
practical information gained from the school of clinical experience.

ATYPICAL PNEUMONIA: EXTRAPULMONARY CLUES GUIDE THE WAY TO DIAGNOSIS

By:
Burke A. Cunha, MD
Antonio M. Ortega, MD

Preview
   As the name implies, atypical pneumonia does not follow the usual form.
However, infecting organisms do cause characteristic patterns of organ
involvement, which provide important clues to clinicians. The authors
describe clinical diagnosis of the most common causative organisms of
atypical pneumonia by means of a syndromic approach. They also discuss
which antimicrobial agents have been found to be useful against these
organisms.

   Certain pathogens are typically associated with community-acquired
pneumonia, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococci,
Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and, less
often, Klebsiella species. In patients recovering from viral infection and
occasionally in diabetic patients, Staphylococcus aureus infection is
found.
Community-acquired pneumonia can also be caused by less common pathogens.
These atypical pneumonias are divided into two forms: nonzoonotic (ie, not
transmitted from animals to humans) and zoonotic (transmissible from
animals). Nonzoonotic forms are the more common and are an important
diagnostic consideration in evaluation of community-acquired pneumonia.
   This article presents an overview of the clinical approach to three
nonzoonotic atypical pneumonias: legionnaires' disease (caused by
Legionella species), mycoplasmal pneumonia (caused by Mycoplasma
pneumoniae), and Chlamydia pneumoniae (strain TWAR) pneumonia (table 1).
Although zoonotic pneumonia is not discussed in detail, characteristics of
three forms are summarized in table 2 for use in differential diagnosis:
psittacosis (caused by Chlamydia psittaci), Q fever (caused by Coxiella
burnetii), and tularemia (caused by Francisella tularensis).
   Thorough reviews of both typical and atypical causes of
community-acquired pneumonia are available in the literature.1-4
(Reference)

Diagnostic approach
   Although the microorganisms in atypical pneumonia usually cause
prominent pulmonary manifestations, the illness should be viewed as a
systemic infectious disease with a pulmonary component. Indeed, it is the
extrapulmonary manifestations that are a hallmark, so if a case of
pneumonia is accompanied by otherwise unexplained extrapulmonary signs,
symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities, atypical pneumonia should be
presumed.
   Whether a patient has nonzoonotic or zoonotic atypical pneumonia should
be established if possible. A history of contact with animals or animal
products is usually available to suggest a zoonotic form. If no
epidemiologic associations or diagnostic clues point to a zoonotic atypical
pathogen, the working diagnosis is quickly narrowed to the more common,
nonzoonotic forms.5-8 (Reference)
   Carefully conducted history taking and physical examination should be
completed in an attempt to define organ involvement by the putative
pathogen. All organisms causing atypical pneumonia have a characteristic
pattern of organ involvement that provides clues to diagnosis of these
pneumonias. Key findings include relative bradycardia, upper respiratory
tract involvement, diarrhea, abnormalities in liver function tests,
elevation of cold agglutinin titer, and decreased serum phosphorus level.
Very few findings are in themselves pathognomonic of any disease process;
it is the pattern of occurrence that makes the constellation of findings
diagnostically specific.5-7 (Reference) Thus, a syndromic approach, in
which history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are combined,
is best in establishing a working diagnosis of atypical pneumonia. For
example, assume a patient with community-acquired pneumonia and
extrapulmonary findings has atypical pneumonia. If he or she also has
diarrhea, the diagnosis is clearly limited to legionnaires' disease or
mycoplasmal pneumonia. If the patient has a pulse-temperature deficit (ie,
relative bradycardia), diagnostic possibilities include legionnaires'
disease, psittacosis, or Q fever. Similarly, even a slight unexplainable
abnormality in results of liver function tests in a patient with atypical
pneumonia limits diagnostic possibilities to legionnaires' disease,
psittacosis, or Q fever. Hyponatremia is a common but nonspecific finding,
but the finding of hypophosphatemia points to legionnaires' disease.
   Since legionnaires' disease, mycoplasmal pneumonia, and C pneumoniae
pneumonia are the most often encountered atypical pneumonias, the main
diagnostic thrust should be to identify the pathogens responsible for these
forms. Mycoplasmal infection in normal hosts and C pneumoniae pneumonia in
young adults are rarely fatal, so workup should first focus on identifying
or eliminating legionnaires' disease, which can be fatal if left
untreated.
   Serologic diagnosis of all these atypical pathogens is made on the basis
of a single initial high titer or a fourfold increase between acute and
convalescent titers.

Legionnaires' disease
   Legionnaires' disease may be caused by any of the Legionella species.
The highest incidence is in late summer and early fall, but cases can occur
at any time of the year. Legionnaires' disease is transmitted by
aerosolized droplets of water. For example, outbreaks have occurred in
hospitals as a result of contaminated water sources or nearby excavation or
construction. Although legionnaires' disease is treatable with
tetracyclines and macrolide antibiotics, fatalities still occur in elderly
patients and compromised hosts. Therefore, early presumptive diagnosis is
essential so appropriate treatment can be started as soon as possible.
   Legionnaires' disease presents clinically and radiologically as atypical
pneumonia. Its onset is usually subacute but may be fulminant. Pulmonary
manifestations are not sufficiently different from those caused by other
pulmonary pathogens to permit a specific diagnosis. As noted earlier, the
clinical clues lie in extrapulmonary findings, as they do in other types of
atypical pneumonia.
   Signs and symptoms--Legionnaires' disease is characterized by relative
bradycardia, mental status changes or mild headache, abdominal discomfort
or pain, and diarrhea. The signs and symptoms do not respond to beta-lactam
antibiotics. Ear pain, sore throat, or rash argues strongly against the
diagnosis of legionnaires' disease.
   Chest films--With atypical pneumonia, a specific diagnosis cannot be
made from the appearance on chest films. However, legionnaires' disease
should be suspected in patients who have pneumonia and rapidly progressive
asymmetric infiltrates.5,6 (Reference)
   Laboratory findings--Certain laboratory tests are helpful in making a
presumptive diagnosis of some atypical pneumonias. A slight increase in
serum transaminase levels (without antecedent alcoholic cirrhosis or liver
disease) in a patient presumed to have atypical pneumonia immediately
limits diagnostic possibilities to legionnaires' disease, psittacosis, or Q
fever. Hyponatremia is more common in legionnaires' disease than in other
atypical pneumonias but is not specific for legionella infection.
Hypophosphatemia (except in patients who have other causes of a low serum
phosphorus level) strongly implicates a Legionella species as the infecting
organism in patients with atypical pneumonia.
   Moderate to high elevation of cold agglutinin titers argues strongly
against the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease. (Elevation of these titers
is useful primarily in diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia.)
   Initial serum legionella titers are diagnostically helpful only if
highly elevated (ie, greater than or equal 1:256) in a patient with illness
compatible with legionnaires' disease. The usual situation is that the
physician suspects legionnaires' disease and orders serologic workup, only
to find that initial results are normal. In most patients with
legionnaires' disease, titers are not elevated early in the disease;
therefore, normal levels should not exclude the diagnosis. About 6 to 8
weeks after the onset of disease, titers should be obtained; at this point,
a diagnostic elevation is usually present.
   If a patient with legionella pneumonia has a productive cough and has
not received prior antimicrobial therapy, a diagnosis of legionnaires'
disease may be rapidly confirmed with a direct fluorescent antibody stain
for legionella organisms in the sputum. However, legionella positivity on
this stain decreases rapidly after effective antibiotic therapy has begun.
Some patients do not have effective antibody responses, and antimicrobial
therapy itself may blunt, delay, or eliminate antibody responses so that
there is little or no elevation in legionella titers. Therefore, without a
positive sputum direct fluorescent antibody test for legionella, the
initial working diagnosis must be made on the basis of clinical findings by
using the syndromic approach mentioned.

Mycoplasmal pneumonia
   M pneumoniae infection is one of the most common causes of atypical
pneumonia. This agent and the Legionella species are capable of growth in
cell-free media, which sets them apart from all other causative agents in
atypical pneumonia. Mycoplasmal pneumonia occurs at any time of the year,
although small epidemics during the late fall or winter, coincident with
the school year, are common. This finding is not surprising, given the fact
that transmission of the disease is from person to person via respiratory
droplets.
   Patients with mycoplasmal pneumonia seen in the office probably
represent a small proportion of cases, since most infections are benign and
self-limited. Many patients do not appear to be very ill, despite
abnormalities on chest films. This observation has led to the term
``walking pneumonia'' to describe the illness. On the other hand, patients
may appear very ill yet have only small, wispy infiltrates on chest films.
   Signs and symptoms--Onset of the disease is insidious and follows a 2-
to 3-week incubation period. The most characteristic sign is a dry cough,
which is usually unproductive. Other symptoms include mild headache,
malaise, nonpleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fever (usually between 101
and 102 degrees F [38.3 and 38.8 degrees C]). Patients often report
chilliness, but frank chills are uncommon. Chest pain is uncommon but, if
present, is due to muscle strain from repeated coughing.
   Its subacute onset and the absence of severe myalgias are important
clues distinguishing mycoplasmal pneumonia from viral pneumonia. Diarrhea
is common in mycoplasmal pneumonia, legionnaires' disease, and some of the
adenoviral pneumonias.
   Chest films--Despite the severity of cough, there is usually a paucity
of chest findings and no evidence of consolidation. Chest films usually
show infiltrates in the lung interstitium.
   Physical examination--Extrapulmonary manifestations are different from
and less evident than those of legionnaires' disease. Practically all organ
systems can be involved, since mycoplasmal pneumonia is a systemic
infectious disease.
   Skin manifestations are common and range from maculopapular eruptions to
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, which occurs in 5% to 10% of patients. Cardiac
involvement is the next most common extrapulmonary manifestation;
abnormalities may include arrhythmias, conduction defects, and congestive
heart failure. Neurologic complications are uncommon and include
meningoencephalitis and reversible transverse myelitis.
   Laboratory findings--Except for demonstration of elevated cold
agglutinin titers, routine laboratory tests are generally unhelpful in
diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. Cold agglutinins, which also occur in
viral infections, are not specific for mycoplasma, and they are elevated in
less than 75% of patients with the infection. However, the degree of cold
agglutinin response is greatest in mycoplasmal pneumonia; the higher the
titer is above 1:64 in a patient with pneumonia, the more likely the
diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia.
   The agglutinin-dissociation test is a quick bedside procedure for making
this determination. It consists of collecting blood in an oxalated tube and
immersing it, along with a control specimen, in wet ice for 1 to 2 minutes.
Agglutination of erythrocytes (with a negative control) on the side of the
glass tube and their disappearance on rewarming to 98.6 degrees F (37
degrees C) indicate that cold agglutinins are present in a titer of 1:64 or
more. Repeated agglutination on repeated immersion after rewarming
indicates the presence of mycoplasma, since viral cold agglutinins do not
exhibit this agglutination-dissociation behavior.
   The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgG antibodies can
cause much diagnostic confusion. An elevated mycoplasma titer (otherwise
uncharacterized) is invariably an IgG determination. An elevated titer
indicates past exposure rather than active disease, and patients should not
be diagnosed or treated on the basis of this finding. In contrast, an
elevated IgM titer usually indicates active disease, especially when
accompanied by extrapulmonary signs of mycoplasmal pneumonia.6,7
(Reference)

C pneumoniae pneumonia
   C pneumoniae is a common causative agent in respiratory tract diseases;
those seen most often by physicians are pneumonia and severe upper
respiratory tract infection. C pneumoniae pneumonia occurs sporadically but
may also present as outbreaks among college students or military recruits.
Transmission is from person to person via respiratory droplets. Children
are less likely than adults to acquire pneumonia; however, seropositivity
increases after the second decade of life, reflecting subliminal childhood
illness.
   It is important to consider C pneumoniae pneumonia early in the illness,
because macrolide antibiotics are relatively ineffective. The
characteristic presentation of C pneumoniae pneumonia is a mycoplasmal
pneumonia-like illness with laryngitis and failure to improve with use of
erythromycin. Tetracyclines (eg, doxycycline [Doryx, Vibramycin]) are the
preferred therapy for chlamydial pneumonias (eg, C pneumoniae pneumonia,
psittacosis).
   Signs and symptoms--C pneumoniae pneumonia may present in a manner
similar to mycoplasmal pneumonia, except for the frequent finding of
concurrent upper respiratory tract illness (eg, laryngitis). Sinusitis and
pharyngitis sometimes precede the onset of C pneumoniae pneumonia by a few
days to a week. Although pharyngitis and otitis are common findings in
mycoplasmal pneumonia, sinusitis is not. The presence of laryngitis and
hoarseness points to C pneumoniae pneumonia; laryngitis is not a feature of
other atypical pneumonias.
   Chest films--Patchy consolidation or interstitial infiltrates may be
revealed on chest films. Infiltrates are sometimes described as
funnel-shaped and, if present, may be a clue to the diagnosis. In C
pneumoniae pneumonia, unlike in mycoplasmal pneumonia, auscultation of the
chest may reveal evidence of consolidation; however, like in mycoplasmal
pneumonia, pleural effusions are uncommon.
   Laboratory findings--Diagnosis is usually made by serologic testing,
because the organism grows poorly in cell culture media and laboratory
findings are not specific. Primary infection produces a rise in IgM titer
within 2 to 4 weeks of onset of illness and a rise in IgG titer within 6 to
8 weeks. Reinfection may not cause an IgM response, but an IgG increase
occurs earlier than in primary infection. Complement fixation testing is
sensitive but not species-specific. Antibody testing specific for C
pneumoniae, rather than general chlamydial testing, should be requested.9
(Reference)

Therapy
   The main problem for physicians has been to differentiate typical
bacterial from atypical community-acquired pneumonia. The distinction is
particularly important because of therapeutic implications.
   Beta-lactam antibiotics have been used most often for typical
community-acquired pneumonia, and doxycycline or erythromycin is used if
the probable clinical diagnosis is an atypical pneumonia. If a case could
not be established as typical or atypical pneumonia, doxycycline or
erythromycin was added to the beta-lactam regimen.3,7 (Reference)
Monotherapy is highly desirable, since adding a second antibiotic greatly
increases the cost of treatment as well as the risk of side effects and
drug resistance.
   Fluoroquinolones have been suggested as monotherapy for
community-acquired pneumonia. However, some investigators have voiced
reservations regarding coverage against activity of S pneumoniae as well as
Legionella and Mycoplasma species. Ofloxacin (Floxin) is the most active
fluoroquinolone against S pneumoniae and is also effective clinically
against Legionella and Mycoplasma species.10,11 (Reference) In addition, it
is the least expensive fluoroquinolone and is available in both intravenous
and oral forms. For these reasons, at Winthrop-University Hospital,
Mineola, New York, we use ofloxacin as the first-choice fluoroquinolone for
respiratory infection and as monotherapy for typical and atypical
community-acquired pneumonia. Further savings may be possible by switching
from intravenous therapy to oral administration after 3 days.
   Switching from intravenous to oral therapy may also be accomplished with
azithromycin (Zithromax) or doxycycline. Azithromycin has the advantage of
providing 2 weeks' worth of therapy with only 5 days' worth of medication,
because drug levels in blood and tissue are so prolonged. After the initial
loading dose of 500 mg, only a single 25-mg capsule daily for 4 days is
required. It is more expensive than erythromycin but causes fewer
gastrointestinal side effects. However, azithromycin is not yet available
in parenteral form.
   Doxycycline has excellent bioavailability, making it an ideal agent for
transfer from intravenous to oral therapy. It is relatively inexpensive and
is the most cost-effective form of monotherapy for community-acquired
pneumonia. It has a high degree of activity against both typical and
atypical pathogens. If properly diluted, doxycycline is not associated with
phlebitis, and if taken with food, it causes few if any gastrointestinal
side effects.

Summary
   In atypical pneumonia, causative organisms are difficult to isolate, so
careful clinical assessment is essential in arriving at a working
diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis through serologic testing is usually
retrospective. Either a high initial titer or a fourfold or greater rise
between the acute and convalescent titer is considered diagnostic in a
patient with compatible illness. Legionella and mycoplasma organisms may be
cultured from respiratory secretions if plated on appropriate culture
media. Using a syndromic approach, physicians can almost always
differentiate typical from atypical community-acquired pneumonia and narrow
diagnostic possibilities among the atypical pathogens, making possible
institution of early, possibly lifesaving, empirical therapy.

Preview
   Community-acquired pneumonia can now be treated by selecting a single
antibiotic that is active against both typical and atypical pulmonary
pathogens. In the past, it was necessary to use two agents if the type of
pathogen could not be determined. In this article, Dr Cunha discusses his
approach to management using cost-effective monotherapy that can be started
intravenously and then switched to the oral route.

   Community-acquired pneumonia is a frequent problem in the ambulatory and
hospital setting. The common respiratory pathogens are usually responsible
(see box on page 110).1-4 (Reference)

Factors in antibiotic selection
   The main difficulty presented by community-acquired pneumonia is
selection of a cost-effective antibiotic regimen.5-7 (Reference) Today, in
the managed care era, cost-effectiveness is second only to antibiotic
efficacy as a consideration in the selection process. A corollary implied
by the concept of cost-effective treatment is that intravenous therapy must
be switched to oral therapy as soon as possible to maximize cost savings in
hospital patients.
   The most important factor in the empirical selection of an antibiotic is
proven effectiveness in vivo. The antibiotic should readily penetrate
bronchopulmonary secretions and be pharmacologically active at the site of
infection. Virtually all antibiotics used for pulmonary infections show
good penetration of the lungs. Aminoglycosides, for example, concentrate
well in the lung but are less active at the site of infection, where there
is local hypoxia, acidosis, and white blood cell debris.
   The antibiotic chosen should have an appropriate spectrum of activity.
Optimal coverage should be provided for the usual respiratory pathogens,
but unnecessary coverage of every possible pulmonary pathogen should be
avoided. The expensive and potentially harmful practice of ``adding
coverage'' results from an underappreciation of the potential for pathogen
resistance. The wasteful custom of adding antibiotics for unneeded
``gram-negative'' coverage also has important implications in the
development of resistant organisms in an institution, particularly in
intensive care areas.
   If the proper antibiotic monotherapy has been selected, there is no need
to add anything.5-9 (Reference) For example, doxycycline may be chosen for
initial empirical monotherapy. This agent is active against all relevant
gram-negative pulmonary pathogens, such as ampicillin-sensitive and
ampicillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella
(Branhamella) catarrhalis, and oral anaerobes (eg, Bacteroides
melaninogenicus). Doxycycline is also effective against
penicillin-resistant and penicillin-sensitive strains of Streptococcus
pneumoniae as well as all atypical organisms (Chlamydia pneumoniae,
Mycoplasma and Legionella species).10 (Reference) The only gram-negative
organism not covered by doxycycline is klebsiella, which is uncommon as a
cause of pneumonia in the general population. If this organism is suspected
clinically, another agent, such as a fluoroquinolone or a cephalosporin,
should be selected5,7,9 (Reference) (table 1).
   When typical and atypical organisms cannot be differentiated, clinicians
often elect to protect against both by using double-drug coverage. Although
coinfection is rare, a few patients have both pulmonary and extrapulmonary
findings, and double coverage is reasonable in these cases. Fortunately,
with the advent of intravenous-to-oral ``switch'' therapy (see the later
discussion), double coverage, which is not cost-effective, is almost never
necessary if the right single agent (ie, doxycycline, ofloxacin [Floxin],
or azithromycin [Zithromax]) is selected. These three antibiotics are
effective against all of the common typical and atypical pathogens that
cause community-acquired pneumonia. Prescribing a second antibiotic for
additional gram-negative coverage is expensive and unnecessary.
   Although a number of factors are very important prognostically, they
have no bearing on selection of an antibiotic for community-acquired
pneumonia.3,7 (Reference) (The author acknowledges that this is at variance
with the American Thoracic Society's approach.) These factors include age
of the patient, severity of illness, host defense status, potential for
beta-lactamase-producing organisms, and site of infection acquisition
(table 2). For example, pneumococcal infection is treated the same way in
young as in old adults, even though there are differences in prognosis.
Similarly, community-acquired pneumonia in a non-leukopenic cancer patient
is caused by the same pathogens as in a normal host and needs the same
coverage.

Choosing an oral antibiotic
   Because most beta-lactam agents are active against the usual pathogens,
there are many parenteral antibiotics for treating community-acquired
pneumonia. The choice among oral antibiotics, however, is restricted. Oral
penicillin, for example, is ineffective against ampicillin-resistant H
influenzae, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, Klebsiella species, M
catarrhalis, and all of the atypical pathogens. Its other disadvantages
include poor oral absorption and only moderate bioavailability, not to
mention the inconvenience of dosing four times a day. Amoxicillin (Amoxil,
Wymox) is given three times a day and has good bioavailability, but it
lacks activity against H influenzae, M catarrhalis, and all atypical
pathogens. Newer oral cephalosporins may be given less frequently and have
enhanced activity against H influenzae, but they are more costly and miss
atypical pathogens. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) (Bactrim,
Cotrim, Septra) is an ideal oral antibiotic unless the patient is allergic
to sulfa drugs, but it is suboptimal for community-acquired pneumonia
because of its lack of anti-klebsiella and antistreptococcal activity. The
commonly used erythromycin has limited activity against streptococci, H
influenzae, M catarrhalis, and Klebsiella species and is also an
unsatisfactory choice because of poor bioavailability, short half-life, and
gastrointestinal side effects. It is active against most atypical
pathogens. Penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae often is also
erythromycin-resistant.
   While many antibiotics have been used successfully to treat
community-acquired pneumonias, the three best antibiotics in terms of
spectrum, bioavailability, safety profile, and cost are ofloxacin,
doxycycline, and azithromycin (table 3). These antibiotics permit optimal
monotherapy of community-acquired pneumonias, which has tremendous
cost-saving implications.7 (Reference)
   Because community-acquired pneumonia caused by atypical pathogens has
clinically distinguishable features, specific rather than empirical therapy
is possible. For example, group A streptococcal pneumonia is characterized
by a large pleural effusion in addition to infiltrates; Staphylococcus
aureus pneumonia rapidly cavitates in 1 to 2 days; and klebsiella
pneumonia, which is usually in the upper lobe, cavitates after 3 to 5 days.
In these circumstances, an antistaphylococcal cephalosporin would be
recommended as the initial antibiotic selection.4,5 (Reference)

Inpatient versus outpatient therapy
   Traditionally, hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia is based
on how ill the patient is as well as on the need for intravenous therapy.
As intravenous-to-oral switch therapy and oral therapy alone become more
widely accepted, the rationale for intravenous therapy diminishes.
Critically ill patients requiring ventilatory support will always need
hospitalization. These patients are likely to be given intravenous therapy
initially and then switched to oral therapy as soon as possible.
   When it is generally realized that antibiotics with excellent
bioavailability are equally effective intravenously or orally, oral therapy
will become the standard of care. Third-party payers also need to recognize
that oral antibiotic therapy in the hospital saves money and that the cost
should be reimbursed.7,11,12 (Reference)

Intravenous-to-oral switch therapy
   Without compromising clinical effectiveness, oral antibiotics that are
well absorbed achieve essentially the same blood and tissue levels as such
intravenous drugs as fluoroquinolones, doxycycline, clindamycin (Cleocin),
and chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin). Only a few antibiotics that have an
appropriate spectrum for community-acquired pneumonias are available for
both intravenous and oral use. Ofloxacin is unique among fluoroquinolones
in being most active against Chlamydia species and, like other
fluoroquinolones, is also effective against Legionella and Mycoplasma
species.11 (Reference)
   The therapeutic approach we use at Winthrop-University Hospital,
Mineola, New York, is outlined in table 4. We begin intravenous therapy
with ofloxacin, 400 mg every 12 hours, and after 72 hours switch to oral
ofloxacin therapy, 400 mg every 12 hours. Patients who are unable to take
medications orally or who improve slowly may need intravenous therapy for
more than 3 days.
   Doxycycline and azithromycin are also ideal agents for empirical
monotherapy of community-acquired pneumonias and are most cost-effective
when given as part of an intravenous-to-oral switch program. Ofloxacin is
our preferred respiratory fluoroquinolone because of its high degree of
activity against S pneumoniae and, as was mentioned, Chlamydia, Legionella,
and Mycoplasma species. Furthermore, it is the least expensive
fluoroquinolone currently available.12 (Reference)
Theoretically, ofloxacin eliminates bacteria in a concentration-dependent
fashion and works optimally as a single 800-mg daily dose.* Recently, it
has been shown that oral administration of 400 mg of ofloxacin once daily
is as effective as and less expensive than 500 mg of ciprofloxacin (Cipro)
twice daily for moderate to severe infections, including community-acquired
pneumonia.12 (Reference)

Determining costs
   As noted, the most effective cost-cutting measure in managing
community-acquired pneumonia is making a change from intravenous to oral
antibiotic therapy as soon as clinically possible. For example, TMP-SMZ
costs $72 a day when given intravenously but only $0.75 a day orally.
Similarly, ciprofloxacin costs $74 a day intravenously and $5.68 a day
orally (table 5).
   Determining the true cost of antibiotic therapy to an institution is
complex, and it is not simply based on an accounting of pharmacy
acquisition costs. Hidden expenses include the administrative costs per
dose, cost of side effects, cost of monitoring antibiotic therapy, and cost
of measures to control outbreaks by resistant organisms. The total cost of
antibiotic therapy, therefore, is the sum of the charges for all these
factors.5-8 (Reference)

Summary
   At present, three antibiotics (doxycycline, ofloxacin [Floxin], and
azithromycin [Zithromax]) provide optimal therapy for both typical and
atypical community-acquired pneumonias. These agents permit a
monotherapeutic approach and are also ideal for intravenous-to-oral switch
therapy, which results in great cost savings for an institution and an
earlier discharge for the patient.
   The era of oral therapy has been ushered in because of economic
imperatives. Fortunately, bioavailability of these three antibiotics is
essentially the same when administered intravenously or orally. Moderately
to severely ill patients may be safely and effectively treated via the oral
route alone; however, most patients who require admission to the hospital
are initially given intravenous therapy, after which a change is made to an
oral antibiotic equivalent as soon as possible.13 (Reference)

Which pathogens are the culprits in community-acquired pneumonia?
   Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common cause of
community-acquired pneumonias, but Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella
(Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Mycoplasma and Legionella species are
important also. Community-acquired pneumonias due to Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Staphylococcus aureus, and group A streptococcus are seen less frequently
and are usually associated with specific population subgroups. For example,
S aureus pneumonia occurs almost entirely in diabetic patients or in those
who have had viral influenza. Similarly, community-acquired pneumonias due
to K pneumoniae are seen primarily in alcoholics and, less commonly, in
nursing home patients.

DELAYED RESOLUTION OF PNEUMONIA: WHEN IS SLOW HEALING TOO SLOW?

By:
Hugh Cassiere, MD
John C. Rodrigues, MD
Alan M. Fein, MD

Preview
   Some cases of pneumonia can be expected to respond slowly to treatment.
For example, resolution of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in an
85-year-old patient who smokes and has heart disease, diabetes, and
multilobar infiltrates is much more likely to be prolonged than is
mycoplasmal pneumonia in a 25-year-old, healthy, nonsmoking patient with a
unilobar infiltrate. The authors describe risk factors for and causes of
delayed resolution and present a workup strategy for cases that do not
respond within expected time limits.

   Community-acquired pneumonia is seen often by primary care physicians in
their daily practice, but in as many as half of cases, the causative
pathogen remains unidentified even after extensive initial diagnostic
testing. Recently published guidelines of the American Thoracic Society1
(Reference) recommend a more limited initial workup than has been used
traditionally and empirical antibiotic therapy aimed at the most common and
probable pathogens in a given patient. Although this approach is likely to
prove cost-effective, it might not work in all situations. When it is used,
clinical response must be diligently evaluated so patients who are
responding slowly or not at all are identified promptly.

When is resolution considered delayed?
   Most often, pneumonia responds to antibiotic therapy, with patients
experiencing gradual resolution of symptoms (eg, cough, sputum production,
fever, shortness of breath). However, in some cases pneumonia resolves more
slowly than expected or fails to resolve. The length of time that is
considered normal for resolution is estimated on the basis of the natural
history of the common pneumonias. In evaluating resolution, two fairly
distinct parameters are used: symptomatic improvement and radiologic
clearing of infiltrates.
   Symptom resolution--If a patient's condition is responding appropriately
to therapy, improvement in clinical findings is usually noted within 48 to
72 hours.1 (Reference)Thus, if fever or leukocytosis, for example,
persists for 48 to 96 hours, resolution of the pneumonia may be considered
delayed. Empirical therapy, chosen on the basis of symptoms, should not be
changed until 72 hours have passed unless clinical deterioration is
identified. Clinical deterioration may result from treatment failure or one
of many possible causes, discussed later.
   Radiologic resolution--In most infectious processes, radiologic
resolution lags behind symptomatic improvement. In general, patients who
have some response to therapy but persistent symptoms or radiologic
abnormalities beyond the expected limits of resolution are considered to
have slowly resolving pneumonia. For example, Kirtland and Winterbauer2
(Reference) defined slowly resolving pneumonia as symptomatic improvement
but less than 50% radiologic clearing after 4 weeks of therapy.
Nonresolving pneumonia shows little or no clinical improvement or
radiologic clearing after 4 weeks.
   Radiologic deterioration during therapy for community-acquired pneumonia
is common. However, a change in antibiotic coverage or initiation of an
extensive diagnostic workup is not necessary unless clinical deterioration
is also present.

Which coexisting conditions affect resolution of pneumonia?
   When delayed resolution of pneumonia has been established, the first
step in management is to determine whether certain medical conditions
coexist. Conditions shown in table 1 can cause myriad host- defense defects
that impair the body's response to infection.
   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and alcohol abuse are the
most common contributing factors in delayed resolution of pneumonia.
Alcohol's effects on host defenses are complex because coexisting factors,
such as malnutrition, can impair immune function on their own.

What causes delayed resolution of pneumonia?
   When pneumonia caused by a common pathogen fails to respond to therapy,
likely explanations include impaired host response, bacterial resistance
(eg, penicillinase-producing organisms), and inadequate empirical coverage
(eg, staphylococcal pneumonia). Nonresolving pneumonia may also be caused
by an uncommon or resistant pathogen, a noninfectious condition, or a
complication (table 2).
   Common pathogens--The nature of the host response plays a significant
role in resolution of pneumonia; normal resolution is often prolonged in
patients with significant coexisting conditions (eg, diabetes, COPD)
(figure 1).
   For example, in pneumococcal pneumonia (the most common type of
community-acquired pneumonia), half of patients have clear chest
radiographs at 5 weeks; most cases resolve in 8 to 12 weeks. However, the
resolution process is prolonged in bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia. By 9
weeks, only half of patients have clear chest radiographs, and most cases
are not resolved until 18 weeks have passed. In the study by Jay and
associates,3 (Reference) 60% of patients with bacteremic pneumococcal
pneumonia and coexisting disease still had abnormalities on chest x-ray
films more than 3 months after initiation of therapy. Resolution was even
more prolonged in patients over age 55 who had COPD and alcoholism.
   Mittl and colleagues4 (Reference) found that radiologic clearing of
community-acquired pneumonia was influenced most by age and the number of
lobes involved: Clearing decreased by 20% per decade, and multilobar
involvement cleared more slowly than unilobar involvement.
   Uncommon pathogens--Infection with an uncommon pathogen, such as a
species of Nocardia or Actinomyces, may cause nonresolving pneumonia. In
one study on nonresolving pneumonia, eight patients using long-term
corticosteroid therapy for COPD were found to have opportunistic fungal
infections.5 (Reference) Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage or
transbroncheal biopsy is useful in ruling out such pathogens.
   Noninfectious causes--Conditions that mimic pneumonia but are actually
noninfectious may produce slowly resolving or nonresolving infiltrates.
Some, such as bronchogenic carcinoma (figure 2), may be found during the
diagnostic workup, and others, such as Wegener's granulomatosis (figure 3),
may require open lung biopsy for diagnosis. Congestive heart failure can
produce signs that mimic pneumonia.
   Pulmonary complications--Such complications of pneumonia as abscess,
empyema, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary vascular congestion may delay
resolution of pneumonia. Computed tomography of the chest is helpful in
evaluating patients for these complications.

What is known about the natural history of pneumonia?
   Legionella infection has the longest resolution process of all the
community-acquired pneumonias. Its course is severe and rapidly progressive
and often ends in residual scarring and fibrosis. Its incidence is doubled
in patients who require mechanical ventilation. Macfarlane and associates6
(Reference) noted that only half of patients who have Legionella infection
have radiographic resolution at 10 weeks, and in some, 12 to 20 weeks are
required.
   Mycoplasmal infection is at the other end of the resolution spectrum.
Considered to have the shortest process, mycoplasmal pneumonia usually
resolves completely in 2 to 4 weeks. Residual scarring and fibrosis are
rare.6 (Reference)
   To a large extent, resolution processes of other pathogens that may
result in community-acquired pneumonia are unknown or poorly characterized.
Among these pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, enteric gram-negative
bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia species, Moraxella (Branhamella)
catarrhalis, and certain viruses. Extensive and detailed discussions are
available elsewhere.7,8 (Reference)

How should workup be decided?
   The unfortunate clinical reality is that the causative pathogen remains
unknown in many cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Thus, natural
history patterns are often unhelpful, and all pneumonias end up being
lumped together in the workup process. However, with use of a diagnostic
strategy such as that shown in figure 4, busy physicians can identify and
categorize patients who need further workup and consultation.
   In patients with significant coexisting disease, host-defense impairment
can delay the normal resolution process. Therefore, an early goal is to
differentiate impaired host responses from other causes of slowly resolving
and nonresolving infiltrates. Infiltrates that fail to clear at all over a
4-week period of observation or that take more than 12 weeks to resolve
require further workup. In such cases, uncommon pathogens and noninfectious
mimicking diseases must be ruled out.

Is there a typical presentation?
   At our institution (Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, New York),
nonresolving pneumonia accounted for 15% of all pulmonary consultations and
10% of all diagnostic bronchoscopies over a recent 2-year period. About 60%
of patients had community-acquired pneumonia that was slow to resolve
because of an impaired host response. About 20% had infection with an
uncommon pathogen (tuberculosis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,
actinomycosis, or cytomegalovirus) and 20% had a noninfectious cause
(Wegener's granulomatosis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing
pneumonia, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, or pulmonary infiltration
eosinophilia).9 (Reference) In our experience, a typical patient with
delayed resolution is an elderly man who has had symptoms for a month or
more before being referred for bronchoscopy.

Summary and conclusion
   Slowly resolving or nonresolving pneumonia is a clinical challenge, but
we believe it can be dealt with in a rational and decisive manner. The
following risk factors have been established for delayed radiographic
resolution of pneumonia and should be considered in patient evaluation:
Coexisting medical conditions
History of smoking
Advanced age
Multilobar involvement
Persistent fever or leukocytosis
Diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, and alcohol
abuse can impair immune function, which slows normal clearing of
infiltrates. Common and uncommon infectious agents, conditions that mimic
pneumonia (eg, a neoplasm, congestive heart failure), and pulmonary
complications (eg, abscess) can also result in delayed resolution.

RADIOGRAPHIC MIMICS OF PNEUMONIA: PULMONARY DISORDERS TO CONSIDER IN
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

By:

Preview
   Pinpointing the source of roentgenographic lung abnormalities can be
challenging because many noninfectious pulmonary disorders mimic pneumonia.
The authors of this article discuss the most common radiographic
presentations of lung disorders that may be mistaken for pneumonia,
including focal and diffuse infiltrates, nodules, cavities, and pleural
effusion. They also outline the role of thorough history taking and
examination in prompt and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary disorders.

   Many organisms can cause serious pneumonias. Early suspicion and prompt
diagnosis and management are essential to minimize morbidity and reduce
mortality. Clinicians often prescribe antibiotics empirically on the basis
of various clinical, radiographic, and laboratory signs of infection (table
1). The choice of antibiotics is influenced by the patient's age, the
presence of comorbid factors, the need for hospital admission, and the
severity of illness. In most patients whose symptoms resolve with
antibiotics, a causative organism is not identified on culture, though
clinical improvement suggests an infectious cause.
   Various noninfectious pulmonary disorders can mimic infectious
pneumonia. When such a disorder is present but is not considered at the
time antibiotics are prescribed, the true source of symptoms and
radiographic abnormalities may remain elusive. Thus, even when infectious
pneumonia is strongly suspected, the possibility of a noninfectious
disorder should always be considered at the time a chest radiograph is
obtained.
   With AIDS more than with any other disease, roentgenographic
abnormalities are thought to signify infection. Radiographic patterns
typical of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia often prompt initiation of
antiprotozoal therapy, with or without corticosteroids. Clinical and
roentgenographic evidence of improvement usually indicates successful
therapy; lack of such improvement raises suspicion of another infection,
usually one caused by an opportunistic organism. ``Drug failures'' and
autopsy findings have made it clear, however, that AIDS patients are prone
to numerous noninfectious pulmonary complications that mimic pneumonia
radiographically, including idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis and
lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (table 2).
   Awareness of the most common radiographic presentations of noninfectious
pulmonary diseases--focal and diffuse infiltrates, nodules, cavities, and
pleural effusion--might lead to a better outcome for all patients with
pulmonary ailments.

Focal infiltrates
   Localized infiltrates are the most commonly recognized roentgenographic
pattern in infectious pneumonia, so it is not surprising that noninfectious
pulmonary disorders that cause a similar pattern are sometimes overlooked.
Clinical signs and symptoms of these noninfectious lung ailments also may
be identical to those of infectious pneumonia. In these circumstances, the
key to correct diagnosis is an accurate history. For example, a history of
smoking in a patient with fever, cough, and radiographic evidence of a
focal infiltrate should raise suspicion of bronchogenic carcinoma. Alveolar
carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma may present in this way, with or
without postobstructive infection.
   Noninfectious pulmonary disorders are commonly missed in patients with
congestive heart failure and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. Consider, for example, a patient with cough, shortness of breath,
and a focal infiltrate who is hospitalized and treated with antibiotics for
presumed infection and an increase in diuretic dose. The next day, the
patient feels remarkably better and a chest radiograph demonstrates
clearing of the infiltrate. In such a case, the likely source of the
infiltrate is asymmetric pulmonary edema, not infection. With certain types
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the parenchyma of the lung is
greatly disturbed, resulting in widespread perfusion abnormalities. When
congestive heart failure occurs, edema develops principally in regions
where perfusion is maximized because of ventilation inequalities. The area
where the infiltrate occurs has the best ventilation-perfusion match. This
relationship is compromised by edema that occurs with heart failure, which
leads to cough and shortness of breath.

Diffuse infiltrates
   Many noninfectious disorders are known to cause diffuse pulmonary
infiltrates. Thorough history taking is essential to identify these
diseases early in their course. This is especially true in occupational and
drug-induced lung disease; knowledge of illicit drugs ingested,
particularly poisons, is critical to a good outcome. A misdiagnosis of
infectious pneumonia could obviously delay the benefit of appropriate
treatment, such as an antidote or even lung transplantation, which would be
required for accidental paraquat (herbicide) ingestion.
   Most noninfectious pulmonary disorders responsible for bilateral
infiltrates do not have a known cause and consequently pose a diagnostic
challenge. Diffuse parenchymal disorders are most often mistaken for
infectious disease. Many such disorders are progressive, so prompt
diagnosis and treatment are important. The collagen vascular disorders may
present with fever, productive cough, and marked shortness of breath. They
are usually suspected in patients with a history of either systemic lupus
erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. However, these diseases can present
initially with pulmonary manifestations, which can be a diagnostic
challenge.
   Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a final common pathway for many forms
of severe lung injury and is often overlooked in differential diagnosis of
bilateral diffuse infiltrates. Although its pathogenesis is unknown,
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may be, in part, immunologic in origin,
resulting from a complex series of cellular and biochemical events.
Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may help to control the
disease process, as is true with many noninfectious pulmonary disorders of
unknown cause that produce bilateral infiltrates. Early diagnosis (usually
by open lung biopsy) is imperative to exclude infectious and malignant
disorders.
   A noninfectious pulmonary disorder that is gaining attention in the
literature is bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP). It
has been linked to connective-tissue disease, drug therapy, organ and
marrow transplantation, infection, and toxic fume inhalation. However, it
may occur without known parenchymal insults. Masses of granulation tissue
form in the lumina of small airways and in alveolar ducts, and organizing
pneumonia occurs distal to these obstructions. Figure 1 shows diffuse
infiltrates on the chest radiograph of a 36-year-old woman with BOOP and
lymphomatoid granulomatosis, which were diagnosed on open lung biopsy.
Specific chemotherapy was administered, and dramatic radiographic clearing
of the infiltrates occurred.
   Vasculitic disorders, such as Wegener's granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss
syndrome, are often mistaken for infectious respiratory diseases.
Confluence of infiltrates on chest radiographs in both alveolar and
interstitial patterns may be observed. Fever, cough, and productive sputum
are often present. Open lung biopsy is required for diagnosis.

Pulmonary nodules
   Far more noninfectious than infectious pulmonary disorders cause diffuse
pulmonary nodules, which range in diameter from about 1 mm to 5 mm. Some
experts classify lesions smaller than 3 cm as nodules and those 3 cm or
larger as masses. Radiographically, nodules appear simply as patchy
consolidation, but careful analysis of the periphery of the lung--where
there is less superimposition of abnormalities--should allow assessment of
the nodular character. Table 3 lists, according to their location on chest
radiographs, noninfectious pulmonary disorders that may present with
multiple pulmonary nodules.
   Noninfectious diseases that have been known to cause nodular development
include allergic alveolitis and sarcoidosis and vasculitic processes, such
as Wegener's granulomatosis. Sarcoidosis and vasculitic disorders may be
particularly elusive early in their course. Extrapulmonary manifestations,
supported by serologic evidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme and
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, may suggest the diagnosis. Lung
biopsy is necessary for confirmation.
   Allergic alveolitis is a hypersensitivity reaction that affects the
parenchyma of the lung. Causative agents are usually organic but may be
reactive inorganic compounds. An increasing number of occupational,
avocational, and even iatrogenic environments are responsible for this
noninfectious disorder. Signs and symptoms resemble those of common
bacterial pneumonia, but a striking preponderance of complaints comes from
patients who are exposed to the offending antigen (eg, dusts, molds) in the
workplace. Flexible bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy reveal
noncaseating granulomas. Cortico-steroids are the treatment of choice.
Ideally, the source of the antigen should be identified, and the patient
should be removed from the offending environment.

Pulmonary cavities
   Parenchymal cavities may be fluid-filled or thick-walled (figure 2) or
possess an air-fluid level (figure 3). Presence of a parenchymal cavity, no
matter what the cause, implies necrosis and tissue breakdown. Cavitary
disease occurs most often with infection, but a number of noninfectious
pulmonary disorders may be overlooked in initial diagnosis.
   When an air-fluid level is not visible in a cavity, a noninfectious
cause should be considered. A history of smoking should raise suspicion of
a bronchogenic carcinoma (eg, squamous cell carcinoma), and if multiple
cavities are present, metastatic cancer from a distant primary site (eg,
head, neck, cervix) should be considered. Wegener's granulomatosis often
presents with multiple cavitary lung nodules. Also, occupational exposure
to coal (pneumoconiosis) by patients with rheumatoid lung disease may
result in Caplan's syndrome and large cavitary nodules. Finally, upper-lobe
cavitary disease in a patient with risk factors for pulmonary
thromboembolism should raise suspicion of pulmonary infarction.

Pleural effusions
   Most pleural effusions occur with a noninfectious disease process.
Nonspecific symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, and pleuritic
pain, arise from inflammation of the pleura, compromise of pulmonary
mechanics, or interference with gas exchange. They should prompt
consideration of noninfectious disorders in differential diagnosis.
   Metastatic disease of the pleura is the most common noninfectious cause
of pleural effusions. Carcinoma of the lung and breast and lymphoma account
for about 75% of pleural effusions related to malignant processes. Rarely,
a neoplastic lesion causes occlusion of a large airway, prompting
development of postobstructive infectious pneumonia. Analysis of pleural
fluid obtained by thoracentesis may demonstrate a high percentage of
polymorphonuclear cells, organisms on Gram's stain, or bacterial growth on
culture. Infection may coexist and go unrecognized.
   Collagen vascular diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus
and rheumatoid arthritis, are notorious for their inflammatory nature and
ability to cause exudative pleural effusions. When there is also evidence
of a parenchymal infiltrate, an infectious cause is most often initially
considered. Thoracentesis should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of a
collagen vascular disease (eg, an extremely low glucose level and a low pH,
as found in rheumatoid arthritis) and rule out an associated infection.
   Adverse reactions to drugs produce only a small percentage of all
pleural effusions. A level of suspicion is required so that the offending
medication can be identified and discontinued. Hydralazine hydrochloride
(Apresoline), procainamide hydrochloride (Pronestyl), isoniazid (Nydrazid),
and phenytoin sodium (Dilantin) have been linked to lupuslike symptoms,
including pleuritis. Nitrofurantoin (Furadantin), methysergide maleate
(Sansert), and methotrexate (Folex, Rheumatrex Dose Pack) may cause
accumulation of pleural fluid and minimal nonspecific signs and symptoms.

Conclusion
   The appearance of any abnormality on a chest radiograph calls for a
complete differential diagnosis, no matter how straightforward a diagnosis
may seem. Noninfectious pulmonary disorders are the most common sources of
radiographic abnormalities. Prompt recognition and timely, appropriate
treatment are essential to minimize morbidity. Because signs and symptoms
of pulmonary disorders are usually nonspecific, a complete history and
thorough physical examination are the best tools for identifying and
managing noninfectious pulmonary disorders.

ANOREXIA NERVOSA AND BULIMIA NERVOSA: WHEN THE PURSUIT OF BODILY
`PERFECTION' BECOMES A KILLER

By:
Kathryn J. Zerbe, MD

Preview
   The stereotypical picture of an anorexic or bulimic patient as a driven
young woman is no longer valid, if it ever was. The diseases may be
manifest in an athlete who insists on training despite injury, or in a
painfully thin grandmother who thinks she's holding onto her youthful
figure. Most of those affected are too obsessed with their appearance, as
they see it, to realize the medical damage being done. Dr Zerbe describes
behavioral clues to eating disorders and the role of primary care
physicians in intervention.

   Anorexia nervosa and its cousin bulimia nervosa are on the rise in
Western industrial societies and now afflict about 1.2 million young women
in the United States. The morbidity and mortality associated with these
diseases are high; anorexia alone carries a mortality rate of 18% to 20%.
Although lethality in an index year may be 1%, anorexia is often a chronic
condition and the probability of death increases over time.1,2 (Reference)
The death rate for bulimia may be equally high, although, since bulimia was
first described as a syndrome in 1979, long-term studies are only now being
carried out. Both disorders are devastating medically, socially, and
psychologically.

Diagnostic considerations
   A wasted, cachectic appearance is the obvious signifier of anorexia.
Typically, female patients note the lack of menstrual periods for at least
several months. Patients usually place undue emphasis on their appearance
and body image. While others observe that patients look like victims of
starvation, patients insist that they are fat. They may exercise to the
point of exhaustion and diet incessantly to get thinner and thinner. They
talk constantly about food, being fat, and losing weight (table 1) and may
alienate loved ones and health professionals with their relentless pursuit
of bodily ``perfection.'' Their psychological obsession with weight is the
most reliable historical guideline in helping rule out other medical causes
of cachexia, such as cancer, infection (eg, AIDS), or hyperthyroidism.
   Making the diagnosis of bulimia is trickier. Patients can be
underweight, normal weight, or overweight and still engage in binge eating
and purging, and they often keep bulimic symptoms secret. To fulfill
diagnostic criteria of bulimia, patients must eat excessively with an
accompanying sense of loss of control and attempt to compensate with such
measures as vomiting, excessive exercise, and misuse of laxatives to
prevent weight gain (table 2).
   Also preoccupied with weight, appearance, and body image, bulimic
patients may seek out physicians for ``help with their diet'' or for
medications to help them lose weight. Even when physicians have a high
index of suspicion and ask patients if they are bingeing or are purging by
vomiting, laxative or diuretic abuse, or misuse of insulin or thyroid
medication, patients may not tell the truth. Bulimic behaviors occur on a
continuum, from a few times a month to several times a day. Studies suggest
that as many as 17% of college-aged women engage in bulimic behaviors.3,4
(Reference)
   No single cause has been found for either anorexia or bulimia. The
spectrum of symptoms is generally conceded to result from an amalgam of
emotional, physical, sociologic, and family factors, and recent analyses
support the hypothesis that in some cases they may be genetically based.5
(Reference) From a clinical perspective, it is wise to stress to patients
and their families that these disorders represent a common end point of
some type of emotional turmoil. Because eating disorders are often
accompanied by depression, anxiety disorders (especially
obsessive-compulsive traits), and personality disorders, diagnosis and
treatment may be complex. The presence of comorbid conditions significantly
impacts prognosis and must be recognized for treatment to be effective.

Special populations
   Once believed to be afflictions of female adolescents and young adults,
eating disorders are increasingly seen in both sexes over the course of the
entire life cycle. In addition, they are now being found more often than
they were in earlier decades, in special populations, and in all
socioeconomic and cultural groups.
   Infants and children--Like adults who have gotten the media message that
a thin body is desirable in women and a muscular build is desirable in men,
young children have been influenced by the sociologic shift toward
overvaluing appearance as a measure of personal worth. Eating disorders are
being seen at a growing rate in young children.6-8 (Reference)
   Sometimes failure among infants to gain weight and to thrive is called
``infantile anorexia nervosa,'' but the roots of this problem are
distinctly different from the obsessive emphasis on thinness and the
disordered body image of children, adolescents, and adults with anorexia.
Common contributors to this condition are a rift in the parents'
relationship with each other or psychological difficulties of a parent.
Occasionally, an infant or child loses weight or refuses food after an
incident of choking or a painful diagnostic procedure (eg, suctioning).
   In childhood anorexia, a common and important cause is unwitting
introduction of disturbed attitudes about food by mothers who themselves
have an eating disorder or are preoccupied with weight and appearance.
Sometimes, parents insist that children be placed on a diet or even
withhold food during the years of most rapid growth. Occasionally, parents
request diet pills for chubby youngsters, unaware that increasing activity
and establishing appropriate eating habits are the best tools to prevent
later obesity. These parents must be instructed about the potential of
inducing eating disorders in their children.
   Males--One in every ten patients with an eating disorder is male. Young
men who participate in seasonal sports that specify a particular weight
(eg, wrestling) or that stress appearance and body build (eg, running,
skating) are at special risk. In addition, physicians should be aware of
the increased incidence of eating disorders in the male homosexual
population,9 (Reference) which may be first noted by excessive exercise and
relentless attempts to maintain a slender physique.
   Some research suggests that male patients with eating disorders have a
high incidence of substance abuse. This behavior appears to be part of an
impulse-control problem, in which alcohol, drugs, and food are misused to
calm emotional storms.
   Athletes--Young women and men who participate in dance, gymnastics,
running, rowing, or other sports that emphasize thinness and appearance are
at special risk for anorexia and bulimia. Coaches or teammates may note
progressive weight loss in an athlete or may report the smell of vomitus in
the locker room. Athletes may confide that their sport is their life and
that they feel driven to achieve at any cost.10 (Reference) Primary care
physicians can help athletes, coaches, and parents see the potential for
disaster if this fixation with an athletic identity persists despite
negative consequences.
   Some people use a high level of physical activity in an almost medicinal
way to combat depression (through endorphin ``highs''). Many anorexic
patients misuse exercise; they expend enormous amounts of energy by staying
in almost constant motion (eg, fidgeting, running in place). Often they can
be stopped from doing so only by admission to the hospital for continuous
bed rest and observation. Thus, compulsive exercise may accompany a bona
fide eating disorder or be analogous to it. Such ``activity disorders'' may
account for the addiction to exercise that some patients experience; for
example, they exercise excessively despite exhaustion, multiple injuries,
and warnings from physicians and coaches to stop.10 (Reference)
   older women--Eating disorders are not uncommonly seen in women in their
fourth through eighth decades.11 (Reference) Some women have harbored a
distorted body image since youth but could bring themselves to seek out
treatment only at mid life, when daughters, nieces, or granddaughters were
recognized to also have an eating disorder. More often, women begin to
experience long-term physical side effects of the eating disorder (table 3)
and recognize the negative influence it has had on their social and work
lives. Often, they have kept their eating problems a secret for years and
confess their struggles to their physician with much guilt and shame.
   In the elderly, anorexia must be differentiated from major depression
with melancholia. Depressed patients may have the delusional belief that
food is poisonous. Somatic delusions about the body (eg, ``I cannot eat
because I do not possess a stomach'') arise when primary depression has not
been adequately diagnosed or treated. In contrast, elderly anorexic
patients may be preoccupied with losses sustained during their lifetime or
a need to maintain a youthful figure as long as possible. Treatment methods
for elderly, delusional, depressed patients range from carefully regulated
antidepressant and antipsychotic medications to electroconvulsive therapy.
The latter treatment is particularly effective in elderly patients who are
medically compromised and imminently suicidal. Response of older anorexic
patients to psychotherapeutic intervention is best after nutritional
difficulties have been corrected.

Sexual abuse
   Recent studies suggest that a significant number of patients with eating
disorders have a past or present history of physical and sexual abuse.12,13
(Reference) Eating disorders in adolescents or young adults should prompt a
suspicion that normal intergenerational boundaries in the home may have
been breached. Traditionally, fathers, grandfathers, and uncles have been
suspected as the perpetrators of violence leading to eating disorders.
However, recent studies suggest that maternal incest may be a
little-recognized factor.
   Women who have been the victims of rape may attempt to cope with the
trauma by restricting their eating or purging after a meal. These women
often feel significant shame about what has happened to them and are more
likely to turn to their primary care physician than to a mental health
provider for support and understanding.

Medical complications
   Medical complications of anorexia and bulimia can affect all of the body
systems (table 3).
   In patients with anorexia, physical examination often reveals
bradycardia, hypotension with systolic blood pressure as low as 70 mm Hg,
and electrocardiographic abnormalities. Replenishing circulatory volume in
the feeding process can precipitate congestive heart failure. Anorexic
patients have an increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias and mitral
valve prolapse. Death occurring after long-term anorexia is likely to have
a cardiac cause and may be sudden and unexpected.14 (Reference)
   In patients with bulimia, cardiac and electrolyte disturbances secondary
to vomiting or to laxative or enema abuse are common. Most authorities
stress that serum magnesium and potassium levels be routinely monitored in
bulimic patients12 (Reference); however, sudden death has occurred even
after cardiac status and electrolyte levels have been routinely monitored
and found to be normal.
   The most common medical complications of bulimia are parotid gland
hypertrophy, dental caries, and erosion of tooth enamel. Enamel can become
eroded from the acidic effects of gastric contents in only a few months of
vomiting. Patients who cannot refrain from purging may be urged to rinse
the mouth with a neutralizing agent, such as sodium bicarbonate or tap
water. In addition, bulimia can lead to esophageal or gastric rupture.
Excessive laxative use may damage the mesenteric plexus of the intestinal
wall and cause persistent loss of bowel activity. Chronic pancreatitis,
although rare, has also resulted from bulimia.

Treatment considerations
   Most important, patients must be educated that their eating disorder has
significant medical complications. Before underlying psychological issues
can be tackled, patients need to be stabilized medically. For a significant
minority of patients, hospitalization is necessary, and because the eating
disorder may be so entrenched, a psychiatrist or psychologist must be
consulted.3 (Reference)
No pharmacologic agent has been found to be a panacea for either anorexia
or bulimia.15-17 (Reference) Some recent studies suggest that fluoxetine
hydrochloride (Prozac) in daily doses of 60 mg lessens the number of binge
episodes and the dysphoria accompanying bulimia. Fluoxetine has had
ameliorative effects in some patients with anorexia; however, it has also
been associated with weight loss in some.
   All anorexic or bulimic patients need psychotherapy to reverse their
entrenched ideas and distorted body image and to achieve other life goals.
Cognitive behavioral interventions and interpersonal therapies have both
been found to be helpful.18 (Reference) Patients should be taught ways to
prevent relapse, such as minimizing exposure to high-risk foods and
developing appropriate additional supportive methods. Other highly
effective techniques involve helping patients challenge negative beliefs
about body size and shape, examine and restructure thoughts about food, and
acquire assertiveness and social skills. Aiding them in developing an
eating pattern that focuses on regular balanced meals, particularly in an
interpersonal or group setting, may also be beneficial.19 (Reference)
Patients learn to replace with companionship the comfort they had received
from food, and they find role models in other people who eat normally
without preoccupation over every morsel, calorie, or new diet technique.
   Studies show that with psychotherapeutic help, as many as 75% of
patients with eating disorders improve significantly over time. Thus, it is
important for physicians to assume a firm, directive approach and to help
patients see the short- and long-term consequences of their disordered
eating. Using food diaries, seeking nutritional counseling, and planning
meals at least a day in advance help counter abnormal eating
behaviors.20,21 (Reference)
   In the case of severe anorexia, enteral or parenteral nutritional
intervention may be necessary. Although such intervention may help patients
temporarily increase their weight so therapy can proceed, it is not without
medical and psychological risks. Some patients react vehemently to having
control taken away, even though they may be near death. Thus, it is
advisable to seek consultation with an eating-disorder specialist in a
tertiary setting, enlist family support whenever possible, and be prepared
to advise temporary commitment for patients in acute jeopardy. After
several weeks, when the starvation state is ameliorated and the nutritional
status normalized, patients become more receptive to psychological work.
Therapy must be paced to enlist patients' strength and motivation in
building an identity less reliant on appearance as the source of
self-esteem and competence.

Summary
   Eating disorders probably result from a combination of emotional,
physical, and sociologic factors and are encouraged by a society that
values appearance as a measure of worth. Once believed to be a problem
largely among young women, the disorders are being found increasingly among
children, young athletes, men, and elderly women.
   Often accompanied by depression, anxiety, and personality disorders,
eating disorders may be difficult to diagnose. Patients with anorexia
nervosa often deny that they have a problem, despite obvious physical
signs. Patients with bulimia nervosa may hide their bingeing and purging
and have no overt signs. Primary care physicians may be the first to
suspect potential problems, including a patient's fixation on food, weight,
dieting, physique, and exercise. Sometimes, patients who have struggled in
silence for years turn to their trusted physician for support and
understanding. The first step in treatment is to address the medical
complications caused by the unhealthy eating habits. Once nutritional
health has been restored, patients need to reverse their entrenched and
distorted body-image ideas through psychotherapy.

TREATING PRURITUS: WHAT'S NEW IN SAFE RELIEF OF SYMPTOMS?

By:
Larry E. Millikan, MD

Preview
   Have you ever had poison ivy or another intensely pruritic condition? If
so, you can probably sympathize with sufferers' common cry: ``It's driving
me crazy!'' Unfortunately, few pharmacologic agents have proven to be
routinely effective for pruritus. This article provides an overview of
current therapeutic strategies, including use of a new topical agent.

   Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of pruritus are always
necessary, but prompt relief of pruritus itself is also important.
Discomfort can be considerable. Patients scratch in an effort to relieve
pruritus, but ironically, this may contribute to skin damage, inflammation,
and recurrence. Interruption of the destructive itch-scratch cycle is a
primary goal in treatment of pruritus.

Pruritic conditions
   Pruritus is a common symptom of many dermatologic disorders and several
systemic diseases.1 (Reference) Table 1 summarizes important diagnostic
considerations.
   Xerosis--By far, the most common cause of pruritus without rash is
xerosis, or winter itch. This condition is characterized by moderate to
severe itching of dry, cracked, scaly skin, most often on the lower legs.
Bathing too often, old age, and high temperatures with low humidity can be
causative factors.
   Infestations, bites, infections--Many patients experience moderate to
severe itching during such infestations as scabies or seabather's eruption
(caused by jellyfish larvae) or after insect or other bites (figure 1).
Although these conditions are self-limiting or amenable to pharmacologic
intervention, some form of antipruritic therapy is usually employed for
symptomatic relief.
   Viral exanthems (eg, varicella), superficial fungal infections, and
occasionally even cutaneous bacterial infections (eg, hot-tub folliculitus)
can cause great discomfort. Again, treatment of the underlying condition is
crucial, but from the patient's standpoint, so is relief of symptoms.
   Neurogenic disorders--Notalgia paresthetica may cause prickling,
burning, and pruritic sensations in the region supplied by the lumbar
nerves.
   Inflammatory disorders--Intense, unrelenting pruritus is the hallmark of
several chronic cutaneous inflammatory disorders, ranging from atopic
dermatitis to urticaria (figure 2). Historically, the terms ``eczema,''
``dermatitis,'' and ``eczematous dermatitis'' have been used to describe
the final common expression of various conditions, such as contact
dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus, nummular eczema,
and dyshidrotic eczema.2 (Reference) Other commonly encountered pruritic
inflammatory skin diseases include lichen planus, nodular prurigo, and
dermatitis herpetiformis. Patients with psoriasis may also be troubled by
pruritus.
   From the patient's perspective, the intensity of the pruritus determines
how severe he or she considers the dermatitis to be. Often, pruritic
dermatitis elicits repetitive scratching, which leads to excoriations
followed by opportunistic infections, hyperkeratotic skin changes, and
lichenification.1-3 (Reference)
   Contact dermatitis--Accounting for up to 40% of all occupational
illnesses,3 (Reference) contact dermatitis consists of two types: irritant
and allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by a direct toxic
effect on the skin. Implicated substances include cosmetics, industrial
chemicals, cleansers, and lubricants. Allergic contact dermatitis results
from a type IV hypersensitivity reaction to substances found in plants (eg,
poison ivy), rubber, wool, nickel, or topically applied drugs (eg,
``caine''-type anesthetics).
   Atopic dermatitis--Up to 5% of children under age 7 experience atopic
dermatitis (figure 3), and more than 90% outgrow the disease by
adolescence. The etiology of this condition is unknown. There is an
apparent genetic predisposition that can be exacerbated by such external
factors as food allergy, irritating clothing, dry air, and emotional
stress. Patients tend to have a personal or family history of asthma,
seasonal or perennial rhinitis, and various allergies.
   Pruritus is the most distressing and prominent symptom of atopic
dermatitis. Many physicians feel that pruritus may be the primary or
initiating event in a flare-up of atopic dermatitis and that rubbing and
scratching damage the skin and induce inflammatory lesions. Acute flare-ups
are generally followed by long quiescent periods. In infants, atopic
dermatitis manifests as intensely pruritic lesions on the head and extensor
areas. In older children and adults, the flexural folds are more often
affected4 (Reference) (figure 4).
   Lichen simplex chronicus--In this localized disorder, repeated
scratching leads to a patch of chronic dermatitis that subsequently becomes
lichenified and takes on a thickened, barklike appearance (figure 5). The
patches of lichenified skin are intensely pruritic, leading to perpetuation
of the itch-scratch cycle.
   Lichen simplex chronicus seems to be precipitated by stress, depression,
and frustration. Some patients have a history of emotional or psychiatric
problems, but most often, the condition begins simply as a nervous habit.
   Nummular eczema--The elderly are most often affected by this form of
eczematous dermatitis. Lesions appear as coin-shaped eczematous plaques,
and pruritus is the primary symptom.
   Dyshidrotic eczema--This condition can be acute or chronic and is
characterized by sudden onset of pruritic vesicles followed by scaling,
fissures, and lichenification.3 (Reference) Dyshidrotic eczema most often
affects the hands (figure 6) and feet.
   Systemic disorders--Several chronic conditions may be characterized by
localized or generalized pruritus, including renal failure, cholecystitis,
cholestasis, diabetes mellitus, mastocytosis, hyperthyroidism,
hypothyroidism, polycythemia vera, iron deficiency, and malignant tumors.
Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to pruritus in these conditions are
ill-defined.1 (Reference)
miscellaneous disorders--Anogenital pruritus (eg, pruritus ani, scroti, and
vulvae) is a relatively common condition that is difficult to treat.
Pruritic patches of lichenified skin are self-perpetuating and may be
secondary to irritant dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, or infection.5
(Reference) Senile pruritus and aquagenic pruritus are idiopathic
conditions. Drug-induced eruptions can also result in bothersome pruritus.

Treatment methods
   Treatment of pruritus is directed at interruption of the destructive
itch-scratch cycle, control of the underlying condition, and relief of
cutaneous inflammation, if present (table 2). The most often prescribed
treatments for pruritus are oral antihistamines and topical
corticosteroids.
   Nonpharmacologic--Although some patients respond to nonpharmacologic
measures (eg, trimming the nails, using cool-water compresses, avoiding
irritants, behavior therapy), pharmacologic intervention is usually
required.
   Localized--Ultraviolet B phototherapy is effective in a wide variety of
pruritic conditions, although it is not very practical for most patients
and physicians.1,6 (Reference) In some situations, intralesional injections
of corticosteroids are useful.
   Systemic--Several classes of orally administered drugs can be effective
in relieving pruritus.
   Antihistamines--Histamine1 (H (subscript) 1) antagonists, such as
diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl) and hydroxyzine, are occasionally
beneficial against pruritus. However, this is an untargeted pharmacologic
approach; histamine receptors are blocked in both the central nervous
system and the periphery. As a result, somnolence is a common side effect
with antihistamines and can restrict their daytime use. To minimize these
effects, physicians routinely prescribe low-dose therapy, and whether this
provides adequate cutaneous histamine-receptor blockade to produce
localized antipruritic effects is questionable.
   Second-generation, nonsedating antihistamines (terfenadine [Seldane],
astemizole [Hismanal], loratadine [Claritin]) circumvent many of the
central nervous system effects associated with traditional antihistamines,
but studies of their use for pruritus have yielded inconsistent results.7
(Reference) Additionally, terfenadine and astemizole can cause serious
toxicity when given with certain macrolide antibiotics (eg, erythromycin)
and imidazole antifungals (eg, ketoconazole [Nizoral]). Ironically, this
finding has led some to suggest that success with the older agents may be
attributable to their sedative effects rather than to their peripheral
antihistamine properties.
   Corticosteroids--Corticosteroids (eg, prednisone, dexamethasone
[Decadron, Hexadrol]) are used only as a last resort or for temporary
control of a flare. Side effects preclude more extensive use.
   Topical--Several years ago, topical H (subscript) 1-receptor antagonists
were in widespread use. However, the discovery that the compounds were
associated with a high incidence of contact sensitization and
cross-reactivity has all but eliminated their use in dermatology.1,2
(Reference) Several of these agents (topical ``caine''-type anesthetics and
topical antihistamines) are still available, but their use should be
avoided. Several topical agents that are safer and more effective are now
available.
   Corticosteroids--Local application of low- to medium-potency
corticosteroids (eg, hydrocortisone, triamcinolone acetonide [Aristocort,
Flutex, Kenalog]) may be effective in moderately severe cases of
dermatitis. High-potency topical corticosteroids can be used for a short
period for more severe conditions. However, the antipruritic activity of
corticosteroids is secondary to their anti-inflammatory and
immunosuppressive properties. Even topical corticosteroid therapy can cause
undesirable local and systemic effects.
   In spite of cautions regarding skin atrophy and hypothalamic pituitary
axis suppression, some physicians continue to overuse and misuse topical
corticosteroids for many self-limiting disorders. Many physicians are
inclined, in an effort to provide rapid relief of pruritus, to prescribe
high-potency corticosteroids for conditions that normally respond to
lower-potency analogues. For treatment of pruritic dermatoses, an
antipruritic agent should be combined with the lowest-potency
corticosteroid that controls inflammation. This combination of agents often
provides quick symptomatic relief while maintaining a relatively high
margin of safety.
   Pramoxine formulations--Pramoxine hydrochloride (Itch-X, PrameGel,
Tronothane HCl) is a topical agent that seems to have an important role in
controlling mild to moderate pruritus, although frequent application is
usually required. Pramoxine is often combined with other agents (eg,
menthol, petrolatum, benzyl alcohol) to heighten effectiveness of the
formulation.
   Tricyclic compounds--These agents administered orally, in particular
doxepin hydrochloride (Adapin, Sinequan) and amitriptyline hydrochloride
(Elavil, Endep), have proven to have antipruritic properties in a variety
of conditions, notably chronic urticaria. The exact pharmacologic action
responsible for this effect is unknown but may be, in part, related to
their potent antagonistic properties at histamine-receptor sites. As with H
(subscript) 1 antihistamines, sedation may be problematic, however.
Tricyclic compounds are unique in their ability to block both histamine H
(subscript) 1 and H (subscript) 2 receptors. Doxepin's affinity for H
(subscript) 1 and H (subscript) 2 receptors exceeds that of other tricyclic
compounds and histamine-receptor antagonists, such as hydroxyzine and
diphenhydramine (which block H (subscript) 1 receptors) and cimetidine
(Tagamet) (which blocks H (subscript) 2 receptors).7-9 (Reference) Other
antipruritic mechanisms of doxepin may include antagonism of alpha
adrenoceptors and muscarinic and serotonin receptors (5-HT (subscript) 2
subtype), inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin neuronal reuptake, and
inhibition of the production of platelet-activating factor.7-13 (Reference)
In addition, orally administered doxepin decreases histamine-induced wheal
reactions.
   Unfortunately, orally administered tricyclic compounds are dose-limited
and poorly tolerated because of their anticholinergic and central nervous
system effects.14 (Reference) Therefore, topical application, which targets
the affected site and causes minimal side effects, is attractive. Solutions
of doxepin and amitriptyline have been shown experimentally to be effective
antipruritic agents.15 (Reference) Recently, 5% doxepin cream (Zonalon) was
introduced for treatment of pruritus. It differs from many other topical
antipruritics in that it has a low potential for sensitization reactions.
In addition, although some systemic absorption can occur, clinical
experience has shown that it is much better tolerated than the oral form of
doxepin.
   In two major clinical trials involving more than 500 patients with
moderate to severe pruritus secondary to eczematous dermatitis, those
treated with doxepin cream (as monotherapy) experienced rapid and
significant relief. Doxepin cream appeared to be equally effective for
atopic dermatitis, lichen simplex chronicus, contact dermatitis, and
nummular eczema.16 (Reference) In a preliminary report,17 (Reference)
doxepin cream was found to be an effective adjuvant to topical
corticosteroids. The only side effects reported were mild, temporary
drowsiness (for 1 to 2 days) and transient, local irritation at the site of
application.
   The possible roles of doxepin cream in treatment algorithms for pruritus
are numerous (table 2). In acute or self-limiting conditions, the agent
could be used instead of a corticosteroid to provide rapid relief as well
as safe and targeted treatment. In chronic conditions, concomitant use of
doxepin cream and topical corticosteroids could have a steroid-sparing
effect by allowing for the use of low-potency corticosteroids or shorter
treatment courses.
   Adjunctive--Emollients are sometimes used as monotherapy in mild
pruritus or as an adjunct in more severe cases. Tar compounds (eg, carbonis
detergens solutions, coal tar emulsions) can be efficacious when used along
with topical corticosteroids but are aesthetically objectionable.

Summary
   In several cutaneous disorders, pruritus is both the primary symptom and
the cause or perpetuating factor. Therefore, one focus of therapy should be
on treating pruritus and thereby preventing or aiding in the resolution of
skin lesions. Several treatment options are available, including
nonpharmacologic methods; use of emollients, tar preparations, and other
topical agents; ultraviolet B therapy; and use of oral antihistamines or
corticosteroids. A new topical tricyclic agent is now available that adds a
promising therapeutic approach.

THE MECHANISMS OF PRURITUS

   Biopsies of eczematous lesions in patients with chronic dermatitis
reveal increased density of nerve fibers and mast cells compared with
normal skin.1,2 (Reference) Studies have also found increased density of
nerve fibers in lichenified skin.3 (Reference) These alterations indicate a
significant primary or compensatory role of mast cells together with C
fibers in the pathophysiology of pruritus caused by dermatitis.
   Pruritic sensations arise from stimulation of nerve endings in the
dermoepidermal junction. They are transmitted as electrical impulses to the
central nervous system along unmyelinated C fibers (figure 1). When C
fibers are stimulated, they release substance P and other putative
neurotransmitters (calcitonin gene-related peptide, somatostatin,
neurokinins, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and glutamate) into synaptic
junctions at the spinal cord and into the extracellular milieu from
peripheral collateral nerve terminals.4,5 (Reference)
   C fibers often terminate in the skin close to cutaneous mast cells,
which contain potentially pruritic mediators, including histamine. Under
basal conditions, histamine is stored in granules within mast cells; its
release can be caused by various immunologic or nonimmunologic stimuli.
After release, histamine acts on H (subscript) 1 and H (subscript) 2
receptors in the skin to stimulate sensory nerve C fibers, cause cutaneous
vasodilation, and increase vascular permeability. These activities produce
pruritus accompanied by erythema and edema.4,5 (Reference)
   Other possible endogenous pruritic mediators are numerous. In general,
these substances can be considered (1) mast cell constituents, (2)
compounds causing pruritus secondary to mast cell stimulation and release
of histamine and other mediators that activate C fibers, or (3) compounds
that directly stimulate C fibers.

ACUTE BRONCHITIS

   Bronchitis is inflammation of the air passages (called the bronchial
tubes or the bronchi) that lead from the windpipe to the lungs. Acute
bronchitis comes on suddenly and lasts a short time. Another type, called
chronic bronchitis, lingers and often gets worse as years go by.

What causes acute bronchitis?
   Very often, what begins as a cold or influenza turns into bronchitis
when the virus spreads to the bronchial tubes. Sometimes the virus
responsible for a childhood disease, such as measles or whooping cough,
causes acute bronchitis at the same time or after the childhood disease has
passed. People whose lungs are already irritated, such as those who smoke,
breathe in a lot of pollution or dust, or have lung disease, are especially
susceptible to bronchitis.

What are the symptoms?
   Persistent coughing that brings up plentiful amounts of phlegm is
probably the most typical symptom. Inflammation makes the bronchial tubes
secrete sticky mucus, which your body tries to get rid of through coughing.
Since this sticky substance blocks the normal flow of air, you may have
trouble getting your breath or you may wheeze (make a whistling sound) when
you breathe. Pain behind your breastbone or in your back, especially when
you cough, is common. So is congestion in your chest and a mild fever.

Do I need to visit a doctor?
   Most times, acute bronchitis takes care of itself in a week or so.
Though it may get tiresome, coughing is nature's way of clearing the
secretions from your lungs, so try not to use cough medicine. If you feel
that you must (for example, to get some sleep), choose an expectorant,
which is a type of medicine that helps loosen the mucus from the bronchial
walls. Drinking lots of fluids thins the mucus and makes it less sticky so
it is easier to cough up.
Keeping the bronchial tubes moist by running a humidifier or taking steamy
showers may help you breathe more easily, and acetaminophen or aspirin
reduces fever.
   Most people start feeling better after following these measures for 3 or
4 days. If you do not improve or if you have a temperature of more than 101
degrees F, blood in the phlegm, or serious trouble breathing, see your
doctor.
If you have repeated attacks of acute bronchitis, mention them to your
doctor. They may lead to chronic bronchitis if not treated.

THE NEED FOR URGENT MANAGEMENT

By:
Joseph Varon, MD Robert E. Fromm Jr, MD, MPH

Preview
   Because hypertension is a common disorder in the United States, primary
care physicians may well see cases of hypertensive crisis. Patients may
present to the office or clinic as well as to the emergency department. In
this article, the authors emphasize the necessity of prompt recognition and
management of severe acute hypertension to limit end-organ damage.

   An estimated 60 million people in the United States have hypertension,
which is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disability and death.1
(Reference) The high prevalence of the condition makes it of great concern
to primary care physicians, who on occasion can expect to see cases of
hypertensive crisis.
   Fortunately, the incidence of hypertensive crises has decreased since
the 1940s, when hypertension was not considered a disease of major clinical
consequence. Indeed, it was viewed by many as an ``essential element'' to
force blood through sclerotic arteries to end-organs. The introduction of
effective pharmacologic treatment in the late 1940s decreased morbidity and
mortality associated with hypertension, and as a result it is currently
estimated that less than 1% of Americans with the condition are likely to
have hypertensive crises.2 (Reference)
   Recognition and management of hypertensive crises may be a challenge to
even the most astute clinician. Unlike the chronic risks conferred by
hypertension, these crises have the potential to be acutely
life-threatening,3,4 (Reference) and inadequate treatment increases both
morbidity and mortality.5 (Reference)

Definitions
   A myriad of terms have been applied to acute elevations in blood
pressure. Unfortunately, definitions have not always been uniform, and the
same clinical presentation may be included under more than one descriptive
heading. The following common definitions are provided to clarify our
subsequent discussions on recognition and management of patients with acute
elevations of blood pressure.
   Hypertensive crises. Situations resulting from elevated blood pressure
that are potentially life-threatening or organ-threatening
   Hypertensive emergencies. Clinical situations in which blood pressure
should be lowered within 1 hour to avoid serious end-organ damage
   Hypertensive urgencies. Elevations of blood pressure that can usually be
treated with antihypertensive agents to reduce pressure within 24 hours of
presentation
   Malignant hypertension. A syndrome characterized by elevated blood
pressure accompanied by encephalopathy or nephropathy or by papilledema
and/or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.4 (Reference) The term
``accelerated hypertension'' has been used to describe acute elevations of
blood pressure with hemorrhages or exudates on funduscopy. These syndromes
do not connote different clinical features or prognoses, and thus the term
``malignant-accelerated hypertension'' has been used.

Causes
   Common causes of hypertensive crises are shown in table 1. Most patients
who present with hypertensive crises have essential hypertension. In these
patients, the most common cause for acute elevation of blood pressure is
withdrawal from an antihypertensive drug (eg, clonidine).1-3 (Reference)

Diagnosis
   Hypertensive crisis is not defined by a specific blood pressure reading;
rather it is a clinical syndrome of end-organ disease that is associated
with acute elevations of blood pressure.5,6 (Reference) As is the case with
many other conditions in clinical practice, the diagnosis depends on the
results of history taking, physical examination, and laboratory testing.
After these initial evaluations, patients can be categorized into those
with hypertensive emergencies, those with hypertensive urgencies, and those
without evidence of end-organ damage.
   History taking--The primary focus of history taking in patients with
hypertensive crises is assessment of end-organ dysfunction (table 2). The
physician should obtain historical information on neurologic,
cardiovascular, and renal symptoms. Specific manifestations, such as
headaches, seizures, chest pain, dyspnea, and edema, should be ascertained.
In addition, a history of antihypertensive drug use and withdrawal should
be elicited, because as previously mentioned, abrupt discontinuation of
antihypertensive medications is one of the most common causes of
hypertensive crises.1,6 (Reference)
   Other medication use should also be examined. Prescription and
nonprescription drugs, including sympathomimetic or anticholinergic agents
(eg, decongestants, antidepressants) may produce acute elevations of blood
pressure. Previous and current drug abuse should also be noted; agents such
as amphetamines and cocaine may precipitate hypertensive crises. Some
herbal preparations may also elevate blood pressure.
   Physical examination--As in patients with any other critical illness,
physical examination starts with evaluation of the airway, breathing, and
circulation (ABCs) and is followed by assessment of mental status and level
of consciousness.6 (Reference) Blood pressure is measured in both arms with
a cuff of appropriate size. A standard sphygmomanometer should be used to
verify blood pressure levels in patients with readings outside normal
range. Automatic blood pressure recording devices may be inaccurate and
should not be routinely used when hypertensive crises are suspected.6
   All patients with elevated blood pressure should have a funduscopic
examination to detect papilledema, hemorrhages, or exudates. A careful
cardiovascular examination should be followed by complete neurologic
assessment to identify focal symptoms and signs.
   Laboratory studies--These are guided by the results of history taking
and physical examination. A complete blood cell count, measurement of
electrolytes and blood urea nitrogen, and urinalysis should be considered.
In addition, an electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and computed
tomographic scan of the head are obtained in selected patients with
evidence of chest pain, shortness of breath, or neurologic changes. It must
be emphasized that in many instances these tests are performed
simultaneously with the initiation of antihypertensive therapy.

Principles of management
   In the successful management of patients with hypertensive crises,
primum non nocere should be the rule. The initial goal of antihypertensive
therapy is not to achieve a normal blood pressure, but rather to gradually
decrease the mean arterial pressure to minimize the risk of hypoperfusion,
particularly in cerebral, coronary, and renal vascular beds.7 (Reference)
   Patients who present with hypertensive emergencies should be considered
critically ill and treated in an intensive care environment.6,8 (Reference)
They are placed at bed rest, and intravenous access is established for
administration of medication and fluid. Continuous blood pressure
monitoring, electrocardiographic readings, and frequent assessments of
neurologic status are routine. Continuous blood pressure monitoring is
achieved by placing intra-arterial lines. When properly applied, this
technique provides the most accurate and most frequently updated blood
pressure information.6,9 (Reference) We recommend intra-arterial line
placement in all patients who receive fast-acting, potent vasodilators (eg,
sodium nitroprusside).
   A reasonable approach for most patients with hypertensive emergencies is
to lower the mean arterial pressure by 25% over the initial 2 to 4 hours.1
(Reference) Some investigators recommend decreasing the diastolic blood
pressure to no less than 100 to 110 mm Hg because of the potential for
cerebral and coronary hypoperfusion.2,6 (Reference)

Specific agents
   A number of pharmacologic agents are available in the United States for
the management of hypertensive crises. As mentioned before, the appropriate
therapeutic approach depends on the form and clinical presentation. We
generally recommend short-acting parenteral agents for patients with
hypertensive crises (table 3).
   Sodium nitroprusside--Still one of the most commonly used agents for
hypertensive crises, especially in patients with documented severe,
long-standing chronic hypertension,10 (Reference) sodium nitroprusside
(Nitropress) stimulates the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and
relaxes vascular smooth muscle. The drug is very potent, and cerebral blood
flow may decrease in a dose-dependent manner. Onset of action is within
seconds, with a duration of 1 to 2 minutes and a plasma half-life of 3 to 4
minutes.11 (Reference) Blood pressure may rise abruptly when the drug is
stopped. Sodium nitroprusside is light-sensitive, and the infusion
reservoir should be covered.
   One of the main concerns in using sodium nitroprusside in clinical
practice is that it metabolizes into cyanogen and thiocyanate. Therefore,
in patients with acute or chronic renal failure, cyanide poisoning may
occur after prolonged administration. In most cases, toxic effects occur
after several days of infusion but may be seen within the first 24 hours of
high-dose administration (infusion rates higher than 2 mcg/kg per minute).
   Calcium-channel blockers--These agents have been used worldwide in the
treatment of acute hypertension.12 (Reference)
Nifedipine--Administration of 10 mg of nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia) every
5 minutes has been suggested by some investigators as an adequate form of
therapy in patients with hypertensive crises.1,3,4 (Reference) It is
important to mention that nifedipine is not absorbed through the buccal
mucosa and that patients should bite and swallow the medication rather than
use it sublingually.13 (Reference) Nifedipine causes arteriolar
vasodilatation and rapidly reduces systemic vascular resistance. Onset of
action is within 15 minutes of oral administration, and maximum effect
occurs at 30 minutes. A major word of caution: Administration of nifedipine
may precipitate ischemic events by sudden reduction in blood pressure.14
(Reference) In our experience, particular caution should be exercised in
patients with preexisting coronary artery disease.
   Nicardipine hydrochloride--An intravenous form of nicardipine (Cardene
I.V.) has been approved for treatment of acute severe hypertension in the
United States. This agent is a dihydropyridine derivative that differs from
nifedipine by addition of a tertiary amine structure in the ester side
chain. Because this makes nicardipine 100 times more water-soluble than
nifedipine, it can be administered intravenously.15 (Reference) In a recent
paper, Halpern and associates16 (Reference) reported on a multicenter,
prospective, randomized trial comparing the effect of this agent with that
of sodium nitroprusside in patients with severe postoperative hypertension.
They found nicardipine to be as effective as sodium nitroprusside.
   Nicardipine offers some unique advantages in the emergency treatment of
hypertensive crises. For example, it has been shown to reduce both cardiac
and cerebral ischemia.17 (Reference) In addition, its dose is not dependent
on the patient's weight. The manufacturer's recommendation for rapid
control of blood pressure is to give a continuous infusion that starts at 5
mg/hr and increases by 2.5 mg/hr every 5 minutes (maximum, 15 mg/hr) until
the desired reduction in blood pressure is achieved. Oral nicardipine
(Cardene), 20 mg, can also be given for hypertensive urgencies, and its
efficacy is similar to that of nifedipine.18 (Reference)
   Adrenergic-blocking agents--Three adrenergic-blocking agents may be
considered for hypertensive crises: esmolol hydrochloride (Brevibloc),
labetalol hydrochloride (Normodyne, Trandate), and phentolamine
(Regitine).
   Esmolol--This agent is a pure beta-adrenergic blocking agent that has an
extremely short half-life of less than 10 minutes. Esmolol can be
administered both as an intravenous bolus and as an infusion. The
recommended initial dose is 0.5 to 1 mg/kg, followed by infusion at 50 to
300 mcg/kg per minute.
   Labetalol--When given intravenously, this blocker of both alpha- and
beta-adrenergic receptors produces a prompt and controlled reduction of
blood pressure in patients with hypertensive crises.2,19 (Reference)
Antihypertensive effects start within 5 minutes of administration and may
last at least 4 to 6 hours. The fall in blood pressure results from a
combined decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a slight fall in
cardiac output. Initial parenteral treatment can be followed by oral
administration. A reasonable intravenous protocol is an initial bolus of
0.25 mg/kg, followed by larger boluses (0.5 mg/kg) every 15 minutes until
either blood pressure is controlled or a total dose of 3.25 mg/kg has been
given.
   Phentolamine--This adrenergic-blocking agent is used for management of
catecholamine-induced hypertensive crises. Intravenous administration of 5-
to 10-mg boluses is recommended.6,20 (Reference) The effect is immediate
and may last up to 15 minutes. Unfortunately, phentolamine may cause
tachyarrhythmias or angina, and its use is contraindicated in patients with
preexisting coronary artery disease. Once blood pressure is under control
with phentolamine, oral phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline), a long-acting
alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, may be given.
   Trimethaphan camsylate--A non-depolarizing ganglionic blocking drug,
trimethaphan (Arfonad) blocks transmission of impulses at the sympathetic
and parasympathetic ganglia.11 (Reference) The initial dose is 0.5 to 1
mg/min by continuous infusion, titrated to therapeutic effect. The agent is
potent and has numerous side effects. Tachyphylaxis is a common occurrence
and usually is seen within the first 2 days of administration.
   Diazoxide--Chemically related to the thiazide diuretics, diazoxide
(Hyperstat IV) directly relaxes the arteriolar smooth muscle and thus
reduces peripheral vascular resistance.21 (Reference) When urgent treatment
is required, diazoxide is given intravenously. The onset of action is
immediate, with peak action at 5 to 10 minutes and total duration of action
ranging from 3 to 18 hours.11 (Reference) The current recommended dose is a
minibolus of 1 to 3 mg/kg (to a maximum 150-mg single dose) injected over
10 to 15 seconds. It was previously believed that larger doses (ie, 300 mg)
were needed for therapeutic effect because this agent is 90% protein-bound.
However, larger doses were associated with severe hypotension in up to 10%
of patients. Diazoxide has other significant side effects that additionally
limit its use; salt and water retention is commonly seen, and hyperglycemia
and hyperuricemia may be significant.
   Clonidine--Oral clonidine (Catapres), 0.1 mg every 20 minutes (to a
maximum of 0.8 mg), has been used for the treatment of hypertensive crises,
particularly hypertensive urgencies.22 (Reference) Oral ``loading'' allows
a smooth, rapid, predictable reduction of blood pressure.23 Sedation is a
common side effect and may be a useful adjunct in some patients. In our
experience, this medication is an excellent choice when blood pressure
control within a few hours is desired.6 (Reference)
   Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors--Captopril (Capoten) is the
prototype of these agents and has been compared with several other agents
for treatment of hypertensive crises. In a study by Angeli and
associates,24 (Reference) the effects of sublingual captopril were compared
with those of nifedipine, and it was found that sublingual captopril could
be effectively used as an alternative to nifedipine. The effects of
sublingual captopril occur within 5 minutes of its administration and
persist for about 4 hours.
   Intravenous enalapril maleate (Vasotec I.V.) is now gaining popularity
for use in hypertensive crises.25,26 (Reference) In our experience, initial
intravenous treatment followed by oral administration is a safe means of
management.
   Other agents--A number of other agents are used for hypertensive crises,
including nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid IV, Nitrostat) and hydralazine
hydrochloride (Apresoline). Reserpine (Serpasil), methyldopa (Aldomet), and
guanethidine monosulfate (Ismelin) have largely been replaced by newer
agents and in our experience have no role in current treatment of
hypertensive crises.
   Nitroglycerin--Although nitroglycerin has disadvantages, including
unpredictable antihypertensive effects, it may have a significant role in
patients with coronary artery disease.6 (Reference) It is still widely used
because it is inexpensive when compared with other agents.
   Hydralazine--This agent is an arteriolar vasodilator that is commonly
used in pregnancy-related hypertensive crises. It may cause marked reflex
tachycardia and increase myocardial oxygen demand, which can lead to
anginal symptoms in patients who have preexisting coronary artery disease.

Special diagnostic and treatment situations
   Hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, and myocardial ischemia
present special management considerations in patients with hypertensive
crises.
   Hypertensive encephalopathy--The central nervous system is one target
organ that is damaged by acute elevations in blood pressure. The cerebral
vasculature constricts and dilates as necessary to maintain a relatively
constant level of cerebral blood flow. This process, also known as
autoregulation, protects the brain from changing levels of systemic blood
pressure.27 (Reference) However, significant elevations of blood pressure
overcome the homeostatic process and lead to cerebral hyperperfusion and
the development of cerebral edema. Chronic elevations of blood pressure
shift the entire regulatory curve to the right.
   The manifestations of hypertensive encephalopathy may be those of focal
or diffuse cerebral dysfunction. In the management of this hypertensive
emergency, attention must be paid to the rate of decrease in blood pressure
in order to avoid cerebral ischemic complications. Although drugs such as
clonidine have been used in these patients, we prefer intravenous
titratable agents.6,28 (Reference)
   Aortic dissection--About 80% of patients who develop aortic dissection
have a history of hypertension. The mechanism of aortic dissection involves
not only elevations of blood pressure per se but also pressure waves
associated with the pulsatile waveform of systemic blood pressure.29
(Reference) The rate at which the pressure wave rises is important to the
propagation of aortic dissection and an important factor to consider in its
treatment. Physicians who treat aortic dissection should administer agents
that not only reduce the mean arterial pressure but also reduce the rate at
which pressure rises. Classically, vasodilators have been used with the
addition of beta blockers; more recently, beta blockers with vasodilatory
properties have been advised. Some investigators still advocate the use of
ganglionic-blocking agents for this disorder.
   Myocardial ischemia--Acute elevations of blood pressure may result in an
imbalance between oxygen demand and supply in the coronary circulation and
in the development of ischemia. Thus, in patients with acute myocardial
infarction or unstable angina, acute blood pressure elevations may be
deleterious and should be managed promptly. Nitrates, which have been a
mainstay of therapy for myocardial ischemia for a number of reasons,
including their ability to dilate vessels of the coronary bed, are also
efficacious for the management of hypertension and may have a special place
in the treatment of this syndrome.6 (Reference)

Summary
   Although hypertensive crises are now relatively uncommon, they often are
life-threatening when they do occur and demand early recognition and
management to minimize morbidity and mortality. Most patients have
essential hypertension, and withdrawal from an antihypertensive drug is the
most common cause of acute elevation of blood pressure.
   Short-acting parenteral agents are generally recommended for management
of hypertensive crises. In most patients with hypertensive emergencies, the
mean arterial pressure is lowered 25% over 2 to 4 hours. Both cerebral and
coronary hypoperfusion must be avoided.

FOUL-SMELLING TODDLERS

By:
Rashmi R. Abhyankar, MD, Terre Haute, Indiana

   Toddlers have a tendency to push objects up their nose. When a small
child is brought in for investigation of a foul odor of recent onset,
inspect both of his or her nostrils well and ask if any foreign bodies have
been noted before you make a referral or prescribe antibiotics.

IS IT ULCERATIVE COLITIS?

By:
Monjur Ahmed, MD, Kew Gardens, New York

   Amebic colitis may mimic or precipitate an attack of ulcerative colitis.
Therefore, the stool should be examined for Entamoeba histolytica in any
patient with an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis before prescribing
corticosteroids, which disseminate this organism. The presence of E
histolytica trophozoites in a fresh stool specimen justifies treatment with
metronidazole.

APICAL EXAMINATION FOR LEFT VENTRICULAR ENLARGEMENT

By:
Arup Achari, MD, Houston

   Precordial examination is often considered less important than an
electrocardiogram (ECG) or a chest film in the evaluation of left
ventricular size and volume. However, an impulse of more than 3 cm in
diameter during palpation of the apex with the patient in the left lateral
decubitus position is 92% as sensitive and 91% as specific as an
echocardiogram in indicating left ventricular enlargement* and is far
superior to the ECG and chest film for this purpose.
   The normal apical impulse covers an area of about 1 cm (the size of a
penny). If the area is more than that of your stethoscope (about 3 cm), you
can be fairly sure that the patient has an enlarged left ventricle.

BURNS FROM DEFIBRILLATION

By:
I. K. Parikh, MD, Cincinnati

   At an advanced cardiac life support meeting I attended at a local

defibrillation procedure. This happened because the patient had been
sponged with tepid alcohol to lower his temperature before cardiac arrest
occurred.

D NJ JURY FINDS NO DEFECT IN ABSENCE OF KEYBOARD WARNING

     A 10-member federal district court jury in Trenton, NJ, on
Dec. 22 found that a plaintiff had not shown that the defendant's
keyboard was defective due to the absence of a warning that using
it could cause repetitive stress injuries.  Oliver v. AT&T
Teletype Corp., No. 93-1806 (D NJ).

     Plaintiff Janet C. Oliver, a service representative with New
Jersey Bell, had used an AT&T keyboard in her employment since
1980.  She filed a complaint in New Jersey Superior Court, Mercer
County, on Dec. 18, 1992, maintaining that AT&T was negligent in
failing to warn "of the dangers and hazards of the [keyboard],
and the dangers posed to the health and welfare of those coming
in contact with or using the [keyboard]."  Oliver also advanced a
theory of strict products liability, claiming that she suffered
her injury "[a]s a proximate result of the defective, unfit,
unsuitable, unsafe and unreasonably dangerous condition of the
[keyboard]."  Oliver sought compensatory and punitive damages.

     The litigation was removed to the U.S. District Court for
the District of New Jersey on April 26, 1993.  The trial went to
the jury before Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. on Dec. 5.

     The jury, in reaching its verdict, answered "no" to the
question, "Do you find that AT&T's keyboard was defective due to
the absence of a warning that the product could cause the type of
injuries claimed by the plaintiff?"  Apparently the jury did not
accept the testimony of Oliver's expert witness, Dr. Sandra Mohr,
linking repetitive stress injury to keyboard use.

     In a May 30, 1995, order, Magistrate Judge John J. Hughes
barred evidence in the nature of Bureau of Labor Statistics data
regarding the proliferation of repetitive stress syndrome
excepting through testimonial reference.  Judge Hughes opined
that the prejudice to AT&T resulting from the admission of such
evidence far outweighed its probative value.  Judge Hughes did
allow evidence pertaining to workers' compensation claims filed
by AT&T employees based on keyboard use, as well as evidence of
alternative keyboard designs and warnings utilized by other
manufacturers.

     Oliver was represented by Moshe Maimon of Levy Phillips &
Konigsberg in New York City; and by Bill Mathesius of Szafer,
Lakind, Blumstein, Walter & Bader in Lawrenceville, NJ.  AT&T was
represented by Ira Greenberg and Andrew Fishkin of Edwards &
Angell in New York City.

D RI PLAINTIFFS' COUNSEL CITES REASONS FOR MISTRIAL MOTION

     Citing the lack of a "level playing field" in the
presentation of the parties' cases, counsel for an RSI plaintiff
whose jury trial ended with a verdict adverse to her cause filed,
on Dec. 11, an affidavit supporting his motions for a new trial
and a mistrial.  Piester v. IBM Corp., No. 94-470 (D RI).

     Counsel for plaintiffs Patricia and Richard Piester, Steven
J. Phillips, based his motion on his belief that "the Court at
critical junctures displayed what appeared to be an animus toward
plaintiffs' cause generally, and toward [plaintiffs' counsel]
especially."  Furthermore, Phillips asserts that Judge Raymond J.
Pettine evidenced "an unmistakable approach of extreme liberality
favoring all proofs and scheduling needs desired by defendant and
harsh restrictiveness with respect to plaintiffs' proofs and
scheduling needs."  These "simply cannot be squared with any
notion of basic fairness," Phillips argues.

     For example, Phillips cites what he alleges is a disparity
in the approach taken by Judge Pettine to the parties in pretrial
proceedings.  Phillips asserts that Judge Pettine "promptly
forgave" IBM's failure to timely file a pretrial memorandum.
Judge Pettine reopened discovery and otherwise let IBM "prepare
for trial at a time after plaintiffs had already filed their
pretrial memo," Phillips says.  Phillips avers that this
contrasts greatly with Judge Pettine's order finding inadmissible
the testimony of plaintiffs' expert witnesses, Dr. Laura Welch
and Dr. Laura Punnett.

     Phillips asserts that IBM ignored Judge Pettine's
admonishment to raise "serious" issues in limine prior to trial
by not raising the admissibility issue until after the trial
began.  "This tactic was richly successful, without once the
Court questioning why IBM had waited so long without waiving its
rights," Phillips says.

     Phillips cites a number of examples of what he claims were
Judge Pettine's unequal treatment of the parties during trial
proceedings.  Phillips says that he was told by Judge Pettine
that there would be no time set for openings, yet he asserts that
Judge Pettine suddenly imposed a time limit while his opening was
in progress.

     Phillips also avers that he was frequently admonished to
"get to the point" while he was trying to lay the foundation of
the plaintiffs' case.  "In essence, the Court was mercilessly
rushing plaintiffs and preventing the careful laying of
foundations and bases for opinions on the one hand and then
sustaining objections for failing to lay such foundations on the
other," Phillips says.

     This contrasts with the latitude given IBM in its
questioning of Patricia Piester, Phillips says.  He says that
"the record will reveal that IBM counsel was given an
unbelievable and unfettered freedom to make speeches and testify
rather than ask questions throughout these proceedings."

     "It is not plaintiffs' belief that the Court intended [to
deny a fair trial] or consciously acted with any impropriety,"
says  Phillips, but he argued that that is precisely what
occurred.

     According to the original complaint, Patricia Piester used
an IBM keyboard in her employment as a medical secretary for a
Providence medical practice.  She began to experience numbness
and tingling in her upper extremities in August 1990 and
underwent carpal tunnel surgery in January 1991.

     The jury in the Piester trial said on Oct. 20 that the
plaintiff did not prove that a computer keyboard manufactured by
IBM was a proximate cause of her repetitive stress injuries.

     On Oct. 16, prior to the jury's verdict, Judge Pettine ruled
on the admissibility of the testimony of Welch, a medical doctor,
and Punnett, an occupational epidermologist and ergonomist.
Judge Pettine ruled that Welch had sufficient knowledge and
scientific foundation, under the standard of Daubert v. Merrell
Dow Pharmaceuticals, 113 S.Ct. 2786 (1993), to testify on the
cause of Piester's injuries and on whether IBM's keyboard was
unreasonably dangerous.  However, the judge found her not
qualified to opine on the value of keyboard warnings in
preventing injury or on the desirability of alternative keyboard
designs.

     As to Punnett, Judge Pettine said that her testimony "lacks
the required scientific reliability mandated by Daubert and
presents the conundrum of how you bridge the gap from subjective
symptoms and objective signs to a defined disease."  Judge
Pettine found Punnett's testimony inadmissible, observing that
"Dr. Punnett is not an M.D. and yet she jumps from symptoms to
disease.  I find that bridging this hiatus is dependent on
medical expertise."

     Attorneys for Piester were Steven J. Phillips of Levy
Phillips & Konigsberg, New York City; Robert Corrente of
Corrente, Brill & Kusinitz, Providence; and Mark C. Hadden of
Gidley, Sarli & Marusak, Providence.  IBM was represented by
Michael A. Cerussi Jr. and Joseph A. D'Avanzo of Cerussi &
Spring, White Plains, NY; and by Matthew F. Madeiros of Flanders
& Madeiros, Providence.

DC FED. COURT CONSIDERS PLAINTIFFS' PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION
OBLIGATIONS

     The defendants in a repetitive stress injury product
liability action filed separate briefs Dec. 11 opposing the
plaintiff's motion to compel further discovery.  Fort et al. v.
IBM et al., No. 95-20 (D DC).

     The defendants say that the plaintiff has no ground for
further discovery in light of her failure to provide required
specific product identification information to the defendants.

     In its brief, defendant NEC Technologies points out that to
date "no product identification information concerning NEC
Technologies has been produced by [Fort]."  This is so despite
Fort's being ordered by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson to present
this information by June 30, 1995, says NEC.  NEC says that it is
not obligated to respond to Fort's interrogatories because the
disputed facts at issue had not been alleged with particularity.
NEC argues that Fort's latest filing is nothing more than an
attempt to forestall court action on the defendants' Sept. 7
motion to dismiss based on Fort's failure to produce product
identification information.

     NEC maintains that FRCP 26(a)(1) is inapplicable to the
instant litigation, pursuant to Local Rule 207(a), since it had
been assigned to the "complex track" by mutual consent of the
parties.  Under Local Rule 207(a), the burden is on the parties
"to make specific discovery requests to obtain the information
and material that is truly relevant...," says NEC.  Fort has not
demonstrated how additional discovery will help it meets its
product identification burden, adds NEC.

     The opposition filed by IBM largely echoes the sentiments of
its co-defendant NEC on the applicability of FRCP 26(a)(1), the
validity of Fort's interrogatories and Fort's delays in providing
product identification information.  In addition, IBM asserts
that Fort seeks "to shift the burden of product identification to
IBM in an attempt to avoid the results of the failure of their
own efforts."

     IBM and NEC filed their briefs in response to Fort's Nov. 29
motion to compel discovery.  In that motion, Fort argued that the
defendants have done "nothing to meet their obligations under
Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1) to disclose information within their
control which would permit the identification of the keyboards
and terminals used...."  Fort maintained that the defendants,
even accounting for Local Rule 207(a), were obligated to disclose
information pertaining to, among others things, (1) the types of
equipment sold to her employer, the Chesapeake & Potomac
Telephone Co. (C&P); (2) sales information relevant to the
products; and (3) sales and maintenance contracts with C&P.

               Fort noted that she had served a second set of
interrogatories in an attempt to moot the defendants' refusal to
comply with FRCP 26(a)(1), but that the defendants have filed
objections to these interrogatories.

     In the alternative, Fort asked that should the court find
the defendants exempt from FRCP 26(a)(1), and from responding to
the second set of interrogatories, that she be granted leave to
file more interrogatories and requests for production of
documents.  "Otherwise, plaintiffs will effectively have been
denied any discovery on product identification because an oral
determination by the Court placing the case on a complex track
had the unintended retroactive effect of terminating discovery
which the Federal Rules contemplate plaintiffs should have as a
matter of right," Fort said.

     On Dec. 18, Fort filed a reply in support of her motion to
compel discovery, disputing IBM's and NEC's categorizations of
her obligation to provide product identification information.
Fort says that the order issued by U.S. Magistrate Judge John L.
Caden of the Eastern District of New York, the court from which
the instant litigation was transferred, called for her to provide
product identification information only to the extent known.
That order clearly rejected the defendants' argument that product
identification must include model and serial numbers, Fort said.
Fort argues that "[t]he model and serial numbers of [defendants']
19th century-style keyboards is irrelevant or at best marginally
relevant to repetitive stress/carpal tunnel syndrome injuries."

     Most recently, on Dec. 29, IBM filed a motion to strike
Fort's reply of Dec. 18.  IBM argues that the memo should be
stricken because it did not address Fort's earlier motion to
compel discovery, but instead raised issues that were immaterial
to that motion.  IBM contends that Fort improperly used the reply
memo "to oppose the defendants' motion to dismiss " even though
that opposition had already been filed on Sept. 21, 1995."

     Fort filed her complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of New York on March 25, 1993, seeking
compensatory and punitive damages for the repetitive stress
injuries she allegedly incurred while using certain typewriter
and computer equipment while working for C&P.  The complaint
named IBM as the manufacturer of the typewriter equipment and NEC
and AT&T Corp. as the manufacturers of the computer equipment.
The case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia on April 20, 1994.

     Counsel for Fort is Bardyl R. Tirana, Washington DC.
Counsel for IBM are J. Hardin Marion, John B. Isbister and
Stephen Weissman of Tydings and Rosenberg, Baltimore.  Counsel
for NEC are James E. Gray and Colleen Rathbun of Goodell,
DeVries, Leech & Gray, L.L.P., also in Baltimore.

ND GA JUDGE SAYS PLAINTIFF NEEDED TO CITE ALTERNATIVE DESIGN

     U.S. District Judge Frank M. Hull of the Northern District
of Georgia on Dec. 7 granted summary judgment in favor of the
manufacturer of a check encoding machine in the product liability
case brought by a bank employee who asserted that the machine had
caused her repetitive stress injuries.  Little v. NCR Corp.,
No. 93-1555 (ND GA).

     Gwenette Little began working for Wachovia Bank in December
1986 as an encoder operator.  According to her complaint, she
began to experience pain and swelling in her hands in
August 1991.  She was diagnosed with overuse syndrome in January
1992 and with carpal tunnel syndrome in December 1992.  Little
attributed her condition to her use of the encoding machine
manufactured by NCR.  In her job, Little fed a check into a
machine track with her left hand while typing on a keypad with
her right hand.

     Little's July 8, 1993, complaint alleged seven causes of
action: (1) breach of implied warranty of merchantability;
(2) breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular
purpose; (3) breach of express warranty; (4) strict liability;
(5) negligent design; (6) failure to warn; and (7) gross
negligence in the failure to warn.  Little sought actual and
punitive damages as well as special damages in the amount of
$1 million.

     First, Judge Hull agreed with NCR's argument that Little's
complaint was time-barred under Georgia's two-year statute of
limitations.  While Little argued that her cause of action did
not accrue until she was diagnosed with overuse syndrome in early
1992, Judge Hull noted that "Georgia law requires only that
[Little] knew or should have known through reasonable diligence
that she was injured and that [NCR's] conduct caused the injury."
Since her doctor had suggested that her problems with her hands
were likely related to her job, Little was aware of the likely
cause of her injuries more than two years prior to filing her
complaint, said Judge Hull.

     In addition to lack of timely filing, the judge indicated
that there were other grounds to grant NCR's motion for summary
judgment.

     Judge Hull said that summary judgment in favor of NCR was
appropriate with respect to Little's strict liability and
negligent design claims, since Little failed to meet her burden
to show defect and causation.

     The judge agreed with NCR that the testimony of Little's
expert witness, Dr. Ruston M. Hunt, was inadmissible because it
was not reliable under the U.S. Supreme Court's teaching in
Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 113 S.Ct. 2786, 2795
(1993).  Judge Hull said that Hunt's testimony "suffers from not
just unreliable methodology, but the complete absence of any
discernible methodology."

     The judge noted that Hunt: (1) had no experience with
encoding machine design; (2) had never conducted original
research into overuse syndrome nor had he published or testified
on that topic; (3) had spent only 10 to 12 hours on forming his
expert opinion prior to being deposed; and (4) had never met
Little or her physicians nor had he seen her workstation.

     Judge Hull rebuffed Little's attempt to support her claim
with statistical evidence showing a purportedly high incidence of
overuse syndrome among encoder operators.  She stated that
Little's use of statistical evidence "does not raise a genuine
issue on the elements of (1) defect in the check-encoding
machine, and (2) causation between a defect in the check encoding
machine and [Little's] injury."

     Judge Hull granted NCR's motion for summary judgment also
with respect to Little's claim of breach of express warranty.  He
noted that under Georgia law, "an express warranty extends only
to the original purchaser, unless the warranty 'makes it clear
that it is also intended to extend to some identifiable third
party or parties'" (quoting Stewart v. Gainesville Glass Co.,
Inc., 131 Ga.App. 747 [1974]).  Here, there is nothing in NCR's
sales agreement with Little's employer, Wachovia Bank, "that any
warranties extend to [Little], as an employee," said Judge Hull.

     Little's failure to warn theory of liability also fell
victim to NCR's motion for summary judgment.  Judge Hull found
summary judgment in favor of NCR to be appropriate, as Little
"has not produced evidence on defect and causation."  Further,
Judge Hull noted that Little's suggestions on an appropriate
warning, i.e., "maintaining proper posture," did not relate to
the encoding machine but related to Little's job.

     Judge Hull offered yet another basis to enter summary
judgment in favor of NCR.  He found that Little failed to meet
her burden, under Georgia law, to "produce proof to a reasonable
degree of medical certainty that [her] injury resulted from her
use of [NCR's] machine."

     Finally, Judge Hull said that Little's suit must fail due to
her failure to propose an alternative design for the encoder.
Following the "risk-utility analysis" set forth in Banks v. ICI
Americas, Inc., 264 Ga. 732, 734-37 (1994), an alternative design
is one factor in determining whether a product's utility
outweighs the risks inherent in its design, noted Judge Hull.
Absent an alternative, Judge Hull concluded that Little did not
show that NCR's "design choice" was unreasonable.

     When contacted by the Repetitive Stress Injury LR, NCR's co-
counsel, Max Hess, opined that adoption of the "alternative
design" requirement would make it much harder for RSI plaintiffs
"down the road."

     Little's breach of implied warranty claims were dismissed by
an earlier order filed by Judge Hull on Feb. 22, 1995.  He ruled
that Little's lack of privity to NCR's sales contract with
Wachovia barred recovery under breach of warranty.  Also
dismissed at that time was Little's allegation that NCR was
grossly negligent in its duty to warn and, by extension, Little's
claim for punitive damages.  Judge Hull noted that, under Georgia
law, punitive damages are available only for "willful misconduct,
malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want of
care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference
to consequences."

     While Little alleged that NCR "intentionally failed to
warn," Judge Hull observed that Little's allegations "do not rise
to the level of conscious indifference of the consequences so as
to support [her] prayer for punitive damages."

     Representing Little was Armando Rois-Mendez, Duluth, GA.
Representing NCR were Max Hess and John Taylor of Vincent,
Chorey, Taylor & Feil, Atlanta.

CAUSE OF ACTION DID NOT ACCRUE FROM SYMPTOM ONSET, ARGUES
PLAINTIFF

     The question of whether her action is time-barred is not
proper for summary judgment, repetitive stress injury plaintiff
Bernice Bush says in her Dec. 18 memorandum in opposition to
defendant IBM's motion for summary judgment.  Smith et al. v.
Memorex Corp. et al., No. 94-1163 (D DC).

     In her Dec. 21 response to IBM's motion to dismiss for
failure to allow complete discovery, Bush maintains that she "has
not deliberately failed to respond."

     Bush argues that since she "continued to use [IBM's]
products during the three-year period prior to filing her action,
and because she has sustained new injuries caused by her use of
those products in that three-year period, her claim is timely
under New York law."

     Bush rejects IBM's argument that her cause of action accrued
from the date she first experienced symptoms of injury.  This
issue is not settled in New York, Bush says, citing cases pending
before New York courts.

     Bush also argues that summary judgment is inappropriate in
this case.  Quoting Ford v. AT&T, 154 Misc.2d 894, 586 N.Y.S.2d
721, 724 (NY Sup. Ct., New York Cty. 1992), Bush asserts that the
question of whether symptoms noticed before a diagnosis was made
"were indications of the existence of the diagnosed [injury]," is
purely a question of fact to be resolved by a jury.
Additionally, Bush claims that she "did not experience a single
injury, but rather an accumulation of injuries through the period
of her use of the defendant's equipment."  Each of these
subsequent injuries "gives rise to a new cause of action," Bush
contends.

     Bush also cites "the aggravation of pre-existing injuries
during the same period" in support of the timeliness of her
action.  "It is well-settled in New York that defendant may be
held liable to plaintiff not only for causing injury, but for the
aggravation of a pre-existing condition," Bush says.

     Bush discounts IBM's reliance on Wallen v. AT&T,
No. 12336/91 (NY Sup. Ct., Bronx Cty., Sept. 17, 1992), and its
progeny in support of its proposition that a cause of injury
accrues from the onset of symptoms.  "In Wallen, onset of
symptoms were never discussed and only uncontested dates of
diagnoses were considered for accrual purposes," says Bush.  In
this case, "where diagnosis and symptom onset are explicitly
different and unlinked," Wallen is not controlling, Bush says.

     Finally, Bush asserts that her claim is timely under New
York's discovery statute, C.P.L.R. Section 214-c, which states,
in pertinent part:

     ...the three year period within which an action to
     recover damages for personal injury or injury to
     property caused by the latent effects of exposure to
     any substance or combination of substances, in any
     form...shall be computed from the date of discovery of
     the injury by the plaintiff...

     Bush maintains that this statute applies because she "did
not discover, and should not have discovered, the nature or cause
of any of her new injuries until she was diagnosed with them
during the three-year period prior to filing suit."

     Anticipating IBM's possible response to her statutory
argument, Bush denies that C.P.L.R. Section 214-c is applicable
only to injuries stemming from exposure to toxic substances.
Bush cites the court in DiMarco v. Hudson Valley Blood Services,
147 A.D.2d 156, 542 N.Y.S.2d 521 (1st Dept. 1989) as emphasizing
that it applies to injuries from the "latent effects of exposure
to any substance or combination of substances, in any form."

     In her response to the motion to dismiss, Bush contends that
she has answered all questions regarding her medical history to
the best of her ability.  In addition, she maintains that she has
provided IBM with medical records and information about her
medical expenses and wages lost.

     Bush further asserts that an upcoming expert report "will
provide a basis for establishing IBM's liability."  IBM, says
Bush, has been in possession of an affidavit that lists
"documents that support [her] claims for punitive damages, strict
liability and negligence."

     "The documents set forth...were either produced by IBM
itself in other litigation or provided to IBM in other
litigation," says Bush.  "IBM, therefore, is fully aware of the
facts set forth in those documents and their relationship to its
liability in this matter," she adds.

     Bush was one of several individuals to file product
liability actions against a number of computer equipment
manufacturers in the Eastern District of New York on April 5,
1993.  Bush seeks compensatory and punitive damages, alleging
that her repetitive stress injuries were caused by her use of
computer equipment manufactured by defendant IBM and others while
she was employed by the Potomac Electric Power Co.  Her claim, as
well as that of lead plaintiff Joan P. Smith and another
plaintiff, was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia on May 27, 1994.

     IBM moved for summary judgment on Dec. 6, arguing that
Bush's complaint was untimely filed.  IBM asserted that New
York's three-year statute of limitations is controlling and,
citing to Wallen and In re New York County Data Entry Workers
Litigation, No. 499000/93 (NY Sup. Ct., New York Cty., Aug. 17,
1994), argued that a repetitive stress injury plaintiff's cause
of action accrues from the onset of symptoms.  IBM argued that
both Bush's medical records and her own deposition indicate that
she had symptoms of repetitive stress injury as early as March
1985, some eight years prior to filing suit.

     IBM also filed a motion to dismiss, maintaining that Bush's
response to Magistrate Judge Deborah A. Robinson's order to
compel Bush to respond to discovery was "woefully inadequate."
In the motion, IBM argued that it still lacked "(1) any evidence
of wrongdoing on the part of IBM; (2) a complete medical history
of the plaintiff; and (3) an itemized list of the damages at
issue."

     Counsel for Bush are Marc P. Weingarten and Kim Palavoy
Kutler of Greitzer and Locks in Philadelphia; and Bardyl R.
Tirana, Washington, DC.  Counsel for IBM are John B. Isbister and
Jennifer Holmes of Tydings & Rosenberg in Baltimore.

D NJ DECLINES TO APPLY DISCOVERY EXCEPTION TO CAUSE OF ACTION
ACCRUAL

     In a letter opinion filed Dec. 12, U.S. District Judge
Nicholas H. Politan of the District of New Jersey granted summary
judgment in favor of manufacturers of the computer equipment
cited as the cause of a plaintiff's repetitive stress injuries.
Sprueill v. NCR Corp. et al., No. 94-2233 (D NJ).
               The judge held that the complaint was time-barred under New
York's three-year statute of limitations.

     In their motions for summary judgment, defendants NCR Corp.,
Applied Digital Data Systems, an NCR subsidiary, and Hazeltine,
Inc. argued that since plaintiff Mary Sprueill admitted to having
ceased using their equipment more than three years before she
filed her complaint, the complaint was clearly untimely.

     Sprueill argued that the complaint was timely with respect
to these defendants because it was filed within one year of her
discovery of the defendants' fault in causing her injuries.
However, Judge Politan disagreed.  Citing to Wallen v. AT&T,
No. 12336/91 (NY Sup. Ct., Bronx Cty., Sept. 17, 1992), Judge
Politan held that the discovery exception to the statute of
limitations is not applicable to repetitive stress injury claims.
Also rejected was Sprueill's argument that her claim was timely
under the theory of a continuing duty to warn.  "This theory has
repeatedly been rejected by courts," Judge Politan said.

     Defendants Digital Equipment Corp. and Wyse Technology moved
for summary judgment as well, arguing that Sprueill's action
against them was also time-barred because her cause of action
accrued from the date of injury or symptoms of injury.  Sprueill
admitted to having pain as early as 1979, noted the defendants.

     Sprueill argued against summary judgment on the basis that
she had suffered new injuries during the statutory period that
were qualitatively different from her prior injuries.  Sprueill
cited the certification of Dr. Sandra N. Mohr to the effect that
she had been diagnosed with tenosynovitis in her right fingers,
flexor tenosynovitis of the wrists, and ulnar neuritis within the
last three years.

     However, Judge Politan found Mohr's certification to be
inadequate to deflect the defendants' motions for summary
judgment.

     "Dr. Mohr...never examined plaintiff before August of 1991,"
said Judge Politan.  "Additionally, Dr. Mohr admits that there
were no medical records in existence prior to Oct. 9, 1989, which
she could have reviewed regarding plaintiff's injuries," he
added.  "Hence, the certification is based on Dr. Mohr's pure
speculation, rather than any relevant medical facts," Judge
Politan concluded.

     Sprueill filed her complaint in the U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of New York on March 29, 1993.  In the
complaint, Sprueill contends that her use of computer equipment
manufactured by the defendants during her employment was the
cause of her cervical radiculopathy, bilateral carpal tunnel
syndrome, and trigger finger syndrome.

     The complaint cites causes of action in negligence and
strict products liability.  Sprueill asserts that she used
computer equipment manufactured by Unisys Corp. (formerly
Burroughs Corp.) until 1970; equipment manufactured by NCR until
1979; equipment manufactured by Applied until 1989; equipment
manufactured by Hazeltine until 1989; equipment manufactured by
Wyse through 1990; and equipment manufactured by Digital until
1991.  Sprueill's action was transferred to the U.S. District
Court for the District of New Jersey on April 20, 1994.  Unisys
Corp. was dismissed as a defendant by order of Aug. 7, 1995.

     Counsel for Sprueill was Arnold Carl Lakind of Szaferman,
Lakind, Blumstein, Watter & Blader, P.C., Lawrenceville, NJ.
Counsel for NCR and Applied was Lynne J. Urbanowicz of Edwards &
Angell, Newark, NJ.  Counsel for Hazeltine was Thomas R. Curtin
of Ribis, Graham, Verdon & Curtin, Morristown, NJ.  Counsel for
Wyse was Michael J. Tartini of Minichino & Mautone, P.A.  Counsel
for Digital was Peter Russell Freed of Smith, Stratton, Wise,
Heher & Brennan, Princeton, NJ.

EEOC SAYS RSI SCREENING TESTS VIOLATED ADA

     The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has accused
Rockwell International Corp. of violating the Americans with
Disabilities Act by conducting pre-employment testing designed to
screen out applicants with repetitive stress injuries and other
disabilities.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v.
Rockwell International Corp. et al., No. 95-3824 (ND IL).

     In its amended complaint filed Dec. 14, the EEOC seeks
injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages for the
12 rejected applicants who filed charges with the EEOC.

     According to published reports, the 12 who filed charges had
applied for work at Rockwell's auto parts plant in Centralia, IL,
but were denied employment when they failed nerve conduction
studies designed to reveal RSIs or a propensity to incur RSIs.
ADA regulations require that medical tests given to job
applicants be job-related and consistent with the needs of the
business.  The EEOC has questioned the validity of nerve
conduction studies as an indicator for RSIs.

     The complaint alleges that Rockwell violated Sections
102(a), 102(b)(1), and 102(b)(6) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. Sections
12112(a), 12112(b)(1), and 12112(b)(6), by "(a) failing to hire
the individuals listed...and other individuals because it
perceived them to have a disability within the meaning of the
ADA; (b) using employment tests that screen out a class of
individuals perceived to have disabilities; [and] (c) failing to
hire the individuals listed...and other individuals because they
had a record of a disability within the meaning of the ADA."

     The complaint asserts that Rockwell's engagement in
discriminatory employment practices was intentional and was done
with "malice or reckless indifference to the federally protected
rights of a class of individuals perceived to have disabilities."

     Also named in the complaint is Cambridge Industries, Inc. as
the successor to Rockwell at its Centralia facility.  Cambridge
purchased the facility from Rockwell in August 1994 and has
continued the operation since then.  According to the complaint,
Cambridge had notice of the charges at the time of the purchase.

     Representing the EEOC are Jean Powers Kamp, Gordon G.
Waldron and John C. Hendrickson of its Chicago office.
Representing Rockwell International are Richard H. Schnadig and
Nina G. Stillman of Vedder, Price, Kaufman & Kammholz in Chicago.

MANUFACTURERS GROUP REPORTS ON RSIs

     "Many misconceptions exist concerning the association
between upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders and office
work," the Office Ergonomics Research Committee (OERC) said in a
report released Jan. 4, entitled "Musculoskeletal Disorders in
the U.S. Office Workforce."

     "There is little scientific evidence on the exact causes of
[repetitive stress injuries] and the value of prescribed
interventions," the OERC says.  It adds that "[a] long term,
international research strategy is required to fill the voids in
our understanding."

     The OERC makes note of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data
that shows growth in the number of RSIs reported from 1990 to
1994.  The statistics show that the number of these injuries has
almost doubled in that period from 185,000 annually to 332,000.
However, the OERC notes that RSIs accounted for only 4.9% of all
occupational injuries in 1994, and that the rate of increase in
these injuries has lessened since 1993.

     The report goes on to examine the state of research into
input devices, such as computer keyboards; pointing devices, such
as computer mouses; workstation ergonomics; psychosocial
influences; medical considerations; and exercise.

     For example, the report cites a University of Rochester
study that found that keyboard users strike the keys four to five
times harder than necessary to activate the key.  The report
notes that the same study revealed that workers with symptoms of
RSIs strike the keys harder than do workers without symptoms.

     The report also cites a study by the National Institute on
Occupational Safety and Health that evaluated 127 exercises
recommended for keyboard users.  While the exercises were easily
performed in the office environment, 90% were seen as
questionable for workers with acute or chronic musculoskeletal
disorders, and 40% were judged to duplicate the "biomedical
demands" of keyboard use, says the OERC.

     The report concludes with descriptions of research projects
in the areas that the OERC has fully or partially funded.  One
such study by the University of California at San Francisco (UC-
SF) seeks to determine whether using a computer mouse causes
muscle fatigue and whether there is a difference in the fatigue
resulting from using a mouse with a drag lock compared to a
normal mouse.  The report says that an earlier UC-SF study showed
that mouses are being used 31% of the time in word processing
applications and 65% of the time in graphics applications.

     The OERC, a group composed of U.S. companies "concerned by
reports of an increasing number of [RSIs] among office workers,"
was formed in April 1991.  Its members include 3M, Apple
Computer, AT&T Global Information Solutions Corp., Compaq
Computer Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp.  The OERC lists as its
objectives: (1) the development of "an understanding of office
related [RSIs]"; (2) determining "the effect, if any, that office
work has on causing or exacerbating them"; (3) identifying the
interventions that "are successful in preventing or resolving
them"; and (4) ascertaining "whether appropriate medical
treatment is generally available to deal with them."

8TH CIR.: EVIDENTIARY ERROR WAS OF APPELLANT'S MAKING

     A panel of the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals Dec. 20
declined to overturn a district court ruling that found no bad
faith in an employer's initial refusal to pay workers'
compensation to a worker disabled by carpal tunnel syndrome.
Roth v. Homestake Mining Co. of California, No. 95-1073
(8th Cir.).

     The district court's alleged error in allowing the fact of
the employer's eventual agreement to settle the workers'
compensation claim was of the plaintiff's own making and was not
reversible, the panel said.

     According to the record before the panel, Monty L. Roth
became permanently and totally disabled in 1990 due to the
effects of carpal tunnel syndrome after 18 years of employment
with Homestake Mining Co.  When Homestake refused to pay his
workers' compensation claim, Roth filed a petition with the South
Dakota Department of Labor's Division of Labor and Management.
Some three years later, during an administrative hearing
conducted by that agency, Homestake agreed to settle Roth's claim
for $326,000.

     However, Roth had filed a bad-faith action in federal
district court prior to the settlement.  In this suit, Roth
sought actual and punitive damages.  A jury subsequently returned
the verdict that Homestake had not acted in bad faith.

               Roth appealed, arguing that the district court abused its
discretion in allowing the fact of the settlement into evidence
while not allowing him to show that one-third of the settlement
amount had been given to his attorney.

     The Eighth Circuit panel, in a decision written by Judge
Pasco M. Bowman, affirmed the judgment of the district court.

     The panel held that Roth's argument was "fatally flawed
because it proceeds from the premise that Homestake introduced
the evidence of the settlement amount."

     "The record reveals, however, that Roth, not Homestake,
introduced the exhibit that included the settlement amount...when
he included the exhibit in his pre-trial exhibit book," the panel
said.  Roth was aware that the district court had ruled to
exclude the payment to the attorney, but failed to withdraw the
exhibit in a timely manner, noted the panel.  The panel held that
there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the district
court where the complained-of error was invited by the party
seeking reversal of the judgment.

     Absent a showing of bad faith on the part of Homestake, the
panel declined to consider Roth's argument that the district
court erred when it refused to submit the issue of punitive
damages to the jury.  "Homestake cannot be liable for punitive
damages absent a finding of bad faith," the panel said.

     Representing Roth was Charles Lefholz in Rapid City, SD.
Representing Homestake were Bradley Paul Gordon and A. Peter
Fuller of Fuller & Tellinghuisen in Lead, SD.

MO CT. APP. FINDS INSURER AT TIME OF DISABILITY LIABLE FOR
BENEFITS

     The workers' compensation insurer at the time a repetitive
stress disability begins is liable for benefits, even if the
disease is diagnosed earlier while a different policy is in
effect, the Missouri Court of Appeals said in a unanimous Dec. 12
opinion.  Oberg v. American Recreational Products et al.,
No. 67026 (MO Ct. App.).

     The panel declined to impose liability on the predecessor
insurer whose policy was in effect at the time of diagnosis but
not of disability.

     Kathryn Oberg started work at American Recreational Products
in October 1987, sewing rope into tent hems.  In December 1988,
she was diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  The
next month, she underwent release surgery on her right hand only.
She resumed work after surgery.  She underwent release surgery on
her left hand on Oct. 3, 1989, three days after Liberty Mutual
Insurance replaced Home Insurance Co. as her employer's workers'
compensation carrier.

     After Oberg applied for disability benefits, an
administrative law judge found Liberty Mutual to be the insurer
at risk and awarded benefits for 17.5% permanent partial
disability.  The Labor and Industrial Relations Commission
modified by holding Home Insurance Co. liable rather than Liberty
Mutual.  Home was not a party to the claim.

     The Court of Appeals, Eastern District, reinstated Liberty
Mutual's liability in an opinion by Judge Kent E. Karohl.
Because Liberty Mutual's policy was in effect when Oberg's left
carpal tunnel syndrome became disabling, Liberty Mutual is
responsible for the award of benefits, the court said.  Although
the diagnosis predated that policy, there was no evidence of
disability until after the Liberty Mutual policy took effect, the
court said.  As a result, Oberg would have been unable to file a
claim until a disability existed.

     It also noted that Liberty Mutual was the insurer when Oberg
was last exposed to the risk, namely the day before surgery.

     Last, the court found the Commission's award against Home
improper because Home was never a party and did not participate
in the case.

     There was no dispute over the amount of the award or whether
Oberg's RSI was an occupational disease caused by the repetitive
activity of her job.

     Nile Griffiths of St. Louis represented Oberg.  Deborah L.
Hellmann of St. Louis appeared for Liberty Mutual.

PHYSICIAN'S INPUT TO DISABILITY RATING DEEMED INADMISSIBLE

     A panel of the New Mexico Court of Appeals has reversed and
remanded a workers' compensation judge's determination of the
disability rating of a worker with carpal tunnel syndrome.
Jurado v. Levi Strauss & Co., No. 15,396 (NM Ct. App.)

     The panel ruled that the testimony of a physician, on which
the rating was partially based, was inadmissible under New Mexico
law.

     Olga Jurado suffered an injury to her wrists and hands while
working at the "hem line" station of the Levi Strauss plant in
Roswell, NM, on Dec. 11, 1991.  She ceased working on March 5,
1992, and has not returned to work.  She had carpal tunnel
release surgeries in March and June 1992.  On May 14, 1993,
Jurado's orthopedist, a Dr. Allegretto, adjudged that she had
reached maximum medical improvement.  Allegretto assigned a 5%
impairment rating to each upper extremity, which translated to a
6% impairment for the "whole person."
               However, Jurado also complained of pain in her neck since
her injury.  After a number of doctors could find no explanation
for her symptoms, Jurado sought out the opinion of an independent
medical examiner, Dr. Guy R. Fogel.  Fogel examined Jurado and
established her permanent partial impairment rating to the body
as a whole at 5% for her neck and shoulder condition.

     A workers' compensation judge (WCJ), Peter L. Dinelli,
subsequently awarded Jurado a 14% permanent partial disability
rating by adding the ratings established by Drs. Allegretto and
Fogel to a 3% rating for Jurado's "specific vocational
preparation."

     Prior to determining Jurado's disability rating, the WCJ had
denied Levi Strauss's motion in limine to exclude Fogel's report.
Levi Strauss had argued that Fogel's report was inadmissible
testimony under NMSA Section 52-1-51(C) because Fogel was neither
Jurado's "authorized health care provider" nor an independent
medical examiner (IME) agreed to by the parties or selected by
the WCJ on petition by the parties.  The WCJ determined that
Fogel's report was not "testimony" within the meaning of Section
52-1-51(C) since it was "undertaken to determine impairment
ratings needed to calculate disability pursuant to the statutory
formula."

     Levi Strauss appealed, arguing that the WCJ erred in finding
Fogel's report admissible under Section 52-1-51(C).

     In its Nov. 1 opinion, the appellate panel agreed with Levi
Strauss and reversed the WCJ's denial of its motion in limine.
It noted that NMSA Section 52-1-51(C) limited physician testimony
at workers' compensation hearings to providers who had treated
the workers and to IMEs agreed to by the parties or selected by
the WCJ on petition by the parties.

     The panel said that it was clear, as did the WCJ, that Fogel
had not provided continuing medical care to Jurado.  The panel
also ruled that Fogel was not selected as an IME under the
statute since he was unilaterally chosen by Jurado.  The WCJ had
noted this fact as well.  However, the panel held that the WCJ
had misconstrued Workers' Compensation Act Rule 92.4.3E as
standing "for the proposition that the medical opinions of a
health care provider prepared in the form of a written report do
not constitute testimony under Section 52-1-52(C)."

     "The fact that it was 'undertaken to determine impairment
ratings needed to calculate disability pursuant to the statutory
formula' does not mean that it is admissible," said the panel.
It added that "[t]he Act does not authorize such an evaluation
except in connection with ongoing care from authorized treating
health care providers, ...or IMEs in situations where medical
issues are in dispute."

     Counsel for Jurado was James G. Chakeres in Albuquerque.
Counsel for Levi Strauss was Bryan D. Evans of Atwood, Malone,
Mann & Turner, P.A. in Roswell.

Baboon bone marrow recipient Jeff Getty leaves
hospital three weeks after historic transplant

Three weeks after undergoing an historic transfusion of baboon bone
marrow, AIDS patient Jeff Getty walked out of San Francisco General
Hospital with a smile and an admonition - "To the naysayers who
said that I would never recover from this procedure, well, here I
am.  And you were wrong."

While the long-term prognosis on the success or failure of the
experimental procedure remains anybody's guess, the 38-year-old
Getty left the hospital with no signs of diseases endemic to
baboons, telling wellwishers, "It feels like I just came from the
moon."  

"So far, the only thing we can really conclude is that the
procedure was safe, safer than we had initially expected. Jeff
tolerated everything very well," said Steven Deeks, MD, who
performed the procedure.  "The more critical question, about
whether or not this procedure actually provided any benefit for
Jeff, remains unclear.  Quite honestly, we just don't know."

Getty will be seen as an outpatient three times a week for the next
few weeks and if his recovery is deemed satisfactory, on a weekly
basis thereafter.  Blood drawn will be routinely sent to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Susan Ilstad,
MD, the University of Pittsburgh researcher who developed the
unique procedure and led the fight to get the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to approve the transplant. 

"We'll monitor him for six months at a minimum and hope to find the
baboon blood all through his blood stream looking for the virus,"
Dr. Ilstad said in a Jan. 17 interview on ABC's Prime Time Live. 
In response to a question about the chance of an outbreak of a
unknown baboon virus in humans, Dr. Ilstad answered curtly, "zero."

However, the media was rife with articles and interviews
questioning whether the transplant might lead to an "ebola-like"
virus outbreak.  

"This is a serious mistake," said Jonathan Allen, a primate
virologist, in an interview with Time magazine.  "It only takes one
transmission from one baboon to a human to start an epidemic.
There's no way you can make it safe." 

Allen, who works for the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical
Research in San Antonio, TX, the institution that supplied the
baboon for the experiment, also told the Washington Post that
"baboons are an infectious disease nightmare."

The FDA and CDC, the government agencies in charge of monitoring
public health safety, are both said to be close to finalizing draft
guidelines researchers and transplant teams will be urged to follow
"voluntarily." 

Late last year, CDC's Louisa Chapman, MD, and five colleagues
observed that a formal system of oversight must be established to
study the implications of xenografting on society .

"Clinicians and policy makers alike must recognize that although
xenotransplantation promises benefits for specific patients, that
promise is accompanied by an unquantifiable but undeniable
potential for harm to the wider community," wrote Dr. Chapman and
five colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine (33 (22):
1498-1501).  "Thus, in this new field the determination of what
constitutes an acceptable risk in the balance between caution and
progress is a matter of public concern, not merely a private matter
for individual scientists, physicians and patients to decide."

Alluding to Getty's (then) pending transplant, Dr. Chapman, et.al
added:  "If the risk of xenotransplant-associated infections is
restricted to the recipient, it simply constitutes one more factor
affecting the risks and benefits of transplantation.  However,
there may be wider implications for the human community."

Providing a preview of what the transplant community may expect to
see in the guidelines, the authors wrote: "Therefore, before
proceeding further with xenotransplantation, we need a
multidisciplinary consensus to facilitate the development of
measures designed to protect the safety of all, to indicate the
directions of further research, and to advance well-designed
clinical trials as the use of xenogeneic tissue makes the
transition from animal models to medical practice."

Phil Noguchi, MD, director of the FDA's division of cell and gene
therapy and one of the authors of the report, told Transplant News
the NEJM article was not aimed at reining in current research being
conducted by biotech companies.

"Some companies took hits after the article but they have all been
working closely with the FDA over the past year and half and the
concerns listed in the article are not aimed at them," Dr. Noguchi
said.

Dr. Noguchi said the FDA guidelines will concentrate on how the
xenografting process is carried out (could human's be infected with
an animal virus), quality control to protect the patient, and does
the process work (efficacy).

"The process doesn't need to be a pharmaceutical model as in the
past," Dr. Noguchi added.  "There is a challenge to come up with
a community based model.  We want to create a real revolution where
patient need is the center of the regulation, not the product
maker."

In the meantime, the transplant industry, AIDS community and
federal regulators will closely follow Getty's progress.

"If I let everyone have a sample of me who wants one, I'd be cut
up in a million pieces," Getty told Prime Time Live.

When asked his opinion of what had happened, Getty responded: "I
have an intuitive feeling we have engraftment.  However, I do know
this, we are going the learn something no matter what."

Conservative physician group seeks
investigation of Getty Transplant

The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, described as a
conservative think tank for 3,500 physicians, has asked the federal
Office for Protection from Research Risks, to investigate whether
the baboon bone marrow transplant to AIDS patient, Jeff Getty,
could endanger the public.

The group told the agency baboons carry numerous pathogens they
fear could infect people through such operations.

The Physicians Committee specifically asked the Risks office to
study whether the approval to go ahead with the operation by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was appropriate.  The Risks
office is part of the National Institutes of Health and has a
charge of guarding against dangerous medical research.

Responding to the charges, Mary Pendergast, FDA deputy
commissioner, noted, "The FDA's role was to build in more caution
to make (the experiment) safer than when it came to us," adding the
agency is sure the experimental operation can withstand the
scrutiny.

After death sentence overturned,
convicted confict causes controversy
by seeking liver transplant

A 400-pound convicted murderer who was spared the hangman's noose
because a federal judge ruled his weight might have resulted in his
decapitation has triggered yet another controversy in the state of
Washington because he needs a liver transplant.

The unusual case has generated considerable media attention both
on the judge's ruling and the need for a transplant. 

The state's Attorney General Christine Gregoire is seeking to have
the medical records of the inmate, Mitchell Rupe, opened so
taxpayers and the victims' families should know more about it,
United Press International reported.

"The public has a right to know Rupe's medical condition," Gregoire
said.  "Mitch Rupe already has made his medical condition a matter
of public record...He can't have it both ways."

Rupe, who was convicted of slaying two women bank tellers in
Olympia, WA, gained notoriety last year when a federal judge
overturned his death sentence, ruling he could not be hanged
because his weight might cause decapitation, and that would be
cruel and unusual punishment, UPI reported.

Under Washington law, a condemned inmate has the choice of hanging
or lethal injection and if he does not choose - as Rupe did 
not -he must be hanged.  It was that loophole that got the death
sentence overturned.  The state has appealed to the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeal.

Citing a provision of state law that says medical records are
confidential, corrections officials have refused to confirm a
report saying Rupe was undergoing evaluation for a liver
transplant.

The case has created an uproar in the media and the public, a
spokesperson for the Department of Corrections told Transplant
News.  "It has raised the blood pressure of the general public,"
she said.

"The issue is confidentiality of medical records and it is a
dilemma," said the spokesperson.  "We have read the law and it
contradictory on the matter so we have asked the courts to decide."

A ruling on the confidentiality is expected Jan. 26 or 27 the
spokesperson said.  "If they rule we can release the data, we will
do so ASAP," she added.

The furor also is fueling the threat of legislation being passed
in the Washington legislation to ban any incarcerated offender from
receiving a transplant.

"That would be a real problem," the spokesperson pointed out. 
"What if someone is on dialysis and a transplant could reduce the
costs of treatment significantly?  Or what if it is a mother with
a couple of children who is a first time offender?  If legislation
is passed it could cast a wide blanket over all."

The Northwest Organ Procurement Agency has received only a few
calls and only one torn up donor card, Karyn Denton, the OPO
director told Transplant News.

"We were asked to refer all calls to the Department of Corrections
and that's what we have done," Denton said.

Is the public outraged?  "We have just received a stack of mail
from the governor's office," the corrections spokesperson said. 
"Many are sending in torn up donor cards.  People are so angry. 
We're telling people it is a personal decision but we hope they
won't hurt someone else by not donating just because of this case."

Rupe is not on the waiting list for a liver at this time. 
However the courts decide, a thorny question will remain to be
answered: given the current donor shortage, should an expensive,
life-saving liver transplant be considered to keep Rupe alive when
he may eventually be executed?

Japanese effort to pass donation legislation 
tabled again; 1995 controversies may have hurt cause

While the Japanese Diet is still struggling to come to adopt
legislation that will allow organ transplants from patients
declared brain dead, two scandals in recent months have possibly
added to the difficulties of gaining passage any time soon.

On Dec. 14 the Committee on Health Welfare of the Lower House
decided that the Organ Transplant Bill, first presented in April
1994, should be deliberated on a continual basis in future
committee meetings.  The action marked the sixth time the bill has
been shelved, according to Comline Japan Daily.

Two weeks later, the Japanese official in charge of overseeing
Japan's kidney transplant network admitted a faulty computer system
had prevented three patients from receiving transplants after 1,006
names were deleted from the waiting list and 395 were erroneously
listed as deceased.

Teruo Omae, executive director of the network, explained the old
computer system at the national hospital in Sakura, Chiba
Prefecture, was defective and there had been problems with the
transfer of new information to a new system initiated last April,
the Kyodo News Service reported.

There are approximately 18,000 patients registered as waiting for
a kidney in Japan.  Omae said the 1,006 lost names resulted in the
patients not receiving laboratory tests when a potential donor was
found and three were apparently passed over who would have been
given priority for the organs.

The Health and Welfare Ministry has ordered an investigation into
the irregularities.

The computer mishap caused a minor stir compared to a major
controversy that occurred in June which led to one of Japan's most
renowned transplant surgeons, Professor Kazuo Ota, to apologize
for performing at least 13 transplants using kidneys that had
previously been rejected by the United Network for Organ Sharing
(UNOS).

In an article in the Lancet (Vol. 346: 41-2) and reprinted in the
November issue of the ETCO Newsletter (European Transplant
Coordinators Organization), Catrien Ross reported "at least four
of the operations done by Ota were unauthorized because they took
place" after the National Kidney Transplant Network had been
launched last April.  

Ross reported the UNOS-like network, had "specifically asked that
kidneys rejected in the U.S. not be used by Japanese surgeons. 
Some transplantations were allegedly done as much as 72 hours after
the organs had been removed from the donors."

Professor Ota defended his actions by saying he had been unable to
contact the network and that "he had to do the operations to ensure
that the U.S. continued to provide kidneys." UNOS has not provided
organs to Japan since early June, Ross said.

Ota, a professor at Tokyo Women's Medical College, apologized for
"causing trouble," and resigned as head of Japan's Hemodialysis
Society.

Newspaper poll reveals 70% of Japanese
support organ transplants from brain dead donor

More than 70% of Japanese polled in December said they supported
organ transplants if the donor is declared brain dead and 46% were
willing to accept brain death as the death of a person, according
to a report in the Lancet written by Catrien Ross.

The nationwide poll of 3,000 eligible Japanese voters was conducted
in December by the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun.

The poll also revealed about 61% supported passage of a law
permitting transplants from patients declared brain dead, 20%
opposed them, and 51% approved if the individual had given prior
written consent.

Ross also reported Soka Gakkai, Japan's largest lay Buddhist
organization, announced it will recognize brain death as the
termination of life "once the medical community has reached such
a consensus." Soka Gakkai has a membership of 8.3 million families
- there are 124 million people in Japan.

A report compiled by Soka Gakkai physician members said
transplantation is "not in conflict with the organization's
Buddhist teachings," and recommends "a donor registration and donor
card-carrying system, creation of a transplant information network,
training medical coordinators to arrange transplantations, and a
law to prohibit the sale of organs."

The organization also favors the donation of organs from brain dead
people only if the person has previously indicated their wish to
donate.  This differs from the legislation being proposed in the
Diet which would permit donation if the family of the deceased
gives consent.

Transplant coordinators society formed
to increase international communication

A new international society for transplant coordinators has been
formed to increase communication and collaboration between
individual transplant coordinators and international associations
and societies.

The society, dubbed the International Transplant Coordinators
Society (ITCS), has elected a board and plans to hold meetings and
seminars to provide professional education for its members.

Leo Roels, scientific program director of the ITCS, told Transplant
News the aims of the society include:

"*fostering communication and collaboration amongst transplant
coordinators individually as well as with national and
international associations or societies interested in the field of
transplantation, transplant coordination and related subjects;

*providing its membership and the general public information on an
international level concerning organ/tissue donation and the
benefits of organ and tissue transplantation;

*providing professional education to its membership with a goal of
enhancing the profession of transplant coordinator.  The education
may take the form of a biennial meeting with the presentation of
abstracts, formation of specific educational meetings, or
endorsement of existing educational programs of transplant
coordinator societies and/or organizations;

*promoting research and providing a forum for the presentation of
research findings on organ and tissue donation, procurement and
transplantation."

Roels says the ITCS hopes to organize an international meeting in
conjunction with the 4th International Meetings of the Society for
Organ Sharing (SOS), 4th International Samuel L. Kountz Symposium
and 2nd International Non-Heart-Beating Donor Workshop, to be held
July 9-13, 1997 in Washington, DC.

The "founding board" of the ITCS includes: President - Seigo
Hiraga, MD, Tokai University School of Medicine, Bohsaidai,
Isahara, Kanagawa, Japan; Vice President - Greg Armstrong, RN,
Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia; Secretary - Sally
Kong, LSW, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore; 
Treasurer - Teresa Shafer, LifeGift Organ Donation Center, Fort
Worth, TX; Scientific Program Director - Leo Roels, CPTC,
University Hospital, Leuven, Belgium.

New Jersey law requires hospitals to
report all deaths to state's OPO

A new law which contains a provision requiring hospitals to report
every death when it occurs to the state's organ procurement
organization (OPO) has been passed and signed into law in New
Jersey. 

The new law is similar, but not as far-reaching, as legislation
passed in Pennsylvania last year.

The Donor Enhancement Act streamlines the state's donation process
with the hope of easing the state's donor shortage, according to
the New Jersey Organ and Tissue Sharing Network.

Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed the act into law on Nov. 6.  The
act was sponsored by Sen. Jack Sinagra (R-Middlesex) and
Assemblyman Alex DeCroce (R-Morris).

Hospitals are now required to report every death when it occurs to
The Sharing Network so it can determine donor suitability.  To
simplify the donation process, the law also eliminates the need for
hospitals to complete an Organ Donation Option Certificate.

Other provisions of the law include:

*training for transplant coordinators on how to seek consent;

*allows certified surgical specialists to perform the procurement
of tissues;

*mandates medical record audits of all hospital deaths (practice
had been voluntary).

Pennsylvania implements law which appropriates
$300,000 to donor awareness trust fund

Pennsylvania has implemented a new law which appropriated $300,000
to the Organ Donation Awareness Trust Fund to administer the Organ
Donor Card Program.  Gov. Tom Ridge signed the bill releasing the
appropriation on Dec. 20.

Senate Bill 1303, sponsored by Sen. Melissa Hart (R-Allegheny),
reimburses the Department of Transportation for the administrative
costs of implementing the Organ Donor Law (Act 102 of 1994).  

The law also created an Organ Donor Advisory Committee to advise
the Health Department of ways to encourage organ donation. (TN,
11/30/95)

Gov. Ridge is encouraging Pennsylvania residents to send in
contributions to the Organ Donor Awareness Trust Fund, Department
of Health, P.O. Box 90, Harrisburg, PA 17108-0090.

Wisconsin swine center fire kills 700 pigs;
many had been used in transpalnt research

A fire at the swine center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's
Agricultural Research Station in Arlington killed 700 pigs,
including some that were being used in organ transplant research.
The fire, which occurred on Dec. 20, also 80 killed pigs that had
been used in a 20-year research project on cholesterol.

The blaze reduced the building that housed hogs, laboratories, a
surgery room, gestation, maternity and nursery wards into a
smoldering pile of ashes, the Knight-Ridder Business News reported. 
Officials said the cost of replacing the structure would be more
than $350 million.

The fire destroyed decades of agricultural, biomedical and
environmental research as well as animals that resulted from 30
years of genetic selection.

"I think the toughest loss is the number of years some of the
scientists had invested in their research here," said David Jensen,
research program manager for the Swine Research and Teaching
Center.  "These animals were indispensable to their work."

AMA "temporarily suspends" policy regarding
procurement of organs from anencephalics

Responding to criticism from its own membership, the American
Medical Association (AMA) has "temporarily suspended" its policy
of regarding it ethically acceptable to procure organs from
anencephalic babies.

The change, which is expected to remain for the next several years,
will result in reinstatement of the AMA's previous policy which
favors prohibiting the use of anencephalic babies as organ donors
until they meet the legal criterion for brain death - the complete
cessation of brain function.

In June 1994, the AMA Council on Judicial and Ethical Affairs
issued its opinion that anencephalic babies could be organ donors
as long as the request to donate came from the child's parents and
not the medical establishment caring for the baby.  

The original opinion read in part:  "It is ethically permissible
to consider the anencephalic as a potential organ donor, although
still alive under the current definition of death only if: (1) the
diagnosis of anencephaly is certain and is confirmed by two
physicians who are not part of the organ transplant team; (2) the
parents of the infant desire to have the infant serve as an organ
donor and indicate such in writing; and (3) there is compliance
with the Council's Guidelines for the Transplantation of Organs."

Charles Plows, MD, council chairman, said the change reflected
concern about the organ donors, especially children's organs, and
the case of parents who wanted to donate the organs of their
anencephalic newborn but were not allowed to by a Florida court,
the New York Times reported.

"They were, if you want to call it that, actually deprived of
salvaging something from this tragic experience," Dr. Plows said,
"and we were left with nothing as far as feeling that they could
contribute something in the way of transplants."

While the 1994 opinion never led to any anencephalic donations
before brain death, the council's opinion drew heavy criticism
because it broke the "dead donor rule."  

The American Academy of Neurology had requested that the AMA change
its position.

"Whatever little benefit might occur from the organs would be more
than outweighed by the damage to society," said James Bernat, MD,
a neurologist at the Dartmouth Medical Center and chair of the
academy's Ethics Committee.  "Once you start killing people for
their organs, people would begin to push the envelope.  We felt it
was better to maintain the dead donor rule even if there would be
fewer organs around."

The AMA says the change will give researchers time to do more
research on the brain function of anencephalic babies.  Of
particular interest is whether the babies have the potential to
experience any degree of consciousness.

Immunex receives FDA clearance to market Leukine as 
growth factor for peripheral blood progenitor cells 

Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA, announced it has received marketing
clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
Leukine(R) (sargramostim), as the first growth factor indicated for
use in mobilizing peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) and for
use after PBPC transplantation.

The company reports in a study of 196 patients, Leukine given to
mobilize PBPCs significantly increased the number of progenitor
cells collected.  When Leukine was given after transplantation with
mobilized PBPSs, there was further acceleration in white blood cell
recovery.  In addition, the number of platelet transfusions and
red blood cell transfusions needed was decreased and patients were
discharged from the hospital earlier when compared to patients not
receiving Leukine. 

Leukine was originally licensed by the FDA in March, 1991 for use
following autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and was
licensed in Dec. 1991 to prevent death following BMT engraftment
delay or failure. In Sept. 1995 Leukine was licensed to prevent
early death from infection following induction chemotherapy for
older patients suffering from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) 
In Nov. 195, Immunex also received FDA marketing clearance for
Leukine's use in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. (TN,
11/30/95)

CellPro says FDA advisory committee will review
its PMA for CEPRATE in late February 

CellPro, Inc., Seattle, WA, has received notification from the FDA
that the company's pre-market approval application (PMA) for the
CEPRATE(R) SC Stem Cell Concentration System will be reviewed by
the FDAs Biological Response Modifiers Advisory Committee in late
February.  The CEPRATE SC System completed a Phase III clinical
trial in autologous bone marrow transplantation in May 1993, and
CellPro filed a PMA with the FDA in December of that year.  In Dec.
1994, the FDA requested additional information from the company,
which was provided in Aug. and Sept. 1995.

The CEPRATE SC System is CellPro's first product to complete
clinical testing in the U.S.  The CEPRATE SC System is a medical
device that separates human stem cells from the other cells of the
bone marrow of peripheral blood.

CellPro began sales of the CEPRATE SC System in Europe during 1993. 
The product received the CE mark for marketing approval from the
18-nation European Economic Union in July 1995 and ISO 9002 quality
certification in Sept. 1995.  In addition to countries in Europe,
the company has marketing approval for the CEPRATE SC System in
Canada.

The system is currently being used in clinical trials for various
applications at over 175 institutions in the U.S. and Europe.  The
company's CEPRATE LC Laboratory Cell Separation System line of
products for nonclinical research is available worldwide.

SEOUL HOPES CEAUSESCU'S FALL MAY ENCOURAGE N. KOREA REFORM+

     SEOUL, DEC. 26 KYODO - THE DRAMATIC DOWNFALL OF ROMANIA'S
PRESIDENT NICOLAE CEAUSESCU WILL BRING HEAVY PRESSURE TO NORTH KOREA
TO REORIENT ITS CLOSED SOCIETY TOWARD OPENNESS AND REFORMS, ANALYSTS
HERE SAID TUESDAY.
     IT MUST HAVE COME AS A BIGGER SURPRISE THAN ANY DEVELOPMENT IN
OTHER EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SINCE PYONGYANG HAS MAINTAINED CLOSE
TIES WITH ROMANIA.
     NORTH KOREAN LEADERS ARE, HOWEVER, CONCENTRATING THEIR EFFORTS
ON MORE INTENSIVE INDOCTRINATION OF THE PEOPLE RATHER THAN COMPLYING
WITH A WAVE OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGE AND ECONOMIC REFORMS SWEEPING THE
EAST BLOC, ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVERS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE SOUTH
KOREAN GOVERNMENT.
     "THE NORTH NOW SEEMS TO FEEL A SENSE OF ISOLATION FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WITH THE FALL OF THE STALINIST ROMANIAN
LEADER WITH WHOM NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM IL SUNG HAD SO FAR FELT
AFFINITY," SAID CHOI MOON HYUN, DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR POLICY AT THE
NATIONAL UNIFICATION BOARD.
     NORTH KOREA SENT A CONGRATULATORY MESSAGE TO CEAUSESCU ON THE
OCCASION OF THE 14TH ROMANIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESS LAST MONTH IN
WHICH IT STRESSED A JOINT STRUGGLE AGAINST CAPITALISM.  EARLY THIS
MONTH, FOREIGN MINISTER KIM YONG NAM VISITED BUCHAREST TO REAFFIRM
SOLIDARITY IN THE FACE OF DRASTIC CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE, CHOI
NOTED.
     "PYONGYANG WILL FIND NO OPTION BUT TO TAKE A POSITIVE POSTURE
IN GLASNOST AND PERESTROIKA IN THE LONG RUN.  THERE ARE SIGNS THAT IT
WOULD EMERGE FROM THE LONG-HELD ISOLATION POLICY DURING THE FIRST
HALF OF NEXT YEAR, IT MAY BE SENSED IN DIALOGUE WITH THE SOUTH,"
HE SAID.
     CHOI BYUNG BO, SPOKESMAN FOR THE BOARD, SOUTH KOREA'S TOP
UNIFICATION AUTHORITY, SAID THE NORTH MIGHT EXPERIMENT WITH OPENNESS
IN ITS SLUGGISH ECONOMY AMONG OTHER FIELDS, LIKE CHINA.
     "WE HEAR THAT THE PACE OF OPENNESS WAS ON THE AGENDA FOR THE
MEETING KIM IL SUNG HAD WITH DENG XIAOPING DURING HIS SUDDEN VISIT TO
BEIJING EARLY LAST MONTH," THE SPOKESMAN SAID.
     THE ANALYSTS GENERALLY RULED OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A SURGE FROM
BELOW, SAYING THOUGH THE LEADERSHIP IS EXPECTED TO ADOPT GRADUAL
REFORMS FROM ABOVE.
     SHIN YOUNG SUK, DIRECTOR OF THE PRIVATE, PEACE RESEARCH
INSTITUTE, ATTRIBUTED THE COLLAPSE OF CEAUSESCU TO THE ROMANIAN
PEOPLE, AWAKENED BY A SERIES OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGES AND THE EAST-WEST
THAW IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES AND A LOT OF "PRO-SOVIET"
GENERALS IN THE ARMED FORCES WHO SUPPORT REFORMS.
     "THE CASE IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF NORTH KOREA.
PYONGYANG'S DEPENDENCY ON MOSCOW IS NOTABLY LOW IN ITS ADROIT
EQUI-DISTANCE DIPLOMACY.  THE MILITARY IS LOYAL TO KIM IL SUNG, AND
THE PEOPLE ARE NOT WELL AWARE OF CURRENT EAST EUROPEAN EVENTS DUE TO
TIGHT CONTROL OF INFORMATION," HE SAID.
     THE NORTH KOREAN MEDIA ON SUNDAY BRIEFLY REPORTED ON UPRISINGS
IN "A FEW" ROMANIAN CITIES WITHOUT MENTIONING ABOUT
CEAUSESCU'S ARREST.
     THE RODONG SHINMUN, THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF NORTH KOREA'S
WORKERS' PARTY, CARRIED A LENGTHY EDITORIAL IN ITS FRONT AND SECOND
PAGES FRIDAY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO "DRIVE AWAY IMPERIALIST
CHALLENGES AND MARCH ON THE PATH OF SOCIALISM WITH MORE VIGOR,"
THE VERY DAY THE ROMANIAN SITUATION CAPTURED HEADLINES IN MOST PAPERS
AROUND THE WORLD.

INDONESIAN PAPER COMPARES CEAUSESCU TO DRACULA+

     JAKARTA, DEC. 27 KYODO - AN INDONESIAN DAILY NEWSPAPER COMMENTED
ON THE EXECUTION OF ROMANIAN PRESIDENT NICOLAE CEAUSESCU ON
WEDNESDAY, COMPARING HIM TO DRACULA AND SAYING NOBODY WHO IS SANE
WILL MOURN HIS DEATH.

HARD TO EXPECT A ROMANIAN CITIZEN, OR ANYBODY SANE FOR THAT MATTER,
TO MOURN THE DEATH BY A FIRING SQUAD OF ROMANIAN LEADER, DICTATOR
NICOLAE CEAUSESCU AND HIS WIFE, ELENA."
     IT ADDED, "SOME PEOPLE, WHILE SAYING 'GOOD RIDDANCE,' MIGHT
HAVE WISHED THE EXECUTION TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE YEARS BEFORE CEAUSESCU
AND HIS SECRET POLICE HAD THE CHANCE TO COMMIT SUCH GENOCIDE AGAINST
ROMANIAN PEOPLE EVEN COUNT DRACULA WOULD HAVE BEEN REAL SICK OF."
     COUNT DRACULA WAS A FICTIONAL VAMPIRE WHO LIVED IN
TRANNSYLVANIA, A REGION IN WESTERN ROMANIA.
     THE EDITORIAL SAID CEAUSESCU HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS
"SATANIC," AND AT ONE POINT IN HISTORY HE EVEN DELIGHTED THE
WEST WITH HIS INDEPENDENT VIEWS AS FAR AS MOSCOW-LED COMMUNISM WAS
CONCERNED.
     "CEAUSESCU WAS AFTER ALL ANOTHER DICTATOR WHO HAS FOUND HIS
DEMISE IN A WAY THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME A SOMBER PROMISE FOR RULERS
REFUSING TO CLIMB OFF THE TIGER THEY ARE RIDING WHILE THE DISMOUNTING
IS STILL SAFE," THE EDITORIAL CONCLUDED.
     INDONESIAN NEWSPAPERS HEADLINED THE EXECUTION OF CEAUSESCU AND
HIS WIFE IN THEIR WEDNESDAY EDITIONS.

IN THE WAKE OF THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL, EAST-WEST DETENTE AND
OTHER RAPID CHANGES IN EASTERN EUROPE, THE SOURCES SAID.

     JAPANESE GOVERNMENT SOURCES SAY IT IS UNTHINKABLE THAT DEMANDS
FOR REFORMS WOULD COME FROM CITIZENS IN NORTH KOREA AS THEY DID IN
EASTERN EUROPE.

     HONG KONG, DEC. 29 KYODO - BEIJING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HECLED A
STATE COUNCIL SPOKESMAN WHEN HE TOLD THEM CHINA WILL ALWAYS "WALK
THE PATH OF SOCIALISM," ACCORDING TO VARIOUS HONG KONG PRESS
REPORTS FRIDAY.
     STATE COUNCIL SPOKESMAN YUAN MU -- A CLOSE AIDE OF CHINESE
PREMIER LI PENG -- DREW HISSES FROM A HAND-PICKED AUDIENCE OF 300
STUDENTS DURING A SUPRISE VISIT TO THE UNIVERSITY ON THURSDAY,
REPORTS SAID.
     IN A TWO-HOUR "DIALOGUE," YUAN ANSWERED QUESTIONS WHICH
HAD BEEN SUBMITTED IN ADVANCE AND POSED BY APPROVED STUDENT LEADERS
REGARDING CHINA'S RESPONSE TO EVENTS IN ROMANIA.
     BUT YUAN REFUSED TO ANSWER WHEN A STUDENT SHOUTED A QUESTION
ABOUT WHY OUSTED COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF ZHAO ZIYANG HAD BEEN BLAMED
FOR ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY SENIOR LEADER DENG
XIAOPING'S POLICIES.
     HE ALSO IGNORED A QUESTION ON WHY DENG HAD SUDDENLY APPOINTED
JIANG ZEMIN AS SUCCESSOR TO ZHAO ZIYANG AFTER ALLOWING THE FALL OF
EXPERIENCED REVOLUTIONARIES LIKE ZHAO AND HU YAOBANG.
     HU YAOBANG WAS DISMISSED IN 1987 FOR FAILING TO QUELL STUDENT
DISSENT AND HIS DEATH IN APRIL THIS YEAR SPARKED THE PRO-DEMOCRACY
MOVEMENT WHICH WAS CRUSHED IN THE TIANANMEN MILITARY CRACKDOWN IN
JUNE.

IN PUBLIC SINCE VISITING STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS IN MAY - IS STILL

BY SAYING, "NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION IS IN THE REST OF THE
WORLD, CHINA WILL ALWAYS WALK THE PATH OF SOCIALISM."
     YUAN'S UNANNOUNCED VISIT TO THE UNIVERSITY SHOWS THE ANXIETY
FELT BY THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP ABOUT THE POSSIBLE
REPERCUSSIONS OF THE FALL OF THE HARD-LINE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT IN
ROMANIA, ANALYSTS SAID.
     THE DEFIANCE SHOWN BY A HAND-PICKED STUDENT AUDIENCE INDICATES
THE CURRENT LEVEL OF DISTRUST THAT EXISTS BETWEEN STUDENTS AND THE
PARTY, THEY ADDED.
     MEANWHILE, IN FURTHER SIGNS OF DISSENT, LARGE-CHARACTER POSTERS
HAVE APPEARED AT BEIJING AND QINGHUA UNIVERSITIES COMMENTING ON THE
ROMANIAN UPRISING, ACCORDING TO A REPORT IN FRIDAY'S HONG KONG

     Friday's market plunge after credit card capping reveals the

     Friday's market plunge after credit card capping reveals the
extent of Administration dismay on economic policy and shows a
split between the President's advisers.
     Pat Buchanan's sudden appearance as a challenger signals real
problems for Bush presidential campaign, which is a long way from
getting started. He also may face David Duke and possibly others.
     Is this the week for Mario Cuomo? Nobody knows for sure. It is
unthinkable that he won't announce after all the backing and
filling, but it is still not a done deal.
     Despite being badly beaten, David Duke still poses serious
problems for the Republican Party and George Bush.
     Senate outlook for Republicans is so grim that Majority Leader
Robert Dole is dead serious in possibly bowing out rather than
seeking re-election.

BUSH ADMINISTRATION
     Economic Policy: Amid all the confusion, it is now clear that
Bush will not press for a tax cut package until the State of the
Union address. In so doing, the President has put himself in the
middle of three groups inside his Administration on strategy about
how to handle the recession.
     Group #1: This is largely Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
all by himself. He is into optimism on the economy, contending that
recovery is at hand and arguing against "talking down" the economy.
His comments on Meet the Press Sunday were viewed as "not helpful"
by one key Republican insider but nobody wants to take on the
President's close associate.
     Group #2: The economy is in bad shape and it's absolutely
essential that something be done now. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp is
the only cabinet member who publicly takes this position, but he
has substantial support from conservatives in Congress led by Rep.
Vin Weber (R-Minn.).
     Group #3: The economy is poor, but this is not the time to
move. Since it will be very difficult to make any progress in the
Democratic Congress at any rate, why not wait until next year? This
is the view of a majority inside the Administration (including
Budget Director Richard Darman) and much of the Congressional
Republican leadership.
     Bush has moved quietly from Group #1 to Group #3. On his
political travels he has heard the sad story of economic woe from
"Team 100" members (GOP heavy financial contributors) who tell him
they simply no longer have the resources to put out the
contributions that they used to. He wants action, but doesn't
really know what to do and isn't ready to do it now.
     Against this backdrop is deep irritation, particularly from
Chief-of-Staff John Sununu, that Kemp went public in declaring his
wishes for an immediate tax cut. Kemp has no intention of quitting,
and the President has no intention of firing him. But the tension
is such that it is hard to imagine how the current state of affairs
can continue indefinitely.
     Kemp is privately urging Bush to call for a special session of
Congress to deal with the economy, but his status is shown by the
fact that the President signed the bill gouging Kemp's efforts to
privatize public housing.
     Credit Card Cap: The President's support of a "voluntary"
credit card cap and subsequent Senate passage of a "mandatory" cap
reflect the lack of economic strategy both in the White House and
on Capitol Hill.
     1) The idea originated at a secret political planning meeting
Nov. 6 by formal and informal Bush advisers. Ex-White House Chief-
of-Staff Ken Duberstein urged that the President start "demagoging"
on credit card interest rates. The reaction around the dinner was
mixed.
     2) Duberstein's idea crept into the White House bloodstream
and got some support from Sununu. Although it was not officially
part of the text, the President included it in a New York
speech.
     3) Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R.-N.Y.), facing a tough re-election,
took off with the idea and ran; and a Senate wanting to do
something passed the proposal. Speaker Thomas Foley (D.-Wash.)
responded that he would hurry the bill through the House pronto.
Bush's economic gurus were apoplectic, and CEA Chief Michael Boskin
railed against it at the senior staff meeting two days later.
     4) That set up two distinct schools of thought in the Bush
camp. The policy people--Brady, Darman, Boskin, Kemp--are appalled
by the whole idea. The politicians--Republican National Chairman
Clayton Yuetter, Charlie Black, Craig Fuller and Duberstein--think
it's a terrific idea.
     5) Last Saturday after the credit card cap appeared to have
played its part in the Friday market drop, Kemp--appearing on the
Evans & Novak program on CNN--declared Bush would veto the D'Amato
bill. It is extremely doubtful that Kemp had a real authorization
from the President to go this far, but he is a fearless soul not
averse to taking chances. The next day, Brady and VP Dan Quayle
took the same stance, though a little bit more chary about
predicting a veto.
     6) That leaves Bush in the position of making sure that a bill
will not pass that embodies the position he wanted the banks to
take voluntarily. It is a straddle that would make any politician
look uncomfortable.
     7) It is clear now that the credit card cap will not become
law, but the mischief of a policy vacuum becomes obvious. With the
economy down, deadlock between the branches of government and the
budget deal impeding action, frustration both downtown and on the
Hill can cause severe trouble.
     RTC Financing: The coming battleground, perhaps this week, is
the attempt by Weber and other House conservatives not to let the
RTC financing bill pass without aa economic growth package
attached. Weber is insisting on a capital gains rate reduction and
an elimination of the "passive loss" provision from  the '86 reform
act.
     Kemp, as befits his character, has jumped in to support the
Weber proposal. Establishment Republican Senators, intimidated by
Democratic power, think messing around with the bailout is sheer
madness. This is the kind of proposal that the Bush Administration
would veer away from quickly, but oddly it has said nothing about
it one way or another as we go to press.
     The question is whether the House GOPers can even bring this
onto the floor under the right rules there, which is why they would
like some collaborators in the Senate to take advantage of the
easier rules there. Conservative House members are looking at House
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) to see which way he will go on
this one; some colleagues see him trying to straddle the Bush White
House and the House bomb-throwers.
     U.S-China: If Secretary of State James Baker has actually
succeeded in reducing China's arm sales proclivity, not many in
Washington believe it. But there is no doubt that Beijing's
hardliners are not as powerful as they were in the aftermath of
Tiananmen Square. Outside Beijing, the Chinese are paying very
little attention to their government and the free-market
experiments continue in the South.
     This is the China that White House advocates of continued MFN
status point to whenever the topic is broached. Denying those
potential markets to U.S. business, they say, will guarantee that
the Japanese and other Asian players will dominate the Pacific for
years to come. Both the Japanese and Taiwanese believe they can use
the coming integration of Hong Kong into China as a springboard for
ventures in South China.
     All of this will come to the fore when Congress reacts to
Baker's failure to get human rights pledges from the Chinese. With
only limited success on other fronts, the Administration will
likely fall back on economic arguments to keep the MFN window to
China open. Beijing's conditional pledge not to sell missiles to
Syria or Pakistan won't carry much weight with Congressmen who
think such sales shouldn't even be contemplated and does nothing to
address nuclear assistance to Iran. But the White House is helped
by the Democrats' insistence on focusing on domestic events.

PRESIDENTIAL '92

     Buchanan: His sudden appearance at the door, presumably to
run, makes life difficult for the White House. What does he have in
mind?
     1) Almost certainly, he will run. He cannot again pull up to
the line as he did in '87 and then pull away. His announcement is
expected at the end of next week.
     2) He is not merely interested in pulling Bush back to the
Reaganite conservative positions that Buchanan thinks the President
has abandoned (notably the tax issue and quotas) but to stake out
the nationalistic "America First" agenda he has been airing out
over television and in his column: protectionist on trade,
exclusionist on immigration, isolationist on foreign intervention.
     3) A realist, Buchanan knows he cannot be nominated. But an
impressive performance would put him on the top of the '96 list,
where he would now be an also-ran. His underlying premise must be:
can '92 do for Buchanan in '96 what '76 did for Reagan in '80?
     4) That means Buchanan is not interested in a quick pop in New
Hampshire but wants to stay in as long as possible, picking up lots
of delegates to take to Houston.
     All this hinges on how Buchanan does in N.H.:
     1) Apart from the Manchester Union Leader and possibly ex-Rep.
Chuck Douglas (R), Buchanan does not have much in the way of
conventional endorsements. Even State Sen. (and ex-U.S. Sen.)
Gordon Humphrey (R) is not helping.
     2) Sununu, who guided Bush to victory there in '88, is less
influential as Chief-of-Staff and has not enhanced his popularity
with repeated political interventions from the White House the past
three years.
     3) Buchanan's right-wing populism--and anti-foreign aid
strictures--should play well in New Hampshire's deep recession.
     4) His opposition to Desert Storm is a negative, but less so
today than it would have been nine months ago.
     5) The question of how Bush reacts to Buchanan is a difficult
one, and has not even been addressed at the White House.
     Duke: There has never been any doubt that once Duke lost his
race for Governor of Louisiana, he would enter the presidential
primaries. It looks as though he will stay out of N.H. to see how
Buchanan does there but enter all the southern primaries.
     Other Republican Candidates: Critics of Bush who don't care
for Buchanan would like a supply-side, pro-Israel, free trade, free
immigration, internationalist alternative. Kemp and former
Education Secretary William J. Bennett both fill the bill, but
neither has the slightest intention of running against Bush.
     Bush: He is his own campaign manager and all reports show that
he is not happy about the way things are going. The delay in naming
the proposed triumvirate of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher,
political consultant Robert Teeter and businessman Fred Malek leads
to musing that he is not happy with that set-up.
     Reports from the inside suggest that Sununu may be brought
over from the White House to run the campaign with either Brady or
Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner taking over at the White
House. But the odds are against it. Another version has a more
important role for Charlie Black.
     Cuomo: Almost everybody thinks this is the week he will
announce his candidacy, but nobody is sure. They are swimming
upstream but two astute Mario-watchers think he will say
no--figuring in the end his unsureness will lead him not to run.
     No other figure in American political life would go through
the process that Cuomo has for the last month and then destroy
himself by saying no, but with the Governor that is barely
possible.
     If on the other hand, he does what is rational and announces
his candidacy shortly before or after Thanksgiving, here is the
outlook:
     1) By design or not, Cuomo's delay has radically shortened the
game--to his advantage and to the disadvantage of lesser known
candidates. In a short campaign for the New Hampshire primary, he
has a huge edge in name i.d., money and campaigning experience. If
he wins comfortably in New Hampshire, he could be off and running
for the nomination.
     2) How much Cuomo has hurt himself with this minuet is hard to
say. The reporters don't like it and neither do many politicians,
but it shouldn't make much difference to politicians.
     3) The conventional wisdom of six months ago, that Cuomo was
the only Democrat who could have a chance to overtake an invincible
Bush, has turned into the current conventional wisdom that he is
the one of the least effective challengers of a wounded Bush.
     4) Cuomo's greatest liability is the fiscal crisis of New
York. Whereas Dukakis in '88 campaigned with the benefit of the
Massachusetts Miracle, Cuomo this time would have to campaign with
the burden of the New York Nightmare. Cuomo was a bit rough two
weeks ago in answering questions from his own constituents over the
televised ombudsman's program. Think what it will be like with the
media.
     Clinton: Mario-mania has eclipsed Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton,
but so far he looks like the pick of the Demo litter. He has his
act in order and impresses everywhere. He is a long way from being
a regional candidate and is on the verge of locking up some big New
York money.
     Kerrey: Those who expected Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) to be the
salvation of the Democratic party are a little disappointed. One
party insider told us he personally looks a little "weak"--a
strange description for a war hero. He did attract some attention
for audacity this week, however, by going after some anti-Mario
public employees' unions in New York.

POLITICS '91

     Louisiana Governor: Edwin Edwards (D) prevented what was
widely regarded across the political spectrum as a political
catastrophe in the election of David Duke. But neither party can
take much satisfaction in the results--particularly the Republicans
(who from Washington provided more strategic and logistic help in
beating Duke than was generally realized).
     1) Even with all the incredibly heavy baggage carried by Duke,
Democrats still showed they have a terrible time getting white
votes in the South--particularly white, middle-class males. While
Duke's 55 per cent of the white vote was lower than conventional
Republican candidates get in Louisiana, he collected more than 60
per cent of white males, white Protestants and middle-income
voters.
     2) Apart from the catastrophe of Duke running as the GOP
candidate for governor, the state GOP was nearly wiped out. Lt.
Gov. Paul Hardy (R) was defeated for re-election, and Secretary of
State Fox McKeithen's (R) re-election was the only statewide win.
The state party is set back about 12 years by Duke.
     3) The GOP is not through with Duke. He seems set on
continuing his '92 game plan of running against Bush in the
southern primaries and then running back in La. either against Sen.
John Breaux (D) or Rep. Jerry Huckaby (D).
     4) Worst of all, Bush did not get the specter of DD off his
back. Democrats now will accuse any Republican, including the
President, who raises the quota issue of imitating David Duke (even
Edwards attempted it in his victory statement Saturday night).

SENATE '92
     In the wake of the Pennsylvania debacle, Senate GOP Campaign
Committee Chairman Phil Gramm (R-Tex.)is putting the best face on
it, saying the race showed that insiders are vulnerable and there
are more Democratic insiders than Republicans. The key, however, is
for Republicans to run on "issues not on your resume" as Gramm
thinks Dick Thornburgh did in Pennsylvania. But the bottomline
remains that the GOP has not been able to recruit top-drawer
candidates for several vulnerable seats.
     Dole was really stricken by the Thornburgh loss and what it
means for his leadership in the Senate. He never really expected to
be returned to Majority Leader after the '92 election, but worries
now of forces so depleted that he will be leading a corporal's
guard. If Thornburgh can go down in Pennsylvania, can the Demos
pick up open seats in Utah and Idaho?

SPECIAL REPORT FROM ISRAEL

     With bilateral talks between Israel and, separately, Jordan-
Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese likely to start soon, Israel
confronts severe problems. Reporting from the scene, we make the
following points:
     1) Pressures grow from American Jewish leaders for territorial
and political compromises with Palestinians, who gained stature out
of the Madrid meeting. An Israeli poll shows 70 per cent of Israeli
voters favor the land-for-peace concept, but leaders say no.
     2) Record unemployment plus huge costs of handling Soviet
Jewish emigres threaten Israel's worst economic crisis. Current
record jobless of 145,000 will swell close to 250,000 in 1992. The
state-controlled economy does not seem able to convert fully to
free-market.
     3) Despite a new settlement on the Golan Heights and three on
the West Bank, doubts increase as to long-term viability of
settlements. Jewish immigrants are being quietly steered to
settlements despite U.S. warnings. Government officials now fear
another major battle with President Bush in January over the $10
million loan guarantees denied Israel in September.
     4) But there is an up-beat note: private talks with top
leaders show definite movement toward a general agreement that
Israel not only must but will make real compromises at least on the
Palestinian question. Heavy political pressures from the Bush
Administration, U.S. Jewish lobby and Western Europeans are helping
change winds here in Israel, the most politically sensitive country
in the world.

MATCHING FUNDS:  DOLE CERTIFIED FOR BIGGEST PAYOUT TODAY

     The FEC has certified more than $37 million in matching
funds to go to 10 pres. candidates in the first pay-out for the
primaries.  The Treasury Dept. will make the disbursements today
but due to a shortfall in the presidential campaign fund, the
actual amounts sent will be less than the certified amount.  The
campaigns will receive the full allotment once the the fund is
replenished from checkoffs from '95 income tax returns.  During
the primaries, campaigns can qualify for federal matching funds
if they receive $5,000 in contributions of $250 or less per
indivudal in 20 states.  The govt. then matches contributions of
$250 or less raised by qualified campaigns.  In return,
candidates must abide by spending limits in the different states.

           AMOUNT CERTIFIED 12/27
Dole         $ 9,265,291
Clinton        9,014,645
Gramm          6,653,919
Buchanan       3,977,007
Alexander      3,226,450
Lugar          2,275,051
Wilson         1,591,393
Specter          988,976
LaRouche         261,235

NEW HAMPSHIRE:  DOLE RISES IN LATE-DECEMBER POLL

     16 delegates.  An American Research Group poll, conducted
12/19-22, surveyed 560 likely GOP primary voters; margin of error
+/- 4.2% (release, 12/27).

       12/19-22   12/5-7   11/8-9
Dole      42%       30%     27%
Forbes    11         9       7
Buchanan  10        13      17
Gramm      9         3       3
Alexander  6         5       6
Lugar      2         2       6
Dornan     1         0       0
Keyes      1         0       3
Taylor     1         0       0
Undec.    17        37      31

     Pollster Dick Bennett said the poll and focus groups "show
the negative advertising by Forbes aimed at Dole and Gramm has
backfired. ... Bennett said the ads have only strengthened the
loyalty of voters previously leaning toward Dole and Gramm"
(Rezendes, BOSTON GLOBE, 12/29).
     FINAL STAGE:  Manchester UNION LEADER's DiStaso writes the
NH primary "moves into its final, frenzied stage" today as NH
voters will be "bombarded" with TV, radio and mail messages for
the next six weeks (1/1).  Both Dole and Buchanan attended
Concord's famed "First Night" festivities.  300 revelers waited
in line to have their pictures taken with Bob and Liddy.  An
estimated 12,000 attended (Schmitt, CONCORD MONITOR, 1/1).

IOWA:  SIX WEEKS TO GO, LAST HURRAH FOR THE HAWKEYE STATE?

     25 delegates.  DES MOINES REGISTER's Yepsen writes for
"political addicts" it's already been a "long campaign" in IA and
the "most intense phase is just starting."  For "real people" the
campaign thus far has been "background music" and they are just
now tuning in.  It is possible '96 will mark the last time the IA
caucuses will "amount to much" as LA has successfully supplanted
IA's first in the nation status.  Up to now, "there's been little
movement.  Bob Dole is ahead."  But there is a "softness" to
Dole's support which leaves him "vulnerable."   The current
"flavor-of-the-month" challenging Dole is Steve Forbes, but
history shows such flavors "melt on caucus night for lack of
organization."  Forbes, Gramm, Alexander and Buchanan are all
"bunched up" behind Dole and anyone of them could finish second.
Polls currently show it will be Forbes, but county GOP officials
say it will "probably" be Gramm.  "The truth is, no one knows."
One thing certain: "whoever finishes in fourth place or below can
start to shut down their campaigns" (1/1).

SOUTH CAROLINA:  DOLE SLIPS, BUT SO DOES GRAMM

     37 delegates.  A Columbia STATE/WIS-TV poll, conducted
12/26-27 by Mason-Dixon/PMR, surveyed 427 likely GOP primary
voters; margin of error +/- 4.7% (1/2).  The SC primary is 3/2.

GOP PRIMARY   NOW   5/95      FAV/UNFAV    ID
Dole          40%   49%       46%/19%      100%
Gramm         17    22        35 /18       81
Forbes        14    --        34 /12       73
Buchanan       8     4        31 /32       93
Alexander      3     5        20 /11       59
Lugar          2     1        12 / 8       54
Keyes          0     0        11 / 6       44
Dornan         0     0        13 / 7       45
Taylor         0    --         3 / 5       31
Undec.        16    16

     ANALYSIS:  While Gramm "has practically moved into South
Carolina, turning it into a make-or-break state," he "has failed
to make any headway" against Dole.  Gramm SC dir. Jim Merrill
"downplay[ed] the lack of movement, saying things will turn
around when they start buying their own TV time this year":
"There's no doubt Forbes is climbing.  Let's face it: If you took
Gumby and spent a quarter of a million dollars, he would also
reflect well in the polls.  [Forbes is] kind of like a crazy
professor out there saying nice things about himself.  People
don't know that he's pro-choice, that he's probably more liberal
than Bob Dole is."  Pat Buchanan's "poor showing isn't
surprising, considering the issues driving the electorate."  The
poll shows voters are "far more interested in economic issues
than in the social issues he's more closely identified with"
(Scoppe, Columbia STATE, 1/2).
     DEBATE:  The SC GOP will hold a one-hour debate 1/6, to be
televised on CNN and WIS-TV.  At the close of filing 12/31, the
party reported Alexander, Gramm, Lugar, Buchanan, Forbes, Dole,
Taylor and Keyes will be on the SC primary ballot (SC GOP
release, 12/31).  Dornan did not file.

OTHER EARLY STATES:  A RHODE TO NOWHERE

     LOUISIANA (30 delegates):  USA TODAY's Keen profiles the 2/6
LA caucus battle between Phil Gramm and Pat Buchanan.  The other
candidates have pledged to stay out in deference to IA.  GOP
activist Bryan Wagner: "Unfortunately for Buchanan, Louisiana is
located next to Texas, and Gramm has spent years doing
fundraisers and making himself known and appreciated in
Louisiana."  Buchanan predicts he'll "take delegates away from
Gramm in his own back yard": "[Gramm] came down here on the
proposition that he's the only one who can beat Dole.  Well, Phil
knows he's now in the race with an authentic conservative. ... If
we can come out of Louisiana with a dramatic showing, I think
it's all over for Phil Gramm" (1/2).  Morry Taylor and "several
Louisiana residents" filed a lawsuit to block the LA caucuses,
contending the event violates the Voting Rights Act,
discriminating against minorities by making it more difficult for
them to participate.  LA also holds a 3/12 primary, but the bulk
of delegates are selected 2/6.  IA GOP Chair Brian Kennedy
"praised" Taylor for "taking action" (Yepsen, DES MOINES
REGISTER, 12/23).
     DELAWARE (12 delegates):  Only Phil Gramm and Steve Forbes
have filed for the GOP primary so the chairs of DE's two parties
want the DE legislature to pass a law that allows the parties to
have the power to place candidates on the ballot (DiStaso,
Manchester UNION LEADER, 12/28).  At the 12/27 filing deadline,
ex-Gov. Elbert Carvel, 85, filed as the only other candidate on
the Dem primary ballot, besides Lyndon LaRouche.  Carvel is on
the ballot to keep LaRouche from winning delegates.  Carvel said
he would surrender his delegates to Pres. Clinton.  Clinton did
not file due to the state's decision to hold its primary inside
the NH's one-week "window" on 2/24.  If LaRouche were to win
delegates, the DNC would undoubtedly deny credentialling them, as
the party has not sanctioned DE's primary date.
     RHODE ISLAND (16 delegates):  Three candidates failed to
qualify for the 3/5 RI GOP primary ballot.  The official ballot,
as announced 12/28 by RI Sec/State James Langevin (D), does not
contain the names of Phil Gramm, Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes.
1,000 valid signatures were required to qualify.  The Buchanan
campaign, just 19 signatures short, said it would challenge the
decision.  The Gramm campaign said RI was not a big priority and
would focus on other states that day.   Alexander manager Dan
Pero: "The Gramm campaign has spent $20 million winning straw
polls, but it doesn't even get on the ballot in a state with real
delegates" (release, 12/29).
     MINNESOTA (33 delegates):  Dole "has largely fallen off the
radar screen" in MN, a state he won in '88.  His once "small
presence" in MN "disappeared completely" when a small office was
shut down.  Dole aides "dispute that it was even a campaign
office, but backers see the move as virtually conceding" the 3/5
MN caucuses to Phil Gramm.  MN GOP chair Chris Georgacas:
"There's no question Gramm's got a very strong organization built
down to the lower echelons of the party."  Conservative activist
Allen Quist: "Dole does not receive much enthusiasm from
conservatives" (Glover, AP, 12/30).

NATIONAL ISSUES CONVENTION:  LIST OF NO-SHOWS GROWS

     The Nat'l Issues Convention -- a four-day conference to take
place in Austin, TX 1/18-21, billed as an "experiment in informed
democracy" -- is "having difficulty wooing presidential
candidates to participate."  Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander have
already declined invitations, and a Phil Gramm spokesperson said
Gramm "likely will not participate."  Only Steve Forbes said he
would go; neither Pres. Clinton nor Pat Buchanan has announced a
decision on attending.  Univ. of TX's James Fishkin, one of the
convention organizers (along with PBS), said the NIC was supposed
to be a "social science experiment and not a candidate forum,"
with about 600 people picked randomly from across the nation to
learn about issues.  Fishkin: "The candidates who want to speak
to the concerns of the public can do so. ... We think that in the
long run we will have more participation than you think" (Walt,
HOUSTON CHRONICLE, 12/28).

DOLE:  GET READY FOR THE CAVALCADE OF GOVS

     DES MOINES REGISTER's Yepsen reports the Dole campaign is
planning a 1/6 rally in Des Moines to showcase some of the 20 GOP
gov. endorsements they have.  There are currently 31 GOP govs.
nationwide (including LA's Foster).  IA Dole manager Darrell
Kearney expects "at least" 9 or 10 govs. will attend, that will
be followed by "caucus training session" in some of IA's larger
cities to work on "boosting turnout" and generating some media
attention.  Kearney: "It's quite a coup for us to have these
governors here blitzing the state" (12/29).
     THE FEAR FACTOR:  Dole Dep. Chair Bill Lacy: "I am more
scared of this campaign making a mistake than anything the other
guys can do. ... We are in control of or own fate at this point.
I don't think there is a single thing out there that Phil Gramm
or Steve Forbes or Lamar Alexander or Pat Buchanan can do that
could sort of alter the dynamics of the race so fundamentally
that it would deny us the nomination" (Raasch, GANNETT, 12/28).
     THE AGE FACTOR:  BOSTON GLOBE's Nyhan, urging Lamar
Alexander to utilize the age issue, notes the Pope was born
5/18/20, Dole 7/22/23 (12/27).  NEWSWEEK's Fineman profiles Bob
and Liddy Dole under header, "This is their Washington life --
the one you won't see in Dole's campaign ads" (1/8 issue).
     NEW ADS:  Dole's campaign began running new ads 12/22 in NH
and IA.  IA FULL TEXT ("One of Us/Midwestern Values"; 30 secs.,
produced by Stuart Stevens) -- DOLE: "As a young man in a small
town, my parents taught me to put faith in God, not government
and never confuse the two."  ANNCR: "Bob Dole's midwest values
make him one of us.  He's fighting for our conservative agenda:
1) Demanding Hollywood stop corrupting our children; 2)
Protecting our children's future with a balanced budget;  3)
Strengthening working families with a $500 per child tax credit.
Bob Dole. The character and courage to lead America" (AP, 12/28).

FORBES:  IN PERSON AND ON THE TUBE

     In a profile, N.Y. TIMES' Kolbert notes in his public
remarks, Forbes "mentions his opponents only in passing.  But in
his commercials, he takes aim at them directly.  He was the first
candidate in the race to run negative commercials, and his media
campaign has been devoted at least as much to attacking Mr. Dole
and Mr. Gramm as it has been to touting his own ideas."  Forbes'
ad strategy "is unusual for someone so little known.  Generally,
candidates try to establish their own credentials before starting
to attack their opponents, and even some of Mr. Forbes' allies
worry privately that the approach is flawed.  But at least for
now, it appears to be having the desired impact."  GOP consultant
Sal Russo, "who has conducted focus groups for Mr. Forbes but is
not working on his campaign": "He's rewriting the Presidential
rules."  Forbes manager Bill Dal Col "predicted Forbes would do
'exceptionally well'" in DE 2/24 and "forecasted a strong
showing" in the 2/27 AZ primary, "where the Forbes campaign
appears to be breaking spending records."  Gramm media adviser
Alex Castellanos: "Nobody wants to get chased down the street by
a mad billionaire with a squash racket. ... Money can buy you
love.  But it can't buy you the Presidency" (1/1).
     LATEST ANTI-DOLE AD:  The Forbes campaign began airing a new
TV ad.  ANNCR: "A choice for Republicans on wasteful spending.
Million dollar pensions for Congress paid for by taxpayers?
Steve Forbes says no, politicians shouldn't receive taxpayer-
funded pensions.  Bob Dole says yes.  Bob Dole voted to increase
tax-payer-funded congressional pensions.  Two men.  Different
values.  Bob Dole -- Washington values.  Steve Forbes --
conservative values" (Forbes release, 12/21).
     FLAT TAX:  TIME's Birnbaum writes "the flat tax is becoming
the hottest new issue" in the race.  On 1/9, Jack Kemp's tax
reform commission "will make its own proposal to flatten the
federal income tax."  Bob Dole, a co-sponsor of the commission,
"is expected to endorse it."  The idea "is picking up so much
steam that the real estate lobby is planning" to broadcast radio
ads in IA and NH "to pressure candidates not to make their tax
plans too flat" (1/8 issue).

GRAMM:  FAULTS DOLE IN BUDGET BATTLE

     At breakfast with 150 IA supporters, Phil Gramm "criticized"
GOP leaders -- Bob Dole "in particular -- for bungling the
federal budget battle."  Gramm "said Dole ... has failed to get
the Republican Party's point across in the debate": "This is one
of those deals where virtually everything our leadership has done
has been a mistake and everything Bill Clinton has done has been
right politically. ... When was the last time you heard Bob Dole
give a response to Bill Clinton where you said, 'That hit is
exactly on the head'?  I can tell you I don't remember the last
time it happened."  Gramm added that failure to deliver the GOP
message to voters is giving Clinton the edge in opinion polls,
and may lead to his re-election: "If we're going to deliver it,
we're going to win or lose against Clinton based on our ability
to communicate with independents, conservative Democrats, blue-
collar workers, people who get their hands dirty working for a
living.  I believe I can do that.  I think there's no chance in
this world Senator Dole can do it."  He said a GOP compromise on
the budget would cause voters to lose confidence in the party:
"Republicans did not say we would balance the budget only if Bill
Clinton joins us.  We didn't say we'd balance the federal budget
if it's easy.  We didn't even say we would do it if it was
popular.  We said we would do it. ... If we don't live up to the
commitment we made in 1994, how is anybody going to believe
anything we say in 1996?" (Hartman, DES MOINES REGISTER, 12/29).
     WINS DOLE BACKERS IN IA:  Two of Dole's IA county chairs
have switched to Gramm, "who they say is stronger anti-abortion
advocate."  Dallas Co. co-chair Peggy Hermann and Warren Co. co-
chair Terri Hall "said Dole has waffled on the abortion issue."
Hall: "[Dole] led me to believe he was 100 percent pro-life --
clearly he is not" (REGISTER, 12/29).
     TRASHES THE BUREAUCRATS:  Gramm, on "Brinkley": "Have you
missed the government?  I mean, doesn't it strike you funny that
200 government -- 280,000 government employees -- are furloughed,
large segments of the government are shut down.  I think this
proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that we need to go back and
eliminate another 150- to 200,000 bureaucratic positions in the
federal government."  Gramm asked whether his campaign was
"washed up": "I believe that I am in good shape in Iowa, I think
we're building a base of support in New Hampshire.  There are
only two candidates that have a nationwide organization.  There
are only two candidates that in the end can win the nomination,
and they're Bob Dole and myself" (ABC, 12/31).

ALEXANDER:  SAYS FOCUS ON BALANCED BUDGET HURTS GOP

     Lamar Alexander in IA 12/28 said the "preoccupation" of
other GOP candidates with balancing the federal budget is
"playing into President Clinton's hands."  Alexander said neither
Bob Dole nor Phil Gramm is providing voters with "a vision of
America's future."  Alexander: "We've got nobody talking about
what kind of country we're going to have or how we're going to
get there.  We've got a lot of people talking about less from
Washington and nobody is talking about more from us.  If all we
can talk about in the next year is balancing the budget, if we
have no more vision than that, Bill Clinton is going to be the
next president of the United States of America and he's going to
have a Speaker Gephardt to work with."  The budget impasse in
Washington has given Alexander a "fresh context for his anti-
Washington theme."  He stressed GOP leaders should "stand firm"
on their budget priorities, but he said he would focus on other
goals like creating jobs and rebuilding communities (Roos, DES
MOINES REGISTER, 12/29).
     "SEVERITY WITH A SMILE":  NEWSWEEK's Klein writes Alexander
"has a rare political talent, the ability to make the radical
sound reasonable."  This ability would "seem a marketable quality
in our overripe era.  But it hasn't clicked ... One problem
Alexander won't -- can't -- acknowledge is that he's chosen the
wrong central organizing gimmick for his campaign.  He is running
as that hoariest of political cliches, the 'outsider.'  It seems
a threadbare conceit, too slick by half for the '90s. ... A more
profitable route might have been to emphasize his low-key style;
a calm, smart, reasonable person in a party that seems mesmerized
by its lunatic fringe."  Still, despite his problems, the race
"may be ready for a late-breaking dark horse" and Lamar has
"begun to position himself cleverly" by "courting the GOP's
smarter cadres, the neoconservatives and 'empowerment' activists
who cluster around Newt Gingrich and Bill Kristol."  Lamar will
give a speech incorporating their ideas and offering a "New
Citizenship" this week.  Alexander "has belatedly recognized
Ronald Reagan's great secret: Republican primary voters like
their severity with a smile."  He ran "the cleverest ad of the
campaign so far" over the holidays "tweaking" Gramm and Forbes
for their negative ads and offering a "different message in
rebuttal" (1/8 issue).
     THE AD:  The 30-sec. "5th Grade" spot featured Lamar walking
between TV monitors showing the Gramm and Forbes negative ads.
The spot ran over the holidays and is now off the air.  TEXT
(produced by Murphy Pintak Gautier): "Here they go -- Washington
mudslinging.  These guys act like they are running for president
of the 5th grade.  I'm Lamar Alexander.  My campaign is
different.  In January, I'll be talking about my ideas for good
jobs, better schools, and strong citizenship.  Where we expect
less from Washington and more from ourselves.  But this week,
while the others are so busy telling you their best insults, I
have something to say to you as well.  Have a Merry Christmas and
a Happy New Year!" (release 12/21).
     RESN REWIND:  In a front page story, W. POST' Marcus &
Babcock reported on the Alexander campaign's release of documents
showing the candidate raised "millions of dollars" for the
Republican Exchange Satellite Network -- which he founded in 1993
-- and that those donors "later formed the financial base" of his
campaign.  Center for Public Integrity's Charles Lewis called
RESN "a rather thinly disguised campaign mechanism" which was not
subject to FEC rules.  Alexander comm. dir. Mark Merritt called
Lewis' assertion "totally false" and said while it might have
offered him a platform, the primary purpose of RESN "was never to
elect Lamar Alexander president."  The POST ran a list of those
who gave RESN $100K or more (12/30).

BUCHANAN:  AIRS RADIO AD IN NEW YORK, WANTS TO REACH BALLOT

     Pat Buchanan released a "last-minute" radio ad attacking
NY's GOP leadership and primary process.  Only Bob Dole, who is
supported by Sen. Al D'Amato (R) and Gov. George Pataki (R) is
expected to "easily qualify" for NY's ballot.  The rest of Dole's
rivals, except Buchanan and Steve Forbes, have "written off" NY
and its 102 delegates.  Buchanan spokesperson K.B. Forbes said
the ads were designed "to boost up numbers" on petitions to reach
the ballot in each of NY's 31 counties.  The petitions are due
1/4.  AP's Humbert: "Notable is that Buchanan avoids attacking
D'Amato and Pataki ... by name in the ad. ... The late appearance
of the radio ad in select markets across the state indicates two
things:  Buchanan believes New York could be a key battleground
and he is worried about being kept off the battlefield" (12/28).
     "FACE"-ING DOLE:  Buchanan, on "Face the Nation," when asked
if he could support Bob Dole as the GOP nominee if he chooses a
pro-choice VP: "Bob Dole's a friend of mine. ... I deeply regret
that he moves around on every single issue. ... If Bob Dole picks
a liberal running mate, he will risk a real debacle at the
convention, but we're not going to have that problem because Bob
is going to be standing up there nominating me for president of
the United States" (12/31).
     WON'T BE EXCLUDED FROM WMUR DEBATE:  After announcing 12/20
that Buchanan would be excluded from a 2/15 debate, WMUR-TV
reversed itself 12/22.  Buchanan will be allowed to participate
(Manchester UNION-LEADER, 12/22).
     WON'T MISS DEFECTORS:  Responding to the defection in IA  of
Marlene Elwell and Guy Rodgers, Buchanan aides said the two are
"consultants who went to work for candidates who paid them more
 ... [but] have no knowledge of campaign secrets that might be
turned against Buchanan" (Yepsen, DES MOINES REGISTER, 12/27).

LUGAR:  MIXED REVIEWS OF BOMB THREAT ADS

     A Manchester UNION LEADER editorial: "Whoever Dick Lugar
hired to produce his latest series of TV ads raising the specter
of nuclear terrorism should be given the boot. ... The ad
campaign is a dud. ... Even as a scare tactic the ads come a
cropper.  The 'spine chilling' spots are so hokey as to be funny.
Somewhere Ed Wood is grinning ear to ear" (12/26).  W. POST
editorial: "A certain amount of the tut-tutting the ad has
occasioned seems to us misfocused.  The sensationalistic quality
of the message ... does not fit with the persona of Mr. Lugar and
diminishes him by making him look a bit desperate. ... But that
is not the most troublesome part of the story.  What's
troublesome is what the ad says ... about the apparently
universal understanding of what it finally takes to win attention
-- and support -- in politics" (12/31).

CLINTON:  A SPRING OFFENSIVE?  THE REAGAN PLAYBOOK?

     NEWSWEEK's "Periscope" reports Pres. Clinton's re-election
strategists are focusing on a likely Dole nomination and "expect
Dole ... to be cash-strapped by early spring ... and they're
hoping that moment of weakness will allow Clinton, already flush
with about $28 million, to 'do some real damage' to Dole, who
will be 'out of money and a sitting duck" (1/8 issue).  U.S.
NEWS' "Washington Whispers" reports strategists are urging
Clinton to formally announce for re-election the week before the
2/12 IA caucuses.  "The reason: to make political mischief."
They say announcements in IA and NH on 2/8-9 "would divert
publicity from the GOP.  It would also let Clinton fire a few
rhetorical shots that might capture voters' attention. ... Aides
believe that an effective theme" against Dole would be to cast
Clinton as "the future," Dole as "the past" (1/8 issue).
     REAGAN REDUX:  In an interview with AP's Fournier, Clinton-
Gore dep. chair Ann Lewis pulled out a binder entitled, "Reagan-
Bush '84, Review and Analysis," and said, "This is my Bible.
These are my secrets."  Although saying she was using hyperbole,
Lewis admitted, "I use the Reagan campaign for a lot of my
pointers.  What they did well was make it clear what Ronald
Reagan did, and why he did it."  Fornier reports one Clinton
campaign slogan "under discussion" is "Leadership for the
Future," which is meant to "create the same warm, fuzzy feeling
conjured" by Reagan's "Morning in America" (12/28).
     HAPPY NEW YEAR:  U.S. NEWS' Barone calls Clinton "The dead-
end kid": "Clinton, who campaigned in 1992 as a champion of
change, seeking to win younger voters, is now campaigning as an
enemy of change trying to scare older voters. ... His previous
arguments -- that the [CBO] numbers that were the only good ones
in 1993 need not be used in 1995, that smaller increases in
Medicare spending like the ones his wife proposed are now vicious
cuts -- cannot be sustained. ... Clinton does well enough in the
polls when voters are asked about Republican proposals.  But in
the electoral endgame 11 months from now, voters will be asking
what both parties will do, and for that Clinton has no clear
answers -- or perhaps too many" (1/8 issue).

A FEW YEAR-END THOUGHTS

     BOSTON GLOBE'S SHRIBMAN: "For Bill Clinton, 1995 was the
year everything changed -- and yet nothing did. ... He is, in
short, once again strongly positioned to conduct a political
campaign but weakly positioned to exert political leadership"
(12/28).  N.Y. TIMES' MITCHELL & PURDUM:  "Clinton ... will run
on the record of a very different Presidency than he and his
supporters seemed to imagine when the man from Hope, the youngest
President since [JFK], came into office speaking of generational
and social change" (1/2).  ANALYST KEVIN PHILLIPS writes 1996
"looks like a minefield": "With no more than a bit of bad luck,
1996 could bring a recession, an unpopular U.S. military
involvement in Bosnia and the first case in U.S. history of the
president of one party and the speaker of the other party both
facing special investigative counsel."  As for the economy, "The
recovery that began in 1991 will be starting its sixth year in
1996 -- about as long as most cycles run.  But the GOP's
unpopular budget package puts the Republicans in a position to
pay for what may be a cyclical downturn, something they should
have thought of whne they approved the script.  A 1996 recession,
occurring while the Repoublicans have grabbed the economic-policy
ball, could make the Democrats' 1994 congressional election
disaster one of the great forward fumbles of modern politics"
(L.A. TIMES, 12/31).  TIMES' "Chronicles" flips the argument and
calls Bob Dole a winner of the week: "Worst season in decades
fuels talk of slowing economy on eve of election year" (1/8
issue).  BOSTON GLOBE'S CANELLOS: "So far ... the surprise is how
mild and statesmanlike the race has been ... Candidates seem to
be fighting to claim two titles, tax-cutter -- and nice guy.
Wedge issues are locked away, at least for now" (1/2).  BOSTON
GLOBE'S LEHIGH rates the GOP pres. candidates on the "substance"
of their candidacies:  Alexander "D";  Buchanan "A-";  Dole "C+";
Forbes "B-";  Gramm "B";  Lugar "F" (12/24).
     ELECTORAL COLLEGE COUNT:  W. TIMES' Lambro sees the GOP
nominee with a 197-153 electoral vote edge over Clinton.  But
when leaning states are added, the count is tied 242-242, with 54
EVs considered "tossup."  Tossup states: WA, IL, OH (1/2).

WHITEWATER:  WHILE YOU WERE AWAY ...

     NEWSWEEK's Hosenball & Isikoff report that one month after
Bill Clinton's election in '92, Tyson Foods general counsel James
Blair, the family friend who assisted Hillary Rodham Clinton in
her highly lucrative cattle futures investments in '79 and a
member of a "defensive research team" to fend off Whitewater
allegations, loaned Jim McDougal $1,000 so that McDougal could
buy the Clintons out of their Whitewater investment.  Atty Vince
Foster "handl[ed] the transaction."  Blair: "I didn't think the
Clintons should go to Washington tied in to McDougal."  Blair's
loan "is one more sign of the Little Rock crowd's strange
sensitivity about the scandal that would not die."  While an aide
to Senate Whitewater chair Al D'Amato (R-NY) said Clinton may
have violated financial disclosure laws by failing to report
Blair's loan as a "gift" to the Clintons, Clinton atty David
Kendall disagreed: "The money came from McDougal.  Legally,
there's no issue."  But just-released notes from a 11/93 meeting
by then-WH Assoc. Counsel William Kennedy say, "Blair could have
knowledge.  Could be source of money to allo McD to purchase
stock."  Writes NEWSWEEK, "The emerging record suggests that the
Clintons' friends were worried about something -- and the
behavior of the First Couple's advisers, both before and after
Foster's suicide, looks like a bungled cover-up" (1/8 issue).
     MCDOUGAL TO D'AMATO:  After a federal court refused
McDougal's demand that D'Amato "be subpoenaed to answer questions
about his Senate probe," McDougal called D'Amato a "crook,"
adding that he was disappointed D'Amato wasn't coming to Little
Rock "because nobody in Arkansas has seen a member of the Mafia."
He challenged D'Amato "to dueling lie-detector tests" that would
cover D'Amato's past ethics problems and "mob ties" (Galvin, N.Y.
POST, 12/29).
     NEW SUBPOENAS:  The Senate Whitewater cmte issued subpoenas
to hear from 16 Arkansans, including Gov. Jim Guy Tucker (D) and
Jim and Susan McDougal.

GINGRICH:  A HAPPY NEWT YEAR?

     Speaker Newt Gingrich, appearing on CNN's "Evans & Novak,"
was asked about his high disapproval ratings: "If I were the
person they see in seven-second sound bites, I wouldn't like me
either" (12/30).  U.S. NEWS' Borger writes, "The professor needs
time to explain himself, but that is not how his world works.
Unless the networks invent the 35-minute sound bite, Gingrich
will remain difficult to stomach" (1/8 issue).  Gingrich, on the
Air Force One incident: "There's no question that there are times
that I describe that were like throwing an interception straight
into the other team's defense.  And on several occasions, and
that's one, I did things that weren't wise."  Gingrich, on what
he will do differently in '96: "Listen more carefully and try to
be more precise in what I'm saying. ... I think, frankly, I'm
going to work harder at interacting with individual editors and
individual reporters to try to see if we can't get our story
through, if by no other means, than just embarrassing them into
being professional."  Commenting on the president's persona,
Gingrich said that it is "almost impossible to be in a room with
Bill Clinton and not have some sense that you're dealing with
just an extraordinarily charming person" (CNN, 12/30).
     FROSH FOLLOWERS:  Rep. Zach Wamp (R-TN), asked whether
Gingrich has the freshmen's "proxy" in the budget negotiations:
"The Republican freshmen are the ones that have forced the
principal issues time and time again.  And the leadership has
come back to us, over and over again, and said: what will you
agree to? ... If we stick to the agenda of the Republican
revolution, not the personality of the speaker or the president
or other personalities, we're going to win because we're on solid
ground."  Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI), asked if he was prepared to
go the last mile for Gingrich: "I always look at Speaker Gingrich
kind of like I look at a basketball team, where Speaker Gingrich
is the point guard, and maybe [House Budget Chair] Mr. Kasich and
Gingrich together are the point guard on this team.  The rest of
us make up the rest of the team" ("Meet the Press," NBC, 12/31).

OTHER STUFF:  SCHUNDLER SPILLS THE BEANS

     AT THE RENAISSANCE/DARK AGES WEEKENDS:  Pres. and Mrs.
Clinton arrived in Hilton Head, SC on New Year's Eve in time to
keep their 12-year streak of attending the event alive.  Perhaps
the most interesting revelation of the weekend came from Jersey
City Mayor Bret Schundler (R).  NEWSWEEK's Kosova reports
Schundler "sheepishly admitted he had cut taxes too quickly,
leaving his city with a budget shortfall" (1/8 issue).   About
1,200 attended Renaissance Weekend; about 300 attended the new
GOP-only "Dark Ages Weekend" at Miami's Doral Golf Resort,
organized by DC attys Laura Ingraham and Jay Lefkowitz.  Guests
received a set of rules including: "No group hugs" and
encouragement for wearing furs and using chlorofluorocarbons
(Burleigh, TIME, 1/8 issue).
     RUSH:  L.A. TIMES' Randolph reported "there is a faint whiff
of trouble" in Rush Limbaugh's "formidable kingdom."  Program
managers at radio stations that carry Limbaugh's show "have begun
complaining about a slight dip" in his ratings.  Why?  "In sum,
he is now a member of the conservative political establishment;"
the outsider is now an insider (12/28).

1996 PREDICTIONS

     GEORGE WILL: "The Republicans will gain seats in the House
and the Senate and will have enough to pass a balanced budget
constitutional amendment."
     SAM DONALDSON: "There'll be a serious effort to say NATO no
longer needs to exist because the Soviet Union doesn't exist."
     JIM WOOTEN: "If nothing goes badly wrong [in Bosnia], Bill
Clinton does not profit from that.  That becomes a kind of
political wash.  If something goes wrong, Bill Clinton is
seriously damaged by that" ("Brinkley," ABC, 12/31).
     DAVID BRODER: "I'm afraid that we may be in for another
negative campaign year, with a lot of talk about character and
age, and things that are a lot less important to most Americans."
     WILLIAM SAFIRE: "The Democrats are going to try to make the
issue abortion and gun control, and divide the Republicans on
that.  I don't think the Republicans will bite.  I think they'll
fuzz it up."
     ANDREA MITCHELL: "I wouldn't bet the ranch on this being a
Clinton-Dole race.  Republicans are getting increasingly nervous
about Bob Dole's ability to defeat a revitalized Bill Clinton.
 ... Since none of the other Republican candidates look like
winners, I wouldn't rule out ... Colin Powell."
     CHARLIE COOK: "You'll see Republicans picking up two to four
seats in the Senate, minimal changes in the House ... and a
presidential election between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole that will
be much, much closer than it looks right now."
     AL HUNT: "The presidential race will be very close -- that
Bill Clinton and the Republican nominee will go right to the
wire.  I also suspect there will be, at least, a third-party
candidate, probably Mr. Perot, and maybe one or two others."
     LISA MYERS: "Two of the biggest issues in 1996 will be
leadership and character, which is one reason I think Senator
Dole has a lot better chance against President Clinton than a
whole lot of people now think."
     PAUL GIGOT: "The big issue of 1996 is going to be character
-- President Clinton's and the country's. ... 1996 is going to
show that Dan Quayle was a man ahead of his time when he put
these issues on the table, or tried to, in 1992."
     JACK GERMOND: "If we assume that Bosnia doesn't go sour,
which would probably destroy the president's chances of being
re-elected ... I don't think the campaign of '96 is going to turn
on any of the things they're talking about now -- not the budget
or foreign policy. It's going to turn on Clinton's ...character."
     JAMES CARVILLE: "In the vice presidential selection -- my
prediction is Dole is going to pick John Engler of Michigan."
     JIM MIKLASZEWSKI: "Even though he says he's not interested,
Colin Powell will be Dole's running mate.  There could be as many
a four candidates on the ballot, including two independents. ...
As long as the economy's good and Bosnia and Whitewater are
quiet, he's still the favorite, because Bill Clinton is still the
best campaigner to ever hit the White House" ("Meet the Press,"
NBC, 12/31).
     KEN DUBERSTEIN: "Big political story of the year is going to
be the House freshmen and that they will by and large be re-
elected. ... Bob Dole is going to be elected president. ... No
Democrat, with the exception of Jimmy Carter in 1976, has gotten
more than 45.6 percent of the vote.  Bill Clinton can't get above
that, period."
     FRANK RICH: "I have to go with conventional wisdom and say
it looks pretty good for Clinton right now" ("Face the Nation,"
CBS, 12/31).

ILLINOIS:  DURBIN CHALLENGES KRISLOV PETITIONS

     Rep. Richard Durbin (D-20) has asked state election
officials to bar Clinton Krislov (D), a millionaire atty, from
the ballot because of "alleged wholesale nominating petition
irregularities."  Krislov filed 10,080 signatures by the 12/18
deadline and Durbin is challenging 9,200 of them.  Krislov called
the allegations "evidence that his candidacy was giving the
jitters" to Durbin (Secter, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/27).  More
Krislov: "I am the only serious candidate in this race who is 100
percent pro-choice, no restrictions."  He said Durbin, "who now
says he is pro-choice, 'voted 25 times with the radical right' on
abortion issues."  Durbin "has said he went to Congress as a pro-
life candidate, but switched to pro-choice in part because he
found that some pro-life advocates there were also against family
planning to reduce the number of abortions" (Schoenburg,
Springfield STATE JOURNAL-REGISTER, 12/28).  Other Dems: ex-
Treas. Pat Quinn, p.r. exec. Ron Gibbs, businessman Paul Park,
and Jalil Ahmad.  GOPers: LG Bob Kustra, state Rep. Al Salvi,
radiologist Robert Marshall, Wayne Kurzeja, and Martin Paul
Gallagher.  Primary: 3/19.

KANSAS:  FRAHM FROWNS ON SENATE BID

     LG Sheila Frahm (R), a moderate, said she would not run for
the seat being vacated by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R): "The right
thing for me to do in 1996 is to continue to serve my state as
lieutenant governor."  Frahm's decision leaves conservative state
Sen. Eric Yost (R) as the only announced candidate (Petterson,
K.C. STAR, 12/27).  Frahm acknowledged that her decision "leaves
the moderate wing of the Republican Party without a candidate":
"It's a very difficult decision. ... If I was the moderate
candidate, maybe there are others who were hesitant and may be
interested in stepping forward" (AP/WICHITA EAGLE, 12/27).
Possibles: frosh Rep. Sam Brownback (R-02), real estate exec/'90
gov. primary cand. Nestor Weigand (R), retiring Rep. Jan Meyers
(R-03), Treas. Sally Thompson (D), stockbroker Jill Docking (D),
and Dole aide Dan Stanley (R).  Filing deadline: 6/10.

LOUISIANA:  TAUZIN WON'T RUN, SHAKES UP POLITICAL LANDSCAPE

     The battle for the seat being vacated by Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston (D) was "turned on its ear" by the decision of Rep.
Billy Tauzin (R-03), a recent GOP convert who was considered the
"leading" Republican candidate, not to run.  Tauzin was seen as a
likely candidate when he switched parties in 8/95, but "said he
decided to stay out of the race because he is up for a key
chairmanship in the House": "I have been looking at the race for
some time, but there has been a new development."  He said the
retirement of Rep. Jack Fields (R-TX) "puts him in line" to chair
the subcmte on Telecommunications and Finance, which he called
the "most important subcommittee post in the House."  Tauzin said
he has been assured by the GOP leadership that he will head the
panel, assuming of course he wins re-election and the GOP
maintains control of the House.  Tauzin: "I think I can help
Louisiana better in that position than as a freshman senator.
The decision is best for me, personally, too."  The decision came
just three days after the release of a poll conducted of 800 LA
voters by Southern Media & Opinion Research, which showed Tauzin
and outgoing Treas./'95 gov. hopeful Mary Landrieu (D) the
"front-runners" in the race: Landrieu received 19% to Tauzin's
14%, with 22% undecided.  AG Richard Ieyoub (D) got 12%, with
everyone else in single digits (Wardlaw, N.O. TIMES-PIC, 12/27).
     OPEN THE GATES:  Rep. Jimmy Hayes (R-07), like Tauzin a
recent GOP convert, said he would get in and insisted he wasn't
dismayed by early poor numbers: "When I first ran for Congress,
my poll was 2 percent.  I won with 57 percent of the vote.  But I
ran when I thought I could win.  I wasn't interested in the
competition" (AP, 12/27).  Baton Rouge consultant Bernie Pinsonat
said that the election of Gov.-elect Mike Foster (R) "proved that
there's no longer any penalty for party-switching."  Ex-Gov. Dave
Treen (R), who flirted with the '95 gov. race, said he is
"interested if he can take care of the business obligations that
caused him to get out" of the gov. campaign.  Rep. Bob Livingston
(R-01), who had considered a Senate bid until he was named House
Appropriations chair, said Treen will be the "front-runner if he
gets in."  Also announced is ex-state Rep. David Duke (R), who
hasn't run for office since he "fared poorly" in the '92 GOP
presidential primaries.  State Rep. Woody Jenkins (R), the
"darling of religious conservatives" who has twice run for the
Senate, is interested in running, as are New Orleans
Councilmember Peggy Wilson (R) and oilman Pat Taylor (R).  Taylor
had announced but then withdrew because of illness; Livingston
"said he is recovering and may change his mind."  Ex-Gov. Buddy
Roemer (R) "has long wanted" a Senate seat, and some of his
backers "urged him to sit out the 1995 governor's race and wait
for the 1996 Senate race."  But Roemer ran and finished fourth.
No Republican has won a Senate seat in LA since Reconstruction.
On the Dem side, Landrieu said she is looking at the race, "but
at this time I'm leaning against it."  Rep. Bill Jefferson (D-02)
said he would run for the Senate when he pulled out of the gov.
race last summer, "but he would have to leave a safe House seat
to do so."  Pinsonat "said he thinks Fields will more likely"
run, especially if he loses in his battle to keep his CD intact
(Wardlaw, TIMES-PICAYUNE, 12/28).  Other possible cands.: Rep.
Richard Baker (R-06) and Insurance Commis. Jim Brown.

MASSACHUSETTS:  WELD DOES AN ABOUT-FACE ON PACS

     Gov. Bill Weld (R) is "tossing aside some of his political
principles" by agreeing to accept PAC funding for his race
against Sen. John Kerry.  Weld said in 9/93 that PACs "just try
to buy influence and buy incumbents. ... I'd like to see an end
to this type of money funding" in MA.  Now Weld is justifying his
switch on the grounds that Kerry -- not a "paragon of
consistency" either -- "refused to agree" to a $5M campaign
spending cap.  Kerry, a "self-styled advocate of campaign
reforms," has in the past promoted spending caps (BOSTON GLOBE,
12/24).

SOUTH CAROLINA:  STROM NOT STRONG IN NEW POLL

     A Columbia STATE/WIS-TV poll, conducted 12/26-27 by Mason-
Dixon, surveyed 427 likely GOP primary voters; margin of error
+/- 4.7% (STATE, 12/31).  Tested: Sen. Strom Thurmond (R), ex-
Gov. Carroll Campbell (R) and Sec/State Jim Miles (R).

THURMOND SHOULD ...
Not seek another term    59%
Run for re-election      33

WILL YOU VOTE FOR THURMOND IN PRIMARY?
Consider voting for someone else   56%
Will vote for Thurmond             44

PRIMARY MATCHUP
Thurmond       40%            Thurmond  53%
Campbell       37             Miles     26
Miles           8

     ANALYSIS:  Although the poll shows Campbell within the
margin of error of Thurmond, Campbell insisted he will not run
against him: "I'm for Strom Thurmond.  As long as he runs, I
support him."  Miles "is more elusive" about his plans.  When
asked the chances of his entering the race, Miles "side-stepped
the question entirely."  Although Miles "couldn't topple"
Thurmond, "his interest could spur others to run.  Associates say
Campbell will jump into the race if Miles does" (Scoppe, Columbia
STATE, 12/31).  Southern political analyst Earl Black: "The only
way for Republicans to lose that seat is for the Senator to go
for one more term when his day is past. ... People are looking
for somebody younger."  Although only educator Charlie Thompson
has entered the GOP primary, Miles, "a maverick Republican, is
believed to be positioning himself to run."  Miles recently
mailed a "cleverly worded fund-raising letter saying" SC's next
senator will be one "who can energetically advance the
conservative values of our state."  Left unsaid in the letter is
whether the next senator will be elected in '96 or '98 (Bandy,
STATE, 12/31).  Announced Dem: businessman Elliott Close.  Filing
deadline: 4/30.

ILLINOIS:  FILING DEADLINE 12/18, PRIMARY 3/19

     4th CD:  Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D) gets a primary challenge
from John Holowinski (D).
     5th CD:  Frosh Rep. Michael Flanagan (R) will face primary
challenges from Chester Hornowski and Charles Prignano.  On the
Dem side, state Reps. Rod Blagojevich and Nancy Kaszak are
considered the favorites; other Dems to file were Ray Romero and
Eric Puchala.
     7th CD:  Retiring Sen. Paul Simon (D) has endorsed Cook Co.
Commis. Danny Davis for the seat being vacated by Rep. Cardiss
Collins (D).  Simon: "I think he has the stuff that real leaders
are made of" (Kuczka, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/18).  Other major Dem
candidates in the overwhelmingly Dem CD: Chicago Aldermen Dorothy
Tillman, Ed Smith & Percy Giles, and Cook Co. Commis. Bobbie
Steele.
     8th CD:  Don Huff (R), a political neophyte who was laid off
last summer as a manufacturing sales mgr., filed against 14-term
Rep. Phil Crane (R), calling for a "less confrontational
atmosphere" in DC and taking "more moderate positions" than
Crane.  Huff called the uphill battle a "Donald versus Goliath
fight" (Martinez, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/19).
     9th CD:  Given the large number of Dem retirements, "no one
would have second-guessed" Rep. Sidney Yates (D) if he decided to
join the crowd; Yates is 86 and was first elected to the House in
'48.  But "to the surprise, and mild consternation" of some, he
filed for a 24th term.  Atty J.B. Pritzker (D) filed but "said he
would withdraw by the January deadline if Yates remains a
candidate."  Other Dems: Terrence Gilhooly, Mark Matheney and
Seth Tillman (Pearson/Fegelman, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 12/12).
     10th CD:  Businessman Richard Rinaolo (R) has filed against
Rep. John Porter (R), calling for a "sweeping joint agreement to
prohibit acceptance or use of out-of-district PAC money."
Rinaolo: "It's time to stop preaching about campaign finance
reform and start practicing it. ... Porter, despite his pious
professions, has been part of the problem, not part of the
solution."  Rinaolo calls himself a "staunch supporter" of the
GOP Contract, while Porter "has alienated many Republicans by
voting against half of the Contract" (Rinaolo release, 12/26).
     20th CD:  In the race to succeed Senate candidate Dick
Durbin (D), the top ballot spots went to Bill Owens (R) and John
Glynn (D).  Also running: state Rep. Jay Hoffman (D), Madison Co.
Treas. John Shimkus (R), state official Patrick Baikauskas (R),
Sangamon Co. Circuit Clerk Carl Oblinger (R), student Dave Green
(R), atty James Zerkle (R), Rick Angel (R), and Sam Cahnman (D)
(Springfield STATE JOURNAL-REGISTER, 12/28).

MD 07:  THIRTY-TWO VIE TO REPLACE MFUME

     A record 32 candidates -- 28 Dems, 4 GOPers -- filed by the
12/26 deadline to succeed Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D), who is resigning
effective 2/15 to head up the NAACP.  The field includes state
Sens. Delores Kelley (D) & Nathaniel McFadden (D), Dels. Clarence
Davis (D), Elijah Cummings (D), Salima Mariott (D) & Kenneth
Montague Jr. (D), plus several clergy members including Baltimore
City Register of Wills Mary Conaway (D) and Rev. Frank Reid III
(D), who leads a 10,000 member church and is the brother-in-law
of Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke (D) (Zorzi, Balto. SUN, 12/27).
The seat has "historically been" held by a resident of West
Baltimore City, but with a large field and redistricting that
extended the CD further into E. Baltimore and Baltimore Co.,
nothing is certain.  The only major candidate with ties to
Baltimore Co. -- "where nearly a third of the vote lies" -- is
Kelley, who "could be the beneficiary of a race with a large
number of city candidates" because her district "straddles"
Baltimore City and Baltimore Co.  State Del. "Pete" Rawlings (D):
"It is creating a situation where [Kelley] has an excellent
chance.  Reid lives in the County, but has few political or
church ties there" (SUN, 12/26).  Mfume said he did not think he
would make an endorsement (SUN, 12/29).  Special primary: 3/5.

HOUSE HUNTING:  CHANGE OF HEART FOR BATEMAN

     TX 05:  Two Dems who were expected to run for the seat of
Senate hopeful John Bryant (D), Dallas school board pres. Sandy
Kress and atty Ken Molberg, will not.  A third potential Dem,
John Pouland, who like the other two is an ex-Dallas Co. Dem
chair, "said he is still on the fence."  Dems thought that Kress
"might have been the best-positioned to finance a Democratic
campaign."  He was expected to run in '90 when Bryant toyed with
a bid for AG.  Molberg said he didn't have enough money to make
the race: "That was the only thing that stayed in the way.  This
is a district that is tailor-made for an anti-Gingrich message"
(Stahl, DALLAS MORNING NEWS, 12/29).  Two GOPers are already
running: businessman Pete Sessions, who won 48% of the vote
against Bryant in '94, and ex-Dallas City Councilmember Glenn
Box.
     TX 15:  State Rep. Renato Cuellar (D), a 68-year old nine-
year veteran of the TX legislature, became the third Dem to
announce for the seat being vacated by Rep. Kika de la Garza (D).
Other Dems in race: atty Jim Selman and businessman Ruben
Hinojosa (AP, 12/27).
     VA 01:  Rep. Herb Bateman (R), who during the '94 campaign
said that would be his last race, changed his mind and will run
for an eighth term.  He said the GOP sweep of Congress "has made
him more powerful and effective -- and eager to stay in office."
Bateman said his "health is not an issue," but he had bypass
surgery in '89, underwent radiation for prostate cancer in '92,
and "discovered during a routine examination this past July that
he had suffered a minor heart attack without realizing it while
the House was keeping a busy schedule."  1st CD Dem chair John
McGlennon said no Dems have come forward to run but promised an
"aggressive recruiting effort" (Petkofsky, RICHMOND TIMES-
DISPATCH, 12/30).

Komatsu residents file suit demanding halt to fighter flights+

KANAZAWA, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Residents around the Komatsu base of the Air Self-Defense Force
(ASDF) filed a suit Monday against the state demanding a halt to
fighter flights and compensation for distress caused by aircraft
noise.
     This is the third suit filed by residents of Komatsu, Ishikawa
Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast, demanding halt to flights to
military aircraft.
     In the suit lodged with the Kanazawa District Court, the 1,653
plaintiffs call for a halt to flights of both ASDF and U.S. military
aircraft between noon and 2 p.m. and between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m.
     They also demand 1.2 million yen for each of the plaintiffs for
the past distress caused by noise and 50,000 yen per month for future
distress.
     The plaintiffs say the Self-Defense Forces is unconstitutional.
     They also cited two incidents as illustrating dangers from the
base.  In October an F-15 fighter burst into flames after failing to
take off, and in November an F-15 fighter fired a missile which hit
and downed another F-15 while the two fighters were engaged in a
drill over the Sea of Japan.
     In December last year the Kanazawa branch of the Nagoya High
Court ordered the state to pay 180 million yen compensation to 213
residents out of 330 plaintiffs from Komatsu but rejected the
plaintiffs' pleas filed by 1975 and 1983 for a halt to flights and
compensation for future distress caused by noise.
     Neither the plaintiffs nor the government appealed the ruling.

Metropolitan panel calls for 'realistic' project review+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A panel advising Tokyo Gov. Yukio Aoshima recommended Monday
that a ''realistic review'' be conducted of the Tokyo metropolitan
government's waterfront development project.
     In a report submitted to Aoshima, the panel said the project is
already well under way, with a huge amount of money invested for
construction of a 63,000-population ''city'' in the area surrounding
the Tokyo Bay.
     The report also called for measures aimed at advancing
internationalization, more effective disaster handling, solving
various urban problems and deregulation of business activities.
     During the seven meetings since September, the panel was split
between members calling for a sweeping review of the project and
those arguing for maintaining it, panel members said.
     The panel was established as a private advisory group by
Aoshima, who pledged a review of the project in his election campaign.
     Aoshima has reassured executives of companies planning to invest
in the waterfront development project, saying he plans to continue
the project.
     Aoshima dismayed some business concerns when he canceled an
international city expo that was set to open next spring, a pledge he
had made during his election campaign.

     U.S. President Bill Clinton is likely to make a three-day state
visit to Japan on April 16-18, rescheduling one that was canceled in
November, the top government spokesman said Monday.
     ''We will officially announce the schedule tomorrow afternoon,''
Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press conference, adding
that the Japanese and U.S. governments are close to agreeing on the
schedule.
     Besides meeting Emperor Akihito, Clinton will hold talks with
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and they will issue a joint
statement on the bilateral security system.  He also hopes to talk
directly to the Japanese public to stress the importance of the
security arrangements, Nosaka said.
     The joint statement is expected to include mention of the two
governments' efforts to reduce U.S. bases in Okinawa, following the
rape of a local schoolgirl in September, for which three U.S.
servicemen are on trial.
     Clinton was scheduled to visit Japan in November to attend the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum gathering in Osaka, western
Japan, and for a summit meeting with Murayama but postponed the visit
because of a federal budget crisis.
     The United States previously hoped to reschedule the visit for
early January, but Japan has declined the proposal because of the
emperor's tight schedule.  In February and March, Clinton will be
busy with presidential primaries.
     There still is a possibility that the April visit could be
changed because Clinton plans to attend a Moscow summit meeting on
nuclear safety in late April, government sources said.

SDP member resigns as head of policy research panel+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) resigned Monday
as chief of the party's policy research panel in protest over an
earlier decision by the SDP's policy-making Central Executive
Committee to postpone disbanding the party and forming a new party
as originally set for Jan. 19.
     Nobuyuki Sekiyama, chairman of the SDP Policy Board, handed in
his resignation to SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, an advocate of
a scheme to change the SDP into a new ''liberal'' party with a better
chance of winning coming elections.
     Sekiyama is the second SDP member to quit a key party post in
protest over the Central Executive Committee's decision earlier this
month.
     SDP members are at odds over when to form such a new party, with
Prime Minister and SDP head Tomiichi Murayama cautious about setting
up such a party early but Kubo willing to see the SDP make the change.
     Kubo and his followers have failed in several attempts to build
a new party around the SDP out of concern over the party's sinking
profile in a political landscape dominated by the Liberal Democratic
Party, the biggest group in the tripartite ruling coalition, and the
main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party).
     Kubo himself has suggested he may step down as the party's No. 2
man at a party convention set for Jan. 19.

Okinawa mayor to refuse signing land-lease contract+

NAHA, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Okinawa Mayor Shusei Arakawa said Monday he will refuse to sign
a contract for renewal of leasing the municipality's land to the
U.S. military.
     The mayor told the city assembly that he will not agree to the
renewal of the lease of the land for use as an ammunition dump in
view of public opinion calling for scaling down of the U.S. military
bases in the prefecture.
     Okinawa will be the second city in Okinawa Prefecture to refuse
to renew a lease of municipal land to the U.S. military, following
the capital city Naha, which has decided not to renew a lease for a
naval facility.
     The city of Okinawa has to begin legal proceedings as early as
1997 for the renewal of the land lease, the contract for which
officially expires in 2000.
     The city owns 474 hectares of land which accounts for about
one-sixth of the Kadena ammunition depot of the U.S. forces.
     The city concluded the present lease contract before Arakawa
was elected mayor in 1991.

AIDS: no finished problem in Japan+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Health and Welfare Ministry official was recently quite
puzzled when she was asked a question, ''Is the AIDS problem in
Japan over now?''
     ''The questioner said, 'I haven't seen any AIDS-related stories
in newspapers or magazines recently,'' said Tamami Umeda, deputy
director of the ministry's AIDS, TB and Infectious Diseases Control
Division.
     Of course, the issue is not over.  According to the latest
announcement by the ministry's AIDS Surveillance Committee, 85 new
people with HIV and AIDS were reported in September and October in
Japan, bringing the official total to 4,003.
     The 85 cases comprised 60 Japanese and 25 foreigners.  The 60
Japanese cases were the largest number ever for a two-month period,
the committee said.
     The record, which would have made banner headlines a few years
ago, was almost invisible in the domestic newspapers.
     The only prominent news reports about the disease this year were
those about people, mostly hemophiliacs, who were infected with HIV
after being treated with contaminated blood-clotting agents.
     Of some 4,500 hemophiliacs in Japan, an estimated 2,000 have
contracted the virus in the 1980s from HIV-contaminated blood
products imported mainly from the United States.
     Public calls for redress for those infected people have mounted
after the Tokyo and Osaka District courts in October proposed a
solution to suits filed by HIV-infected hemophiliacs, asking the
state and five pharmaceutical companies to compensate the plaintiffs.
     Umeda, while admitting the grave nature of the issue, criticizes
the media for being ''badly balanced'' in reporting on AIDS.
     ''The media focus on HIV infections caused by blood products is
increasing the number of people who do not think of AIDS as their own
problem,'' she said.
     ''Not many people are aware of the simple fact that anyone can
catch the virus through sexual contact,'' she added.
     Marii Goto, secretary general of the Japan HIV Center, a
nonprofit private group supporting AIDS patients, is also concerned
about growing public apathy.
     Since 1990, the group has been organizing the annual ''36 Hours
AIDS Hotline'' campaign around the Dec. 1 World AIDS Day, in which
volunteers throughout the nation offer information and counseling by
telephone.
     She said ''the telephones never stopped ringing'' during the
events in the first three years, with the 181 calls in 1990,
increasing to 1,771 in 1991 and further rising to 3,100 in 1992.
     However, to the volunteers' disappointment, the responses have
kept decreasing since 1993 to some 1,100 calls this year, Goto said.
     A government survey on the number of people who have visited
public health centers for HIV tests forms a similar curve -- peaking
in 1992.
     Goto said although less people are coming forward to undergo the
tests, the percentage of those tested who were found HIV positive
keeps increasing, indicating that the virus is spreading certainly in
Japan.
     Umeda said Japan may be in the stage of seeing HIV spreading
slowly, but steadly, a symptom which in the experience of many
countries was the precursor of a sudden surge.
     Goto said out of all the problems related with AIDS, she is most
anxious about the public becoming indifferent to the disease.
     ''I believe the antonym of love is not hatred, but disregard.
People who discriminate against AIDS patients can change their
thinking,'' she said.
     In explaining the transition of the public's attitude toward
AIDS, Goto said, ''First there was fear, which aroused interest.  The
level of interest peaked in 1992 when several foreign celebrities
like Magic Johnson announced they were infected, because Japanese
people love to keep up with foreign news.''
     But at the same time, the Japanese are the owners of transient
enthusiasm, and their interest in AIDS has faded, she said.
     ''Some people say the recurrence of fear, by telling how
horrible the disease is, would create public interest again.  But
such a method would only promote discrimination,'' she said.
     Goto believes that providing information on AIDS constantly is
the only solution, which is very dependent on the media and
administration.
     Umeda said the government expects private support groups to
reach out to certain communities in need of information about the
disease, such as gay people and foreigners.
     ''Our words would not influence them easily because they would
be guarded toward us,'' she said, adding the government hopes to help
private groups create a network among them by creating situations in
which they can exchange information.

Gov't adopts administrative reform program+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's cabinet Monday adopted a
program on administrative reform that calls for scrapping or merging
seven public corporations by the end of March 1997.
     The seven concerns include Livestock Industry Promotion Corp.
and the Japan Raw Silk and Sugar Price Stabilization Agency, both
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries.
     The program comes in line with a pledge made by Murayama to
streamline public corporations as part of administrative reform, a
policy target given priority by Murayama.
     The program also sets an April 1, 1997 deadline for the
government to abolish the salt monopoly under Japan Tobacco Corp. and
privatize a mutual fund for compensation of job-related injuries for
firefighters.
     It also stipulates that the cabinet's functions be strengthened
with the introduction of up to three advisers to the prime minister
so that the premier can receive vital information more quickly.
     The program requires the government to take into account
proposals by the Administrative Reform Committee, a government
advisory body, in reviewing the current deregulation program by the
end of next March.
     Among other policy targets, the program calls for reducing the
number of public servants even after the current retrenchment program
expires at the end of March 1998.
     It also points to the need to streamline the postal service,
state forest business and national hospitals.

Gov't approves defense personnel shifts+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government defense council on Monday adopted minor
personnel shifts from the Self-Defense Forces to the Joint Staff
Council in fiscal 1996, beginning April 1.
     The Security Council of Japan, headed by Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama, decided to cut the number of staff members of the Ground
Self-Defense Force (GSDF) by 570, the Maritime Self-Defense Force
(MSDF) by 333, the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) by 349, and to
increase the Joint Staff Council staff by 1,202.
     The set number of members for the GSDF is 180,000, 46,085 for
the MSDF and 47,556 for the ASDF, but their actual numbers currently
fall short of the fixed figures.
     The council also endorsed equipment procurement plans under the
government plan for the fiscal 1996 budget, including 11 F-2 fighter
support planes and four F-15 fighter-interceptor planes.

Japan disappointed at French objection to its CE status+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     France's opposition to Japan's bid for observer status on the
Council of Europe (CE) is ''regrettable,'' Vice Foreign Minister
Sadayuki Hayashi said Monday.
     The Foreign Ministry's top bureaucrat made the remark at a news
conference, replying to a question about Japan's failure earlier this
month to acquire the status due to the French objection.
     Hayashi said Tokyo will ask Paris the reason for its opposition
and continue to seek to participate in the council's activities as an
observer.
     He brushed aside speculation that France's opposition was due to
Japan's criticism of French nuclear tests.
     The 38-member council, founded in 1949, aims to achieve a
greater unity among its members, to facilitate their economic and
social progress and to uphold the principles of parliamentary
democracy and respect for human rights.

Princess Chichibu's memoirs to be published in English+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The English translation of the memoirs of the late Princess
Chichibu, widow of Prince Chichibu and an aunt of Emperor Akihito,
will soon go on sale in Britain and the United States.
     It is the first time that memoirs of a member of the Imperial
Family have been translated into English for sale abroad.  The 1991
book, originally titled ''the silver bonbonniere'' will be called
''Silver Drum'' in English and published by the British publishing
house Global Oriental.
     The princess, whose given name was Setsuko, died in August at
age 85 of complications resulting from chronic heart disease.
     An acquaintance who knew her from her work as honorary president
of the Japan-Britain Society said, ''(Unfortunately) the translation
did not come out while she was still alive, but I think she would
have been delighted.''
     In the book the princess, who was born in London as the daughter
of a Japanese diplomat, describes her life with Prince Chichibu, whom
she married in 1928.  The prince, younger brother of the late Emperor
Showa, contracted tuberculosis in 1940 and died of the disease in
1953 at the age of 50.
     She also provided some detail about the realities of life as a
member of Japanese royalty.  British author Dorothy Briton, who lives
in Hayama, Kanagawa Prefecture, translated the memoirs upon
initiative by the son of Prince Mikasa, a cousin of the Emperor.
     Briton said she consulted the princess, who was fluent in
English, on the manuscript when about one third of the English
version had been completed.  She said the translation is a loose one
aimed at deepening understanding of Japan.
     Just four days before her death the princess was shown the cover
picture for her English-language memoirs.
     The first copy of the book was sent over from Britain at the end
of November and was put in front of the princess' mortuary tablet.
Briton said the book shows how Prince Chichibu's love helped turn her
arranged marriage into a fairy-tale love story.

Murayama aims to discuss Okinawa with Clinton+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said Monday he will discuss
requests from the southernmost Japanese prefecture of Okinawa to
reduce the number of local U.S. bases with U.S. President Bill
Clinton when he visits Japan in April.
     Murayama told reporters, ''We will discuss the adjustment and
reduction of bases giving due thought to the feelings of the people
of Okinawa.''
     ''We will discuss Japan-U.S. bilateral issues well, and the
Okinawa issue in particular.  It is important for us to speak
candidly with each other,'' he said.
     Tokyo and Washington are close to agreeing to reschedule
Clinton's state visit to April 16-18, following the cancellation of a
visit in November.
     The rape of a local schoolgirl in Okinawa in September, for
which three U.S. servicemen are currently on trial, stirred the local
Japanese populace to demand reductions in the large number of U.S.
bases which are concentrated there.

Kono lauds Japan's U.N. 'achievements' in '95+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said Tuesday Japan largely
succeeded in showing an active stance at the United Nations in 1995
on global peace and socioeconomic development.
     ''We made some achievements as far as our U.N. diplomacy is
concerned,'' he told a news conference in looking back on the past
year.
     As its major victory in the 185-member world body, Kono singled
out adoption of peace- and disarmament-related U.N. resolutions that
Japan proposed along with other countries, including a resolution
calling for an immediate halt to nuclear testing.
     ''I can safely say Japan is now in a position to take the
initiative in promoting disarmament, peace, nuclear nonproliferation
and stemming nuclear testing,'' he said.
     The foreign minister also said Japan played an active role in
the field of economic and social development in the past year, which
marks the 50th anniversary of the U.N.'s founding.
     Kono expressed disappointment, however, at a slower pace in U.N.
reform efforts.  He also said Tokyo will have to set a new strategy
for its U.N. diplomacy for 1996.

Murayama to meet Clinton, Yeltsin in April++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama will meet with U.S. President
Bill Clinton in Tokyo in April and is expected to confer with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow immediately thereafter,
the government said Tuesday.
     Clinton will make a three-day state visit to Japan on April
16-18 in place of one canceled in November, a top government
spokesman said.
     The Japanese and U.S. governments have officially agreed on the
schedule, with Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and Secretary of State
Warren Christopher discussing it over the phone, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press conference.
     Clinton will meet Murayama on April 17 and the two leaders will
issue a joint statement reconfirming the Japan-U.S. security
alliance, Nosaka said.
     The statement is expected to give a fresh significance to the
security system, while mentioning efforts to respond to wishes from
the southernmost Japanese prefecture of Okinawa to reduce the
concentration of U.S. bases there.
     Okinawa has stepped up demands for local base cutbacks following
the rape of an Okinawa schoolgirl in September, for which three U.S.
servicemen are currently on trial.
     The president also hopes to speak directly to the Japanese
public on the importance of the bilateral security arrangements,
according to government sources.
     Despite an international summit on nuclear safety set for April
19-20 in Moscow, the schedule of Clinton's visit will not be changed,
Nosaka said, adding that Japan and the United States have arranged it
very carefully.
     Murayama will attend the Moscow summit and a meeting with
Russian President Yeltsin is likely to take place, he said.
     Clinton originally planned to visit Japan in November to attend
a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in
Osaka, western Japan, and stay on for the state visit but postponed
the trip amid a federal budget crisis.
     The U.S. side previously hoped to reschedule the visit for early
January, but Japan declined the proposal because of the tight New
Year schedule of Emperor Akihito, with whom Clinton is to meet as a
state guest.
     In February and March, Clinton will be busy with presidential
primaries.

Hiroshima, Nagasaki to send A-bomb expo to U.S., France+

HIROSHIMA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only cities ever hit by an atomic
bomb, announced plans Tuesday to send an exhibition around the world
on a three-year mission to promote an end to nuclear weapons,
starting in the United States and France next year.
     City officials said they plan to stage the exposition for about
two weeks in the two cities a year over the coming three years.
     The two cities will send photographs and atomic bombing
artifacts for the first exposition in U.S. and French cities next
year, adding they want people to know the actual situation of
atom-bomb victims.
     The sites will be determined with the cooperation of 410 members
of the World Conference of Mayors for Peace Through Inter-City
Solidarity, an antinuclear group formed and headed by Hiroshima Mayor
Takashi Hiraoka.
     The mayor, through the cooperation of the two cities, took part
in an exhibition held at a university in Washington in July.
     In October, Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito visited France to protest
over the series of nuclear tests planned by Paris in the South
Pacific, the first of which was carried out in September.
     Both mayors expressed the feeling that there is a difference in
awareness concerning nuclear weapons between the citizens of the two
atom-bombed cities and nations that possess nuclear arms.
     They decided to organize the exhibition in order to inform more
people of the terrors of nuclear weapons, hoping this will eventually
lead to their elimination in the future.
     ''We are currently planning to hold this exhibition for three
years, but we would like to continue until nuclear weapons are
eliminated,'' said Hiraoka.
     Last week the mayors called on Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama
to make the holding of the exposition in various countries a national
project.
     They asked that the state cover the costs associated with
providing photographs and other materials about the 1945 atomic
bombings of the cities to other countries.

MOF releases transparent, stricter auditing measures++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura announced Tuesday a set of
measures to help Japanese banks strengthen their risk management,
auditing and checking systems as a way to prevent illicit financial
operations like the Daiwa Bank scandal.
     ''It is necessary for Japan to make a drastic shift in its
financial policy,'' Takemura said at a news conference, acknowledging
the Finance Ministry's failure in the past to adequately check
expanding bank operations after the onset of the ''bubble'' economy
in the late 1980s.
     To try to remedy the situation, he said the ministry will make
sure that two key principles will be established in Japan's banking
system -- self-responsibility of the sector and transparent financial
policy based on market mechanisms.
     Specifically, Takemura said, the ministry will introduce an
early warning system meant to detect irregularities in the banking
sector, such as the use of objective criteria for ordering business
improvements at faltering financial institutions.
     Banks with their capital-to-asset ratio below certain levels,
for example, would be ordered to rectify the situation under the
warning system, Takemura said.
     As a means to accurately assess the capital ratio and other
financial standings of certain banks, the new system will require
banks to entrust outside accountants with the auditing of their
financial records, Takemura said.
     The package also features expanding financial inspectors within
the ministry by 66 from some 400 people at present, Takemura said,
citing a larger scale of about 8,000 at U.S. financial authorities.
     The Daiwa scandal, which involved the cover-up of 1.1 billion
dollars in U.S. Treasury securities trading over 11 years from 1984,
undermined Japan's financial sector already battered by a series of
financial failures this year.
     Reflecting global concern over Japan's banking system, Japanese
banks have been slapped with the so-called ''Japan premium,'' or an
extra interest rate on their fund raising overseas.
     Takemura said the Finance Ministry's slowness in shifting its
policy from regulation-oriented protectionism to a policy based on
market forces has been partly responsible for the current lack of
self-responsibility at Japan's financial institutions.
     The recent series of financial failures and the Daiwa Bank
scandal stemmed from the banking sector's inadequate risk management
as they mistakenly perceived the extraordinary financial expansion of
the bubble economy as sound financial development, Takemura said.
     The Finance Ministry was looking the other way while the
situation was deteriorating, Takemura said, confirming the ministry's
role in the current problem with the banking system.
     Takemura also admitted that relations between the ministry and
the financial sector could be seen as ''nontransparent'' as its
instructions on key policies were not explained to the public.
     ''The early warning system and the outside auditing under the
new package will ensure objectivity in banking inspections and
increase a certain level of distance between authorities and
financial institutions,'' Takemura said.
     Takemura said the Finance Ministry promises immediate reporting
to local financial authorities in the case of new overseas scandals
involving Japanese financial institutions.
     ''The package will fundamentally change Japan's financial
policy,'' Takemura said.
     The introduction of the early warning system means that any bank
operating ineffectively would go under as a natural consequence of
the market mechanism, ministry officials said, in briefing reporters
on the package.
     ''The package is absolutely indispensable for Japan's financial
system.  The Japan premium will not be abolished unless Japanese
financial institutions correct their attitude,'' a senior ministry
official said.
     The package pushes financial institutions to improve their
internal inspection systems from fiscal 1996 starting next April, as
a lesson learned from the Daiwa scandal, the ministry officials said.
     To this end, the ministry will draw up a set of guidelines on
soundness of assets, operation in compliance with related laws and
regulations, risk management of market trading, including derivatives
deals, and computer system management, they said.
     The package also asks financial institutions to have outside
experts inspect their overseas operations, as well as to employ
internal auditors and compliance officers at their overseas branches,
who are to be independent from branch managers and report directly to
headquarters.
     As part of measures to secure sound banking operations,
financial institutions are also requested to give longer vacations of
some two weeks to employees.
     The Finance Ministry will translate data from internal
inspections by banks into credit ratings that show the soundness of
their capital and other financial conditions, the officials said.
     Banks with lower credit ratings will face closer scrutiny by the
ministry on their overall risk management, they said.
     With an eye to ways to prevent the recurrence of incidents such
as the Daiwa scandal, the ministry will increase the number of
overseas inspections, the officials said.
     For that purpose, the ministry will form a team specialized in
overseas examinations, the officials said, noting that some
inspectors will be stationed abroad.
     The Finance Ministry will keep in touch with its overseas
counterparts and share information on a regular basis, the officials
said.
     The range of mandatory reporting of financial accidents and
irregularities to authorities will expand to cover subsidiaries with
an equity holding by a parent firm of more than 50%, the ministry
officials said.
     Takemura said he hopes the fresh package will help lift
auditing and inspection levels in the Japanese banking sector to U.S.
levels in the near future.
     He said bills to revise relevant laws for the package will be
presented to the ordinary Diet session to be convened in January next
year.
     He added that steps that do not require any legal revision will
be implemented immediately.

     Kono and Christopher will discuss issues relating to bilateral
ties, including U.S. President Bill Clinton's state visit to Japan on
April 16-18, and major international issues, the ministry said.

100 new plaintiffs join HIV-hemophiliac suit in Tokyo+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Another 100 hemophiliacs who contracted HIV from contaminated
imported blood products joined a large-scale compensation suit
Tuesday against the state and five pharmaceutical makers that
marketed the products.
     The new group, which brings the total number of plaintiffs to
218, demands a total of 11.3 billion yen in compensation, swelling
the overall damages sought to 24.7 billion yen in the suit, pending
at the Tokyo District Court.
     The move comes after the Tokyo and Osaka District courts in
October proposed a solution to suits filed by HIV-infected
hemophiliacs, asking the state and five pharmaceutical makers to
compensate the plaintiffs.
     Some 1,800 people across Japan, almost all of them hemophiliacs,
have contracted the AIDS-inducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
from contaminated imported blood products.
     According to the plaintiffs' lawyers, more victims are
considering joining the suit in the wake of the proposed out-of-court
settlement.
     The latest plaintiffs group, the eighth, includes people from
five prefectures not previously represented in the suit -- Aomori,
Gifu, Mie, Tokushima and Kumamoto.
     The number includes a woman who contracted the virus when she
accidentally pricked herself with a syringe needle while
administering an injection to her hemophiliac HIV-infected child.
     Both courts are currently negotiating with the plaintiffs and
the defendants in an effort to reach an out-of-court settlement by
next spring.  The most recent plaintiff group would be covered by
such a settlement.
     In a first proposal the pharmaceutical makers have offered to
compensate each plaintiff with 45 million yen for the time being.
The courts are, however, expected to come up with a second proposal
mapping out a final settlement of the matter.

Agency warns of rising sentiment against U.S. military+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Public Security Investigation Agency predicted Tuesday that
the domestic movement against the U.S. military presence in Japan
and the U.S.-Japan security alliance will grow stronger in 1996, and
did not rule out illegal acts.
     ''Political extremists and the Japanese Communist Party are
expected to continue to try to fan the struggle against the U.S.
(military presence) and the bilateral security treaty,'' the agency
said in its outlook on domestic and international security risks.
     It warned that extremists could stage attacks particularly in
protest at the forced lease of private land to U.S. bases in Okinawa
Prefecture.
     Calls for a reduction of the heavy U.S. presence in the
prefecture have grown louder since the Sept. 4 rape of an Okinawan
schoolgirl, for which three U.S. servicemen are on trial.
     The report says that the religious cult AUM Shinrikyo emerged
this year as the perpetrator of an unprecedented series of crimes
such as the March 20 sarin attack on Tokyo subways.
     The agency launched measures toward dissolving the cult based on
the Antisubversive Activities Law because ''there is an evident
danger that the cult will engage in similar activities in the
future,'' the report said.
     Noting that ultranationalist extremists staged three guerrilla
attacks in 1995, which abounded with World War II commemorations, the
agency cites concerns that such activities might become more
pronounced depending on government and opposition politicians' views
on the nation's war guilt.
     As for the situation abroad, the report says North Korea has as
yet apparently refrained from officially naming a new head of state
following the death in July 1994 of President Kim Il Sung so as to
make use of the late leader's charisma, as the nation is faced with
natural disasters and international scrutiny over its nuclear program.
     It also said that the North's de facto leader, Kim Jong Il,
might hide behind the power of his late father, who wielded strong
influence over the military, to ensure the continuity of the
country's system.
     In China, a September reshuffle in the Communist Party's Central
Committee has strengthened President Jiang Zemin's camp, the report
said, while warning that domestic trouble first of all on the
economic front could unleash another struggle about the nation's
direction.

Shinshinto's new head likely to be chosen Wed.+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Ballot counting will begin Wednesday morning for the
presidential election of the main opposition Shinshinto (New
Frontier Party), with observers seeing the party's Secretary General
Ichiro Ozawa leading his rival Tsutomu Hata.
     If the counting go smoothly, the winner will be known within the
day and the new president will officially assume office at a general
assembly of the party's Diet members Thursday.
     Both declaring that, if elected, they would aim to wrest power
from the ruling coalition, Ozawa, 53, and Hata, 60, have run the
two-horse race since Dec. 16.
     Ending the campaign, Ozawa told reporters, ''I am pleased that
the party could discuss policy issues'' during the campaign.  Hata, a
former prime minister, said, ''I feel confident of victory.''
     By Tuesday, when postal voting ended, some 1.68 million votes
had been cast -- 220,000 by party members and associated members plus
some 1.46 million by other Japanese citizens aged 18 or older who
paid 1,000 yen each to vote.
     Ozawa's camp has expressed confidence of winning a majority by
securing at least one million votes, while Hata's camp predicts votes
ranging from 600,000 to 900,000 have already been obtained.
     According to a survey conducted by Kyodo News Service on
Shinshinto's senior local chapter members, Ozawa led Hata, but there
is uncertainty about how ordinary Japanese citizens have voted.
     Ozawa and Hata, though long-time allies, are seeking the
presidency after the first president, Toshiki Kaifu, decided not
to seek reelection, having thrown his weight behind Ozawa.
     Ozawa was instrumental in creating Shinshinto a year ago through
a merger of all the main opposition forces, excluding the Japanese
Communist Party.  Hata briefly served as prime minister while serving
as the head of one of Shinshinto's predecessor parties.

Member of SDP left-wing runs for party leadership+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     A leading member of the Social Democratic Party's staunch
left-wing said Tuesday that he will run for the party leadership
next month when Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's term as party
chairman expires.
     Tadatoshi Akiba, a House of Representatives member from
Hiroshima, telephoned Murayama of his decision to run for the
chairmanship in an intraparty election scheduled for Jan. 14-15.
     The outcome of the poll is to be announced Jan. 16 and a new SDP
leadership selected at an annual party convention set for Jan. 19.
Applications for candidacy will be accepted Jan. 5.
     Murayama, 71, has suggested he will run for another term as the
party's leader and different quarters in the SDP have been floating
different names as potential opponents.
     Akiba, 53, has been a member of an SDP group opposed to policy
changes within the party and to the formation of a new liberal party
sought by a right-of-center group led by the party's No. 2 man,
Secretary General Wataru Kubo.
     Akiba's group opposes the dispatch of Self-Defense Forces troops
to the Golan Heights in the Middle East on a U.N. peacekeeping
mission and is against any increases in Japanese military might.
     The group, the Roundtable to Guard the Constitution, went so far
as to hold its own celebrations in November to mark the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the socialist party.
     Eligible to vote in the January election are some 110,000 SDP
members and supporters who have been cooperating with the party for
more than a year.
     The SDP is a partner in the tripartite ruling coalition that
also includes the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and New Party
Sakigake, an LDP splinter group.

Local political funds hit 160 bil. yen+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Political parties and fund-raising organizations collected a
total of 159.5 billion yen in local political funds in 1994,
according to a count by Kyodo News Service from reports to
prefectural election administration committees.
     The amount was larger, for the first time ever, than the total
of political funds collected in Tokyo and reported to the Home
Affairs Ministry, which was 148.4 billion yen.
     In total, the political funds collected in 1994 amounted to
307.9 billion yen, down 6.8% from the previous year, for the
third consecutive year-on-year decline since peaking at 359.1 billion
yen in 1991.
     Local fund-raising parties with proceeds of 10 million yen or
more numbered 225, for total funds of 7.7 billion yen, marking a
2.9-fold jump.
     The Japanese Communist Party topped the list of the fund raisers
in the prefectures, with 29.2 billion yen, followed by the Liberal
Democratic Party with 14.9 billion yen, and the Social Democratic
Party with 6.6 billion yen.

Dailies cautiously welcome new Shinshinto chief Ozawa+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Major Japanese dailies gave a cautious welcome in their
editorials Thursday to the election of Ichiro Ozawa as president of
the main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party).
     ''Although there are various concerns, it is a good thing that
Mr. Ozawa has emerged as the starring figure at center stage from
backstage,'' the Asahi Shimbun said, referring to Ozawa's role as the
party's backstage power broker.
     ''It can at least be appreciated that Ozawa has tried to meet a
request for creating (two) opposing axes over ideology and policy,''
the Asahi said, in reference to Ozawa's claim that the Japanese
political system should become one dominated by two major political
parties.
     ''What the Japanese people should welcome is that 'the Ozawa
method' will be easier to be seen on the surface,'' the Mainichi
Shimbun said in reference to Ozawa's behind-the-scene political
maneuvering.
     ''Mr. Ozawa has never stood in the Diet for questioning as party
chief and for questioning before (the House of Representatives)
budget committee...Since he became secretary general of Shinshinto,
he has noticeably acted in secret as he has often been absent (at
party meetings)...This has provided an excuse for criticism of a dual
power structure (in Shinshinto), but it cannot be tolerated in a
party chief,'' the Mainichi said.
     The Yomiuri Shimbun said, ''With the election of Ozawa, said to
have been the party's backstage power broker, we expect Shinshinto's
'dual power structure' to end and the transparency in party
management to increase.''
     ''We also hope he delivers the 'easy-to-understand politics and
powerful execution' that he has been campaigning for.  Many of those
who voted for him must think the same way,'' the Yomiuri said.
     On Wednesday, Ozawa scored an overwhelming victory over his
long-time political ally, former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, to
become the head of Shishinto.

Murayama's new year visit to shrine OK, gov't says+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The government sees no problem in Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama paying a visit to Ise Shrine in Mie Prefecture in western
Japan on Jan. 4, a top government spokesman said Thursday.
     ''There are various arguments against visiting Yasukuni Shrine,
but prime ministers' visits to Ise have already become a customary
annual event,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press
conference.
     Answering questions about whether Murayama's Ise visit does not
violate the constitutional principle of separation of state and
religion, Nosaka said Murayama's Social Democratic Party has also
discussed the problem and agreed to sanction the visit.
     During the 38-year period to 1993 of single-party rule under the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), LDP premiers made it a rule to pay a
New Year visit to Ise.
     Ise Shrine enshrines the goddess Amaterasu, the legendary
ancestor of the imperial family, while Yasukuni Shrine enshrines the
Japanese military war dead.
     Murayama, who came to power in June last year, did not go to Ise
in January this year because of a cold.

     Takemura, appearing on an NHK TV program to be broadcast during

dissolved until the end of the Diet's 150-day regular session
beginning in late January.
     He also hinted that Sakigake, a splinter group of the Liberal

Tomiichi Murayama's Social Democratic Party, depending on its
policies.

Japan deplores 5th French nuclear test+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japan expressed strong dissatisfaction Thursday over the fifth
nuclear test this year carried out by France in the South Pacific on
Wednesday.
     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama told reporters that France ''has
said it will stop nuclear testing upon the conclusion of a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, but nuclear testing is
meaningless and France should stop it immediately.''
     Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka also expressed regret over
the nuclear testing, saying France's nuclear tests run counter to
international efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament.
     ''France said it would conduct one more test, but 'enough' is
the call of the world,'' said Nosaka, the chief government spokesman,
in a press conference.
     France detonated a nuclear device at Mururoa Atoll in French
Polynesia at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday local time, the fifth test since it
resumed nuclear tests in the South Pacific in September.
     France originally planned to conduct a total of seven or eight
tests, but the government said the number would probably be reduced
to six and that the current series of tests will be completed by the
end of February.
     Foreign Minister Yohei Kono summoned Denis Gauer, acting French
ambassador to Japan, to the ministry to protest the latest nuclear
detonation.
     Gauer told Kono that the sixth test would be conducted earlier
than the end of February.  Kono told the envoy that he cannot condone
further testing by France, officials said.
     Takashi Hiraoka, the mayor of Hiroshima, sent a letter of
protest over the nuclear test to French Ambassador to Japan
Jean-Bernard Ouvrieu on Thursday, urging France to immediately halt
its nuclear testing.
     Hiraoka said he feels ''strong anger'' that France defied the
Dec. 12 U.N. resolution calling for an end to nuclear testing.
     ''It is an action betraying the trust of the people of the
world, and is French egoism,'' Hiraoka said at a news conference.
     Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito said he cannot understand why French
President Jacques Chirac, ''who experienced wars,'' is still unable
to search for coexistence of the human race.
     Nagasaki Mayor Isamu Takada has also sent a letter of protest to
Ouvrieu, stating that the test ignores the world community's desire
for the abolition of nuclear weapons.
     The statement urged France to immediately cease the tests and
work for the early abolition of nuclear weapons.
     About 45 people, members of the Nagasaki Peace Workers' Center
and the Nagasaki chapter of the Japan Congress Against A and H Bombs,
staged a one-hour sit-in to protest the test in front of the bronze
Statue of Peace in Nagasaki Peace Park.
     About 30 members of the Nagasaki branch of a union of
prefectural workers staged a sit-in outside the prefectural
government headquarters and adopted a resolution urging nuclear
powers to promote nuclear disarmament and accept responsibility for
the continued existence of the earth and humankind.
     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura released a statement in his
capacity as leader of New Party Sakigake, saying France's dignity in
the international community ''fell to the ground'' in 1995.
     No matter excuses France makes, it conducts nuclear tests just
to protect itself and that can never be justified, Takemura said.
     Takemura drew international attention when he went to the French
Polynesian island of Tahiti in September to join in a rally to
protest against the French nuclear tests.
     Murayama's Social Democratic Party also denounced the nuclear
test, saying it ''could in no way tolerate'' the repeated testing,
urging the government to recall its ambassador to Paris.
     The party will appeal directly to the French people for support
to stop the testing through an advertisement it plans to run in a
French newspaper, party officials said.
     Meanwhile, a Hiroshima-based group of pacifist mayors around the
world sent a statement criticizing the test to Chirac and other
French leaders.
     The statement by the World Conference of Mayors for Peace
Through Inter-City Solidarity voiced ''strong disappointment'' and
lodged ''a strong protest.''
     In Tokyo, scores of protesters gathered in front of the French
Embassy in Tokyo, renewing their appeal for an immediate halt to
nuclear testing.

request of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser
Arafat, officials said Thursday.
     The delegation, which includes members from both houses of the
Diet, will leave Japan on Jan. 16 in time to visit polling stations
during the Jan. 20 election, the officials said.
     The election will establish a Palestinian council to act as
parliament under self-rule.
     Keizo Obuchi, former vice president of the Liberal Democratic
Party, will lead the delegation, the officials said.
     They said the delegation will meet Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres before returning to Tokyo on Jan. 23.

GSDF says 30 garrison towns could be streamlined+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) has drawn up a report,
saying about 30 of its 160 garrison towns nationwide could be
streamlined under Japan's new defense program, according to a copy
of the report made available Thursday.
     The streamlining will be possible because the number of GSDF
members will be reduced to 1,000 or fewer at some 100 garrison towns
under the proposed new defense program, the report says.
     The new defense program outline, which is to replace the current
Cold War-era version mapped out in 1976, is expected to set the
number of GSDF personnel at 145,000, down from the present 180,000.
     The new outline calls for cutting the number of GSDF divisions
to nine from the current 13.
     The GSDF will decide which garrison towns will be streamlined
within five years in the hope that the plan will be carried out in 10
years' time after making adjustments with the municipalities
concerned.
     The government is now working on details of the new defense
program outline so as to have it adopted in time for the start of
fiscal 1996 in April.

Hashimoto says he will push for LDP gov't+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Ryutaro Hashimoto said
Thursday he would fight the next general election with the aim of
achieving a majority of seats for the LDP.
     ''In the next election, we will give it all we've got to win the
people's support for an LDP government,'' Hashimoto said in a
prerecorded New Year program for Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK).
     Hashimoto, the international trade and industry minister, has
apparently articulated his ambition of winning a monopoly on power in
place of the current ruling coalition with the Social Democratic
Party (SDP) and New Party Sakigake, political analysts said.
     But Hashimoto's words are not viewed by LDP watchers as
signaling a new party policy of breaking up the tripartite alliance
any time soon.
     Hashimoto has only paid lip service to some combatant LDP
lawmakers who do not relish being in coalition with the socialists
and have made clear their desire for a monopoly on power, they said.
     Hashimoto also said in the NHK program that the House of
Representatives should not be dissolved for a snap election at least
until the budget for the next fiscal year passes the Diet.
     He added that a dissolution of the lower house is unlikely to
come until after a Group of Seven summit meeting in France at the
end of June.
     The LDP leader said Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected head of the
main opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), harbors some
ideas that are ''diametrically opposed'' to the LDP's policies.

Kuwaiti-Palestinian gains rare refugee status in Japan+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A Palestinian whose original application for refugee status in
Japan was turned down in 1992 on Thursday became the first and only
person among hundreds of such applicants to be granted the status on
appeal to the justice minister.
     Fawaz Housein El Hanafy, 29, of Ichikawa, Chiba Prefecture,
first applied for refugee status after arriving in Japan in November
1991.  The application was rejected in November 1992 and he appealed.
     Between 1982 and June this year, 357 people have used a system
which allows applicants to appeal directly to the minister if their
application is turned down.  Fawaz is the first whose appeal has been
accepted.
     Makoto Iwai, manager of the Japanese branch of the human rights
organization Amnesty International, told a press conference shared
with Fawaz in Tokyo that the case could signify a change in the
appeals system.
     ''I would like to see this case serve as the catalyst for a
change in the way Japan recognizes refugees,'' Iwai said.
     The ministry has not clarified its reasons for granting the
status to Fawaz.
     But supporters of Fawaz said it appeared the ministry had not
appreciated the need to grant him refugee status at the time of his
initial application because an Iranian interpreter used by the
ministry did not understand his Arabic.
     They said another possible reason for the decision to grant him
refugee status was Fawaz's statelessness which meant there would be
no diplomatic repercussions.
     Fawaz was born stateless in Kuwait to parents who left the Gaza
Strip after the foundation of Israel in 1948.
     After Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in 1990 and the Palestine
Liberation Organization threw its support behind Iraq, feeling
against Palestinians in Kuwait ran high and Fawaz said he was forced
to flee the country fearing the Kuwaiti government was about to
apprehend him.

U.S. forces to ease 'off-limits' for Okinawa servicemen+

NAHA, Japan, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The U.S. military informed the city of Okinawa on Thursday that
it will relax Saturday a ban on its personnel from entering busy
streets, a measure taken after the indictment of three of its
servicemen on charges of raping a local schoolgirl.
     ''Off-limits'' hours, which stretch from midnight to 6 a.m. at
present, will be shortened to between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m.
     Out of concern over the effect on local restaurants and other
entertainment businesses, however, city authorities are still
demanding the total lifting of the ban, which the U.S. forces imposed
Oct. 14
     It was the first ''off-limits'' measure taken by the U.S.
military in Japan since the southwesternmost Japanese prefecture was
returned to Tokyo in 1972 after 27 years of U.S. occupation.
     The measure was not welcomed by proprietors in the area whose
businesses depend largely on U.S. service personnel.
     Noting that about 10 restaurants and bars have already been
forced to close due to the measure, city officials think it is
unlikely that the partial relaxation will dramatically change the
situation.
     Japanese prosecutors have indicted three U.S. servicemen on
charges of abducting and raping an Okinawa schoolgirl in early
September.
     The case has caused anger among Japanese, especially in Okinawa
Prefecture where three quarters of U.S. military facilities in Japan
are concentrated in terms of land space.

Ozawa gets 3 ex-premiers to accept party jobs+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected president of the main
opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), said Thursday he
has secured commitments from three former prime ministers within
Shinshinto to accept senior party posts and support the party in the
next election.
     After successive talks with Tsutomu Hata, who lost the party's
presidential election to Ozawa, Toshiki Kaifu and Morihiro Hosokawa,
Ozawa said, ''I obtained agreements from the three'' to assuming
''significant party posts.''
     Ozawa, who was formally named president of Shinshinto at a
meeting of party Diet members earlier Thursday, underlined his
readiness to launch an all-out fight against the coalition government
of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.
     The hard-line new opposition leader also made no secret of his
intention of resorting to every possible means to force Murayama to
dissolve the House of Representatives for a snap general election.
     The 53-year-old Ozawa, previously the party's secretary general,
will serve a two-year term, replacing outgoing Shinshinto President
Kaifu, who did not seek reelection.
     Following the inauguration, Ozawa immediately started forming
the new party leadership, with the primary aim of restoring party
unity ahead of the next election.
     Ozawa told a press conference that he plans to create a new
advisory panel for the party chief to incorporate the views of the
three former prime ministers.
     Their presence in party machinery will help consolidate a united
front, he said.
     He also said at the press conference that Shinshinto has an
important ''mission'' in the face of many problems confronting Japan
both at home and abroad.
     ''I am not necessarily very confident that I can fulfill this
responsibility as party head, but I will do my best,'' he said.
     He called the Murayama government ''irresponsible'' for adopting
a controversial plan to use 685 billion yen of taxpayers' money to
liquidate seven moribund housing loan companies and reiterated his
intention of forcing him into an early election.
     Hardly had Ozawa begun attempting to heal the party rift when
rival Hata apparently moved to keep his distance from the chief.
     Hata's supporters set up a preparation committee for a new
policy study group, which a close Hata aide said is aimed at helping
young members to win elections but which could become a faction-like
grouping.
     The group will seek to make Shinshinto ''a fair and open party''
by incorporating opinions from rank-and-file members and discussing
Ozawa's policy proposals, according to the supporters.
     They said the study group will be established before a regular
Diet session starts in January.
     Meanwhile, Ozawa made the round of greetings with the leaders of
other parties.
     At the headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), to
which Ozawa once belonged, President Ryutaro Hashimoto, trade
minister, greeted Ozawa by saying, ''Welcome back and
congratulations.''
     ''It is really a long time (since I left the party),'' Ozawa
said, adding he felt as if he had come home.
     When Ozawa asked for Hashimoto's ''guidance,'' the LDP head
said, ''We both bear responsibility for the Japanese people and for
the world.  Let's put our shoulders to the wheels.''
     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, who heads the Social
Democratic Party, congratulated Ozawa on his ''overwhelming victory.''
     At the headquarters of New Party Sakigake headed by Finance
Minister Masayoshi Takemura, acting party chief Shusei Tanaka courted
Ozawa, saying the two parties may strike an alliance on some
important issues.
     Ozawa responded by saying, ''I have no intention of engaging in
mere Diet maneuverings.  We can work together on some high-level
problems.''

U.S. serviceman indicted for possession of rifle+

AOMORI, Japan, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A U.S. serviceman from Misawa base in northern Japan was
indicted Thursday for alleged possession of a rifle and bullets
without a permit.
     The serviceman, Airman 2nd Class John Turner, 25, was released
the same day on bail of 1 million yen after he was indicted by
prosecutors in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture.
     Prosecutors allege the rifle and 12 bullets were found in a car
Turner was driving Dec. 13.  Police arrested him that day.
     Police said Turner is also suspected of firing a hunting rifle
in a park in Misawa on Dec. 10 and that once sufficient evidence is
collected they could send papers to the prosecutors on the case early
next month alleging he fired the rifle in an area banned to hunting.
     They said Turner has already admitted to most of the details in
the prosecution case.
     Police said at the time that a park worker heard four gunshots
and immediately saw two foreigners in the park holding a rifle.
     The two men then left in a car with a U.S. forces number plate,
according to the worker.  Nobody was injured in the incident.

Japan's defense chief may visit Russia next year: Tass+

MOSCOW, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japanese Defense Agency chief Seishiro Eto may visit Moscow
next year for talks with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev for
the first-ever defense summit between the two countries, a senior
Russian official said Thursday.
     Russia is fully prepared to maintain contacts with Japan in the
military sphere at the highest possible level, Deputy Foreign
Minister Alexander Panov told Itar-Tass news agency.
     While the two countries agreed to make efforts to arrange Eto's
visit to Russia, an accord on the schedule has yet to be reached,
according to Japanese diplomatic sources.
     Tass quoted Panov as saying there can be no real change for the
better if there is no dialogue.

Japanese envoy protests at French nuclear test+

PARIS, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A senior Japanese diplomat protested Thursday against the
latest French nuclear test conducted in the South Pacific late
Wednesday.
      Charge d'Affaires to France Yutaka Iimura told a French Foreign
Ministry official in charge of Asian affairs that it is extremely
regrettable that France has conducted another nuclear test at Mururoa
Atoll, the fifth in the recent series, Japanese officials said.
     Pointing out that the United Nations passed a resolution in the
General Assembly on Dec. 12 calling for the immediate termination of
all nuclear tests, Iimura called on France to stop such tests.
     The French official only reiterated that Paris is ready to sign
a comprehensive test ban treaty soon after the current series of
tests is complete, the officials said.

U.S. plans int'l investment forum for ex-communist states+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The United States is likely to propose setting up a forum to
allow former Soviet Union and East European governments to exchange
information with companies in industrialized nations that are
interested in investing in the region, trade ministry officials said
Friday.
     The proposal will be made when trade ministers of the Group of
Seven (G-7) major industrialialized nations meet their counterparts
from Russia, Poland and 12 other ex-communist states in Baltimore,
Maryland, on Jan. 8-10 to discuss support for their economic reforms
efforts.
     The U.S. is sounding out other participating nations about the
forum, which could be a key issue at the meeting, the officials of the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.
     The East-West trade ministers' conference, which will also be
attended by business representatives, started in 1992 and the
upcoming session will be the fourth such meeting.
     At the meeting, the ministers will gauge achievements under last
year's Warsaw Declaration which calls for cumulative investment in
the former Soviet and East European states to hit 200 billion dollars
by the turn of the century, the officials said.
     The participants, meanwhile, will discuss the target countries'
tax systems relative to trade and investment as well as concrete
steps to improve business practices in the region, they added.
     Also on the agenda will be practical advice on accounting
procedures and market surveys for promoting privatization of
state-run enterprises and conversion of military contractors into
civilian corporations, according to the officials.
     The Japanese mission will consist of MITI Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto as well as executives from trading houses, banks and other
relevant companies, the officials said.
     After the trade gathering, Hashimoto will go to Washington and
stay there until Jan. 13 to meet ranking U.S. government officials
and Congressional leaders.  The trade ministry is also planning to
include a meeting with President Bill Clinton in his itinerary, they
said.

Ozawa names Yonezawa, Hata's aides for key party posts+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Ichiro Ozawa, newly-elected president of the main opposition
Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), on Friday named Takashi Yonezawa as
the party's secretary general and gave senior party posts to two
aides of his rival Tsutomu Hata, party officials said.
     In forming the new party leadership, Ozawa apparently placed
priority on healing the wounds left by the bitter battle with Hata in
the presidential election.
     Yonezawa was previously chairman of the now-defunct Democratic
Socialist Party, one of nine parties and groups that merged to form
Shinshinto in December last year.
     Ozawa named Hajime Funada, a close aide to Hata, as acting
chairman of the Political Activities Council under Kozo Watanabe, who
continues to head the key council.
     Another Hata follower, Kazuo Aichi, was appointed as chairman of
the Policy Research Council.
     Ozawa was formally named party president Thursday after
overwhelming his sole rival, former Prime Minister Hata, in the party
presidential race.
     The new party executive line-up was announced by the new
secretary general Yonezawa at a press conference in the Diet building.
     Shinshinto chief Ozawa also created a ''supreme advisory
council'' within the party and appointed to it as members three
former prime ministers -- Toshiki Kaifu, Morihiro Hosokawa and Hata.
     Ozawa himself also took the post of the chairman of the
''tomorrow cabinet.''
     New Secretary General Yonezawa said at a press conference that a
''well-balanced'' executive body has been formed.

MOF vice minister to quit over ministry scandals++

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Administrative Vice Finance Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa will
resign at the beginning of next year amid a storm of criticism of
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) following a series of financial
scandals, including the involvement of ministry officials in
improper activities.
     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura on Friday accepted
Shinozawa's offer of resignation.
     Shinozawa, who took the ministry's top administrative post last
May, offered to resign after the ministry presented its draft fiscal
1996 budget Dec. 20.
     Tadashi Ogawa, director general of the National Tax
Administration Agency, will succeed Shinozawa as vice finance
minister.
     Shinozawa's resignation and the appointment of his successor
will be formally approved at a cabinet meeting Jan. 5.
     At a hastily arranged press conference, Takemura said, ''I have
accepted Shinozawa's resignation to improve the morale of the
ministry, which is under an oppressive atmosphere following scandals
involving ministry officials.''
     ''Shinozawa is not quitting to take the blame for any individual
incident, such as the failure of two Tokyo credit unions or the
ministry's decision to use taxpayers' money for the liquidation of
ailing housing loan companies,'' he said.
     In talks with reporters after the press conference, Shinozawa
said, ''I have decided to step down to let some fresh air into the
ministry from the start of the New Year.''
     Shinozawa said he is not resigning to take responsibility for
the ministry's response to any individual incident.
     The ministry has been under fierce criticism at home and abroad
for its lack of transparency in dealing with a series of incidents
that have hit the financial industry, including the bad loan issue at
housing loan companies and a huge loss cover-up at Daiwa Bank's New
York branch.
     Domestic criticism is focused on a series of scandals involving
ministry officials.
     So far this year, two senior ministry officials, including
Yoshio Nakajima, head of the Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy,
a Finance Ministry affiliate, have quit after they were found to have
had cozy relations with people linked to the two failed Tokyo credit
unions involved in illicit loan scandals.
     Shinozawa said he had pondered whether he should resign at a
time when the ministry was about to proceed with a liquidation scheme
recently mapped out for struggling housing loan companies.
     But he thought it necessary for him, as the top-ranking
bureaucrat, to take action after a year which saw so many incidents
take place, Shinozawa said.
     At the news conference, Takemura said he currently has no
intention to resign to take the blame for the series of financial
scandals.
     ''It is my responsibility to flesh out the liquidation scheme
for ailing housing loan companies,'' he said.
     Since Takemura became finance minister in June 1994, Shinozawa
is the second vice finance minister to resign before the expiry of
his term of office.
     Shinozawa's predecessor, Jiro Saito, resigned in May under
strong pressure from the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest of the
three coalition parties, for his strong ties with key opposition
leader Ichiro Ozawa and their joint campaign to legislate a
''national welfare tax'' that he and Ozawa reportedly devised to
replace the 3% comsumption tax.
     Takemura told the news conference Friday he has selected Ogawa
as Shinozawa's successor and added Ogawa will be replaced at the
National Tax Administration Agency by Sohei Hidaka, director general
of the ministry's Securities Bureau.

Upper house VP agrees to pay debts with expense money+

AOMORI, Japan, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     House of Councillors Vice President Kanpei Matsuo has reached
an agreement with a credit union to pay back some 700 million yen in
loans using part of his public expense account, informed sources
said Friday.
     Matsuo has promised the credit union in Aomori Prefecture that
he will use part of the 29 million yen annual expense allotment for
the vice presidential post to pay back loans owed by himself and
related companies.
     Matsuo has been in arrears on the loans, with principal now
totaling 700 million yen.  Some of the loans date back 20 years.
     Matsuo said his own loans amount to only about 40 million yen,
adding that the rest is owed by those for whom he has given
guarantees.
     ''There is no legal problem to the arrangement,'' he said.

LOBBYING ORGANIZATIONS PUT UNDER FEBRUARY 14
DEADLINE TO COMPLY WITH NEW REGISTRATION LAW

     Lobbying organizations are under a February 14 deadline to
identify their lobbyists and disclose their legislative or
regulatory interests under a new law which took effect January 1.
     Also, lobbyists who were active during the fourth quarter of
1995 are required to file activity reports, even though the law
requiring them has been repealed.
     The 1946 Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act was repealed on
January 1. Thus, its repeal didn't affect the quarterly activity
report for the period that ended on December 31.
     In a joint statement published in the December 22 edition of
the Congressional Record, Secretary of the Senate Kelly D.
Johnston and Clerk of the House Robin H. Carle said all lobbying
organizations must register under the new law.
     While individuals and lobbying organizations that were
registered under the old law must file a final quarterly activity
report, registrations under the old law are no longer valid.
That's because the new law's disclosure requirements are
different from those contained in the old law. Moreover, the new
law shifts the registration and reporting requirement to lobbying
firms and lobbying organizations.
     "All lobbyists active after January 1, 1996, must register
under the new Lobbying Disclosure Act," Johnston and Carle said.
The February 14 registration deadline, they added, applies "to a
lobbyist who has a retainer agreement with a client in effect on
January 1, 1996."
     A new registration form was to have been released on January
12. But, due to the snow blizzards that hit Washington in recent
days, the Government Printing Office was unable to meet the
delivery date. Forms will be made available later this month at
the House Legislative Resource Center, 1036 Longworth House
Office Building (202/225-1300), and the Senate Office of Public
Records, 232 Hart Senate Office Building (202/224-0758).

AN UNRULY LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE ITS OWN RULES,
APPEALS COURT SAYS RHODE ISLAND HOUSE CAN BAN LOBBYISTS

By Edward Zuckerman, Editor & Publisher

     Boston--Rhode Island might have an unruly legislature, but
it at least has the right to set its rules. So, the U.S. 1st
Circuit Court of Appeals held in a recent divided opinion, a 1993
rule that banishes lobbyists from their traditional roosting
place around the floor of the Rhode Island House of
Representatives is valid, no matter what other constitutional
issues it might provoke.
     The 2-1 opinion handed down in late November by a
three-judge appeals court panel overturned an earlier decision by
U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Pettine. He held the rule had to
be set aside because it didn't apply equally to all lobbyists.
While private sector lobbyists were affected, lobbyists from the
state's own agencies retained their access to the House floor.
     Instead of relaxing the rule, the Rhode Island Legislature
reacted to Judge Pettine's decision by extending it to the state
government's lobbyists, too. The legislature's action served only
to harden efforts by a coalition of lobbying organizations to
have the rule declared unconstitutional.
     Inexplicably, Judge Pettine wasn't asked to consider whether
the Rhode Island legislature was entitled to immunity from
judicial intervention. There is a time-honored doctrine, derived
from the Constitution's "speech and debate" clause, which allows
legislatures to conduct their affairs without judicial scrutiny.
     "Parties must speak clearly in the trial court on pain that,
if they forget their lines, they will likely be bound forever to
hold their peace," Circuit Judge Bruce M. Selya noted in the
opinion he wrote for himself and Circuit Judge Conrad K. Cyr.
     But "foolish consistency is reputedly the hobgoblin of
little minds," Judge Selya continued, drawing upon the widsom of
Ralph Waldo Emerson to explain why he and Judge Cyr were making
an exception.
     "In our republican system, different institutions of
government occupy different spheres. Within its own domain, the
legislative branch of a state government is entitled to a
reasonable measure of independence in conducting its internal
affairs," they said.
     And they concluded: "As a rule, a legislature's regulation
of the atmosphere in which it conducts its core legislative
activities--debating, voting, passing legislation and the
like--is part and parcel of the legislative process and, hence,
not subject to a judicial veto."
     Failing to raise a "legislative immunity" defense, the two
circuit judges said, "had the regrettable effect of blindsiding
the district judge and prolonging the litigation."
     Circuit Judge Sandra Lynch, the panel's dissenting member,
felt the Rhode Island House wasn't entitled to immunity and that
its rule did extinguish a First Amendment right.
     "When the government chooses to listen only to its own voice
in the political process by excluding the voices of private
citizens, core First Amendment values are violated.
     "The First Amendment does not permit the government to put
its thumb on the scale in this way and favor itself in the arena
of political speech," she said.

     Connecticut journalist Charles Dudley Warner's century-old
aphorism that "politics makes strange bedfellows" remains true,
Judge Selya said of the "improbable alliance" that banded
together--social workers, school teachers, gun ownership
advocates, pro-life and pro-choice activists and the American
Civil Liberties Union--to protest the Rhode Island House's rule.
     To understand why such a disparate group of organizations
found fellowship, one merely must know that the Rhode Island
House of Representatives is a part-time legislature that meets a
few afternoons and evenings. Its members have their own full-time
jobs. They have no offices, no staff aides, just a chair and a
desk on the House floor. Sometimes, during long legislative
sessions, amendments are offered and approved in the same day.
     There is a gallery overlooking the floor, but there is also
an aisle with a few dozen chairs around the floor's perimeter
which have been occupied for many years by lobbyists. When the
House convened under new leadership in 1993, a rule was approved
that unceremoniously dispatched the private sector lobbyists, who
must be registered and wear identifying badges, to the gallery.
House Rule 45, besides leaving the state government's lobbyists
unaffected, also allowed floor access to the general public.
     House Rule 45 creates a hardship for lobbyists, particularly
when it prevents them from communicating their views on
amendments which are proposed and voted on in the same
proceeding, the trial court acknowledged. Even so, the circuit
court decided, "we think it is beyond serious dispute that
enforcing a duly enacted legislative rule which prohibits
lobbying on the House floor during House sessions is well within
the legislative sphere."
     Judge Lynch, in a dissent which gave First Amendment
concerns priority over a legislature's immunity to judicial veto,
cited several examples where the rule's enforcement gave the
state's lobbyists an unfair advantage.
     For example, when the House took up bills relating to public
funding of abortion, reinstatement of the death penalty and cuts
in public welfare spending, lobbyists from the Rhode Island Right
to Life Committee, the American Civil Liberties Union and the
National Association of Social Workers could only "wave from the
balcony" while the governor, attorney general and state welfare
department officials promoted their views directly to lawmakers.
     "Prison-related bills received the same treatment," Judge
Lynch said. "Department of Corrections officials were on the
floor with legislators during debate while ACLU lobbyists who
opposed the Department's position watched ineffectively from the
balcony. There were numerous other instances where the Governor's
Office, the State Police, the Department of Economic Development,
the Banking and Insurance Department, the Fire Marshal, the
General Treasurer's Office and the Department of Business
Regulation lobbyists spoke directly with legislators on the floor
regarding pending legislation."
     Even if legislative immunity had been raised earlier, Judge
Lynch said it wouldn't have foreclosed "a judicial determination
of the constitutionality of the defendant's practices."
     "The legislative immunity doctrine is not meant for the
protection of the legislators for their own benefit, 'but to
support the rights of the people, by enabling their
representatives to execute the functions of their office without
fear of prosecution, civil or criminal,'" she said, quoting from
a 1972 Supreme Court decision in a bribery case that involved
former Maryland Democratic Sen. Daniel Brewster.
     Lobbying is a form of political speech that deserves First
Amendment protection, Judge Lynch said.
     "The dangers...are plain. By simply excluding all voices
save the voices of government lobbyists, the government could
easily 'suppress support for a minority party or an unpopular
cause, or...exclude the expression of certain ideas from the
marketplace of ideas.' These effects are 'so plainly illegitimate
that they would immediately invalidate the rule,'" she said,
quoting from a 1984 Supreme Court decision.
     And, quoting a more recent Supreme Court decision, she said
the Rhode Island House "has no authority to license one side of
the debate to fight freestyle, while requiring the others to
follow Marquis of Queensbury Rules."
     "The point is that the government has permitted itself to
speak while prohibiting non-government speech. Speech from
non-government speakers, including lobbyists, is also valuable.
Indeed, while lobbying may be subject to registration and
disclosure, no case has ever suggested that lobbying, including
its information-gathering and providing component, could be
banned entirely," Judge Lynch said.
     And she added elsewhere in her dissenting opinion:
     "There is another danger, and that is that the government's
voice will not truly represent the interests of the public.
Government should theoretically represent the people and not
represent itself. Theory and reality often depart. The government
is not always a mirror of the people. Government employees today
are recognized as constituting their own interest group," Judge
Lynch warned.

COLORADO REPUBLICAN PARTY SPENDING CASE
IS NOW GOING TO U.S. SUPREME COURT

     The U.S. Supreme Court said it will review a 10-year-old
legal dispute involving political expenditures by the Colorado
Republican party.
     The case is being watched closely by Democrats and
Republicans. If a decision reached last summer by the U.S. 10th
Circuit Court of Appeals is overturned by the high court, then
the Federal Election Campaign Act's restrictions on political
party expenditures might become unraveled by enabling them to
make unlimited expenditures to elect or defeat federal candidates
without counting against contribution or expenditure limits which
otherwise apply to them.
     At issue in the case is a $15,000 payment by the Colorado
GOP for radio commercials that aired in 1986, fully eight months
before the general election and before the party selected its
candidate to oppose incumbent Sen. Timothy Wirth's (D-Colo.)
re-election. It described it as an "operating expense" in its
financial disclosure to the Federal Election Commission which
opened an investigation after a formal complaint was filed by the
Colorado Democratic party.
     The FEC filed a civil suit in Denver when the Colorado
Republican party refused to admit it violated federal law in a
conciliation agreement. But the FEC's effort to press the case
was dealt a setback when U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham
ruled the GOP expenditure wasn't subject to government regulation
because the commercials didn't contain an "express advocacy"
message.
     Nottingham cited election law cases dating back to the 1976
Buckley vs. Valeo decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court has
held that political expenditures are immune from government
regulation if they do not convey "express advocacy"--that is,
they don't expressly advocate the election or defeat of a federal
candidate with explicit words such as "vote for" or "vote
against."
     Last summer, though, a three-judge appeals court panel in
Denver held that the "express advocacy" standard applies to
independent expenditure activities. Because political parties
cannot engage in independent expenditure activity, the Colorado
GOP expenditures can only be treated as "coordinated
expenditures" which are subject to the FECA's requirements if
they are made "in connection with a federal election."
     "Any reasonable reading of the commercial would leave the
reader (or listener) with the impression that the Republican
party sought to 'diminish' public support for Wirth and 'garner
support' for the unnamed Republican nominee. The commercial
unquestionably contained an electioneering message.
     "We conclude that the anti-Wirth publicity was an
'expenditure in connection with' the 1986 Colorado senatorial
election because it named both a clearly identifiable candidate
and contained an electioneering message," the appeals court said.
     In its order, the three-judge panel ordered the case back to
the trial court with instructions to enter a finding in the FEC's
favor.
     Instead, the Colorado GOP sought an en banc review by the
U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. When its petition for review
was rejected by the appeals court, the state party applied for
review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
     In its petition to the high court, the state party argued
that the election law violates its First Amendment right of free
speech. But the U.S. Justice Department, in an opposition brief,
said the appeals court decision complied with Supreme Court
precedent.

CONGRESS PAVES THE WAY FOR ELECTRONIC
FILINGS TO FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

     Congress completed action late last month on legislation
that will speed disclosure and pave the way toward electronic
submission of campaign finance reports.
     Effective immediately, the legislation eliminates the Clerk
of the House as the official filing point-of-entry for House
candidates. Instead, congressional candidates will file their
reports directly to the Federal Election Commission, thus
eliminating a two-day period for delivering copies of reports to
the FEC.
     The legislation does not affect senatorial candidates who
will continue filing their campaign disclosure reports to the
Secretary of the Senate.
     Also, beginning next year, the FEC will be allowed to accept
campaign disclosure reports without requiring a treasurer's legal
signature. By permitting other means for meeting the law's
signature requirement, the FEC will be enabled to accept
electronic submissions.
     Finally, the new law, when signed by President Clinton, will
waive a provision of present election law which requires
candidates, PACs and political parties to make duplicate filings
of their reports in states where computer terminals provide
access to the FEC public records.

MICHIGAN POLITICAL DONORS CAN BE
SOLICITED BY OTHER CANDIDATES

     Lansing, Mich.--Individuals whose gifts to state and local
candidates are publicly disclosed are fair game to other
candidates, Michigan Secretary of State Candice S. Miller said in
an interpretive ruling.
     The state's election law prohibits the use of contributor
information for "commercial" solicitation. But, unlike federal
law, the prohibition doesn't specifically cover "political"
solicitation.
     Miller noted that the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, in
a case involving use of federally disclosed contributor
information, ruled that the publication and sale of contributor
information by Political Contributions Data Inc. did not by
itself constitute a prohibited commercial use.
     Thus, Miller said, Aristotle Industries, the
Washington-based company which requested the ruling, can compile
and sell information about contributors to Michigan
officeseekers.
     "The interpretation of the term 'commercial purposes'
adopted by the 2nd Circuit espouses a rationale that applies
equally well to that same term, as used in the Michigan Campaign
Finance Act. The difference between Michigan's prohibition under
the Michigan Campaign Finance Act and the federal prohibition
under the Federal Election Campaign Act is that the federal
prohibition applies to 'all kinds of solicitations,' whereas the
prohibition of the MCFA applies only to commercial
solicitations," Miller said in her ruling.

DOLE, CLINTON LEAD PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES
IN PRIMARY MATCHING FUND CERTIFICATIONS

     While large portions of the federal government remained
closed, two agencies close to the hearts of most presidential
candidates--the Federal Election Commission and the U.S. Treasury
Department--were open for business.
     As the 1995 calendar year came to an end, the FEC certified
$37.4 million worth of matching fund payments to 10 eligible
presidential candidates.
     They will receive 60% of the certified amount from Treasury,
due to a shortfall in the primary matching fund account, with the
rest to be paid later in the year when taxpayers begin filing
their 1995 federal income taxes.
     Republican hopeful Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) led all recipients
with a $5.6 million payment from Treasury. President Bill
Clinton, facing no serious opposition for the Democratic party
nomination, drew $5.4 million.
     Also on the recipients' list were perennial Democratic
candidate Lyndon LaRouche who received $156,740 and Natural Law
Party candidate John Hagelin who received $60,000.
     Under presidential fund rules, candidates lose their
eligibility 30 days after failing to receive at least 10% of the
vote in two successive primaries.
     Last week, LaRouche appeared to gain a few extra days of
eligibility by becoming the lone Democratic candidate in the
February 24 Delaware primary. President Clinton said he wouldn't
enter the Delaware contest after New Hampshire officials
complained that Delaware scheduled its election only four days
after their state's first-in-the-nation presidential primary.
     Delaware Democrats said last week they would draft
85-year-old former Gov. Elbert Carvel as a "favorite son" to
prevent LaRouche from gaining delegates to the party's
presidential nominating convention.

BOND DEALER ASKS U.S. SUPREME COURT
TO REVIEW CONSTITUTIONALITY OF RULE G-37

     Alabama bond dealer William Blount celebrated the New Year
by asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review lower court decisions
that have upheld the constitutionality of a government regulation
that restricts political contributions by municipal bond firms
and their employees.
     The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's Rule G-37
"places unprecedented restrictions on the First Amendment rights
of securities professionals and the Tenth Amendment rights of the
states," Blount claimed in a 21-page brief that was filed with
the high court on January 2.
     Under Rule G-37, which took effect in 1994 with U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission approval, a bond firm cannot
do business with a state or local bond issuing agency for two
years after the firm or an employee makes a contribution to the
campaign of a candidate or official who can influence the
agency's decisions.
     The rule hit particularly hard against Blount because he was
chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party when it took effect.
Because he was expected to help candidates raise money for their
campaigns, Blount won a temporary order that suspended the rule's
application to him.
     Rule G-37, Blount charged in his petition, "does violence to
constitutional principles" and usurps the power of states to
enact their own campaign finance laws.
     Blount went to the Supreme Court after the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said it wouldn't
review a three-judge panel's conclusion that the MSRB rule was
constitutional.
     The appeals court upheld the rule, even in the absence of
evidence of so-called "pay-to-play" practices which the MSRB said
its rule was designed to prevent.
     "No smoking gun is needed where, as here, the conflict of
interest is apparent, the likelihood of stealth is great and the
legislative purpose is prophylactic," the appeals court said.

REFORMERS CRITICIZE USE OF STATE-OWNED
BUILDINGS FOR POLITICAL FUNDRAISING EVENTS

     Albany, N.Y.--Reform advocates think its "outrageous" for
New York state lawmakers to hold campaign fundraising events in
restaurants which are located in the state-owned Empire State
Plaza which has underground passageways to the state capitol and
its office buildings.
     Representatives of four organizations--New York Common
Cause, New York Public Interest Research Group, the League of
Women Voters and United We Stand America--criticized the practice
at a late December press conference.
     They said there was nothing illegal about holding campaign
fundraising events in the privately-owned, rent-paying
businesses. But they also said it was unethical to raise campaign
funds on state-owned property.

New problem for Mrs. Waldholtz

     Fees paid to a private detective who worked for Rep. Enid
Greene Waldholtz's (R-Utah) 1994 campaign do not appear in
campaign finance disclosure reports to the Federal Election
Commission, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.
     Malcolm Shannon, a private investigator, told the newspaper
he only provided personal security consulting services to Mrs.
Waldholtz. But sources in Waldholtz's campaign claimed Shannon
checked the backgrounds of people who were contributing to the
campaigns of her opponents, Democratic incumbent Karen Shepherd
and independent Merrill Cook.
     The newspaper said the Utah Democratic Party filed a formal
complaint to the Federal Election Commission last October,
alleging the Waldholtz's campaign violated the federal election
law by failing to disclose the fees paid to Shannon.

Eating words

     "PACs just try to buy influence and buy incumbents...(I
don't) accept PAC money and I'd like to see an end to this type
of money-funneling." That was Massachusetts Republican Gov.
William Weld speaking to the Boston Ad Club a few years ago.
     Last month, Weld said he would raise PAC funds for his
campaign against Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).
     Kerry doesn't accept PAC contributions but, the Boston Globe
noted, Kerry raised PAC funds while he chaired the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Disclosure compliance

     Baltimore City Council members Agnes Welch and Martin
O'Malley filed tardy campaign finance disclosure reports and paid
fines for missing the deadlines just in time for their December 7
inaugurations, the Baltimore Sun reported.
     Under Maryland law, elected state and local officials cannot
be sworn into office without certification by the State
Administrative Board of Election Laws that all disclosure reports
have been filed and all fines have been paid.

Wooing Catholics

     Christian Coalition, which mixes anti-abortion politics with
conservative social and welfare issues, has created a subsidiary
called the Catholic Alliance to increase its membership in
Massachusetts where voters tend to be Catholic, Democratic and
liberal.
     The Virginia-based political organization claims that
250,000 of its 1.7 million members are Catholic, even though the
church doesn't support its views on such issues as gun control,
immigration, welfare reform and budget cuts. Church officials
have remained neutral, allowing the Catholic Alliance to buy a
full-page ad in the Boston archdiocese newspaper to promote
attendance at a membership recruitment event.
     Catholic Alliance, described as a "wholly-owned subsidiary"
by Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed, will lure Catholics
into membership by focusing entirely on abortion and school
prayer.

Spinning out of control

     "Hopefully, they learned a lesson: not all politicians are
bad," State Rep. Alex Diaz de la Portilla said after fined $500
by the Florida Elections Commission for filing a false campaign
finance disclosure report.
     "We feel totally vindicated. They threw out five charges. To
not embarrass the elections department, they decided to find him
guilty of something," Portilla's brother and lawyer, Miguel Diaz
de la Portilla, told the Miami Herald.

Letter of the law

     Alaska Democratic Gov. Tony Knowles has come under fire for
refusing to disclose an estimated $300,000 worth of contributions
collected by his Governor's Fund at two fundraising events prior
to the February 15 disclosure deadline. Besides waiting for the
last minute, the gifts are expected to be treated as Alaska
Democratic Party receipts.
     "The governor's decision to delay disclosure, while within
the letter of the law, violates the spirit of the law. So does
his decision to report the fundraiser in the Democratic Party's
1995 report, which will not break out the information in a
quickly accessible separate report," the Anchorage Daily News
editorialized.
     "State disclosure statutes were designed so Alaskans would
know who contributed to elected officials and candidates...(T)he
law says the contributions must be reported by Feb. 15, not on
Feb. 15," the newspaper said.

Doctors' bill

     The Massachusetts Medical Society was fined $45,000 by the
state's ethics commission for providing at least $15,000 worth of
illegal gratuities to state lawmakers between 1989 and 1993. As
part of its settlement, the 214-year-old society which represents
15,000 physicians and medical students, admitted that its
lobbyist, Andrew Hunt, made gifts to lawmakers to ensure friendly
treatment of health-related legislation.
     Hunt, according to the Boston Globe, hosted key lawmakers on
a 1992 fishing trip to Puerto Rico and a 1993 golf trip to
Florida. Hunt submitted expense accounts to the society which
described the purpose of his expenditures as "medical
malpractice" or "Medicare" without identifying those who were
entertained.

UNITED STATES:  AT&T, MCI MOVE INTO DBS

With 1996 only a few weeks old and Congress poised to vote on a major
telecom deregulation bill, the two largest US long-distance telephone
companies have signalled that direct-to-home satellite broadcasts will
be a major strategic focus of their effort to build direct links to
American consumers.  Mitch Shapiro reports.

The long-distance/DBS alliance-making began on 22 January, when AT&T
announced an agreement to market and distribute Hughes' DirecTv DBS
service and the associated reception gear.

A few days later, MCI Communications, the number-two long distance
company, submitted the winning bid in a government auction of DBS
orbital slots that had been reclaimed from a company the government had
decided had waited too long to launch its DBS service.

As part of its deal with Hughes, AT&T is acquiring 2.5 percent of
DirecTv for $137.5 million.  The agreement also gives AT&T options to
increase its stake up to 30% over five years, depending mainly on how
many new DirecTv subscribers it enrolls over specific time periods.

AT&T, which is in the process of spinning off its telecom equipment and
computer divisions, is expected to begin marketing DirecTv service to
its long-distance and credit card customers by this summer.  According
to Joseph P.  Nacchio, executive vice president of AT&T's consumer and
small-business division, the DirecTv investment "in one fell
swoop,..establishes AT&T with a national presence in entertainment."

Though AT&T customers will not get a price break on DBS service, AT&T
hopes to lower the upfront DBS cost hurdle by offering financing
through its AT&T Universal Card.  AT&T customers, which will order
service and equipment directly from AT&T, will also receive a single
bill that will include both DBS and long-distance phone charges.

MCI's winning auction bid of $682.5 million topped competing bids by
Tele-Communications, Inc., the nation's largest cable TV operator, and
Echostar Communications, a smaller company which recently launched its
first DBS satellite on a Chinese-built rocket.

Not surprisingly, the long-distance company is teaming with Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp.  in the DBS arena.  It earlier had agreed to
invest $2 billion in News Corp.

In the wake of the auction, the two companies announced plans to create
a jointly owned company that will offer information and entertainment
services to both consumers and businesses.

The moves into DBS by AT&T and MCI follow several years during which
the two companies considered possible alliances with cable or local
phone companies.  No agreements ever resulted from these discussions
and Sprint, their chief long distance rival, eventually formed a joint
venture with three of the nation's largest cable operators, TCI,
Comcast and Cox.

The AT&T investment in DirecTv was generally welcomed by financial
analysts as a means to gain quick access to an established direct-to-
home broadband delivery system.  In contrast, there was considerable
skepticism regarding the potential payback on an MCI-backed DBS
venture.

In addition to the nearly $700 million it spent on spectrum, MCI will
need to spend as much as one billion dollars to build and launch its
satellites.  It will also come late to the market, lagging DirecTv and
Primestar by at least a few years, and Echostar and Alphastar - a soon-
to-be launched medium-power DBS service - by more than a year.

While some analysts believe the AT&T investment will help DirecTv
attract large numbers of cable customers - something that has yet to
occur despite rapid early sales of DBS receivers - others remain
skeptical, citing the still-high cost of DBS equipment, especially for
homes that want to receive DBS signals on multiple TV sets.

These analysts believe that while DBS may pose a serious threat to
weaker cable operators in smaller rural markets that are slow to
upgrade their networks, satellite technology is not likely to reach
double digit penetration levels in large metro markets, where cable and
telephone companies are expected to focus their network upgrade
investments.

ITALY:  STREAM LAUNCHES VOD GUIDE

"This monthly was conceived for the protagonists of a Great Adventure,
that of VideoMagic.  A unique service, a breakthrough in television
[...] For the first time in Italy, the television set loses its
traditional function as an electrical household appliance and becomes
an interactive tool." These lines introduce what is probably the
world's first VOD programme guide.

This slick, 80-page colour magazine is produced by Stream, the
subsidiary of Italian telecommunications operator STET in charge of
developing and distributing VideoMagic, the bouquet of on-demand
multimedia services delivered via the fast-expanding optical fibre
broadband switched network Italy is building.

Similar to a regular TV guide, the giornale della TV interattiva
introduces the customer to the various programmes and services.

With VideoMagic, Stream enters into the pre-commercial phase of the
service.  The magazine is distributed to the first 1,000 households
connected to the VOD service in Milan and Rome who are invited to test
the variety of products on offer, respond to questionnaires and whose
network utilisation will be monitored.  "It is the beginning, a dress
rehearsal," says Stream.  The information gathered will be used to
improve all aspects of the service, especially the navigation through
the various rubrics."

Presently, the VOD service is structured around a menu composed of four
service categories: Entertainment (Films, Your Television, Sports,
Music & Art); Children (Children's TV, How & Why, Cartoon & Telefilm),
Exploring; Shopping (Department Stores, Catalogue & Famous Brands,
Bargain Corner, Yellow Pages Rome/Milan) and At Your Service (Health &
Leisure, Citizens' Bureau, Kiosk, Financial/ Insurance Services).

Each service/title description is followed by a code, the length in
minutes and the session price.

The VideoMagic programme guide's index includes 65 movies and 70
Telefilms and series, out of a total of 230 programme entries
(excluding the numerous episodes of many TV series) - altogether 30,000
minutes of material.

GERMANY:  BERLIN DIGITAL CABLE TV

The first large digital cable TV project in Germany will start in
April, according to head of the Berlin media authority MABB, Hans Hege.
 The real start will not be until this autumn, however, as there will
not be enough digital settop boxes in the market, he revealed.

MABB reached a preliminary decision last November to give a digital
cable licence to telecom company Vebacom, together with local partner
EMG.  Vebacom, now a shareholder in the new digital TV alliance MMBG,
is talking to content providers, Deutsche Telekom and other cable
operators of the "Netzebene 4" in Berlin.

Hege is confident that the partnership of Vebacom and EMG will work.
"Pay-TV channel Premiere has got a lot of subscribers, for example,
while Vebacom has got a lot of know-how in subscriber management and
marketing and the EMG in digital technical operations, so these
companies could work together without there being any doubts of
gatekeeping.  Step by step the Berlin project will expand.  At first,
only a few Berlin cable households will receive the digital TV
programmes, but the number of cable households which can see the
hyperband-channels will increase in a short time to 10% (110,000)."

Fifteen hyperband channels and one normal-band channel will form the
heart of the new digital Berlin, while in other parts of Germany only
five hyperband channels are ready for digital broadcasting by Deutsche
Telekom.  Each of these channels can broadcast between six to ten TV
programmes.  "We need 35 digital cable channels, but 16 might be a good
start," Hege stated.

"We don't think that video-on-demand is possible yet for a mass cable
audience.  The bad experiences in Orlando have underlined this.
Bundling of channels, multiplexing and pay-perview are the future.  We
will establish the first real digital brand in Germany and, I hope,
that each of the German states will version our digital TV system on
their own cable systems."

On the technical side, the launch of digital TV in Berlin will be much
easier than in other states, because Berlin only has one central cable-
head station.  "Having only one cable-head station makes the digital TV
business in Berlin faster," Hege added.  Manfred Meier, network
developer for many foreign TV stations, also welcomed Hege's
initiative.  "We are having problems getting our foreign channels on to
German cable.  Digital TV in Berlin will be the first step in the right
direction to give more channels a chance to broadcast in Germany."

But Hege has not been not greeted with positive response everywhere.
The broadcasting organisation VPRT, the private cable operators of ANGA
and the biggest telecommunication rival Deutsche Telekom threaten to
sue the coming licensing decision of the MABB, if Vebacom gets an
exclusive digital cable licence in Berlin.  Said Hege, "It is
ridiculous that they are threatening to sue against our decision,
especially since Vebacom is still a member of two of these
organisations.  We don't want to create a monopoly, we want competition
in Berlin.  Each content provider can choose to distribute their
channels for themselves or to work with the service provider."

JAPAN:  NEW DIGITAL SYSTEM DEVELOPED

Researchers for Nippon Television Network, Matsushita Electric and six
other Japanese companies have developed a digital transmission system
that offers high definition resolution and multimedia applications.
Called Prog-ressive Digital Broadcasting, or 525P, the new system sends
and receives images via communications satellite at a rate of 60 frames
per second, twice the speed of conventional systems.  Like the current
NTSC system, the 525P uses 525 scanning lines, but the faster
transmission rate means that twice as much visual information appears
on the screen.  The resulting picture quality is equivalent to that
produced by NHK's Hi-Vision analogue system.  Also, like Hi-Vision, the
525P offers a 16:9 aspect ratio.

The partners on the NTV and Matsushita-led development team, which
include Texas Instruments, Toshiba, Japan Satellite System, DMC,
Hitachi and Sanyo, have successfully tested the system in transmissions
from Yokohama to receiving stations in Osaka and Tokyo, via the JCSAT-3
digital satellite.  The system was able to send from three to six
digital video channels using a single transponder.

The system's real-time progressive video decoder decodes compressed
signals at 60 frames a second, twice the speed of the MPEG-2's Main
Profile, Mail Level (MP@ML).  The system's settop box is installed with
a progressive digital decoder that can compress both digital, audio and
video signals simultaneously and offers a component output function
(Y,Pb,Pr) with a vertical scanning frequency of 31.5kHz.  Users of Wide
Clearvision or Hi-Vision sets are able to receive the system's digital
signals.

In addition to home receiving sets that include a parabola antenna and
a real-time progressive digital decoder or digital-decoder-installed
settop box, the system can transmit to PC monitors, opening the
possibility of multimedia services that allow users to receive and
process images and data on their PCs.

The 525P system is expected to play an important role in the ongoing
battle over Japan's transition to digital broadcasting.  NHK, which
spent more than two decades developing its Hi-Vision system, has long
advocated its use aboard the next-generation BS-4b broadcasting
satellite, which is scheduled for launch in 1997.  Given the planned
switch to digital by cable and communications satellite broadcasters,
beginning in the fall of this year with the start of DMC 50-channel
digital service, top officials in the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications have been advocating the rapid introduction of a
digital system to BS broadcasting as well.

In May an MPT advisory panel will issue a report recommending whether
the broadcasting system for the BS-4b satellite be analogue or digital.
 With the announcement of the new NTV digital system (see news story),
the balance has been further weighted against NHK's Hi-Vision analogue
alternative.

EUROPE:  EC AIDS NEW 16:9 BROADCASTERS

Under its Action Plan for the Introduction of Advanced TV Services in
Europe, the European Commission has granted ECU4.395 million ($5.520
million) to seven more television stations in five countries to support
a total of 2,000 hours of wide-screen programme transmissions.

The decision will enable Austria's public broadcaster ORF, Denmark's
Danmarks Radio, the Italian regional stations Telenuovo, Synthesia and
Videolina as well as Veronica from the Netherlands and Granada in the
UK to present wide-screen TV to their viewers for the first time.
Moreover, the Danish service will be the first wide-screen service to
start using the digital satellite TV standard developed by the European
Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) Group.

"The announcement of a digital wide-screen service by Danmarks Radio is
of strategic importance because it shows that 16:9 really has the
potential to become the screen format of the Information Society,"
commented Martin Bangemann, European Commissioner in charge of
Industry, Information Technologies and Telecommunications, "Wide-screen
is a bridge between analogue and digital television for the consumer.
It works with either technology and therefore futureproofs consumer
investments in the most expensive part of the TV system, the screen
itself."

The overall objective of the Action Plan is to accelerate consumer
uptake of wide-screen TV by overcoming the "chicken and egg" problem:
broadcasters would not transmit 16:9 without TV sets while
manufacturers would not produce them without broadcasting.
Broadcasters in countries with no wide-screen services until now
qualify for funding up to 80% of their expenses, in other countries up
to 50% (see table on back page).

With the latest additions, it is no less than 41 broadcasters in 13
European countries who have received Action Plan support committing
them to transmit true 16:9 pictures - not letterbox.

If Danmarks Radio may well become the first broadcaster to offer
widescreen digitally via satellite, it is not the sole operator
interested in using digital transmission to provide wide-screen
programming.

In the UK, the BBC publicised its plan last April (see ATM May 95) to
make wide-screen television the centerpiece of its digital terrestrial
TV strategy.

CANADA:  SEGA CHANNEL CANADA UP

In late January Shaw Cable, Canada's second largest MSO, launched Sega
Channel Canada, a 24-hour interactive game channel on its basic cable
service.  The channel costs C$19.95 a month, almost the cost of the
basic cable service itself.  Shaw launched the service in Victoria, BC,
and in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta.

Shaw officials peg the high costs as being the equivalent of purchasing
or renting C$3,000 worth of games.  To access the system, Shaw
subscribers will need a 16-bit Sega Genesis console.  Shaw will provide
the adapter needed to hook up the game gear to the cable system.

Sega Channel Canada is a 50/50 joint venture between Rogers and Shaw.
Rogers has rolled out the system in Vancouver, BC, and Newmarket, Ont.

Sega Channel Canada will start with 50 titles a month, rotating within
the Sega library of 700 games.  About 70 percent of the games will
change each month.  Successful titles will remain in circulation.

The channel will come with a Password for Parents which will allow
parents to set a time limit on how long the games can be played and
which games children can play.  The content of each game has been rated
by the Entertainment Software Rating Board.  Once Password is turned on
prohibited games cannot be downloaded.

Shaw officials stated that the reason for the limited launch was
because of a shortage of adapters and a desire to practise their
marketing techniques before hitting major eastern markets, slated for
Easter.

UNITED STATES:  DIGITAL PIRATES STRIKE DIRECTV

Leading experts believe that American DBS service DirecTv is under
attack by digital satellite pirates and that the underground trade in
pirate decoders may soon be draining off subscription revenues from one
of every two DBS receiving sets sold.

Bob Sherman of Satellite Business News claimed, "Piracy could become a
huge potential problem here.  It could become the biggest problem
facing DBS.  The only reason that it is not widespread is because there
is a worldwide chip shortage right now and I think that is holding down
distribution."

Jim Shelton of Shelton and Associates, a San Diego-based consulting
firm agrees with Sherman.  "The only reason that it is not widespread
at this time is probably a shortage of computer chips.  A lot of these
chips require a 26-week lead time." Sherman previously worked at
General Instrument's San Diego-based Videocipher division where he
helped end signal piracy on C-Band dishes.  Sherman estimates that it
cost $50 million to put an end to big dish piracy.

At the moment, experts believe that there are only between 5,000 to
10,000 black market DBS decoder cards in operation, but Shelton
believes it is only a matter of time before the piracy mushrooms.  "It
could become rampant.  Once they have plenty of cards, you will see
advertising break out in flyers and faxes offering the cards.  If it
continues unchecked, it won't be long before you see them manufacturing
100,000 receiving units a month, but only 50,000 are being legally
authorised."

The black market access cards are being sold for between $500-700.

DirecTv president Eddy Hartenstein has claimed that he is two steps
ahead of the hackers and that he can foil them with electronic
countermeasures or by issuing new decoder cards.  Both Shelton and
Sherman believe that DirecTv is not doing enough to thwart the digital
satellite pirates, however.  "Electronic counter-measures are a form of
harassment.  The only way to do it is to do a redesign, find out how
they came in and redesign the locks.  It costs about $25 million."

DirecTv refused to comment on the piracy issue, maintaining that
anything it says may betray their intentions to the pirate community.

The case came to light when US immigration and custom agents stopped a
man crossing the US border from British Columbia.  He was detained on a
cellular piracy case and found to be carrying 113 DirecTv access cards.

Canada is one of the centres for the manufacture of the illegal cards
due to previously lax piracy laws.  Now that Canada's laws have been
tightened up, the pirates are settling in the Cayman Islands.  Calgary,
Alberta, however, remains one of the manufacturing centres.

"Typically there are three stages to piracy," said Shelton.  "The first
is a simple cloning of a card authorising all programming.  The second
is called the `Three Musketeers', which uses one authorised card to get
the monthly keys and updates being broadcast.  The third is the `Wizard
Key', whereby the key from a working unit is extracted and distributed
to pirate boxes.  They are already moving into the third stage, which
is very fast."

JAPAN:  DMC GETS ITS OWN WAY

An advisory body of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT)
has started deliberations on revising the limit on the number of
channels a single broadcaster can operate from two to 12.  The Radio
Regulatory Council is also mulling whether to allow an increase in the
number of channels to be beamed by digital satellite service provider
DMC from 50 to 70 and radio channels from 100 to 200.

The current regulations were designed to prevent domination of scarce
analogue channels by a few big media players, but with the launch of
the JSAT-3 digital satellite in August 1995, the number of potential
channels will grow enormously, making room for many more channel
operators.  Also, a major drawing card for the new DMC service is
expected to be NVOD and pay-per-view, which require a large number of
channels per operator to be profitable.

Partly motivated by last year's announcement by Hughes Communications
and four Japanese partners of a plan to launch a 100-channel service in
1997, DMC has told the MPT that it wants to expand its channel bouquet
from 50 to 70, with many of the additional channels to be allocated to
NVOD and pay-per-view services.  Among the operators will be Itochu,
Mitsui & Co.  and other major trading companies.  DMC will begin test
broadcasts this April and commercial broadcasts this September.

DNC won the argument with the cable operators.  Based on the
negotiations of a working group, the board of the Japan Cable TV
Association (JCTA) has accepted a proposal by digital satellite service
provider DMC to have its planned 50-channel service distributed over
cable as well.

The working group had expressed JCTA's concern that DMC's digital
satellite bouquet, which is scheduled to start in June and which
closely resembles current cable offerings, might harm the diffusion of
cable TV.

Although many of the JCTA's 300 member stations are now enjoying growth
in subscriptions after years of recessionary stagnation, more than half
are still operating in the red and TV households receiving multichannel
cable still account for only five percent of the total number of
households.  Prior to the start of talks with DMC in September, JCTA
representatives told the media that the cable industry in Japan could
not easily cope with competition from a digital satellite service.

DMC countered with an offer to provide cable operators with antennas
and other receiving equipment free of charge so that they could relay
DMC broadcasts to their subscribers.  After some hesitation, the JCTA
working group accepted this proposal in November.  Although DMC balked
at a JCTA proposal refraining it from marketing its service in areas
already served by cable, it agreed to negotiate its marketing
arrangements with individual cable stations, paving the way for a
cooperative agreement.

EUROPE:  TALISMAN: DIGITAL PROTECTION

Two pan-European research projects -Talisman and Okapi - are to address
the new challenges presented to creators and rights holders by the
widespread use of digital technologies in the audiovisual industry.
This research is being carried out within the framework of the European
Union's Advanced Communications Technol-ogies and Services (ACTS)
project.

Talisman (Tracing Authors' rights by Labelling Image Services and
Monitoring Access Network) aims to protect EC service providers'
digital products against large-scale commercial piracy and illegal
copying with a standard copyright mechanism.  The project focuses on
video services and will demonstrate the relevance of the mechanisms
around pilot demonstrations covering media like cable and satellite
broadcasting as well as ATM networks for multimedia interactive service
access.

Two technologies are being considered for protecting video sequences.
The first involved the labelling of a digital product, compatible with
the compression standards JPEG for fixed images and MPEG for moving
images.  The tampering of such a protected product will leave "traces"
which invalidate the encrypted label.  The second technology involved
the application of invisible and indelible "tattoos" on the images,
resisting digital compression and decompression and any manipulation.
Both techniques can be used simultaneously.  Furthermore the project
includes the design of monitoring devices connected to networks
allowing on-line auditing and accounting.

One of the research consortium's key objectives is to submit to DAVIC
and DVB a standard copyright mechanism for video protection.  "The
availability of copyright systems managed in a harmonised way will be
essential for all the end users in the field: TV broadcasters,
producers of movies, cassettes, video CDs and interactive CDs," says
the project prospectus.

The project has been awarded to a consortium of 11 partners led by
French company Thomson-CSF and including Hispasat (Spain), CSELT
(Italy), EPFL (Switzerland), ART3000 (France), Fraunhofer Institut
Darmstadt (Germany), Institut Superior Tecnico (Portugal) and four
Belgian partners, Universite Catholique de Louvain, RTBF/UER,
Belgarchive and SACD.

Access control to networked multimedia service is specifically
addressed by the research project Okapi (Open Kernel for Access to
Protected Interoperable interactive services).  The objective is for
the Okapi kernel "to ensure interoperability, openness, equity, user
privacy and evolutivity for opening the European multimedia market to
every potential service provider and user," says the project spec
sheet.  The consortium behind the project will elaborate a standard
kernel for access control systems to be submitted to DAVIC, DVB as well
as the EBU.

Given the synergy between both research projects, several of the 12
Talisman partners are also present in the Okapi consortium.  Its
members include University of Thessaloniki (Greece), Deutsche Telekom
(Ge-rmany), CSELT (Italy), Philips (Nethe-rlands), CCETT (France), EPFL
(Swit-zerland), Fraunhofer Institut Darmstadt (Germany) and four
Belgian entities, RTBF/UER, Pastel (Mons), Universite de Liege and the
Universite Catholique de Louvain, the team leader.

USA:  WILL STATIONS GET ATV SPECTRUM?

Ironically, as the Grand Alliance and Advisory Committee on Advanced
Television Service (ACATS) celebrate the US digital broadcast standard,
the political process threatens to take from broadcasters the spectrum
on which the new standard would be delivered.

Senator Bob Dole, the leading Republican presidential candidate, has
emerged as the chief foe of broadcasters' digital aspirations.  In
recent weeks he has attacked plans to provide broadcasters with a
second advanced TV channel as "corporate welfare" and threatened to
block the pending telecom deregulation bill unless the spectrum is
auctioned or broadcasters are otherwise made to pay for it.

The White House, meanwhile, has expressed support for a different
approach, which would auction broadcasters' existing analogue channels
as early as 2002.  Neither approach is considered acceptable by the
National Association of Broadcasters, which has come out in support of
the telecom bill.

In late January there were signs that the House could vote on the
telecom bill in early February and that the spectrum issue might be
removed from the bill, to be considered separately at some later date.

FRANCE:  FRENCH STATIONS IN DIGITAL LINK

To face Canal Plus, CLT's and AB's digital projects, the French public
broadcaster France Television and its rival TF1 have surprisingly
decided to join forces by creating a common company to set up and to
market digital services.  Named STEPS (Societe de Television Europeenne
de Programmes et de Services), the 50:50 subsidiary will establish a
common subscription system and a compatible settop box.

A similar deal was expected between AB and TF1, rather than with France
Television, because the two companies have worked together for many
years.  The move therefore comes as a surprise at a moment when
competition between the two companies is fiercer than ever, with TF1
losing viewers and France Television's share rising proportionately,
recovering to the level achieved ten years ago.  It will be the first
time since it was privatised in 1987, that the first terrestrial
network is working with its former parent company.

France Television's chairman Jean-Pierre Elkabbach announced that the
launch of digital services will be in two stages.  The first will be
the launch, next March, of an experimental MPEG-2 multiplex of existing
channels such as TF1, France 2, France 3, La Cinquieme and the wide-
screen station Supervision.  The package will be transmitted in the
clear via Eutelsat's Hot Bird.  Elkabbach said that "the choice of the
future digital decoder will probably be decided during the spring,
after we compare the different existing offers."

The TF1/FT digital venture is planned for launch before the end of the
year.

It is understood that the offer will integrate TF1's `Hyperchaone'
concept of digital e la carte TV and the two channels that state-owned
companies Arte, France Television and INA are close to launch on cable,
La Chaone d'Histoire and France Telefilm.  STEPS will market the whole
offer but representatives at the new joint-venture declined to comment
how the parent companies will share the subscriptions to their own
services.

JAPAN:  MARUBENI'S CABLE PC SERVICE

Major trading company Marubeni is getting ready to launch a new cable
TV service that will allow subscribers to use their TV set to access
the Internet, as well as enjoy conventional cable television
programming via a high-speed cable TV LAN.  Marubeni-owned Town
Television Kanazawa, which will begin operations in April, will be the
first to offer the service, starting some time in 1997.  Eventually,
Marubeni intends to extend it to the network of 15 to 20 cable stations
that it plans to build, beginning this year.

To design content for the data transmission portion of the service,
Marubeni will link with a US partner this March to start a planning
company.  In April, it will join with another US company to launch a
planning company for supplying contents for the video portion.  Both US
partners are still unnamed.

At the end of last year, Marubeni, together with Tokyo Cable Network,
IBM Japan, Sumitomo Electric Industrial and other corporate partners
began a trial of a cable TV LAN with 100 cable subscribers in Tokyo's
Bunkyo Ward.

Among the free services on offer during the trial are on-line English
conversation lessons and Internet connections.  The trial is scheduled
to run until the end of the year.  Based on the results, Town
Television will launch a commercial version of the service in 1997.
Using its high-capacity lines, the station will also offer subscribers
a wide range of other services, including video, data, telephone and
games.

Currently the owner of six cable stations, Marubeni plans to expand its
cable network to a total of 15 to 20 stations, primarily in the Tokyo
and Osaka metro areas.  One of the country's largest trading companies,
Marubeni sees the new service as giving a major boost to cable TV
diffusion in Japan.  In association with supermarket chain Daiei,
Marubeni is also selling personal computers installed with Internet
software.

UNITED STATES:  SNET MOVES INTO CATV

As leading US long distance phone companies make investments in DBS
(see front page story), local phone companies continue to pursue a
variety of strategies in the advanced TV arena.

Southern New England Telecom-munications (SNET), for example, recently
asked the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) for a
statewide cable franchise.

The action marks a shift by SNET - which provides phone service to most
of Connecticut - from the video dialtone (VDT) common carrier model to
a strategy of becoming a franchised cable operator.  Among other
things, the latter approach offers more direct control over the
programming carried on a telco's broadband network.

The statewide cable franchise would be operated by a newly formed
subsidiary, SNET Personal Vision.  It would use a hybrid fibre-coax
(HFC) architecture that delivers video, voice and data.  It plans to
offer 76 channels of TV programming.

SNET is currently running an FCC-approved VDT trial that serves roughly
350 homes.

In explaining the shift from the VDT to the cable franchise model,
Patrice Listfield, president of SNET Personal Vision, said "we think
this represents the best business decision for us and for our
customers.  We'll provide the benefits of real cable competition sooner
this way.  And we'll be allowed to give our customers a more
competitive, innovative service on a network with superior technical
quality without some of the encumbrances placed on telephone companies
in the VDT business."

In parts of the state where SNET is not the local telephone company, it
intends to work with Nynex and Woodbury Telephone Company to "develop
arrangements that will allow SNET Personal Vision to offer a cable
alternative in those areas, too."

According to Listfield, the company expects to offer service to 22% of
Connecticut homes and businesses by the end of next year and 36% by
1998.  By 2000, service will be offered to 64% of Connecticut and by
2003, to 81%.  She said the company expects to reach the entire state
by 2009.

In neighboring New Jersey, Bell Atlantic has been busy working on the
most extensive VDT deployment to date and, on 29 January, it officially
launched the commercial service.  Bell Atlantic will make its VDT
system offering available to about 1,000 to 1,500 households per month
according to the construction schedule, ultimately passing all 38,000
homes and businesses in Dover Township.  It is the first commercial
deployment of a VDT service on a fibre-to-the-curb (FTTC) network.

In this final phase of testing, participants will begin using basic
interactive functions, such as ordering "recipes-on-request" from the
TV Food Network.  The latter is one of a package of channels offered by
FutureVision, one of seven video information providers planning to
deliver programming on the Dover network.

FutureVision, which has reserved the most capacity on the 384-channel
FTTC network, will undertake an intensive marketing campaign, including
substantial price discounting, with the goal of quickly capturing large
numbers of subscribers from the incumbent cable operators.

Meanwhile, on the country's other coast, Pacific Bell began 1996 by
halting construction of an HFC network it had begun deploying in Los
Angeles and Orange County.

While the company will continue building HFC networks in the Bay Area
and in San Diego, it apparently will rely on MMDS, or wireless cable,
for its near-term video strategy in the L.A.  and Orange County
markets.  Among the factors driving the decision were problems in
dealing with local officials and the combination of capital constraints
and intense competitive pressures that demanded accelerated HFC
buildouts in the Bay Area and San Diego markets.

EUROPE:  DVB DIGITAL NORM AGREED

A high-performance, widescreen standard for digital terrestrial
television has been ratified by the DVB.  The specifi-cation combines
interactivity with digital sound and picture quality.  It also provides
broadcasters with a two-carrier transmission option.

Ratification of the terrestrial standard completes the DVB line-up of
digital standards, which also cover cable and smatv (DVB-C, using QAM
modulation), satellite (DVB-S, using QPSK modulation), and MMDS (DVB-MC
for under 10GHz systems, using QAM modulation; over 10GHz, DVB-MS,
based closely on the DVB-S spec using QPSK and potentially receivable
via the same settop box).  The new terrestrial option, DVB-T, retains
COFDM modulation, but offers broadcasters the flexibility to choose
between 2k and 8k carriers.  The DVB steering board says the 2k option
will allow an early start for digital TV services in the UK (1997):
broadcasters who begin later (for example, in Spain) will have the
option of using the 8k variant, backwards compatible with the 2k
system.

The decision to adopt COFDM modulation has gone down particularly well
with manufacturer Pace.  With COFDM incorporated into the standard,
Pace is free to develop its common platform settop box which will allow
digital reception of satellite, cable or terrestrial transmissions.

JAPAN:  NTT THINKS INTERACTIVE

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) and TV Interactive
Corporation (TVI), a US-based high-tech venture company, will cooperate
in the development and popularization of a service based on TVl's TVIQ,
a one-way infrared communications interface technology.

TVIQ, which is still under development, allows users to simply touch
pictures or drawings in a specially-printed sheet or booklet to view
motion pictures and other multimedia information stored on CD-ROM or an
other medium via their TV sets or personal computers.

NTT plans to use the TVIQ technology to develop multimedia services
"for elderly persons, children, housewives and other people who are
relatively unfamiliar with multimedia."

In the case of a mail order system, for example, a user could hold a
catalogue linked to a CD-ROM, via infrared signals and, while sitting
in front of a TV connected with a game machine, touch pictures in the
catalogue to receive detailed voice and motion-picture information
about products.  The user would touch a "purchase" button in the
catalogue to place an order using a telephone line.

NTT will invite companies from various fields to jointly study how to
utilize the new interface technology for commercial services.  NTT will
also develop a variety of applications in collaboration with other
companies, including NTT affiliates.

GERMANY:  UNCERTAINTY OVER CLT PLANS

Since Leo Kirch gave up his d-Box project to join the MMBG group, MMBG
members have begun to cancel their original plans.

The latest set of cancellations came from Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de
Telediffusion (CLT).  Employees have told ATM that their company has
put a stop on nearly all hiring for the new digital project studio and
its Cologne marketing arm since last December.

The reason for the delays are said to be disagreement between the two
main shareholders Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) and Havas, and their
heads Albert Frere and Pierre Dauzier and CLT's new manager Michael
Delloye, following Delloye's recommendation that CLT invests a total of
DM1 billion ($695 million) in launching dozens of new digital packages
on Astra.  GBL's chairman Albert Frere is said to be ready to enter a
partnership with the giant Bertelsmann group.

Havas chairman Dauzier was able to get the agreement of the other
shareholders to have CLT join the Canal Plus digital venture with a 25%
stake in the form of staff, studios and programmes.  Originally, CLT
was to have entered the French market on its own.

This still leaves CLT's considerable stake in the German market in a
state of uncertainty and initial plans for 1996 appear to have been
shelved.  Roland Steindorf, marketing manager for RTL-Direct - a CLT
digital package marketing project in Cologne, Germany - denied these
rumours.  "Nothing has happened to alter our plans to enter the German
market with a digital TV bouquet this year." He also denied that the
stop on hiring that his department has implemented since December has
anything to do with these rumours.

USA:  ALLIANCES IN SETTOP SECTOR

General Instrument, the leading supplier of cable TV converters, and
FORE Systems, a leader in ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networking
products, have formed an alliance to jointly develop a high-speed ATM-
based system for use in the hybrid fibre-coax (HFC) networks now being
built by cable operators and some telephone companies.

The move was seen as an endorsement by a leading cable equipment
supplier of the concept of delivering ATM cells all the way to the
home.  The ATM system being developed is designed to link computers at
speeds up to 25 megabits per second, which would enable delivery of
real-time full motion video to home PCs.  It could also be used to
deliver video and multimedia content in ATM format to TV settops.

According to Mike Ozburn, vice president and general manager of GI's
Telecommunications Network Systems Division, GI will work with FORE to
develop an end-to-end ATM system.  The development partnership was
applauded by Craig Mundie, Microsoft senior vice president Consumer
Systems Division.  Noting that "Microsoft has worked closely with FORE
on ATM technology and standards..and with GI on settop box technology,"
Mundie said the partnership will "help speed Microsoft's efforts to
bring new services to PCs and televisions."

Scientific Atlanta, GI's chief rival in the analogue cable converter
market, also announced some new allies in the digital arena.

The company said its PowerKEY digital conditional access system - to be
used in settop terminals and cable modems - will use software licensed
from RSA Data Security and Cylink Corporation.

RSA's license to S-A is the first to a settop manufacturer of the
company's patented technique for private messaging and digital
signature authentification.

JAPAN:  NIPPON TV GOES DIGITAL

Nippon Television Network, Japan's highest-rated commercial TV network,
is mulling the launch of its own digital broadcasting service using the
JCSAT-3 satellite.  Initially, NTV would beam the same programming as
the one currently broadcast nationwide on its analogue terrestrial
network, but it is also planning tests of data, telephony and other
multimedia services.

Although NTV was considering joining the 50 digital channel-bouquet to
be offered this fall by digital satellite service provider DMC, it may
instead lease its own transponder for a period of three years.  One
reason is that the broadcaster wants to conduct a wide range of digital
transmission tests.  Another is money: broadcasting via satellite is
at, Y300 million ($2.86 million) a year, considerably cheaper than
building masts and ground stations to upgrade its network of local
affiliates.  "We have not made a final decision, but this is an option
we are seriously considering," an NTV spokesman said.  "We have also
not yet decided how many channels or what kind of services we will
broadcast."

FRANCE:  REPORT SLAMS FRENCH TELCO

French minister for Posts, Telecom-munications and Space, Francois
Fillon, unveiled at the beginning of January the main points of the
report he ordered last September from Georges Vanderchmitt, a former
adviser of French audit body Cour des Comptes.  Fearing that France
could miss out in the digital race by having too many digital bouquet
projects, Fillon demanded a clear overview of the country's policy on
satellite telecommunications.

The Vanderchmitt report recommends the creation of a "digital super
alliance'' between all the major French players, (public and private)
with broadcasters' access to the settop boxes ensured "under fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions".  The report insists on
the necessity to guarantee competition among the players inside the
alliance while having a strong policy on an external offer.  Thanks to
digital technology, the latter should be adapted to the different
geographical zones it targets.

Vanderchmitt foresees that the digital market should be supervised
together by the CSA and the Conseil de la Concurrence (competition
body).

Fillon revealed that he has ordered another report from former TDF
general director Philippe Levrier on whether or not to develop digital
terrestrial television.

USA:  SI DIAMOND'S LCD ADVANCES

SI Diamond Technology (SIDT), which is developing a flat panel Diamond
Field Emission Display (DFED), has announced a breakthrough in high
intensity lighting that promises improved backlighting for LCDs (liquid
crystal display), which today dominate the flat panel market.
Northlight Displays, an SIDT subsidiary, has used diamond-coated
cathodes to produce a high luminance lamp without the use of a heated
filament.  The result, says the company, is a more efficient, easy-to-
manufacture high intensity lighting source.

Most high-intensity lights used in specialised applications provide
luminance in the 1,000-6,000 footlambert range.  High-luminance
backlights employing heated cathodes can reach about 10,000
footlamberts and are currently used for avionic AMLCD (active matrix
LCD) applications.  However, these devices are relatively inefficient
and have other environmental limitations.

According to SIDT, the lamp assembly tested by Northlight exceeds
luminance of 20,000 footlamberts.  Howard Schmidt, SIDT chairman and
CEO says the company is "currently in the process of developing sealed
units and evaluating our options for commercializing this technology,
while at the same time continuing development of the DFED."

UK:  UK LAUNCH FOR SEGA CHANNEL

The first dedicated end-to-end games delivery system in the UK is
expected to be Telewest Communication's roll out of the Sega Games
Channel in its South East UK franchise area, which had been forecast to
launch last year.

A formal announcement of a new release date is expected imminently
following renewed negotiations between TCI International (a major
stakeholder in Telewest) and Sega Enterprises over licensing and
royalties.

Some 25 leading Sega games will be available to subscribers who will
simply plug an adapter into the cartridge slot of the Sega Megadrive
consoles - or a special module into the new General Instruments 2200
settop box.  The Sega Channel module would cost around $200.  The
system incorporates parental controls and code to block transmission of
unsuitable titles.

Because the channel occupies a narrow bandwidth it can be used
alongside existing networked channels featuring a wide tuning range,
and narrow band data camers.  Cable companies would transmit the games
via their optical fibre cable on an unlimited access basis to
subscribers paying $15 to $18 per month, using a dedicated $22,500
headend server.

Sega games service set boxes are now available for European MSOs, and
the channels are expected to launch in Europe during Autumn.  Flextech,
controlled by TCI, would have the rights to launch Sega games channels
in the UK, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Denmark, and the move is in
line with Flextech's plans to develop new programming for cable and
satellite.

CHALLENGES OF SELLING 16/9 SETS

Widescreen television enthusiasts point to France where the installed
base of 16/9 sets accounts for half of the European total.  Of late,
the attraction of the product seems to be under question as falling
sales figures show.  Yves Dupre offers a personal, and candid, view of
the symptoms and remedies

It was in 1991 that 16/9 television receivers were first introduced on
to the French market by Thomson which, at that time, was a pioneering
and risky move.

However, at the beginning of the 90s, projects were still being carried
out in Europe on high definition television and this launch was to a
large extent linked to these.

16/9 receivers were initially quite expensive, starting at the same
price as a Fiat Panda car.  This did not stop them capturing the `early
adopters', customers who were wealthy enough to snap up new ideas, but
who were not representative of the actual buying trends.

A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then; high definition is
no longer news.  Television is now turning towards digital technology,
the "opportunity for the 16/9" (which has failed to touch the public's
imagination), as well as multimedia which has literally exploded, but
in which the large screen does not occupy a privileged position.  For
their part, consumers themselves have changed since the first 16/9 sets
appeared on the scene.  This is due to economic problems.  Their
motivations and habits have been radically changed.  Without high
definition, and despite these changes, manufacturers have kept their
ranges and even extended them.  Large screen TV sets can be found in
practically all retail outlets, and generally a specialist shop or
large store has several models depending upon size, from three to six
models on average.

Personally speaking and as a journalist specialising in retailing, I
visit points of sale practically very day.  Through the confidences of
contacts and friends throughout the business I began to suspect that
sales of large screen televisions were experiencing a few problems.
There are however signs which are not misleading.  For example, I
observed that a certain number of points of sale, not all of course but
enough to set me thinking, are displaying them at the back of the
store.  I am not saying at the front of the display but well to the
bottom of the shelf and I know that the items which sell well are not
generally consigned to the back of the store.

At the present time we professionals must not avoid the facts.  Despite
considerable efforts on the part of the manufacturers the results for
the sales of 16/9 sets are quite bad.  In France, the first three
quarters of 1995 were marked by an appreciable downturn for the 16/9
sets of at least 12%, perhaps even more - 15% say certain observers -
expressed in terms of the numbers of sets sold.  This information has
come from the best sources.  There is no point in saying that as far as
turnover is concerned and with the remorseless price competition, a
decline which is even more significant in terms of value has been
ascertained.  It is a phenomenon all the more disquieting as it is
happening at the same time as sales of the larger sizes of screen are
growing (the 27-inch model, for example, increased by more than 20%).

I should add that the social problems which are troubling France at the
present time are in the process of completely ruining the end-of-year
sales figures, at the most important time of the season.

In France, we must therefore face the truth that the large screen is
not managing to capture the hearts and minds of the public.

Some of you will find these figures amazing because we have heard other
speeches where larger amounts and considerable increases were announced
by the manufacturers.  The problem is that we must not confuse the
quantities being shipped by the manufacturers to the retailers and the
products being sold to consumers.  The number of models on sale had
widened to a large extent between autumn `94 and `95, but especially
towards the end of `94.  At the same time, a large number of points of
sale finally put the 16/9 sets on their shelves, particularly as, at
this time, the prices of the products had fallen significantly.  From
the price of a Fiat Panda we had reached that of a modest mountain
bike.  In France, there are about 1,000 hypermarkets, 2,000 specialist
stores and about 5,000 specialists points of sale.  That makes 7,000 to
8000 points of sale currently dealing with TV sets.  By supplying only
five display models per shop, throughout the whole of this retailing
sector, that makes between 30,000 and 40,000 sets sold to the shops,
but not necessarily sold to the consumers.  The manufacturers' figures
were therefore correct or just slightly overestimated.  But sales to
the consumer, that's another story altogether.

There is one important calculation to enable us to get a better picture
of what the 16/9 represents for the stockists.  Today, all the
observers acknowledge that the large screens do not exceed 2% of the
total television market.  If we estimate this market on the high side,
say 3.5 million sets, this means a maximum of 70,000 large screens a
year.  But if you divide this quantity by the number of points of
sales, you see that each of them on average only sells 10 sets a year
which is not even one a month.

A certain degree of caution is called for when examining the course of
action taken by the European manufacturers against what they say in
public: if Philips and Thomson are multiplying the initiatives for the
sizes already launched, Thomson has finally deferred the launch of its
"small" 16/9 whilst Nokia has quite simply temporarily withdrawn from
the large TV market.  Many eyes are now turned towards Germany as it is
expected that it will be the "trend-setter" with Palplus.

But let's forget the figures and look at the noticeable change in
consumers' habits.  We must unfortunately record that this
transformation is not favourable to the way in which 16/9 sets are
being offered for sale at the moment as economic difficulties and
unemployment are on the increase.  By and large, consumers are also not
quite as young, already quite well equipped and more mature in their
thinking.  They have become more moderate and attentive when making
their purchases.  They only go for sound values, and what is more, at
the best price.  They are well informed and remorselessly reject
products which do not bring them concrete and tangible benefits.  They
have dreams of the future, but buy in the present.

Large screens are present at the points of sale, but salespeople
testify to the fact that customers know little about them.  Often they
realise that new screens exist when facing the shelves.  And department
managers say that customers who come to buy a good television often go
away with nothing if they only start to hesitate between a widescreen
and a normal one.  Perhaps this hesistant customer must replace his
television which has suddenly broken down.  In this case, instead of
opting for an expensive set, he is happy with a cheap one which is not
good for the sales teams who make their living thanks to a percentage
on the sales realised.  In short, if a salesperson does not want to
lose a sale it is often better not to talk about the 16/9 set too much.

Even if the products are really superb, as far as the layman is
concerned this simple increase in the picture width is only considered
as very modest progress.

Consumer electronics equipment available in the shops today offers a
real revolution for everyone from the small telephones which can be
slipped into your pocket and which enables you to communicate
throughout Europe, right up to the fascinating applications made in
computers and CD-Rom, for example, where sales are exploding.  In this
instance it is not 10 sales a year, but 10 a day.  Even in the field of
pictures, video projectors and home cinema systems with Dolby sound or
THX, as in large halls, sales are high and are transforming people's
leisure time.

There is no point, here, to debate whether widening the TV screen is
justified or not.  Everything revolves round one unique problem: it is
the lack of programmes for the new format.  That is the crux of the
matter for the 16/9 format.

No programme can be picked up for the time being with just a receiver:
one needs at least a satellite or cable system, equipment which is not
very widespread in France.  And since our theme was entitled "what
marketing strategy for large screens", we should not hesitate to say
that the question boils down to the marketing of 16/9 programmes.

Well, then, what are we going to do about large screens? There is much
talk about modifying the size of films received in letter box, about
stretching them on to the screen to fill it.

I must say somewhat critically that I am very much against this myself
because the retail stores tend to use this zooming effect on a
conventional 4/3 set to fill in a demonstration 16/9 model.  Even if
certain manufacturers are tempted to convince us that many programmes
are "zoomable", this is incorrect.  Television does not just show
films.  The bulk of the programming is something other than films.

If the 4/3 picture is stretched, the characters appear squashed or the
heads and feet of the dancers are cut off.  Customers who wander around
the department see these faults.

And it is a poor solution: in intellectual terms no-one can say that he
can be satisfied with cocking a snook at logic.  We have not really
created such efficient products to resign ourselves to only showing
normal pictures in a deformed version.

The example of Japan is often quoted to me.  This formula seems to work
there but in Japan the 16/9 set also benefits from the large screen
video game market.  And for my part I know that European customers are
neither Japanese nor American customers.

Europeans are more demanding.  There is plenty of proof of this all
around us.  Our industries have been successful with products which are
largely more sophisticated than in many other parts in the world; our
fast trains, our planes, our numerical cellular telephones and even our
audovisual are much more efficient.

Returning to our theme of marketing for the 16/9, my thoughts suddenly
turn to vehicles which run on liquid petroleum gas, the famous LPG
which France is going to try to relaunch in 1996.  LPG is economical,
non-polluting, does not make the engine noisy, does not make our hands
dirty, does not smell bad.  With all these drivers said bravo but added
that LPG can be found practically nowhere; simply install the pumps
then we can adopt this mode of transport.  I believe we must similarly
install pumps for programmes.

To develop the 16/9 format the manufacturers must obviously get heavily
involved, as a matter of urgency, in a mass broadcasting of programmes
using the existing channels.  Manufacturers who are proposing large
screen television receivers are not so timid about programmes in many
other areas.

Some of them have bought film studios or are amongst the principal
phonographic editors in the world.  They have not hesitated to launch
programme divisions to create software intended for multimedia.

They will have to grab the market with both hands and do the same for
television as a matter of urgency; become creators and broadcasters of
large screen programmes (it can even be done profitably).

It is also necessary that they think about editing; films on cassettes,
when they are in cinemascope which is often the case, will have to
receive systematically a small logo indicating to the consumer "better
on 16/9".  Even a note for the videodisc.  What problem would, say,
Philips have in introducing the idea of a 16/9 screen on its CD-i or
even its video CD.

It is not providence which is going to enrich the 16/9 world.  As
things stand at the moment, I am very much afraid that the promoters of
the large screen will have to invest a lot of money over a long period
of time before they can impose the new form of screen.  And for how
long? It took between 15 to 20 years for colour television to become
commonplace in France.

I suggest that the industrialists and programme professionals get
together to create a world of pictures which can very quickly, and
without too much investment, become large enough to motivate the
customers.

This period should be considered as a time for pioneers and we must
live and act like them.  Don't wait for governments, committees or even
the Holy Spirit of favourable initiatives.

We must roll up our sleeves and I am sure that if things take off we
will be saying in one or two years time that consumers are becoming
increasingly worried about buying something other than a large screen.

In a word, television receivers are here to stay.  All it takes is for
the show to start.

NTT BREAK UP

An advisory body to Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications
has agreed on a plan to break up the nation's largest telecom, NTT,
into a long-distance and several regional telephone companies.  The
members of the MPT's Telecommunications Council believe that such a
plan would promote greater competition and more effective management in
the telecommunications industry, which NTT currently dominates.  At the
end of February the Telecommuni-cations Council will issue a report
detailing how the divestiture should be carried out, including the
number of new regional telecoms.  However, a report by the Economic
Planning Agency, opposing NTT's divestiture, expressed concern that a
breakup of NTT will cause Japan to fall even further behind the US in
the race to build an information superhighway.

as well.  By the next meeting, slated for March in Seoul, South Korea,
DAVIC must achieve sufficient consensus on the cable-modem and data-
delivery protocols to issue a document for circulation among members.
Given the organization's commitment to meeting the needs of multiple

controversial move that would set aside a valuable slice of the
airwaves to be used for a new generation of digital services, including
HDTV.  Dole argues that a provision in the new telecommunications bill,
backed by the Republicans, is "giant corporate welfare".  In effect,
the bill gives broadcasters new digital licences, which he values at
between $12.5 billion and $70 billion, for free.  The National
Association of Broadcasters is urging President Clinton to overrule
Dole's demand that they pay for the airwave space.

DTI PROPOSALS FOR DIGITAL TV

The UK's Department of Trade and Industry has published its proposals
for the regulation of conditional access systems - scrambling,
encryption and subscriber management - for digital television.  The
regulation of conditional access, as required by the EC Directive on
Television Standards, would be by way of licences issued under the
Telecommunications Act and enforced by Oftel, "in close co-operation
with the ITC." The government has refused the ITC's request to regulate
conditional access, saying this is because conditional access works
through data streams carried over telecoms networks, and that these
networks are a key part of the delivery of pay-TV.

TIME COMPUTER SYSTEMS WITHDRAWS RANGE

PCTV equipment sales have been so bad in the UK that Time Computer
Systems has withdrawn its range.  Time - which claims to be the UK's
largest direct supplier of computers - has been selling PCTVs since
July.  Instead, it is now offering multimedia PCs with optional PCTV
cards.  John Clare, group chief executive of Dixons Stores Group, has
also found PCTV sales sluggish, although in line with expectations,
with TV cards the preferred option.  "Customers don't see the PC and TV
as the same product," he said.

SALES OF VIDEO-ON-DEMAND SERVERS TO INCREASE

Sales of video-on-demand servers will increase from $131 million in
1994 to more than $1.3 billion in the year 2000, according to Video-On-
Demand - Technology and Economics, a new report from Hodge Computer
Research.  The leading forces in these VOD efforts will be telephone
and cable television operators, the report concludes.  Hodge predicts
that VOD server pricing will fall from $1.35 million in 1995 to
$797,000 in 2000.  NVOD deliveries are expected to drop from $350,000
in 1995 to $206,000 at the end of the decade.

ESTEE LAUDER TO INVEST IN SATELLITE TELEVISION STATION

US cosmetics firm Estee Lauder is considering investing $50 million in
a planned Taiwanese satellite television station, a spokesman for the
station said.  All People's TV, whose founders hope will become
Taiwan's first new television station since liberalisation of the
broadcasting industry in 1994, needed paid-in capital of T$3 billion, a
spokesman said.  Taiwan already has three satellite TV stations, in
which the ruling Nationalist Party, the Taiwan Provincial Government,
the Education Ministry and the Defence Ministry hold major stakes.
Many of the founders the All People's TV are members of the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party.

TOUGH 1997 AHEAD, SAYS CHUA ROBERT CHUA SHARES HIS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON
ASIA WITH NEAL WEINSTOCK

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

"It's very tough going now in Asia," says Robert Chua. Chua is the
founder and CEO of the Hong Kong-based, Chinese language, family
entertainment channel, CETV.

Though CETV's programming philosophy is, "no sex, no violence, no
politics", Chua is one of the more refreshingly candid TV industry
leaders in the region.

A Singaporean who felt he had to move to Hong Kong to work in the
industry, who then had a large part in building TVB's programming
dominance, and who now runs what a recent independent survey calls
the top-rated overseas satellite channel in China, Chua also has a
uniquely broad perspective on Asian TV.

On Western-based programme services in China: "I know that
(Disney's) ABC has had a lot of problems." The company's two
locally produced programmes, Panda Club and Dragon Club, "are going
downhill. Some stations are dropping them. That's going to be
happening to all the Western companies in China.

"The profits aren't what they thought it could be when they went
in."

On running an international satellite service: "I want to just
concentrate on mainland China now. To tell the truth, people are
not going to spend one single cent to advertise on us just to reach
an audience in Indonesia.

"Taiwan is weak for us, too they want to see more sex and violence,
when we have to focus on being a family channel. Even a family
channel means very different things from country to country, so I
don't think an international channel makes so much sense now."

CETV is a fascinating example in how ownership and programming
inter-relate, and how they often do not.

Chua sold a large minority stake in CETV last year to International
Family Entertainment (IFE), the parent of America's and Europe's
Family Channels and a large producer of programming. IFE is owned
by US Christian television preacher and conservative activist Pat
Robertson, who may seem a strange bedfellow for a mainland Chinese
channel.

Yet the only cultural conflict in the relationship so far, says
Chua, has been the one that would be most obvious to viewers - and
least obvious, perhaps, to international TV executives: "A family
channel in the West has very different values than in Asia.

To date we have not taken any of IFE's programmes. There are two
reasons for that. Number one, the family values are different.
Number two, what we are prepared to pay. We can only afford low
fees for shows."

Nonetheless, CETV carries many imported programmes: National
Geographic, films from Hallmark and ACI, Venezuelan telenovelas
from Coral Pictures, many cartoons, and an "edited version" of
NHK's business report.

"Content-wise, we are very much curtailed," he continues. "We have
to be very, very creative. We have to spend lots of time on
programming. Otherwise we'd become an educational channel. That's a
very close thing to a family channel in China, very different than
the West."

One new example of CETV programming is the two-part documentary,
"Hong Kong: Countdown to July 1, 1997." With a plan to focus on
visual changes and residents' feelings, Chua is resolute in
maintaining that this series on a most political event will be
"soft news, non-political." That's a hard balancing act to pull
off.

More on the Hong Kong changeover: "After '97, we'll consider a move
to mainland China. I want to establish and run a professional
outfit here (in Hong Kong) first, that can manage a move of part of
the operation to someplace like Guangzhou later on. We're running
160 staff now, you know. That's a very lean operation."

On international channels in general, and English-language channels
especially: "There are so many channels going now to Asia. We are
all having very tough going right now. There are too many English
channels now, really.

"Do you know where the market is for all these English-language
channels? I don't know where there are so many people who speak
English. Doing Chinese channels is not easy, though. There's not
enough talent. There's no way for new channels to get onto cable;
getting penetration is very difficult."

On advertising: Chua has a very happy story to tell these days,
with the China-based X&L Marketing Service having recently released
a 14-city study showing CETV to be the highest-rated overseas
satellite channel in Chinese cable homes.

Still, "The ad market is tough because of ratings in China; there
are no good ratings services yet. We are now putting our act
together. We've just changed our advertising and sales department;
it's 90 per cent changed from a year ago."

On why TVB's growth has slowed in recent years: "Maybe losing S.K
Fung (to NBC) was a big reason."

On Singapore's TV business environment: "Singapore's opening up.
There are a lot of benefits now for the industry, tax benefits, for
example. But there are not enough people in production. Hong Kong
has more than 10,000 local talent in the TV industry; 3,000 at TVB
alone, 3,000 in the studios. Well over 10,000. Singapore is still
importing people. It should have developed local talent a long time
ago. Now, there's no reason why it can't get there, but it takes
time.

"Also, Singapore in the past had too much government control. Even
now that TCS is supposed to be privatised, there can't really be
enough competition without separating control of channel 5 and
channel 8.

"There's truly not enough competition. I did ask three years ago
for a terrestrial licence there, and we've not yet gotten it. I'd
give them a run for their money."

On Asian stations and TV technology: "I don't think our level in
Asia is up to the West's. We're a new station and we need to keep
spending down, find ways to produce things cheaply. Not everyone
has that need, though. Look at CPN; they spent US$30 million on
just technology for everything digital.

"It's wonderful to have that, if you have the money. If not, well,
we don't do news, so we can get by cheaper. We don't need digital;
simple programmes don't require it. Instead, we spend on talent,
which is quite limited."  '

MINERVA INTROS DVD ENCODING SOLUTION

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Minerva Systems has introduced the Compressionist 250 for the
creation of digital video disc (DVD) video assets.

The DVD format expands the capacity of 5-inch discs to 4.7 Gb - or
133 minutes of high-quality MPEG-2 compressed digital video and AC-
3 or MPEG-2 surround sound audio with multiple language sub-titles
on a single-sided version of the back-to-back bonded disc.

The 250, based on C-Cube Microsystems' VLSI processors, offers both
Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and Variable Bit Rate (VBR) MPEG-2 encoding
technology combined with Minerva's video pre-processing and control
software tools.

Minerva's DVD encoding system also supports leading third-party AC-
3 and MPEG-2 audio encoders, and DVD authoring and disc formatting
tools.

When encoding film-originated content for NTSC delivery, the unit's
inverse telecine feature accurately restores the incoming video's
24 frames per second during the encoding process.

The 250's application control software, Minerva Studio, provides an
easy-to-use interface for both single-pass and multi-pass MPEG-2
VBR encoding.

In multi-pass mode, the Compressionist 250 first profiles the video
sequence by gathering statistics and determines the optimum
allocation of the available bits to the compressed sequence.

In the second pass, the Minerva encoder performs real-time encoding
while controlling the bit rate according to the bit allocation
strategy determined in the first pass.

Optionally, Minerva Studio control software enables users to
optimize and reencode the video source based on their artistic
judgment.

The 250 supports D1, YUV, S-Video and composite video input and
video resolutions up to the CCIR 601 digital standard for NTSC (720
x 240 at 60 fields per second) and PAL (720 x 288 at 50 fields per
second) and variable compressed data rates ranging from 2 to
10Mbps.

The unit is currently shipping with a base system price of
US$99,000.

QUESTECH 1012 DECODER NOW WITH SYNCHRONISER

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

QUESTECH's 1012 composite to serial digital encoder is now
available with a plug-in synchroniser option which provides a
separately timed output from the decoder, effectively making it two
products in one.

As a decoder, the unit provides a quality interface between
composite and serial digital component video equipment. It accepts
both analogue and optionally, digital (D2 or D3 format) inputs and
outputs signals.

The 1012 is the first decoder from the manufacturer which handles
all variants of PAL and NTSC signals and complements the company's
existing range of interface products. The unit digitises incoming
analogue signals with 10 bit resolution.  All signals processing
and conversions are then performed digitally.

A full bandwidth adaptive comb filter decoder separates the
luminance and chrominance signals in the digital domain and the
signals are transparently rate converted, interleaved and
serialised to form the output signal. EDH coding is incorporated to
assist in system evaluation and quality control.

The synchroniser is controlled from menu-driven front panel
controls and can either be used to retime the unit decoder output,
or a separate auxiliary output.  It is compatible with 50Hz and
60Hz systems and allows freezing on either field.

Output timing can be adjusted throughout an entire video frame.

DPA4060 MINIATURE MIC

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

POSSIBLY the smallest product launch of 1996, the new
omnidirectional DPA4060 from Danish Pro Audio has been designed for
use with wireless systems in theatres or on television, wherever
microphones need to be mounted on a performer.

It will fit most VHF and UHF systems for professional use, and is
rather robust.

The unit uses a new 5.4mm pre-polarised condenser cartridge with a
vertical diaphragm. It can handle SPLs to a maximum of 134dB, and
has an on-axis frequency response of 20Hz to 20kHz +/-2dB.

It has a dynamic range of 97dBA (THD = 1%) and there is 13dB of
headroom before clipping occurs.

Connection options include factory mounted connectors for the most
popular systems, or the 'pig tail' (without connectors).

HP TEST SOLUTION FOR DIGITAL SET-TOP BOXES, DEVICES

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Hewlett-Packard recently introduced at IBC 96, the industry's first
test source designed to help equipment manufacturers and cable TV
operators bring new digital-video products and services to market
quickly and efficiently.

The test source, the HP E4441A DVB QAM coder, is designed to help
set-top box and device makers develop and produce high-quality
Digital Video Broadcasting-Cable (DVB-C)-compliant equipment.

The new coder operates in conjunction with HP's latest family of
ESG signal generators to provide a reference radio-frequency (RF)
signal. This signal can be modified and impaired in a controlled
manner to test the limits of receiver design and improve
manufacturing process control. The HP E4441A also is designed to
help cable TV operators optimize network performance and manage
interoperability issues.

The manufacturers believe that the HP E4441A DVB QAM coder will
become an important part of any Bit-Error-Rate (BER) test system
because it can be configured to perform a variety of tests to give
users maximum test coverage. Users can easily change symbol rate,
constellation size and channel coding at the touch of a button.

The unit generates extremely accurate QAM (Quadrature Amplitude
Modulation) signals, which can be impaired in a calibrated manner.

The amount of noise, added to the signal internally, can be
controlled to characterize receivers and networks. Users also may
test DVB-C network equipment in ideal or non-ideal signal
conditions to get "real-world" test data.

The new coder is the result of HP's continued work within the DVB
Project, an industry consortium organized to set standards for
delivering compressed digital video.

The DVB Measurements Group, which develops measurement techniques
and definitions, is an important link for enabling the rapid
deployment of new digital-video services using DVB-C technology.

NEWSWORKS TURBO NOW WITH BETACAM SP QUALITY

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Delivering Beta-SP equivalent picture quality to newsroom users,
the new Newsworks Turbo editing system was launched recently by
Tektronix at IBC '96.

Fully integrated with the classic 'intuitive' user-interface
featured in all Lightworks editing systems, its major applications
include 'direct to air' operations. Immediately available, it is
targeted both as low-cost, low maintenance stand-alone replacement
for existing tape-based linear suites and as a key component of
large-scale automated and networked newsroom systems.

The new introduction is offered as a chargeable option for existing
Newsworks editing system customers. The system effective doubles
the first version's Hi-Res performance to the near Beta-SP level of
5 minutes per Gigabyte  - 10 minutes previously - or equivalent to
4:1 compression running at around 24 Mbit/s.

This is achievedby stripping alternative fields of video
information - and similarly audio channels - over a pair of
material hard drives. For the user, across a single pair, this
provides for a continuous recording of up to 20 minutes - or up to
40 minutes at the 10 minutes per Gigabyte standard.

Fully 'backwards' compatible with earlier 10-minutes per Gigabyte
non-striped material, Turbo will also support mixed compression
rates within the same project or edit.

It employs industry-standard storage options - 9Gb drives in a
variety of configurations up to 90 Gb in a standard unit and
expandable externally via SCSI driver cards to 180 Gb.

Central to the system's ability to deliver the full value of non-
linear editing to the newsroom and achieve significant gains in
operational speed, is the 'Edit-to-It' feature.

This allows direct editing of late arriving tapes with select, trim
and preview on tape under console control. Once selected, material
- with handles - is digitised via a simple commit command and is
available for immediate or future changes.

'Edit-to-It' will also now control a channel of Tek's Profile
Professional Disk Recorder (PDR). This allows Profile PDR-stored
material to be accessed directly and employed in an edit
immediately.

Other key benefits include further operational acceleration with
direct 'voice-over record'.

This allows recording of a single audio channel while playing other
picture and sound channels at an edit station simultaneously (or
recording a picture while sound is playing); direct 'Play-to-Air'
either under manual, newsroom computer or external control from an
automation system via RS422 emulating a BVW75 VTR. New as well is
'StripView', a visual timeline representing both pictures and sound
in the cut and allowing individual shot identification and dynamic
trims and changes.

In addition, the Turbo is supplied as standard with eight real
internal digital audio channels - expandable externally via one or
two Pro Sound boxes.

The Newsworks Turbo systems are immediately available world-wide.

NEW THOMSON PRODUCTS AT IBC

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

TWO of several new products that Thomson Broadcast Systems
introduced at IBC were the Microcam split head compact camera and
4005 dockable Betacam SX recorder.

The Microcam, for ENG or EFP applications, is based on the 1657
camera, with the CCD block used remotely to provide a small and
very manoeuverable camera. The CCD block can be re-mounted on the
camera body for conventional use.

The Microcam is useful in many shooting situations, in particular
when the cameraman is in an awkward position, such as on a
motorcycle or concert platform, yet still wants to be creative with
shooting angles.

Its small size makes it suited to remotely controlled or robotic
applications such as parliamentary broadcasting, where it is
discreet in operation, as well as to crane and jib use.

The Microcam is the only compact camera on the market that is
available in 16/9 format today.

The new 4005 Dockable Betacam SX recorder is connected to the 1657
camera in the same way as the 3505 Betacam SP recorder, with
digital recording to maintain the quality of the picture produced
by the 1657.

Recording is 4:2:2 digital component at 8 bit resolution, using the
MPEG-2 4:2:2 Studio Profile level compression algorithm.

SGI DEBUTS MULTI-CHANNEL SERVER

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Silicon Graphics has announced that it will debut its Multi-Channel
Playback (MCP). The MCP Server enables the management, scheduling
and playout of multiple-channels of stored MPEG-2 compressed
digital video, audio and data.

The MCP Server is designed to meet the needs of multi-channel
service providers such as broadcast, satellite and cable TV
networks and operators.

In addition to the expansion of the traditional broadcast market,
multi-channel playout is key to the growth of the emerging Near
Video on Demand (NVOD) market, which offers viewers closely
staggered start times of movies as well as special pay-per-view
events.

The enabling technology of the MCP Server is Silicon Graphics
multi-channel playback software. The software's open, object-
oriented architecture is completely scaleable, allowing from 10 to
over 300 output streams and more than 1,000 hours of compressed
video storage.

The MCP software is network-independent, supporting any network
topology. Networks supported include satellite and terrestrial
services such as Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Services and
Hybrid-Fibre Coax .

The MCP Server will be generally available in January 1997.

TEK LIGHTWORKS VIP 4500 AT IBC

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Designed to bring the benefits of the nonlinear revolution to the
owners and users of online suites, the Lightworks VIP 4500 editing
system - the first of a new generation of online broadcast editing
solutions from Tektronix - was launched at IBC '96.

Aimed at replacing conventional multiple-VTR online tape-based
editing systems in broadcast television and facilities companies
the Lightworks VIP 4500 system offers a smooth and cost-effective
migration path to the non-linear world.

The new system has full capabilities to control external devices -
such as DVEs, vision mixers (switchers) and character generators -
as well as offering its own complementary on-board titling and
effects. The system complements Tektronix' existing range of
offline and news editing systems (Lightworks Turbo, Heavyworks and
Newsworks systems - and the new Newsworks Turbo, simultaneously
launched at IBC '96. (See page 40)

Targeted initially at online finishing of broadcast television
projects, it features recording and playout configurable via
multiple fully-assignable broadcast-quality video channels. The
system also combines comprehensive offline and online facilities
suitable for all forms of editing. Priced at US$149,950 for its
core four channel configuration, key launch customers include
Sweden's TV4 and the UK's Central Television.

First shipments began after IBC, with world-wide availability by
end-1996.

IT'S A KIND OF CONVERGENCE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by Neal Weinstock

Network computers" that incorporate digital video decoders. Full-
motion video on Internet sites. TV tuner cards and MPEG decoder
cards for home PCs. Video capture programmes that allow typical
home users to grab frames, customise still images, and build their
own digital photo libraries.

Consumer nonlinear editing systems from Avid Technology, Radius,
Fast Electronic, and many others. The PC and the TV are cross-
breeding in consumers' homes, mutating into multiple new forms, and
the TV industry may never be the same again.

Or, some of the new creations may not work at all in the
marketplace.

The Network Computer

Look at the new concept of the network computer (NC). It was
invented by Oracle chief Larry Ellison in a speech in 1994 - in
what he has said was a spur-of-the-moment inspiration - though
naysayers insist the concept of underpowered PCs relying on
mainframes to supply data has been around as long as the used
computer market.

Ellison challenged the hardware industry with the goal of building
a device with nothing more than a keyboard, lots of RAM, some ROM
chips to hold the small client side of a big client/server
operating system, and a very fast processor.

The unit would rely on a network for storage of all programmes and
on a TV screen as monitor, and could therefore sell for US$500, he
said.

The NC was embraced by IBM soon after Ellison's speech. After all,
it is essentially a re-awakening of the mainframe/dumb terminal
model that prevailed when Big Blue ran the computer industry.

From Receivers to Computers

It was also embraced by consumer electronics companies such as Sony
and Philips as a bridge from their stagnant TV receiver trade into
the home computer business. Sony and Philips became early
manufacturers of terminals for the start-up WebTV (which also sells
terminals under its own name).

For US$3300 to US$350, the three companies have just introduced
WebTV terminals that include V.34 modems, software for easy
Internet access (for a monthly fee of US$20), and the ability to
connect numerous add-ons such as a wireless keyboard, hard disk and
CD-ROM.

Ellison's call was echoed from a distance by the drive towards
digital TV decoders. As the needs of the rival systems aimed at
Europe and the North American hybrid digital/analogue standard
became clear, these decoders also were seen to require ROM loaded
with the client side of a network operating system and a very fast
processor. But they don't need much, or any, RAM, and they need
only a keypad, rather than a keyboard. They certainly use the TV as
monitor, though.

Linking Up With Decoders

So some of the companies that took Ellison up on his challenge,
including Sun Microsystems and Sony, began to confer with or even
join forces with the decoder makers, such as Thomson and Irdeto.

"We might combine the digital TV decoder and the network computer,"
says a Sun insider, "or we might just design them together and use
the efficiencies to drive down costs."

Sun has been drawn into these opportunities by its Java and Hot
Java software; that hot Internet stuff suddenly seems to make at
least as much sense for digital TV as similar software aimed at our
industry in recent years by the likes of Apple and IBM's now
defunct Kaleida co-venture, Microware's David, Irdeto, Philips, and
News Datacom.

But if digital TV decoders are to be like Internet terminals, they
also can be Internet terminals. And, as the bandwidth of the
Internet expands, as "applet" software such as Java improves, and
as streaming servers improve, TV programmes will increasingly be
delivered over the Internet.

TV Over the Internet

They already are, in low quality and quantity. As reported here
recently, such streamer software companies as Vosaic (in
combination with Microsoft and its Java-competitor Active X), Xing
Technology, VDOnet, and Vivo Software are already sending MPEG-
quality video at up to 15fps to ISDN connections anywhere on the
globe.

A network computer that is combined in one module with a digital TV
decoder could let viewers switch channels from broadcast to an
Internet video stream.

Some broadcasters are getting ready for this eventuality.

"Right now, a Web site is an ancillary service," says Steven Heyer,
president/CEO of Turner Advertising Sales and chief of Turner's
international networks. "People can find out TV schedules, more
about news stories or spots. At some point, the Web site becomes
the entertainment or the product, and the TV network is equally
ancillary."

Opening Up the Markets

Because of the Internet's global reach, wherever on earth wideband
Internet to the home happens, it's simultaneously an opportunity
for broadcasters anywhere and a threat to broadcasters in that
locality.

For example, hundreds of thousands of homes throughout California's
Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay area now have Internet
connections at least over 128 kbps ISDN.

Millions more are wired at 28.8 kbps or lower. According to media
buyers in the area, up to 20 per cent of the prime time TV audience
in the area - probably the most extensively computer-literate
region on earth - is lost to computer network usage on any given
night. Local TV advertising consequences are inevitable, even as
such new networking concerns as WebTV, C/net and @home base their
business plans on supplying Internet services with increasing
amounts of video to the "lost" TV audience.

Yet there are naysayers to the combined digital TV decoder/network
computer. Divicom, the MPEG specialist that is a subsidiary of
leading MPEG and JPEG chip-maker C-Cube Microsystems, has just
signed a contract to supply technology for Zenith Electronics' US$1
billion contract to supply digital set-tops to the Ameritech
consortium of US telephone companies.

The new decoders are to work on several digital video standards so
consumers can switch from the hybrid fibre coax (HFC) standard used
by American cable operators to the switched digital video (SDV)
used by telcos, to MMDS or DTH standards, too.

No Reasonable Price

There will not be room left in such a box to provide the Ethernet
node used for high-speed modems and the network computer, too - at
least not at a reasonable price.

"Advanced digital video delivery systems and services are difficult
to build and implement," says Divicom president/CEO Nolan Daines.

He emphasises a need to, "Minimise the complexity and reduce the
costs associated with implementing such systems, . . . and bring a
complete solution to the market in a fraction of the time."

Meanwhile, Microsoft's Bill Gates lambastes the idea of the network
computer. "If people really want underpowered PC's without hard
drives, why can't you even give away most used computers? It's a
fallacy," he said in a recent speech.

Yet Microsoft, too, has embraced the NC, especially for the home TV
monitor as display. It is backing the Florida start-up, Citrix, in
developing software for "thin client" client/server systems
compatible with Active X (formerly known as OLE).

This is to be the fulfilment of the model Microsoft bruited about
the cable industry a couple of years ago for interactive TV, then
called "Tiger." It is also meant to support home office workers on
NCs. The concept has been embraced, too, by several market-share
leaders in PCs, including the top company, Compaq.

By coincidence, however, this journalist just purchased his first
new desktop computer in five years, a Compaq, and was pleased to
obtain, for some US$500 less than his last Compaq four years ago,
not only a hugely faster processor but 80 times as much hard drive,
four times as much RAM, MPEG video, TV tuner, 8x CD-ROM drive, some
600Mb of software and all other usual bells and whistles.

A journalist does not need all of this stuff for work, but it does
allow a journalist to access all manner of graphical Internet
sites, and allow a journalist's family to learn from hybrid CD-ROMs
combining with Internet sites to supply video-like services with
interactivity.

The fat client competes with TV rather than augments it, and is
often preferable for those who can afford it (while becoming ever
easier to afford): my son has not watched television since the new
computer was delivered.

Merging Industries?

Clearly, Compaq places its bets on this kind of product as well as
NCs. So is Sony, which not only has just introduced its WebTV NC,
but also, just a few weeks before, its re-entry into the
traditional PC business.

Peter Dare, technology VP for Sony Business & Professional
Products, says, "When the PCs in Sony's booth at NAB outnumber the
VTRs, you know we should be selling PCs. These industries are
merging.

"There's going to be a continuum from PCs running home multimedia
to professional production systems on PCs, and we should be on both
sides of that."

In other words, just as Sony used its strength in home VCRs to help
it conquer professional recording.

Networked "Fat" Clients

The fully loaded PC (or "fat client,") poses other challenges and
opportunities for broadcasters. The challenges are mostly the same
as those offered by thin clients. But the fat client market seems
pretty clearly defined as likely to encompass just the top third of
most societies' demographic audiences (A and B demos, as TV
programmers put it), while home NCs, or thin clients, threaten
viewership at all but the least lucrative demos.

Fat clients may seem, on quick examination, to offer fewer
opportunities for broadcasters and more for equipment vendors. Not
many PC owners are likely to view TV entertainment at their
desktops; my son's TV-like usage of CD-ROM and Internet is not
benefiting any broadcaster.

But he is likely to graduate from his current diet of learn-to-read
games fairly quickly to learn- to-make-your-own-video devices;
Avid, Sony, Eastman Kodak, and others are now vying to supply him
with those devices.

The growth of the fat client business around the world will help
turn the home multimedia industry to the benefit of these TV
equipment makers, whose high-end nonlinear edit, digital recording,
and graphics creation software of just a few years ago now runs on
hardware within consumer budgets.

Even more than the large companies mentioned above, Radius, Fast
Electronic, DPS, Matrox, Autodesk, Adobe, and other smaller board
or software makers have predicated their business plans on bringing
broadcast post- production tools to home users.

What's Coming?

This strategy melds with a professional equipment strategy, too.
Says Pete Mountanos, marketing VP of Fast, "You don't know what's
coming in a year or two, but you know it's going to make your
$50,000 or $100,000 systems obsolete. So just buy a $1,000 board
from us and throw it out once you find something better."

One large software company is playing something of this strategy,
too. Microsoft has priced Softimage software at a third or less
than its 1995 levels, and expects to drive prices still lower, well
below its current US$10,000 to $20,000 level.

Softimage availability over Windows NT is a major factor in the
tremendous growth of Pentium Pro-based systems on the hardware
side. Dell Computer has just introduced a US$2,500 Pentium Pro
system running Windows NT, and capable of running Softimage. This
may be a very thin client compared to the Silicon Graphics systems
it may be used to emulate, but only a moderately fat client for the
average home PC buyer.

Buying Into Broadcasting

Combine it with a video camera and a very few thousand dollars
worth of Internet site creation and streaming software, and the
home PC becomes a small broadcasting station.

Surely it is significant that Microsoft has bought into
broadcasting, too, as half owner of MSNBC, a supplier of
programming to NBC's Asian networks and a 24-hour broadcaster in
the US.

The company wants its Microsoft Network online service and Internet
connection to mix and match ancillary and complementary programming
with MSNBC, and it is not shy about defining its programming as an
enabler for consumers' own programmes as well as for its own wholly
originated feeds.

For the traditional broadcasters, this is a new model which would
bear watching.

Of more long-term competitive effect for broadcasters, when
consumers get used to producing their own good-quality video, and
then distributing it on Internet sites as well as viewing video on
other 'net sites, they are likely to insist on demanding something
more from TV broadcasters than now available. What more? Only time
will tell.  '

PSN SHINES OVER THE ASIA-PACIFIC PT PASIFIK SATELIT NUSANTARA, ESTABLISHED
IN 1991 TO PROVIDE SATELLITE-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE
ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, CONTINUES TO FORGE AHEAD

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by Thomas King

Ever since all systems were declared "go" and Palapa A1 was
rocketed into orbit in July 1976 Indonesia has become a leader in
satellite telecoms.

With that giant leap forward 20 years ago the nation joined an
exclusive high technology 'club' as one of the first Third World
countries to use space technology.

The plan then was to effectively and efficiently link all parts of
the lengthy Indonesian archipelago with a modern telecommunications
network.

Not only would the network have to support telex, radio, television
and data transmissions and serve the nation's burgeoning number of
telephone users, it would also have to rely upon the then
revolutionary idea of using a tiny satellite in stationary orbit
some 36,000km above Indonesia.

The sparkle of the 250kg Palapa A1 was superseded in the mid 1980s
with the shimmer of the B2 series of spacecraft which became the
second generation platforms for a highly sophisticated
telecommunications network.

Several 550kg B2 satellites were progressively launched into
different orbits and after extensive testing proved their value as
distant repeater stations equipped with enhanced capabilities and
agendas.

With the introduction of the more sophisticated Palapa B series it
was decided that its various footprints should be intended for end
users in the vast ASEAN region, in addition to its prime service
market of Indonesia.

The Palapa B series launched reliable satellite communications to
hundreds of millions of people living in the then six member
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN):
Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand. (Vietnam has since joined the organisation, which
regularly meets to discuss regional matters, including telecoms
issues.

1991: Forging Ahead

Until 1991 Indonesia had but one private satellite service
provider, the company now known as Satelindo. PT Pasifik Satelit
Nusantara (PSN) was established in June 1991 with a mandate to
provide satellite-based products and services to the Asia-Pacific
region.

The five-year old publicly-owned company not only compliments the
satellite-based portfolio of Indonesian sister company, PT
Satelindo, but has successfully forged ahead with interests in a
number of telecoms enterprises.

For instance, just one year after its establishment PSN acquired
the 'retired' inclined orbit B1 satellite at 134 degrees E, renamed
it Palapa Pacific 1, and began operating services with an expanded
coverage over Asia from India in the West to Guam in the East.

The second satellite in the B2 series, the inclined orbit B2P came
under PSN management in early 1996. Renamed Palapa Pacific 2 and
relocated to 144 degrees E, PSN's ten standard C-band transponders
on this orbiting relay station are predominately leased by the
Mabuhay Philippines Satellite Corporation for telecommunications
and broadcast purposes.

Third Generation Satellites

PSN is also actively involved in Indonesia's third generation of
satellites, Palapa C1 and C2, which were launched in January and
May 1996, respectively.

A number of innovations and advances were incorporated into the
high power C series which, like the B series, was built by the
Hughes Space and Communications Company of California.

For instance, each 1740kg, 21m long Palapa C has more powerful
transmitters and highly refined antennas. Satellite life for the C
series is estimated at 14 years, virtually double that of the B
series.

"Through a joint purchase agreement with PT Satelindo, PSN owns and
operates 12 extended C-band transponders, six on each of two Hughes
HS601 Palapa C series satellites," said Ron Pirolo, Manager-Sales &
CS, Pasifik Satelit Nusantara.

Palapa C2: More TV Traffic

The C1, at 150.5 degrees E, is primarily used to carry rural
telephony on PSN's burgeoning VSAT service. Positioned at 113
degrees E, C2 is dedicated to broadcasting needs. Pirolo estimates
that up to two million parabolic dish antennas are currently
pointed at this satellite, which is claimed to carry more TV
traffic - 30 major broadcasters - than any other satellite in the
region.

PSN's Palapa C customers include broadcasters such as NBC Asia,
Star TV, TVB Hong Kong and RCTI, the dominant broadcaster in
Indonesia.

Footprint flexibility is an advantage for users of PSN
transponders, noted Pirolo, as they can opt for either of Palapa C
coverage patterns, the Asean beam or the Asia beam. In combination
these span the distance from East Africa in the West to New Zealand
in the East.

More Transponders Soon

In a few months PSN will be able to offer additional transponders
to users on yet another satellite, the soon-to-be-launched Mabuhay
1, the first-ever Philippine satellite.

One of eight partners that make up the Mabuhay Philippines
Satellite Corporation, PSN currently owns two transponders with an
option to acquire an additional six.

Developed and built by Space Systems/Loral (SS/L) of  the US,
Mahubay 1 is scheduled for launch this December. It is expected to
become operational from 144 degrees E orbital position during the
first quarter of 1997. (This position will put Mabuhay 1 in a co-
location with PSN's Palapa Pacific 2 until the end of service life
for the Indonesian satellite.

Designed for a 12 year operational life, Mahubay 1, the largest
space craft in SS/L's FS1300 series, is equipped with 54 active
transponders in the C- and Ku-bands.

A total of 30 high power standard and extended C-band transponders
and orthogonally polarised antennas will provide coverage to the
Philippines, Eastern China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Indo-China, Japan,
Korea, India, Bangladesh and Hawaii.

On the Ku-band, Mabuhay 1 will operate with 24 medium power/12 high
power transponders to cover the Philippines, coastal China, Taiwan
and northern Vietnam.

While PSN executives are actively involved in this pioneering
project others are deployed elsewhere to direct additional company
interests.

There are currently three other components in PSN's evolving
portfolio of satellite-related services: teleport services,
satellite network services and planned mobile satellite services.

Uplinking in Batam

In early 1994 and within three months after being awarded its first
satellite uplink contract, PSN technicians had designed, installed
and commissioned an uplink facility on Batam Island, near
Singapore. This signalled the start of the first commercial,
digitally compressed TV service in Asia.

The Batam Teleport was expanded in late 1995 to accommodate
additional operational requirements for the Palapa C satellites.
The facility now provides satellite monitoring, uplink and downlink
services, digital compression and editing services as well as
limited studio capabilities.

PSN's Teleport customers include clients such as NBC Asia which
uses the Batam complex for the downlinking of its broadcast service
off PAS-2, processing and uplinking to C2.

In the satellite network services arena PSN has teamed with Titan
Information Services to offer a "very cost effective, satellite-
based communications network".

Incorporating DAMALink software and hardware which actively assigns
frequencies to maximise satellite bandwidth efficiency, the Xpress
connection system is said to reduce costs by enabling more users to
be simultaneously served by a narrower bandwidth segment.

Voice, data and facsimile transmissions can be processed by this
system, which uses extended C-band frequencies and 1.2m earth-based
VSAT terminals.

AceS by 1998

While Batam Teleport and Xpress Connection are fully operational,
PSN's Asia Cellular Satellite (AceS) System will only come on-line
in 1998.

Conceived as a satellite-based, mobile communication system
providing fully digital voice, data, fax, alerting and paging
services to hand-held telephones anywhere in Asia, the system will
be seamlessly integrated with cellular networks and public switched
networks.

Apart from supplying cellular-like mobile services, ACeS will have
the ability to deliver telecommunications services to the
innumerable underserved and unserved rural locations throughout
Asia. Ericsson will develop and manufacture the satellite/ cellular
switched phones.

The workhorses of the orbiting system, currently under construction
by  Lockheed Martin, are the 2600kg A2100 AX spacecraft buses, said
to be the most powerful commercial communications satellites ever
built.

Dubbed 'Garuda' and sporting 12m long antennas and on-board digital
signal processing both of the 12 year service life satellites in
the ACeS system will have 140 spot beams focussed in Asia. The
footprints will cover in excess of 25 countries where a total
population of approximately three billion people live.

Each of the L-band satellites is designed to provide 11,000
simultaneous telephone channels and be capable of supporting up to
two million subscribers.

The Satellite Control Facility on Batam will contain the hardware
including a 15.5m tracking antenna, software and support facilities
necessary to manage and monitor the two massive Garuda satellites
of the heart of this revolutionary mobile communications system.

Towards 1999

In mid-October PSN announced plans to operate a multimedia
satellite by 1999.

Currently under constructionby the Lorel Corporation, the four-
tonne US$300 million satellite, to be called Palapa Pacific 3 and
positioned at 134 degrees E, "will not have any transponders,
although its capacity will be equivalent to that of a satellite
with 84 transponders.

The satellite is expected to be sent aloft in late 1998 or early
1999.  '

CHARISMATIC DIGITAL VIDEO EDITING: MARTYN GREEN TALKS TO QUESTECH'S GRAEME
FENEMORE AND ROBERT BILLING ABOUT THE CHARISMA X DVE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Situated in Wokingham, Berks, the heart of Britain's Silicon
Valley, Questech are the makers of such AV products as rate
converters, high quality decoders, and frame store synchronisers,
along with a solid-state video RAM recorder, and a solid-state
audio recorder.

But perhaps more than anything, it is known for its flagship
product, the Charisma X (Ten), a dual-standard and dual-aspect
ratio digital video effects device which they claim, "has the
highest frame-based interpolation in the industry, rendering
digital video effects images in real time".

According to Questech's sales support manager, Graeme Fenemore, the
Charisma X has been Questech's main product for the past year - and
by now Questech has sold, "a fair number" of them.

The basic model comes with an input and output mixer and a linear
DVE with three axis rotations. The input mixer comes as standard,
along with RGB colour correction, de-focus, luminance-chrominance,
and key.

Prices start off at about 37,000 (US$55,500) for the basic model,
up to 56,000  (US$84,000) for a single-channel device, although up
to three channels can be controlled from the same system.

Having three channels allows a display of three different video
sources on screen. "If you look at the news on TV," he explains
"sometimes they have two presenters, in different locations, in
different boxes on-screen - and that is two channels of DVE.

"We offer a third one also - all mixed over a background which can
be live."

The basic, linear model, has infinite expansion, and to this wrap
and warp effects can be added to do page turns and page rolls, or
oil drop ripple effects. "But it is all a 2-D image," explains
Fenemore.

"It appears as 3-D with the picture flat to the screen, but if you
rotate the picture around in 3-D space, it will appear as a flat
image.

"That also allows infinite expansion, because it is just an
additional board that is added to the system.

"If you want 3-D effects, where you have page turns, you can rotate
the image around in space and it will remain three-dimensional."

An extra board can be fitted to the entry-level CLEO, to allow
expansion on a flat picture up to eight times and three times on
CLEO effects.

"CLEO stands for the Curved Line Effects option - the 3-D stuff,"
explains Fenemore. There is a 5,000 pound add-on card that can be
added to the system to make it a super-CLEO.

This allows expansion of shapes up to eight times. "It also allows
you to fragment the picture, roll it into a cylinder or a cone,"
says Fenemore, adding "all real-time manipulation, as there is no
rendering involved with the Charisma system."

Saving Time In Rendering

He points out, "Unless you spend half a million pounds, with a lot
of the computer-based systems, you tend to find you have to set one
key frame, generate another key frame, and then let the system
render, going from one to the other on a frame-by-frame basis,
which does take time.

"But with the Charisma X, for instance you can set a key frame,
turn it into a sphere, and then rotate it around in 3-D space and
it remains 3-D.

"Or you can position it somewhere else, set a second key frame, and
when you run it, it will evolve from one shape to the other.
Normally on a computer-based system, you find it has to render
frame by frame.

"A lot of this stuff is done in hardware - it is not from
programmes that have been written to generate them, although
obviously there is software that is written to control the
hardware."

Operating Live-On-Air

Computer-based systems do work out cheaper, Fenemore admits, as a
lot of them come with other packages, like graphics and character
generators, all packaged with digital video effects.

"So you can have a complete editing system in a box, whereas the
Charisma X has to link up with other manufacturer's devices like
mixers, edit controllers and character generators."

However, he points out, "Where you wouldn't want to use a computer-
based system is when you are operating live on-air. If you want to
fire off an effect, like moving a picture away into the background,
then you'd obviously want to use a dedicated piece of hardware for
that.

"With the computer-based systems, you can't separate the DVE - it
is all in a box. You wouldn't use a computer-based system to
manipulate a picture on the TV screen on a live broadcast.

"Computer-based systems are used in post-production houses, where
speed of operation is not the most important thing, although
obviously a customer is paying by the hour for the use of the
product."

Disk vs RAM

The advantage of computer-based systems though, he agrees, are that
one can add graphics to the video. "But a computer-based system
uses disk drives, whereas our system has no disks - all the images
are stored in RAM memory.

"You are manipulating one frame of information, that's all. There
is one frame, or a field, delay, because you may have a pixel in
the top left which has to appear on the bottom right. It is frame-
based processing, which means that when you expand the image, you
don't have the slight flicker you get with field-based processing."

The Charisma Ten system comes as an input-output mixer, with the
DVE inside. "To that you can add the wrap or warp type effects
which are 2-D in plane effects, or you can have the CLEO and have
3-D effects, where you can manipulate the picture - like doing
page-turns, making into a sphere or cylinder etc., and it remains
three-dimensional."

Available Options

Options that can be added to the system include the ability to drop
images into a target frame store - what Questech call multi-freeze.

Says Fenemore, "You can build up montages by dropping in
information. Or you can generate a drop shadow effect, and de-focus
it. You can leave trails, much like you see on some computer
cursors, and you can decay the trail away or leave it on the
screen.

"You can also add a chroma-key, and chroma-key the DVE onto another
input source, and manipulate the combined images on-screen."

The Charisma has been around as a digital box since 1985. And
Fenemore claims that companies who bought one then, are still using
them nowadays. The earlier model to the Charisma X was an eight-
bit, field-based device, while the Charisma X is ten-bit frame-
based.

The internal architecture of the DV goes up to 24 bits and is
digitally transparent, "- so that with a full-sized centre, you can
freeze the video, and actually feed its output back into its input,
unfreeze it, and the picture will remain on screen."

What is new with the Charisma Ten is the input mixer, along with
the chroma- key option and the wrap or warp effects. "And with the
wrap system, you can get real-time morphing," enthuses Fenemore,
"so you can distort a picture in real time."

"You can do a two-channel morph, from one shape to another and you
can see it happening in front of you by moving a grid around, to
change it on the output screen, and then instantly run it, with no
rendering involved."

Unfortunately, he says, users cannot have both the CLEO and the
wrap systems in the same unit, as they are totally different
address architecture. "But you can combine channels so you have one
channel with the CLEO, and another with the wrap, because you can
have up to three channels."

Asked what sort of customers go for each type of system, he says,
"You tend to find that the morphing effects being used by post
production houses, whereas the wrap and CLEO effects can be used in
either environment."

"The multi-channel combining, and Z-axis information which allows
you to manipulate one channel behind another, without having to do
a priority select, or intersect other channels, has been around
since the launch of the first Charisma in 1985."

And he maintains that whereas Quantel were the first to generate a
three-axis rotate system, which Ampex followed with a three-axis
video manipulator, there was still no ability to do three-axis
rotations, and Questech is still "really the only manufacturer that
makes a DVE that can do all of these sort things in 3-D, in real
time."

Switching Between Events

Robert Billing, senior design engineer at Questech, feels the
Charisma X is useful, "for any sort of programme where you need
transitions.

"With sports programmes, for instance, the Charisma X can be used
most effectively to switch between all the different events during
the day. And we are now able to do 525/60 NTSC as well as 625/50
PAL, so we are getting into the American-dominated section of the
market."

Billings continues, " I don't think it would be easy for anyone to
try to copy us. We have extensive patent protection . . . "
Questech thus believes it has the market virtually cornered. And,
currently at least, it is sitting pretty on it.  '

THE GREAT OUTDOORS BECKON: UNTIL YOU START BATTLING TO BRING THE STORIES
IN, YOU MAY NOT NEED MUCH MORE THAN THIS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by Neal Weinstock

Mobile facilities are starting to move across Asia, as audience
ratings begin to give a tangible edge to the immediacy of location
shooting. Advertisers are taking notice, too, which leads
broadcasters to add yet more outdoor broadcast (OB) vans to their
technology resources.

In cold countries, this is called a snowball effect; but the OB van
trend is rolling and gathering size largely in places that never
see snow. What's a mobile facility? At its least, it's simply a van
- even a car -  used to hold portable production equipment.

"Until you get into a situation where you're battling competitors
to bring stories in," says Rob Braun of Phoenix ENG, a small US OB
van specialist, "You don't need much more than that for news."

Sport, however, is a different arena. Yet another is fiction
production. Broadcasters with rights to sporting events in more
than one or two venues in a typical year, and producers of
entertainment programmes that might experience a ratings boost from
a bit of outside-the-studio scenery, have differing and immediate
needs in OB vans.

That is why mobile facilities are best designed to order and
crafted for each special need. That is why, as much as large system
integrating vendors such as Sony, BTS, and Harris seem to dominate
the business, well over 50 per cent of the world's mobile
facilities are built by small local vendors.

There tends to be as much individuality among properly designed OB
vans as between in-house studio facilities. The differences are not
merely a matter of budget.

Do you need (and can you get government permission for) a microwave
link to the studio? Are you rolling the OB van into or just outside
of large arenas, concert halls, or night clubs? Or are you using it
to navigate narrow streets, pedestrian districts, off-road
countryside?

Depending on what programme is being shot, the same location may
require a different sort of vehicle.

In this author's photogenic and news-generating neighbourhood, we
are continually visited by every sort of mobile production. The
differences and similarities are highly instructive.

Frequent fiction film crews bring a dozen or more caravans (for
people only) and lorries (for equipment only), and no on-board
control room; all is set out in the open on the street.

The shoot costs millions, costs all of us locals our parking spots
and makes us occasionally wait to get in or out of our houses while
we gawk at actors, but the vans cost little; they are unimproved
trucks and mobile homes.

There are always local TV news vans around, their corkscrew-shaped
microwave antennae raised up to 30m to transmit video from the
squares in front of courthouses and government offices (or
sometimes from a waterside location for a weather report) to
studios.

Usually these are vans about four or five metres long, with room
inside for an AB roll editing system, driver, cameraman, editor,
and journalist, a portable light kit, a couple of camcorders, tape
and accessories, and a football field's length of cables.

Added on to the cost of a normal delivery van are an improved
electrical system, built-in microwave, countertops and cabinets,
and endless coffee spills.

Foreign TV correspondents based here are frequently out shooting
video in the neighbourhood, too. Typically, they stand in front of
a vista that tells the world where they are and deliver monologues
that may have been written without ever coming here.

Or they stand on the street interviewing celebrities from their
homeland who now live here, inadvertently demonstrating that no one
in my neighbourhood recognises them. For these applications,
unobtrusive politeness is needed in any OB van; usually, they use
station wagons well stuffed with camera, tripod, mini-lighting kit,
VTR, tape and accessories.

Lately, we are seeing more sport-utility vehicles used; they more
easily handle a bounce over a curb in the wilds of our
neighbourhood's pedestrian walkways, especially when heavily
loaded.

We have seen NHK crews with a hand-held microwave link stuffed into
the wagon, too; they can use it only in locations with a clear shot
at a receiver mounted high on an office building.

The inexperienced try to get away with packing only cameraman and
journalist in with all this; older hands include a driver, useful
mostly to guard against thieves and tow trucks.

TV commercials, fashion videos, and music videos are another
menagerie. Typically, all three travel in a four- or five-metre OB
van for video gear and online control, a caravan or two for talent,
and a big truck full of lights and often audio.

We know as soon as the truck doors open if the shoot is on film or
video: film shoots fill trucks with so many lights and generators
and reflectors and scrims and big gel filters that little else is
apparent, and they need no other van for video control. Video set-
ups can be pretty similar to TV news crews', with the addition of
roughly the same lighting gear as a film crew's. And no microwave,
of course.

For fashion and music video shoots, too, there's usually a full
complement of hi-fi audio gear; less often, performance sound
reinforcement gear. Though performers in music videos usually lip-
sync sound tracks in the studio to mimed singing on location, they
need loud enough audio to dance to.

Models in fashion shoots, likewise, need loud enough audio to walk
to. Actors in commercials may need this, too. Or they may need no
more audio than a wireless body microphone.

Given the diversity of needs and the relative infrequency of work
for all participants (compared, say, to TV news), these
applications almost always are serviced by rented vehicles; an
extra reason to keep the OB video control van separate from the
lighting equipment truck.

Crews that tend to be unfamiliar with equipment resources need
more, and more clearly defined, space to work with.

Location Shoots For Concerts

Then there are the location shoots for music concerts. MTV had an
all-star concert in the park where I like to run a few weeks ago.
Small crews from a non-profit channel sometimes come to shoot
chamber music concerts in a little hall just next to that park.

The two shoots' OB van needs could hardly be more different and yet
alike in concept. Both require trucks holding fully equipped
control rooms for multicamera shoots. The trucks must be parked
some distance from the stage, in both cases, so that the director
sees talent only over video.

In the case of the chamber music hall, a five-metre OB van sits in
a nearby parking lot and runs cables to a three-camera set-up in
the hall. Within the single OB van are stored precisely all the
lights, camera, and other portable gear needed for the shoot.

Since the crew comes here with some frequency, they know just what
they need and are able to transport most of it in a van that also
holds the three-camera control set-up, switcher, VTR, et al. Some
additional gear they are able to store in a closet in the little
hall.

In the case of the rock concert, two huge tractor-trailers,
accompanied by several vehicles for performers' dressing rooms,
filled a cobbled no- parking zone.

As many as a dozen cameras were used, necessitating a huge control
room that filled one of the trailers, taking up more space than
most control rooms in permanent, indoor facilities.

Of course, the trailer is a permanent facility, too, used for
sporting events if not rock concerts, and costing many millions of
dollars. The second huge trailer, filled with generators for
lights, stood farther from the stage to minimise the generators'
noise.

Other lorries that had brought other gear probably were parked far
away during the show. For days before and after, running through
the park was a challenging obstacle course. If most of these OB van
applications have not been seen in your neighbourhood, rest assured
that many soon will be.

"Anybody would rather watch anything that comes from outside the
studio," says Moses Znaimer, founder and chairman of Toronto's City
TV. "There's always the slightest possibility for surprise, for
some kind of life sneaking into the bleak, pre- programmed dead
zone of television."

City TV was a little independent upstart broadcaster a decade ago;
it made its mark against the established stations (and saved vast
costs) by not having any studios at all. Everything it did was
location work, even within its own offices.

The company now sells its expertise to other broadcasters, to help
others work the same formula. But nugget of City TV's strategy is
not patentable and inescapable: many viewers would rather see OB
video than studio video. As more and more competition comes to
Asian TV, the great outdoors beckon.  '

THE REALITY OF VIRTUAL STUDIOS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Virtual Set technology at IBC 96 did not have quite the 'must see'
quality it certainly had when the first blue screen sets startled
visitors back in 1994 - but there have certainly been some advances
this year which go some way to solving some of the complex
technical problems of virtual production.

There are buyers around - and at least one manufacturer confidently
claims 1997 will be the year of the virtual set - but didn't
someone say that about 1996?

There also has not been quite the shake-out of virtual set
companies yet, although Electrogig has vanished from the pantheon
of names, Its Reality Tracking technology has been acquired by
Triavest, a new company set up by former Electrogig chief executive
Mike Dilworth, and largely staffed by ex-Electrogig virtual set
specialists.

Triavest plans to spend far more time building the specific
requirements of its customers into the virtual set systems it
delivers - more of a custom-made approach. It was acknowledged last
year that there were too many companies chasing a fairly small
market - since that market was limited by the high cost of entry.

Now the market is being segmented into high and lower cost systems;
broadly the split between a 2D virtual studio without a tracking
camera, with pre-rendered sets manipulated by a high resolution
DVE; and the full 3D real time rendered virtual set, which in most
cases still requires a Silicon Graphics Onyx supercomputer - now
available with the Infinite Reality graphics engine which is some
ten times faster than SGI's previous model, the Reality Engine 2.

It was notable that Discreet Logic did not have a virtual set
display at IBC. It made great play of its Vapour, Frost and Glass
product lines at NAB this year, but following DL's re-structuring,
the IBC focus was on editing with Fire, and mid-price effects and
compositing with the Flint RT (for real time), helped by DL's first
hardware product, the Pebbles fast video i/o device.

However, Discreet says the absence of a Vapour demo does not imply
any less commitment towards virtual sets. It's still an important
part of its strategy for broadcast products, according to
Discreet's director of product marketing Marc Nadeau.

"Vapour and Frost are a key part of our development into production
for broadcast and we're currently transitioning the technology
research from Innsbruck to Montreal as part of the re-structuring.

"We just didn't have enough time to organise a blue screen
demonstration at IBC, but we showed the software and rendering
environment - and this year we've had 1500 hours on air generated
by Vapour, including the Eurovision Song Contest and 22 hours a day
from the Olympics for Canal Plus."

RT-SET has just signed a deal with SZM Sendezentrum Munchen for
three licences for its top end virtual studio system Larus, which
makes SZM the biggest user of virtual set technology yet, according
to RT-SET president and CEO Shalom Nachshon.

SZM acts as a production centre for four TV stations in Germany -
Pro7, the DSF sports channel, Home Order Television and the Kabel 1
movies and entertainment channel. SZM will be using three studio
cameras and a crane camera in its virtual studio facility.

"We've turned concepts into real production tools this year, and
proved it with productions like CBS TV's Tales of the Crypt, where
we did 26 episodes of the show in eight days," he says.

This involved RT-SET virtual sets mixed in with live action and
ainimation for a part of this children's show from the Samuel
Goldwyn Company called Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House.

"We've completed the development of centralising the entire
function of virtual set control room into one point - the virtual
studio operator - so the switching of cameras, controlling VTRs,
lighting, sound are all controlled by one guy who controls the
show," says Nachshon.

RT-SET has also completed development of software to generate
shadows from the talent and cast them not only on the floor, but on
virtual objects too, according to Nachshon.

"We don't have to use any blue boxes for this, and the cameras can
move too," he says. RT-SET has also devised a 3D prompter as
guidance for the talent, so they can watch where they are supposed
to move without the use of a monitor.

Orad Hi-Tec Systems has continued to export its technology to other
virtual set companies. Several now offer Orad's pattern recognition
system as an alternative to using memory head sensors in deriving
the co-ordinates to generate the right perspectives for the
computer graphics backgrounds.

Accom, Digimedia and Discreet Logic have all agreed with Orad to
interface its camera tracking system with their virtual set
systems. Orad now has a range of its Cyberset virtual set systems
at different price points, some entirely in-house systems, some
with partners like FOR-A, Vinten and Evans and Sutherland, which
offers a Windows NT based system.

"When we started developing a virtual studio system, we began using
a sensor-based system, but got so frustrated with it, we looked at
other methods and developed pattern recognition, where the camera
parameters are extracted from the video itself, not from any
associated mechanical devices.

"It means you can use ordinary studio cameras, you can dolly them
freely and even use shoulder mounted cameras or a Steadicam. And
since our video processor is located downstream of the switcher,
one system can service any number of cameras and there are no
calibration procedures required for them," says Orad's technical
director Dr Miky Tamir.

At IBC, Orad showed the use of virtual actors, integrating virtual
characters animated with motion capture in real time, which was
integrated into the virtual set system using the same Onyx CPU that
performs the set rendering.

The company also showed virtual presence, which means a person
recorded in a remote location can be immersed into the virtual set
as a 3D object.

Orad has also developed a feedback mechanism for the talent, which
renders the virtual world from above, calculating the footprint of
all virtual objects in real time and projecting them, tying them in
with the script and projecting them on to the studio floor.

Tracking the Camera

One of the drawbacks of virtual set technology is the high cost of
real time rendered 3-D systems, but the 2-D systems are attracting
some interest, including the BBC-developed DVE at the heart of the
Virtual Scenario system which is sold by Radamec.

Radamec showed the system at IBC with two Scenario units controlled
from a single camera channel, which adds flexibility to the system
enabling both inlays with virtual sets as well as animated graphics
which can interact with the presenter.

Radamec has sold the Scenaria system to ITN and BBC TV Centre. ITN
will be using it for a special project for the General Election,
while BBC TV has begun using the Scenaria on its first mainstream
programme to use a virtual set - Football Focus -  on Saturdays.

The main difference in use of the 2-D system as opposed to 3-D
systems is it cannot handle tracking of the camera, although it
does allow the camera to be panned, tilted, zoomed and focussed on
any virtual background.

The system can also be used as a direct replacement for back
projection and video wall systems. Asia Business News has also
bought a Scenaria system, which will be installed in December with
advanced robotic control and a touch control panel.

There are now other systems on the market which do not need a
supercomputer. FOR-A showed its digiWarp system at IBC, which
combines its own MF 3300 DVE with a video processor it has
developed, called a dimensioning processor which gives 2k x 2k
resolution in the DVE.

This works with the Orad Cyberset video processor to offer a system
using pattern recognition that can offer another two levels of live
images as well as the chroma key signals, and it will handle a
moving camera.

Photron showed its Pseudio virtual studio system, which is based
around the Primatte Pro 100 chromakeying device Photron developed
from technology used by its parent company, the Japanese post
production house Imagica.

Pseudio uses pre-modelling and pre rendering of virtual
backgrounds, which are stored in a disk array. The prerecorded D1
quality images are played back in real time, reflecting the camera
moves fed in by a camera head and tripod system that reads the
information on pan,titl and zoom positions of the foreground image
shot by the video camera.

The Primatte chromakeyer is used to composite foreground and
background images. There are four basic configurations of the
Pseudio system, from a 2D system with single camera configuration
using just a frame buffer, to one with the disk array and versions
using a single camera on rail and dolly, which feeds into two disk
arrays, and a system that combines all the options.  '

NONLINEAR ONLINE REACHES PINNACLE: YOUR GUIDE TO IBC NONLINEAR VIDEO
EDITORS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

by David Fox

There are now at least 77 manufacturers offering nonlinear editing
systems, according to Pinnacle's vice president for Europe, Brian
Conner, who claims 74 of them use Pinnacle DVEs within their
packages.

In reality, there are five key nonlinear manufacturers: Avid, D-
Vision, Media 100, Scitex and Lightworks. Quantel's Editbox is also
a serious player, but for high-end use (as is Discreet Logic's
Fire), while most of the traditional edit controller manufacturers
have gone for hybrid (tape and disk) systems, to protect their (and
their customers') investment in existing kit.

It does, however, mean broadcasters have a lot of choice. There is
a system to suit all needs and all price brackets, whether you want
to upgrade in one fell swoop, or merely add nonlinear capabilities
to your existing suites.

With the price of storage dropping so quickly, and its speed
increasing, online nonlinear editing is attainable for all but the
very lowest budgets.

There are still doubts about compatibility of formats and
compression systems, but even here the move towards more open
systems and standard compression formats means that your investment
should be a lot safer.

Scitex claims to offer the broadest range of nonlinear editing
systems on the market (although Avid, Media 100 and D-Vision might
disagree). Every function operates under the "real time, all the
time" banner. The whole Sphere range, launched in PAL at IBC,
offers Dveous effects and mixing technology based on the Abekas
8150 switcher, including keying, wipe generation, and colour
correction.

All effects are key-frameable. The compression rates are better
than 3:1, with variable image resolution, using Apple's Quicktime
file format.

The Sphere line has moved to using Motion JPEG, from the Cube's
wavelet compression.

Avid, which has sold 5,100 editing systems in Europe, showed
version 6.5 of the Media Composer at IBC.

It introduces a new picture resolution (AVR 77) at 2:1 compression.
It also allows live voice over recording, the linking of script to
pictures, eight channel audio, real-time effects, serial digital
i/o and various open system enhancements.

Newscutter's image quality is claimed to have been improved by 60
per cent. It can now also access the AvidNews database, so that
operators can look at scripts or playlists. Other features include:
drag and drop clip management, multiple levels of undo/redo and
title tool templates.

But probably the most impressive debut was MCXpress 1.5 (for Mac
and Windows NT). It is aimed at industrial and corporate use, but
is certainly powerful enough for many broadcast users.

It can create real-time wipes, dissolves and effects at 3:1
compression (the machine can go as low as 2:1) and Pinnacle's
Geniefusion card can be added for real-time 3D effects. It has a
fully integrated film matchback option for negative cut list
generation and the user interface has been simplified.

Vincent and Theo

Media 100 has a new logo and a lot of new, improved editing
products. Its base system, the 100qx, runs under the Adobe Premiere
package. Next up is the new 100le, which delivers real-time video
and audio editing and effects for about 7,500(US$11510).

At the top of the range, the 100xs has been brought in to aim for
high-end production, above the 100 2.6. Gaudi, an optimised version
of Pinnacle's 3D DVE, has also been introduced.

Further developments include the introduction of the Vincent 601
Digital Video Engine and the Theo Superprocessor 'brotherboard',
which it claims make up the first PC-based digital video system
fully compliant with CCIR 601. Features include two video streams
and a real-time alpha channel. They will boost the speed of editing
and effects under Media 100 software.

Media 100 is committed to using Quicktime as its core technology
for all its products for both the Mac and Windows, and is now
working with Apple, Macromedia and Truevision to develop Quicktime
for Windows 95 and NT.

Since Tektronix bought Lightworks, it was expected it would
integrate its disk recorders and Grass Valley effects with the
editing system. Now it has. The Lightworks VIP 4500 is based on the
Profile hard disk recorder and offers four independent video
channels, and Grass Valley DVE technology, for under US$150,000. It
features variable 3:1 compression, 16 channels of audio, between 32
and 96Gb storage (80 to 240 minutes), and Pal/NTSC switchable
software, both of which can be used in 24-frame film mode.

It has a built-in real-time mix/effects board, external device
control, multi-camera editing capability (as on Heavyworks) and can
digitise direct to edit without pre-digitising (as Newsworks).

Newsworks Turbo editing system was also launched at IBC, boasting
Beta SP picture quality at 4:1 compression. It is targeted as a
lower-cost stand-alone replacement for existing tape-based linear
suites and as part of a large-scale automated and networked
newsroom system.

It supports mixed compression rates within the same project or
edit, and can access up to 90Gb in a standard unit, expandable
externally to 180Gb, and eight digital audio channels, also
expandable. It can also control a channel of Profile.

Adcom's Night Suite is a nonlinear D1 and offline editor running
under Windows 95, with up to 2:1 compression, although the dual
channel effects have to be rendered at 4:1 or better. It comes with
a 27Gb drive which gives up to 15 minutes at 2:1 or 2.5 hours at
5:1.

Its audio features are a strong point as an eight channel, 16-bit,
Sadie audio editor is built-in, and its control panel has motorised
faders. Its basic effects include more than 200 wipes, chroma,
alpha and luma keyers.

The Inscriber character generator is included, along with a 2-D DVE
and an optional integrated Aladdin 3-D DVE. The graphical interface
seems nicely designed and clearly laid out and the most used
functions are one button push away on the control panel, as are 24
user definable softkeys.

It has a "soft delete" feature which will remove a shot, or shots,
from playback, but leave them in the timeline, which is useful for
trying different options. It costs about US$58,000, plus options
which include more storage and serial digital i/o.

Waving, Not Drowning

The Philips BTS Newswave has a dedicated control console for high
speed news cutting. Based on Media Pool, it can be uncompressed or
compressed, has a single video channel, and four independent audio
tracks, and a picture-based timeline.

It can be stand alone or networked, with up to 16 workstations
working on the same material at one time, and should be available
next year for about US$20,000 for a server and workstation, plus
Media Pool.

Newswave is cuts only as Media Pool cannot yet handle effects,
although that facility will be added. There is also Wavelite for
loading and logging material, although both applications can run on
the same machine.

Adobe's editing package is Premiere (for the Mac and PC), which can
edit up to 99 video and 99 audio tracks, at a cost of about
400(US$614), for the software only. It is claimed to be highly
customisable, with a wide range of transition effects (wipes,
etc.).

It can also create titles, with crawls and other motion controls
(or import titles from Adobe Illustrator). Its audio effects are
more basic (although still include limited time stretching), but
all the Adobe products benefit from being able to work with plug-in
software modules, which add audio filters or visual effects.
Depending on the hardware it is run on, it can be used as an on-
line editor, or will generate various EDL formats for use off-line.

For more high-end applications, Adobe also has After Effects, a
resolution independent effects package for the Mac, and coming for
Windows NT. Indeed, after years of supporting the Mac platform,
with some products also running on SGI, Adobe has embraced the
Windows PC, thanks to the arrival of Windows NT, which has added
performance and stability to the PC's normal main attraction of low
price.

Quantel's Editbox '96, launched at IBC, is a range of four systems,
costing from about 120,000 (US$184,200), for short or long-form
editing for top-end broadcast and commercials production.
Improvements include faster keying, moves and colour correction.

More editing and paint facilities are built in, and Quantel's Open
Platform Exchange Network (OPEN) is supported, allowing editors
access material on other Quantel systems and from other platforms.
Existing Editboxes, of which more than 250 have been sold, can be
upgraded to Editbox '96.

The New Entrants

Pixel Power's Collage EDit is a non-compressed nonlinear editor
which integrates with existing Collage CG systems (which can be
upgraded for about 45,000, or US$69,100). A complete package,
including CG, costs about 70,000(US$107,450).

Basic storage is 35 minutes, which can be expanded for about
500(US$767) per minute, and compression can be added if users
want. The interface is less graphical than some rivals, but is
reasonably simple.

Clips have to be pre-digitised before editing, but Pixel Power may
bring out a lower cost digitising workstation. The machine was a
crowd-puller at its IBC launch IBC, and picked up eight orders in
the first two days. Deliveries start in December.

ASC's VR NLE is being updated to run under Window's NT. The company
admits its existing DOS version (costing from US$25,000) has not
taken off, partly because of the lack of real-time effects.

The new version, will rectify that and add keying, titling
character generation and Pinnacle Aladdin 3D effects. It will be
based on ASC's VR 300 high quality disk recorder.

As the company has a lot of video servers installed, it will
probably also bring out a news editing system to run on them.  '

MAKING CONTACT WITH INDIA

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

The world's second largest (behind China) and least tapped middle
class. India's increasingly affluent middle-income group currently
numbers nearly 250 million people, many of them with at least two
sources of disposable household income, and all looking for a
better quality of life.

The booming economy and the fast pace of development, combined with
a thirst for modernisation and technological expertise, have opened
up India's broadcasting and telecommunications markets as never
before.

Latest estimates show that radio reaches as much as 94 per cent of
the 950 million strong population, the bulk of it living in rural
areas which would be difficult for any other medium to reach.

Television now reaches as much as 84 per cent of the population.
It is axiomatic that, with the kind of headstart that the state-run
terrestrial broadcaster Doordarshan (DD) had, and the effective
monopoly it enjoyed until the start of the 1990s, its national
network and Metro channels (which reach the four metropolitan
centres) should have the maximum reach.

However, Zee TV, which is uplinked via satellite from Hong Kong, is
fast catching up; and there is vigorous competition from a host of
other channels. In comparison with 42 million homes that have DD,
there are 13 million homes today that boast cable and satellite;
and it is this latter segment which is showing signs of growing at
a much faster rate than the former. Official estimates place the
number of cable and satellite homes at 53 million by the year 2005.

TV stations cannot run without adequate software back-up; and
hundreds of companies that offer programming, production and post-
production services have mushroomed in the country over the last
five years, all on the lookout for new technology, both at the
production and post-production stages.

325 Companies Expected

Little wonder, then that some 325 companies are expected to
participate in Broadcast, Cable and Satellite India '96 (BCSI),
India's largest annual broadcast exhibition, which will run
concurrently with Communications India '96 at the Pragati Maidan,
New Delhi, from December 8 to 11.

"We had wonderful response last year for BCSI '95, with our
exhibition and conference providing an ideal forum for the
convergence of broadcasting, cable, satellite, communications and
multimedia packages," enthuses Prem Behl, president of Exhibitions
India, organisers of the event.

"That exhibition, which was the third in the series, paved the way
for several new joint ventures in these sectors, and provided the
ideal opportunity for Indian professionals to discern technological
advancements and gauge the latest market trends.

"The majority of the 121 exhibitors we had were pleased with the
outcome of business at the event, and 62 per cent confirmed their
participation in the following year's event, on the spot!"

Founded in 1987 to promote and organise international trade shows,
exhibitions and conferences, the organisers do much homework before
each event. Adds Behl, "We are not involved in trade, and therefore
have no conflict of interest with our exhibitors.

"In fact, we are a catalyst within the industry that we service,
bringing buyers and sellers together . . . we supplement our
exhibitors in the market by arranging and making it possible for
them to meet qualified, targeted buyers in a cost-effective way."

Catalyst to Contacts

The organisers remain in contact with leading international
associations, standards organisations, legislators, exhibitors,
manufacturers and service organisations worldwide, to facilitate
their participation at forthcoming events.

BCSI '96 is seen as India's official annual broadcast show, since
it is co-sponsored by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,
and has the official approval of the India Trade Promotion
Organisation and the ministries of Home Affairs and External
Affairs.

Whereas BCSI '95 ran in October (attracting 121 exhibitors from 14
countries, and 14,203 visitors), and Communications India '95 was
held in December (133 exhibitors from 17 countries, and 16,677
visitors), the two shows have been combined this year to give
exhibitors and visitors the opportunity of witnessing complementary
advances in both fields.

Also running between December 8 and 11 at the same venue will be
Pro-Audio India '96, Lighting India '96, TV India '96, Networks
India '96 and Wireless India '96.

The stalls will be spread over a massive area of 7,000 sq. m on
Pragati Maidan, and are expected to attract 325 exhibitors and more
than 27,000 trade visitors from 30 countries.

In the broadcasting arena, professional camera, lighting, sound,
movie and video production and post-production products, cable and
satellite broadcast systems will all be on display.

Telecommunications product manufacturers will show off both voice
and data communications equipment and value-added services; local,
medium and wide area networks, and mobile systems including
cellular phones and pagers.

"Last year, a little over 50 per cent of the exhibitors were from
overseas," claims Behl. "This year, the ratio of overseas to
domestic exhibitors should be even higher. In addition, we expect
more than 2,000 attendees at the high-profile international
conferences covering all broadcast sectors and communications
technology and practices."

Conference: Digital Focus

The conference will focus on one of the industry's most challenging
issues - the transition to digital technology. It will focus on the
future of cable and telecom networks in India over the next few
years, and the expansion of production and post-production
facilities in the country.

Previous conferences have had delegates from India, the SAARC
countries, Africa, Australia, Europe and the US.

Says Behl, "While each exhibition makes headlines because of its
scope and focus, the conference components are just as important.

"It establishes the environment in which the industry will operate,
from both a technical and regulatory point of view, and defines the
intellectual grounds in which new applications, services or trends
are being utilised."

Visitor Profiles

The visitor profile is expected to include people from senior
levels of central and state governments, and from public and
private sector trade and industry. "We expect a cross-section of
people from all sectors - the government and administration, public
service organisations, the financial sector and management
executives," says Behl.

"In 1995, when we did an analysis of the visitor/buyer attendees,
we found that over 77 per cent visitors were the decision-makers of
their companies, who were involved in purchasing or recommending
the purchase of equipment or services."

Among the confirmed exhibitors at BCSI '96 are Panamsat, Intelsat,
PPC, Scientific Atlanta, General Instruments, Harmonic Lightwaves,
Dielectric Communications and Zenith Electronics (all US); Trans
Electric (Taiwan); Turner International, and Tektronix  (Hong
Kong), Technosat (Dubai); Federation of the Electronics Industry
(U.K), Belden International (Singapore); California Amplifier
(Thailand), EVS Broadcast Equipment (Belgium) and Deviser
Electronics (China).

Some of the prominent exhibitors from the host nation are C-Net
Communications, Prince Electronics, Miraj Marketing, Bhansali
Udyog, Network Limited and Real Image (who will demonstrate the
latest Avid media composer systems, audio-visual systems, airplay
systems, QFX sound effects organisers, media fusion systems,
digidesign session and proloops systems, etc).

"It is the ideal time of year to hold such an important exhibition,
since New Delhi will be cool and pleasant," asserts Behl.

"We are confident that it will be India's biggest show ever."  '

COURTING THE ASIAN BROADCASTER

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

The Asia-Pacific region now represents a key market for UK
manufacturers looking for untapped areas of growth. But what's in
it for the customers? Simon Croft reports

While the European hifi market is dominated by major Eastern brands
such as Sony and Pioneer, the Asian broadcast market frequently
adopts equipment made in the UK for audio production.

UK-based pro audio manufacturers including SSL and AMS Neve
increasingly regard the Asia-Pacific region as an important and
fertile area for new sales.

The evidence for this can be seen in the growing number of UK
manufacturers providing direct sales and support in Asian
countries.

New Sales Opportunities

The attraction for manufacturers is easy to understand. Major
brands which have achieved a large market share in North America
and Europe find it difficult to perpetually sustain the growth they
once enjoyed in these territories.

By contrast, the Asia Pacific broadcasting sector is undergoing
massive growth and continues to present new sales opportunities.

UK manufacturers can see that broadcasters in the Asia Pacific are
not only buying more equipment: they are also increasingly
demanding state-of-the-art systems to help them achieve a
competitive edge.

But it is by no means a one-sided situation. The UK has a very well
respected pro-audio manufacturing industry and Asian broadcasters
which invest in UK-built products today can be certain that the
solutions they buy into have been refined by a steady stream of
user feedback in the past.

SSL's Experience

Solid State Logic has been notably successful in the region and
recently opened an office in Singapore, which handles sales for a
number of countries as well as technical support for Asian
territories excluding Japan.

The manufacturer has for some years maintained an office in Japan
itself.

In addition, distributors in countries including Korea have been
gaining new contracts. Korean distributor Daiyoung Industrial
recently sold two SSL integrated digital multitrack recording,
editing and mixing systems. Facility Lead Sound opted for an
OmniMix for film and television post production, while HSTV, the
Home Shopping channel chose a Scenaria for its requirements.

Shanghai Radio, A-String in Taiwan and Avon in Hong Kong have all
taken analogue SL9000 series mixing systems. There have also been
recent sales to Synchrosound in Malaysia and Platinum Studios in
Taiwan

Market "Technique-driven"

SSL's Alan MacLeod believes that one of reasons top-end UK
manufacturers are successful in Asia is that the market is
'technique-driven'.

He explains, "When SSL brought out the B series consoles it
effectively enabled new ways of working.

"Hand in hand with the new capabilities of the system came
techniques that were not possible before. There is now global
acceptance of those techniques."

MacLeod also points out that while Asian manufacturers are ideally
geared up to mass production for the consumer market, "more than 90
per cent of the systems we produce are customised in some respect".

According to MacLeod, another factor driving sales of hi-end audio
equipment is a growing awareness that saleable programmes must have
high quality sound tracks.

"Programme makers are selling to broadcasters who may already be
transmitting in surround. As the uptake of domestic decoders
increases, high production values are increasingly essential," he
suggests.

While broadcasters look to overseas sales to maximise profits, and
independent programme-makers constantly seek to attract new buyers,
post-production facilities are constantly looking for a competitive
edge.

Performance: A Crucial Issue

"They want to offer good rates, the ability to meet deadlines
reliably and provide as much creative flexibility as possible,"
MacLeod notes.

He likens the situation to a race track: almost any car would
enable you to complete successive laps but if you want to win,
performance becomes a crucial issue.

KBS - Korea's largest radio and television broadcaster - recently
bought four new mixing consoles from AMS Neve. Two were high-end
Capricorn digital systems, while the other two desks were from the
well established and relatively inexpensive analogue 55 Series.

The KBS satellite television network covers South and North Korea,
Japan and the northern part of China. Two channels offer a range of
programming including sport, drama, documentaries and music.

David Lee of Korean distributor Seoul Sound Technology Group says,
"These sales are very significant for us. KBS is the main
broadcaster in the region and its purchasing decisions will
inevitable influence those of other facilities in Korea."

The two Capricorn consoles, which are being installed this month,
are to be used primarily for live broadcasting and music
production. They are going into KBS' Seoul-based satellite
television station, which was itself only launched in July this
year. Both are 48 fader systems.

The 32 fader 55 series consoles will be delivered in January next
year. They will be installed at KBS' radio station for use in live
music and talk shows.

Earlier this year, Measat Broadcast Services in Malaysia ordered
seven AMS Neve digital consoles for audio post production and
broadcasting.

Phase one of the broadcaster's plan saw the introduction of a 48
channel Capricorn digital desk for light entertainment production.

Also specified were four Logic 3 digital mixers with eight output
Audiofiles, all fitted with removable drives. Two of these were for
dubbing and the two for ADR.

Two Logic 2 digital mixing desks with eight output Audiofile
Spectras with removable drives are being commissioned for live
sound production. One stand-alone eight output Audiofile Spectra is
being used as well. All are fitted with 24-bit systems running
version 12 software.

AMS Neve has also received a repeat order from broadcaster NHK in
Tokyo. Its second large format Logic 2 digital mixing desk is being
used for audio posting in HDTV format programmes.

Like SSL, AMS Neve has a strong foothold in the music recording
sector. Recording studio Asahi Sound in Japan recently ordered its
third AMS Neve V series analogue console. The 60 channel VR Legend
has been installed in Studio 401.

In the case of large-scale consoles suitable for music recording,
the UK has undoubtedly been aided by its historical dominance of
the pop world and the product development that this has financed.

But by no means all UK manufacturers have a connection with the pop
music industry. Audio workstation manufacturer Digital Audio
Research is another UK company enjoying growing success in the
Asia-Pacific.

Towards the end of last year, the manufacturer supplied Malaysian
facilities house Addaudio Post Productions with a Soundstation Gold
integrated system. This gave Addaudio three DAR rooms in total.

At the time, studio manager Daniel Tang noted, "We have been using
DAR Soundstations since 1991 and are very happy with the overall
system approach, particularly in terms of Soundstation's
comprehensive editing facilities and ease of use."

Back For More

Now Addaudio is back for more, as DAR regional sales manager Alan
Campbell explains. "Addaudio have upgraded their two older systems
to Gold specification and have ordered two DAR Sabres this month."

Now a five DAR system facility, AddAudio will be using one of the
mouse-driven Sabres to create a lower cost post room and the other
as an eight track transfer room prior to projects entering one of
the fully equipped dubbing suites.

Elsewhere in Asia, DAR's Japanese distributor has sold systems to
broadcasters including JIC Satellite which opted for a Sabre Plus,
while major broadcasters including TBS have upgraded their existing
systems. Other users include national broadcaster NHK. "We have
done well in most of the major Asian countries, such as Korea,
Taiwan and Malaysia to a degree," says Campbell. "Japan and to a
lesser degree China have been successful for us. We see potential
in Indonesia.

"We are trying to boost the established markets and at the same
time keep up with the emergent markets such as Vietnam and
Cambodia, where they are starting to show real interest."

Working Developing Markets

In terms of developing markets, some products are easier to
introduce than others. Audio Processing Technology is a developer
of compression technologies, a major use for which is in the
distribution of audio via digital ISDN lines.

Although the company's main centres of operation are in the UK and
US, APT sales manager Asia Patrick Cullen is now permanently based
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

"Europe and America are our primary markets but Asia will become
increasingly important over the medium to long term, Cullen
predicts. "The technology we are offering, in terms of ISDN
solutions is still quite new.

"Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan are the more advanced countries but
elsewhere there is less knowledge of ISDN and there is a lot of
groundwork to do.

"In some senses we are having to sell the technology in advance of
the actual products."

Although Cullen estimates that around 95 per cent of broadcasters
in Japan using codecs are using APT technology, in other Asian
countries, there is still not the communications infrastructure to
support the digital technology APT offers.

"We have had our first sales in Taiwan and Korea and we are
involved in quite large projects in Thailand and Malaysia," Cullen
reports. "We are hoping that over the next two to three years we
can replicate the success we have had in Japan.

"It is important to break into new markets because broadcasters
like to know who else is using the equipment. They are reticent
about being the first."  '

MTV ANNOUCES EXPANSION PLANS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

MTV Networks Asia President Peter Jamieson today announced the next
phase in MTV's development in Asia, which are expected to take
place this year.

By the end of October, India will begin receiving its own MTV, a
third service seen only in the Indian subcontinent, while MTV
Mandarin moves its production base to Taipei.

To address MTV's growth in Southeast Asia, staff strength will be
increased with new hires, and all three channels will see the
addition of new programmes that reflect the social, cultural and
musical tastes of each region.

Singapore will remain the regional headquarters for MTV Networks
Asia. All channels will be post-produced and uplinked from
Singapore. The three channels will be referred to as MTV Asia, MTV
India and MTV Mandarin.

Apart from enjoying a new service specifically for them, Indian
viewers can look forward to new shows that will be produced in
India and Singapore, as well as a higher rotation of Indian music
videos, interviews and new features.

MTV India will be delivered to the Indian subcontinent on Panamsat
4, which up till the end of October delivers the MTV Asia feed
containing four hours of India-specific programming.

MTV Mandarin will move its production base from Singapore to
Taipei. The move beefs up the Taipei office with hiring new local
staff, and several of the channel's staff from Singapore, including
on-air personalities, will also be relocated to Taipei. The channel
will announce a roster of new shows in due course.

MTV Asia forges ahead with new programmes designed from Southeast
Asia, including new shows specific to Asean countries, plus
increased rotation of music videos from the region.

Recently, MTV Asia launched a new live music series called Live &
Loud, showcasing some of the best in upcoming Asian artists.

DOORDARSHAN TIGHTENS GRIP ON NDTV AND TV TODAY

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Doordarshan (DD) has issued notices to the owners of TV Today (part
of the India Today group) and New Delhi Television (NDTV),
informing them both that their current affairs programmes - Aaj Tak
(Until tonight) and News Tonight -  would not be televised on the
national network at prime time any longer.

Sources in the ministry for Information and Broadcasting (I&B) say
that, in all probability, News Tonight would be dropped altogether,
since the firm has entered into a tie-up with the Hong Kong based
Star TV network owned by Rupert Murdoch, to make similar
programmes.

The new schedule, which comes into effect on any day between
November 4 and 6, places both the current affairs programmes half
an hour later than their current slots. DD has also quadrupled the
telecast fees for both programmes, asking for payment much higher
than is being charged for tele-serials.

Both the private producers used to pay a fee of Rs35,000
(US$1,000), but this has now been increased sharply to Rs150,000
(US$4,225). And even this fee will suffer a review after six
months.

HP SERVER OFFERS MOST CHANNELS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Hewlett-Packard recently announced its support for clustered
networking of its broadcast servers, allowing up to 24 on-air
channels, the largest number of channels available in the broadcast
industry to date.

With the HP MediaStream Server - Broadcast Series as the core
building block, broadcasters can create truly scaleable systems -
from two to 24 channels - opening up new application areas for
digital server technology.

The HP MediaStream Server - Broadcast Series is the low-cost
building block of a multichannel system. It provides advanced
server capabilities - networking, a proven "bulletproof"
architecture, industry-standard MPEG-2 video compression and an
open platform for applications development - at prices starting at
US$100,000.

Because a single HP broadcast server offers up to six channels, it
is the ideal starting point for a multi-channel system.

With standard features such as RAID (redundant array of inexpensive
disks), redundant components and a multi-threaded operating system,
the HP clustered-server complex can offer complete redundancy
without the total mirroring of servers of the server complex
itself.

HP's use of MPEG compression also adds to the cost-effectiveness of
this multichannel solution. Because MPEG uses one-third less disk
space than Motion JPEG, storage costs are dramatically reduced.

This cost can be significant when considering the massive storage
needs of a multichannel facility or of a pay-per-view or NVOD
system. A key component of server clusters is the underlying
network used to connect multiple servers into a server complex.

HP has incorporated Fibre Channel networking into its servers for a
broadcast-studio environment. Fibre Channel is a very-high-speed
link capable of faster-than-real-time transfers.

It can be implemented in cost-effective "loop" configurations that
do not require the use of an expensive network switch.

MANILA'S PASI BUYS RUSSIAN SATELLITE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Philippine Agila Satellite, a government-backed consortium,
recently bought for US$9.5 million the country's first commercial
satellite from Russian space agency Intersputnik.

The satellite, Agila 1, is due to be operational by Nov 10, in time
for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting, which is
being hosted by the Philippines.

The purchase of the Russian satellite is an interim measure,
pending completion in early 1998 of two other broadcast and
telecoms satellites, being built by Aerospatiale of France.

PASI's interim satellite has already been in orbit for three years
and the company has effectively bough the last two years of its
operational life, Mr Panizales said.

PASI was hard-pressed to come up with a satellite
telecommunications service for the APEC ministers meeting, which
starts Nov 24.

HUM AAPKE HAIN KAUN IN MASSIVE FESTIVE DEAL WITH STAR TV

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

The Hindi feature film, Hum Aapke Hain Kaun? (What is my
relationship with you?) is to be shown on November 10, the main day
of the Hindu festival Deepavali, on Star TV.

The premiere on the small screen will net the movie's producers,
the Barjatya family of Rajshree Films, a record Rs50 million
(US$1.4 million).

The film, which is basically a family entertainer, holds the record
for the highest box-office collections, having grossed more than
Rs2.25 billion (US$64 million) during the three years that it has
run at various cinema houses in the country.

It stars current matinee idol Madhuri Dixit and Salman Khan in what
reviewers call a 'squeaky-clean' film. It is understood that Star
TV has forked over is Rs10 million, more than what Godrej Soaps had
to pay for sponsoring the Miss World beauty pageant in Bangalore in
November.

The deal, considered a major coup in the Hindi film industry, will
eclipse the trend set by another great Indian film Sholay (Embers),
which was recently screened by Doordarshan on a national holiday.

The screening, done through G. P Sippy Films, helped DD to pocket
around Rs25 million in ad revenues through the selling of 83 time
slots to various advertisers.

While Thai Sky and IBC Cable TV are busy scrambling their signals
to prevent illegal reception, newcomer UTV Cable Network is busy
carving out its own market niche.

The company's goal is to link over one million households per month
with optic fibre cables.

UTV president Sompan Charumilinda said the company will launch a
commercial titled UTV The  Always New TV.

At present, the market is controlled by Thai Sky and IBC with
subscription bases of about 50,000 and 150,000 respectively. UTV is
hoping for 100,000 subscribers by the year-end.

Sompan said from now until the end of the year, the firm is
offering subscribers a basic package of nine Pay TV channels at
Bt800(US$32) per month. The specialty channels include Channel V
Thailand, CMT (American Country Music), ABN and CNBC (World
Finance, Economics and Stock Market Report), CCTV and BBC News
World.

Asia Business News (ABN) recently purchased Radamec Broadcast
System's Virtual Scenario Studio System, becoming the first news
broadcaster in the Asia Pacific to use the virtual studio on a
full-time basis.

Virtual Scenario allows the camera to be panned, titled, zoomed and
focused on any virtual background, providing an alternative to
costly back-projection and video wall systems.

ABN's acquisition of the Virtual Scenario comes in the heels of
ABN's winning the Singapore National IT Award for Innovative IT
Product/ Service for its 3-D graphics.

The Virtual Studio expected to be fully operational by early 1997.

OVERWHELMING DEMAND REPORTED FOR ASTRO SERVICE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Most of Astro's first batch of 7,000 Digital Satellite Receivers
(DSRs) have been sold even before they reached the authorised
Philips dealers.

According to Paul Edwards, Astro's Chief Operating Officer, the
demand prior to the soft launch of Malaysia's new digital satellite
television and radio station on October 1, was overwhelming.

"We took nearly 3,000 calls last Thursday alone from interested
subscribers, and this is even before our advertising campaign
starts on October 12," he said.

The first subscribers are expected to have their sets installed
starting next week. Edwards said Astro will not be charging
subscribers during the month of October.

"October is a settling in period, and there will be some tuning of
the service. More shipments of the DSRs are on the way, but we
advise potential subscribers to reserve their DSRs now," he added.

Astro's Director of Information Systems, Andrew Lee, reported some
11,000 "hits" per day on the Astro Internet website. These included
both Malaysian and international users. The website can be accessed
at http:// www.astro.com.my.

"If there is any indication of interest, Astro has certainly caught
the imagination of the Malaysian public," said Lee.

DISCREET LOGIC NAMES RAMSAY AS NEW REGIONAL CHIEF

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Discreet Logic has announced the appointment of Peter Ramsay as
General Manager, Asia-Pacific.

Ramsay will be responsible for Discreet Logic operations in the
region including offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, India and Japan.

He joins the Discreet Logic Asia-Pacific team effective November 1,
1996 and will be based in Singapore.

Ramsay has worked in the broadcasting and video industry since 1981
and brings a wealth of management and technical experience from
companies including Tekniche, Dynatech and Chyron.

The post production market is maturing very quickly in Asia," said
Ramsay. "More and more customers are demanding the very highest
level of performance from both equipment and operators."

New Bombay Office

Discreet Logic recently extended its presence in the Asia-Pacific
region with a new office in Bombay that exclusively serves India.

This office will provide enhanced local support and training to the
increasing number of Discreet Logic clients in India.

Paresh Khara has been named Business Manager for the region, and
will manage a team of sales, systems integrators, demo artists and
support personnel, as well as close liaison with the regional
distributors.

Indian Market "Growing"

"The market in India has grown from a handful of PC-based post
houses primarily producing commercials and television programming,
to around 50 high-end facilities that are making major in-roads
into the film and music video industry," commented senior vice
president sales and marketing Graham Sharp.

ESPN PLAYS BALL WITH STAR SPORTS

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Sports satellite channel giants and arch-rivals ESPN and Star
Sports have turned into somewhat uncomfortable bed-fellows, in an
effort to trim losses and beat the enormous pressure created by
intense competition and lack of sufficient revenues in the Asian
market.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two rival
channels, which was signed in early-October, clarifies that the
tie-up is only for Asia. It envisages the setting up of a new joint
venture company by ESPN and Star, to be headed by Sandy Brown of
ESPN.

The Delhi-based Modi Entertainment Network (MEN), which manages the
programming for ESPN, will continue in the same capacity for the
new network. MEN has a three-year contract with ESPN, of which just
one year has elapsed.

The main reason for the synergies between the two groups is that
the bidding route for sports programmes had become so high that
even advertising revenues have failed to cover the costs.

By joining hands, the two groups can try and ensure that the
programmes on the sale block remain between them, and that the
bidding price is not pushed too high.

In another related development, Star TV announced the joining of
former Doordarshan director-general R. Basu as managing director of
its India operations. Basu will head News Television International,
Murdoch's holding company in India.

NEW MALAYSIAN BROADCASTING BILL TABLED

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

MALAYSIAN Information Minister Datuk Mohamed Rahmat recently tabled
a Bill calling for a jail term of up to three years for anyone
failing to obtain a licence for receiving foreign broadcasts.

He said that the change to the current provisions were necessary to
keep ahead with technology.

"These changes should not be left to occur with no specific
direction, but be directed towards the benefit of the people and
the country," he said when tabling the Bill to amend the
Broadcasting Act 1988 in the Lower House of Parliament.

He added that the amendments will enable the licencing and control
of new broadcasting services, following advances in satellite
technology.

Under the amended act, a licence will be required from the
Information Ministry in order to receive any foreign broadcast or
telecast directly, and to make any transmission from Malaysia.

Offenders could face a fine of up to M$100,000 (US$39,280), or a
jail term of up to three years, or both.

Under the bill, the Information Minister will have the right to
determine the size and form of transmission receivers, control the
type and supply of broadcast materials to places such as hotels,
and to give exemptions for such licences in the broadcast of
official functions or other non-profit oriented public services.

The bill also states that prior approval will be needed from the
Information Minister before the screening of any advertisement, and
failure to do so will constitute an offence. Those convicted could
be fined up to M$10,000 (US$3930), jailed for a year, or both.

The Bill also incorporates additional areas such as ships and
aircraft, which were previously outside the ambit of the
Broadcasting Act's provisions.

The Minister added that that Malaysians could now watch programmes
from private TV stations and that subscribed television services
had been introduced last November.

He added that the launch (last January) of Measat 1, Malaysia's
first satellite, was a milestone in the development of broadcasting
and telecoms technology in the country.

"With wise management, satellite TV can help us in our effort to
create an informed society," he said.

Nonetheless, the government has the responsibility to ensure that
the technology will not be misused to jeopardise the national
interest socially, economically or politically, he continued.

The amendments will place the administration and licensing of radio
and television receivers under the direct supervision of the
Information Ministry.

In another report, the Minister for Energy, Telecoms and Posts,
Datuk Leo Moggie was quoted as saying that the development of the
multi-media super corridor and the growth in the number of
television users in the country would help boost the market for
satellite related service, and that Malaysia has surpassed the
average television and personal computers penetration levels for
developing countries.

He said that the telecommunications market in the Asia-Pacific
region had experienced tremendous growth over the past 15 years,
and that the demand for satellite capacity was expected to grow
from some 850 transponders in 1993 to about 1,300 in 1997, and to
more than 2,100 transponders eventually by the year 2000.

MALAYSIAN BROADCASTING: WATCH THIS SPACE

from ASIA PACIFIC BROADCASTING, November 1, 1996

Malaysia certainly looks set to position itself to attract the
major broadcasting companies in its bid to become the region's
broadcasting hub, if the events over the last few months are any
indication.

The evidence is overwhelming: the recent launch of the country's
first national satellite television and radio project, Measat
Broadcast Networks Systems; an initial investment of an estimated
US$2 to $10 billion to realise plans to create a multimedia super
corridor via a new hi-tech city close to Putrajaya, the new
administrative capital; fresh incentives for foreign broadcast
companies to start up in the country, such as preferential
treatment for infrastructural contracts and corporate tax
exemptions; a proposed Bill of Guarantees to regulate intellectual
property legislation to protect investor interests; new amendments
to the Broadcasting Act to legalize parabolic dishes, antennae
decoders and radars; a third Measat satellite by the end of the
decade, amongst many other projects and plans all clearly signal
the country's intent to lead the region in broadcasting and
communications.

The signals say: "yes, we're serious and we want to lead. And don't
take our word for it. Our efforts will speak for themselves." Such
vigour is optimistic, refreshing, and will be exciting to watch.

Encyclopaedia Britannica Sets Big Plans Following Sale


Expanded programs, richer content and enhanced new media products are among
Encyclopaedia Britannica's future plans under the new ownership of an
investment group led by Swiss investor Jacob Safra.

"The new owner expressed interest in investing in content and technology,"
Joseph Esposito, Encyclopaedia Britannica president and chief executive
officer, told BPR.  He said the sale of the company will not spur any major
changes for the 2,400 Encyclopaedia Britannica employees worldwide.

"The sale has given us the capital to go forward...to enable us to compete and
maintain our name as the number one reference publisher in the
English-speaking world," said Esposito, who was promoted from president of
Encyclopaedia Britannica North America to his current position on July 1,
1995.  He succeeded Peter Norton, who retired June 30.

Though terms of the sale to Safra's group were not disclosed, analysts
estimated the property could fetch as much as $500 million.  When plans for a
sale were hinted at in the spring, speculation about possible buyers ranged
from Simon & Schuster to Microsoft.

Encyclopaedia Britannica released a statement in April saying it was seeking
cash to develop new products and sales channels, and that a new owner was one
of three options (BPR, May 22, 1995).  The other two options were a joint
venture partner and an outside investor.

At the time, Encyclopaedia Britannica denied it was leaning toward a sale,
saying it was "considering all alternatives equally."  Encyclopaedia
Britannica was owned by William Benton Foundation, an Illinois not-for-profit
organization whose sole beneficiary is the University of Chicago.

A Happy Ending For The Financial Story?

Encyclopaedia Britannica sales, like those of competitor World Book, have been
lagging in recent years.  Between 1990 and 1993, the number of book-sets sold
fell more than 50% from 117,000 to 51,000.  The company posted a slight
revenue decline in 1994, when it generated sales of $454 million.

According to Esposito, the financial backing from the new owner may allow
Encyclopaedia Britannica to get back on track with new products.  "We'll
expand our program and the content we create," Esposito told BPR.
Encyclopaedia Britannica also plans to further its position on the World Wide
Web.

Sale Comes During Company Overhaul

In August, Encyclopaedia Britannica began to restructure its North American
direct sales forces that is intended to more effectively target lead
generation and sales efforts, as well as reduce administrative costs.

Under the new organization, Encyclopaedia Britannica reduced its number of
sales offices from 91 to 20, and offered sales reps the opportunity to switch
from independent contractor to employee status.  With the shift, the company
has focused its efforts on the 4,800 zip codes from which 70% of its sales are
already generated.

Encyclopaedia Britannica's remaining sales offices are in Maryland, New York,
Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, Colorado, Texas, California, Florida, New
Jersey, Puerto Rico, North Carolina, Minnesota and Canada.

Morrow Brings Rob Weisbach On Board, Forms New Imprint 


William Morrow & Co.  last month lured former Bantam Books senior editor Rob

of readers."

Microsoft Press To Double Sales In Fiscal 1996, Says Welke


Microsoft Press (Redmond, WA), the computer book publishing arm of software
giant Microsoft Corp., expects to nearly double its revenues to more than $80
million in fiscal 1996, ended June 30, general manager Elton Welke told BPR.

The increase will come largely as a result of sales of Windows 95-specific
books, Welke said.  "We're having an astonishing year on top of a very good
year in fiscal 1995," he added.

Despite the fact that the release of the Windows 95 operating system slipped
out of fiscal 1995--where Microsoft Press budgeted for the windfall of Windows
95 revenues to hit--"we made our numbers without it."  and finished fiscal
1995 with $42 million in revenues, Welke said.  "Our fiscal 1996 numbers will
be extraordinary as a result" of the unbudgeted sales of Windows 95-specific
books, he told BPR.

Although Windows 95 has contributed significantly to Microsoft Press's recent
revenue growth, it's not the only topic that's hot.  Internet and professional
training books are doing very well too, Welke said.  In addition, Microsoft
Press will publish two interactive multimedia books on CD ROM this fiscal
year, and intends to release "considerably more" CD ROM titles in fiscal 1997,
according to Welke.

The publisher's most recent run-away bestseller is Windows 95 Resource Kit,
which has more than 1 million copies in print and 600,000 sold to date.

"Our international business is growing at a good clip, Windows 95 books are
selling well, we're continuing our basic line of applications and tutorial
books, we've increased our high-end technical books and we're entering into
interactive multimedia," Welke said.  "Right now, all cylinders are firing."

Banta To Buy Manufacturing Unit From Times Mirror Education Group


Banta Corp.  has agreed to acquire Times Mirror Higher Education Group's
manufacturing division.  Terms of the transaction, which is slated to close in
the first quarter of 1996, were not disclosed.

The acquisition will include the Dubuque, IA-based printing and bindery
operations that primarily serve the three educational publishing companies of
Times Mirror's Higher Education Group.  The Dubuque operation will become part
of the Banta Book Group, which has plants in Menasha, WI and Harrisonburg, VA,
and will remain fully intact with its 230 existing employees, a Times Mirror
Higher Education Group spokesperson told BPR.

The Times Mirror Higher Education Group includes Wm.  C.  Brown Publishers,
Brown & Benchmark Publishers and Richard D.  Irwin, and was the fourth-largest
higher education publisher in the U.S.  in 1994 with an estimated $230 million
in revenues (BPR, Aug.  21, 1995).  Banta will continue supplying the
education group with printing and graphic services after the sale goes
through.

G.  Franklin Lewis, chairman and CEO of the Times Mirror Higher Education
Group, said the company had "conducted a long and diligent search" for a buyer
that "could be a cultural match with the Times Mirror High Education Group;
would pursue the course of providing low-cost printing solutions to our
printing needs; and be a technology partner as we explore new and effective
ways of providing print product as well as increasing access to electronic
product...We believe we have that in Banta Corp."

Warner Bros.  Worldwide Licenses Characters To Seven Publishers


Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing (Burbank, CA) licensed its popular content
and cartoon characters to seven publishers who will produce roughly 90 books
based on the material.  The licenses are part of an ambitious effort on the
part of Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing that will result in the release of
more than 200 books based on its properties in 1996.

The seven publishers who licensed the material are Landoll Publishing, Walter
Foster Publishing, Publications International, Penguin USA, Warner Books,
Scholastic Inc.  and DC Comics.

Of the group, Landoll Publishing (Ashland, OH) will release the first titles
with a 42-book mass market line of color and activity books, paint with water
books, sticker, marker and paint pop-up books and story books.  All titles
will feature Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and other Warner Bros.  characters.  The
line will launch Jan.  15.  Landoll's deal calls for at least 24 additional
titles to be released next summer featuring the Animaniacs, Pinky & The Brain,
Slappy Squirrel and Goodfeathers characters.

Beginning in April, Publications International (Lincolnwood, IL) expects to
release a line of electronic chip "Play-a-Sound" books, each with four, five,
seven or 16 sound buttons.  DC Comics licensed Pinky and The Brain for a line
of 12 comic books to be released in May in the U.S.  and Canada.

Walter Foster Publishing will release two how-to-draw books in June as part of
its agreement.  Later in the summer, two graphic novels based on the
Animaniacs characters will be published by Scholastic Inc.

Though Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing operates separately from Time Inc.
and its imprints, sister company Warner Books (New York) was cut a piece of
the deal through an agreement to publish four adult pop-up books featuring the
Looney Tunes characters.

Finally, next holiday season, Penguin USA (New York) will release a line of
children's titles, including plush books, electronic chip books and paint
books based on Warner Bros.  characters.

Warner Bros.  Worldwide Publishing was launched in 1994 by Warner Bros.
Consumer Products, which handles licenses for Warner Bros.  content and
characters (BPR, March 28, 1994).

House Votes To Allow Lawmakers Book Royalties, But No Advances


In a vote sparked by the year-old ruckus surrounding House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's controversial multi-million dollar book deal with HarperCollins,
the House approved a proposal allowing lawmakers to receive unlimited book
royalties--as long as they have their contracts cleared by the ethics
committee and do not accept advances from publishers.

The House voted 259 to 128 to adopt the rule proposed by Rep.  Gerald Solomon
(R-NY).  The vote flew in the face of a 10-0 ethics committee recommendation
on Dec.  6 to curb royalty income starting Jan.  1, 1996 by including the
monies in the $20,040 cap on outside earned income for lawmakers.

Failure to pass the proposal could have cost Gingrich millions in royalties he
will collect from sales of the HarperCollins title released in 1995, To Renew
America.

Gingrich drew fire when it first became public that he was in line to collect
a $4.5 million advance for a two-book deal he struck with HarperCollins, a
division of media conglomerate News Corp.  The deal was labeled unethical
because News Corp.'s Fox Television Network was embroiled in a battle with the
Federal Communications Commission over foreign ownership of TV stations.
Public outcry forced Gingrich to give up the advance, but not the royalties
the two books will generate.

According to House Democratic Whip David Bonior (D-MI), last week's action
marked the first time a recommendation from the ethics committee was weakened
in a House vote.

In a report on its findings on ethics charges against Gingrich, the ethics
committee last week stated, "The committee strongly questions the
appropriateness of what some could describe as an attempt by Rep.  Gingrich to
capitalize on his office...The committee believes that the existing House rule
must be changed to clearly restrict the income a member may derive from
writing books."

Steck-Vaughn Acquires Summit Learning In $4 Million Deal


Educational publisher Steck-Vaughn last month acquired Ft.  Collins, CO-based
Summit Learning from American Educational Products for approximately $4
million.

Steck-Vaughn was the fifth-largest U.S.  publisher of supplementary
educational materials in 1994 with revenues of $53.6 million, according to
BPR's sister publication, Educational Marketer.  AEP, which also owns
Scott/Hubbard and Churchill Films, was the tenth-largest U.S.  publisher of
supplementary educational materials in 1994, with estimated revenues of $21.1
million.

The acquisition will allow Steck-Vaughn to broaden its marketing channels to
reach school decision makers at all levels through Summit's established direct
response marketing presence among both classroom teachers and consumers.
Steck-Vaughn said it expected Summit's 1995 revenues to top $10 million.

Steck-Vaughn will use Summit as a launchpad for a new line of proprietary
products for the parent and teacher store market.  Until now, Summit has
focused primarily on mathematics curriculum, with a growing presence in
science.

Legal Publishers See Growth Via Electronic Products


Editor's note:  This is the first in a two-part series on the legal book
publishing market.

According to the Book Industry Study Group's Book Industry Trends 1995, the
legal publishing market accounted for $1.3 billion dollars in 1994, up 10.3%
over 1993.  Although law publishers have experienced the same acquisition
frenzy found in other areas of the publishing industry, new owners have tended
to keep their subsidiaries separate, using them to establish or maintain
niches in the marketplace.

A recent informal BPR survey of key legal publishers found that despite the
acquisitions, a fairly level playing field has been maintained.  In addition,
advances in electronic media have revolutionized the way legal information is
published.

"The industry is not necessarily getting consolidated, but there are more big
players," said Paul Wojcik, president & chief operating officer of The Bureau
of National Affairs Inc.  "We might be the largest independent legal
publishing company left."

The Bureau, which reported a 7.3% increase in 1994 operating revenues to
$215.5 million, is entirely employee owned.  Of BNA's 1,800 employees, 1,500
are based in Washington, DC with the rest scattered as correspondents in state
capitals.  Publishing more than 200 print and electronic products of national
scope per year (including four daily publications and a number of
newsletters), the company divides its books into three categories:
Environmental Safety & Health, Human Resources & Labor Management, and Law,
Business and International.  In 1994, the book division reported revenues of
$4.7 million, a company record.

BNA counts among its key titles Media Law by Rex S.  Heinke (1994), the
three-volume Copyright Law and Practice by William Patry (1994), and Mental
and Emotional Injuries in Employment Litigation by James J.  McDonald, Jr.
and Francine B.  Kulick (1994).

The company has discontinued the 28 looseleaf binder version of BNA's
Environment Library and now offers the product exclusively on CD ROM.
Products on CD ROM now account for more than half of BNA's subscription sales.

"The electronic information piece is booming," Wojcik noted.  "It's also the
most confusing part of the business."  A particular benefit of the CD ROM
format, according to Wojcik, is the ability to add large amounts of public
domain information to existing texts.

Thomson Legal Publishing, a division of The Thomson Corp.  (Toronto), made
several key acquisitions in the past year.  The most recent buy included the
topical product business and other non-citation legal information products
from Shepard's McGraw-Hill in November.  The company will integrate Shepard's
products into its existing U.S.  legal publishing operations, which has 3,000
employees and annual revenues of $400 million.

In other acquisitions, however, Thomson Legal Publishing has maintained the
separate identities of its companies, which include Bancroft-Whitney of San
Francisco, Lawyer's Cooperative Publishing of Rochester, NY and Clark Boardman
Callaghan of New York.

Bancroft-Whitney, for example, is devoted to publishing materials for the
California law market.  When Thomson acquired San Francisco-based Barclay's
Law Publishers in February 1995, its California unit was transferred to
Bancroft-Whitney, with the remainder of the company left to function as a
division of Lawyer's Cooperative Publishing.  In November, Bancroft-Whitney
acquired Legal Solutions Inc., a producer of legal forms for California
attorneys.  LSI maintains separate headquarters in Corona, CA.

With approximately 160 employees, Bancroft-Whitney published four print and
six electronic titles in 1995.  Among its major titles are the Witkin library
of four California legal treatises, (which is handled by a separate 15-person
department), Deering's California Codes (186 hardbound volumes, updated
annually) and Barclay's Official California Code of Regulations.  All are
available in CD ROM format as well as print.

Barclay's employs 30 people in south San Francisco.  According to publisher
Laurie Carron, the company's charter as part of Thomson is to "sell to the
non-legal market."  This is achieved by "slicing and dicing" state codes for
businesses into industry-specific products.  "Businesses that are regulated,
not just the lawyers, need these codes," she said.  Barclay's currently
publishes official codes in four states.  "We try to add new states all the
time," Carron said.

The second part of this series will feature Matthew Bender, John Wiley & Sons,
West Publishing, Wolters Kluwer and Reed Elsevier.

Dove flies to larger coop...Beverly Hills, CA-based Dove Audio Inc.  last
month completed a $5.8 million equity offering that will allow it to move to
larger quarters in West Hollywood in February.  Dove used the offering
proceeds to buy the two-story, 22,000 square-foot building that formerly
housed the Writer's Guild of America.  The new facilities will include two
state-of-the-art, fully-digital recording studios, editorial suites, a storage
area with a computerized catalog system to archive all Dove masters, and will
be equipped to do audio and video post-production work.  The building will
also include retail space.  Dove president Michael Viner said the move was
necessary because staff size has doubled over the past year, and noted the
purchase of the building fits with future expansion plans for Dove Audio.

New book finds bumps in 'The Road Ahead'...  A little more than a month after
Penguin USA's release of The Road Ahead by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates,
naysayer Anthony "Andy" Martin has entered the fray with a book of his own:
Bill Gates:  The Robber Baron of Cyberspace.  In announcing the release of his
book, Martin, executive director of a Washington, DC-based organization called
"the Committee to Fight Microsoft Corp.," claims to answer the "dire
forecasts" put forth by Gates in his book.  Martin says his title is based on
"original research, 'inside' Microsoft sources and a searching review of
available public records and documents."  Bill Gates:  The Robber Baron of
Cyberspace is available through its Palm Beach, FL-based publisher, Orange
State Press, for $19.95.  Meanwhile, The Road Ahead ranked as as one of the
top-selling books of the 1995 holiday buying season.

Waterstone's to hit 'The Wall'?...Rumor on the street has it that U.K.-based
parent company W.H.  Smith this month will merge the management of its
respective U.S.  bookstore and music store chains, Waterstone's and The Wall.
A source within the company told BPR it was unclear whether the merger would
extend to the primarily mall-based stores themselves.

'Free Press' coming this month...In an effort to speed Free Press hardcover
titles to press in paperback format, Simon & Schuster will launch a new
paperback imprint this month--Free Press Paperbacks.  The imprint is expected
to release one to two dozen titles a year, the first of which will be The Bell
Curve by Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein.  Simon & Schuster folded The
Free Press hardcover imprint into its trade books division in June 1995 (BPR,
June 28, 1995).  Free Press publishes about 100 titles a year on a variety of
topics, including business, social issues, politics, history and behavioral
science.

People In The News.  .  .


Crown Books parent Dart Group last week lost its knight in shining armor when
Robert Marmon resigned because he and Dart Group could not agree upon an
ongoing compensation package.  Marmon, who has served as Dart's chief
financial officer since October 1994 and was instrumental in putting in place
a plan to restore stability to the company following the raging battles of the
Haft family, will remain at Dart through February to help recruit his
successor.

Separately, Crown Books named John Sutton, Cynthia Holland and Ellen Marshall
as divisional merchandising managers.  Sutton will handle the buying of all
trade fiction, non-fiction and mass market books.  Holland will oversee the
buying of all other merchandise, and Marshall will be responsible for
merchandising operations.  Sutton and Marshall are veteran Crown employees,
while Holland moved to Crown from Waldenbooks in the summer of 1994.

HarperCollins named Matthew Goldberg vice president, director of product and
market development for its Adult Trade Publishing Group.  Goldberg was
formerly director of national accounts at HarperCollins.  In addition, the
publisher named Linda Stormes vice president, director of national accounts.
Stormes moved to HarperCollins from Random House, where she had been national
account manager.  HarperCollins also named Jeff Rogart to the newly combined
position of director of sales/advanced media and merchandise accounts.  In
addition to his current responsibilities for selling HarperCollins' advanced
media products to all channels, Rogart will assume direct selling
responsibilities to Price Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's, as well as the
distributors that serve that marketplace.

Recent appointments at Avon Books included naming Jennifer Hershey as
executive editor and Jennifer Brehl as senior editor.  Hershey joined Avon
from Bantam Books, while Brehl, who will oversee Avon's science fiction and
fantasy list, was previously at Bantam Doubleday Dell.  The appointments
follow those of Debby Tobias to vice president, director of sales, and Trish
Lande Grader to executive editor (BPR, Nov.  20, 1995)

Des Moines, IA-based Meredith Corp.  named Barb Preuss advertising and
merchandising manager for retail book marketing at its publishing group.
Preuss was previously direct mail copywriter at Kirke-Van Orsdel Inc., a West
Des Moines insurance company.

Is DirecTv phenomenon destined for Europe?

The sense of anticipation is palpable. With only weeks to go until two of
Europe's TV giants - CLT and Canal+ - take the bull by the horns and launch
digital services, 1996 could be the year digital TV at last becomes a
reality in Europe.

In the last six months, digital has shifted from being a theoretical,
almost futuristic concept, to a viable business opportunity - maybe even a
necessity. The model in all this is the U.S., where DirecTv and Primestar
have triumphed beyond all expectations, to the extent that digital
satellite television (DST) in the U.S. is now seen as the first genuine
threat to cable's multichannel dominance.

This lesson was rammed home in a fiercely bullish report from SBC Warburg
in December which argued that the success of DirecTv in particular had
transformed the business case for digital satellite. Two examples stand
out: DirecTv's success in pay-per-view, and the potential for
satellite-delivered online services.

DirecTv has resuscitated the comatose PPV market in the U.S., thanks to
more channels (70+), impulse ordering and user-friendly onscreen guides. At
3.78 per month, buy rates are five to six times those achieved by cable
MSOs. The average monthly spend by subscribers on PPV is $17.44 (Primestar,
with more big ticket events and higher prices, generates $32.73 a month).

In Warburg's words, that potentially makes PPV a "really significant
generator of business for BSkyB and Canal+." Warburg's BSkyB valuation
model projects PPV revenues in 2002 of #100 million ($155 million), but its
analysts now reckon this could be too low "by a factor of five times."

Equally significant is the potential appeal of interactive services off
satellite. Using a telephone line as the upstream, digital satellites could
deliver Internet access at more than 30 times the speed of a full
phone-line service. Hughes, the owner of DirecTv, already offers a similar
service in the U.S., DirecPC. In Europe, Kinnevik plans to deliver
satellite online services in Scandinavia this year.

The message is clear. Digital satellite, for so long a mysterious,
uncertain business case for analog pay TV operators terrified of destroying
their existing businesses, in fact holds huge potential. Cable operators
may have to face up to the fact that digital satellite can do almost as
much as their expensive fiber-based wired systems can.



1996: Europe's digital year?

Players in terrestrial TV, cable, satellite, publishing and film all
harbor digital TV aspirations. But in Europe, labyrinthine cross-holdings
and non-competition clauses muddy the waters. Some companies have struck
technological and corporate alliances that tidy up the sector in
preparation for the shift to digital - but many more are needed.

For instance, Germany's Kirch Group has abandoned its unilateral digital
decoder system, the "D-box", and joined the list of companies signing up
for MediaGuard, the digital decoder developed by Bertelsmann and Canal+.
From the moment Deutsche Telekom, which controls 90% of German cable
subscribers, chose MediaGuard, Kirch's surrender became inevitable.

A similar kind of inevitability hangs over the future of CLT's digital
plans, particularly in France. Bertelsmann, News Corp., Havas and Walt
Disney were reported as likely buyers, or at least partners, of the
Luxembourg broadcasting giant, which has plans for digital services in
France and Germany.

The reason for those rumors is simple. In France, a CLT digital package
would compete with a similar planned package from Canal+. The two companies
share a common shareholder, Havas, that is unlikely to fund competing
digital services, nor see Canal+ damaged by a rival service.

Most likely, CLT will either join up with Canal+, or Havas will sell its
stake in CLT to another buyer. In this context, the business logic behind
the rumors about CLT's future is compelling. When added to the
near-certainty that BSkyB has European ambitions, and the best way to
fulfill these ambitions will be in digital satellite, a News Corp. link-up
looks convincing. But Bertelsmann is not likely to countenance an
infringement on its own territory - hence its connection with CLT. tv

Rewe joins Pro 7 to crank up German TV money machine

On the back of unprecedented commercial broadcasting growth, Germany
ushered in the new year with a brand new TV player. Rewe AG, the country's
largest supermarket and discount retail group, took a 40% stake in
fifth-ranked German network Pro Sieben (Pro 7).

Rewe's entry into the TV market may be only the first maneuver in a
process of financial retrenchment and, possibly, consolidation in Europe's
largest TV market. Germany is preparing to quadruple the size of that
market for the second time in 10 years, with the advent of digital TV. It's
also dealing with probable regulatory change and a likely medium-term
slowdown in an advertising market that has been up, up, up for the best
part of a decade.

Cologne-based Rewe's investment in Pro 7 takes some of the heat off Leo
Kirch and his son Thomas - for years they have been accused of playing hard
and fast with ownership ceilings thanks to Kirch pere's numerous
investments.

Pro 7's new alliance, and a planned public stock offering, should dispel
accusations that the broadcaster is unofficially controlled by Leo through
Thomas. Rewe spokesman Wolfram Schumck says the new partner has no concrete
plans with Pro 7 just yet: "We have to get to know each other first."

Rewe massive revenues (DM46 billion ($32 billion) in 1994) will add strong
backing to Pro 7's mission to compete with the other four "major" German
networks - state networks ARD and ZDF and commercial giants RTL and SAT 1 -
in a world of digital channels and fragmentation.

For Rewe, diversifying into commercial TV is in line with board chairman
Hans Reischl's strategy of "investing in promising future markets." Pro 7
anticipates revenues of DM1.45 billion in 1995, with pre-tax profits of
about DM200 million, making it the most profitable network in Germany, with
operating margins in excess of 17%. According to Pro 7 spokesman Torsten
Rossmann, Rewe won't participate directly in financing acquisition of
rights and production costs, "but as a strong shareholder, [it] will
facilitate obtaining bank credits."

The Rewe announcement came soon after Pro Sieben Television's official
conversion into an AG (joint stock company) in anticipation of a summer
1996 public flotation of 35% of the company. The conversion reduces Thomas
Kirch's stake to 24.5% and liquidates the 49.5% stake held by Gerhard
Ackermans.

Pro 7's initial public offering will be a German TV first, offering a
desirable investment vehicle. Pro 7 expects the listing to raise DM300
million. Analysts at London brokerage SBC Warburg have initially valued the
free float in the range of DM700-DM900 million. Prior to the listing, two
businesses may be divested: the film and TV production arm (to be taken
over by Thomas Kirch and Pro 7 MD Georg Kofler) and home shopping channel
H.O.T.

Rewe sources say the price for its stake is well in excess of DM60
million. Assuming Pro 7 maintains annual revenue growth of 8-10% over the
next two years, SBC Warburg's preliminary valuation is in line with
multiples at similar European TV companies such as France's M6 and TF1 and
the UK's HTV and Scottish TV.



Market prospects

With almost 30 terrestrial and cable services available, the German TV
market is the most developed in Europe, even though TV's share of the
advertising market (at $4 billion gross, 20% of the total) still has room
to grow.

German TV's share of total spend is only half the level of that in Spain.
Germany boasts 32.4 million TV homes, 15.6 million of them connected to
cable - a primary reception vehicle for many commercial channels. Since
1990, the number of channels has grown from four to 15.

A concerted effort on the part of most commercial channels to attract
middle market and youth viewers has driven up program costs, both for local
fare and imports. Rights values skyrocketed in 1995, spurred by commercial
TV leader RTL, which forked out $250 million to snatch a Warner Bros.
package from under the nose of the Kirch Group. The deal included TV rights
to 44 prime feature films.

In November, Kirch fought back and stumped up $30 million for German TV
rights to a Steven Spielberg package that included mega-hits Jurassic Park
and E.T. The bid broke all previous payment levels for single film titles.
Public broadcaster ARD separately bought TV options on all properties from
new Spielberg vehicle DreamWorks through the end of the decade.

Whether the channels can sustain such prices is unclear. Efforts to boost
in-house production have brought mixed results at RTL. Pro 7 has stepped up
to the domestic production plate, spending DM400 million in 1995 on its own
TV films and enhanced news coverage. Pro 7's total program budget for 1996
stands at DM1 billion.

Short-term growth in the German TV ad market is likely to sustain the
existing setup, with regulators rather than cash-strapped advertisers
driving investments. In spite of a sluggish 1995 economy, TV advertising
was buoyant last year, with growth estimated at 11% (having jumped nearly
16% in 1994). Zenith Media reckons 1996 will be equally healthy, with TV
forecast to generate over DM6.9 billion.

But not all broadcasters are sanguine about the medium-term: "The
advertising boom is over," says Rossmann. "Growth will be less and
competition harder."

One factor is a growing stable of niche channels fighting over this TV ad
pie. On top of that, the role of the regulator remains unclear. Germany's
law-makers have played kingmaker in the last 10 years, in the face of a
virtual TV "triopoly" - Bertelsmann, Kirch and CLT.

In October 1995, federal regulators drafted rules on channel ownership,
whereby one company will be allowed to control up to 30% of total viewing,
regardless of the number of channels owned. Kirch already takes 29.5% of
the audience; Bertelsmann controls just under 20% and CLT, 22.7%. In
anticipation of the 1997 enforcement of the new rules, 1996 could see the
first phase of channel ownership consolidation.

Digital, however, could significantly alter the competitive balance,
putting Pro 7 and the other "second division" channels in a position to
launch their own stables of channels. Pro 7 has five transponders booked on
Astra's digital satellites 1F and 1G, and should be well-positioned to
expand into pay offerings. tv

Dutch print moves to buy up channels

Two Dutch publishers are buying into TV channels. Dutch bank Mees Pierson
is handling "serious" negotiations between Scandinavian Broadcasting
System's SBS6 and Dutch daily paper De Telegraaf. The newspaper wants a 35%
stake in SBS6 as a springboard for future projects like online services;
SBS6 wants a Dutch backer to solidify its local image. SBS6 wants to buy
HMG's channel RTL-5, but is reportedly offering well below the asking price.
Dutch regional publisher Wegener is close to gaining 100% control of
Arcade Entertainment's three TV channels, radio, music, video and film
retail operation, worth $500 million a year.

ExpressVu and Power/DirecTv have received licenses to broadcast digital

ExpressVu and Power/DirecTv have received licenses to broadcast digital
DTH services into Canada, offering distinct competition to the country's
cable sector for the first time. At the same time, Canadian MSOs - led by
Shaw Communications - were refused a license for their own DTH service,
Homestar.

ExpressVu is owned by BCE Inc. (the parent company of telco Bell Canada)
and broadcaster Western International Communications, among others.
Power/DirecTv is 80%-owned by Canada's Power Corp. and 20% by
DirecTv/Hughes Electronics Corp. The new DTH services will provide as many
as 70 channels of pay-per-view programming, in addition to traditional
services; both services will launch in 1996.

Five new DTH PPV programming services were also licensed, including a new
sports/special events service backed by the CTV Television Network, and
separate movies/special events services from Power/DirecTv itself, Viewer's
Choice/Home Theater and Canal Premiere.

Because there will be competition between the two services, regulatory
body the CRTC will not regulate their rates. Like cable, the new DTH
services will be subject to certain requirements in terms of basic service,
maintenance of Canadian services and open access for all programming
services. They must contribute 5% of their annual gross revenues to funds
that support Canadian program production.

In a nod to increased competition, the CRTC will consider applications for
future DTH services six months after the two new services are launched,
offering a possible second chance to Homestar.

Report round-up

Interactive cable TV will reach only reach 4.6 million Asia Pacific homes
by 2005, according to a report from UK consultants Ovum. In Interactive
Television: The Market Opportunity, Ovum forecasts that 26.4 million
households in the U.S. and 23.1 million in Europe will have cable access to
interactive TV in 10 years.

Cash flow will still be negative in Asia Pacific in 2005 as a result of
the low penetration, but will be positive in Europe by 2002. Interactive TV
will generate $4.31 billion in advertising revenues in Europe and $782
million in Asia Pacific in 2005: both are swamped by the U.S. figure of
$9.03 billion.

After two years of delays, revisions and in-fighting, the Spanish cable

After two years of delays, revisions and in-fighting, the Spanish cable
law was finally passed in the New Year. In the end, it included most of the
amendments demanded by the opposition Partido Popular. Despite that, the
opposition voted against. If the PP wins the election in March, the party
has vowed to change the law.

PP amendments in the bill include minimum and maximum franchise areas of
50,000 and 1.5 million people and a proposal that the second of the two
licenses to be awarded in each area will be decided by a commission
comprising central, regional and local government - a seeming recipe for
bureaucratic disaster.

Perhaps the most contentious part of the law - the automatic awarding of
the first license in each area to telco Telefonica - remains Telefonica has
already launched cable service via Cablevision, its joint venture with
Prisa, cabling 2,600 homes in Barcelona and starting operations in 16
cities. It offers a 40-channel package, including film channels TNT,
Cinemania, and Cine Clasico, and sports channels Teledeporte, Eurosport and
Esportmania (from Prisa).

The potential glitch for Cablevision is the clause in the new law that
forbids Telefonica from launching cable operations until nine months after
the second, commercial license is opened for bidding. Prisa maintains this
does not apply to cities where it has already started operations.

AB launches dawn raid on French digital

French TV production house AB Productions, owned by Claude Berda and
Jean-Luc Azoulay with annual revenues of FFr1 billion ($204.5 million), has
jumped the digital Gallic gun by launching its analog AB1 channel January 1
on Eutelsat II F1. AB also announced plans for a 30-channel digital,
encrypted bouquet with nine channels to be running by February.

AB hopes to sign up at least one cable operator by the end of January at a
price of around FFr2.50 per subscriber per month.

A French government-commissioned report on the future of satellite TV,
published January 4, suggests it is time state-owned France Telecom
acknowledges it cannot compete with Astra and Eutelsat in the DTH market
and abandons its third generation of satellites.

Murdoch bids for Olympic European TV rights

Rupert Murdoch's latest raid on sports rights is aimed at the most sacred
prize of all - the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee says a
consortium led by News Corp. has submitted a "serious bid" for European TV
rights to all Olympic events between 2000 and 2008. Reportedly, the bid is
worth more than $2 billion.

News Corp. has been a mammoth sports rights buyer in the UK, the U.S.,
Asia and Australia. For the past 12 months, the company has been developing
its international sports assets, with News Corp. subsidiary Fox and cable
giant TCI merging their sports channel interests.

News Corp.'s main competitor for the Olympics will be the European
Broadcasting Union, which represents many of Europe's TV networks. Snapping
up long-term Olympic rights is becoming fashionable - U.S. network NBC
practically locked up U.S. broadcast and cable rights to the Olympics until
2008, for $2.3 billion.

Advertising


TV2 monopoly broken
The Norwegian parliament has ended the advertising monopoly held by
national commercial channel TV2. The government had previously outlawed the
use of programming from SBS-owned satellite channel TV Norge by regional
terrestrial broadcasters, since it put TV Norge in direct competition for
advertising with TV2. The government has now allowed the redistribution of
TV Norge's programming. TV2 plans to sue the government for $100 million in
damages from lost ad revenues .

UK cable ads up
UK cable and satellite TV ad revenues are predicted to jump 25% in 1996,
according to a report from merchant bank Goldman Sachs. The sectors are
predicted to increase ad revenues to #171 million ($265.5 million), up from
#137 million in 1995. The total TV ad pie for 1996 is estimated at #2.39
billion.

Cable

UK plans viewing survey
Field work has begun for the UK cable TV industry's first dedicated survey
of audience viewing habits. The Cable Research Firm, representing UK MSOs,
has commissioned the survey, which is due for release in April.

l Brazilian MSO Net Brasil posted a 25% growth in subscribers, to 617,671,
in the three months to November 1995. Subscriber revenues were $23 million
for November, compared to $18 million in August. Net Brasil launched two
cable systems in southern Brazil in November.

l Nynex CableComms, the UK's second-largest cable MSO, announced it was
shedding staff by 10% amid a company restructuring. The move is being made
to cut costs.

Mexico opens telco bids
Mexico's Communications Secretariat has invited telephony license

although the merger is still thought to be going through.

l Iranian police raided 110 houses in Tehran, seizing banned satellite TV
equipment used to watch "corrupting" Western programs, according to local
papers. There are an estimated 250,000 satellite dishes in Iran, despite a
1995 edict ordering the dismantling of all-such equipment.

l In order to satisfy the European Commission's anti-cartel regulations,
Dutch producer Endemol Entertainment could pull out of HMG, the holding
company that owns RTL-4, Veronica and RTL-5, rather than reduce its stake
from 24% to 7.5% (the maximum allowed by European regulations). HMG backers
CLT, VNU and Veronica would each retain a one-third stake.

l The Brazilian Congress will formalize the guidelines for commercializing
the country's telecoms sector early in 1996. Regulations go before a
special congress in late-January (TVI, Dec. 11, 1995).

Satellite

PanAmSat's moves
Arianespace will launch PanAmSat's PAS-7 Indian Ocean Region satellite on

One partner away from dual service dexterity, Argentine MSO goes fiber

"Wanted: investors with cash and experience in telecommunications
services: foreigners welcome." This may as well be the sign outside the
door at Argentine cable operator Video Cable Comunicacion this year. Telco
investment scouts looking south of the border for a well-placed growth
vehicle need look no further than Argentina's largest MSO.

VCC is Latin America's biggest MSO, closing 1995 with 623,400 subscribers,
about 12% of all Argentine subscribers.

VCC was the first Argentine MSO to close a deal with a foreign partner.
Continental Cablevision bought a 50% stake in late 1994 for $150 million -
yet VCC founder-owner Samuel Liberman retained control, which is why there
are no Continental executives stationed in Buenos Aires.

VCC's greatest asset is the geographic spread of its systems - mostly
acquired during a 1993-94 spree - that line a 400-mile industrial corridor
from Buenos Aires via Rosario to Cordoba.

The affluent business corridor generates about 75% of Argentina's GDP, and
if business telephony/data transmission fulfills its promise as the hot
growth center over the next 10 years, VCC is well-placed to take advantage
(rival MSO Multicanal is more widespread outside Buenos Aires, but has
lower penetration in the biggest provincial cities).

But much depends on how alliances shape up. VCC's assistant CEO Carlos
Pratola says that securing another partner - probably foreign - will be a
priority this year, to help develop its telephony business. The company
also aims to build up its Buenos Aires penetration from 50% to 60%.

Regulation remains the key variable. Argentina's telco duopoly, Telefonica
and Telecom, has the option of sacrificing state protection in November
1997 in exchange for permission to enter video services. But the MSOs are
seeking protection from the telcos through a new broadcast bill, soon to be
debated in congress. Argentina's cable operators are asking for a window of
several years to develop telephone services before the telcos muscle in on
their turf.



Despite being one of the most mature Latin cable markets, Argentina's
multichannel market continues to evolve. In 1993, massive consolidation
among the nation's 1,200 cable operators produced four dominant MSOs. In
late 1994, big investments by Continental Cablevision and TCI confirmed
that Argentina's $1.5 billion-a-year industry had enough growth potential
to lure the biggest players.

In 1995, as MSOs focused on standardizing operations among the systems
acquired in 1993-94, the first accord between a telco and an MSO hinted at
the shape of things to come: a converged landscape with a few multi-service
providers dominating the information industry.

By 2000 there may be just three road hogs jostling on Argentina's
info-highway. One certain competitor to VCC is Multicanal, a subsidiary of
Argentina's largest media/entertainment group, Clarin (TVI, Feb. 13, 1995).
Multicanal has an agreement with Spain's aggressive Telefonica
Internacional (TISA), a controlling shareholder in Telefonica de Argentina;
TISA plans to buy 25% of Multicanal.

Four players - Telecom, CableVision (owned by TCI Intl.), Fincable/Cabtel
and VCC - are expected to play major roles in the combined services market,
but mat well pair off. If Telecom teams up with one of the three MSOs, VCC,
by virtue of size, would seem the most likely candidate; talks are said to
be underway.

But Telecom, with a less-focused expansion strategy than Telefonica's, may
take a while to select its partner. Continental and VCC may decide they can
happily focus on finding a U.S. long-distance carrier to pair with.

VCC could also join forces with Fincable/Cabtel, two independent MSOs
administered as one by broadcaster Telefe (TVI, Jul. 31, 1995). There's
already a precedent: VCC considered buying into the Telefe MSOs a year ago,
but Continental balked at spending further dollars in a slowing economy.
Telefe's systems pepper B.A.'s satellite towns and could complement VCC's
presence.



Of more immediate concern to VCC than telephony is tight competition in
the overbuilt sections of greater Buenos Aires. VCC, Multicanal and
CableVision all overlap in the metropolis, along with several smaller
operators.

As a result, the MSOs are racing to upgrade plant, converting 550 MHz
headends to 750 MHz and installing fiber optic lines "to the node." The 750
MHz set-up allows VCC to increase from 50 to 78 video channels (without
digital compression), plus spare capacity for interactive services and
telephony. Internet connectivity should come on line this year.

Such enterprises require capital. Continental's buy-in was a private
transaction with Liberman, so none of the $150 million funded upgrade. But
with the help of Continental's relationship with U.S. banks, VCC secured a
$140 million syndicated loan from Citibank in November 1995.

VCC expects to secure a further $40 million loan in first quarter 1996,
from U.S. semi-governmental bank OPIC, together with the Export-Import
Bank. The loan will finance the purchase of U.S.-made hardware VCC requires
to continue its upgrade.

Though it's debatable whether continuing to add channels makes sense, the
big MSOs are under pressure to offer equal levels of program choices. As a
result, VCC and Multicanal have been playing catch up with CableVision
(TVI, Oct. 30, 1995), which has offered 65 channels since early 1994.
Pratola says that 100,000 VCC subscribers now get 70 channels - the rest 40
or 50 - and all B.A. subscribers should get the full range by second-half
1996.

During 1995 VCC began to distinguish its lineup by grouping channels by
genre. Hence Music 21, MTV Latino and MuchMusic are found on consecutive
channels.

Like its rivals, VCC has its own programming wing, Gala Producciones,
which generates 14 channels. Four of these are marketed outside the MSO,
earning an extra $22 million last year (nearly twice 1994); more channels
are planned. The company's most popular network is kids service Cablin,
ranked within the top 15 B.A. cable channels.



Like all Argentine MSOs, VCC must address the matter of tiering its
service - 70 channels in a single $33 package doesn't make financial sense.
Tiering, the gateway to pay TV, already exists in some provincial systems
where there is little or no competition. But VCC learned in 1992 not to act
alone in B.A.: when it tried to switch HBO Ole to premium status, requiring
an analog decoder, many subscribers switched to competing systems that
still offered the movie channel as a basic service. VCC abandoned the
experiment.

VCC, CableVision and Multicanal will have to agree to introduce tiering at
the same time. An accord may be struck this year due to two precipitating
factors.

First, soccer monopoly Torneos y Competencias (TyC) introduced a premium
Sunday soccer match for suburban B.A. and provincial subscribers last year.

TyC's premium service is available with the installation of an inexpensive
"trap" - a simple decoder on the outside of a house - rather than an analog
box, but many subscribers opt for the latter, which also decodes erotic
channels (scrambled by law). About 10% of VCC subscribers have these $180
analog decoders.

A second factor is the imminent arrival of DTH services which will offer
up a broad range of near video-on-demand and premium program options not
yet available on Argentine CATV. tv

Regulators seek to please all sides in Africa's new Rainbow Nation

It would be an enormous understatement to say that - like everything else
in the country - South Africa's broadcasting environment is changing. The
sector is being reworked from top to bottom, and market forces are vying
with political pressures for regulation in the national interest.

The forces driving change include the new African National Congress-led
government, business interests representing the white and black
communities, and foreign investors cautiously circling over what could be
the gateway to a resurgent Africa.

But there are several vexing issues to be resolved. At a very basic level,
ad agencies and census takers are scrambling to figure out just how many
newly-enfranchised citizens exist in the townships and cities, and whether
and when they will emerge as bona fide consumers. At the political level,
the monolithic South African Broadcasting Corporation represents a mammoth
regulatory chore; already a dispute is brewing between the SABC and the
Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) over what the new SABC should look
like.

The IBA's recommendations for the SABC go to the heart of the new South
Africa's putative broadcasting infrastructure. In late 1995, the IBA
recommended that SABC's channels be cut to two, licensing the network's
third channel as the country's first national, commercial, terrestrial
network.

The SABC's response was to re-launch all three channels, going directly
against the regulatory grain. The issue still has not been resolved.
Legislation along the lines of some of the IBA's recommendations is
expected in 1996, after a parliamentary committee considers its findings.

The SABC's only national rival is pay service M-Net, owned by a consortium
of South African publishers and banks, with 20% held by international pay
operator NetHold. Thanks to its NetHold affiliation, M-Net is now
spearheading DTH developments in South Africa and the entire continent. The
SABC also announced at end-1995 its plans for a satellite service.

At the beginning of January, the IBA said it would begin licensing
satellite services in the second half of 1996, amid uncertainty about
whether its powers actually extended to this activity. NetHold/MultiChoice
have already launched a digital satellite package on the understanding that
no licensing was required, beaming off PanAmSat 4.

The final sector to be affected by the wholesale changes will be South
Africa's still tiny independent TV production industry, now readying itself
for increased demand from both domestic and new, imported services.



Socio-economic changes

Alongside black economic empowerment, the biggest boost to television
viewing will come as a result of the giant housing and electrification
program. In the townships and shanty towns, the new black consumers are
buying - along with cookers and refrigerators - television sets.

In the still desperately-poor shanty town areas around Johannesburg, 42%
of dwellings have TV sets. Significantly, this is almost identical to the
percentage of dwellings with electricity. The scope for growth is enormous
- nationwide, over half of SA homes are still without electricity.

The number of TV homes is estimated at 4.4 million, and the national TV ad
spend is worth $50-$60 per home. Total ad spend is moving from print and
radio to TV, and from whites to blacks. In 1993, pay service M-Net received
around a quarter of all TV ad expenditure. The SABC's main service, TV1,
took 50%, while its more black-skewed service, CCV, took the remaining 25%.
But according to the SABC, in the year to March 1995, advertising revenues
for CCV grew 25.4%, while those for TV1 (whites) grew by only 14.7%.

The SABC's advertising revenues are around R900 million ($246.9 million)
per year. M-Net gets R300 million, putting total TV ad expenditure at
around $329.2 million. The SABC estimates that new commercial competitors
(in both radio and TV) will take R260-R380 million each year from its
annual revenues.

The SABC is also financed by a license fee, which is collected from 2.4
million TV homes, only 54% of estimated TV homes. This system is bound to
be changed. Innovative ideas, such as a tax on electricity consumption,
have been considered.

The SABC's three TV channels have enjoyed, M-Net aside, a monopoly on
free-to-air terrestrial broadcasting. TV1 has a largely white audience and
CCV (Common Cultural Values) a mainly black audience, while NNTV (National
Network TV) reaches fewer homes, catering to a mainly black viewership. The
two main channels carry nearly all the advertising, while NNTV brings in a
small amount of sponsorship revenues. TV1, CCV and NNTV reach 76%, 72% and
56% of the country respectively.

TV1 broadcasts overwhelmingly in English and Afrikaans, and despite 90%
geographical coverage of the population, only reaches 5.4 million adults.
The TV1 signal is also distributed by Intelsat 604 on a frequency covering
most of Africa, but requires a large, expensive dish. The programming mix
is broad-based, and TV1 operates as a mass-audience generalist service.

The CCV transmitter network covers only 20-25% of the country, but reaches
72.5% of the population. Around 80% of its prime time broadcasts are in
African languages and around 75% of its viewers are black.

NNTV, the newest of the three SABC channels, was launched in 1990 to try
to provide for as many of South Africa's 11 official languages as possible.
English takes up 44% of the airtime, with the remainder in Afrikaans (21%);
the Nguni languages, primarily Zulu and Xhosa (21%); and SeSotho (17%).
NNTV is only received in the major metropolitan areas. It also broadcasts
weekly programs in Portuguese and German for those respective communities.
NNTV carries no advertising, but does have sponsorship income.

In addition to the services operated by the SABC, four other
government-owned broadcasting services were established in the former
homelands. The largest is the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation with
a free-to-air service restricted to the area of the former Bophuthatswana
and the Witwatersrand. Unlike the SABC, the former homeland broadcasters
have been funded directly by the government.



The proposed environment

The IBA's proposals for a new broadcasting infrastructure to represent the
new country - and the developing market economy - cover a lot of ground:
the financial viability of the SABC, competition and the development of an
independent production industry. It has much less to say on satellite
broadcasting, though it is proposing future regulation in this area. Cable
does not feature in the IBA's report.

The key IBA recommendation is that the SABC reduce its channels from three
to two by the end of 1997, though it recognizes the corporation may need
another year to downsize and rationalize.

The IBA suggests that some of the programming on NNTV be absorbed into the
other two channels and that NNTV be repositioned as a satellite service.
The former homeland services will be merged with the SABC's two channels.

In January 1998, the IBA will issue a license for a new private
terrestrial network with heavy public service language and local content
obligations. But there is political and commercial pressure for this date
to be brought forward.

There are already a number of contenders for the new service, including
Southern Media, a consortium that includes the UK's Channel 4, black
development group KTI and others. Its rivals include: Free-to-Air, a group
headed by TV1 head Quentin Green; a joint venture including Moribo
Investments, part of the black empowerment group Thebe, and Interleisure;
and MTV South Africa, including Primedia Broadcasting and musician Johnny
Clegg. Others may join the lists.

The IBA favors a regional third TV network because of the centralized
nature of present broadcasting. It also proposes that the SABC have
regional windows in its schedule. The new SA has nine provinces, of which
Gauteng (around Johannesburg) and the Western Cape are the most
economically advanced and have the most extensive production facilities.

There will also be minimum requirements for specific program categories,
which may include minimum hourly requirements across the schedule and
within prime time. Both the SABC and the new private licensee will have
African language conditions imposed.

Foreign investment in SA television is currently limited to 20%, though
this is essentially theoretical, since M-Net has provided the only
investment vehicle to date. The IBA will maintain this limit and will
introduce cross-media ownership limits. No group or person with control of
a newspaper with more than 15% of circulation in the relevant area may have
financial control (a 15% stake) in a radio or TV license.

The IBA proposals are controversial, not least in the way that the SABC
may be carved up. The network's response has been to announce plans to
relaunch its three channels in 1996 as SABC 1, SABC 2 and SABC 3. It says
English-language broadcasts will constitute 65% of its airtime, with
Afrikaans only taking up 3.8%. SABC 1 will use the current CCV signal and
will broadcast in the Nguni languages in prime time. SABC 2 will replace
TV1 and will broadcast in Afrikaans and SeSotho during prime time. SABC 3
will take the NNTV slot, broadcasting in English during prime time.

The announcement has infuriated Afrikaners; the former ruling National
Party has even threatened to block the SABC's attempt to get a R500 million
grant ($136 million) from the government.

This raises the issue of public broadcasting funding. The IBA is proposing
that these services be funded through a mix of advertising and sponsorship,
license fees, government grants and other income such as merchandising.
This would be reviewed after three years. Parliament should also provide
funding on a triennial basis toward increasing African language and local
content programming on the SABC, says the IBA.

The SABC is now mainly funded through ad revenues. In the 1993/1994
financial year, 74% of its income was from advertising revenues, license
fees made up 20%, and other income contributed 6%. There was no direct
state funding or grant, and the corporation achieved a surplus of R106.2
million and generated a cash flow surplus of R77.8 million for the year.



But new programming regulations could cripple the SABC, and state
subventions for increased African language and local broadcasts are
considered essential. The SBAC has already said it cannot meet these local
content requirements (see column, p.5) and stay within budget. It wants the
IBA to reduce "performance periods" for measuring local content to a
maximum of 10-12 hours from 18 hours.

According to the SABC, providing 30 minutes of local news a day in each of
the nine provinces would cost an extra R153.1 million in 1996/1997, R168.4
million in 1997/1998 and R185.2 million in 1998/1999. Local content
regulations (including the upgrading African language provision) will cost
R70.8 million in 1996/1997, R155.8 million in 1997/1998 and R31 million in
1998/1999.

The cost of implementing another report, this time on educational
broadcasting, is estimated at R160.3 million in 1996/7. From January 1 the
SABC replaced Sky News with BBC Worldwide as its main foreign news
provider, and the deal may be extended to include an education package.
Worldwide last September created a new Worldwide Learning Division.

On the positive side of the balance sheet, the state will benefit from the
integration of former homeland broadcasters, saving approximately R120
million per annum. The SABC's Sentech signal generator, which controls its
network of transmitters, will be converted to a public company, with the
shares transferred from the SABC to the state.



Production

Though the SABC figures are vague, independent production currently
constitutes roughly 12.4% of its total broadcast time. The IBA's proposed
regulations in this area are ambitious to say the least: it wants
broadcasters to ensure that, in the future, 40% of their local content is
commissioned from independent production companies controlled by black
South Africans or women and are based in a range of different provinces and
non-metropolitan areas and represent new talent.

The IBA is also determined to break the old boys' club of white male
producers at the SABC. The Film and Television Federation, the Black
Producers Association and the SABC have now joined forces to jointly
develop new commissioning procedures and terms of trade.



Pay TV

Until 1995, there was only one pay TV player in South Africa. M-Net, has 1
million subscribers and is reckoned to be at saturation level, though it
did add around 100,000 subs in 1995. M-Net takes 27% of TV advertising
revenues and is now looking for opportunities elsewhere in Africa.

In October 1993, M-Net sold its subscriber management services and
technology (ComTech) divisions, as well as its investments outside South
Africa, to a new company, MultiChoice, which manages a package of satellite
channels that includes M-Net, as well as handling M-Net's terrestrial
subscriber management.

M-Net had an "open time" arrangement with the SABC for an unencrypted
period in the early evening, but the initial agreement has expired and is
now under negotiation. By a reciprocal arrangement, also likely to be
renegotiated, the SABC's TV1 has been available to MultiChoice viewers in
Africa, while MultiChoice also rebroadcasts TV1 to Namibia.

With M-Net's terrestrial service now mature and the SABC under pressure to
relinquish terrestrial frequencies, the satellite sector offers the most
action. MultiChoice dominates the market, by virtue of having been the only
player for so long, but the SABC has already leaped in to challenge
MultiChoice's dominant position.

M-Net currently beams its programs off Intelsat VI, as well as
broadcasting terrestrially. Intelsat 704, launched in February 1995, has a
Ku-Band spot beam that includes South Africa, as does the recently launched
PanAmSat 4. The SABC and MultiChoice have both leased transponder capacity
on PAS-4.

From July, the SABC started analog transmissions of its terrestrial
services on Ku-band. In October 1995, the SABC's board endorsed plans to
implement SABC-owned DTH television and radio services. The plan
anticipates the introduction of eight digital pay channels to launch by
July 1996 and 14-16 channels by the end of the year.

The SABC says this distribution mechanism will make the "best
international programming available in South Africa." It is already looking
for international players in a package that will include locally-produced
and multilingual programming as well as more recognizable services.

SABC has also talked of launching one free-to-air analog signal aimed at
rural areas and based on education and development-type programming,
another free analog channel carrying local and international product, and
eventually the digital services, mostly sourced from overseas.

In a carbon copy of the situation in Europe, the SABC is complaining to
the IBA that the incumbent DTH operator, MultiChoice, has a dominant
position because of its control of decoder technology. The SABC would like
the IBA to regulate against what it believes is a restraint on competition.
Local analysts doubt this will happen and see MultiChoice retaining its top
spot.

M-Net/MultiChoice is currently offering South Africans 16 digital TV
channels, three radio channels and 40 music channels commercially via
PAS-4, having launched the service on November 1, 1995. The channels
include Supersport, Movie Magic and children's channel K-TV. Soon there
will also be Hallmark, SelecTV, TNT, ESPN Africa, VH-1, TV5 Afrique, and
religious channel Trinity.

Another group, African Satellite Entertainment Corporation (ASEC), is
currently tranmitting two channels off Intelsat 704, beaming into South
Africa from neighboring Swaziland, and claims to have 35,00 subscribers.
But in December, the Swazi communications ministry threatened to withdraw
its license because of non-payment of fees to Swaziland Post and
Telecommunications Corporation.

Estimates of the potential DTH market vary. Estimated dish sales in 1996
vary between 180,000 and 250,000, with around one-fifth digital. The
equipment supplier Aerial Empire estimates the figure in year one of
satellite DTH will be 100,000 systems sold. The saturation point could be
as low as 300,000 digital subscribers.

Digital dish installation is R4,500 and Multichoice costs R175 a month.
Analog costs R1,500 and a four channel subscription will cost R80 from
ASEC. tv

Program quotas

Local television content
Free-to-air terrestrial television
Broadcasters have overall quotas for local content and also genre-specific
quotas.
The SABC must ensure that, within three years of adopting local content
regulations, 50% of its programming during the South African television
"performance" period (18 hours a day) and at prime time meets the following
quotas for specific program categories:
Drama   20%
Current Affairs 80%
Documentary and informal knowledge building     50%
Educational     60%
Children        50%.

Private terrestrial free-to-air television stations must achieve a local
content quota of 30% within the South African television performance period
and meet the following quotas:
Drama   15%
Current Affairs 70%; Documentary and informal knowledge building
40%; Children    30%.

Non-terrestrial subscription broadcasters: local television content
requirements will be set in the form of an airtime or a financial
obligation.
Terrestrial subscription broadcasters (currently M-Net) should have more
local television content - in each year at least 5% of its programming
should be local; or it should spend a specified sum of money per year on
local product. The broadcaster will have to comply with a 30% air time
obligation during unencoded (open) time.

ISSUE HIGHLIGHTS

Happy New Year to all! When the clock changes, we check our smoke
detectors; when the year changes, we check our BUSINESS INFORMATION ALERT
mailing labels! If yours indicates a January expiration date, renew now!
Call, write, e-mail, or fax us with your renewal. We have some great plans
for 1996--you won't want to miss out.

The ALERT staff spent many hours during 1995 redesigning BUSINESS
INFORMATION ALERT. We hope the changes you see will permit easier reading
and access. Besides our new format, you'll notice that Marydee Ojala's
regular two columns are now one: "News and Trends." This change allows her
the flexibility to address those issues of most importance each month. In
addition to our regular articles and columns, we plan to bring you library,
publisher, and vendor profiles. If you work in or know of a library that
functions in an atypical manner, and would like to share your experiences
with our readers, please contact us. If there is a vendor or publisher you
want to know more about, let us know--maybe others are curious.

This month's feature article by Cynthia Shockley came about from a
discussion on the BUSLIB listserv. Cynthia had posted a question asking how
librarians are getting involved in setting Internet policy. For this
article she compiled some of the responses and expanded them into a
practical discussion of how we can organize our involvement in Internet
use, policy, and training. I'm sure you'll use this article--if not now,
then very soon.

Associate Editor

Risk or Reward: Setting Your Organization's Internet Policy
by Cynthia Shockley

Last year Internet use doubled, as it has every year since 1988. At the
same time, use of the Internet's graphical interface, the World Wide Web,
grew almost twenty-fold. No one knows exactly how many people are out there
creating, maintaining, and using Internet sites, but an October 1994
estimate by Internet analyst John Quartermain puts the number at 13.5
million.

One of the leading search sites, Lycos, ran 30 million searches in October
1995. Estimates are that this number will grow to 100 million searches per
month by June 1996. Lycos has cataloged more than 9.3 million Internet site
addresses, called URLs. Given this experience, Lycos began a television
campaign in November 1995 advertising itself as "The Catalog of the
Internet."

Internet content--everything from the text of classical literature to
underground music--is exploding even more spectacularly. Without any
prospect of profit, thousands of individuals have put millions of pages
online--everything from complete libraries of technical information to day-
by-day personal diaries.

How does this dynamic growth impact the library community?

Have you been asked by your organization to develop Internet policies and
procedures? Are you doing the training for your organization? Are you a
Webmaster or on the Webmaster's team?

When such a question was posed on the BUSLIB listserv, some interesting
dialog took place. "You really hit a hot button with that question" replied
a student enrolled in an MLS program. "The one thing that the faculty has
attempted to drill into our heads is that librarians cannot sit and wait
for someone to ask their opinions! We have to get in there and form policy
and procedures or someday we will wake up and our jobs will be gone! The
MIS department (as well as others) will be all too happy to take over if we
don't insist that we be included right from the beginning!"

As Barbara Beverly, Director of Library Services for the New York State
Department of Economic Development, observed "I intend to promote library
access as much as possible since we are being seen as the place to go . . .
however, MIS and other departments don't want to provide much Internet
access because they see it as a big time waster (which it can be). But how
else can people learn?"

How can librarians step into the breach?

How aggressive should librarians be in claiming the Internet as their
domain? The Internet is an information utility and, as such, it is best
understood by us. If we don't participate, others--those less trained in
the art of cataloging, searching, and retrieval who are delving into the
world of electronic resources--will take the job. In that case, librarians
will run the risk of losing more of their organization's info-business
market share (and, eventually their jobs).

=======================================
Step 1: Develop Internet Use Guidelines

Your organization should have an Internet policy and procedures for its use
so that your fellow employees will know what the boundaries are as they use
the Internet. One major U.S. corporation published its Internet use
guidelines on its Web site for its employees. The topics covered are
specific and follow common sense. For example:

* behavior resulting in disciplinary action (e.g., sending threatening
messages);

* behavior considered prudent and good manners (e.g., include a signature
with an e-mail message reply);

* behavior as a participant on listservs and newsgroups (e.g., actively
disclaim that you are speaking for the company and obey copyright laws);
and

* behavior for using file transfer protocols (e.g., don't ftp during prime
business hours).

As noted in the third item, obeying copyright laws is a very critical rule
that should have clear direction from you as a librarian. The library
community is actively working on how the letter and spirit of the copyright
law translate into applications in an electronic, networked environment. We
should be there to guide our organizations in developing their policy
statements with respect to copyright laws. Your fellow employees should
know that their seemingly innocent acts of copying downloaded material are
often serious violations of copyright laws.

You also may want to develop guidelines for patrons using the Internet
while in the library. Glen Whitmill of the New Castle-Henry County Public
Library System posted an e-mail message on a library listserv encouraging
librarians to comment and provide input on his library's "Computer Usage
Policy" draft. (The URL is http://www.nchcpl.lib.in.us/Library/LibraryInfo
/InternetPolicy.html.) This policy covers use by both staff and patrons of
the Internet. Guidelines are straightforward and practical and require that
a patron sign a limitation of liability statement to help protect the
library.

====================================================
Step 2: Volunteer to Train Employees on Internet Use

We librarians are guides to information. The more information there is, the
more your organization needs a guide. As described above, the material that
resides on the Internet is growing at a phenomenal rate.

For example, one librarian responding to the listserv query reported that
"we started out providing access to the Internet in our nonprofit
organization by providing individuals with dial-access accounts . . . later
we installed our headquarters node and made it an item in the library's
budget. Computer Services did not want to do it, so we did. Computer
Services did participate in selecting a provider and oversaw all the work
of installing the hardware and software. We agreed between us that the
library would be responsible for training users."

We are comfortable instructing individuals on how to identify, search, and
access information resources and should continue that role. Another
librarian serving a scientific community observed "one thing was readily
apparent and that was 'Internetting' was not going to be intuitive . . . it
was felt that since the Internet was going to be difficult to navigate, it
would be good if we could do something to smooth the way for our
clientele."

================================================
Step 3: Develop Internet Construction Guidelines

As librarians, you also should participate in developing policy and
standards for the material that is to be posted as part of your
organization's Internet presence. As the number of people engaged in
placing information on the Internet increases, so does the variety of ad
hoc organization, presentation, and style. Typically, MIS staff--often
assigned to take the lead role in preparing an organization's Internet
presence--are not aware of the commitment that the organization is making
by placing electronic documents and information on the corporation's
Internet site. They haven't thought about the value of the information over
time; retention and updating requirements; how to migrate the material to
the coming generation of electronic storage systems; or how to cite and
classify the material to facilitate users in finding it.

Managing information is what we do by trade. Here are some possibilities
for contributing to the development of your organization's Internet
presence:

* Work on document construction guidelines that use hypertext markup
language (HTML) standards.

* Establish required content guidelines for each page: e.g., name of group
responsible for data, number and size of graphics, contact information, and
date last information was revised.

* Establish a process to continually acquire, revise, and update linked
resources on the Internet including how links will be identified,
established, and checked.

* Articulate and publicize the criteria for documents published by the
organization destined only for the Internet so that the material can be
searched as a hypertext linked document since often users no longer read
serially.

* Assist in identifying materials placed on the Internet that have
permanent value and should be considered candidates for organizational
archives.

* Evaluate various search and retrieval engines: e.g., Lycos, WebCrawler,
Yahoo, World Wide Web Worm, InfoSeek Search, and Open Text Web Index.

* Develop compatible cataloging (i.e., field names and record structures),
indexing, and keyword schema to support the selected search engine.

* Determine which parts of the organization's Internet site have data that
is not to be shared with all user communities and therefore should have
limited access.

In sum, if we as librarians are willing to take some risks in stepping up
to our organization's needs, we can help our fellow employees smoothly
accelerate and merge onto the Internet infobahn.

Items on Knight-Ridder, IAC Newswires Codes, Dow Jones Offerings, Lexis-
Nexis Software, M.A.I.D. Web Site, Avenue Technologies Home Page, B & I on
CD-ROM, ISI Current Awareness

by Marydee Ojala

New Year's parties are over; the champagne's all gone; and it's now time to
focus on 1996 as a business year. As you can see, BUSINESS INFORMATION
ALERT has changed its look somewhat. I can tell you that it was quite
exciting to exchange ideas about the new look via e-mail and fax. It was
less time consuming than formal meetings and, in the end, we probably
reached better conclusions about design and content than if we had been
sequestered in a conference room somewhere. We weren't distracted by the
peripheral discussions that always seem to impinge on the main topic--even
in the best run meetings.

For the past several years, I have been writing two columns: one for
database current awareness and one called "For Your Information."
Increasingly, I was finding it more and more difficult to decide what items
to put in which column. The dividing lines between databases, search
services, CD-ROMs, books, consumer hosts, and the Internet were (and are)
becoming more fluid. The simple fact is that business information
specialists must keep up with sources in a wide variety of media. Rather
than waste time trying to categorize and classify current awareness by
database or general knowledge, we threw out the whole idea. As of this
issue, the "News and Trends" column will confront any media, so long as it
is worthy of the attention of business information specialists, AKA you,
our readers.

=========================
Knight-Ridder's New Looks

Following in our footsteps of redesign (well, probably not, but I'd like to
think so), Knight-Ridder Information has consolidated the customer
magazines of Dialog (Chronolog) and DataStar (Knight-Ridder Information
News). The new publication will be called Chronolog, and there will be both
a U.S. and a European edition.

If the first issue is any indication, the U.S. version will be slightly
larger (16 versus 12 pages for the December 1995 issue) due to additional
information and search tips about Dialog databases. Articles are shorter
and more to the point than in the previous Chronolog, but not as brief as
those in the former Knight-Ridder Information News. Hopefully the style
changes will translate into more customers reading the newsletter. Dialog's
Chronolog grew to the point of being almost unreadable. Plus, I found too
many recycled press releases and articles I'd already read in producer
newsletters.

Let's hope Knight-Ridder's new newsletter will truly do what they say it
will: Give us solutions to our information problems and maximize our time.
Serials librarians will be distressed to note that the change occurs with
the last issue of the 1995 volume year, rather than the first issue of the
1996 volume year. For more information, contact Knight-Ridder at 800-334-
2564 or 415-254-8800.

==================================
Information Access Codes Newswires

Well known to business searchers are the Predicasts product codes, most
frequently associated with the PROMT database. One of the big questions
when IAC bought Predicasts was, "Why don't you apply the Predicasts product
codes to your other business files?" Usually what searchers had in mind was
Trade & Industry.

IAC took care of that in early 1994 with some 75 percent of Trade &
Industry records from that time forward being coded with the Predicasts
product codes. Now the Predicasts codes are being added to another IAC
database. This time it's Newswire ASAP. The enhancement comes in
conjunction with a reload on Dialog to take advantage of the standardized
field structure tagging. As part of the reload, Newswire ASAP can now be
accessed from outside North America. For more information, contact
Information Access Company at 800-227-8431 or 415-378-5269.

================================
Dow Jones Expands Text Offerings

Dow Jones News/Retrieval's Text Library has expanded by 67.5 percent. A
great deal of this is due to the addition of IAC databases PROMT, Trade &
Industry, and Industry Express. Interestingly, IAC has relinquished the
database brand names when articles from these three files are added to Dow
Jones.

When you retrieve an article from any of the thousands of sources
represented by the IAC databases, they will be labeled as coming from
Information Access Company, not from an individual database. Other sources
contributing to Dow Jones' growth include the Federal Document Clearing
House (FDCH), which provides complete coverage of developments in the
federal government. That includes news conferences, congressional hearings,
White House meetings, speeches, and briefings.

On the international side--but only searchable in North America--are the FT
McCarthy press clippings. A subsidiary company of the Financial Times
(London), FT McCarthy provides company, industry, and market news clipped
from major European newspapers and business magazines. For more

Profound Chooses the Internet

In one of his typical profound quotes, M.A.I.D plc CEO Dan Wagner, declared
recently: "Online is the Internet and the Internet is online." That was to
preface his announcement that the Profound Business Intelligence Online
Service will use the Internet as its main delivery mechanism.

Essentially, M.A.I.D has transformed its VAX cluster of computers into a
gigantic Web site--rather than use client/server technology--and will use
Netscape as its browser. If the final product is like the prototype, you
will be able to search the various Profound databases, including Textline,
five IAC files, market research reports, company data, and wire services
using M.A.I.D.'s InfoSort indexing.

The Internet service will run in parallel with Corporate Profound,
Profound, and Profound Business Facts on the Microsoft Network. For more

COMPANY INFORMATION--
Hoover's Guide to Computer Companies


Lawrence Hagemann & Eric Nee, eds. 1995. The Reference Press, Inc.
Softcover & disk versions. 667p. ISBN: 1-878753-79-7. $34.95

This is a new title in Hoover's stable of excellent and inexpensive
business directories. This particular title was published in conjunction
with Upside Publishing Company, a respected publisher of material on
emerging technology trends and their impact on the computing industry.
Upside editors contributed a brief overview article of the computer
industry and a 12-page list of who's who in the industry that includes
brief biographical information. The list-lover's compendium is expanded and
includes lists of the top companies and retailers from various sources in
addition to the Hoover's list of rankings.

The main sections contain the traditional two-page profiles, including 10
years of financial data (where available) of 77 "industry leaders" and one-
page profiles (with six years of financial data) of another 173 "selected
industry players." Another section includes a bare-bones description of 885
companies, providing only their addresses, top officers, 1994 sales, and
number of employees. There are two indexes, one of companies by
headquarters location and the other by brands, companies, and people. An
extra added attraction is an electronic version of the text on disk using a
Windows program, which will permit you to export data to other programs and
create mailing lists.

In this rapidly changing industry this is a good, inexpensive source for
all types of libraries. Other people interested in the computer industry
will find it an excellent initial source to consult. For the latest
information you will need to consult either specific-industry periodicals
or online databases. Hoover's Guide to Computer Companies is definitely a
recommended acquisition.

ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT--
Vitality and Renewal: A Manager's Guide for the 21st Century


Colin Hutchinson. 1995. Praeger Publishers.
344p. Hardcover, ISBN: 0-275-95233-9, $69.50;
softcover, ISBN: 0-275-95234-7, $24.95

Written from a British perspective, but applicable to the U.S., this book
calls on business leaders to take a proactive role in moving us away from
our current wasteful use of resources to a sustainable economy in which
conservation and recycling are the norm. Author Colin Hutchinson quotes Gro
Harlem Brundtland, "Sustainable development . . . meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs," and predicts we have 40 years at most to meet our
environmental challenges.

Hutchinson's nonjudgemental and holistic approach distinguishes this book
from other more polarized environmental calls to action. He provides middle
and upper management with a framework to create environmental solutions. He
also introduces the skills needed to lead a partnership of ecological
organizations, government agencies, and business to a sustainable society.
Recognizing that the ability to bring about changes in organizational
cultures will be fundamental to achieving the goal of a sustainable
economy, Hutchinson predicts change management skills will be the key
business tool for the 21st century.

Practical techniques to bring about and manage change in an organization
are provided. Specific examples are given of corporations that have
assigned priority to ecological concerns and that have made significant
progress in controlling their effect on the environment. For instance, from
1985 to 1991, Dow Chemical cut its air emissions in half in the U.S.

Hutchinson also advocates a redefinition of economic metrics. For example,
our current measures of economic success, such as the Gross National
Product, are correlated with factors such as pollution emissions and linear
consumption of resources. In support of Hutchinson's recommendation, at
about the same time this book was published, the World Bank announced a new
system for calculating a country's net worth by assigning values to its
natural resources, capital investments, and worker productivity. Using this
new scale, Australia and Canada were rated by the World Bank as the globe's
two richest nations. The U.S. came in at 12th place.

Appendixes contain environmental checklists, and a list that identifies
major corporations with formally defended environmental policies. There is
an annotated bibliography to some 100 publications and an extensive roster
of organizations available as resources for further information or data.

Readers may initially question Hutchinson's premise that an individual, or
even a single firm, can realistically make a dent in the complex global
environmental problems facing us today. But the increasing number of
articles in the popular press about participatory management, the growing
empowerment of the individual, and the voluntary downshifting to simpler,
but higher-quality lifestyles supports Hutchinson's thesis.

Hutchinson concludes by challenging business readers to make a difference
in their organizations and communities. By taking charge of environmental
impacts, first on an individual level, then on the corporate, and finally
on the community level, Hutchinson believes business leaders have the
opportunity and the responsibility to move us to a sustainable economy.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY--
Business & Industry


1995. Responsive Database Services, Inc.
Dialog database

Business & Industry(tm) (B&I) looks as if it is another "must" in the
growing list of databases essential for thorough online research. The
October debut of B&I on Dialog and Data-Star has tongues wagging in online
circles.

B&I is produced by Responsive Database Services, Inc. (RDS), a new venture
founded by Dick Harris, formerly president of Predicasts. Early on, RDS
scored big points with its exceptional marketing push to get search
materials out to registered Dialog and Data-Star users several weeks prior
to the generous trial period. This is a wakeup call to producers who can't
seem to get materials out the door.

B&I is not duplicating the efforts of other international business
databases, e.g., Promt or F&S Index. A comparison of B&I's source
publication list to Fulltext Sources Online and Books & Periodicals Online
confirms that a majority of the publications available on B&I are also
available elsewhere but not necessarily from Knight-Ridder. Such
publications as Wirtschaftswoche, once available only through Genois, will
now reach a wider audience. B&I has limited date coverage beginning in July
1994 and plans to update daily. B&I editors exclude stories from wire
services, market research, and analyst's reports. Searchers who have waded
through similar data in Promt will applaud this decision since separate
searches are often required in unique databases.

Although the manual claims B&I's index system is "user-friendly, . . . easy
to remember and easy to apply," don't toss the documentation just yet.
B&I's indexing system consists of concept and marketing terms, product and
geographic codes, industry and company names, and document types.
Additional indexes include trade names, spokespersons, and slogans.

Here are two important points for experienced searchers: PC codes are
automatically truncated, and the concept term for market share (ct=market
share) may be a popular change from such keystroke gyrations as
market?(5n)share?. The marketing terms are especially welcome and reflect
the best of Marketing and Advertising Reference Service (MARS). The Dialog
search examples provided in the documentation are straight forward, and
standard display formats apply. Format 8 gives title, word count, and
indexing. Format 8 also indicates if an article is available in full-text.
(Searchers may also limit the search to this format by entering /FULLTEXT.)
Unfortunately, the enhanced title feature B&I has touted is not available
with a format 8, KWIC, or title display. RDS has made sure it gets a few
cents for this great feature.

Finally, a remark about the "indicative statement" that RDS provides at the
end of abstract records. If the statement begins "article contains little
further information. . . ": beware! That precious "little" may be the
missing information you've spent time and money to find.

Internet Connection: Your Guide to Government Resources


Jeff Steinman, ed. 1995. Bernan Press.
Newsletter, 10 issues. $69

Since the early 1990s, government agencies and departments have been
exponentially increasing electronic publication of government documents and
records. Accessing these databases is sometimes only slightly less daunting
than finding those databases on the Internet. Good Web browsers, gopher
indexes, and other electronic Internet site locators are increasingly
available for those savvy information providers who regularly navigate the
Net. The Internet Connection: Your Guide to Government Resources is a print
resource intended to keep you informed about government sites on the Net.
It does just that.

This newsletter is not intended to teach readers about the Internet.
Consequently, a lot of space is not wasted defining terms. It is especially
useful for corporate information professionals or sophisticated academic
librarians who assist users in research or are responsible for their
institution's Web Site. Its drawback is that when you find a good
government reference, you cannot just electronically "forward" the
information to someone else.

On average, five government resources are brought to your attention per
issue. An example of one resource is the editor's article, "Tax Forms for
FedWorld." In this article (typical of what you will find), the Internet
address is provided. Step-by-step instructions for logging on and
maneuvering through FedWorld to get to the subject of the report are
provided. Helpful hints and good explanations for downloading the tax forms
are used. In this article little explanation is required for what a tax
form is but other articles do explain the scope of the government resource.

What I liked most about the newsletter was its back-page diagram outlining
government resources at a glance. The diagram summarizes what has been in
the previous seven pages and is a precursor to an annual index. Other
serials taking this same approach include Internet World, which places
resources by subject on its back page. Information professionals should
find a use for those back pages because when the amount of space required
for the at-a-glance summary, the table of contents, and white space is
deducted, there is little more than five pages of new and usable
information.

Bernan Press is a reputable government book wholesaler, and its reputation
lends credence to this guide. What I found most helpful informationally,
were the opinions and valuative comments about the particular government
resources it is guiding you to. Information about the quality of access,
currency, maneuverability, and scope are the valuing tools information
professionals need to know before recommending. Those professional
guideposts would be worth the subscription.

Internet Tools of the Profession: A Guide for Special Librarians


Hope Tillman, ed. 1995. Special Libraries Association.
Softcover. 250p. ISBN: 0-87111-430-5. $37.50

This reference book is a combination dictionary/teaching tool on
researching on the Internet. It is also a guide to sample locations of
information, arranged in some cases by subject and in others by unique
Special Libraries Association (SLA) interests. As it is an in-house
publication intended for SLA members, part of its layout follows the
division/geographic organization of SLA. Internet resources therefore are
divided into the 28 SLA subject divisions. Seven, including business and
finance, chemistry, education, food/agriculture/nutrition, information
technology/networking, nuclear science, and pharmaceutical provide
evaluative resource lists. The other divisions have a hit-or-miss list
without evaluations. The editor tells us that this is because many
divisions were not able or willing to participate. Therefore, the list of
subjects is not in itself a ranking of importance as an arbitrary and
random self-selection.

Authors of the evaluative lists follow the same editorial outline,
including detailing the purpose and value of that particular title. The
selection criteria for putting a title on the lists is, however, solely the
author's. For example the 19 resources cited under Information
Technology/Networking were selected because they may be used for keeping
current and are helpful for librarians who train others in accessing the
Internet. On the other hand, the 19 resources selected under Education were
chosen for their representation of the diverse interests of the division's
membership. Food/Agriculture and Nutrition titles were selected because of
their proven usefulness in that type of library.

The publication's value to information professionals lies less in the small
highly selective subject lists, than in the evaluative information provided
with some references. When used in conjunction with the index, the lists
may prove helpful. Its other great value to the SLA member is the 34
addresses where SLA discussion groups can be found. Enough information is
provided to be able to either find a forum or subscribe to the lists. The
editor is correct that there is a need for updates to these lists. Sample
screens were found helpful.

This publication is not a must for libraries. Comprehensive subject guides
exist in print and on the Net. It is however a helpful resource for the
personal professional growth of information professionals. It will
certainly aid new SLA members who join a division and wonders what core
Internet resources are peer-recommended.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS--
Doing Business in the New Vietnam


Christopher Engholm. 1995. Prentice Hall Publishers, Inc.
Hardcover. 256p. ISBN: 0-13-325853-X. $24.95

This reference book contains guide information about doing business in
Vietnam today. The comprehensive volume accommodates information about
Vietnam on a range of business topics including country profile, selling
to, investing in, and working with the Vietnamese. Additionally, it affords
up-to-date information including useful business addresses, trade contacts,
sample contractual agreements, and visitor information.

Many informed business leaders and scholars see Vietnam as the hottest new
business frontier in the Pacific Rim. In spite of its stigma as a
"communist country," Vietnam is experiencing booming growth with negligible
inflation, a standardized currency, low labor rates, and a population of
70-plus million with a work-hard philosophical background. Today, with
recent (and continuing) government and market reforms, business and
commerce in Vietnam operates as a near "free market economy" system. All
this rapid economic expansion offers opportunities for exporters,
investors, entrepreneurs, and business executives.

To write this book, Engholm draws on his experience, which includes
founding The Engholm Group--which specializes in public relations and
company representation in Asia and Latin America--international business
consulting, presenting seminars, and writing this book. In this practical
guidebook, he provides dozens of useful tips and effective strategies for
developing profitable relationships with Vietnamese businesses and the
Vietnamese people. Engholm's previous books are Doing Business in Asia's
Booming "China Triangle" (1994) and When Business East Meets Business West:
A Guide to Practice and Protocol in the Pacific Rim, the Asia and Japan
Business Information Sourcebook (1991).

The book opens with a preface, short introduction, and brief glossary of
key terms and acronyms. Its four parts contain four chapters each. Part 1
contributes a profile of the people, the economy, the politics, and the
business scene. Demographic and economic facts, the official government
structure, a chronology of Vietnam-U.S. relations, and the climate for
business are analyzed. Historical background, the Chinese influence, and
the Vietnamese people and their work ethic also are addressed.

Part 2, "Selling to Vietnam," confronts the primary marketing topics.
Chapter 5, "What Vietnam Wants to Buy," points out many facts that go
beyond what standard summary statistics would indicate. Even though Vietnam
is statistically one of the poorest countries in the world with a GNP per
capita of only $200, disposable income by consumers varies greatly. Among
the 72 percent of the populations still working in agriculture, many cannot
even afford a bicycle and earn barely $50 per year. On the other hand,
about 49 percent of the urban households have at least one motorcycle (with
new Hondas selling for $1,700). Details about entering the market
(import/export regulations, setting up a sales representative's office,
rent, registration, and bank accounts); channels of distribution
(wholesaling, retailing, channels, shipping, customs/clearance, and
warehousing); and advertising and promotion (trade shows, billboards,
regulation, cost/rates,) are presented.

"Investing in Vietnam" is the topic of Part 3. Issues such as why and with
whom to invest, types of foreign venture allowed, foreign investment
regulation, favorable regions (provinces) for investment, regulations and
license requirements, finding local investment partners, the rapidly
emerging private sector, project approval and start-up, working with
Vietnamese labor, finding skilled workers and recruiting managers,
unionization and strikes, and wage administration are discussed. Chapter 11
looks at the in's and out's of "Transferring Technology" and presents
Vietnam's attitude toward Western technology. The part's final chapter
deals with financing, taxes, and commercial disputes. The banking sector
and capital markets also are explained.

The fourth and final part, "Working with the Vietnamese," centers on
business culture (differences with other Asian countries, trust-based
relationships, gifts and bribes, and managing and motivating workers);
communicating and negotiating (use of an interpreter, meeting approaches
and tactics); essential etiquette and protocol (business cards, names
usage, dining and drinking, gifts, holidays, and "lucky and unlucky" days);
traveling (hotels, air/road/train, health and safety risks, money matters,
working hours, entertainment and shopping, recreation, what to bring); and
living in Vietnam (paperwork required, renting a house, community support,
and life quality). The work's appendixes provide useful business and trade
contacts with addresses and phone numbers, sample contractual agreements,
and visitor information (addresses and phone numbers of airlines, hotels,
museums, restaurants, and nightclubs/discotheques).

This well-written guide equips readers with an array of good advice. For
example, knowing how to avoid costly mistakes when dealing with the
government and how to conduct yourself through the intricacies of
socializing could make the difference between success and failure in a
business venture. One of the strengths of this book versus other recent
books on the same topic (Doing Business in Vietnam, 1995 by James W.
Robinson; Vietnam: Business Opportunities and Risks, 1995 by Joseph P.
Quinian; Vietnam: A Business Handbook, 1994 by Neil Ashwood) is that it
covers the topics by asking and answering practical yet probing questions
such as, "What is the Vietnamese attitude toward American business and vice
versa?" and "Should a firm begin promotion of its products and services at
a trade show in Vietnam?". Additionally, the book is enhanced with about 25
pages of photographs and numerous graphs, tables, and charts to add to and
clarify the volume's content.

Doing Business in the New Vietnam is recommended for practicing managers,
consultants, government officials, academics and advanced students, and
others interested in pursing import/export trade, investment, or additional
commerce-driven interaction with the economically-emerging new Vietnam.

JADE: Japanese Accounts and Data on Enterprise


1994. Bureau van Dijk Electronic Publishing Inc.
CD-ROM database. $12,000

This intriguing product will be useful to anyone working with the Japanese
market. Teikoku Databank has long been know as a leading supplier of
corporate credit information from Japan. Its two English language online
databases--one of profile data and one of full financials--have made it
much easier for researchers to find information on Japanese companies.

JADE takes the information from the Teikoku Full Financial database, adds
several useful data items, and tops it with a powerful package of financial
analysis software. The database covers some 10,000 Japanese companies,
providing a full range of profile information (name, address, telephone,
year of incorporation, number of employees, credit rating, trading banks,
CEO background, to name a few); financial data (balance sheet and profit &
loss account in a standardized format); and 22 ratios calculated from the
balance sheet. A welcome addition to Teikoku Databank's standard
information is U.S. Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), UK SIC, and
NACE codes. These do not translate perfectly to Teikoku Databank's own
Industrial Classification, but Western searchers will find them much more
familiar.

Searching is straight-forward and fast. In addition to the profile
information, it is possible to search by the 22 ratios, 12 financials, or
the year-on-year trends of those financials. Once a company or companies
are found, there is a wide variety of reports that can be produced,
including those in user-defined formats. The financial analysis software
allows users to get a detailed analysis of an individual company's
finances. In addition, it permits analysis of a group of companies, or of
one company relative to its peer group. The results of the analysis can be
in report format or a selection of effective graphic formats. It is also
possible to download data for use in other software packages. Several
custom export formats such as dBase, Lotus, Excel, are included, as is
ASCII and DIF.

In general, the interface is very clean and easy to use. As a sample
application, it was quite simple to select manufacturers of cameras,
identify the most profitable firm in terms of Return on Investment, display
its cost structure, and compare several of its performance ratios to the
industry norm over time.

The one caveat has to do with the nature of Japanese financial reports.
Financial reporting standards in Japan are significantly more lax than
those in the U.S. Also, there are several differences in practice, such as
reporting stocks at book value, that can lead to different results than
would be expected under Western standards. All this should be kept in mind
when interpreting one's findings.

The database is updated quarterly. It is available for DOS and Windows and
can be included on local and wide area networks.

REFERENCE--
The Directory of Business Information Resources


Ed note: Although this publication is a third edition, we included it due
to its relevance.

3d ed. 1995. Grey House Publishing.
Softcover. 1,197p. ISBN: 0-939300-60-5. $155

This third edition of The Directory of Business Information Resources is a
hefty softcover with 1,197 pages of information on 90 different industry
groups, form accounting to wholesalers. When evaluating this book, one's
immediate reaction is to compare it to its venerable predecessor, Gale's
Encyclopedia of Business Sources (EBIS), now in its 10th edition in two
hardcover volumes. The younger directory comes off fairly well in
comparison, though it's a bit like comparing apples and oranges. Here's
why.

According to the numbered entries, The Directory of Business Information
Resources contains 13,489 brief paragraphs that describe the associations,
newsletters, magazines, trade shows, directories, and databases in each
industry. Each entry is listed only once, unlike EBIS where the same
information can be listed numerous times under different categories. The
Directory is much more straightforward in its arrangement, which makes it
easier to use but also much less sophisticated for subject searching. For
example, in EBIS, the accounting section contains numerous "see references"
and divides the industry into subgroups such as cost accounting, government
accounting, and accounting research. This means the reader has to guess
which section to look under and also creates entry duplication. The
Directory, on the other hand, has a 14-page section on accounting with no
"see references" and all entries placed together according to type. It is
one-stop shopping at its best.

Typical directory entries contain brief, basic information: name, address,
phone, and fax number, one contact person, and either a description that
can be as brief as one line or no description at all. There are no
electronic addresses, and information such as association membership
numbers or publication print schedule is often missing. This fact makes for
very uneven value among entries.

EBIS tends to treat the "whole industry" as it were, with sections that
include statistics sources, financial ratios, and price sources in addition
to the basic section echoed in The Directory. EBIS also treats the business
world in general in much more detail, by including discrete sections on
such topics as employee motivation, acid rain, and AIDS policy.

The Directory of Business Information Resources has some curious omissions.
For example, the Computers & Data Processing Industry section makes no
mention of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) nor the Institute
for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), two of the largest
organizations in the field. Nor does it include such widely circulated
publications as Infoworld, PC Magazine, or PC Week, though it does have
Computerworld, PC Computing, and BYTE. These important omissions in an
industry with which I am familiar lead me to suspect there may be similar
ones in other industries. Some of the more obscure entries for this
industry, such as NEWMEDIA and Proclaimer, listed in the "Magazines &
Journals" section, contain no descriptive information and therefore are of
very limited utility.

Another glaring omission is in the health care of medical industry, which
is of great current importance, but is all but ignored except for the
mention of a few publications scattered throughout the book. However, this
industry is very well treated in EBIS. Yet The Directory includes such
eclectic groups as the "gifts" industry and the "motorcycles" industry.

One definite plus for The Directory is its entry index, sorely lacking in
EBIS. The Directory's other index is a publisher index. Since reference
works of this type are generally used to find information on a topic
unknown to the researcher, a subject index also would be helpful to
indicate to users the editorial decisions on entry placement. Also, The
Directory does seem to have a great many small, regional organizations and
publications.

If it is important for your library to have the most comprehensive
collection of this type of information in print, then this volume is a
necessary addition to your collection. If you have a limited budget and can
only purchase one title, I'd have to stick with the Gale publication.

IDG COMMUNCIATIONS TO ENTER ROMANIAN MARKET

International Data Group (Boston, MA) has established the
first computer publication in Romania. The company said
that "InfoClub" magazine will be published six times a year
and will have an initial circulation of 60,000. IDG said
that it will publish the magazine in association with
Stiinta si Technica Publishing Company (Bucharest), the
largest technical publishing company in Romania.

IDG chairman patrick McGovern, who recently returned from
Romania after negotiating with Stiinta si Technica, said
that Romanians spent over $105 million in 1990 to acquire
computer hardware, software and services and that "in 1991,
we expect the (Romanian) market to increase 35% to over
$140 million." He said that the "vast majority of this
amount will be for imported equipment, providing an
attractive market for the world computer industry."

"InfoClub" chief editor Ioan Albescu said that Romania had
about 60,000 computers presently installed and that he
expected that amount to increase substantially. He said
that the country needs both computers and communications
technology to provide for its economic development under
the new economic and political systems.

According to Albescu, half of the editorial content of the
start-up will be devoted to IBM-compatible personal
computers, with the remainder covering the technology and
applications of other computer companies. Because it will
be the only computer publication in the country, he said
that editorial dealing with mainframes and minicomputers
will also be included.

IDG also publishes computer magazines in Hungary, Poland,
Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.

managers, corporate counsel, government regulators, state
and local administrators, attorneys, consultants, public
interest advocates, lobbyists, researchers and librarians.

Editorial for the newsletter includes coverage of local,
state and regional environmental developments as well as
perspective and analysis of the range of environmental
issues facing the state of California. In addition, the
letter will analyze trends in legislative and regulatory
developments, publica nd private initiatives, enforcement
actions and legal activities and their potential
implications for other parts of the country.

BNA International has begun the publication of "World
Pharmaceutical Standards Review". The monthly newsletter is
designed to "fill the increasing need for in-depth analysis
of the worldwide regulatory, legal and technical
developments affecting" the pharmaceutical industry. It is
being marketed to those in government, international
organizations, industry and business, research groups, law
firms and libraries.

BNA said that editorial for the letter will include
information on health and safety standards, testing and
certification, product authorization, research, patents,
biotechnology, packaging, labeling, marketing, liability,
import/export issues and national and international
government actions. It will include coverage of countries
within the European Community, particularly in light of the
economic integration sought by 1992, the U.S., Japan and
elsewhere.

BNA ceo William Beltz said that research revealed that "a
need exists for a publication that analyzes trends and ties
together seemingly unconnected developments affecting the
pharmaceutical industry worldwide."

A/S/M COMMUNICATIONS TO LAUNCH "MEDIA WEEK" ON JANUARY 14

A/S/M Communications (New York) will begin the publication
of "Media Week" magazine with an issue on Jan. 14. In
OCTOBEr, A/S/M, a subsidiary of Billboard Publications Inc.
(New York), acquired the monthly "Marketing & Media
Decisions" from Act III Publishing (New York) and decided
to change title and frequency.

A/S/M said that the new weekly will cover media news and
trends. A/S/M chairman John Thomas, Jr. said that "we will
now publish three different weeklies ("Adweek," "Adweek's
Marketing Week" and "Media Week"), each one tailored for
its audience." He said that the three publications give
readers the magazines they need. "We'll be offering
advertisers the best general coverage among agencies and
clients, plus highly targeted coverage at the media
departments of every top agency."

Newly appointed publisher Lawrence Oliver said that "never
before have people had to keep up with so many aspects of
the media business as they do today." The new launch "will
be able to keep on top of the latest developments. The news
value of the publication is going to hinge on timeliness.
The big change in the marketplace today is the number of
alternative types of media that can be bought. It's a lot
to keep up on."

Oliver said that the publication will be targeted to media
executives at all levels at ad agencies.

A/S/M became a subsidiary of BPI Communications in July of
this year. BPI also publishes a number of media properties,
including "Billboard," "Back Stage" and "American Film"
magazines.

GRO COM GROUP TO LAUNCH "DELI-BAKE ADVOCATE" IN JUNE

Gro Com Group (Clearwater, FL) will begin the publication
of "Deli-Bake Advocate" with an issue in June. The new
magazine will be published six times a year and will have
an initial controlled circulation of 15,000. The first
issue will debut at the International Dairy-Deli
Association in Anaheim (CA).

According to co-publisher Mark Weeks, the publication will
link buyers and sellers "in an effective and affordable
manner." He said that the magazine will serve as an
important forum for companies who are "serious about
profiting from the rapidly growing deli-bake industry."

The company said the publication will be targeted as an
informational and marketing tool to deli-bake managers,
distributors and brokers. Weeks said that the circulation
list has been drawn from such sources as the International
Dairy-Deli Association, the Retail Bakers of
America/International Deli-Bake Association and verified
and qualified yellow page directories.

Weeks said he hoped that circulation will grow each year to
accomodate the demands of the industry. He said the
circulation is ultimately expected to reach between 30,000
and 40,000.

Editorial for the publication will cover ideas for
merchandising and promotion, industry trends, category
updates from industry experts, legal issues involved in
importing and exporting meats and cheeses, safety,
strategies and new products.

The company had originally planned to launch the
publication in January. The delay till June is due to
"advertising softness," Weeks said. Gro Com also publishes
"Food Distribution Magazine."

"MACPREPRESS" FAX NEWSLETTER FROM PREPRESS INFO SERVICE

Prepress Information Service (Westport, CT) has begun the
publication of "MacPrePress" newsletter. Published 48 times
a year, a subscription delivered by facsimile machine costs
$295. The letter is sent every Monday morning to
subscribers via fax.

The publication is targeted mainly to service bureaus,
vendors, printers and graphic designers. The company said
that editorial contains "all the news that matters on
Mac-based off-the- shelf prepress technology" and is
especially concerned with Mac-based PostScript page
preparation and imagesetters. Coverage of graphic software,
digital type libraries and high- resolution output devices,
bug lists for new and updated programs and reports from
users are also included.

The four-page publication "doesn't cover everything that
comes down the pike," co-publisher Kathleen Tinkel said,
only those items deemed sufficiently relevent.

The company said that it wanted to see that the legitimate
complaints of users were documented without appearing to be
engaged in "vendor bashing." The purpose of the publication
is to correct mistakes and to show what is successful, the
company said.

GRALLA PUBLICATIONS LAUNCHES "CORPORATE TRAVEL'S STRATEGIC
MEETINGS"

Gralla Publications (New York), a subsidiary of United
Newspapers (London), has begun the publication of

"Strategic Meetings" as a supplement to the company's
"Corporate Travel" magazine.

"Corporate Travel" is a monthly with a controlled
circulation of 46,000. Gralla said that the new supplement
will fill the gap between the meeting planning and
management training markets. The company said that
editorial for the publication focuses on the results of
corporate meetings and how those results could have been
different. Gralla said that special attention is being paid
to elements of group interaction within the meetings. The
publication will have "more of a management focus" than
other publications in the field, Gralla said.

The publication is being targeted to ceo's, presidents,
vice presidents and other corporate executives involved in
the meetings process. The publication will analyze factors
involved in a "good" meeting, including objectives, advance
preparation, agendas and results. Saying that most meetings
magazines talk about the logistics of meetings, Gralla said
that the new supplement will present information that
non-meeting executives can understand and act on.

Gralla said that it hoped to spin-off the publication
within the next year.

The supplement continues Gralla's recent expansion
activities. In April of this year, the company began the
publication of "V.I.P." magazine. In May, Gralla purchased
"Action Sports Retailer," "Outdoor Retailer" and two trade
shows from Pacifica Publishing. In August, the company
acquired "Wall Street Computer Review," "Insurance Software
Review," "Computer's in Banking" and "Communications in
Finance" from Investment Dealers' Digest. Also, Gralla will
begin the publication of "Gifts & Stationary Business" in
March 1991 and Sports Vision in January.

EDGELL FINDS BUYERS FOR SIX OF SEVEN PUBLICATIONS

Edgell Communications (Cleveland, OH) has found buyers for
six of the seven publications that it had put up for sale
in October. Because most of the deals have not yet been
closed, Edgell would identify only one of those buyers. In
addition, the company said that it was ceasing publication
of "Housewares" magazine after its December 15 issue.

The seven publications put up for sale include "Aqua,"
"Bicycle Dealer Showcase," "Petroleum Engineer
International," "Pipeline & Gas Journal," "World
Cogeneration," "Corporate Meetings & Incentives" and
"Communciations News."

Edgell spokesperson Mary Abood said that the company had
found buyers for all of the publications except "World
Cogeneration." She said that because most of deals would
not be finalized until after the new year, she could only
identify one buyer. Abood said The Laux Company (Maynard,
MA) had reached an agreement in principle to acquire
"Corporate Meetings & Incentives." Terms of the deal were
not revealed, but "TBP" estimates that the sale price was
about $1.7 million.

The Laux Company president Dean Laux said the purchase
allows "us to offer the largest circulation in existence
among meetings and travel executives. We see (the magazine)
becoming the flagship of our...group of publications for
the meetings and travel industry." The Laux Company also

publishes "Medical Meetings," "Insurance Conference
Planner," "Association Meetings" and "Religious Conference
Manager." "Corporate Meetings & Incentives" had estimated
1989 advertising revenues of $2 million, an increase of 5%
over the $1.9 million recorded in 1988.

Laux said that he plans no changes in staffing or location
(New York) for the magazine. The monthly has a controlled
circulation of 40,000.

"Housewares" was published 22 times a year and was targeted
to housewares merchandise managers, buyers and chain store
management personnel. Most of the editorial covered
merchandising ideas and retail strategies. It had a
controlled circulation of 13,000.

K-III CONFIRMS REPORTS OF INTEREST IN FIELD PUBLICATIONS

K-III Holdings (New York) has confirmed that it is in
negotiations for the acquisition of Field Publications
(Chicago, IL).

The proposed sale includes Field's book clubs, "Weekly
Reader" and other classroom periodicals and its Funk &
Wagnalls reference book unit. The "Weekly Reader" has a
circulation of about 10 million. The companies involved had
combined sales of about $300 million last year. It is
estimated that the purchase price will be around $250
million.

A major part of Field's business comes from licensing deals
with Walt Disney Co. However, Disney has announced that it
will soon organize its own children's book publishing
operation as soon as the current licensing Field has
terminated.

K-III currently owns some specialty book clubs and business
and professional magazines. The company acquired Reader's
Garden, Inc. last August. It added that property to its
Newbridge Communications division and made known its desire
for further acquisitions.

ACT III PUBLISHING CEASES PUBLICATION OF "CHANNELS"
MAGAZINE

Act III Publishing (New York), a subsidiary of Act III
Communications (Los Angeles), has ceased the publication of
"Channels" magazine. The company said that a suitable buyer
for the magazine could not be found.

The publication had a mostly-controlled circulation of
26,000. In an attempt to increase circulation earlier this
year, frequency for the publication was increased from 12
times to 24 times a year.

Taglined "the business of communication," the 10-year-old
magazine was targeted to television professionals as well
as lawyers, financial experts and advertisers. Editorial
provided business coverage of the electronic media,
television, cable, syndication and finance, in addition to
analyses, news of industry trends and profiles.

For the first six months of 1990, "Channels" had estimated
advertising revenues of $1.4 million, an increase of about
40% over the $1 million recorded during the first six
months of 1989. Estimated advertising pages for the period
increased 16%, going from 259 pages in 1989 to 301 pages
for 1990.

The magazine was purchased by C.C. Publishing, Act III's
percursor, in 1985 from Media Commentary Council (New
York). At that time it was a non-profit publication.

The demise of Channels continues Act III's decision to
divest itself of its business and professional magazine
properties. In September of this year, Act III ceased the
publication of both "BME's Television Engineering" and
"Corporate Video Decisions" and sold their circulation
lists to PSN Publications (New York). In October, the
company sold "Marketing & Media Decisions" to BPI
Communications (New York) and also ceased publication of
the six-month-old "The Marketer."

Act III also publishes "Mix" and "Electronic Musician"
magazines as well as "Biz News" newsletter.

WEST PUBLISHING INSTITUTES DIRECT ACCESS TO DIALOG
DATABASES

West Publishing Co. (St. Paul, MN) said that, beginning in
early 1991, a new interface will enable Westlaw legal
information service subscribers to access Dialog (Palo
Alto, CA) databases via the Westlaw directory and using
Westlaw commands. Dialog is a unit of Knight-Ridder.

The new arrangemenet supercedes, but does not replace, a
gateway previously established between the two companies
that required users to enter and use Dialog commands. The
new arrangement will provide Westlaw subscribers access to
140 Dialog databases, about one-third of Dialog's total.
The companies said that additional Dialog databases will be
added every month until all 380 are available, probably be
the end of 1991.

West president Dwight Opperman said that the dealw as
important because "law firms, coroporate legal departments,
and other users of computer- assisted legal research have
found it increasingly important to access news, business,
technical, and other information in addition to traditional
legal research." Access to Dialog "will enable legal
professionals to increase their efficiency."

The new gateway works only one way. Subscribers to Dialog
will not be able to access West databases. The companies
said that if a need for a two-way gateway is identified,
they will consider its implementation.

THE SCIENCE OF ALLIANCE

Nowhere are partnerships more important in the broadcasting industry
than in Asia. And within Asia no market is considered to be hotter
property for cable and satellite right now than India and the
Subcontinent.

A population of 900 million that supports a middle class of 250
million, coupled with 14,000 cabled homes and rising, are figures not
to be sniffed at by western broadcasters looking to extend their brands
into the Far East.

But in a pioneer market, no amount of high production values or honed
channel images and marketing campaigns will ensure that signals reach
cable operators, that cable operators relay them to households and
that, in the case of the pay-TV channels at least, subscription
revenues find their way back into the right pockets. India is no
exception.

Although of all the channels targeting that region, ESPN and Disney
have arguably the sort of programming that will pretty much translate
anywhere, their respective alliances with the Modi Group is a smart
one. A diversified conglomerate, Modi's foray into entertainment -
although still fledgling - is comprehensive. Offering its partners
everything from production possibilities, distribution networks,
subscriber management and revenue collection, Modi is a one-stop shop
and a grass-roots partnership. In return, the Indian company can expect
to receive the Western broadcasting know-how it presently lacks. But
with a collective turnover of $2 billion plus a year, knowledge is all
the Modis are likely to require and that may only be in the short term.
Its high-profile alliance with Disney may also put it out of reach of
others: zealously protective of its brand, Disney is likely to be
precious as to who else it allows to join its Indian stable.

The Modi-Disney-ESPN hook up is only one of several big Asian deals
that have been cemented over recent months. Partnerships and global
alliances are increasingly become the way forward in Asia. But
remaining available opportunities will, and are narrowing.

SIX MONTH INVESTIGATION INTO FAILURE OF APSTAR 2

China Great Wall Industry Corp. and Hughes Space and Communications
have concluded their six month investigation into the failure of Apstar
2, which exploded in January,  seconds after take off via a Long March
rocket. The failure has been put down to wind shear which damaged
either the satellite or the rocket. As yet there is no set date for the
launch of Asiasat 2, which is also set to go up via a Long March rocket
before the end of the year.

NBC ASIA AND NBC SUPER CHANNEL ASIA DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

Both NBC Asia and NBC Super Channel Asia are to be distributed in
Indonesia as part of Star TV's multi channel pay-TV package designed
specifically for the Indonesian market. Broadcasting off Asiasat 2, the
service will be available in early 1996 and will be distributed by the
Indovision Group, the only company licensed to collect pay-TV revenue
in the archipelago. The U.S. network has also announced distribution in
two other countries. Following an agreement signed with distributor
Cable Boss, NBC Asia will be available to cable TV subscribers in the
Philippines. While in Taiwan, the news and current affairs channel will
work together with Liann Yee Production Co who will not only handle the
distribution for NBC Asia but will also work to adapt some of its
programming specifically for the Taiwan market. The agreement in Taiwan
also applies to NBC Super Channel Asia when it launches, probably in
early 1996.

68.5 degrees east it will commence its service in September. With a
footprint that also covers parts of Africa, Europe and the Middle East,
Pas-4 is expected to be the `hot bird' for Asia and in particular the
Indian subcontinent. The satellite already has 14 customers including
China Central Television, Disney, ESPN, HBO Asia, Sony, Turner
Broadcasting and Viacom International.

KOREASAT 1 LAUNCHED

South Korea's first domestic satellite, Koreasat 1, launched in August
from the Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on board a
McDonnell Douglas Delta 2 rocket. However, a low performance by the
rocket in its first stage left the satellite in a lower than desired
orbit. Koreasat 1 which was supposed to have been placed into an oval
orbit with a high point 22,200 miles above the earth, missed its mark
by about 3,800 miles. According to McDonnell Douglas, the satellite
will be able to use its onboard thrusters to correct the altitude
deficit, but will have to sacrifice some of its expected 10 year life.
The satellite's 12 KU-band transponders had been earmarked for the
delivery of direct broadcasting, fixed telecommunications and
electronic data throughout the Korean Peninsula.

PAY-TV LICENSING CHANGES

Thai broadcasting authority the Public Relations Department (PRD) is
expected to make changes to its system for pay-TV licensing. Currently
the PRD simply charges Baht 25,000 ($1,000) for a licence, however
director general Arun Ngamdee admitted the rules need to be adjusted.
It is possible they will be changed to mirror the Mass Communication
Organisation of Thailand (MCOT)'s licensing policy. MCOT, the only
other Thai body authorised to give out pay-TV licences, takes an equity
stake in each incumbent.

PASSAGE TO INDIA

The Modi Group dominates India's broadcasting industry. Anil Wanvari
profiles the diversified company, which, through a combination of
market-savvy and strategic alliances, has left its competitors standing

It all started as a twinkle in a little boy's eye. Lalit Modi, a scion
of the multi-billion dollar Indian Modi group, was bowled over by the
delights of Disney comics and movies. As he grew into college and went
to the U.S. to study management, the twinkle turned into admiration for
the company responsible for pioneering the animated feature film. Then
admiration turned to ambition, he too would set up an entertainment
empire... in India.

Today Lalit Modi, 32, is well on the way to achieving that ambition. As
president and managing director of the Modi Entertainment Group (MEG),
he is piecing together an outfit that may well become the most
integrated entertainment business in India and has made several matches
with global entertainment leaders, including Disney, ESPN, U.S producer-
distributors New World Entertainment and Multimedia Entertainment, and
theatrical conglomerate United Artists, to distribute and market their
product in Asia's most dynamic broadcasting market. Other high-calibre
deals incorporating programme production, channel distribution and even
publishing are sitting on the table.

Being part of a large Marwari - a community known for its financial
acumen and entrepreneuralism - probably made things easier for Modi as
he didn't have to scout around for start-up capital.

Started by his grandfather, Gujar Mal Modi in 1933, the Modi group is
today involved in a whole series of activities from manufacturing
through service industries like telecommunications and oil and gas
exploration. It boasts a collective turnover of $2 billion-plus. In
fact, the Modis even have a township named after them - Modinagar.

However, the group is not exactly a cohesive whole as it has split into
factions, each represented by one of Gujar Mal Modi's sons. The
splinter that has spawned the entertainment arm is the $300 million
diversified Krishan Kumar Modi company, run by Lalit's father, KK Modi.
With fingers in numerous pies from the manufacturing of cosmetics for
Estee Lauder and cigarettes in partnership with Philip Morris, to tea
retailing via the

Tea City outlet, KK Modi's flagship companies include Godfrey Philips
(cigarettes and the tea), Indofil Chemicals, (fertilisers to
polyester), Modern Home Care (household products) and, of course, the
entertainment concerns, which are just taking shape.

"The reasons for getting into entertainment were clear," says Lalit
Modi. "No large company has looked at it as a serious business [in
India] and hence there was an opportunity to corporatise it. It [the
market] consisted of mom and pop-type operators with thousands of
players, all of them small. The reasons for our entering TV were that a
boom was inevitable. There was just a single channel but restrictions
were being lifted which would change this. Entertainment is the
backbone of Indians. We had the infrastructure, marketing and brand-
building savvy and were ideally positioned to make a go of it."

What makes the Modis different from other Indian groups looking at
entering the entertainment industry is the group's broad perspective
and ambition. Lalit Modi believes in using a network of companies to
straddle every segment of the entertainment business.

"I want the Modi Entertainment Group to be in every aspect of
entertainment. I want to attack on all fronts - production,
distribution and cinema exhibition, accompanied by merchandising. In TV
I want the integration [created by] having a satellite channel,
software production [facilities], distribution and marketing," Modi
explains. "An entertainment product should be bought for every possible
window - pay-TV, free-TV, cable, you name it. I expect the linkages
that I am now forging between the various elements of entertainment to
generate 40% to 50% savings."

Indeed, neither the Hindujas, Zee TV or Business India TV can boast
portfolios as large as the Modi Group, as all three focus on one, two,
or at the most three different facets of the entertainment business.
Zee is involved in software production, runs three satellite channels,
operates an amusement park and produces films and music. The Hindujas
are at present only involved in cable TV but have intentions to expand
into publishing, satellite TV, movie production, multiplexes and
entertainment parks.

As yet the Modi Entertainment Group has not diversified into amusement
parks, the music business or radio, but no one would be surprised if it
didn't make a foray into each of these in the future. "Let the policies
become clearer," says executive director Rajiv Sahai.

Lalit Modi believes life in the entertainment lane is just starting.
"By the time this article comes out I'll have struck a few more deals,"
he says. "Currently I am looking at direct-to-home in a big way, but so
are several others like [PanAmSat via] PAS-4, Hughes, and Rupert
Murdoch. For all you know, I may tie up with one of them at some stage.
I have allocated $200 to $300 million to be invested in entertainment
over the next three years. I'd like the group to be a major force in
the Indian marketplace. So far we have delivered. Time will tell
whether we'll succeed."

MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN

The Modi Group's market knowledge and financial acumen has attracted
the attention of the world's leading entertainment companies, writes
Anil Wanvari

The essence of the Modi Entertainment Group lies in the number of
global alliances CEO Lalit Modi has created. However, this is in-
keeping with the company's overall philosophy. Founder Gujar Mal Modi
once said when you don't have certain know-how you should take it from
a foreign company. And grandson Lalit is certainly following that
advice.

"We have 42 joint ventures in the Modi group as a whole. As far as
entertainment goes we knew we wanted to get in but we didn't understand
it. It was a new business for India and we didn't have the technology,
whereas the foreign partner did," he explains.

So far Modi has surrendered a majority (51%) stake in the Disney joint
venture, which has already spawned two subsidiaries, and has given away
50% in three of its other six entertainment companies.

"Thanks to these partnerships we've got faster to market and in turn
have given them our understanding of the Indian market and
infrastructure," he says.

Modi's first chance at an entertainment partnership came in 1993 when
the conglomerate inked a deal with Walt Disney to set-up Walt Disney
(India). "Disney had just completed a licence agreement with a small
Indian company and approached us, among several other companies, for a
tie-up," recalls Lalit Modi. "We pursued them with great motivation, we
were prepared to take on losses for some time and put in a great deal
of effort behind building up the business. All this is probably what
drove us together."

Formed to act as a vehicle for further Disney investments in India, the
joint venture soon spawned its first wholly-owned subsidiary: Walt
Disney Consumer Products (India) to look after the merchandising and
licensing of Disney products.

So far Walt Disney Consumer Products (India) has finalised licensing
deals with about 42 Indian companies.

Walt Disney (India's) second venture, Buena Visa Television (India),
was set-up to take responsibility for programme distribution and
marketing, with access to the huge library of series, animation shorts,
educational software and films from the animated giant and other
affiliated studios such as Hollywood Pictures, Touchstone, Caravan and
Miramax.

"Their professionalism and their commitment to quality encouraged us to
take them on as partners," says Disney's Hong Kong-based marketing and
communications manager, Rose Leng. "We saw eye-to-eye. They also enjoy
a unique relationship with Doordarshan."

Modi's relationship with the state-owned broadcaster has not only
helped Doordarshan fight the onslaught of foreign satellite channels
like Star TV, but has succeeded in reaping rewards all round: Today
Disney shows are broadcast on both DDI and DDII and, for Buena Vista TV
itself, such deals have contributed towards revenues which reached Rs52
million ($14 million) in 1994, of which Rs14.8 million was profit.

Close on the heels of the Buena Vista TV formation, Modi also signed
deals for the rights to distribute Disney films to India, Sri Lanka,
Nepal and Bangladesh under the guise of Modi Films, another 100% Modi-
owned company.

And, although movie-going in India has been on the wane, Modi
Entertainment is trying to change that. Via a 50/50 joint venture with
United Artists Theatre Circuit, the company is looking at setting up
multiplex theatre chains in all the major metros, at a cost of Rs150 to
Rs200 per site.

Another 100%-owned venture, Home Communications, has also been actively
acquiring the rights to TV software, including 300 Hindi film titles
and a few overseas English productions. Home Communications is also
looking at co-producing programming for television, the fruits of which
will be sold to broadcasters including Modi's joint venture Disney
Channel.

For Modi, software opportunities lead naturally to channel
opportunities and greater returns. But only if the right revenue
streams are tapped. "Advertising in India is not growing fast enough to
sustain the explosion in free-to-air channels," says Lalit Modi. "So I
was convinced the key to the Indian TV market would be distribution,
and via the pay-TV route."

And that is where his next venture, Modi Entertainment Network (MEN),
comes in. Headed by marketing veteran Tony D'Siliva, MEN is relying on
Modi's existing network of 2000 salesmen and 50 national distributors
to get into the cable TV distribution and subscriber management
businesses, albeit in a rather unique way.

Says Lalit Modi: "Most of the distributors have children who have come
of age and are looking for new businesses to enter. They are respected
in their towns and have influence. I'm offering the children the option
to manage collections for pay-TV from operators and service them and
distribute decoders."

The distributors are expected to set-up separate outfits with their
servicing field force and will work in conjunction with a dedicated MEN
staff of 150 to collect subscriptions revenue. Modi group salesmen will
conduct household audits to confirm whether the satellite feed is
actually being retransmitted by the cable operator. D'Silva expects MEN
to be involved in 100 cities by the end of Year One.

Such efforts seem to be already bearing fruit: in December 1994
sportscaster ESPN signed MEN to be its exclusive Indian distributor.

"There are few companies in India that know as much about the media
business as these guys," says ESPN Asia managing director Sandy Brown.

Brown says Modi will be involved in all facets of the channel's
distribution and operation from the distribution of decoders to the
subscriber management and revenue collection. And although ESPN is
currently doing all the customisation of the channel itself - it is
providing between eight to 12 hours of dubbed Hindi-language
programming a day, in addition to producing local wrap-arounds - Brown
says he isn't ruling out Modi getting involved in the production
process itself.

ESPN is keen to test the market for pay-TV in India. Set to launch in
mid-October, the ESPN India channel will be one of only two pay-TV
services targeting the Subcontinent, the first being Star Movies.
However, at the time of writing, the two companies have had to change
tack, having made the decision to offer the service free-to-air for a
short while as a promotional ploy.

Lalit Modi says this is a deliberate strategy: "I'd like cable
operators and viewers to get a taste of the quality of programming ESPN
can provide," he says. "Once they become aware, I'm sure they'll be
willing to pay for it."

But observers say the company hasn't managed to get its pay-TV
management act together and has failed to get enough cable operators on
its side, in addition to falling short with the required number of
decoders. The truth may lie somewhere in between. Indian cable
operators are averse to coughing up cash for decoders and don't like to
reveal their true subscriber bases due to heavy government levies.

ESPN's Brown is not unrealistic about the task ahead. "Collecting the
revenue is not going to be an easy task, the operators are not used to
paying for services and their sheer number and distance apart will make
things difficult. But if anyone has got the distribution network to
pull it off it is the Modis."

Lalit Modi is also unperturbed: "The decoders are not the problem. We
have everything in place, but we will only go ahead when the timing is
right," adding that MEN is pursuing further deals with other
broadcasters for pay-TV distribution.

The efforts may well be worth while as indications point to big
returns. If MEN can persuade even five million of India's 15 million
cable homes to pay Rs5 a month, the numbers will work out at Rs300
million a year. And that's just for starters, reckons Modi.

What may be some time off, however, is the widely-speculated Modi-
Disney pay-TV movie channel, to be delivered via PAS-4. According to
Disney's Rose Leng, the entertainment conglomerate has no immediate
plans for India. "India is just one of several Asian markets we are
examining. We have to find the right programming format and partners,"
she says. "We'll just leave the transponder that we have booked there;
we are not going to rush in."

The explanation from the Modi side is that the satellite channel has
been delayed because the group is still doing research into the Indian
market. "We are reviewing the possibilities together, we can't afford
to make mistakes," says Lalit Modi. "The viewer gives you only one
chance in the TV business."

Modi's ability and willingness to carefully research its market is an
attribute that attracted the attention of New World Entertainment, one
of two U.S companies with which Modi has set-up shared equity ventures,
the other being Multimedia Enterprises.

"Research into the TV viewer has been spotty in India in terms of both
quantitative and qualitative research," says New World's John Cuddihy.
"But the Modis have gone out on their own and produced some excellent-
quality research we have access to."

The purpose of New World Modi (India) is to create opportunities in the
TV business on a number of fronts in which distribution of the existing
catalogue, original production and channel development are all being
evaluated. However, Cuddihy says that of them all, channel development
is probably of least interest. "Although we wouldn't necessarily turn
our backs on a situation that included hardware, our mandate in India
at the moment is to work on the software," he says. Currently, Modi-New
World India has taken slots on DDII for the long-running soap Valley of
The Dolls, which is being stripped five times a week.

According to Ethan Podell, executive vice-president of Multimedia
Enterprises, his company approached Modi for a partnership: "The group
is a sophisticated business entity. They have a good grasp of the media
business."

Podell envisages the venture producing U.S-style talk shows for the
Indian market, albeit with a local focus. Work on one daytime show has
already started and should be ready in the next six months.

"We don't know how long it's going to take to make money in the Indian
market but all our markets are revenue-driven," says Podell. "We are
optimistic."

And that's exactly what has made Modi Entertainment Group the darling
of the western media world. Says Lalit Modi: "When we were discussing
with Disney, we were willing to work their way and we were motivated
and persevering. For every venture we had to approach them afresh. In
some of the ventures I'm aware we will take four years to break even;
in some we are already making profits. I have a vision: that the Modi
Entertainment Group is to emerge as a major player in the Indian
market."

LAWS UNTO THEMSELVES

The second part of Cable & Satellite Asia's A-Z guide to regulation. By
Janine Stein

Korea

Regulatory bodies and laws: Since December 1994, the licensing
authority has been the Ministry of Information and Communications
(MOIC). The previous authority, the

Ministry of Information (MOI), now makes recommendations to the MOIC.
All cable companies are required to join the Korean Cable Television
Association (KCTA). Programming standards and practices are set by the
Korean Cable Communications Commission (KCCC). Laws governing
television include the Telecommunications Business Law, the Cable TV
Law, the Satellite Communications Law (draft) and the Satellite
Broadcasting Law (draft). Satellite laws are being drafted to deal with
the use of satellites after the launch of KoreaSat.

Uplink/downlink: No company is allowed to establish uplink or downlink
facilities except for Korea Telecom (KT) and DACOM. Uplink/downlink
agreements between cable network service-providers and foreign
satellite operators have to be rubber-stamped by the Ministry of
Information and Communication.

Foriegn ownership/cross media ownership: The government has adopted a
tripartite framework for cable TV. This consists of system operators
(defined geographically), programmers (defined by genre) and signal
transporting providers (network operators). Cross-ownership among the
three is prohibited by the Cable TV Law. Foreign companies and large
domestic business conglomerates, such as Hyundai, Samsung and Daewoo,
are supposedly prohibited from participating in system operating and
signal transporting, although they are heavily involved indirectly.
Foreign investment is limited to 15% in the TV programmers category.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: The Copyright Law
protects foreign broadcasts and cable retransmissions.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Advertising time can be no longer
than 10 minutes per hour, with a maximum of six minutes per hour on the
children's channel. Programmes cannot be interrupted by advertising
more than four times in two hours, and ad breaks, depending where they
fall in the schedule, are regulated in terms of length and content.

Reception and distribution rules: Private satellite TV reception is
officially banned. This will change with the launch of KoreaSat though.

Programming rules and content restrictions: Cable TV channels have
strict foreign content restrictions, varying from 10% for arts and
culture, and 20% for educational programming, to 50% for science and
technology and documentaries. Movies, foreign programming, cartoons and
commercials have to adhere to certain content standards.

4929; Korean Cable TV Association, Tel: 82 2 735 6511, Fax: 82 2 735-
6514

Malaysia

Regulatory bodies and laws: Ministry of Energy, Telecoms and Posts,
Ministry of Information. The power to grant broadcasting licences lies
with the Ministry of Information. Regulations regarding satellite
services are contained in the Telecommunications Act of 1950 and the
Broadcasting Act of 1988. Malaysia's legislation is being amended in
response to new technological advancements such as uplinking services
and public reception of satellite broadcast signals.

Uplink/downlink: Uplinking is possible through the Telecommunications
Department. This restriction will be revised under the new regulations.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: The 1974 guidelines require
foreign individuals acquiring 15% or more of voting powers, or groups
acquiring 30% or more, to apply for permission from the Foreign
Investment Committee (FIC). Alternatively, if the acquisition by
foreign interests in a Malaysian company is worth more than $M5 million
($2 million), irrespective of percentage, companies will require the
approval of the FIC. There is no separate defined policy for the
telecommunications sector, although there are expectations that the
development of cable and satellite networks by foreign companies will
require joint ventures with local companies. There are currently no
specific rules on cross-media ownership.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: Broadcasts are governed
by the Copyright Act of 1987. The material must be original, first
published in Malaysia, or broadcast from Malaysia. With some
exceptions, broadcasts from outside Malaysia are not entitled to
protection.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Details of requirements on cable
are not yet confirmed. There are severe restrictions on the content and
production of advertisements.

Reception and distribution rules: Dishes were banned in 1992 to prevent
Malaysia receiving unsuitable foreign channels. This ruling is expected
to be overturned when amendments to the broadcasting and
telecommunications acts are tabled before Parliament this year.

Programming rules and content restrictions: The Malaysian government is
softening its hard-line attitude towards foreign programming. The
Ministry Of Information is conducting a study to determine the kind of
programmes suitable for television, video-tapes and cinemas. It will
also look into a rating system and a broadcasting code of ethics.

Contact: Ministry of Information. Tel: 60 3 757 8988; Rashid & Lee
Lawyers, Tel: 60 3 293 8155

Philippines

Regulatory bodies and laws: The regulatory bodies are the Department of
Transport and Communications, the National Telecommunications
Commission (NTC), and the Kapisnan ng mga Brodkaster (KBP). Cable
regulations are works-in-progress at the moment. Main industry body,
the Philippine Cable Television Association, is expected to shortly
submit its recommendations to the government.

Uplink/downlink: Licences to establish uplinking facilities are issued
by the NTC. Various construction and equipment permits are also
required. However companies have to prove the current facilities
provided by the satellite communications service-providers do not not
meet their requirements. Foreign broadcasters do not require permits to
downlink to cable operators, providing the signals do not originate in
the Philippines.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: Under current regulations,
foreign investment in the cable industry - classified as broadcast
media - is not allowed. Reclassification is expected to take place this
year. If reclassified as telecommunications, the foreign investment
ceiling will be 40%. There is a possibility cable may be classified and
regulated separately with a 30% ceiling on foreign investment. There
are foreign ownership restrictions on the ownership of uplink
facilities too.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: Piracy is a problem,
although efforts are being made to encourage cable operators to adhere
to rules. But fines for offenders are low. Many cable systems are video-
driven, using unlicensed tapes and unauthorised retransmission of taped
satellite programmes.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Except for institutional
advertising, cable TV is not officially allowed to carry advertising.
In reality, cable operators are carrying up to four minutes of ads per
hour. In return for carrying institutional ads, cable operators are
awarded tax credits.

Reception and distribution rules: None

Programming rules and content restrictions: The Philippines has no
restrictions on foreign programming content. Cable operators rely on
acquired programming because they aren't supposed to produce their own.
Cable operators are obliged to carry the terrestrial broadcasters.

Contact: National Telecommunications Commission, Tel: 63 2 924 3744.
Fax: 63 2 921 7128.

Singapore

Regulatory bodies and laws: The Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA)
is a statutory authority under the Ministry of Information and the
Arts, which regulates and licenses the broadcasting industry in
Singapore. Broadcasting services are governed by the Singapore
Broadcasting Act 1994. Video-on-demand is classified as a broadcasting
service and is subject to SBA licensing requirements. The SBA is
responsible for regulating broadcasting services content. The
Telecommunications Authority Of Singapore (TAS) is responsible for
regulating broadcasting delivery systems.

Uplink/downlink: To uplink satellite signals from Singapore,
broadcasters need a satellite broadcasting licence issued by the SBA.
Broadcasters who want to operate their own uplink facilities need a
licence issued by the TAS. To be granted a satellite broadcasting
licence, broadcasters have to ensure their service is acceptable and
complies with local laws in recipient countries. Once satisfied, the
SBA will give its approval in principle within two weeks. The actual
licence takes a month to issue. There are several incentive schemes,
such as the Pioneer Status scheme, granted to broadcasters who choose
Singapore as their base. These are incentive tax packages based on the
type of activity and amount of investment made. Satellite broadcasters
can uplink their services through a common carrier like Singapore
Telecom, SIMCOM, or ST Teleport. They can also operate their own uplink
facilities either individually or in joint-ownership with other
broadcasters.

Foreign/cross media ownership restrictions: None

Intellectual property and copyright protection: A number of laws
protect intellectual property. These include the Copyright Act, the
Trademarks Act and the Patent Act. Cable operators have to obtain
copyright authorisation for programming.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Cable advertising is restricted to
14 minutes per hour. There are no restrictions on satellite
advertising.

Reception and distribution rules: Private dish installation and usage
is banned. Businesses can apply to the SBA to receive DTH services.

Programming rules and content restrictions: There are no language or
foreign programme restrictions on cable or satellite TV. The cable TV
system is required to carry the local terrestrial channels on its
network.

Contact: Singapore Broadcasting Authority, Directorate of Policy and
Planning, Tel: 65 373 0803 Fax: 65 278 6009

Taiwan

Regulatory bodies and laws: Regulatory bodies are the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications and the Government Information Office
(GIO). Revisions to the Broadcasting and Television Law are pending.
Taiwan's first Cable TV Law was passed in 1993.

Uplink/downlink: Foreign broadcasters are not allowed to uplink from
Taiwan. This could change under the new legislation.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: Draft regulations may allow
49% foreign investment in satellite companies. Foreign investment in
cable has to be indirect.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: A new copyright law has
been drafted to bring Taiwan into line with GATT standards. The draft
law clarifies the definition of broadcast but does not specifically
address the protection of unencrypted signals. At the moment,
protection is offered to works by nationals of the U.S., Hong Kong,
Switzerland, the UK and, in certain cases, Korea and Spain.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Ads are allowed to occupy 10% of
broadcasting time on cable. There are no restrictions on satellite.

Reception and distribution rules: Broadcasts are mostly unregulated.

Programming rules and content restrictions: Content guidelines are very
general, mainly for the protection of children. There are no language
restrictions. 20% of the cable programming mix has to be locally-
produced. The GIO is planning a Satellite Broadcast Law which will give
it authority to control content. At the moment, the GIO uses the
Broadcasting and Television Law's provisions on programme production
and distribution. As most foreign suppliers of satellite programmes
fall beyond the reach of local authorities, there are indications that
the local authorities will attempt to control foreign programming
through cable operators carrying the programmes.

Contact: Government Information Office, Tel: 886 2 357 0020 Fax: 886 2
357-0016.

Thailand

Regulatory bodies and laws: The Broadcasting Law covers all
broadcasting in Thailand, with separate regulations for cable.
Satellite TV has no regulations of its own. The Public Relations
Department (PRD) is the broadcasting regulatory body.

Uplink/downlink: Uplink facilities require a licence under the amended
Radio and Television Act, which covers the provision of radio or
television services for the public. The licences are issued by the
Department of Posts and Telecommunications. A company establishing
uplink or downlink facilities has to be majority Thai-owned. The Alien
Business Law restricts foreign involvement in certain activities;
including operating uplinking facilities.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: Broadcasting licence
applications have to be submitted by Thai nationals with offices in
Thailand. In ordinary registered partnerships, partners must be Thai
nationals. In limited partnerships, the partner with unlimited
liability must hold Thai nationality and not less than 50% of the
company's capital must be held by Thai nationals.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: Perhaps surprisingly,
given the proliferation of pirated  goods in Thailand, foreign
broadcasts and cable retransmission of foreign broadcasts are protected
under the Thai copyright law.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Thailand's pay-TV services are not
allowed to carry advertising. Content is dictated by the PRD.

Reception and distribution rules: Private ownership of satellite dishes
is allowed. Pay-TV companies have to obtain a licence from either the
Mass Communications Organisation of Thailand (MCOT) or the PRD.

Programming rules and content restrictions: There are no foreign
programme quotas. Programmes cannot be insulting to anyone, especially
Thai Royalty, heads of state or government officials. Religion has to
be respected, as does the public order, national unity and
international relationships. Obscene and cruel footage is banned.
Foreign television production crews have to obtain official permission
to shoot in Thailand.

BIG MONEY, BIG PLANS

Malaysia's foray into cable and satellite has begun with two consortia
competing for market share. Sarah Walker reports

"We are about to make a quantum leap," said Malaysia's minister of
information about the imminent arrival to his country of pay-TV, which
will enable the 22 million-strong population to tune into around 25
channels of TV, compared to the current choice of just four. But it
will be a controlled leap. Far from heralding the beginning of an open-
skies policy, there is every sign Prime Minister Mohammed Mahathir -
concerned about the effect uncensored western satellite channels could
have on Malaysia's national culture and identity - will preside
carefully over the emergence of cable and DTH.

So far two companies have been given licences to develop a secondary
television market in Malaysia. One, Cableview Services Sdn Bhd, has
already soft-launched part of its five-channel MMDS service called Mega
TV (see box). The other, Measat Broadcast Network Services (MBNS), will
launch its 20-channel DTH service mid-1996, utilising Ku-band capacity
on the country's first domestic satellite, Measat One.

Although Cableview Services has cash-rich shareholders, its level of
investment in pay-TV comes nowhere near that being earmarked by its
satellite-delivered competitor. However, both Measat and MBNS are part
of a much wider effort to construct a modern technological
infrastructure in Malaysia. Measat is owned and operated by Binariang
Sdn Bhd, a private telecommunications company in turn owned 20% by the
U.S. Baby Bell US West and 80% by Malaysian shareholders, including the
influential business tycoon Ananda Krishnan. The Malaysian shareholders
in turn wholly own MBNS, giving it sister company status to Binariang.

Binariang itself, far from just being a satellite operator, has a
complete range of authorisations from the Malaysian government to
establish a fully-integrated, multimedia network operating under the
corporate identity name of Maxis. This includes the setting up of a
cellular phone system, the construction of fixed broadband networks
and, of course, the launching and operation of Measat.

So far two Measats have been planned and will be co-located at 91.5
degrees, although eight orbital slots have been filed in total. Measat
One will launch in December 1995, while Measat Two is tentatively
scheduled for October 1996. Both will be put into orbit by the French
launcher Arianespace.

Measat One's payload will be comprised of 12 36MHz transponders at C-
Band and five, 54MHz transponders at Ku-Band. The C-Band footprint will
cover the whole of the Asia Pacific, as far west as the east coast of
India as far south as northern Australia, north to Mongolia and east as
far as Guam. Ku-Band capacity, meanwhile, will provide spot beam
coverage over Malaysia, the Philippines and India.

Although the same model as the first craft, Measat Two is likely to be
configured differently with three 76MHz C-Bands transponders, in
addition to 12 at Ku-Band. Measat Two's Ku capacity will also be
extended to provide coverage of Java, Queensland and Vietnam.

"The satellite payload is quite flexible, we can switch transponders
between the different beams," says Maxis's Steven Corda. "We are
looking at targeting emerging countries, to be there when they require
a service," he continues. "For instance, we have one transponder that
can be switched to Vietnam, providing five to 10 channels of
programming."

Although the satellite operator and the programming arm operate as
separate entities, the commonality of ownership ensures that synergies
exist. While C-Band capacity on both satellites is available for hire,
all the Ku capacity has been leased exclusively to MBNS so that it can
provide DTH services initially to Malaysia, but potentially to all the
different regions covered by the spot beams.

For Malaysia itself, MBNS has initially been licensed to provide a 20-
channel DTH package receivable with 50cm dishes. According to Paul
Edwards, MBNS's chief operating officer, channels in the package will
be a combination of international and locally-produced services. "We
will probably have two local channels initially," says Edwards, whose
staff are now in the process of acquiring shows and commissioning local
productions. Eventually, MBNS will have the capability to produce its
own programming once construction has been completed of the Asia
Broadcast Centre, a huge facility combining production, post-production
facilities and uplinking. The centre will also enable the company to
help localise the international services, in terms of providing dubbing
and subtitling and possibly even providing local programming.

"Our experience is that local programming often drives the pay-TV
packages and that often international channels by themselves have not
always been especially successful in some markets," says Edwards. "So
we are looking at a combination of local driver channels packaged with
top-quality international channels that have an element of
localisation."

Although contracts have yet to be signed, programmers who have
confirmed they are in discussions for carriage as part of the DTH
package include the Discovery Channel, ESPN, CNNI, TNT/Cartoon Network
and Asia Business News.

With such services previously unwelcome in Malaysia, Edwards says a lot
of focus is being channelled towards the issue of censorship, "to
ensure that whatever we broadcast will be acceptable," he says. "We are
still evaluating those standards but have employed some very advanced
technology which will allow us to delay the transmission of content,
subject to the usual permissions of the programme owners."

CNNI for one will broadcast to Malaysia on a two-hour delay basis to
give local censors plenty of time to cut out any offending programme
material.

With the launch of the DTH package still some eight to 10 months off,
Edwards says negotiations are still underway with MPEG-2/DVB-compliant
compression technology suppliers. Also still being evaluated is the
pricing structure. "We are still doing research into the market as to
what acceptance levels are," he says. Although a more comprehensive
channel package, coupled with the high cost of digital decoders, is
likely to push the price up to at least twice that of Mega TV, say
industry experts.

Utilising compression rates of at least 10 to one and perhaps even
higher on each of the 17 Ku transponders provided by both Measat One
and Two, MBNS will be able to provide in the region of 150 DTH
channels, split between the satellites' several spot beams. "We will
not necessarily beam services into each of those countries but have the
capacity to do so," says Edwards. "And because the beams are switchable
to a degree we can allocate transponder capacity to certain markets as
the need arises." Although Edwards says the services could also be
delivered to cable headends as well as to the home, "the experience of
Europe and the U.S. shows that there is a very definite role for DTH."

Aside from Malaysia the first market to be targeted by MBNS is India,
where an MoU to deliver a multi-channel DTH service, in conjunction
with state broadcaster Doordarshan, has already been signed. Utilising
up to four transponders, a potential 40 channels will eventually be
available. "India has been a cable market until now but it has grown
very fast indeed and we think that going forward there will be a very
viable DTH market there," he says.

As regards the C-Band capacity on Measat One and Two, Maxis's Steven
Corda says Binariang is "looking to provide any type of fixed satellite
services you could imagine." The first will be a Vsat service scheduled
for the second quarter of next year, another will be telephony, with
long-distance learning another possibility. However one of the major
target markets will again be broadcasters, for distribution to
headends. "We are looking at both international and domestic
broadcasters," says Corda. "Say if the domestic broadcaster wanted to
make its programming available in Indonesia, or Mindanao in the
Philippines where there is a large Bahasa Malaysia-speaking
population... When you look at the coverage, we cover just about all of
Asia Pacific and the power levels are quite large, so we can run two
analogue channels per transponder at high quality, effectively doubling
the amount of programming you can see on our satellite versus some of
the others," he continues.

Corda views all the other regional satellites as Measat's direct
competition, but doesn't believe it is a major issue.

"Digital video and high-powered transponders have lowered the cost for
individual uses such that we are now getting a whole new market
segment," he says. "Now instead of just the $1.5 million to $2 million
a year for a transponder, customers can lease an eighth or a quarter,
we are now getting into the $500,000 and lower range." The cost for a
full C-Band transponder on Measat will be $1.9 million a year.

For Binariang though it is the construction of the fixed broadband
network that is seen as potentially the largest revenue-earner. The
company is to invest R$2.9 million in its development over the next
five years. So far two deals have been signed for the construction of
hybrid fibre/co-axial systems, with the aim being to capture an 8%
market share by the year 2000.

Edwards see synergies for MBNS and Binariang in this area too. "Such a
state-of-the-art system will allow for VOD and interactive
programming... we see ourselves as a content-provider," he says.

MEGA TV: NO SECOND BEST

With a population starved of choice yet relatively affluent, received
wisdom is that the time is right for pay-TV in Malaysia. But do
Malaysians need two services? The answer, according to both MBNS and
competitor Mega TV, would appear to be yes.

Although MBNS's proposed pay-TV plan is impressive, the country's
second pay-TV licensee, Mega TV, will still have an eight-month lead
over its DTH-delivered competitor, and decidedly lower overheads.

Test-launched in September with a four-channel package - comprised of
CNNI, Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel, and ESPN - Mega TV will begin
its full, five-channel service in November with the arrival of HBO
Asia. At this time viewers will be required to begin paying for the
package.

According to CEO Shamsul Khalid Ismail, the total cost of the service
includes an installation fee of R$260 ($104) to R$450, depending on the
type of property, a R$135 decoder deposit fee - the decoders are given
out free of charge, but on loan - and a monthly fee of R$45. For this,
subscribers will get four 24-hour channels, plus a fifth channel
incorporating 14-hours of the Cartoon Network, broadcasting from 08.00
to 18.00, plus locally-packaged general entertainment programming,
broadcasting from 20.00 to 01.00.

Operated by Cableview Services which in turn is owned by a consortium
of five companies, including private broadcaster TV3 (40%) and the
minister of finance (30%), Mega TV is initially targeting the wealthy
Klang Valley area of Malaysia, which incorporates Kuala Lumpur. Target
households are those with incomes exceeding $1,500 a month. And
although Mega TV is allowed to sell three minutes of commercial airtime
per hour on all channels except HBO, its main revenue is expected to
come from subscriptions.

While it is likely all of the channels distributed by Mega TV will end
up on Measat as well, Mega is playing on the cost factor. "We know
their service will be a lot more expensive," says Ismail. "They will
have to target the R$3000 a month income bracket." And by the time
Measat's DTH service is up-and-running, Mega TV will have expanded
beyond its initial coverage area.

With a nationwide licence, the plan is to expand coverage as quickly as
possible, using the same MMDS delivery. Channel capacity could also be
extended to around 12, and even more, should digital MMDS be
implemented. This, says Ismail, could render it unnecessary to invest
in other forms of delivery, such as hard wire cable, because digital
MMDS would allow compression of the existing channels.

Having invested R$110 million to date, breakeven point, says Ismail, is
50,000 subscribers. "We have the capacity to install about 40,000
dishes a month, so it is possible we could recoup by year end," he
says.

A CRISIS OF IDENTITY

Cable TV in the Philippines is a growth industry, but regulatory issues
need to be resolved before it can reallydevelop. By Sarah Walker

The Philippines may be home to one of Asia's lesser developed economies
but its cable system is surprisingly well developed and, coupled with
interest from overseas investors, is growing rapidly.

A country with a population of 66 million, there are currently 5.5
million TV households in the Philippines. To date, cable has passed
over 40% of TV homes and there are an estimated 300,000 to 350,000
subscribers. Projections for the year 2000 are over one million.

The Philippines Cable TV Association (PCTA), an efficient industry body
formed in 1987 with six charter members, now numbers 216, although the
number of cable operators that have received cable licences from the
National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) is 320. PCTA estimates put
the total number of systems operating at between 260 and 300.

Sky Cable, the country's largest cable operator, carries 55 channels
and has a subscriber base of 120,000 (see sidebar), however most
operators carry between 10 and 20 channels and serve anything from 300
subscribers upwards.

Although monthly subscription fees, which range from P90 ($3.50) to
P430 - depending on the location of the service - are low, the ability
of most Filipinos to speak English has provided a ready-made market for
western companies.

Most of the major satellite broadcasters are carried on Filipino cable
systems, including ESPN, TNT/Cartoon Network, HBO Asia, The Discovery
Channel and Star TV. Operators receive the services from satellites
such as Palapa B2P, PAS-2 and Apstar 1, and, like Indonesia, the
geography of the Philippines means most of the major VHF and UHF-
delivered broadcasters such as ABS-CBN and GMA 7 are also carried via
satellite and then relayed by cable. In outlying areas where
terrestrial reception is poor this has resulted in a big demand for
cable TV.

However, in the bigger cities, where UHF and VHF signals can easily be
received, the demographic of the average cable viewer tends to be
higher, as in this instance cable is an add-on service, not a
necessity.

In Metro Manila for example, between 60% and 80% of viewers are in the
AB category as opposed to elsewhere, where they only number 30% of
viewers.

In addition to the relaying of foreign channels and national
broadcasters, a few locally-produced and packaged channels are also
carried. Sky Cable has three of its own, while the Hollywood Channel,
which began broadcasting off Palapa B2P in March, is a 16-hours-a-day
nationwide cable network that, according to Liza Legaspi, programme
manager, broadcasts mainly acquired U.S. programming such as Time Trax
and Lois and Clark.

Carried by about 100 cable operators, Hollywood Channel has plans to
start producing original programming soon. Its sister company, Cable
Boss, is a distributor and acts as the middle-man between  programmers
and cable operators, providing monthly figures and collecting revenue -
under-reporting of the subscriber base is still a big problem in the
Philippines.

The other major  distributors are Accion, and Yes Cable. Many of the
U.S. broadcasters use all three, as does Star TV. According to its
general manager, southeast Asia, distribution and marketing, David
Ilagan, the pan-Asian broadcaster will be launching a full Filipino
Channel, once Asiasat 2 launches.

Although the Philippines can lay claim to having built one of, if not
the first, cable system in Asia - constructed in Bagio City in 1969 -
the imposition of marshall law by the Marcos regime in 1972 put a
freeze on the telecoms and broadcasting industry. From that point on,
cable TV's development, like the country in general, stood still.

It wasn't until 1987 when the government of Cory Aquino allowed any
citizen of the Philippines to build a cable system, (as long as they
submitted the applicable technical and financial studies) that cable
began to grow again.

Now that President Fidel Ramos, who has set his sights on turning the
Philippines into a newly industrialised nation by the year 2000, cable
can really begin to develop beyond its formative stages. Or at least
that's the theory. Regulatory wrangles and legal loopholes mean that,
presently, Filipino cable does seem to be undergoing something of an
identity crisis.

Currently cable in the Philippines is classified as broadcast media,
but the NTC is formulating plans for it to be reclassified as telecoms.
Should this take place it would bring about a number of changes, the
most significant being a change in the foreign ownership ceiling from a
present zero to 40%.

Most industry observers think foreign investment is the only way cable
operators will be able to upgrade their infrastructure significantly to
compete with the country's rapidly growing telecoms market. Indeed a
number are already forming alliances with U.S. cable companies in
preparation for an easing of restrictions.

The most high-profile overseas operator is the Falcon Cable/Cavite
Cable Systems joint venture in which the U.S. company helped the cable
operator install a fully fibre-optic system. Fellow U.S. predator UIH
also has an alliance with Sun TV. Other U.S. companies thought to be
looking for strategic alliances include Time Warner and TCI.

"To go from 250,000 [subscribers] to over 2.5 million the cable
industry needs to establish stability, a level of professionalism and
vision," says Clive Flessig, vice president international, Falcon
Cable. "Telecoms will come up with a compelling argument to get into
the business... International investors are in need of a local partner
who is familiar with the environment."

There have already been some informal tie-ups between telcos and cable
companies to provide telephony over cable. To name just one, the
Philippines Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) and Manila's County Cable
Communication's Network have been testing infrastructure pairing
traditional copper wire and co-axial cable for the provision of
telephony, using U.S. company First Pacific Network's (FPN) technology.

The present telecoms bill currently allows telcos to provide cable TV
but not vice versa, therefore it is evident some changes in the law are
necessary to create a level playing field.

The PCTA recognises this but is opposed to the possibility of a
provision for cable being inserted into the Telecoms Act. Instead it is
presently drafting its own cable TV bill to put before Congress which
would classify cable as a separate entity.

While not fully against foreign ownership of cable, the PCTA is anxious
to retain the industry's autonomy and is unlikely to recommend a full
40% ceiling, perhaps opting instead for 30%, with ownership taking the
form of equity participation, but not management control.

Should cable eventually fall under the banner of telecoms, operators
will also have to apply for a Congressional Franchise before
approaching the NTC for a licence. The PCTA vehemently opposes this,
saying the cost involved would prejudice the smaller operator. Others
disagree. "If you look at the 300 or so operators pending licences,
many are mom and pop operations who really don't have enough money to
get in here and offer a reliable service. A congressional franchise
would shake out the small guys from the big guys," says a Manila-based
consultant. A Congressional licence requirement could also help limit
overbuilding, he adds. At the moment there is no limit on the number of
operators allowed per district.

Whatever the outcome of the regulatory changes, in order to develop,
the industry will need some sort of financial boost. The current move
towards consolidation will provide operators with not only more finance
for infrastructure upgrades and original programming production, but
also greater muscle with which to bargain with overseas programmers

Additional money could also come from advertising. At the moment this
too is officially banned although many systems do sell commercial
airtime.

The PCTA is currently pushing for between four and five minutes an hour
compared to the 16 minutes currently allowed on the national stations -
which in turn are opposing the proposal.

Says one cable operator: "National broadcasters view us as a possible
threat to their revenue base, but it is likely that we would be going
after the local market."

LEADER OF THE PACK

Sky Cable - the Philippines' largest operator - reaches 100,000 cable
subscribers, of which 70,000 are located in Metro Manila.

Operating a basic package of 55 channels at a cost of $16 a month, it
is one of the few operators to package and produce its own channels.
Currently numbering three, these are the I Channel, comprised of kids
fare in the daytime and adults at night, Sky Movies and a Filipino
channel that airs movies and locally-produced news and entertainment in
the local Tagalog dialect.

Sky is also the first operator in the Philippines to operate a premium
tier. Launched on July 1 after two weeks of testing as part of the
basic package, the tier is initially offering two Mandarin-language
channels: TVBS, the international arm of Hong Kong terrestrial
broadcaster TVB, at a cost of $4 and news service CTN, at a cost of $2.
There is also a one-off members' fee of $100. By year end the cable
operator hopes to be providing 10 premium channels and is thought to be
in discussions with MTV and Japanese terrestrial NHK.

According to Sky Cable general manager Mel Verlade, the premium tier is
initially aimed at the country's minority, but wealthy Chinese
population.

Sky is using General Instrument's Jerrold equipment for the service.
David Johnson, GI's Asia Pacific support manager, says the deal marks
the first fully interactive, two-way addressable system to have been
sold to the Philippines. Sky has also acquired some impulse PPV boxes
and is currently negotiating with rights-holders. Verlade said VOD is
also a possibility in the future.

Sky owns some eight cable systems nationwide and is looking for further
acquisitions. It is also in the process of laying 100km of fibre-optic
cable in  Metro Manila, with the economically-prosperous town of Cebu
the next possible target for a major infrastructure upgrade.

Owned by the Benpres Group, holding company of the locally powerful
Lopez family - whose subsidiaries include broadcaster ABS-CBN and local
telecoms operator Bayantel, in which Nynex owns a 25% stake - Sky is
not short of cash, or contacts.

ASIAN AESTHETICS

On-air identities and graphics are crucial to the branding of a
channel. Janine Stein looks at how networks are adapting their look to
suit the Far East markets

Staffers at the TNT & Cartoon Network Asia just don't talk about movie
genres anymore. The lavish Thirties swashbuckling drama, Captain Blood,
has become a "magenta." The futuristic 1970s science fiction Logan's
Run, on the other hand, is "definitely a green," according to the new
TNT-speak.

To the crew that is creating an on-air Asian identity for the classic
Hollywood channel, films have become colours and clips set to music to
create a certain mood, to encourage an emotional reaction.

This emotion is TNT's greatest weapon in the American movie channel's
battle for an Asian identity. "No-one has seen the movies and they
don't know our stars in this part of the world," says TNT's director of
programming, Andrea Miller.

But the emotions are universal: love, jealousy, greed. "All these
movies have great emotional content, great moods, great stories,"
Miller says. And TNT has translated them into colour.

While the palette the night-time channel uses reflects Asian cities
after dark, in TNT-speak blue equals light-hearted, comic and musical -
for movies like The Glass Bottomed Boat. Promos for an evening of
traditional family entertainment are gold, while screens filled with
green herald edgy, sci-fi-types like Shaft or Children of the Damned.
When the promos are purple, the movies will be darker, filled with
mystery and suspense. Magenta is reserved for grandeur, for costume
dramas and epics, for films like the Adventures of Don Juan.

If TNT has moved away from its movie icons to achieve an Asian look,
virtually all the channels have shunned traditional Asian icons in
their quest for an Asian identity.

"Anything that you would love to see on a postcard, we try to avoid,"
says David Flack, MTV's director of on-air promotions. "We're looking
for youth culture, the kinds of things that young people are interested
in."

The traditional pool of instantly-recognisable Asian images - dragons,
chop sticks, fans, jade carvings - are "kind of corny," Flack says. TNT
& Cartoon Network's creative director, Ian Diamond, calls these
cultural icons tired and jaded, and steers clear of moviedom's
equivalents - the director's chairs, the strips of film, the
spotlights.

"We wanted to create a look that was contemporary, unique and elegant;
a look that suggested the essence of Hollywood yet avoided Western or
Asian movie cliches," Diamond says.

In contrast to the channel's nostalgic tone in Latin America, TNT
Asia's pitch aims to "appear timeless, not too attached to particular
faces, styles, or periods... we will sell the emotions, energy and
dynamics of Hollywood." It's a concept created in the U.S. For their
new Asian image unveiled earlier this year, TNT went to New York-based
design firm PMCD.

"It was a case of people for the job," Diamond says. But he insists
local artists have as much chance of participating in the network's
ongoing creative process as anyone else. "It's a matter of artistic
talent."

TNT's design elements include fire, water and light, a 3-D feel is
created with movie clips in multiple backgrounds and light play.

Diamond makes heavy use of what he calls "organic" (as opposed to
electronic) elements - 35mm film, original instruments, the real rather
than the virtual - to create TNT's sumptuous night-time feel. Although
he later processes the images on 3-D particle animation using SGI
Wavefront software, he sets great store by their "real foundation."

Just in case the subtle messages are missed, TNT has taken out an on-
screen insurance policy - the word "movie" running in different
languages at the bottom of the screen. "This avoids disruptions to the
basic look and feel but successfully delivers a simple and direct
message to viewers," TNT says.

In a much more powerful programming position, the Discovery Channel is
less esoteric about the on-air image it is forging in Asia. Saffron-
robed monks, the sun rising over a Buddha, traffic in Bangkok,
Sukhothai, plus lots of Asian faces and places are all part of the on-
air promotions and fillers. Each market has its own promos and
interstitials. "We are bringing people their own cities, something to
identify with, pieces of everyday life," says director of on-air
promotions, Susan Seelandt.

The images are set to original music on traditional instruments - a
route also favoured by Asia Business News (ABN). "It's much softer, and
the melodies are Asia-specific," says ABN's deputy managing editor,
Jeremy Pink.

CNBC Asia also aims to echo on-screen pieces of its viewers lives. At
the same time as avoiding the "hard-nosed aggressive approach," the
channel brings images of the way Asia does business to the screen.
Exchanging business cards, greetings, scenes of industry, of stock
exchanges, "things that are typical and obviously Asian, but not
stereotypical," says Robert Wilson, director of network distribution
and marketing.

Creating an identity that works is an imprecise science in such a new
arena. Apart from the obvious don'ts, such as being careful with images
of pigs and pork for Muslim audiences - and that means no Porky Pig on
the Cartoon Network - the creators of on-air promos for Asia are mostly
still easing into the market.

At the Discovery Channel, Asian graphics are currently being phased in
to take the place of graphics from the U.S. "We are in the process of
Asianising the look," Seelandt says.

Next year, when the channel launches its Bahasa and Japanese services,
new graphics with an Asian colour palette using reds and golds will
replace the flourescents and light colours of the U.S.-generated
images. The graphics will be commissioned from Asian artists. "These
are the people who are going to be watching. They know better what will
make people happy," Seelandt says.

While even Asian-based channels such as Asia Business News has not left
colour choices to chance, the global channel least concerned with an
Asian colour palette is MTV.

"We use every colour of the rainbow, sometimes all at once," Flack
says. "The designers are locals, and we're dealing with a young
audience which is less concerned about auspicious colours than older
audiences. We trust them. We have sat down to discuss the wisest kind
of design, but we haven't gone into colour details because that comes
naturally."

Bowing to Asian tastes has been less in the form of content and more in
feel. "We have gone out of our way here to soften the packaging and
promotions," Flack says. "There are fewer cuts than there would be in
the U.S. and Europe, and the whole thing is softer. It's still really
powerful, but the pace is a little easier on the eye."

With a choice of 300 to 400 station IDs, "if someone doesn't like one
of our IDs, a new one will be on in a couple of minutes," Flack says.
Obviously, all efforts are made not to offend anyone. "There was one ID
which has a guy eating a freshly-roasted pig, which we obviously didn't
screen."

Most of MTV's IDs are from the U.S. The Asian operation, launched in
April, has produced three so far, although they have come up with a
swathe of image promos. "We only make IDs when we find very good
subjects," Flack says.

Although he makes heavy use of local talent in producing on-air promos,
one of the problems Flack has "is that people come up with things they
think we want. We have to ask them to think beyond that... If producers
are making something for a Taiwan audience, they have to think about
things from a Taiwan perspective. But it doesn't necessarily have to
feature a Taiwanese thing." Having injected the MTV attitude, "the best
thing for me to do is to take a back seat" and let locals get on with
it, Flack says.

Apart from the language, differentiating MTV Asia from MTV Mandarin is
easy: Although both have the kind of laid-back cool MTV cherishes, MTV
Asia's attitude is less gentle, the humour less black. An MTV Mandarin
image promo will have some dude with wire coat-hangers rigged to his
head as antennas for the MTV signal. On MTV Asia, a skeleton in a
suitcase and a gun show up on an airline's X-ray conveyor belt.

Whatever the routes they've chosen to take in establishing their Asian
credentials, in every case there's a need for international programmers
to meld modern Asian elements - a face, a skyline, a city street - with
internationally established channel brands.

"We are giving a local version of something that people want, in much
the same way as they want other products from abroad," Flack says. "We
make it local, but it still has to be MTV. It still has to be part of
the world network."

ESPN takes that thinking further. ESPN Asia's general manager for
programming and production, John Davies, calls ESPN "a universal brand"
with a distinctive graphic style that runs through all the networks.
"The network ID is just ESPN. The look is recognisable. We're not
putting Mickey Mouse ears on anything."

It's the same line Turner is taking with Cartoon Network, which is sold
in Asia with TNT. "Donald Duck is universal," they say.

Like the Discovery Channel and others who are customising with
subtitling and voice dubbing, ESPN's programming, language, and
promotions will be tailored for different markets. However, Davies
insists, "we are not branding the channel Asian. We are not trying to
identify ourselves as anything - just ESPN... Colour is not something
we concern ourselves with."

With its universally popular sports content and its proven record even
in Asia's most difficult markets, ESPN's identity requires a lot less
physical effort than TNT's at this stage. As the movie channel found in
Malaysia, sometimes, no amount of colour, mood or manipulation will
work. New MMDS service, Mega TV, which launches later this year, gave
the nod to the Cartoon Network and the flick to the classic movies.
Mega TV's reason? They just aren't appropriate for a Malaysian
audience.

FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE

Casbaa is linking with Reed to bring this year's Cable & Satellite
Convention in Hong Kong (December 6-8) back to basics

A cliche it may be, but few can deny that Asia's satellite and cable
industry is growing at a rate of knots. Region-wide, almost without
exception, cable and or DTH infrastructures are rapidly being
developed. New satellite launches providing digital capabilities will
further proliferate the number of channels available. Advances in
technology means Asian countries should be in the position to leapfrog
levels of development that have characterised the growth of multi-
channel environments in the U.S. and Europe.

However there is a downside to Asia's rapid development. An overall
lack of knowledge and expertise, an absence of uniform technical and
operational standards, and, in many cases a total lack of effective,
regulatory legislation has lead to incoherent and disparate growth
throughout the region.

The Cable & Satellite Asia '95 show which is to be held at the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, will attempt to address some of
these issues through its convention, while allowing companies a chance
to showcase some of their products.

The show is being organised by the Cable & Satellite Broadcasting
Association of Asia (Casbaa) in conjunction with Reed Exhibition
Companies. A non-profit association set up in 1993, the aim of Casbaa
is to bring together the various parts of the industry, including
international and national programmers, hardware suppliers and cable
and DTH operators to achieve some stability and work towards achieving
common goals.

"We are a young organisation," says Bill Hooks, immediate past
president of Casbaa and HBO Asia managing director (he has been
replaced as president by Turner International's Ted McFarland). "Early
on we were looking for a reason to exist, it was necessary to define
our mission and reach a point where we could convince our members that
Casbaa could make contributions by furthering the cable and satellite
business."

The three-day convention will be the first in a series of industry
events organised by Casbaa. Hooks says the aim is for the show to
become an annual date in the diary for delegates and exhibitors not
only from the Asia-Pacific region but also the U.S. and Europe, and the
premier event for those baffled by the ever-increasing and ever-costly
number of conferences and exhibitions currently being staged in all
corners of Asia.

"There are too many conferences that look like each other and deliver
the same papers, run by for-profit companies who in our view don't
spend enough time worrying about what might be in the best interests of
attendees in terms of content and execution," says Hooks. "They are
very expensive and targeted at senior executives as opposed to what is
emerging as an industry with many different levels... to the typical
Taiwanese or Philippine cable operator the relevancy of, say, a
discussion on telephony today, given where they are in terms of cable
development, is so far removed from what they need to do as to be
irrelevant."

As such, the Casbaa conference plans to go back to basics, moving aware
from "paper-delivering panels" and more towards general sessions and
workshops on issues that are meaningful to companies attempting to
build basic cable infrastructures, such as the use of fibre in building
cable systems, or an explanation of the technical specifications needed
for the building of a modern, not overtly expensive, cable network.
Other subjects the committees have identified as possible workshop
topics include programming, marketing, on-air promotion and customer
service. General sessions will address broader issues such as market
access and copyright.

The conference will also comprise a keynote address from a well-known
industry leader.

As for the exhibition itself, which will be located on Level 7 of the
Hong Kong Conference and Exhibition centre, almost 70% of the 2,500
square metres of floor space has been booked.

MONEY BY NUMBERS

Both China and India will continue to represent major growth areas in
the Asian cable and satellite market, says telecoms consultancy MTA-
EMCI's Sam H. Book

The situation today

China has nearly 40 million cable homes representing about 13%
penetration of total households. Over 12,000, mainly low-capacity catv
systems carry between eight to 20 channels including terrestrial
broadcast stations, government channels and up to four Star TV
channels. Cable rates are about $1 per month and installation charges
come in at between $25 and $35. Reception is the primary motivation for
subscribing to cable television in China, a situation similar to
America in the 1950s and '60s when most American cable subscribers
lived in rural areas and small towns with poor off-air reception.

India, by comparison, has over 12 million cable homes which represents
approximately 7% of total Indian households and over 20% of urban
Indian households. Over 35,000 local cable systems provide
retransmission of terrestrial broadcast stations and a growing array of
satellite programming. Most Indian cable subscribers can now receive
CNNI, BBC World, Zee TV, and several Star TV services, in addition to
regional TV stations and the national state-owned broadcaster,
Doordarshan. Monthly cable subscription rates are between $3 to $5 with
installation costs about $15.

As regards the growth of satellite dishes for DTH delivery, the
statistics for China are particularly impressive. Despite an official
government ban, there are currently over one million satellite dishes
installed and additional dish sales are topping 5,000 a month.

Likewise, India also has over one million installed dishes, but the
proliferation of cable systems, each carrying most of the available
satellite programming, is inhibiting the growth of dish sales to the
home.

Projections For Tomorrow

The economics of cable television require density of homes and
households with disposable income. Hong Kong, Singapore and cities in
Japan, Taiwan, Korea and several other Asian countries are economically
viable cable markets, while areas with low population densities and low
incomes are not viable for modern, broadband systems. China's major
urban markets, especially Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and a
few other cities in Guangdong province contain most of China's newly-
emerging middle class population, providing sufficient concentrations
of affluent households. Urban India, comprising 30% of the total
population, includes four major metropolitan centres, each with between
five to over 10 million people and about 30 cities housing between one
to five million people. MTA-EMCI estimates that between 10% to 15% of
all urban Indian households have sufficient disposable income to be
able to afford cable and satellite television.

The market for satellite television equipment and programming
incorporates both cable operators and direct-to-home (DTH) services.
Consumer demand for DTH depends again upon disposable income levels and
also the competition provided by cable services. Cable has first-mover
advantages over DTH in both China and India, especially in the upscale
urban markets. For example, recent MTA-EMCI focus studies in New Delhi
and Bombay revealed that nearly 80% of a sampling of high net worth
households subscribed to cable.

However, despite pervasive poverty, rural areas in China and India are
also promising DTH markets. If only 2% of non-urban Chinese and Indian
homes had sufficient wealth to buy satellite equipment and programming,
the non-urban potential market for DTH would be approaching three
million homes in India and five million in China.

Broadband, hybrid fibre/co-axial (HFC) cable systems are in development
in Beijing, Shanghai and in each provincial capital, but most of these
systems are still in the planning stage, and their economic viability
is uncertain. In India, agglomeration of small cable systems is
underway in New Delhi, Bombay and a few other cities. The Indian cable
industry may evolve towards the U.S. model of multiple system operators
(MSOs), or cable may remain a fragmented, locally-owned and operated
business. Much of cable's future depends on government policy and
regulation.

Based on a combination of on-site data collection, analysis of
secondary data and demographics and consumer demand modelling of cable
and satellite television, MTA-EMCI forecasts the rapid growth of cable
and satellite in both China and India.

In China, cable and satellite homes are projected to grow from about 40
million today to over 130 million in 2005. In India, cable and
satellite homes are projected to grow from 14 million today to 53
million in 2005. Cable and satellite penetration of total households is
projected to increase from 12% to 34% in China and from 8% to 25% in
India between 1995 and 2005.

MTA-EMCI, resulting from a merger of Malarkey-Taylor Associates and
EMCI, is a leading global telecommunications consultancy, with offices
in Washington DC, London and Singapore

ASIA SATELLITES TRANSPONDER WATCH

168oE: PAS-2

CNBC Asia has now replaced ANBC on 411MHz. A transponder has been hired
by TVBI to beam programmes into northeastern Asia and Taiwan.

138oE: Apstar 1

The official inquiry on the fatal crash of a Chinese Long March 2E
rocket has now been reported. Apstar 2, the sister satellite to this
one, was due to locate at or around 77 degrees East last January, but
was apparently lost when severe cross-winds above the site damaged the
fairing - the fibre-glass cover on the nose cone which encloses the
satellite. International Telecom Japan recently started a feed of
Reuters VideoNews via this satellite as the second hop from Intelsat
704, with some additional regionally-specific feeds.

113oE Palapa B2P

Australian Television, the ABC external TV service, is in serious
difficulty. Although the signals on this satellite continue, a review
of Australian global broadcasting is imminent. CNBC is in-the-clear
until October and will use Asiasat 2 next year. MTV Asia has moved into
B-Mac encryption.

116oE: Koreasat 1

Koreasat 1, a Lockheed Martin Astro Space Series 3000 satellite, is
South Korea's first domestic satellite. Launch was delayed by Hurricane
Erin and may have not achieved the correct orbit without considerable
use of the fuel reserves. The failure of a booster rocket to separate
from the Delta rocket carrying the satellite into orbit will mean a
reduced life. The additional drag created by the booster meant that the
satellite could not be delivered into its intended orbit. The launch
was at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and the launch vehicle was a
Macdonald-Douglas Delta 2 rocket. Delta 228 was the first major partial
failure of such a vehicle. The Hercules GEM solid booster, by failing
to separate, caused the first stage to deliver less velocity. The
second stage compensated by burning for 35 seconds longer than planned
on its first burn, which placed the rocket in parking orbit. The second
stage shut down early when fuel ran out. The third stage placed the
satellite in an orbit with an apogee of just 30,000km, which is below
the required 35,700km. A second satellite could provide back-up, it was
to have been put in a storage orbit until the capacity was required.

93.5oE: Insat 2B

After some false starts the DD3 channel has launched, with a schedule
of arts and current affairs programming. Insat 2C's launch will add
much-needed transponder capacity over Asia. If granted capacity, as
they hope, a growing number of international TV channels could beam via
Insat into the regional DTH and cable audience. The evidence of the
controversial deal between Doordarshan and CNN is being seen on Insat
2B. Doordarshan and CNNI have launched a joint 24-hour on this
satellite at 4160MHz vertical Tp. C12. Pakistan and Bangladseh already
have terrestrial arrangements with the 24-hour news channel.

85oE: Raduga

Business India TV, which has been reported on this satellite, is
gearing up for a move to Ekspress, which may herald another launch as
14 degrees West seems an unlikely location for such a geographically-
targeted channel. On the 3875MHz RHCP channel, BITV has been showing
TVI News - current affairs programmes - and TVI Prime entertainment.

NEWS OF THE WORLD

If the penny hadn't dropped before, December's announcement by Capital
Cities/ABC that it was joining the 24-hour news business in 1997
confirmed that televised news is no longer the preserve of the
traditional networks, and that in order to retain market share better
to be a rolling service than one which relies on that now rather
decrepit notion of expecting viewers to tune-in for their news at set
times during the day.

In staking its claim for a piece of the all-news market, Capital
Cities/ABC joins rival American network NBC and Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp, all of which have in their sights the superabundance of existing
24-hour news and business news channels now in service worldwide.

So why the sudden rash of interest in 24-hour news? After all,
programmers have long bemoaned that news is too expensive to produce -
especially the thrifty generalist satellite channels. This, however, is
changing. News costs might not still be in the same league as, say, a
half-hour of syndicated infotainment acquired from a US programme
distributor, but technology developments inside and outside the studio,
coupled with the changing commercial view that news can be a profit-
generator not just a cost-centre, are putting it within the reach of
the many rather then the few.

But while the entry barriers come tumbling down, for cable distribution
they still remain high, meaning carriage is more and more dependent on
strategic cable operator-programmer alliances. For example, the Time
Warner/Turner merger, combining, among others, the top two US MSOs (if
Turner shareholder TCI is included) and CNN, is a timely boost for
America's original all-news channel just as the competition is about to
hot-up. Meanwhile, in the US, Europe, Asia Pacific and South America,
Rupert Murdoch seems to be assembling the pieces which when connected
will light up a global news network. And where cable distribution
cannot be guaranteed by News Corp or even its own budding partnership
with TCI, direct-to-home will be an effective alternative source of
supply.

For the rest of the field, however, even those with financial muscle,
distribution will probably have to be sought outside of cable. Hence
the partnership between NBC and Microsoft to launch the US
broadcaster's proposed round-the-clock news service on the Internet.

While audiences for such a channel might not at first be as widespread
as, say, cable or even DTH, new technologies and changing commercial
strategies, which are rewriting the way television news is packaged for
consumption, suggest the interactive medium is a better one for the
distribution of visual news.

Bob Ross, Turner Broadcasting president, international, speaking in
Hong Kong in December, predicted that news channels of the future would
act more like radio stations than traditional TV newscasters. Instead
of airing live bulletins, news channels would simply select from a
'playlist' of recorded, but constantly-updated items, refreshing the
running order throughout the day.

If news is to be presented as such - especially business news, whose
natural audience is in the workplace - is there a better way of
distributing it than via an interactive medium which allows viewers to
double-click on the news that is relevant to their world?

HAVAS FORCES CLT TO QUIT THE DIGITAL CLUB

COMPAGNIE Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT) has reportedly
withdrawn plans to launch Club RTL, its Astra-based French-language
digital direct-to-home bouquet.

In return for dropping plans to launch the package of 15 to 20
channels, which would be in direct competition to Canal Plus, the
Luxembourg-based broadcaster is reputedly set to become a 25 per cent
shareholder in Canalsatellite Numerique and to contribute several
television channels to the Canal Plus DTH bouquet.

The news followed weeks of speculation. Havas, a mutual shareholder in
CLT and pay-TV giant Canal Plus, had from the outset never been
comfortable with the idea of two competing bouquets for France and had
pushed for a union of the two projects. Havas president Pierre Dauzier
said in an interview last month that there could only be one European
bouquet, claiming "no one can beat Canal Plus."

The two companies reached an agreement to share conditional access and
digital IRDs last summer, with CLT joining the SECA alliance led by
Canal Plus and Bertelsmann to develop the Mediaguard system.

CLT had seven transponders reserved on the Astra satellites 1E, 1F and
1G. With this capacity probably about to become vacant, Europe's pay-TV
groups - most notably Canal Plus - may now be expecting an unexpected
increase to their digital Astra allocations.

KIRCH JOINS MMBG ON THE REBOUND

THE digital decoder battle in Germany between the Multimedia-
Betriebsgesellschaft (MMBG) consortium and the Kirch group took a
dramatic turn on December 1 when Deutsche Telekom confirmed it would
not be aligning itself to Kirch's digital decoder technology,
effectively forcing Kirch to join the MMBG.

While MMBG defied the sceptics by displaying its Mediabox decoder in
Cologne in November, the entire MMBG constellation was threatened by
Deutsche Telekom's hesitation on whether to break away from MMBG and
team-up with Kirch and Vebacom, Germany's second largest cable
operator.

Deutsche Telekom announced, however, that it was the MMBG's Mediabox
which offered "a very good platform for the establishment of an open
and non-discriminatory system in Germany." The PTT cable operator
criticised Kirch's failure to comply with its protocol and to provide
the necessary technical specifications - Kirch, it seems, had been
bluffing about the superiority of its d-box technology.

Now Kirch is to take an eight per cent stake in the MMBG and work on a
unified decoder system for the German market - a solution which will
allay fears of two competing decoder systems splitting the German
digital TV market and confusing the consumer.

Germany's Chancellor Kohl, a close political ally of Leo Kirch, stepped
into the digital decoder fray to ask why a French-developed decoder
system (MMBG's SECA-developed Mediabox) was to be chosen by the MMBG in
favour of a German one (Kirch's d-Box). Prompted by Kohl, Deutsche
Telekom, in its public service role, was forced to re-examine the
qualities of MMBG's Mediabox against the Kirch/Nokia-manufactured d-
box. MMBG had given Telekom until mid-December to decide on its role,
leaving the digital decoder consortium in a very precarious position.

As for Kirch, the Munich-based television company never enthused over
the idea of joining the MMBG and partaking in its "open and non-
discriminauory system," despite an offer of a 15 per cent shareholding.
Kirch preferred to fight for its position as the digital gatekeeper in
Germany with its own decoder and Irdeto conditional access system. Now
poised to join MMBG, it seems that Kirch has lost the decoder battle.

Without Telekom, the MMBG would have been in trouble - Deutsche Telekom
currently holds a 35 per cent share in the consortium and its 15
million cable connections were vital for the MMBG to succeed. Vebacom
has a further 1.1 million connections.

MMBG's recent display of its Mediabox decoder countered claims from the
Kirch camp that the consortium did not have a fully-functioning
decoder. The Franco-German consortium said it plans to start operations
in April with further members of the consortium to include oRF, SRG,
Bauer Verlag, RTL-2 and Tele Munchen. Philips is to start mass
production of the decoder this month with key components coming from
its factories in Krefeld and Hamburg. By the start of 1996, the decoder
will be available to French retailers and in Germany by April, with an
estimated qrice-tag of DM1,000-1,510 (#455!to #682).

BELGIUM'S CABLERS THREATEN BLACK-OUT

THE re-negotiation of a global agreement between Belgium's cable
operators and rights-holders on the payment of authors rights reached a
stalemate in December, with cablers threatening to cease carriage of
half of the channels currently distributed if no progress is made
before January 1.

The dispute flared-up back in September when authors' association Sabam
announced that it did not want to renew the global contract on cable
rights, concluded in 1993 between Belgian cable association RTD,
broadcasters and copyright holders (Sabam, Agicoa, Belfitel). Under the
agreement cable companies are allowed to distribute 16 channels from of
a list of 21 able to be received in Belgium via terrestrial
transmitters. Cable operators, meanwhile, pay an amount equivalent to
15 per cent of the average subscription fee (BFr539 (#12)), which is
added to subscribers' bills. Other channels wishing to be carried on
cable, such as pay-TV and satellite channels, have to pay for cable
retransmission rights themselves.

According to Sabam, any new agreement should take into account the
multiplication of channels with the advent of the digital era and
should include a clause regarding neighbouring rights (performers,'
producers' and broadcasters' rights) as provided by Belgian law from
last year. The amount paid to rights-holders should therefore be
increased, the organisation said.

Cable operators argued that, in the last 10 years, the amount paid to
rights-holders has increased by 79 per cent in-line with the increase
in the number of subscribers and of the cable subscription fee. An
increase in authors' royalties would jeopardise their profitability,
they claim, as the Wallonian government forces them to pay a special
tax of BFr150 per subscriber to support local TV stations. They also
consider this a disadvantage in comparison with the DTH industry, as
satellite equipment owners are not subject to the payment of authors'
rights.

According to RTD, the ideal solution would be for broadcasters to pay
for authors' rights themselves. If the current system is maintained,
they would like to see three new channels, M6, Sat 1 and La Cinquiame,
included in the global agreement. And if neighbouring rights have to be
taken into account, RTD claims it could only be practicable if the
amount paid to authors is reduced by an equal amount.

DEUTSCHE WELLE TO LEAD ASIA BOUQUET

A DIGITAL bouquet of between four and five European TV channels, 12
European radio stations and a data channel is to be created for the
Asia-Pacific region via the recently-launched Asiasat 2 satellite. The
package is being spearheaded by German overseas broadcaster Deutsche
Welle, whose 36MHz C-Band Asiasat 2 transponder will be home to the new
multiplex.

The transponder will be compressed using NTL's MPEG-2, DVB-compliant
digital compression system. Deutsche Welle will be using an 8MHz
digital stream and the other television channels between 6MHz and 8MHz.
However, as the new craft will not be ready for digital broadcasters
until April, the package will initially test-transmit in analogue.

Contracts have yet to be finalised and the remaining channels in the
package still to be announced, though it is expected that there will be
representation from other European countries, including Italy's Rai,
TVE of Spain and, if agreement can be reached with Star TV, MCM, the
francophone music channel.

Although some Deutsche Welle programming is already broadcast in the
Asia region via tape-delivered distribution deals with terrestrial
broadcasters such as SBS in Australia, Mongolia Television and a number
of Chinese stations, which then dub programming into their local
languages, the Asiasat service will mark the German pubcaster's first
full channel service in Asia.

Initial distribution will be to cable headends and hotels. Channel
distribution will be handled by Transtel, the distribution arm of
German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF. They in turn have agent
representation throughout the Asia region.

SNG 'RETIREMENT' PLAN FOR ASTRA 1A

SOCIETE Europeenne des Satellites (SES) is planning to use its Astra 1A
craft for satellite newsgathering (SNG) and other related services when
the satellite nears the end of its natural life. The first Astra
satellite, launched in December 1988, would be placed into inclined
orbit and moved to a second orbital slot, probably one of those applied
for by Luxembourg's government on SES's behalf.

Once in position, Astra 1A could be used for both news and sports feeds
and, said the company, backhauls of programming services to the Astra
platform at 19.2 degrees East.

According to SES, if Astra 1A has insufficient reserves of fuel it
could be placed into inclined orbit where, initially at least, it could
provide service for 23 hours-a-day.

Astra 1A has a design life of 12-and-a-half years. Although two
transponders have been shut down to prevent overheating, the remaining
14 remain in sound working order. While establishing a digital platform
at 19 degrees East, SES remains committed to providing a continuous
analogue service for existing customers and viewers.

A move for Astra 1A would be most likely post-1998, when Astra 1H will
assure back-up for the entire Astra fleet.

HBO TO DECIDE ON CINEMAX VIA APSTAR

ASIA looks set to receive its second Hollywood satellite movie channel
as HBO Asia reaches the final stages of its discussions on the
viability of a Cinemax channel launch in the region. A decision is
expected early in 1996.

HBO Asia's outgoing president Bill Hooks said there was room in the
region for a competitively-priced library-based movie channel to
compliment HBO.

The Cinemax channel would be carried as one of the five or six
compressed channels HBO Asia is planning next year for its Apstar-1
satellite transponder. At the moment, the transponder is used to
transmit a separate censor-sensitive version of the HBO movie channel
to Malaysia's Mega-TV.

HBO Asia also revealed that US equipment supplier General Instrument
was the most likely vendor of HBO's digital compression technology.
Other likely channels for the increased capacity are a channel for
India and an uncensored feed for markets which want their HBO in its
original form.

Despite being forced by the lack of infrastructure into basic channel
delivery and in spite of its above-average charges, the pan-Asian
English-language Hollywood blockbuster channel has chalked up
impressive gains in the region. Hopes were that the channel would reach
more than one million cable subscribers by the end of 1995.

At the end of 1994, HBO Asia had 600,000 subscribers. This was done at
the same time as the industry sounded the death knell for pan-Asian
programming. Although HBO has ruled out local movies on HBO Asia, the
programmer has not dismissed the possibility of local films on a second
movie channel.

NETHOLD NORDIC SETS MODEST DIGITAL AIMS

DIGITAL satellite services from Nethold and its subsidiaries FilmNet
and MultiChoice are scheduled to commence via Astra 1E in mid-January.
However, distributor MultiChoice is targeting mid-March as the date
when there will be sufficient receiver numbers in the marketplace to
meet anticipated demand.

MultiChoice Sweden is expecting a gradual build-up in supplies from
manufacturers, including Pace, Nokia, Echostar and Philips. From Day
One, few receivers are expected to be in the marketplace, but this is
expected to build within a matter of weeks. The company expects 100,000
units to be sold across Scandinavia within the first 12 months.

Prices will initially range between SKr6,000 and SKr8,000 (#600-800)
according to the model and whether or not a dish, with or without a
universal LNB, has already been installed.

MultiChoice said that the demand for receivers in South Africa, where
MultiChoice recently launched its PAS-4 DSTV package, was the main
reason why March was being sited as the optimum date for delivery of
regular supplies. However, demand in South Africa equates as much to
stock shortages as it does to the public's appetite for digital
satellite television.

Nethold's three Astra 1E transponders 1E will carry shared services
from FilmNet, SuperSport, Hallmark Entertainment Network and
independent channels for subscribers in Scandinavia and the Benelux.
These are expected to include channels distributed by MultiChoice in
the VideoCrypt II package, among them Discovery, TCC and CMT. In
addition, the subscriber management company will also make available 10
near-video-on-demand channels and an audio service expected to be
provided by Digital Music Express. A majority of the services will be
common to all markets and carry local subtitling and soundtracks.

Travel expects to start in-the-clear transmissions by March and BBC
Prime - currently available via FilmNet's Eurocrypt card - and BBC
World are believed to have been lined-up for Astra distribution.

Separate digital uplinks across Scandinavia will deliver the Nethold
services to Intelsat 601 at 27.5 degrees West. These will be received
in Hilversum, added to other services, then reuplinked to the Astra
system.

THOR 2A FILLIP FOR ONE DEGREE WEST

NORWEGIAN telco Telenor has signed a contract with Hughes Space and
Communications International to build a new, 15-transponder satellite
for the one degree West orbital position. Thor IIA, as the satellite is
to be known, is expected to be operational by spring 1997 and will
distribute both analogue and digital channels to cable networks and
private dishes throughout northern Europe and Scandinavia.

Telenor also plans to increase capacity with a further four to six
transponders in 1996 and is claiming that one degree West will become
the third largest digital satellite platform in Europe after Astra and
Eutelsat.

Telenor launched a package of open digital satellite-distributed TV
channels in Oslo in late November. The digital Nordic bouquet contains
two Danish channels - Danmark's Radio TV1 and TV2 - Norwegian state
broadcaster NRK and Swedish channels TV1 and TV2, which will eventually
be available on cable networks throughout Scandinavia.

Telenor said it hopes to be able to offer the digital channels free
within the next two years, so private households can access the digital
channels without a smart card.

It is the first time that the Danish state channels have been available
on Norwegian television - the Swedish channels have been on Norwegian
cable for some time. Besides the Nordic digital channels, Telenor
distributes 17 analogue channels to cable and DTH via Thor, Intelsat
702 and TV Sat  at one degree West.

Telenor CTV said the aim is to establish an open platform, as there is
great consensus for open conditional access in the Nordic territories.
An open standard, it said, will both maximise digital penetration and
promote the efforts of hardware manufacturers.

SKY VENTURE TO AIR GRANADA ARCHIVES

UK BROADCASTER Granada and British Sky Broadcasting have joined forces
to create a new company, Granada Sky Broadcasting, which plans to
launch eight new satellite channels late this year. The new channels
will be led by Granada Gold Plus, which will offer programming from the
extensive libraries of both Granada and LWT, including episodes of the
long-running soap Coronation Street.

The other seven channels will cover a range of lifestyle topics: health
and beauty, home and garden, food and wine, Granada Good Life, Granada
Men and Motoring, Granada Talk TV and Granada TV Shopping Guide.

The GSkyB package will be available as part of the Sky Multi-Channels
package, which currently offers 28 channels and programme streams at a
cost of #10.99 per month.

David Chance, deputy managing director of BSkyB, was unable to say
whether this would increase as a result of Granada's channels: "Its way
too premature to say whether we will change our retail pricing
structure at all."

The GSkyB package will probably be spread across three transponders,
possibly on Astra 1D, on which BSkyB still has spare capacity. Granada
Gold Plus will broadcast for 18-hours-a-day, while the lifestyle
channels will take the form of programme packages. Men and Motoring,
for example, will have a late evening slot following on from Granada
Gold Plus.

All seven lifestyle channels will feature predominantly new programming
produced by Granada and LWT. "This venture will open-up a whole new
avenue of custom-programme making," said Charles Allen, chief executive
of Granada Television, "enabling us to significantly expand our
programme production facilities in both London and the North West."

Granada's economic interest in the channel is 60 per cent, although its
ownership is limited to 20 per cent under current regulations. However,
Granada is hoping the government will remove the ownership restrictions
on broadcasters becoming involved in satellite channels, and thus allow
it to increase its stake in the new venture.

TCI AND CANAL PLUS IN THEMATIC UNION

TELE-COMMUNICATIONS International, Canal Plus and Generale D'Images,
the media arm of Generale des Eaux, have joined forces to form a new
cable and satellite programming company based in Paris. Each of the
three parties will hold an equal interest in the venture,
Multithematiques.

Canal Plus and Generale D'Images are contributing their combined
interests in four French thematic channels to Multithematiques -
documentary channel Planate (70 per cent), cult programming service
Canal Jimmy (85 per cent), and mini-pay movie channels Cine Cinemas and
Cine Cinefil (60 per cent each). Canal Plus has also contributed a 50
per cent share in the Spanish classic movie channel Cine Classics.

TCI, meanwhile, has agreed to contribute Fr492 million (#66 million) to
Multithematiques over the next two years to develop the thematic
channels worldwide.

Multithematiques will act as a launch pad from which to expand across
Europe, provide new services for TCI's Latin American cable and DTH
ventures and bring thematic channel concepts to TCI's Japanese cable
subscribers. TCI also anticipates co-operation between Multithematiques
and its UK division Flextech in production and channel development.

TCI president, international, Adam Singer, will serve as the first
chairman of Multithematiques, while Canal Plus executive vice-president
international Michel Thoulouze will be the company's CEO.

EUROSPORT DEFEATED IN DUTCH TEST-CASE

EUROSPORT has lost its case against KTA before the Amsterdam court and
will be dropped from the cable operator's system in the Dutch capital
from January 1. The pan-European sports programmer refused to pay the
carriage fee sought by KTA, countering that it should be the recipient
of a Gld0.20 payment. However, the court ruled that the cable operator
is entitled to seek payment from commercial channels.

An offer from KTA to include the channel in its D2 Mac/Eurocrypt
extended basic tier was rejected by Eurosport. Other channels expected
to suffer the same fate include NBC Super Channel and TNT & Cartoon
Network.

With the franco-American owned Eurosport standing to lose a large
percentage of its distribution in the Netherlands, the channel is
expected to appeal against the decision and is also lodging a complaint
of 'misuse of monopoly' with the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Meanwhile, MTV regained distribution in The Hague after a court ruled
that the local operator, Casema, had broken its agreement with the
Viacom channel when it replaced MTV with local programmer The Music
Factory. However, the judge also ruled that the city of The Hague had
to keep its promise to Music Factory and so now both music channels
will be carried.

It is likely that Music Factory's owner Arcade will now also take KTA
to the courts in order to gain access to the Amsterdam cable system.
During access negotiations, KTA demanded a fee of Gld750 for the
channel, as well as the right to insert local advertising breaks -
conditions which were rejected by Music Factory.

Relations between KTA and MultiChoice have also been showing signs of
strain of late. The Dutch Commissariaat voor de Media upheld
MultiChoice's claim to be able to use its own decoders and subscriber
management system rather than KTA's D2 Mac/Eurocrypt set-top box.

KTA's ailing pay-per-view service Teleselect is available via the same
D2 Mac decoders, and MultiChoice claimed KTA wanted to use its extended
basic services to boost penetration of Teleselect.

MSO TO BUILD NEW STOCKHOLM SYSTEM

KABELVISION, a major owner of Swedish cable systems, said it plans to
invest SKr100 million (#10 million) in a new cable network for the
centre of Stockholm. The new system will be designed to carry not only
pay-TV services and telephony, but also games, home-shopping and
Internet connections.

Kabelvision is initially planning to offer the new services to
inhabitants of!some 1,000 apartmenu dwelliogs where individual dishes
have, until now, been used to serve tenants.

Kabelvision's plans are the result of a recent decision by Stockholm's
authorities to build a high-capacity fibre-optic network for each
apartment block in the Swedish capital. Kabelvision will then connect
and develop its own services.

Construction work on the new network is due to begin this January and
Kabelvision plans to launch its services in either March or April.

Some of Kabelvision's competitors are taking a more cautious stance on
upgrading their systems, however. Singapore Telecom, the new owner of
Stockholm operator Stjarn-TV, which already has one of the country's
most advanced cable systems, recently said that  Sweden is not yet
ready for advanced wired services. According to Stjarn-TV, subscribers
in Sweden will not be willing to pay for the multimedia services that
modern cable technology can offer until the end of the century.

Kabelvision, 37 per cent owned by the Kinnevik division Netcom Systems,
United Communications Inc and Time Warner (both 20 per cent) and
Bonnier (13.5 per cent), has around 500,000 households connected, or 20
per cent of the Swedish market.

OFT BEGINS BSKYB PROBE

The Office of Fair Trading has launched a six-month review of British
Sky Broadcasting's position in the UK's pay-television market. The
review follows months of complaints by cable operators, including
CableTel, Videotron and General Cable, which last year asked Trade and
Industry secretary Ian Lang to refer BSkyB to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. The cable operators' chief concern is BSkyB's
practice of bundling channels, claiming that the satellite broadcaster
overcharges them to keep cable rates high and boost Sky's direct-to-
home service.

The OFT's review will be confined to issues relating to the supply in
the UK of programme channels to cable operators. It will also include
the informal undertakings given by BSkyB in March last year.

Once the six-month review is completed, the OFT will decide whether
further action under the competition legislation is appropriate.

In a statement issued in December, BSkyB accused some cable operators
of "using the regulatory process to further their businesses rather
than on building their networks and serving their customers."

SKY NETS MORE SOCCER

In a #125 million deal which left its terrestrial competitors standing,
BSkyB scooped the rights to England's Endsleigh Football League
championship and Football League (Coca Cola) Cup for five years from
the start of the 1996/97 season.

Under the agreement, Sky has exclusive rights to show up to 60 live
matches per season featuring clubs from all three divisions of the
Endsleigh League. Sky will also provide the first ever coverage of all
three end-of-season promotion play-offs from Wembley, and will show at
least one live tie from each round of the League Cup, plus the final.

Most of the live matches will be screened by the satellite pay-TV
broadcaster on Fridays and Sundays. Sky Sports indicated it was still
too soon to say how the coverage would fit into the existing schedule.

Sky already holds exclusive rights to FA Premiership football (60
matches per season) under its #300 million, five-year deal which
expires at the end of the 1996/7 season. It also has long-term
commitments to broadcast live FA Cup ties and replays, and every
England international from Wembley, plus live rights to Scotland's
three premier tournaments.

Sky broadcast 143 live matches in the 1994/5 season.

SUPERSPORT LAUNCHES

SuperSport, Nethold's new sports channel for the Nordic countries,
launched earlier than expected on December 1. Without any show of
publicity, the channel was offered to FilmNet's subscribers as "an
early Christmas present," according to one company representative.

But the new sesvice was not immediately available to all FilmNet
subscribers. December and January are seen by Nethold as an
'introductory period' when the contents of SuperSport will be tried
out.

The channel will also not be immediately available to all Nordic cable
operators. Negotiations with the region's cable companies are not yet
all in place - most cable systems are already crammed and the
introduction of a new channel means that an existing service has to be
dropped, or else moved to a less attractive slot.

FilmNet's DTH subscribers will have to wait until the end of this month
or the beginning of February before the launch of SuperSport proper.

Programme rights already secured for the new service include American
NHL ice hockey, the Italian Football Cup and German Bundesliga soccer.
Among the tennis rights acquired are the Compaq Grand Slam and the
Hopman tournament.

National events of particular interest to Nordic audiences are also
high on the channel's agenda.

US TRIO BACK IBERIA CABLE

Capital Cities/ABC, United International Holdings (UIH), the Latin
American Urbina group and Spanish cable company Multitel have joined
forces to exploit cable television in Spain and Portugal.

The new alliance has acquired the entire shareholdings of Spanish cable
company TPS, set up by the Urbina group, which distributes the Spanish-
language channels Canal Hollywood, Panda Club, Tele 1 and Discovery
Channel to cable operators.

A new company has been set-up by the four partners in the venture, with
Capital Cities/ABC, UIH and Urbina each holding 30 per cent and
Multitel 10 per cent. The group will initially invest Ptas4,000 million
(#21 million) within a period of three years and distribute the package
of four channems for no more than Qtas600.

The offer will initially consist of film channel Canal Hollywood,
children's channel Panda Club (with programming mainly supplied by
DIC), documentary channel Discovery and Spanish/Latin music channel HIT
TV. A fifth channel will be launched in the next five to six months.

The channels will be broadcast  in Spanish and in their original
versions, with subtitles for the Portuguese market.

NEWS RACE HOTS UP

Capital Cities/ABC Inc is to launch its long -planned 24-hour news
network in 1997, according to president Robert Eiger. ABC already
gathers more news than it can use on its ABC network so the costs would
be relatively low and help spread the news division's expenses. ABC's
200 plus affiliated stations are expected to provide more local news
than CNN which has previously had the all-news field largely to itself.

But in addition to the Capital Cities/ABC venture, General Electric-
owned NBC also announced plans for a 24-hour all-news network for early
1996, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is also planning to start an all-
news channel.

A problem for the new channels is expected to be gaining distribution,
with several new channels battling for space in the crowded US cable
market. When the cable companies go fully digital, this problem will be
alleviated, but in the interim, ABC is also looking at other
distribution methods, such as using telco distribution now being
created in the US, and direct broadcast satellites.

EC IN QUOTA COMPROMISE

The battle against  European programme quotas looks set to continue as
a meeting late in November by EU culture ministers to revise the
Television Without Frontiers directive ended with little change to the
original. The contradictions have been kept in the new 'revised'
proposal, while salt has been rubbed into the quota wound with the news
that the quota system will no longer be phased out after 10 years, but
reviewed after five years.

EU culture ministers reached what they called "a political compromise,"
voting to keep the controversial phrasing of clauses Four and Five of
the original directive to maintain quotas "where practicable and by
appropriate means." The proposed change in the Presidency text to "by
appropriate means" was not taken on. This will allow the UK to maintain
its loose interpretation of the phrasing, but will anger the French,
who had hoped to see a tougher stance on quotas and the "where
practicable" phrase written out.

The new five-year review will please the French, but not member states
such as Germany and the UK, who were hoping to see the quota system
scrapped altogether.

A new article has been added to the directive (article Z), whereby a
committee will be set-up acting alongside the EC to monitor the
implementation of the directive.

THE OTHER RUPERT

In a rare interview, diamonds-to-tobacco tycoon Johann Rupert explains
what lured him into pay-TV, and reveals his hopes and fears for the
digital future. Piero Muscaro and Eleonora Zamparutti ask the questions

Although he made his fortune in tobacco and luxury goods, today the
name of Johann Rupert is synonymous with pay-television. Richemont is
the maker of world-wide brand names like Cartier, Dunhill, Rothmans,
Piaget, Baume & Mercier, Montblanc, Karl Lagerfeld, Chloe and a few
others. With a total turnover of #3.8 billion in 1995 and net profits
of #690 million, Richemont is also one of the largest groups in the
world's pay-television industry through Nethold Corporation, a 50-50
joint venture with the South African public company MIH (MultiChoice
Investment Holding).

Nethold operates in 13 countries in the European pay-television sector,
where it has a total of 2.5 million subscribers. It is present in
northern and eastern Europe as well as in the Benelux with the
MultiChoice-FilmNet group and in the Middle East and Africa with the
South African pay service M-Net.

In 1995, the company booked 24 transponders on the Astra, Eutelsat and
PanAmSat satellites. It has also recently entered the Italian
television market through the acquisition of 32.5 per cent  of Telepiu,
the country's sole pay-TV operator, and 5.5 per cent of Mediaset, the
media holding of Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group comprised, among
other interests, Canale 5, Italia 1 and Rete 4, 25 per cent of Spain's
Tele Cinco and 24.5 per cent of the sports channel DSF in Germany.

From the calm shores of Lake Zug, a few miles from Zurich, Switzerland,
Rupert, the managing director and owner of the Richemont Group, plots
the map of the world's pay-television industry.

Cable and Satellite Europe: What were the reasons behind your decision
to diversify Richemont from its tobacco and luxury goods activities
into the pay-television sector?

Johann Rupert: Towards the end of the eighties we set in train a
profound restructuring plan of the group. It was clear since the very
beginning that our core activities, the tobacco and the luxury goods
business, had one point in common: a great cashflow. This is the reason
why we started seeking an alternative diversification for our
investments. At that time, our now partners of M-Net, who operated in
South Africa in the pay-TV business, offered us a chance to enter this
business. After a deep analysis we realised a few things: firstly, pay-
television companies are generally cashflow negative at the end of the
first two years of activities; secondly, in order to reach breakeven
point they need at least five or six years, though over this time they
create added value and also an interesting distribution network.

Beyond the necessities of diversification there are evident synergies
to be made between the pay-television business, the luxury goods and
the tobacco industry: in all three cases Richemont operates in the
field of intellectual properties and, in particular, trademarks.

C&SEu: Apart from the obvious economic and financial synergy between
the three main sectors in which you operate, is there any other reason
that pushed you to enter the television business?

JR: In order to make a good business you have to project yourself 20
years ahead of your time, and try to imagine what people will want by
that time. Then you have to try to retrace that path backward. And when
I look at today's consumer trends and the behaviour of the younger
generations, I am convinced that the future will be based on
information and that consumption will be tightly linked to
entertainment in its widest sense. All economic choices, strategies and
analyses are subject to today's ever faster pace of our daily living
and must be constantly revised and adjusted. We cannot afford any
longer to stand still on a leading market position, because today,
everything can change suddenly.

C&SEu: What criteria did you use to invest in the pay-TV business?

JR: It is very important to be the first entrants in a new market,
especially when the sector is economically virgin. In reality, you do
not buy market shares, you buy market opportunities. Geographical
diversification is an objective linked to the single opportunities
generated by the different markets. That is what happened in the
Netherlands when Esselte decided to sell FilmNet. Recently, in Italy,
we bought 5.5 per cent of Mediaset, Berlusconi's commercial television
network, and a 32.5 per cent share of Telepiu. Mediaset has since
reduced its overall debts and it now has a considerable cashflow.
Telepiu represents a starting point for digital television: in Italy
there is no cable television and satellite television is not thoroughly
developed - there's around 500,000 satellite dishes. Nethold, through
its conditional access developed by the subsidiary Irdeto, together
with the Kirch group, has created an open door on this new market.

C&SEu: What is your relationship with Berlusconi? Some say you actually
entered Mediaset to do Berlusconi a favour in exchange for a sort of
'insurance' in order to guarantee a return on your investment in case
things went wrong....

JR: This is pure science-fiction. Nobody did any favour to Berlusconi.
In fact, we entered Mediaset once Berlusconi was already into politics.
Besides, I only know Berlusconi as a businessman, since I must have met
him four times altogether. Make it clear: Richemont is a public company
that obeys the London Stock Exchange rules and all our activities are
transparent.  According to my opinion, the Number One rule in business
is that any partnership and business decision I take should make the
cover of the world's press.

C&SEu: Nethold operates in many European countries. Do you think that
in the future it will be possible to offer a sole pay-elevision package
common to all the different territories?

JR: I believe we could define Richemont as a multi-domestic company
rather than a multi-national company. You can think globally, though
you have to operate in different countries taking into proper account
the national specifics. In Europe, we need to have companies with good
local market knowledge and also alliances with different countries we
operate in. In the pay-television business, for instance, we can
operate at European level as far as the technologies are concerned, or
in the so called subscriber management system, and in programme
acquisition.

C&SEu: With digital technology in Europe and in the rest of the world,
there has been a proliferation of partnerships between the big
multimedia groups in order to acquire key positions in tomorrow's
television market....

JR: Now that we have developed our technology of conditional access in
digital television, we are finding a great deal of possibilities in
many countries. Different media groups have approached us, thanks to
the decoder, in order to create partnerships aimed at the further
development of the new technologies. Not only in Europe and the Middle
East, but also in Thailand and in Australia, where Murdoch's digital
television project will use our technology.

C&SEu: Talking of the Middle East: what brought you to the partnership
between MultiChoice and ART, the media group owned by Saudi Sheikh
Saleh Kamel, for the distribution of the Arab-language television
package?

JR: In the case of the Middle East it has been a long-term investment
plan. Countries like Egypt, for instance, are key markets. The
partnership between MultiChoice and ART follows the mainstream of the
multi-domestic company we mentioned earlier. Also in this case our
companies brought in their technological know-how and the SMS, while
ART, which has a great experience in broadcasting, will take care of
the programme package. We expect to see the first results in five years
time. For  Nethold it is a matter of being ahead of the competition in
a critical expansion area at relatively low cost, since we can optimise
our economies of scale. After all, as pioneers in this particular
market we will be able to extend our operations in marginal, yet
interesting sectors of the industry, such as education, a key problem
in some remote regions of the Earth.

C&SEu: Digital television - in Europe and in Africa you have been the
first to introduce DSTV (Digital Satellite Television). How will
television users change in their consumption habits?

JR: In the US DirecTv offers to its subscribers 150 digital channels
via satellite. What is interesting to observe is that with such a
variety of choice it is clear that consumers will approach the media
differently. For instance, the navigation system is based on menus
classifying the content in specific categories: cinema, sport, art,
music, and so on. Then, through the use of the remote control one can
select an item, sport for instance, and other sub-menus will appear
allowing more detailed choices, a game of golf or whatever. There would
then be five or more tournaments to choose from.

Such changes in the architecture of choice will make irrelevant what
particular network one is watching. Tomorrow we will not be able to
tell whether we are watching NBC or CBS, or at least this could be one
of the possible outcomes.

C&SEu: A true war on digital television standards is being fought in
Europe and in the rest of the world: on the one hand, Nethold and Kirch
with the Irdeto decoder, and on the other Bertelsmann-Canal Plus-CLT,
and also Murdoch's News Datacom....

JR: One of the few things I am certain of in life is that in economics
as well as in politics or in any other sector, if you want to get
everything, you will end up losing everything. This rule may also be
applied in the digital technology sector. I am certain Nethold will be
able to further develop its present market position in Europe as in the
rest of the world, but it will never be able to be the sole service
provider.

C&SEu: Canal Plus and BSkyB both have strong national identities and
company policies. BSkyB is addressed to the UK where it has 4.2 million
subscribers, whereas Canal Plus has also extended its interests outside
France, though its core activity lies within the French boundaries with
its four million subscribers. Nethold, instead, operates in different
countries none of which represents its main market....

JR: The geographical diversification of our activities can be both a
strength and a weakness. Being focused on one particular local market,
as in the case of Canal Plus and BSkyB, allows you to have an enormous
cashflow. Concentrating all efforts on one market can also mean
employing heavy structures and hence having a less flexible
organisation, which in the medium-term could be a disadvantage for the
company itself. As Nethold we grew in the opposite direction, in the
sense that we had to develop a multi-domestic managerial know-how and
at the same time we had to learn how to deal with different currencies,
in different countries with different programmes in different
languages. We had to create a new distribution network which now finds
its strengths in the conditional access which we first developed in
Europe.

C&SEu: Digital television will bring profound changes, above all from
the industrial-economic viewpoint...

JR: When looking at the present structure of the world industrial
economy, one simple yet efficient consideration comes to my mind: if
you don't eat your breakfast, someone else will eat it. This means that
you must re-engineer your own business before somebody else does it.
And this can only be done through continuous innovation which is
destroying your own business by building a new business.

C&SEu: Which will then be the technological trend in the television
industry?

JR: Here the question is, will present TV operators be able to convert
analogue TV into digital TV without jeopardising their present
subscription status? One of the key elements of the conversion is the
software, which is the television programmes, the movies and all the
products offered to the viewers. Consumers' attitude towards technology
can be more or less active, what is important here is what is offered
with the technology. That is the reason why I am convinced that in
Europe there will be big winners and big losers. All markets will
experience a shake-up of some sort, this includes us as well as Canal
Plus and BSkyB. The real question is whether pay-TV operators will be
able to convert their subscribers from analogue to digital before
someone else does it. I fear that in Great Britain, for instance, there
will be great battles in order to get the Premier League rights. It
would be very strange if big media groups such as Pearson, Carlton TV,
the BBC and British Telecom itself, allowed Murdoch to dominate the
technological revolution for the British market. This would be a choice
of non-innovation. I am not saying that Britain will experience a
technological standards fight, though I reckon there will be common
partnerships, perhaps with Murdoch himself for the joint control of the
digital television industry.

C&SEu: As far as the software is concerned, one of the key questions is
the management of television programme archives....

JR: This is an issue that involves all major public TV operators in
Europe mainly due to their longer histories when compared with  the
commercial operators. For example, does the BBC - which has one of the
most extraordinary television, film and documentary archives in the
world - own the rights for digital television exploitation? I don't
think so, and I think nobody owns them today. 20 years ago, nobody even
dreamt of digital television. Hence all rights were acquired for
terrestrial broadcasting, or even cable or satellite. Certainly not for
digital.

C&SEu: What will then be the role of European public television in the
digital era?

JR: There will be synergies between pay-TV and public broadcasters,
particularly if we manage to clear the TV property rights matter
earlier mentioned. In sport events, for instance, there will most
certainly be co-operation between public broadcasters and pay-
television. In England, it will never be possible to broadcast the
Wimbledon tennis tournament in encrypted form, or just imagine what
could have happened in Italy if we had encrypted with Telepiu the '96
World Cup final, Italy versus Brazil - the government would have
probably been dismissed. Nethold has a very strong traditional
relationship with public broadcasters in Holland, Egypt and Greece.

C&SEu: What will then become the position of the big US operators in
Europe?

JR: I think operators will opt for the development of thematic channels
to be inserted into programme packages offered to viewers, and at the
same time participate with stakes in the SMS. It is necessary to offer
great premium programme packages. Take any Hollywood studio as an
example, none of them is capable of filling five movie channels with
their own productions.

C&SEu: The relationship between pay TV distributors and TV software
producers remains a key issue world-wide. It seems that you are
envisaging a clear separation between SMS and TV channels...

JR: The separation between SMS and television channels is a management
choice which we have already applied to the markets we operate in. Take
M-Net, for instance, which manages the programme offer in South Africa.
When a TV network wants to be distributed in the pan-African satellite
package, it can buy shares of MultiChoice at the same conditions as M-
Net and participate accordingly to the management of the company. In
this way, we can guarantee equal treatment to all shareholders.
Specifically to MultiChoice, it only directly owns four channels out of
the 20 presently distributed.

C&SEu: Could Nethold have a real interest in producing films, as Canal
Plus has with Le Studio Canal Plus?

JR: Software control is certainly one of the key issues in the
transition from analogue to digital. The point is that a single movie
channel airs at least 400 films a year, which means that even if we
bought a

Hollywood major we could cover 10-15 per cent at the maximum of our
product needs and at the same time the same Hollywood major would have
reduced benefits being part of the same company. I am sure that the so
called chain distribution system will collapse in the next 20 years.
Today, a film follows this kind of distribution pattern: first the
theatrical release, then the pay-per-view rights sale, then home video
distribution, pay-television rights, and last, the generic channels.
Now, let's say that in 20 years time in Europe there will be 20 million
households with pay-per-view access. This could guarantee an extremely
important film purchase potential, then perhaps the pay-per-view
providers will produce films for their own distribution networks.

C&SEu: In fact, such integration makes front page news in the US on
almost a daily basis...

JR: Yes, but have you ever heard of any of these multimedia companies
paying cash? I don't think so. It is only a matter of paper exchanges,
just contracts, never real money. Sometimes I doubt that any of these
mergers and acquisitions would have really taken place if real money
was involved. Do you know what $20 billion looks like on a table? Such
financial transactions can only work with share swaps, which is also
the best way to reduce risks.

C&SEu: As in the case of the latest merger between Turner and Time
Warner...

JR: There is always a good reason behind any operation. A very
important and very rich American businessman once told me: 'Johann, how
would you define a successful acquisition? It has to do with a company
easy to buy, hard to sell, and impossible to manage!'

C&SEu: What about Germany which represents the most developed
television market in Europe? Are things going to be even harder?

JR: Germany will perhaps be one of the most important tests of the
conversion path from analogue to digital television as far as Europe is
concerned. In fact, this is the only country where two conditional
access system exist, that is, the d-Box developed by Nethold and Leo
Kirch, and the SECA consortium of Bertelsmann, Canal Plus and CLT.
Today, Germany represents the biggest cable and satellite market in
Europe with over 30 million homes connected, though it is a congested
market. If you wanted to launch a new TV channel in Germany, you
firstly have to buy a transponder on the Astra satellites, which is not
easy since they have all been booked out several years in advance.
Secondly, you will need to sign a distribution agreement with a German
cable operator, an even more complex matter since all cable operators
in Germany have already reached maximum capacity. Now it is obvious
that with the new digital technology, these problems can be solved
since the new system through digital compression will be able to carry
from four to eight channels in digital, per transponder.

As far as we are concerned, Irdeto and Kirch have developed the only
and best set-top box available in the market. We are already producing
it industrially, and will be ready soon - in a matter of days - to
distribute our set-top box to the public. It should be  sufficient to
know that Nethold ordered 1.1 million set-top boxes and Leo Kirch
ordered another million.

C&SEu: Recently in France, TF1 and France Television announced an
agreement for the development of digital television. Several observers
consider the SECA consortium as the key issue for the further
development of digital technology in this country. Do you think the
Bertelsmann-Canal Plus-CLT alliance could come to an end?

JR: Ca depend!  I don't really know, though what I can say is that
there will be new entrants in the market and there will be more
partnerships with new companies. As far as the SECA consortium is
concerned, I don't think CLT, whatever situation they are experiencing,
would break the Bertelsmann-Canal Plus agreement.  These are serious
companies and do normally respect all agreements. We are aware of CLT's
difficult position within the consortium. If Havas will come back on
its decision - a remote possibility - CLT would be an extremely
interesting company but perhaps too big for anybody to take into
consideration, even Murdoch.

C&SEu: What are your relations with Mr Murdoch?

JR: Let's say I have great respect for Mr Murdoch. We have never been
in his way!

C&SEu: In conclusion, how will the digital war end?

JR: Has it ever occurred to you while watching a football match on
television that a friend asked you, who is going to win? I normally
answer: 'Well, that is exactly why we are watching the match!' We
cannot be 100 per cent sure of who is going to win or lose. Even in
digital television, with new standards, new conditional access systems.
I frankly do not know who is going to win, the same way as I am sure
that everybody in the business does not have a clue. Everyone bets on
their own horse. We are certain to own an outsider, the best. Though,
there is always a risk that tomorrow Pierre Lescure, Rupert Murdoch and
I will wake-up and read in the press that a big telecommunications
company has invented a new digital standard, hence upsetting all the
plans of companies like us that today are struggling in this dogfight.

C&SEu: What would you do first thing that morning?

JR: I think I would light-up a good cigarette!

CABLE AND SATELLITE EUROPE via NewsNet
January 1, 1996

IN LIVING COLOUR

Two years on, BETI, the first international outpost of US cable
phenomenon Black Entertainment Television, is ready to fly as a fully-
fledged cable service with an appeal which should be sweet music to UK
MSOs. Bill Hicks reports

Lawrence Nugent, co-founder and managing director, operations for the
UK's first black cable television channel, Black Entertainment
Television International (BETI), pens a neat graphic to demonstrate the
position his channel has reached after two years in the market: it's a
large boulder, which has been pushed nine tenths of the way up the
slope of a very steep mountain. "One more little push, we're there. You
won't be able to stop us."

The 'little push' for the service which began in London two years ago
as Identity Television, but which took the name of its US backer, part-
owner and chief programme supplier BET earlier this year, comes early
in 1996 when the channel boards the Orion 1 satellite, making its
signal available to cable operators across the UK and (in theory) the
rest of Europe as part of Orion's growing bundle of digitally-
compressed cable channels.

The roll-out won't come a moment too soon for would-be viewers outside
London who currently go to the lengths of getting their metropolitan
friends to record the hugely popular shows and mail them the cassettes
- adding new meaning to the phrase 'tape-delivered cable channel.'

Ironically, though - having just taken on the BETI name - the channel
is also about to market itself as 'Television In Colour' with the clear
aim of building on its strong, and always deliberate, crossover appeal
to audiences of all races.

The service now available in 262,000 UK cable homes - all in the London
area - launched in mid-1993 as Identity TV. The channel was created by
three black media professionals, Lawrence Nugent, Petra Bernard (ex-BBC
and Warners, now BETI's managing director, corporate affairs) and
Philip Ismay, all of whom had been thinking along the lines of a TV
channel made by, and for, British Afro-Caribbeans.

"We knew there was a huge gap in the market for black-oriented
programmes," comments Bernard, "and cable appeared to be the ideal
medium for us. It was young, its intentions mirrored our intentions."
Cable in the UK was, and remains, chiefly an urban medium, and most of
the UK's two million-plus Afro-Caribbeans live in the main urban
centres, though from the start the aim was wider.

The idea was to launch a channel which would primarily serve Britain's
black communities, but which would be marketed as an "urban
contemporary" service having strong crossover appeal  beyond the Afro-
Caribbean core audience. In that sense it would not be an 'ethnic'
channel in the way of some of the Asian and other minority-language
services, but a specialist channel: "Yes, we're a niche channel, and
our niche is entertainment," says Bernard.

Identity short-circuited the process of finding backers by going
straight to the original and most successful black channel of all,
Black Entertainment Television of Washington DC. With over 42 million
US subscribers, revenues of $115 million (#76 million), net income of
around $20 million in 1994/5 and a hard-won reputation for excellence
in everything it touches, BET occupies a unique position both in the
cable industry, and as an exemplary African-American business success
story.

"We contacted BET, we got access to the president, Bob Johnson, on
conference lines, and we transacted the whole thing over the
telephone... it was, well you can imagine...," says Bernard.

The chance to participate in a European-based cable channel came at a
good moment for BET, which since its launch in January 1980, had built
up its subscriber base to well over 30 million homes across the US and
(from 1992) Canada. On the way, BET had made history by becoming the
first black-owned company to launch itself on the New York Stock
Exchange (in November 1991); it had become a major, award-winning
programme producer and had already diversified into magazine publishing
(with YSB, Young Sisters and Brothers and Emerge), media sales and
merchandising through BET Direct. It had just picked up a 'Hot Growth'
accolade in Business Week's 100 best Small Corporations awards, and was
more than ripe for international expansion.

With BET behind it, Identity was able to approach the UK cable industry
with renewed confidence. "First we went to the cable operators, and we
were fortunate in that the London Interconnect had just become fully
fledged," Bernard says. "We forged an agreement with the Interconnect
MSOs - though we still needed individual agreements with each operator
- and secured London distribution at a stroke, all except Cable London
and Nynex. We got onto Cable London two months later - and with Nynex,
well we're still in talks."

Identity launched itself in style, rapidly building a loyal following
with a mix of programming from BET, supplemented by series from
Caribbean broadcasters and (increasingly) from its own facilities near
Ladbroke Grove (an area of West London fast becoming an alternative to
Soho's media ghetto) and UK-based independent black producers.

The six-hour schedule - rotated twice to form an 18-hour block from
12.00-06.00 - majored then and now on music, which accounts, according
to Bernard, for 42 per cent of programming: "It won't go any higher
than that," she adds - but nor is likely to get much less, since music
is right at the heart of the BET experience, both in the US and
internationally.

According to BETI affiliate sales and marketing manager Alex Jackman,
the music shows - Video Soul, Rap City, Video Vibrations, Video Mania
(the UK scene, produced in-house), Caribbean Rhythms - are becoming
required viewing for UK aficionados: "Video Soul and Video Vibes in
particular are bang up to date, up to the second on the USA scene, you
won't find anything more current. We're actually breaking black artists
in the UK, introducing names not heard here before," says Jackman.

The other major ingredients of Identity's mix were sports, cultural and
educational programmes, comedy and magazine/discussion shows, all of
which are still represented, though since June 1995, there has, in
Bernard's words, been "a clean sweep of the schedule."

That was the point at which the channel re-launched itself as BETI, and
although there was no change in the US partners' shareholding ("We
remain effectively 50:50 BET and Identity," says Lawrence Nugent),
BET's production styles became the measure for the rest of the output.
"We carried three hours a day from BET from the start, so our viewers
were already familiar with the look," she says. "Our job then was to
make everything else come into sync."

Change always has its price, and BETI has had to placate many loyal
Identity viewers who didn't like the fact that a few of their favourite
series disappeared because they didn't make the quality threshold. This
particularly affected some of the Caribbean-produced shows: "The
quantity was there, but the quality was sometimes tenuous," Bernard
says. "We now insist our suppliers maintain a Beta standard." Several
non-BET series have survived, including the popular, newsy regional
magazine show Caribscope, and the Nigerian soap Checkmate, set in the
Lagos business world.

Unlike its US partner, BETI does not have its own news bulletins,
though it provides regular coverage of "core community events, such as
sports, and the Notting Hill Carnival" in the occasional UK Profile
series.

Since the name change, the religious output has also increased,
reflecting the strong Christian philosophy of the US channel, and its
close links with some of the best known evangelical broadcasters in the
US, including Morris Cerullo. On Sunday mornings, for example, the six
hours of 'downtime' are devoted to the Christian ministries: "This is a
very, very strong element in our service," Bernard says, "and the
audience is very receptive. Someone like Morris Cerullo, one of the
biggest names, his audience is our audience."

On other days this six-hour slot is given over to a "special audio
service" - currently a relay of the London black music station, Choice
FM, though as Nugent remarks, "In the long term we would be looking to
create our own audio service." Ultimately, Nugent  adds,  he intends to
develop multimedia services: "There are ways of going interactive which
do not depend on the cable operators upgrading," he says, "though it
will depend on our having a live studio environment." Expansion of the
BETI production facilities,  probably involving a move from its smart
but limited offices in a converted warehouse, is high on the list of
priorities.

Bernard is also looking forward to adding services: "I'd definitely
like more channels, maybe one with a European slant, and I'd like the
channel to get more heavily involved in its own production," she says.
"We already get more approaches than we can handle in the production
area, people are coming to us with million-dollar ideas."

In Washington, BET is planning to launch its long-awaited BET On Jazz:
The Cable Jazz Channel in America this month, but although the service
will go to Africa (see accompanying story) there are no hard plans as
yet to bring it to the UK. The big priority for the London team is to
build its UK audience, with Bernard admitting that "I had hoped the
national picture would come sooner, but it is happening for us now."

As Nugent points out, however, it has taken the full two years to get
the message across to MSOs: "The biggest problem we had in the old days
was that we were deemed to be black entertainment for black
subscribers, so we had to go through the phase of changing their
perceptions. Of course they wanted a channel for their black customers,
but we weren't too comfortable with the idea that we were just for
them, it could alienate other viewers and subscribers."

"When we were IDTV, many operators were confused about us," confirms
Jackman. "They knew about BET in the US, but were confused about the
level of their involvement. They still liked us - they used to say,
'well we prefer you to the foreign channels'!"

Hence the name-change, hence the need for re-educating the industry and
the public, hence the 'Television In Colour' marketing push that broke
in December with billboard, radio and press advertising highlighting
BETI's strengths in sports, music and religious programming. "In the
US, they've achieved high penetration by being good programme-
providers, and we're hoping to emulate that."

The modest target is to "reach 900,000 homes by the end of 1996, and to
get over the million mark very soon after." The stated aim is to reach
4.5 million UK homes by the end of the decade, but to do so by
remaining cable-exclusive. The decision to take digital capacity on
Orion, Jackman stresses, is not a step on the road to going DTH: "All
along we have had a policy of linking ourselves to the success of
cable, and to growing as cable grows. They need us, they need cable-
exclusive original programming, and that's what we are."

BETI UK's total loyalty to cable is not shared by its US godparent: in
September this year, BET joined DirecTv's 'Total Choice' DBS package,
its first move into direct-to-home distribution. And now it is about to
use digital DTH to take its jazz service to southern Africa.

So had BETI never been tempted by BSkyB's Multi-Channels DTH bandwagon,
which would effectively get it into another three million homes at a
stroke? Obviously the potential had been weighed up, but to date the
advantages of staying cable-exclusive, basic tier had outweighed the
lure of the VideoCrypt club. On the other hand, as Bernard notes, "If
the question ever arises, we'd give it due consideration."

National coverage will also raise BETI's attractiveness to advertisers.
It has already attracted an impressive roster on the basis of its
London distribution, encompassing major brands - BT, Mercury, Levis,
Volkswagen, EMI, Cellnet - as well as a host of advertisers from the
black business sector, ranging from travel services, record labels,
hair and beauty products, food and drink specialist suppliers.
Sponsorship is also becoming a useful add-on revenue source, with Carib
Beer, for example, putting its name to BETI's in-house music show for
clubbers, C-lector; and Jamaican building society, Victoria Mutual
Finance, sponsoring the latest six-parter, Sarge In Charge.

At some point, BETI is expected to embark on its European roll-out,
made possible by the Orion feed. "Yes, Europe's in the master plan,"
Bernard says. "At the recent ECC show, we had lots of enquires from
European operators - interest is very strong, even in eastern Europe."

Capacity on cable systems is an even greater problem in parts of Europe
than in the UK, but it's one which Bernard believes is not insuperable
in either case: "They had no problem in the UK satisfying Disney, so
obviously there are ways around the problem."

BET TAKES JAZZ TO AFRICA

BET's 24-hour jazz channel, BET On Jazz: The Cable Jazz Channel, is to
join MultiChoice's South African DTH package, DSTV, on April 1, just
three months after the channel launches on cable networks in the US.

The service, first mooted in 1993 and understood to be costing $20-30
million (#13-20 million) to launch, will be the world's first channel
dedicated to jazz, will be offered alongside DSTV's existing 18
channels at no extra cost, and will be marketed in South Africa,
Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Mozambique and Botswana. Both
the channel and the MultiChoice deal are breakthroughs for BET, which,
with 43.4 million cable subscribers in North America (at November
1995), and with its domestic business already well diversified into
related media and marketing activities, is now firmly looking to
international markets for expansion. "This is a very big move for us,"
BET International vice president George Amoah comments. "Although we've
been supplying programming to African broadcasters for the last year-
and-a-half on a syndicated basis, this is the first time we've launched
there in such a big way."

BETI supplied Bop-TV with an eight-hour daily block of (chiefly
educational) programming which was distributed across African and the
Middle East from a C-Band Intelsat transponder, and now supplies
similar programming to SABC's NNTV, as well as to affiliates in Kenya
and Nigeria the Caribbean, and even to Poland.

"Our plans call for global expansion," he adds, "and we're going into
it aggressively... our initial focus is Europe and southern Africa."

As in the US, where BET has developed a range of complementary
businesses, BETI intends to develop similar opportunities for programme-
related merchandise in South Africa, by building up relationships with
local business.

While Amoah indicated that BETI was eager to bring the jazz channel to
the UK and the rest of Europe, how it will do so - whether as a
complement to the London-based BETI cable-exclusive service using
additional digital capacity on Orion, or as a member of one or more of
the evolving national digital DTH packages - was not yet decided.

What is clear is that the promised mix of live concerts, classic
performances, jazz movies and documentaries will find big ready-made
audiences across Europe and Scandinavia, whichever option is chosen.

TRANS-SIBERIAN AWAKENING

Eutelsat's energetic courting of the Russians is beginning to pay
dividends, with Hot Bird thawing a long-frozen DTH industry, and plans
for the new SESAT satellites well advanced. Chris Dziadul reports from
Moscow

Eutelsat has played a key role in integrating the Russian Federation
into the global satellite industry, both by granting it full membership
status and greatly improving coverage of the country by its satellites.

The process arguably began in 1990 when the organisation decided to
modify two of its Eutelsat II series satellites in order to extend
their coverage to the Urals and Caucasus. Although one was subsequently
lost following the failure of Ariane V63 in early 1994, coverage had by
that time been extended to mid-Siberia and three former Soviet Central
Asian republics by relocating Eutelsat l F1 to 48 degrees East.
Membership followed later in the year in a process that took only three
months instead of the usual eight, thereby indicating how much value
Eutelsat placed on the Russian Federation's future input into the
organisation.

The results to date have undoubtedly been fruitful for both sides. In
Eutelsat's case, it has been able to draw on the country's vast
experience in the satellite industry to order a whole generation of new
telecommunications satellites, while for the Russian Federation
benefits of contacts with - and finally membership of - Eutelsat have
included use of the Satellite Multiservices System (SMS) for Vsat
networks and - since the middle of 1995 - being linked up to the
organisation's international trunk telephony network via an earth
station in Moscow.

Furthermore, in the field of satellite television broadcasting - which
currently accounts for 75 per cent of Eutelsat's income - the launch of
Hot Bird 1 has made viewing of European channels possible in Moscow
with 90cm dishes (rising to 1.2-metres nearer the Urals). At the same
time, Russian broadcasters have been given the opportunity to transmit
their programming using Eutelsat's network far beyond the country's
borders.

Although this has so far only been taken up by the independent
commercial station NTV (which is almost available nationally in the
Russian Federation and claims a 40 per cent audience share in Moscow),
Philippe Cayla, Eutelsat's head of service, new projects, says the
organisation would also like to see the national public broadcasters
ORT and RTR eventually become its clients.

While the Hot Bird system (which currently comprises Eutelsat ll F1 and
Hot Bird 1) will by 1997 be expanded by three further satellites (Hot
Birds 2, 3 and 4) to give even better coverage of the Russian
Federation, Cayla says the 18-transponder SESAT (Siberia-Europe
SATellite) satellite will be designed specially for the country. Due to
be launched in 1998, it will be built by the company NPO-PM in
Krasnoiarsk, located at the 48 degrees East orbital position and cover
an area from western Europe to central Siberia.

In Cayla's view, the "best option" would be for half of SESAT's
transponders to be taken up by Russian clients and for them to offer
viewers "a bouquet of five to six channels." He also feels the
satellite, which will in addition to its standard coverage have a spot
beam aimed at China and southern Asia, may be followed by a second
(SESAT II) craft targeting the far east of Russia.

Eutelsat's efforts have also made a great impact on Russia's domestic
DTH industry, as Alexander Atrashkevich, commercial director of Teleset
attests. Moscow-based Teleset is one of the oldest privately-owned
cable and DTH equipment companies in the Russian Federation, having
been set-up soon after the former Soviet Union gave the green light to
free enterprise in 1988.

From the outset, its business has been divided into three parts: the
manufacture of satellite antennas, which initially were nearly all
exported to European countries due to poor local demand; the import of
electrical components for cable and satellite systems; and the
installation of complete cable and satellite systems throughout the
Russian Federation.

According to Atrashkevich, the country's DTH market only began to
experience "serious growth" in 1995 when Eutelsat's Hot Bird enabled
viewers in Moscow to receive a wide range of European channels with a
90cm dish. Indeed, whereas only a year earlier they had to pay between
$700 to $800 (#460-530) for a 2.5-metre system to receive Eutelsat ll
F1, signals from the new satellite could now be picked up in the
capital with equipment retailing for around $230 - roughly the cost of
a 14-inch colour TV set.

Signals from the Scandinavian platform at one degree West also only
require small sized dishes, and while legal cards are unavailable in
the country pirated versions can be bought for as little as $50.

Although Atrashkevich says it is impossible to give a figure for the
number of dishes in the Russian Federation, information he receives
"from partners and competitors" leads him to believe the total number
of systems sold each year could be between 50-80,000. What is clear,
however, is that the market is growing to the extent that sales in 1995
represented a three-fold increase on those of the previous year, and
this could to rise to six-fold in 1996 due to such factors as reception
of more satellites being possible with small dishes and the launch of
new Russian-language channels which will be distributed by satellite.

He adds that one of the peculiarities of the Russian market is that
although "99.9 per cent of people in big cities live in [apartment]
blocks," smatv systems are relatively rare. Indeed, such are the
discrepancies in people's incomes, many are prepared - and can indeed
afford to - buy their own systems. This may be especially  true in
Moscow, where it is believed average monthly salaries are between $600
and $700 as opposed to the national figure of around $140.

Teleset was an official distributor for Pace between 1991 and 1993, but
now supplies several brands of DTH equipment. In Atrashkevich's view,
there is no clear leader in a market which - in Moscow's case - is
served by only around a dozen retail outlets and several principal
distributors from which the public often buys directly.

Teleset is also builds small private cable networks for offices and
banks. Geographically, its involvement stretches beyond the Federation
to Belarus and Ukraine, although in the latter's case this is limited
due to the poor economic situation.

Atrashkevich believes that although both cable and DTH markets will
continue to grow in the Russian Federation, competition will intensify
and - in the case of cable - the five-year breakeven point for new
systems may deter some investors.

His views are to some extent shared by Alexander Drozdetski, the
commercial director of St Petersburg-based A & A Ltd - the official
distributor for Pace in the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan and
Uzbekhistan - and the General Satellite Association. While
acknowledging growth in the DTH market, he feels this has been most
noticeable in Moscow and central parts of the Russian Federation where
Hot Bird has had the greatest impact, whereas in St Petersburg
reception of most satellite signals (including Astra, Eutelsat and all
those serving Scandinavia) has always been easier with small dishes:
TV3, for instance, can easily be picked up in the city but is
unobtainable in Moscow.

Moreover, this growth can to some extent be explained by rising
incomes, although "there are wide discrepancies." Indeed, "sometimes
people buy equipment because of prestige, others with middle incomes
because this is an area of their interest." What is clear, however, is
that the market is likely to "explode" once satellite-delivered Russian-
language channels (such as those due to launched by RTR this spring)
become widely available.

Like Teleset, General Satellite is involved in the cable industry and
is currently reconstructing networks in St Petersburg for the city
authorities. It also has a mobile uplink station for Eutelsat and
manufactures dishes; total dish sales average around 2,000 a month and
Hot Bird systems sold by the company usually retail for between $260
and $280.

Drozdetski expects cable and DTH markets in Russia to "go the way of
Poland" and expand significantly over the next few years. However,
while remaining free of "government interference," they are still
likely to be hampered by such factors as viewers' low incomes and there
being "not enough Russian-language programmes for individual systems
and cable networks."

PUBCASTER PLANS 'RUSSIAN SKY'

While Eutelsat is undoubtedly opening up the Russian market, the
national public broadcaster RTR is also well placed to make a major
impact with the launch of the country's first digital satellite-
delivered service from Intelsat 604.

According to Stanislav Bunievich, the station's deputy chairman and
director of engineering, RTR Network is a joint venture with an unnamed
UK partner, though rumoured to be BSkyB, and will launch - at a cost of
between $10 to $15 million (#6.6-#10 million) for equipment alone - two
channels (sport and movies) this spring. Distributed by Intelsat 604,
they will probably be followed by further channels for medical,
business and children's television and be available to an audience of
some 40 million "collective customers" - such as those served by cable
networks - throughout the former Soviet Union.

Bunievich says the idea behind RTR Network is to introduce viewers to
the idea of paying for their programming, which in his view is now "the
main way for the development of television in Russia." It is also an
attempt to make the broadcaster less dependent on the government for
its funding and lessen the burden of having to pay 75 per cent of its
revenue to the ministry of telecommunications for the use of
transmission facilities.

Although RTR is currently negotiating agreements with several foreign
programme-providers, Bunievich reckons a need for Russian material will
have to be met. He also believes there will be exceptionally strong
interest shown in the new service's children's and medical channels and
that within the next two to five years RTR, though remaining state-
owned, will become a holding company for RTR Network and other
commercial ventures.

BEAR ON A WIRE

While Moscow's mayor attempts to bring the city's maze of cable
networks under the control of the municipality, MMDS operator Kosmos is
thriving. Can wired and wireless co-exist? Chris Dziadul reports

Although cable remains a relatively underdeveloped industry in the
Russian Federation, there are numerous networks - including such
professional systems as Nika TV in Petrozavorsk around the country.
Wireless cable is a more recent arrival -  but already there are
several MMDS services operated by the US's ITI. But events now taking
place in Moscow are likely to have a major bearing on the future of
both sectors.

Viewers in the capital can for a monthly fee of around R3,300 (#0.47)
currently receive 11 terrestrial channels, of which only six - ORT,
RTR, NTV, 2x2, TV6 Moscow and TV5 St Petersburg - are distributed by
VHF signals. While this allows them to be carried by the city's 80-plus
cable networks, all of which are designed for VHF and have a limited
capacity, the remaining five UHF services, including CNN on Channel 24
and AMTV on Channel 27, can only be received by viewers able to afford
expensive aerials.

This may change shortly, however, following the issue of a decree by
Juri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, requiring all cable operators in the
city to effectively unite into a single network serving some 3.5
million households. In an attempt to stave-off the high levels of
piracy currently found in the industry, Moscow Municipal Cable
Television (MMCTV), which in theory came into being on November 5, will
see large percentages of its airtime given over to official material
(such as local news) and unified programming, with only a limited
amount being allowed for current cable operators' own output.

The move has in effect seen the city authorities claim ownership of all
the networks' wires buried under Moscow, which had up until now been
assumed to belong to local prefectures. It has also led to the creation
of a municipal channel which will have time slots allocated to several
parties, including Moscow's UHF Channel 15 and the production company
NKT.

The creation of MMCTV will, in addition, present an opportunity to
upgrade the city's existing systems. Mostly serving between 3,000 to
15,000 households, few are able to offer viewers more than seven
channels and nearly all are unprofitable.

While it is still unclear who may undertake this work, one of the most
favoured candidates is likely to be Mosteletechnic Corp, the city of
Moscow government's principal contractor. According to Sergei
Samokhvalov, its owner and general director, the company first
approached the authorities in 1991 with an offer to construct new
networks using western technology which would overcome all the
deficiencies of existing systems. This was accepted and accompanied by
a grant of $700,000 for a pilot project serving some 15,000 households.

Due for completion this January, it is also backed by Business Sviaz,
the General Centre for Radio and Television (GCRT-Ostankino), Mir (a
holding company which transmits digital TV/telephony signals via
Intelsat) and Comstar (a joint venture between the UK telecoms company
GPT and Moscow City Telephone Network (MGTS)) and will have enough
capacity for 60 channels. The 30 initially offered to subscribers -
upon payment of $150 for an addressable converter - will be divided
into three packages: basic - 11 terrestrial channels for $0.70 to $1 a
month; commercial - 16 channels including one operated by the city of
Moscow government for $6 to $8 a month; and two pay-per-view channels
for an unspecified fee. The cost of constructing the whole network,
excluding the headend, has been estimated to be $30 per subscriber and
this is expected to fall to $20 to $22 for any future projects.

Samokhvalov says Mosteletechnic has signed agreements with a number of
programmers, including NBC Super Channel, MTV Europe and Turner
International, and will be able to transmit their channels free of
charge for six months. During this time it will undertake a market
survey to determine which channels are most popular with its
subscribers, who in turn will not have to pay for their converters
until the survey is completed.

He adds that the idea behind the project was to develop one of the
first ever integrated cable networks in the Russian Federation.
Although it has taken four years and the help of General Instrument
(GI) to construct, Mosteletechnic now has a close working relationship
with the US company and recently approached the ministry of
telecommunications with an offer to provide integrated equipment for
the new Moscow-wide cable network MMCTV. In Samokhvalov's view, the
company will both secure the right to do so and also act as a
distributor for GI throughout the whole country.

Furthermore, while its pilot network will initially offer only cable
services, these are likely to be supplemented with digital telephony
and data later this year. The project will, in effect, aim to
"demonstrate the possibilities" for similar schemes being undertaken in
the cities of Minsk, Erevan, Baku, Bishek, Alma Ata, Dushanbe and St
Petersburg. It is looking for investors and has held talks with several
parties, including the EBRD.

Another, potentially competing part of the industry showing strong
signs of growth is the MMDS, or wireless cable sector. MMDS TV services
first appeared on the territory of the former Soviet Union shortly
after the collapse of communism. Backed by the US company International
Telcell Inc (ITI) - itself a consortium of several companies including
Metromedia, McCaw Cellular, Comsat Video Enterprises and Morgan and
Associates - it can now be found in the cities of Riga (Latvia),
Kishinov (Moldavia) and Tashkent (Uzbekistan), along with Moscow, Nizny
Novogrod and, from early 1996, St Petersburg in the Russian Federation.

Although some such as Baltcom in Riga can claim success purely on the
grounds of subscriber numbers - over 8,000 in the Baltic republic's
capital alone - the most lucrative in terms of potential reach and
profitability is undoubtedly Moscow's Kosmos TV. Launched as a joint
venture between ITI and the General Centre for Radio and Television
(GCRT Ostankino) in 1991, it employs three large antennas to receive
Astra, Eutelsat and Intelsat services which are then retransmitted
within a 60-70km radius of the Ostankino TV Tower to the city of Moscow
and several outlying suburbs including Krasnogorsk, Kurkino, Odintsovo,
Peredelkino and Sheremetyevo.

Kosmos TV offers its subscribers - who currently number around 1,500
individuals and institutions such as businesses, hotels and embassies -
a full basic 18-channel 'package A' comprised Eurosport, MTV Europe,
RTL, Bloomberg, Bloomberg News, NBC Super Channel, a recently-launched
Russian film channel known as The New Channel and two services
(Euronews and The Travel Channel) with Russian subtitles for $36.45
(including VAT) per month. Those wishing to receive  the nine-channel
basic 'package B' of Russian and English-language channels, however,
pay $19 (including VAT) a month, while the Adult Channel is available
to all subscribers for an extra $8. Individual subscribers are, in
addition, required to pay a $300 deposit and $60 (plus VAT)
installation charge, while fees for hotels are determined by occupancy
rates.

Unlike most other cable operators in the Russian Federation, Kosmos TV
has full agreements with all the satellite channels it carries. It also
offers subscribers insurance for equipment, its own listings magazine,
a round-the-clock maintenance service and - perhaps more importantly -
a distinct advantage over individual DTH reception, since this would
require a two to 2.5-metre dish costing $1,500 to $3,000 and, for such
channels as BBC Prime, Discovery Channel and MTV Europe, up to $360 for
descrambling equipment.

According to Elvira Smirnova, Kosmos TV's commercial director, the
service would like to add more channels to those it already distributes
but is held back by "technical limitations." If these are overcome "the
number of subscribers will grow accordingly," she says, and may
eventually reach its target of 50,000.

FIRST TO SHOW

Europe's first single-sport subscription channel is covering not
football, but the sport of kings. Julian Clover dons his silks to give
a right royal welcome to The Racing Channel

There can't be too many satellite subscription services which claim Her
Majesty The Queen and other prominent members of Britain's royal family
as regular viewers. But SIS, owner of the Racing Channel, one of the
new crop of UK Astra channels and televisual purveyor of the 'sport of
kings,' boasts exactly this.

Strictly speaking, the Royal household doesn't subscribe to the #20 a
month Astra 1D service, but Britain's first family of the paddock is
the recipient of SIS's sister satellite racing service which is
targeted, predominantly, at bookmakers.

SIS actually began its encrypted (in B Mac) service for UK betting
shops as long ago as 1987, with live horse racing from Chester and
greyhound meetings from Hackney. Now offered to bookmakers and
individual trainers for an annual subscription fee of #5,500, George
Irvine, general manager of The Racing Channel, says when the
professional service first got under starter's orders "we came to an
agreement with Customs and Excise that we wouldn't, because it was a
betting service, sell it to individuals unless we were fairly sure that
they wouldn't start operating a betting shop in their front rooms."

There are now less than 500 such private subscriptions - including the
Royals' - in addition to the 9,500 UK betting shops. Transmissions via
Intelsat's 601 satellite are also received as far afield as Andorra,
North America and Saudi Arabia.

Irvine says that a consumer DTH service had long been under
consideration, but only recently did all the technological elements
fall into place to make the channel a racing certainty. The channel's
introduction was hastened when SIS's feed on Eutelsat I F4 switched to
digital transmissions, allowing additional compressed capacity to
deliver a proposed cable service to headends in the UK.

"We presented it to the cable companies with our thoughts and ideas of
what the service would consist of, the fact it was cable-exclusive, and
how we felt it would be a tremendous benefit to them, and how most of
the customers would be the kind who, through betting, would use
telephony as well. It was a 'double whammy,'" recounts Irvine.

But what was hoped to be a red-hot favourite stalled as cable operators
proved "very, very unreceptive." Irvine ascribes cable operators'
resistance to the channel to "technical problems" experienced with
existing channels.

The Racing Channel's unlikely White Knight turned out to be British Sky
Broadcasting, which came knocking on SIS's door with a proposal to
launch the service direct-to-home via satellite. However, the UK's
dominant pay-TV broadcaster was not able to guarantee SIS the 24-hour
channel it had been hoping for. Instead, it was offered, and accepted,
the daily transmission hours between 11.00 and 16.00 sharing capacity
with Sky Movies Gold on Astra 1D. However, from the summer of '96 The
Racing Channel will be able to extend its output to 19.00, before
returning to a 17.00 closedown in time for the start of the autumn
season.

SIS's cameras are in attendance at every daily race meeting in the UK
and from this wealth of coverage two meetings per day are selected for
the direct-to-home service.

An additional detail in the contract with Sky means SIS now produces
the daily Racing News magazine programme for Sky Sports, while The
Winning Post, another SIS production, returns in the summer on the same
channel with regular coverage of evening race meetings. Also during the
summer months, The Racing Channel will preview evening meetings and
screen the first few races before handing over to Sky Sports for
coverage of the remainder of the card.

Irvine concedes that the present hours are a mite miserly should, for
example, The Racing Channel, wish to screen an entire meeting. However,
since the key race is typically third on the card, coverage of the main
event is virtually guaranteed.

At #20 per month The Racing Channel ranks as the second most expensive
single premium service beamed via the Astra platform - a short head
behind JSTV's #30-a-month Japanese-language channel. Irvine, though,
says the figure should be put into perspective; #20, he says, might not
be quite so outlandish to punters who think nothing of placing bets of
#10 on a single race - though he says the average is closer to #50 -
via a credit or debit card.

"One of the good things is that you can subscribe to The Racing Channel
as a solos subscriber. You don't need to take any of the other
channels, and that was one of the things that we insisted on," says
Irvine. The implication is that BSkyB would have preferred The Racing
Channel's subscribers to have first passed through one of its existing
tiers, most likely Sky Sports.

But as evidence that SIS was correct to stick to its guns, Irvine
claims reports from Sky's subscriber management centre in Livingston
show that the enquiries have been streaming in from non-Sky customers.

The Racing Channel's deal with Sky was not hammered out until the
eleventh hour - last November 2 to be exact, four days before the
channel went live - and the agreement to use Sky's Astra 1D transponder
on the morning of the launch. Pre-launch ballyhoo, as a result, was
kept to a minimum to say the least, though in the time since ads have
regularly appeared in The Sporting Life and The Racing Post. And in
true pay-TV style, a daily clear window between 11.00 and 12.00 alerts
potential subscribers to the service.

In its first fortnight on-air The Racing Channel, Irvine claims,
attracted 20,000 calls and 7,500 switch-ons. Niche audience channels
inevitably attract consumers new to satellite television and this, in
turn, means acquainting them with the technology. The Racing Channel's
task is compounded, says Irvine, by the need among longer-standing
satellite viewers to fit "a new widget" - a reference to the enhanced
LNBs needed by many older IRDs to receive Astra 1D.

Providing such technicalities can be overcome, Irvine is targeting
30,000 subscribers for Year One and 10,000 by 1998. And despite the
original set-back with the UK's cable operators, the channel has even
been given a leg-up into cable by BT's London-based operator
Westminster Cable, which had taken part in some earlier consumer trials
of the channel.

When Sky migrates to digital - a deadline which is not expected to be
met until at least the end of 1996 - then The Racing Channel will
become a 24-hour service as was originally envisaged. But for the
moment, beams Irvine, "we're pleased that it is the first niche sports
channel, and it's racing."

DTH SURVEY:  HOW DOES YOUR MARKET GROW

In a year in which analogue equipment had the market all to itself for
the final time, saturation in Europe's major DTH markets suggests the
time is ripe for digital to take root. C&SEu's sixth annual DTH survey,
researched and compiled by Chris Dziadul

C&SEu's latest annual DTH survey indicates that the European satellite
industry had another successful year in 1995, with the number of
installations in December 1995 totalling around 20.5 million. Yet while
this represented an increase of over 20 per cent on the previous year's
figure, there were doubts in some countries as to how much longer this
growth could continue.

In Germany, for instance, sales had been stagnant for some two years
and dealers were finally being forced to concede that the market -
which already amounted to some nine million DTH and smatv homes - was
effectively saturated. In France, on the other hand, strong growth
could not conceal the fact that the industry was starting from an
extremely low base, while in Poland, which with an estimated 1.7
million dishes was still Europe's third largest market, cheap imports
were having a detrimental effect on sales.

All was not gloom and doom, however. Although BSkyB had had its fair
share of problems in the UK, it finally turned a corner in 1995 by
employing highly successful marketing techniques which helped the
number of installations rise above the 3.5 million mark - effectively a
17 per cent increase on the previous year's total. Other countries
which notched up significant sales included Italy, Belgium and Denmark.

The impact on Europe's DTH industry of Eutelsat's Hot Bird 1 - which is
co-located with ll F1 at 13 degrees East -  could not be understated
and was perhaps most clearly felt in the Russian Federation, where it
finally made viewing of foreign satellite channels a reality for
millions of people living in Moscow and central parts of the country.
Meanwhile in Greece, which had hitherto also been outside the
footprints of most European satellites, the number of installations
almost doubled following the satellite's launch.

Hot Bird also brought home the importance viewers now attach to local-
language programming. Although Astra is still undoubtedly Europe's 'hot
bird,' more and more people are forsaking its English and German-
language channels in favour of programming in their own vernaculars.
This is being offered by several satellites including Telecom 2A and 2B
in France, Turksat in Turkey and one degree West in Scandinavia, while
immigrant communities throughout the continent are increasingly well
served by Eutelsat's programming services.

What has, in addition, become clear is that each country in Europe is a
highly distinct market and developments in it should be viewed with
this in mind. The former communist countries of central and eastern
Europe, for instance, have seen their television industries develop at
widely differing rates over the last five years and this is clearly
reflected in their respective DTH markets. Even the Nordic countries,
which are united by common satellites and the usage of D2 Mac
technology, differ greatly in such areas as growth, with Sweden and
Denmark performing far more impressively than Finland and Norway.

Programming nevertheless remains a key factor in the development of DTH
services throughout Europe and its importance was clearly illustrated
in Belgium, where the sudden availability via satellite of the Dutch
broadcaster Veronica and newcomer SBS 6 contributed to an almost 75 per
cent increase in installations despite the country's high cable
penetration.

Spain, on the other hand, experienced both success and failure in this
field in 1995, with its Astra-delivered Canal Satellite package of
programming finally tasting success after an aggressive marketing
campaign and Cotelsat's four-channel package off of DBS bird Hispasat
collapsing due to lack of promotion, among other things.

Although the UK's Pace has emerged as a clear market-leader in DTH
equipment throughout Europe, its dominance is by no means complete and
is challenged in a number of territories. Cheap imports, however,
continue to trouble several markets, despite the problem being less
severe in some countries - Austria, for instance - than before.

As in previous years, it is instructive to compare growth in Europe's
DTH industry with those of Japan and the US, the world's two other main
satellite dish markets. In the former, satellite penetration of its
43.7 million TV households stood at around 13.7 per cent towards the
end of the year. Meanwhile in the US, the impetus provided by the
recent launch of such DBS services as DirecTv was maintained in 1995,
with the total number of DTH subscribers in October being 4.36 million
and the total number of C-Band dishes almost 3.83 million.

DTH SURVEY:  AUSTRIA

Population:        8.1m
TV homes:          3.035m
VCR homes:         1.75m
Cable connections: 1.17m
Cable penetration: 38%
Dish total:        300,000-500,000 (700,000)

Austria's DTH industry had a largely indifferent year in 1995, with few
if any distributors recording significant increases in sales of dishes.
There were nevertheless some important developments that offered a
valuable insight into how the market was likely to develop.

The cost of equipment, for instance, continued to fall and by the end
of the year the cheapest Astra systems - which employed 60cm dishes in
western parts of the country, rising to 80cm in Vienna and further east
- retailed for as little as oSch1,290 (#82). More typically, 80cm
models usually fetched up to oSch5,000 and motorised units around
oSch10,000.

Yet despite this, there was a movement away from sales of cheap 'black
imports' from such Asian countries as China and South Korea back to
more expensive equipment produced in the European Union (EU). Indeed,
companies such as Pace and Hirschmann, which had previously dominated
the quality end of the market, began to make significant inroads into
its mainstream.

While ascertaining the size of the market remained difficult -
estimates of the total number of dishes ranged from 300,000 to half a
million - most industry sources believed Eutelsat programming (thanks
largely to Hot Bird) was becoming increasingly popular in the country.

DTH SURVEY:  BELGIUM

Population:        10.2m
TV homes:          4.141m
VCR homes:         1.91m
Cable connections: 3.99m
Cable penetration: 96%
Dish total:        35,000 (20,000)

Belgium's high cable penetration did not prevent its hitherto small DTH
market almost doubling in size in 1995. The reasons for this were
twofold: the popularity of Eutelsat's Hot Bird and - perhaps more
importantly - the dramatic increase of programming available to Flemish
speakers via Veronica and SBS 6.

With sales of equipment to the country's immigrant Moroccan and Turkish
communities having peaked, the focus of attention once more passed to
the local population. Still effectively split along linguistic lines -
with French speakers in Wallonia opting for programming on Telecom and
Astra being the first choice for Flemish speakers - it saw the cost of
systems fall by around 15 per cent. As a result, typical Astra models
with 80cm dishes, along with 90cm Telecom equipment, typically retailed
for between BFr5,950 and BFr11,900 (#129-259).

With now no domestic manufacturing sector to speak of, all DTH
equipment was supplied by foreign companies. Several, including Amstrad
and Echostar, were well represented at the quality end of the market,
while Germany's Lasat performed well in sales of lower priced hardware.

Cable connections: 60,000 (min est)
Cable penetration: 3% (min est)
Dish total:        N/A (50,000 est)

In the absence of a national commercial television service and a cable
industry still waiting on the starting blocks, Bulgaria's DTH market
had another good year in '95. Indeed, although industry sources were
unable to provide an accurate figure for the total number of dishes in
the country, it was believed to be well in excess of the 1994 figure of
50,000.

Astra programming could be received with equipment employing 1.5-metre
dishes in the western part of the country, rising to over three metres
on the Black Sea coast, which - if using increasingly popular Russian
ex-military dishes - typically retailed for around $325 (#206).
Eutelsat's Hot Bird, however, had become an instant hit and could be
picked up anywiere with generally cheaper systems (including receivers
costing around #63) which employed 1.2 metre dishes (80cm in Sofia).
Furthermore, services carried on other Eutelsat satellites remained
popular with the country's large Turkish-speaking community.

Although Pace equipment was highly regarded, its price put it beyond
the reach of most Bulgarians. However, there was a wide range of
foreign-made systems on the market and the end users' cost could often
be negotiated.

Dish total:        N/A (N/A)

Although there was still no reliable figure for the total number of
dishes in the CIS, it was widely believed that the market stood on the
threshold of great change. The reason for this was the availability of
programming hitherto difficult if not impossible to receive in the
territory: Eutelsat had reduced the dish size required to pick-up its
signals from three metres to 90cm following the launch of Hot Bird 1,
while Astra 1D's footprint was such that its programming services could
be viewed in Moscow with 75cm equipment.

With monitoring at borders kept to a minimum, there was a large influx
of illegally-imported DTH equipment from western Europe, the Middle
East, China and other parts of Asia.

Pace nevertheless remained one of the leading distributors of receiving
equipment in the country.

Cable penetration: negligible
Dish total:        200,000 (400,000 max est)

Croatia's DTH market in late 1995 appeared to be smaller than
previously believed, but it still amounted to around 200,000
installations - an impressive penetration rate of over 23 per cent -
and sales were increasing. This could largely be put down to an almost
complete absence of cable services in the country, except in the towns
of Karlovac, Split and the capital, Zagreb, along with a terrestrial
sector dominated by the national publicly-owned broadcaster Hrvatska
Televizija (HRT) and, following a new media communication law, awaiting
the launch of national and regional commercial services.

Channels on Astra and Eutelsat's Hot Bird accounted for most of the
country's satellite viewing, with systems for the former employing 60-
90cm dishes, typically retailing for #146. While there was no market-
leader, models produced by Pace, Provision and Grundig continued to
sell well.

The trends which have recently manifested themselves in Norway's DTH
industry dominated by the Ostrava-based operator Cable Plus. Indeed,
some industry sources put the number of DTH installations in the
country in late 1995 at 600,000 - effectively a 50 per cent increase on
the previous year's total.

Astra still remained popular in the Czech Republic and could be
received with systems employing 60cm dishes almost anywhere in the
country and typically retailed for CKr7,000 (#169). Eutelsat equipment
cost a similar amount, while motorised systems were more expensive.

As in previous years, although there were no clear market-leaders both
Pace and Amstrad remained popular.

Population:        5.2m
TV homes:          2.266m
VCR homes:         1.45m
Cable connections: 1.359m (incl smatv)
Cable penetration: 60% (incl smatv)
Dish total:        Up to 300,000 (100,000 min est)

Denmark's DTH market experienced tremendous growth in 1995 and was by
the end of the year believed to number up to 300,000 installations. Of
these, aroune two thirds were accounted for by D2 Mac receiving
systems.

One reason for this increase in sales was the success of the pan-Scandi
satellite venture NSD, which effectively provided Danish cable and DTH
viewers with a realistic alternative to services carried by Astra.
While the latter remained attractive to viewers, channels on the one
degree West platform (which included TV3) rapidly gained in popularity.

The market was also given a boost by a significant fall in the cost of
equipment, with D2 Mac systems employing 70cm dishes, for instance,
typically retailing from DKr2,495-3,495 (#288-404). Those capable of
receiving both Astra and NSD services, meanwhile, cost around DKr4,000
if specifically designed to do so and DKr4,500 if they combined two
70cm dishes. Although Pal systems also continued to fall in price, they
remained far less popular.

As in previous years, Pace was the market-leader and Triax, Nokia and
Bang & Olufsen were also well represented.

DTH SURVEY:  ESTONIA

Population:        1.5m
TV homes:          492,000
VCR homes:         26,076
Cable connections: 123,000
Cable penetration: 25% (max est)
Dish total:        21,000 (18,000 max est)

Estonia maintained its position as one of the Baltic region's leading
television markets in 1995, recording significant growth in both its
terrestrial and cable industries. As in previous years, it also saw a
sharp rise in the number of DTH homes: although the previous year's
figure was overestimated, the late 1995 total of 21,000 represented an
increase in real terms of 40 per cent.

Astra was the most watched satellite but faced stiff competition from
Eutelsat and Russia's Gorizont. Indeed, the top five satellite channels
received either by cable or DTH in the country were - according to
National Media Survey - Pro 7, ORT, RTL, MTV Europe and Eurosport.

The typical cost of DTH equipment -which usually employed a 1.8-metre
antenna and Pal receiver - was little changed at around EEK9,000 (#500)
and Pace, Finlux and Nokia/Salora remained the market-leaders.

DTH SURVEY:  FINLAND

Population:        5.1m
TV homes:          2.081m
VCR homes:         1.352m
Cable connections: 749,000 (est)
Cable penetration: 36%
Dish total:        50,000 (30,000)

The size of Finland's DTH market was revised upwards for the second
year running, though industry sources indicated there had been little
if any increase in sales in 1995. There was, however, an important
change in viewing habits as viewers began to switch from Astra to
Eutelsat's Hot Bird and the CTV package at one degree West.

Besides offering attractive programming, both new services could be
received with competitively priced equipment: systems with one-metre
dishes were sufficient to pick-up Hot Bird almost anywhere in the
country and typically retailed for FM1,200-1,900 (#178-292), while the
end-user cost of 70cm CTV models was FM1,900-2,900. Astra's decline in
popularity was nevertheless expected to be temporary, with several
digital services on its forthcoming 1E satellite likely to target
Scandinavian audiences.

In the absence of a local manufacturing industry - Nokia having shifted
production of both Pal and Mac receivers to Sweden - sales of equipment
were effectively confined to foreign-made systems. Pace and Nokia
(along with its brand names Salora and Finlux) each accounted for 30
per cent of the market, with several other companies the remainder.

DTH SURVEY:  FRANCE

Population:        58.1m
TV homes:          20.896m
VCR homes:         13.352m
Cable connections: 2.131m
Cable penetration: 10.2%
Dish total:        1m (min est) (385,000 est)

France's hitherto small DTH market caught up on lost time in 1995, with
one industry source estimating the number of dishes in the country at
the half-year point to be at least one million. It also put total sales
of equipment at 270,000 in 1994 and expected the figure to rise to
350,000 in 1995.

One reason for this impressive growth was demand from France's large
foreign community: Arabic, Spanish, English, Italian, German and Polish-
speakers all found programming on Eutelsat - and in particular Hot Bird
 - increasingly attractive, and by some estimates accounted for between
50 and 60 per cent of dish sales. Astra, on the other hand, was
considered by most of the French viewing public to be too geared
towards English and German-language speakers, with most still plumping
for Telecom satellites.

The latter (Telecom 2A and 2B) could be received with equipment which
typically retailed for Fr2,000 (#259), whereas Astra systems usually
cost less. As in previous years, the market-leaders included Philips
and Nokia.

Although it was expected dish sales in France in 1996 would reach
470,000, the effect on the market of Canal Plus's digital Astra package
remained hard to predict.

DTH SURVEY:  GERMANY

Population:        81.7m
TV homes:          32.149m
VCR homes:         18.968m
Cable connections: 15.491m
Cable penetration: 48.1%
Dish total:        9.23m (DTH & smatv) (7.71m, max est-DTH only)

Following two years of disappointing sales, dealers believed Germany's
DTH market had finally reached saturation point. Indeed, in a country
with over 14 million cabled homes and at least nine million served by
DTH or smatv, most were agreed that everyone who wanted to watch
satellite television now had the means to do so.

The slowdown in dish sales was uniform throughout Germany and not - as
first believed - confined to the more cabled, western part of the
country. It was also reflected in the cost of equipment, with the
cheapest 60cm Astra systems retailing for as little as #60-70 and dual
Astra/Eutelsat models (which usually employed 85cm dishes and two LNBs)
fetching #100.

With DTH equipment costing so little, imports from the Far East which
had previously made strong inroads into the market no longer had the
edge. As in previous years, producers of high-quality kit such as
Kathrein, Technisat and Pace maintained a strong presence in the
country.

DTH SURVEY:  GREECE

Population:        10.5m
TV homes:          3.161m
VCR homes:         1.58m
Cable connections: 1,900
Cable penetration: 0.06%
Dish total:        5,000 (est) (3,000)

Greece's small DTH market received a welcome boost in 1995 with the
launch of Eutelsat's Hot Bird and a fall in the cost of equipment. As a
result, there were around 5,000 systems in the country at the end of
the year (compared to 3,000 in late 1994) and sales were buoyant.

Signals from the new Eutelsat satellite - on which Eurosport was the
most popular channel - could be received almost anywhere in the country
with systems employing 80cm dishes. These usually retailed for between
#160-#226, whereas those used to pick-up other satellites could cost
anything from #400 (1.2-metres) to #2,700 (for the most expensive three-
metre model). Reception nevertheless remained a problem, with Greece's
geographical location effectively limiting Astra viewing to Corfu and
the north, and requiring 1.8-metre systems to watch Intelsat in Crete
and western parts of the country.

While there was still no market-leader, equipment supplied by Pace,
Amstrad and Echostar remained popular. Drake, Hirschmann and Kathrein,
however, continued to dominate sales of more expensive models.

DTH SURVEY:  HUNGARY

Population:        10.2m
TV homes:          3.8m
VCR homes:         1.596m
Cable connections: 1.52m
Cable penetration: 40%
Dish total:        400,000 (max est) (190,000)

Previous estimates of the size of Hungary's DTH market appeared to have
been incorrect, with industry sources believing the number of dishes in
the country in late 1995 to be up to 400,000. Although this was almost
double the previous year's total, it was widely felt there had been
little if any growth in the market during the period.

There was also an acceptance that the country's television industry was
on the threshold of great change: a long-awaited broadcasting bill
seemed imminent and was likely to be followed by the launch of a
national commercial television service. How this would affect its DTH
and cable industries - the latter being one of the largest in central
and eastern Europe - remained far from clear.

The non-terrestrial sector had nevertheless been given a boost during
the previous year by the launch of MultiChoice Hungary. In late 1995
subscribers could receive the basic package - upon payment of Fts35,000-
45,000 (#167-215) for hardware and a connection fee of Fts5,200 - for
Fts29,990 a month. Both Astra and Eutelsat programming remained popular
in the country, with systems employing 0.9 to three-metre dishes
ranging in price from #71-#390. Although there were no clear market-
leaders, equipment produced by several companies, including Pace,
Amstrad, Neuhaus, Radix and Echostar, continued to sell well.

TV homes:          93,595
VCR homes:         49,500 (est)
Cable connections: 1,216 (min est)
Cable penetration: 1.3%
Dish total:        3,000 (max est) (2,500)

The number of dishes in Iceland grew steadily in 1995 and at the end of
the year stood at around 3,000. Although this represented an impressive
increase of up to 20 per cent on the previous year's total, industry
sources were far from optimistic as to the future.

The key to any further growth in the market rested firmly with
programming: while the introduction of microwave relays of foreign
channels by Stod 2 had failed to dampen sales of DTH equipment and the
prospect of the PTT offering cable services still seemed distant, most
people felt the (legal) viewing choice on offer was limited.

Nor was their view likely to be altered by the cost of equipment in a
market in which - despite the presence of such companies as Pace and
Echostar - there was still no dominant supplier. Indeed, 1995 saw
typical 1.2-metre Astra systems with IRDs fall in price by IKr5,000
(#49) from IKr60,000 to IKr55,000, while 1.8-metre systems normally
used to receive such channels as CNN and (illegally) Sky Sports also
dropped in price by a similar amount to IKr110,000. Neither had the
effect of raising the total annual sales beyond 300 to 500
installations.

VCR homes:         623,040
Cable connections: 401,280
Cable penetration: 38%
Dish total:        66,000 (min est) (60,000)

Ireland's DTH market shrugged off high cable penetration, widespread
MMDS distribution and the illegal retransmission of foreign channels to
record significant growth for the second year running. This was in part
due to a large influx of illegally-imported equipment and the
widespread use of pirate cards.

Viewing patterns were little altered, however, with Astra programming
by far the most popular and neither Eutelsat or Intelsat being able to
secure a large audience. The cost of equipment was also little changed
on 1994: the cheapest Astra models with 80cm dishes typically retailed
for IR#199 (#194.6), while more expensive systems could fetch up to
IR#350.

Pace remained the market-leader, with several other manufacturers
including Lenson Heath and Grundig represented.

Israel's cable industry had another highly successful year in 1995,
with the number of connected homes rising to over 840,000 (effectively
70 per cent penetration). Most were offered six Hebrew-language
channels, over 25 foreign services and home shopping.

Yet despite this, the country's small DTH market not only held its own
but recorded an increase in sales. Industry sources believed it
numbered around 5,000 systems in late 1995: most belonged to Arabs
resident in the Occupied Territories or Israel proper and were used to
receive programming via Eutelsat, Asiasat and Arabsat, with the
latter's Arab Radio and Television (ART) being especially popular.

Equipment employing 0.9-metre dishes typically retailed for NS1,500
(#314), while 1.1-metre systems cost an additional NS200 and motorised
units could fetch up to NS3,500. All prices included both VAT and
installation. As in previous years, Pace remained the clear market-
leader at the medium-to-high end of the market and no single company
dominated sales of lower-priced equipment.

Dish total:        600,000 (est) (120,000 min est)

Italy's DTH market grew significantly for the second year running in
1995, with some industry sources putting the number of dishes in the
country at up to 600,000. It also looked forward to a period of further
growth following the 1996 launch of Hot Bird 2 - which will boost sales
in southern parts of the country by allowing reception with 85cm dishes
- and Telepiu's move onto satellite.

Astra and Eutelsat's Hot Bird were the most watched satellites in the
country at the end of the year and could usually be received with 85cm
systems, which ranged in price from between Lire300,000-550,000 (#119-
219) for single and Lire450,000-700,000 for double feeds. 1.2-metre
motorised units, however, could fetch anything up to Lire2.8 million.

As in previous years, the principal suppliers of DTH equipment included
Nokia, Pace, Fracarro, Echostar and Emmesse.

No accurate figure for the total number of dishes in Latvia in late
1995 was available,  though some industry sources estimated there could
be almost 25,000, giving a penetration rate of almost two per cent.
What was clear, however, was that growth in the industry continued to
be held back by the country's expanding terrestrial sector and -
perhaps more importantly - the success of the Riga-based MMDS service
Baltcom. Backed by the US company International Telecell Inc (ITI) and
local interests, it offered at least 8,000 subscribers in the city and
environs 24 channels in three packages.

Some industry sources believed the previous year's total of 265,000 to
be an overestimate. With continued expansion of terrestrial services
and a cable industry estimated to number up to 70,000 connections,
however, there was undoubtedly general growth in the country's
television market and, most probably, dish sales, though no reliable
figure was available.

While programming carried by Astra and Intelsat remained popular,
Eutelsat's Hot Bird made viewing of satellite channels financially more
accessible to the public and was likely to eventually result in the
same growth in the DTH industry as in the neighbouring Russian
Federation.

Luxembourg's DTH market continued to expand in 1995, though industry
sources believed the territory's high cable penetration was likely to
limit further growth for the foreseeable future.

As in previous years, programming supplied by Astra - whose operator
SES is based in the Grand Duchy - continued to dominate viewing and
could be received with equipment which retailed for as little as
FLux4,000 (#87). More expensive motorised systems, on the other hand,
could be bought from around FLux17,500. While Alfa J Weirich Sar
remained the country's only DTH manufacturer, several foreign companies
including Grundig were strongly represented in the local market.

Although the launch of several new channels on satellite, including
SBS6, TV10 Gold and a revamped Veronica, made 1995 an eventful year for
Dutch broadcasting, sales of DTH equipment remained sluggish due to the
country's already high cable penetration. Moreover, they were not
expected to increase significantly in the near future despite Nethold's
plans to target the country with digital pay-per-view.

The Netherlands' large Turkish and Moroccan immigrant communities
continued to account for most low-cost equipment sales, with many
models being used to receive channels carried by Eutelsat and - to a
lesser extent - Arabsat and Intelsat. The cheapest Astra and Eutelsat
models usually employed 60-80cm dishes and typically retailed for
Gld200-300 (#79-119). While Pace remained the market-leader, Amstrad
and Echostar both had a significant market share and Philips continued
to enjoy a degree of success.

The trends which have recently manifested themselves in Norway's DTH
market - namely a switch from motorised to fixed systems and a
significant fall in prices - continued almost unabated in 1995. The
latter was to some degree spurred on by the success of the one degree
West package, which prompted MultiChoice to enter into an agreement
with Pace that resulted in hardware becoming available to the pay
channel's subscribers for as little as NKr3,000 (#304). This cost
eventually became the norm for multi-Mac equipment and represented a 66
per cent reduction on 1994 price levels.

Although Nokia remained the market-leader, Pace's deal with FilmNet
strengthened its presence in the country and several other companies,
including Philips, remained well represented. The local manufacturers
Stop and Tantec, however, remained largely on the sidelines.

Dish total:        1.7m (max est) (1.5m max est)

While Poland maintained its position as Europe's third largest DTH
market in 1995, it continued to be troubled by a development that took
place in February of the previous year. The event in question was the
government's decision to impose a 10 per cent 'luxury tax' on all
Polish-made systems (15 per cent on imports) and inadvertently plunge
the whole local industry into a crisis. Besides creating a black market
that accounted for at least 70 per cent of all DTH equipment sold in
the country, its action led to a fall in the number of official dealers
and left those remaining uncertain about their future.

Their predicament was clearly borne out by the cost of equipment, with
the cheapest Astra systems sold - typically for around Zl440 (#113.4) -
being equivalent in price to illegally-imported Pace models.

Yet while the market continued to grow, the halcyon days of the early
1990s were clearly over: more choice of local-language programming led
to Astra gradually losing viewers to terrestrial services and - perhaps
more significantly - Eutelsat. Indeed, at the end of the year
Eutelsat's share of the market (thanks largely to Hot Bird) had risen
to 10 per cent and industry sources predicted it could reach 50 per
cent if more Polish-language channels became available.

With Pace equipment still popular at the higher price end of the
market, and no one supplier dominating sales of cheaper models, the
time seemed right for a local company to enter the fray.

Poznan-based Astra-TV took the plunge by producing the country's first
integrated satellite receiver-positioner and - following the launch of
other new products - aimed to eventually capture up to 70 per cent of
the local market.

There was little agreement on the fortunes of Portugal's DTH market in
1995, with some dealers believing it had finally turned the corner
after bearing the brunt of the country's economic recession and others
feeling it was still far from out of the woods. What was clear,
however, was that it faced growing competition from both the
terrestrial sector and newly-emerging cable industry.

Although Astra remained popular, it too faced competition from
Eutelsat's Hot Bird, which, arguably, offered Portuguese viewers more
interesting programming. Both could be received with 85cm systems
costing as little as Esc20,000 (#85), though more typically Esc50,000.
Combined Eutelsat/Astra models employed 1.1-metre dishes and could be
bought for a little extra.

As in previous years, Antel and Famavel remained the leading local

Contera, Televes, Grundig, Prosat and TV Babo.

DTH SURVEY:  ROMANIA

Population:        22.7m
TV homes:          7.277m
VCR homes:         1.164m (min est)
Cable connections: 1.797m
Cable penetration: 24.7% (max est)
Dish total:        300,000 (est) (300,000 max est)

Although Romanian dealers were unable to provide a figure for the total
number of DTH installations in the country in late 1995,  it was likely
to be only slightly higher than the previous year's maximum estimate of
300,000. While Hot Bird had undoubtedly had a positive impact on the
market, the impressive growth which followed the overthrow of
Ceausescu's regime in 1989 had long ended and domestic television
services were transformed beyond all recognition. Indeed, besides
having a vibrant terrestrial sector served by a growing number of local
commercial stations, the country had one of the largest cable
industries in the whole of central and eastern Europe, with some
estimates putting the number of connections at up to 1.8 million.

DTH SURVEY:  SERBIA & MONTENEGRO

Population:        10.8m
TV homes:          2m (min est)
VCR homes:         1.6m (min est)
Cable connections: 150,000 (max est)
Cable penetration: 7.5% (max est)
Dish total:        200,000 (135,000)

Serbia and Montenegro's DTH market showed further signs of growth in
1995 and at the end of the year stood at around 200,000 installations.

Although Astra programming remained extremely popular, Eutelsat's Hot
Bird was watched by a significant number of viewers and both Intelsat
and Turksat also had large followings.

The cheapest Astra models (which accounted for up to 80 per cent of the
market) retailed for as little as DM250-300 (#112-135), while Hot Bird
systems (some 20 per cent of sales) were motorised and fetched DM600-
700. Although as in previous years there was no overall market-leader,
Neuhausat, Teletronik, Telemax and Protek were well represented in
sales of receivers and Cambridge of LNBs.

Slovakia's television industry has been slower to develop than that of
most other former communist countries in central and eastern Europe,
but the recent award of a national commercial licence is likely to have
a positive effect on its future.

In the absence of such a service, however, both the country's cable and
satellite industries have prospered and in late 1995 there were at
least 350,000 cable connections and 100,000 DTH homes. The latter could
receive both Astra and Eutelsat programming (including Hot Bird) using
equipment which typically retailed for SKr10-11,000 (#214-236).

While there were still no market-leaders, systems including receivers
supplied by Pace were increasingly favoured.

Although the previous year's figure for the total number of dishes in
Slovenia appeared to be an underestimate, most industry sources felt
the market had finally reached saturation point. Indeed, hampered by a
rapidly expanding cable and terrestrial sector, along with high duties
and a tide of illegally-imported equipment, it was likely to remain in
the doldrums for some time to come.

With the number of installations believed to be up to 150,000, however,
Slovenia could still boast an impressive satellite penetration rate of
some 23 per cent. Astra remained popular and could be received with 80-
85cm equipment which - if bought on the black market - retailed for as
little as DM280 (#126), rising to DM350 including installation in the
case of legal low-cost models. Eutelsat systems also employed 85cm
dishes and cost slightly more, while Italian channels on Intelsat could
be received with motorised 1.2-metre systems typically costing around
DM1,300.

While there was still no market-leader, equipment supplied by Pace,
Echostar and Technisat continued to sell well.

DTH SURVEY:  SPAIN

Population:        39.1m
TV homes:          11.721m
VCR homes:         6.751m
Cable connections: 1.172m
Cable penetration: 10%
Dish total:        225,000 (min est) (210,000 max est)

1995 was a year of mixed fortunes for the Spanish DTH market. On the
one hand it could reflect on the success of Astra's Canalsatelite
package - which thanks to aggressive marketing passed the 25,000
subscriber mark - and look forward to Hispasat's plans to launch a
string of digital services in the near future. On the other, it had to
face up to the abysmal failure of the Cotelsat subscriber management
consortium, which managed to secure only 4,000 subscribers for its four-
channel Hispasat package before collapsing in the summer.

Although it was hoped a local DTH market would eventually emerge, sales
of equipment were still largely confined to the country's large
expatriate community. Many continued to favour programming on Astra,
which could be received with 60cm systems in the north, rising to 80cm
in the central region and 1.5-metres in the south, and - due to strong
competition - retailed for as little as Ptas49,000 (#254) in such towns
as Malaga, though up to Ptas100,000 in places with fewer foreign
residents. Scandinavians, however, generally opted to watch a wider
variety of programming, including channels carried by the new, highly-
successful one degree West satellite.

While there was still no market-leader, in the country, Pace and
several minor brand names were all well represented.

DTH SURVEY:  SWEDEN

Population:        8.9m
TV homes:          3.983m
VCR homes:         2.87m
Cable connections: 1.852m
Cable penetration: 46.5%
Dish total:        475,000 (max est) (385,000)

Sales of DTH equipment remained strong in Sweden in 1995 despite the
country's high cable and smatv penetration. They were nevertheless
influenced by a train of events that got under way in August 1994 with
the launch of the Sirius package.

Offering four Pal channels (TV3, TV4, TV6 and ZTV) in-the-clear, the
services provided a boost for sales of compatible equipment until an
announcement in mid-1995 which revealed that they would all soon be
encrypted. This effectively spelt the end of stand-alone Pal reception
equipment market in Sweden and by late 1995 sales were almost entirely
confined to Mac systems.

Costs were little changed on 1994, however, with standard D2 Mac
equipment retailing for around SKr4,000 (#381) including VAT. More
popular Nordic package systems (one degree West and five degrees East)
including a 70cm dish and double LNB, however, fetched between SKr4,500-
5,000.

Figures released by the Swedish Association of Antenna Suppliers (CANT)
indicated that Finnish manufacturer Nokia and its associate companies
had a market share of up to 41 per cent. Other suppliers which were
strongly represented in the Swedish marketplace included Triax,
Amstrad, Philips and Pace.

DTH SURVEY:  SWITZERLAND

Population:        7m
TV homes:          2.581m
VCR homes:         1.677m
Cable connections: 2.039m
Cable penetration: 79%
Dish total:        100,000 (min est) (40,000)

Most industry sources felt Switzerland's DTH market was larger than
previously believed - with some estimates putting the total number of
dishes in the country at up to 120,000 - but they could not agree on
whether it was growing or relatively static.

Those serving the French-speaking community - effectively 40 per cent
of the population - nevertheless had some cause for optimism: besides
being able to reflect on the success of Telecom, they could look
forward to the launch of Canal Plus on Astra in early 1996.

Yet, while Eutelsat also had a large following (especially among the
country's expatriate communities), Astra channels remained the most
popular and could be received with 80cm systems which retailed for at
least SFr300 (#168). More expensive systems, however, could cost
viewers up to SFr1,200.

In the absence of a local production industry, several foreign
companies were well represented in Switzerland's DTH market. They
included Pace, Echostar and Technisat.

DTH SURVEY:  TURKEY

Population:        61.4m
TV homes:          15m
VCR homes:         1.485m
Cable connections: 735,000
Cable penetration: 4.9%
Dish total:        160,000 (min est) (80,000)

Sales of DTH systems rose significantly in Turkey in 1995 and towards
the end of the year were peaking at around 100,000 a month. Although
they were largely confined to rural areas and coincided with the
increased seasonal buying power of the local population, they also
pointed to a number of important developments in the Turkish market.

The most important of these was undoubtedly the rising popularity of
Turksat, which offered viewers over 10 Turkish-language channels,
including the pay-TV service Cine 5. Both these and Eutelsat's Turkish
services attracted a growing audience outside the main cities, which
were already served by numerous terrestrial broadcasters.

The cost of equipment, though little changed on 1994, also attracted
buyers from Syria, Iraq and Iran who subsequently supplied the DTH
markets of their countries. The cheapest Turksat equipment employed a
60cm dish and usually retailed for around $200 (including cable and
installation), while Hot Bird (90cm/1.2-metre) and general Eutelsat
(1.2/1.5-metre) systems cost more.

Cost was in fact the determining factor and as a result there was no
clear market-leader. However, receivers produced in the Far East by
Galaxy and Calibre sold well, while Raster and Laser Merih remained
among the country's own leading dish manufacturers.

DTH SURVEY:  UK

Population:        58.6m
TV homes:          22.402m
VCR homes:         16.488m
Cable connections: 3.181m (incl smatv)
cable penetration: 14.2% (incl smatv)
Dish total:        3.504m (3m)

The UK's DTH market ended 1995 on a strong note, with figures released
by Continental Research indicating that the number of installations in
the country had risen to over 3.5 million - effectively a 17 per cent
increase on the previous year's total.

This welcome upturn in what was, despite a recent slowdown in sales,
Europe's second largest DTH market could largely be put down to the
highly successful marketing techniques employed by BSkyB. While one in
three UK sales were admittedly to replace existing systems, viewers
could buy a receiver and dish for as little as #99 plus #30
installation (the former normally cost between #150-250) providing they
agreed to subscribe to the whole Sky package - including premium movie
and sports channels - for #24.99 a month. As a further incentive, they
were also given access to free sports and movies channels for six
months after signing up.

The UK market was also buoyed by the launch of several new channels
into Sky's 'basic' Multi-Channels tier. The introduction of Sci-Fi
channel, The History Channel, Sky Sports Gold, Paramount TV and
European Business News (EBN) to the Astra-delivered package brought
with it an increase from #9.99 per month to #10.99, but this didn't
seem to deter the market. New premium services Playboy, The Racing
Channel and The Disney Channel, which was offered free to subscribers
to Sky's film channels, also created extra publicity and marketing
support for the UK's main 'dish-driver.'

While Pace remained the market-leader, it faced strong competition from
several other companies, including Grundig Satellite Communications.
The latter had enjoyed considerable success since its launch in early
1994, while Amstrad, which at one time was the leading player in the
industry, continued to experience a downturn in its fortunes.

While the cost of analogue DTH equipment was significantly down on
previous years, the predicted price of digital receivers  - a hefty
#400-500 - was seen as a factor in BSkyB's decision to delay the
introduction of digital satellite television services, probably until
late 1996 or 1997.

47 VARIETIES

By applying the logic of digital to analogue Astra transponder 47,
reports Julian Clover, Sky has been improving its standing in
Continental Research's Star Report

Just how many channels is it possible to squeeze into a single
transponder? This is not a question involving bit rates for the
imminent digital era, but one which remains firmly in the analogue
domain, at least as far as Sky is concerned.

Astra transponder 47 is home to a fistful of Sky television services;
Sky Soap, Sky Travel, The History Channel, Sci-Fi Channel, Sky Sports
Gold, Sky Sports 2 and the 'non-aligned' Christian Channel. All are
proudly described by Sky as 'channels,' though only Sky Sports 2 is on-
air for a period longer than 16 hours - and that for only two
consecutive days. Some of these 'programme streams' are either owned or
controlled by BSkyB, while others, such as Sci-Fi, are merely sitting
tenants, albeit for only several hours at a time.

However, the sum of these various parts amounts to a more than
respectable, if variable product. The popularity of Sky Sports 2, for
instance, rests largely on whether its full-time sister channel is
screening an event which requires its normal football coverage to be
shunted across. And as BSkyB racks up the rights to more and more
events in the sporting calendar - Endsleigh league football has become
the latest - then Sports 2 will enjoy a greater share of the
recognition.

Sports though isn't the only audience-grabber on transponder 47; co-
habitor Sci-Fi has been performing remarkably well for a channel which
has only nine weekly hours of prime-time. A round-the-clock version is
available  for cable viewers only via Eutelsat, but this is not audited
by Continental Research's Star Report.

Sci-Fi Channel's opening programme, Inside Space, ranks ninth in the
list of top-rated transponder 47 programmes, while its first big movie,
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, came in at fifth position, despite
having been aired on several occasions by terrestrial television. The
audience level for Khan and, to a lesser extent, Alien are on a par
with movies screened by UK Gold - which, arguably, has the best crop of
movies of any basic channel.

The History Channel also has an audience to be proud of; at 109,000 its
top-rated programme would not look out of place in The Discovery
Channel's top 10, which begs the question what could it achieve if its
transmission hours were extended beyond 19.00?

Outside of the all-singing, all-dancing transponder 47, the other
newcomers to Sky's tiers have enjoyed a mixed response. Bravo's noon-to-
midnight cult television service is now sandwiched between business
news channel EBN (06.00-12.00) and Playboy channel (00.00-04.00).

EBN's audience is hard to quantify; by its very nature most of its
viewing takes place in City dealing rooms. But it also has a 24-hour
feed on Eutelsat Hot Bird 1, allowing direct-to-home viewing and, more
importantly cable retransmission, which is not necessarily included in
Bravo's viewing combo. The rows of zeros notched up by EBN during its
daily Astra transmission hours also belies an upswing in the number of
ABC1 viewers to Bravo's Astra transponder.

CAPE BLAZE HITS DSTV ROLL-OUT

A SERIOUS fire at the Cape Town factory producing Panasonic MPEG-2/DVB
receivers for MultiChoice's recently-launched DSTV service has worsened
an already severe shortage of boxes.

The fire, started by an electrical fault, caused R30 million (#5.31
million) worth of damage, destroying the production line from which
Panasonic was hoping to deliver 35,000 digital boxes before the end of
the year.

According to MultiChoice general manager, marketing, Cobus Scholtz,
Panasonic is hoping to restore full production by the end of January:
but he confirmed the fire had "severely affected" early roll-out
targets for the 16-channel DTH service.

Although Pace has pledged to step-up deliveries to supply "20-25,000"
DSTV receivers before Christmas, Scholtz said, "We had hoped to have
that many in the market right now." To date, he said, some 5,500 Pace
units had been delivered, along with "two to three thousand" from
Panasonic. Because of the shortages, MultiChoice is in talks with the
consortium launching a German-language digital package for Africa, with
a view to joint marketing of a Grundig digital IRD suitable for both
services. Rumours that Nokia boxes might also be shipped in to relieve
the crisis were dismissed: "Not true," Scholtz said, "not yet."

IRD SHORTAGES HIT UK TRADE

DESPITE Pace's efforts to boost output of analogue IRDs, the UK trade
reported serious shortages continuing into the peak pre-Christmas sales
season.

Pace said it had pulled out all the stops to up volume, with output of
analogue IRDs 30 per cent up on the same period last year. As a short-
term measure it resumed production of the old PRD800 receiver, with
scarcity of essential silicon the chief factor limiting MSS range
output.

The knock-on effect has left other manufacturers struggling to keep up
with demand. At least one brand - Maspro - sold out completely, with md
Chris Lack explaining that the last batch of Maspro ST8 MkII IRDs had
gone by mid-November: the stock was supposed to last until March.

Distributor Satellite Solutions' md Grant Lester reported "a
significant shortage... I've got five times more orders than stock.
Everything is pre-sold."  Grundig's Keith Armour confirmed that under-
supply was still a problem in the first weeks of December: "We've met
all our orders, but the problem is that people are looking to us to
fill the gap in the pipeline," he said. "The market's doing better than
any of us expected. Quarter Four '95 is up on '94 and '93 - it's the
best in the last three years."

PACE DEALERS GO FOR GOLD

PACE is backing the debut of digital satellite television in the Far
East and Middle East with the launch of the Pace Gold Club. The concept
will provide dealers with a complete service support and marketing
package with the goal of developing maximum market penetration in the
shortest possible time. The Gold Club will be extended to other areas
including Europe as digital television services become established.

Leading retailers will also qualify for status as a Diamond Dealer,

BT OPENS UK UPLINK FOR PAS-4

BT HAS inaugurated a new uplink site at Martlesham, Suffolk to uplink
services to the PAS-4 satellite. "The PAS-4 look angle is so low so you
have to go east as far as you can," explained head of broadcast
services John Swingewood. "The best site we had was our research centre
at Martlesham Heath, where the original Sky uplink was sited."

BT has installed 16 and 13-metre antennas, one for C-Band and the other
for Ku-Band at a cost of over #3 million. "We don't spend that kind of
money unless we are confident that there is a market," said Swingewood.
The facility will be used for coverage of Asia and India with both
inbound and outbound traffic.

The service will be jointly marketed by BT and PanAmSat, who already
market services together with their third partner, Washington
International Teleport, including a 6MBit space segment on PAS-1.

The most likely first clients for the service are MultiChoice, Viacom
(for MTV and other services) and ART for its proposed services to the
region. BT is already transmitting backhaul services to PAS-4 for the
MultiChoice package in South Africa. Seven originate at Madley, where
they are taken from existing satellites, while the remaining seven are
delivered from the BT Tower in central London.

ORBIT BOOKS INTO EUROPE

ORBIT has booked three transponders on Intelsat 702 to allow small-dish
reception of its digital DTH pay-package across western Europe and
North Africa.

Orbit says the new capacity, which will fire up early in 1996, will
enable viewers from London to Algiers to access its channels via 80cm
dishes, giving the same level of service as provided to Middle Eastern
territories via Intelsat 704.

LEBANESE JOIN ARABSAT 2A

FUTURE Vision - the Lebanese broadcaster owned by billionaire prime
minister Rafiq Hariri - as well as Bahrain TV - have each booked a high-
power Ku-Band transponder on Arabsat 2A, the first of the second-
generation Aerospatiale craft scheduled for launch in July 1996.

In the interim, Future is expected to use a transponder on Arabsat 1DR
- two years after the Lebanese channel first went onto satellite, only
to be removed a few weeks later as a result of licensing problems.

Arabsat 2A, to be located at 26 degrees East, and its follow-up, 2B
(destined for 30.5 degrees East after a May 1997 launch) will each
carry 12 Ku-Band and 22 C-Band transponders. With domestic and regional
demand for the satellites building up, Arabsat is conducting a
feasibility study for a third new satellite.

THOMSON ANTI OPEN ACCESS DVB

THOMSON, first-year sole supplier of digital IRDs to DirecTv, sees a
similar pattern of exclusive deals driving the European market.
Delivering this year's Royal Television Society Shoenberg lecture in
London, Thomson research director David Brooks warned would-be digital
broadcasters that manufacturers would not be willing to bear the risks
of launching open-standard DVB boxes into the marketplace.

Exclusive or limited-supplier deals, such as those made by Canal Plus
in France, would be "the only way to ensure a return on investments,"
he said. With a million DSS sales clocked up, a new order for three
million MMDS digital set-tops from the US Tele-TV consortium, plus a
one-year exclusive window for Galaxy Latin America's digital IRDs,
Thomson has got further than most of its rivals.

Brooks believed that set-top-boxes would dominate the digital TV market
for several years, rather than integrated digital TV sets. "It's clear
the set-top-box offers the fastest way into the market," he said.
"Access control is the key issue here - it would be very difficult to
integrate a proprietary system into the TV set, in commercial terms."

Full integration would come, but only after interface requirements had
been fully standardised, and large (40-inch-plus) plasma display
technology had been brought to the market. He felt the DVB-proposed
"PCMCIA-like" common interface was "not the ideal solution,"
particularly in the "hostile environment" of the TV set. An
alternative, he added, could soon be available in the shape of "more
sophisticated smart cards" which would be able to cope with the full
MPEG-2 bitstream.

Terrestrial barely figures in Brooks' forecasts for European DVB market
growth, with satellite dominating for at least the first three years.
Brooks' forecasts (see table) were based on market projections for
France, Germany, UK, Benelux, Scandinavia and Italy.

PACE SCOOPS CHINA SET-TOP DEAL

PACE Micro Technology has won an order to supply three million  set-top
decoders to cable operators in China. The UK manufacturer will be
supplying the units to Guangdong Catv, a provincial cable operator,
over a three-year period.

Located on the Chinese border with Hong Kong, Guangdong Catv negotiated
the deal also on behalf of four other Chinese networks in the 66
million homes region, taking in the six million homes in the capital,
Guangzhou. The first 60,000 units, incorporating News Datacom's
NewsCrypt conditional access, will be delivered by June 1996.
Subsequent production of the units will be carried out by a
Pace/Guangdong joint venture company in China.

According to Pace estimates, China has almost 40 million cable homes
representing penetration of around 13 per cent of total households. The
systems themselves are small, with around 12,000, mainly low-capacity
networks carrying between eight and 20 channels. These typically
include the local terrestrial and government channels, but sometimes as
many as four channels from Star TV. By 2005 as many as 130 million
homes are expected to be connected. This is against the background of a
nationwide satellite dish ban.

BARCO SELLS ROSA TO GUANGDONG

BELGIAN cable equipment manufacturer Barco has sold its Rosa Catv
Management System and the Pulsar TV modulator to China. The products
are destined for the Guangdong Province Catv system. The Rosa system,
which has also been sold to operators in Taiwan and Australia, is set
to be operational across 40 headends in Guangdong Province by the end
of March 1996.

Rosa allows fully automated monitoring and control of headends through
a PC interface and can be operated from thousands of miles away. The
system continuously checks the performance of the headend and in the
event of a fault can switch to back-up modulators based on pre-set
parameters.

Pulsar is a microprocessor controlled TV modulator featuring its own
remote monitoring capabilities and Barco's unique concept of automatic
alignment to catv headends.

According to division manager, broadcast and cable products, Jos
Vancoppernolle, Asia now represents 20 per cent of Barco's business.
There are regular sales of fibre-optic and headend equipment and,
according to Vancoppernolle, plenty of interest in Rosa.

Many Barco products already have the capability to work with Chinese
graphics, and Mandarin software for Rosa is also being introduced.
Vancoppernolle said the investment for this could be recouped in as
little as six months.

DRAKE LAUNCHES GLOBAL IRDS

R L DRAKE has launched its first IRDs, the ESR800 XT and the ESR2000XT
multi-standard, multi-voltage version. Both are engineered to accept a
range of decoder modules including VideoCrypt and D2 Mac Eurocrypt, and
incorporating a card-reader accessed from the front panel. The
ESR2000XT offers Pal/NTSC compatibility, and has dual smart card
readers.

The receiver section offers variable threshold extension to less than
3dB, programmable for customised settings for different regions of the
world. It also allows programmable audio threshold extension, with
Wegener-compatible noise reduction and companding circuitry adjustable
to market conditions.

The ESR800XT has 800 programmable channel memory, each with individual
video/audio and antenna setting, plus 400 favourite channels. Its big
brother offers a useful 2,000 programmable channels, 400 favourites,
and can  track inclined orbit satellites using an optional IOA600
module.

Both models offer six-language on-screen display option, including
Portuguese and Arabic, which as product manager Dan Albrecht notes,
"greatly increases the usability of our products in many regions of the
world."

ECHOSTAR DIGITAL BOX UNVEILED

WITH the launch of the Echostar 1 satellite from the Chinese Long March
rocket due on December 28, the US company displayed its first digital
satellite receiver at Hong Kong's Cable & Satellite Asia show in
December.

The MPEG-2-compatible receiver includes conditional access provided by
Nagra Plus of Switzerland. Digital encoding is supplied by Divicom.
Programme choice is made through a sophisticated EPG. "We've tried to
make it as simple as possible, some other brands make it quite
difficult to get from their menu back into the programming, you've got
to go through a lot of gyrations. We do it in one button," says
Echostar's Peter Knowles.

The utilities menu includes an aid to align the dish towards the
correct satellite. If the subscriber enters his zip code then the
receiver will automatically display the correct azimuth and elevation
angles for anywhere within the US. There is also a field strength
indicator, changing colour to green when the Echostar satellite is
found. Diagnostic features help installers talk through problems on the
telephone without the need to make house calls. Smart cards and phone
links through the RGA14 point can be checked.

Echostar's DBS system will offer over 100 channels of digital video and
250 channels of audio, transmitting across the US to 18-inch dishes.

S-A EXPANDS 8600 SET-TOP FACILITIES

SCIENTIFIC Atlanta is upping the bandwidth on its 8600 set-top box. A
new 750MHz version will be made available to the Asian market next year
having already been successfully deployed in the US where it is used by
the top 10 MSOs where 700,000 units have so far been shipped, says S-A.

Marketing manager, subscriber products international division broadband
communications, Vibha Rustagi said that operators would typically
purchase both the 550MHz and 750MHz versions. The 750MHz versions would
only then be deployed in homes which had subscribed to premium
channels, saving network operators a possible $15 (#10). Bandwidth of
550MHz can normally carry up to 60 channels.

The 8600 series features an on-screen display capable of individual
messaging either to individuals or to groups of subscribers. Pay-per-
view ordering can be made through impulse on the RF.

A key part of the 8600 is the electronic programme guide. Following the
familiar pattern of EPGs, subscribers can look up shows in the schedule
requesting greater detail on their desired programme choice. Through
'virtual channels' an operator can add additional sections of data,
perhaps with backing from a sponsor, which do not take up the full
amount of bandwidth required by a broadcast network, thus adding to the
customer's perceived value.

A built in set-top diagnostic enables the subscriber to quote a
reference number back to the service engineer, saving a house call if
the problem can be solved from the headend.

SATELLITE READY REVISITED

MITSUBISHI has joined the select band of manufacturers offering Nicam
and Dolby TV sets with on-board satellite receivers - recognising that
in the UK at least, Sky Television remains the chief source of surround
sound transmissions.

The Japanese manufacturer's latest AV18B and AV18BDS series offers 59cm
and 66cm models, in either Nicam or full Dolby Pro Logic versions, each
complete with integrated 150-channel satellite receiver/VideoCrypt
decoder.

The satellite section is pre-tuned to all current Astra (1A to 1D) TV
and radio channels, with dedicated Scart for simultaneous recording.
The sets offer many other advanced features, - including NTSC and Secam
playback capability.

Interestingly the satellite-equipped models retail at just #50 more
than the terrestrial-only versions, with the top model to sell at
#899.99.

HIGH-END CHAPARRAL

US receiver maker Chaparral has never been one to shy away from the
high end of the market. On a visit to its 'Euro-bunker,' Julian Clover
finds out why

Craig Howard is a long way from home. On this occasion, the US receiver
and LNB manufacturer's representative in Europe is in Heerhugowaard, a
suburb of Amsterdam, and nominally Chaparral's European headquarters.

Before arriving in Europe, the company had considered London as a
possible base, but with its Dutch distributor, The Satellite Shop,
already making a major contribution to the business, coupled with
favourable local regulations for the incorporation of foreign
companies, the Dutch capital became the preferred option.

The Satellite Shop is a major element in the Dutch DTH business. From
its base in Heerhugowaard, TSS has developed from being a dealer to
distributor and is now even getting into the manufacturing business.
Its newest product is a low-cost mount, which allows the tracking of
inclined orbit satellites, preferably as an accompaniment to
Chaparral's high-end receivers for the motorised market.

"We knew that we wanted to get a base in Europe, but we just didn't
know where to commit," explains Howard. "The Satellite Shop has always
housed our Info Centre and we've done a lot of testing here in the past
of alpha products. We decided early in 1994 that if we were going to
base somewhere this should be it."

Chaparral's first reconnaissance trip to Europe was nine years ago when
Dave Thomas was despatched from the company's base in San Jose to find
distributors for its product. "They were essentially just dealers,
hobbyists who were fascinated with the technology," says Howard. "Some
of them have developed into people like Rens Maas or Steve Chilver, who
became people who were significant in their respective markets."

Chaparral Europe is, in fact, something of a misnomer; Howard - whose
father Taylor is chairman of the board of the SBCA, America's satellite
trade association - spends at least half of his time outside of the
Netherlands. "There was a really long debate in the company as to
whether I was going to be based in Dubai after Spain, because we had so
much going on there. But, we've spent a long time developing
partnerships in the key Middle East markets, and they're working out
very well. We're comfortable that we've covered there," he says.

In addition to the US and Europe, Chaparral boasts offices in Beijing
and Jakarta. The company also a presence in South America, though not
an office.

Feeds and LNBs remain, according to Howard, Chaparral's lifeblood.
"It's interesting because in the US we're so well known for our feeds
and LNBs and in so many other markets it's receivers - that's what
we're famous for in Europe. We sell a lot more feed and LNB products in
Europe than we do receivers dollarwise, but we hold that high-end niche
which most people have left alone."

In the US, Chaparral has pulled out of the receiver business - the
result of the market's recent shift away from 'backyard' C-Band to
digital DBS. In addition, the cost of Japanese-manufactured equipment
has fallen as the dollar continues to take a pounding from the Yen.
However, receivers for the US business and educational sector, where
Chaparral is the market-leader, remain in production.

"Internationally, our receivers are still quite strong and there are
three models we manufacture for markets specifically other than the
US," says Howard. The Monterey 140 and MC115 are set to be joined by a
new product, the 200C, for educational and overseas distance-learning
markets. The new product has more extensive control via telephone lines
and PC links.

In Europe, the company hasn't been afraid to mix and match its products
to suit its target markets. In the UK, for instance, not only has
Chaparral elected to stay out of the low-end receiver business, but it
has taken a unique approach to the high-end niche. "The UK market
nearly demands that you have VideoCrypt built-in, or the ability to add
it later on. Steve Chilver Trading - our exclusive full-line
distributor in the UK - is a value-added reseller and they make some
specific models for the market, like the rebranded Highway version."

But as always with bespoke tailoring, it doesn't come cheap. The
Monterey 140, which retails for #1,500 without a decoder goes up in
price by another #1,000 by the time either D2 Mac or VideoCrypt
decoders are added.

With digital on the horizon and most new non-Astra channels taking the
MPEG route, won't demand for motorised systems simply dry up? "People
who have exposure to satellite currently have a better taste for it.
People that go digital immediately are not going to know any better,"
replies Howard. Chaparral's receivers too are future-proof, or at least
compatible with digital decoders, unlike those of its competitors.

"Satellite receivers became such a competitive business that most
people looked at the circuitry and said why bother in a market for that
is going to be relatively slim," says Howard. He believes that southern
Africa, among other emerging markets, will eventually see combined
analogue and digital receivers - a product which will prove expensive,
but for which there will probably be great demand.

RAINBOW WARRIORS

South Africa may have the first MPEG-2 DSTV service, but it seems the
Rainbow Nation will demand a wider variety of services. Nick Snow
reports from Satsem '95

If ever a land was made for direct-to-home satellite television
services it was South Africa, where the 'Rainbow Nation' is spread
across distances that defy the European imagination. In 1973 the South
African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) said "DBS is the obvious
route... but economic factors are a problem."

The quotation could happily have run 22 years later as the headline for
Satsem '95 in November, the second annual gathering at Johannesburg's
World Trade Centre organised by SCASA (Satellite Communications
Association of South Africa) for the growing DTH industry.

The industry conference allied to a small exhibition brought together
the main players from broadcasters to installers, and brought out the
main issues confronting this potentially huge market.

From a scratch start South Africa recently became the world's first
digital satellite broadcasting nation with full DVB MPEG-2
compatibility following the launch of MultiChoice DSTV off of PAS-4.
MultiChoice is, of course, part of the Nethold sphere of pay-television
companies which, among others, includes South Africa's long-established
terrestrial pay-TV broadcaster M-Net, encryption services provider
Irdeto and signal distribution offshoot Orbicom. It is hard to
overestimate the group's dominance in this its home market, and the
lack of current competition was high on the agenda of this gathering of
independent-minded distributors, dealers and installers.

In theory, there was good news for them. Gert Claassen, CEO of SABC,
arrived to announce it was pressing ahead with plans to launch (at
least) five analogue free-to-air channels on PAS-4 and Intelsat 704,
and by summer 1996 eight digital subscription channels building to 21
channels by July 1998.

Failing to arrive were the team from Africa Satellite Entertainment
Corporation (ASEC), which has transponder rights on Intelsat 704 and
whose test-card was still promising a launch of services in the last
week of November.

Suddenly, South Africa was to be awash with signals both digital and
analogue, although apart from MultiChoice's supermarket shelf of the
leading channel brands from Europe and the US, and SABC's rebroadcast
of national and regional channels, there was little clue what would be
on them. And would it matter anyway? Availability of receivers - in
particular the DSTV receivers of exclusive licensees Pace and Panasonic
- was a dominant theme. At least four of five receivers were at the
show and after some cajoling several of them worked. Estimates of how
many would be available by Christmas '95 ranged from virtually nil to
50,000.

An inauspicious start it might seem - although dire warnings about the
perils of regular complete signal loss for viewers in South Africa's
hostile climate (the idea of a small problem with a digital signal is
apparently in the same category of wishful thinking as being a little
bit pregnant), lead some to imply installers would be better off
starved of supply until they'd had some practice. Needless to say, the
installers didn't see it that way.

MultiChoice, though, remains relaxed. And why not? Its service is very
expensive (possibly over #50 a month for the full package and up to
#500 for the receiver) but it hits breakeven at not much over 200,000
subs or 10 per cent of the target affluent white market. And in a
country where most urban white homes sport notices pronouncing armed
response alarms, it isn't difficult to see them paying up for more in-
home entertainment.

Meantime, there remains a vast if less affluent market to be served and
the ANC government is anxious it should be recognising broadcasting as
a potentially benevolent binding element for the Rainbow Nation.

It seems certain that either through the SABC (whose future is in doubt
but some form of privatisation seems the most likely option), or more
likely a commercial joint venture with MultiChoice, a range of analogue
services can and will co-exist alongside DSTV.

If, however, everyone pursues the digital dream too soon, many felt
South Africa could have the unwelcome distinction of being the first
market outside the US into the digital market and the first to be
forced to abandon it.

QUALITY TIME

Gate numbers weren't, perhaps, all they might have been at Hong Kong's
Cable and Satellite Asia exhibition, allowing vendors to spend a little
'quality time' with their potential customers

Along the growth curve of satellite exhibitions Cable & Satellite Asia
is, like the market it serves, still in its genesis. However, Year Two
of the show, which took place at Hong Kong's Convention and Exhibition
Centre (December 6-8), proved that the Singapore office of Reed
Exhibition Companies is making steady progress in its development. 120
international exhibitors were present, between them boasting as many as
90 new products. Visitor numbers nudging just 2,000 were approximately
a third down on a year ago, which was attributed by some to MipAsia
taking place the week before and not simultaneously, as it did in 1994.

Nevertheless, Cable & Satellite Asia '95 witnessed a 20 per cent growth
in size and the organiser is banking on further 30 per cent growth for
this year's event, which again takes place in Hong Kong November 20-22.
And according to Jimmy Lau, regional vice president, Reed Exhibition
Companies, the amount of floorspace booked for 1997 is double again.

"This year we have seen an even higher number of overseas visitors,
people who actually make plans to come in and visit the show," says
Lau. "From my conversations with the exhibitors, they've maybe come
across only one dissatisfied customer, the rest are making good
contacts."

One problem which seems to afflict Cable and Satellite Asia, as it does
with the sister show in London, is a shortage of cable operators.
Though some were present, particularly at the conference, Lau has some
ideas up his sleeve to boost their attendance in future years.

Yet, there was certainly no lack of exhibitors targeting the cable
sector; among others, the mighty Americans

General Instrument and Scientific Atlanta were present, as were Euro
suppliers Barco and Sagem. The latter proving that there is a market
for D2 Mac, even in Asia.

Barco of Belgium, took the opportunity to launch its Pulsar remote-
monitoring TV modulator into the Asian market. The company, which
counts Hong Kong among almost 30 offices, announced that it had already
sold both Pulsar and Rosa catv management system to the Guangdong
Province Catv System. Guangdong, in fact, was on everybody's lips,
especially because of Pace's announcement that it was supplying the
region with three million cable set-tops. Guangdong, located on China's
border with Hong Kong, also acquired hardware on behalf of other
provinces within the PRC. The first 60,000 Pace units are slated for
delivery in June.

Pace shared its stand with the BBC, apparently to promote a common
terrestrial/satellite digital platform, an ambition which extends
beyond the confines of their domestic, UK markets. Though according to
John Sykes, head of BBC Resource's transmission section, development
plans have stalled slightly of late because of the debate over QAM
variants. With NTL having proposed 2QAM for the UK and most of the rest
of Europe pushing for 8QAM, Pace, he suggested, would probably take the
commercial decision to include both in its box.

Though attendees came from right across the region, including the
Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand, Lau says he wants to build
up the numbers coming from Taiwan and India, which he says are still
strangers to the show. "There are more people coming who are more
interested in hardware than programming, but I think this will increase
as we continue our association with Casbaa," he says.

The involvement of Casbaa (the Cable and Satellite Broadcasting
Association) - itself a growing industry force in the region - produced
a conference line-up which read like a who's who in the industry in the
Asia region. Bill Hooks, (outgoing) president HBO Asia, Gary Davey,
Star TV's managing director and Casbaa and Turner's Far East president,
Ted McFarland, made for a formidable line-up. Lau though suggests that
McFarland's boss, Ted Turner (or is it now Gerry Levine) might even be
tempted to appear at a future conference.

Programmers were few and far between on the exhibit floor, but not
entirely absent. ESPN and CNBC were both present, as was Turner
International. However, Star was there only in the guise of its
hardware arm, Starnet, and satellite operators were also conspicuous by
their absence in the exhibition hall.

The next Cable and Satellite Asia will run parallel to Reed's
Intermedia show, which has been a successful exhibition in its own
right in both the US and Singapore. Lau's aim is for synergies between
multimedia companies and cablecos, already flowering in the US, to also
be cultivated in the Asia Pacific markets.

CABLE AND SATELLITE EUROPE via NewsNet

TRANSPONDER WATCH

45W: PAS-1

PAS-3R is due to fly with an Ariane 4 launch vehicle to 43 degrees
West, joining this satellite which launched in June 1988. The original
PAS-3 met a watery grave a year ago. The new satellite is an HS601
satellite with 16 C-Band and 16 Ku-Band transponders, and will be used
for television programme distribution on both sides of the Atlantic and
in North and South America and Africa. NHK feeds are now at 68.5
degrees East at 12GHz.

37.5W: Orion 1

NTL has a five-year contract with Orion for distribution to cable
headends. London's Channel One will be uplinked from London in digital
MPEG-2, DVB-compliant System 3000 for around 40 cable systems, each
with a top-specification 2.4-metre dish. Most signals on this satellite
are actually acceptable on dishes half that size. The Yugoslavian peace
deals prompted the return of TV from Pale on 12586MHz vertical and a
newcomer is South Korean KDBS, every night at around 19.00-20.00GMT in
Pal on 12654MHz vertical, Tp.3 with a good signal originating in
Germany. Hindi-Urdu channel Asianet is on 11585MHz horizontal from New
Jersey, USA and is probably the best of the bunch, especially as it
remains, for the time being, in-the-clear. Plenty of feeds have been
noted on 11539MHz vertical.

l 27.5W: Intelsat 601

BBC Prime slogs away in D2 Mac on Tp.71 vertical along with fellow UK
Travel channel in Tp. 63B, while on the opposite polarity CMT Europe
feeds into Europe from the US 24- hours-a-day, but at a signal strength
that makes smaller dish reception difficult. SIS has long used a
transponder on this satellite to feed UK betting shops and is on
11591MHz horizontal, hence the 1.2-metre fixed polarity and position
dishes close to many UK betting establishments. The other B Mac signal,
a system that remains unhacked, is UK cable channel SelecTV, sharing
the lower part of Travel's transponder. FilmNet has a digital multiplex
on this satellite and some UK cable-only channels use the MPEG-2
compression system here too.

29.4W: Intelsat 504

Intelsat 504 was removed from geostationary orbit in mid-November. It
was launched in 1982 serving the Atlantic Ocean Region. The oldest
Intelsat - 501 - is still in service.

21.5W: Intelsat K & 512

US wrestling for Sky One continues to be fed over this craft at
11532MHz vertical in NTSC. Feeds for the Mir-Atlantis space expedition
were seen on 11499MHz horizontal and 11533MHz vertical. New Intelsats
due above the Euro horizon this year are 708, at 50 degrees West, 709,
at 56 degrees West and 803 at 64 degrees East. It is at the end of this
year that two degrees spacing around 60-66 degrees East is implemented.

19W: TDF1/2

There are three active transponders. Canal Plus on Tp.5 1804MHz, Cine
Cinemas on Tp.9 11881MHz and Canal France International on 12034MHz,
all in D2 Mac. Generally, the situation now is that there are only
seven high-power DBS satellites active in European skies which carry
less than 10 unencrypted TV channels. Apart from second-hand value for
broadcasts to Scandinavia, the European DBS satellites each with five
high-power 100 watt transponders have proved to be the wrong platform
for the wrong job.

14W: Ekspress 2

The Ekspress satellite has four more transponders than the preceding
Gorizont class; 10 C-Band and two Ku-Band transponders are available.
An adaptable mixture of cross-strapping and six antennas allows more
flexibility than before. This satellite has maintained station-keeping
better than any other Russian satellite to date, apart from the Gals
DBS craft. TV use is confined to C-Band and amounts to six channels;
Apna, Muslim, RTPi, Cuba, TV3 Russia and ORT Russia, sharing four
transponders.

5W: Telecom 2A

Tucked away on teletext was a short but notable announcement that TF1
and France Television (operators of France 2 and 3) are to join forces
to investigate digital pay-TV services via Eutelsat. France Telecom
would appear to have under-estimated the in-orbit capacity required for
TV services.

3E: Telecom 1C

After Flight 80's success at delivering a space-telescope, Ariane
Flight 81 returned to the serious business of satellite TV and took
Telecom 2C and Insat 2C into orbit. Bayern 3 broadcast the launch live
on Astra, as it has most recent Ariane launches. Insat 2C is the first
of the Insat 2 series to be for telecommunications-only; there is no
meteorology equipment on-board. In place of that payload there are two
Ku-Band transponders. Insat 2C will be located at 93.5 degrees East.
The French satellite will replace Telecom 1C this month and bring much-
needed second-generation Ku-capacity to the French Telecom portfolio.
The new satellite has C-Band and 12GHz capacity in horizontal as well
as the Telecom 1 series vertical polarisation. Feeds of the US
President's visit to Ireland for BBC News were noted on 12648MHz
vertical. Also, inserts for the terrestrial channel TV de Catalunya
appeared. Play from the ATP-Championship-tour in Germany destined for
Sky was seen in-the-clear on 12606MHz vertical.

5E Tele-X & Sirius

Swedish channel SVT 2 has switched to digital format on 12422MHz.

13E: Eutelsat II F1 & Hot Bird 1

La Cinquieme has joined Arte on Tp.26 11080MHz vertical. It shows an
educational mix of programmes each daytime. RTL-2 has been joined by a
Jazz sound sub-carrier of unknown origin on 8.10MHz, 11096MHz
horizontal, but probably a filler from RFE. Italian TV channels Rai Uno
and Rai Due moved here from 10 degrees East last year. The last
international TV service from Italy was Raisat on the Olympus satellite
at 19 degrees West, which died in August 1993. Rai is to join the
international TV league this year when a satellite-delivered service to
the Americas and Australia is anticipated. VOA Europe, a music and
speech mix reflecting the American way of life, has been taken by cable
and a few terrestrial stations over the years. At present it uses
Deutsche Welle TV sub-carriers but US government cuts are forcing the
station to find private financing. However it has been granted a
reprieve until March, when it might have to leave the air. In Europe,
CNN and NBC do such do good job in the private sector, that VOA and
radio's days must be numbered. Latest VOA convert is Melody 91.5 FM
heard on a recent visit to Beirut. The 36MHz, six-channel Viacom
digital multiplex signal on this satellite includes an MTV feed, MTV
Italian and German streams, Sci-Fi Channel and Bloomberg TV, a version
of the already successful US financial service on PAS-2. The analogue
VH-1 Germany signal on 11238MHz horizontal has ceased and dual-
illuminates the digital multiplex. Tp.40 12521MHz on this satellite has
been taken by AB-1 Channel, a French family entertainment network in
analogue Pal, for cable networks. Tp.41 is used by both WTN and APTV
for digital feeds from the Gray's Inn Road Teleport in London. XXX-TV,
or TV Erotica, on 11534MHz in D2 Mac, has been deemed too hot for
Britain, if not for Hot Bird 1, and has been given the same treatment
meted out to Red Hot Television. The UK Heritage minister has issued an
order outlawing the supply of smart cards, programmes and advertising
related to the channel. At least two more adult channels are due on-air
this year, Babylon Blue and Adam and Eve, the latter with no link to
the US channel of the same name. The Rabin funeral last year was the
cause of largest bookings of space segment yet, according to Maxat.
Also using the resources of adaptable Maxat; Herbalife TV has been seen
on this satellite at 12586MHz vertical. Longer term, Eutelsat has
agreed the launch next year, of three satellites with Arianespace. They
are Hot Bird 4 and two other (W24) satellites at other locations.

16E: Eutelsat II F3

The most obvious change on this satellite is the colourful Thaiwave,
from Thailand each evening around 18.00-20.00GMT. In a welcome addition
to satellite TV, the tests are seen every evening on Tp.22, 11163MHz
horizontal with audio at 6.6MHz. Scrambling of the signal will follow
and the fee will be DM56 each month. Egyptian TV is to add another
relay of its international service this year. Besides the relay on this
satellite, Arabsat C-Band at 31 degrees East and 1 degree West
Intelsat, a new relay to the Americas starts in May via the Alphastar
DBS satellite, or AT&T's Telstar 402R as it correctly known. It is
owned by Canadian-based Tee-Comm, and a medium-power, 100-channel
service to the US will start early this year to 60cm dishes from 89
degrees West. ATN, Asian Television Network will also join them.
Radiotelevisao Portuguesa Internaaional, which reaches most corners of
this small globe, has never been easy to find programme details for. An
Internet web though has just opened to provide those missing facts. The
channel will probably be available live via the same route within a
couple of years. TV Roumania International and for a while Actualitati
Radio, the channels that sadly could not bring you President
Ceausescu's Christmas message in 1989, seem to be fully operational
from the new Bucharest Scientific Atlanta uplink to Tp.37, 11575MHz
vertical 19.30-23.00GMT daily. An indication of the true pace of change
there is the recent ban on the cable TV relay of Duna TV from Hungary
in nearby Timisoara. TVRi was formed as many eastern European nations
have been starting satellite TV services for expatriates or foreign
audiences. The abandoned Polsat slot at 11638MHz horizontal was
occupied by Apna TV, the Hindi channel also at 11 degrees West Ku-Band,
but has now ceased.

19.2E: Astra 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D & 1E

The end of next month sees CNBC launch more fully on Astra with Asian,
live US and four hours of The European Money Wheel programme. Astra 1E
is invisible to most fixed-dish owners due the frequency band used. The
satellite tested at around 14.7 degrees East and had been moved into
position by the first week of December, after blank carrier tests but
no analogue pictures were seen. As production rates and costs will be a
factor in the take-up of DVB digital TV, the news of a new single chip
receiver, the LS64704, from LSI Logic Corp, is a welcome development.
Early users will be ZDF and ARD, which start parallel transmissions of
their analogue Pal signals soon. America One is the new audio service
on VH-1 Tp.22 at 11538MHz, 7.74MHz. Live speech programming is provided
by National Public radio in Washington and Public Radio International
of Minneapolis. The service was due to start January 1 and is provided
by successful radio-relay agent WRN, World Radio Network, which now
runs four different programmes on various satellites. The operating
frequencies at this location are now 10700-12100MHz. There are various
ways of achieving such reception, but the new Universal LNBs are
probably the most cost-efficient and flexible units yet produced for
the European market. The lack of digital signals and suitable receivers
effectively rules out the need for DBS band reception, at least at
presently. No serious BSkyB digital involvement is expected until 1997.
As we enter this New Year, the channels now at this location look quite
varied. There are two clear news channels, Sky News and CNN, as well as
portions of NBC/CNBC. There are also two clear sports channels, multi-
lingual Eurosport and German DSF. TNT is the only clear English/French
film channel, sharing time with Cartoon Network. Arte is a clear
cultural German/French channel with some original-language programming.
It is a rather long list, but in addition to the above there are the
clear German broadcasters, both public and private, four channels for
the Dutch market and some offerings from further afield; Japan's NHK
through JSTV, Mexico's Galavision, Hindi Zee TV and two Chinese
channels. Three versions of TV3 for Denmark, Norway and Sweden,
accounting for three transponders, looks wasteful though, while Spanish
thematic channels absorb another three. QVC's home shopping service is
the only free access VideoCrypt signal in Europe, and the remaining
signals on the satellites are either German or UK-based scrambled
channels, mainly with Videocrypt scrambling, though some run dual VC2
codes. Also, 58 different radio programmes in an assortment of
languages are transmitted on FM audio sub-carriers.

20E: Telstar 301/

Arabsat 1DR

If it was not for the cooling effect of winter temperatures on our LNB
unit, we would have lost the signals from the Orbit barker channel plus
Syrian, Sudanese and the four ART channels on this satellite. All
signals are in the 3740-4060MHz range, are horizontal and, thus, limp
into Europe.

28.5E: DFS Kopernikus 2 Flight 2

VT4 for the Flemish audience uses digital capacity played out from the
Maxat teleport at Brookmans Park, using the Tandberg, Sagem and Divicom
system on 12544MHz vertical. Other occupants are the Hungarian
scrambled music channel Top-TV and Czech channels Premiera and Cable
Plus. The satellite is also used for video feeds within Germany and
beyond.

42E: Turksat 1B

Look out for Bosnian TV from Sarajevo - the logo is BIH. The signal may
appear here or on a Eutelsat, although reports of it being ready for
the New Year proved over-optimistic. Kanal 6 and Interstar both
suffered programme suspension at the end of last year, puzzling many
viewers. The Turkish state regulator had upheld complaints against the
channels over political, sexual and economic allegations made on news
and current affairs programmes.

68.5E: PAS-4

Doordarshan TV International (DDI) is on this satellite on C-Band at
Tp.12C 4040MHz horizontal with programming from 03.30 to 0630GMT in
Hindi and English. It brought news of the official opening of DD3, a
new domestic Indian TV broadcaster. All other TV direct from Indian is
on satellites beyond the Euro-arc, including NEPC (the exception,
spotted this month on 66 degrees East), another new Indian channel
which has taken to air with Hindi family programmes. BT at Martlesham
in Suffolk has installed a new dish to access this satellite and is
already supplying programmes into the South African market. The look-
angle to this satellite is low, hence the easterly location.

71E: Gals 1

Gals 2 was launched by a Proton-K rocket on November 17 and has the
same three wide Ku-Band transponders as Gals-1. The orbital destination
is still far from clear but it was at 87.5 degrees East when last
spotted and  drifting at a daily rate of one degree West. A clutch of
reports have the satellite variously leased to Chinese Land Group.
Shareholders include the Loral Corp, General Instrument  and TCI Cable
TV Co, British General Telecommunications Ltd and Asian TV network, a
South African concern and Russian State broadcasting. They all talk
about a co-location here or further over at 31 degrees East. The Gals-1
craft spent some time at 44 degrees East with Russian TV relays in the
12GHz band. The South African IBA has even approved initial consent for
a space TV service from Gals, but a location at the hot South African
51dBW slot at 66 degrees East and PAS-4 at 68.5 degrees East would seem
more logical.

80E: Gorizont 24

Be thankful this satellite is a difficult one to catch; the former
Kazakh TV occupant has been criticised for televising executions. More
acceptable behaviour is seen on HTB (NTV), as seen at 11575MHz vertical
on 16 degrees, East and also from TV6 Moscow.

100.5E: Asiasat 2

A Long March 2F rocket took Asiasat 2 aloft from Xichang in Sichuan at
the end of last year. The Lockheed Martin series 7000 satellite is
equipped with 24 C-Band and nine Ku-Band transponders. Known bookings
are for Deutsche Welle, RTP Portugal, APTV and Star TV, as well as
China, Vsat systems and other telecommunications projects. Star TV
plans expansion, despite continuing financial losses ascribe by
management to it still being in "investment mode." Those plans include
better targeting of specific countries instead of pan-Asian services.
China Central TV has started to test digital TV services; a film
channel, sports, entertainment and a clear youth/science/military or
'variety channel,' will use capacity here or on Chinasat 5 at 115.5
degrees East. It is notable that the Chinese Public TV station did not
show the Asiasat 2 launch live, in case of public humiliation in a
repeat of the disaster a year ago. Echostar 1, a US DBS satellite bound
for 101 degrees West, is the next Chinese launch and aims to rival the
already established DirecTv.

116 E: Mugunghwa 2

The launch of Koreasat 2, also known as Mugunghwa 2, should have taken
place around New Year. To attend to the problems which shortened the
life of the first satellite, McDonnell-Douglas worked on the Delta 2
rocket's pressure and temperature systems and then successfully used
the same type of vehicle to launch a Canadian Radarsat from California
in November. This year will see the success or failure of the new
Ariane 5, the Russian Proton and the Chinese Long March launchers.

CLT CONFIRMS INTENTION TO JOIN CANALSATELLITE

Canal Plus' digital DTH company Canalsatellite is being valued in
preparation for the entry of la Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de
Telediffusion (CLT) as a shareholder (C&SE Vol.12 No.24). "We are
currently in negotiation with Canal Plus about joining the capital of
Canalsatellite," confirmed Geneviave Yver, senior manager at CLT's
digital arm, Club RTL. "However the value of Canalsatellite has to be
first established, as we do not think it is worth the amount cited by
Canal Plus, of around Fr4 billion (#526m)."

According to Patrick Jousseaume, media analyst at stockbroker Ferri,
Canalsatellite was valued at Fr1 billion when it launched as an
analogue service in November 1992 and should now be worth Fr2-3
billion. If CLT were to take a 25% stake, as has been suggested, it
would correspond to between Fr500 and Fr750 million. Canalsatellite's
ownership would then stand as follows: Canal Plus (52.5%); CLT (25%);
Compagnie Generale des Eaux (15%); Chargeurs (7.5%). Canalsatellite is
currently owned by Canal Plus (70%), CGE (20%) and Chargeurs (10%).

Several factors have pushed CLT to change its strategy. First, the
investment needed to launch its own French-speaking digital bouquet of
25 thematic channels was estimated at around Fr5 billion compared with
Fr400 million invested by Canal Plus in Canalsatellite. CLT has not
halted its own digital plans so far, revealed Yver. "Until a final
agreement on CLT joining Canalsatellite is reached, we will continue
working on our own bouquet. We intend to be an active partner in
Canalsatellite and bring our knowledge in marketing and programmes."

For the deal to go-ahead, all shareholders (Canal Plus, CGE, Chargeurs,
CLT) have to agree, said a source at Canal Plus. An agreement before
the launch of Canalsatellite planned at the end of the first quarter of
1996 is preferred, but the shareholders do not outrule the discussions
continuing.

For Havas, the common shareholder in CLT and Canal Plus,  CLT joining
Canalsatellite would resolve Havas' concern over the two companies
launching two competing bouquets. Anne Brucy, Havas senior manager,
said, "We are glad that things are developing as they are. We always
expected that only one bouquet would be launched."

CLT also faces difficulties on the German market where a recent article
in German magazine Der Spiegel claimed that Bertelsmann was close to a
take- over of CLT.

The German story was flatly denied the next day (December 27) by the
Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Junker, however, who claimed he
had "the personal assurance" from CLT's Belgian shareholder Albert
Frare that he was not to sell his stake in the company.

Junker did confirm that CLT is negotiating taking a 25% stake in Canal
Plus digital bouquet Canalsatellite. CLT has long been battling with co-
shareholder Bertelsmann over control of German TV station RTL.
Bertelsmann which controls 48.1% of the capital wants to buy out the 2%
owned by Burda to reach 50.1% of RTL capital.

This delicate position of the CLT in France and in Germany goes some
way towards justifying the rumours about the sale of CLT to a
conglomerate composed of Bertelsmann/Canal Plus/Havas.

Industry observers suggest CLT may now take the option of opening up
its capital (Fr16 billion or #2bn) - to foreign partners like Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp, Disney, Viacom or Time Warner, to ward off
Bertelsmann and Canal Plus.

UK GOLD, VIDEOTRON CLASH OVER PACKAGING

Failed year-long negotiations have resulted in UK Gold instructing
Videotron to stop distributing the channel to its London and Hampshire
franchises from February 12, a move described by Benjamin Ball, head of
programming at Videotron, as "a strong-arm negotiating tactic."

The crux is Videotron's refusal to carry UK Gold on its lowest
retention tier of five channels called Option 1, (to which channels can
be added a la carte). Gold is carried in a 10-channel tier called
Standard Pack - Videotron's 'big basic' is called Super Pack.

Videotron claims that UK Gold is asking for #0.10 per subscriber more
than any other cable operator because it wants flexibility of
packaging, and is bundling UK Gold with UK Living, making it uneconomic
to carry UK Gold alone.

Bruce Steinberg, chief executive of UK Gold, told C&SE, "It's nothing
to do with UK Living. We offer them the same single channel deal as to
the rest of the industry. We believe that UK Gold should go to the most
widely distributed package, not in the second tier. Videotron
distributes UK Gold as an o la carte channel against our wishes. We
have offered deals on lower than 95% penetration, but there's a price.
They can keep their tiered structure and even a la carte, but they will
have to pay a tiered price. We are buying top quality content and it's
expensive. We need realistic penetration rates to sell. We won't
jeopardise 98% of our business for 2%, giving preferential terms."

UK Gold is received by 87% of Videotron subscribers, the remainder
could do so for #1 as an a la carte channel, or #3 pcm for the next
tier. Unconfirmed industry estimates put the current price per
subscriber for UK Gold at around #0.28 and #0.38, with current
invoicing to Videotron around #0.45.

Videotron says it is resisting attempts by UK Gold to impose
contractual conditions that do not give its customers a flexible low-
cost cable TV service. Steinberg countered, "Videotron goes on about
how much better its packaging is, but its penetration levels are the
same as the rest of the industry - 21%. As Option 1 only has a couple
of channels, the terrestrial channels and their interactive services,
their penetration rate is actually a lot lower. Let them make their
interactive services a la carte."

Videotron responds that it has one of the lowest churn rates in the
industry and is building penetration by removing the financial barrier
to entry. Videotron intends to continue negotiations with UK Gold,
which is also hopeful the dispute will be resolved.

ASTRA 1E BEGINS DIGITAL BROADCAST

The first digital services have been switched on to the newly-
commissioned Astra 1E. However, the lack of available receivers means
that the services are only being viewed by a select few.

The first two channels to be switched on were the German national
public broadcasters ARD and ZDF (Transponder 71). Since December 31 the
clear MPEG-2 transmissions have been broadcast direct from SES in
Luxembourg after being converted from the analogue format.

The French Canalsatellite package is using transponders 66 and 70; the
transmissions had previously been made from Astra 1D, which also
operates in the Astra 1E band. The number of channels included in the
multiplex package continues to vary.

Nethold is using transponders 77 and 80 for its test transmissions from
its digital centre in Hilversum. Again, the number of programmes
included is regularly varied, but will include channels in
MultiChoice's Scandinavian package.

MultiChoice premium channel FilmNet was rebranded from January 1. Astra
channel FilmNet Plus became FilmNet 1 while the Thor-delivered FilmNet:
The Complete Movie Channel is now titled FilmNet 2.

REWE BUYS INTO PRO 7

Germany's largest food retailing group Rewe entered the media business
last week with the purchase of a 40% stake in commercial TV station Pro
7, set up by Thomas Kirch and Pro 7 chairman Georg Kopfler in 1989.
Rewe is thought to have paid around DM60 million (#27m) for the shares,
which it bought off the two Munich banks BFH Bank and Bayerische
Hypotheken (which held 75% of the shares). The two banks are now left
with a 35.5% share in Pro 7, while Kirch still holds 24.5%.

ORBIT INTO EUROPE

Orbit has booked three transponders on Intelsat 702 to allow small-dish
reception of its digital DTH pay-package across western Europe and
North Africa. The new capacity, which will fire up early in 1996, will
enable viewers from London to Algiers to access its channels via 80cm
dishes, giving the same level of service as provided to Middle Eastern
territories via Intelsat 704.

The three transponders will enable Orbit to offer its full 30-plus TV
and radio channels, though in Europe access is likely to be restricted
to those (chiefly Arabic-language) channels for which Orbit holds
rights outside the Middle East region.

AFCO BACKS ARABS

For the first time, the French cable operators' association AFCO has
demanded the authorisation to carry North African channels (C&SE Vol.12
No.23). Until now, this kind of demand has been made by individual
operators and didn't succeed. Under the umbrella of AFCO, the cable
operators now stand more chance of success. During the December meeting
in Cotonou (Benin, Africa), the head of French regulatory body, CSA,
Herve Bourges, asked the French president of the Republic, Jacques
Chirac, to allow the CSA to sign agreements with Arabic channels. AFCO
argues that cable should receive the same treatment as satellite which
is allowed to broadcast Arabic-speaking channels without regulation.

KIRCH REACHES COMPROMISE WITH MMBG

Seemingly defeated in the digital decoder war in Germany, Leo Kirch has
swallowed his pride and signed up to the Multi-media
Betriebsgesellschaft, the consortium of Deutsche Telekom, Canal Plus,
CLT, German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF and private broadcaster RTL
set up to develop an open, unified decoder system for Germany. Seca
(the joint company formed by Bertelsmann and Canal Plus) and Kirch's
technical arm, BetaTechnik, are now forming a joint company to develop
a standardised digital decoder and conditional access system for the
German market.

"There are still questions to be answered such as distribution,
technical details and the exact shareholder structure," said Kirch
spokesman Johannes Schmitz. "It's a new situation for us. Both sides
could have blocked each other, so we decided to join the MMBG and work
on a common decoder system."

After Deutsche Telekom's decision to opt for the MMBG's Mediabox
decoder technology, dismissing Kirch's "offer" on the grounds that
insufficient technical information on the decoder and conditional
access system was submitted and Telekom's tender protocol was not
adhered to (C&SE Vol.12, No.24), Kirch's position looked very
uncertain.

Without Deutsche Telekom, Kirch did not have the 16 million German
cable homes, key to the digital developments in Germany and was left
with an order for one million Nokia decoders - it is still unclear what
will become of this order. "The order stands firm. The decoders can be
used in other markets [such as Scandinavia]," offered Schmitz. The
decision by Kirch to join the MMBG has been welcomed by the members of
the consortium, for it prevents the situation which the MMBG wanted to
avoid all along - having two competing decoder systems in the German
market - which could only serve to fragment the market and confuse the
consumer.

Kirch is reportedly to take an 8.8% stake in MMBG, along with
Bertelsmann, CLT and ARD/ZDF, while Canal Plus and RTL are expected to
hold a 4.4% stake. Kirch reportedly demanded an 11% share along with
Bertelsmann, but was blocked by the other MMBG members who refused to
let Kirch muscle in at the last moment and steal the show.

5% will be held by broadcasters including the oRF and the SRG and the
Bauer publishing house. Deutsche Telekom and cable operator Vebacom
will hold the remaining 51% share. Further cable operators are expected
to join the Telekom/Vebacom stake.

The German cartel authorities have initially agreed to the new
constellation of the MMBG. Their wish for as many service providers and
service carriers as possible to be included in the consortium now
seemingly fulfilled. The MMBG still has to be approved by the EC,
while, the German media authorities are concerned that the decoder
system is as open and non-discriminatory as the MMBG claims it will be.

Kirch's compromise with the MMBG is also good news for Germany's only
pay-TV channel, Premiere, which is to play a vital role in the launch
of digital television. Premiere had been caught in the middle of the
MMBG versus Kirch digital decoder fray - its main shareholders being
Canal Plus, Bertelsmann and Kirch. A common decoder system will now be
able to be offered to the channel's one million subscribers.

OVER 300 GET THE AXE IN NYNEX RESTRUCTURE

Nynex CableComms, the UK's second largest cable company, is cutting its
workforce by 310 employees - including a 20% cut at executive director
level - as part of a major restructuring forecast to reduce overheads
by #7 million to #10 million per year.

"Nynex came out very low in an efficiency comparison with other cable
operators published last October by Goldman Sachs. The restructuring
was entirely forecastable," commented Neil Blackley, media analyst at
Goldman Sachs.

Despite the improved cost/revenue balance, and the positive
presentation of the move by Nynex as 'restructuring for growth', to
create what Allen Saunders, executive director corporate communications
at Nynex CableComms described as "a new, leaner Nynex", the initial
market reaction was negative, with shares dropping 1.5p. Longer term, a
more positive response on shares is expected, but Nynex had
underperformed the market by 25% over the last three months.

With the departure of former president Eugene Connell to the US, John
Killian has been appointed joint CEO and president at Nynex CableComms,
his former separate role of chief financial officer disappearing.
Similarly, Sally Davies, responsible for regulatory affairs and
development, is moving to Nynex in the US, her duties spread among
other staff.

And as the company consolidates to a central sales organisation, with
centralised installation, maintenance and repair and customer services,
there will no longer be separate North and South directors of
operations, with the director of operations South, Peter Morse,
resigning. Accounting and management support are expected to see most
losses, through a combination of natural wastage, voluntary and
involuntary redundancies.

"The cuts are spread across the board, geographically, with no sacred
disciplines, and affecting all levels. We have revenue objectives which
we need to correlate with costs. If it had been a pure cost-cutting
exercise we could have just cut staff by 10% three months ago. Instead,
we have conducted a complete review with a 100-man team, and
consultants Coopers & Lybrand, which has just concluded," explained
Saunders.

He continued, "We have identified significant efficiency improvements
and are confident the new organisation is correctly sized to meet our
new business objectives. Our North and South areas will now report to a
single manager, no longer using different routes to the same
objectives."

Saunders also accepted that last year's performance was not up to
expectations, "We were delighted with our telephony penetration and low
churn, but we have never hidden our disappointment at the level of catv
penetration [18.9%] and this is still a priority issue to address."

Killian pointed out that Nynex has, "doubled in size each year since
1991," and now aims to cut life-cycle costs and achieve economies of
scale. But ironically, it is the two largest UK players, Nynex and
Telewest, which underperformed in the Goldman Sachs efficiency table,
while small players like Diamond Cable, General Cable, and Comcast UK
Cable did well.

Nynex's share price dropped to 104p at press time on January 9.

GRANADA, SKY LAUNCH GSKYB

Former Granada executive and currently controller of factual programmes
at the ITV Network Centre, Stuart Prebble, has been appointed as chief
executive of GSkyB, the new company set up by Granada and BSkyB, which
plans to launch eight new channels in late 1996. Travel Channel
commercial director Jerry Glover, meanwhile, has been named as managing
director (commercial) of GSkyB.

The GSkyB package will be available as part of Sky Multi-Channels and
will probably be spread across three transponders, possibly on Astra
1D, on which BSkyB still has some spare capacity.

The new channels will be led by Granada Gold Plus, which will offer
programming from the extensive libraries of both Granada and LWT,
including classic episodes of Coronation Street.

The other seven channels will cover a range of lifestyle topics: Health
and Beauty, Home and Garden, Food and Wine, Granada Good Life, Granada
Men and Motoring, Granada Talk TV and Granada TV Shopping Guide.

Granada Gold Plus will broadcast for 18 hours a day, while the
lifestyle channels will take the form of broadcasting blocks. Men and
Motoring, for example, will have a late evening slot, following on from
Granada Gold Plus.

All seven lifestyle channels will feature predominantly new
programming. Granada Talk TV will be produced at LWT's London studios,
while the other six channels will all come from the North West.

"This venture will open up a whole new avenue of custom programme
making," said chief operating officer of Granada Group and Chief
executive of Granada's television division, Charles Allen, "enabling us
to significantly expand our program production facilities in both
London and the North West." With the addition of a new air-time sales
team within Laser, Granada's London-based sales house, the new venture
is expected to create around 200 new positions.

Granada's economic interest in the channel is 60%, although its
ownership is limited to 20% under current regulations. However, Granada
is hoping the government will remove the ownership restrictions on
broadcasters becoming involved in satellite operations, and thus allow
it to increase its ownership in the new venture to reflect its economic
participation.

The cost of the venture is expected to be #25 million over its first
two years, including start-up costs of #10 million. It hopes to be in
profit in three years and repay the initial investment in four years.
In the long run Granada also hopes to develop these channels for the
international market.

AB LAUNCHES CHANNEL FOR DIGITAL BOUQUET

Leading French youth TV producer AB-Productions (Dorothee and sitcom
number one Helane et les Garaons) offered its young audience a new
channel for Christmas. Launched live during a party on December 7, AB
Channel 1 is broadcasting series and sitcoms programming via a Belgacom
transponder on Eutelsat II F1 at 13 degrees East.

AB1 is the first channel of a future digital bouquet, the seventh in
France, after those announced by Canal Plus, CLT, TF1, Arte, France
Television and France Telecom. According to AB, in a few months time
the current analogue Eutelsat transponder will be switched into a
multiplex of nine digital channels, each of them dedicated to a
thematic genre: classic movies, thrillers, cartoons, comedy, romance,
action films, documentaries and adult.

Two other transponders would be used afterwards to upgrade the offer to
25 digital channels within two years. The digital package will be
offered to DTH viewers as well as cable. For the latter, AB's policy
will be to let the MSOs use their own conditional access if desired, in
exchange for offering the whole package.

Such an ambitious project has aroused surprise and doubt among the
French media world, especially since AB-Productions is a small company
in comparison to the TV giants engaged in the digital race.

It is understood that the company is in talks with four companies with
the aim of acquiring a whole package, including an encryption system, a
set-top-box and a subscription management service, but AB declined to
comment if such names as Canal Plus, France Telecom, Nethold or Kirch
are among the candidates.

Despite the choice of a Hot Bird slot, the channel's audience is
limited to the few motorised dish owners who receive the 12GHz band of
the transponder thanks to their multiband converters, indispensable to
receive the French channels elsewhere, on the Telecom 2 satellites. The
majority of the million or so French DTH viewers use fixed dishes with
monoband converters: 12 GHz LNBs for Telecom 2 or 11 GHz LNBs for the
Astra and Eutelsat series.

Cable is therefore essential to increase the audience. AB1 was granted
a cable licence by the CSA on December 21, despite the fact that the
channel currently screens mostly US-made products from the catalogue of
14,000 hours of programming that AB-Productions acquired on
international markets. Negotiations have already begun with French
cable operators.

Capacity is scarce on most cable networks, especially in Paris where
the basic tier is full and only two D2 Mac upper-tier channels remain
vacant. According to Videopole, it could be the first company to offer
AB1, if negotiations over the price lead to an agreement. AB is asking
a Ffr 2,50 per subscriber per month carriage fee after a six-month free
trial.

FRANCE TELECOM SLAMMED IN REPORT

French minister for Post, Telecommunications and Space, Franaois
Fillon, unveiled last week the main points of the report he ordered
last September from Georges Vanderchmitt, a former adviser of French
audit body Cour des Comptes. Fearing that France could miss out in the
digital race by having too many digital bouquet projects, Fillon
demanded a clear overview of the country's policy on satellite
telecommunications.

The Vanderchmitt report recommends the creation of a "digital super
alliance" between all the major French players, (public and private)
with broadcasters' access to the set-top boxes ensured "under fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions". The report insists on
the necessity to guarantee competition among the players inside the
alliance while having a strong policy on an external offer. Thanks to
digital technology, the latter should be adapted to the different
geographical zones it targets.

Vanderchmitt foresees that the digital market should be supervised
together by the CSA and the Conseil de la Concurrence (competition
body).

In his report, Vanderchmitt wants at the same time "to help Eutelsat to
set up a credible alternative to Astra" by changing the organisation's
structure, while he would also "establish stronger links" with Astra.
The Luxemburg system could be, according to him, "the dominant operator
in the French sky within the next three years".

The Telecom 3 series of crafts, however, is condemned by the report
which underlines the fact that Telecom 2D still has no clients.
Moreover, Vanderchmitt claims that France Telecom paid "too little
attention to marketing" and is now "marginalized and isolated". The
report concludes that the company is not in a situation to compete
anyway and should give up its DTH activities, by slipping "towards a
role of satellite services provider" only.

Commenting on the Vanderchmitt report, minister Fillon said France
Telecom's role in satellite television needs to be "redefined" and
recommended "more cooperation" with Eutelsat. Fillon also stressed that
the prejudice against the SES has to be ended and agreed with the
report's remarks that cable and satellite jurisdictions have to be
harmonized and lightened, mainly by bringing French law in line with
the European directive on transfrontier broadcasting signals.

Fillon revealed that he has ordered another report from former TDF
general director Philippe Levrier on whether or not to develop digital
terrestrial television.

BBC SEEKS EXPLANATION OF ORBIT 'CENSORSHIP'

The BBC is to "investigate as a matter of the utmost importance"
reports that Orbit has been censoring its Arabic news channel's
coverage of the case of Saudi dissident Mohammed al-Mas'ari. Senior BBC
and Orbit representatives were due to meet to discuss the alleged
editorial interference as CSE went to press.

According to Arabic and UK press reports, blackouts of the BBC's al-
Mas'ari reports started on Friday 5 January and continued over the
weekend. A spokesman for BBC Worldwide, which produces the Arabic-
language channel under a long-term contract with Orbit, said that
reports of "repeated interruptions" to the service had been confirmed -
but it was not yet clear whether this was deliberate censorship of the
al-Mas'ari deportation story or a "technical fault...we do not yet know
the source of the interruptions," he said.

Orbit was "concerned" about the reports and would be "looking into the
matter", a spokesman said - but would not comment further beyond
insisting that "reports of subscribers seeking compensation are
unfounded".

If the blackouts were deliberate, Orbit will have infringed the terms
of its contract with BBC Worldwide which guaranteed the editorial
independence of the service, as well as its pledges not to resort to
censorship. The BBC spokesman said that coverage of the Mas'ari case
would continue on the Arabic channel - "there has been further coverage
this week" - whatever the outcome.

For Saudi-owned Orbit, which already faces the problem of a patchily-
enforced dish ban in its home market, the al-Mas'ari affair coincided
with the first week of hard encryption - and thus could hardly have
come at a worse time. It had to face the dilemma of whether to risk
enraging the Saudi government, notoriously intolerant of journalistic
enquiry into its dealings, or of upsetting its partner and its
potential subscribers, just at the point when they were being asked to
pay for the first time. And also just before the launch of the rival
MultiChoice digital DTH package into which - it's not too hard to
imagine - a BBC-type news service could fit very well.

DR/TV2 LAUNCH DANISH SPORTS PAY-TV CHANNEL

Danish public service broadcasters, Danmarks Radio (DR) and commercial
channel TV2, together with state-controlled  Danish Telecom and Tele
Danmark are to launch a sports pay-TV channel, primarily aimed at the
some 1.3 million households (some 60% of the total population)
connected to cable systems. The new channel will eventually be also
offered via satellite to private DTH owners.

The as yet unnamed channel will primarily broadcast sports (mostly
football, the most popular sport in Denmark), as well as films and
popular entertainment.

The new project seems to have been triggered by the big deal recently
struck by DR and TV2 with the Danish Football Union - described as
"historical" by the Danish press, partly because of the amount of money
involved, and partly because it is the first time DR and TV2 have
joined forces, to fend off competition from the private commercial TV
sector.

The contract with the Danish Football Union is for eight years with a
price tag of over DKr0.5 billion, (#58m). For that money, the new pay-
TV channel, DR and TV2 will have the rights to all Danish football
(also international matches) of public interest.

Per Kregh Simonsen, head of sports at DR, commented, "From our side it
required quite a new way of commercial thinking. And without our trump
card, the new pay service, we would never had been able to land the
contract."

One snag in the project, is that under Danish law, Tele Danmark is not
allowed to be involved in programming operations, but it is expected
that the law will be changed by the Danish parliament this summer.

Despite the law, Tele Danmark, which is expected to put up most of the
investment money for the project, has obviously had plans to launch a
pay-TV service for some time. One year ago, it recruited one of
Denmark's most respected personalities in the film and media business,
Bo Christiansen, who has a long history with Denmark's biggest film and
media group, Nordisk Film, and is believed to have been instrumental in
planning the new sports service. Peter Herforth, former MD of Nordisk
Film Production, was recently hired to manage the new station.

The new pay-TV service will be offered at a monthly fee of DKr100 and
is expected to break even with a subscriber level of around 200,000
households.

NETHOLD/TV4 FORM STRATEGIC ALLIANCE

Swedish TV4 and Nethold Nordic have formed a strategic alliance. From
occasional collaboration in recent years - mainly in the sports field -
the leading Swedish commercial station and the increasingly
multinational Nethold have now realised their cooperation into a fully-
fledged alliance. Furthermore, TV4 and FilmNet have jointly taken over
an office building in Stockholm that used to be the Swedish head-
quarters of Philips.

Jan Friedman, vice president of Nethold Nordic, said the new alliance
would "spread throughout" the two companies, and that it would also
lead to similar alliances with local broadcasters in other Nordic
territories.

TV4 and Nethold/FilmNet have identified a number of areas where the new
alliance will take effect: Joint acquisitions of programme rights, both
to films and mini-series, sports and other big events. Instrumental in
this area is Nethold's acquisitions organisation, Holland-based ProNet.

Friedman points out that in Europe, ProNet acquires rights for FilmNet
not only in the Nordic Countries and Benelux, but also in Poland, Czech
Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary, Greece, Cyprus and Italy: Joint
co-production of Swedish movies and TV-movies together with local
production companies. Over a three-year period TV4 and FilmNet will
invest SKr 30 million (#3m), of which FilmNet will provide one third.
"We will also cooperate in producing other kinds of programming, like
fillers and film magazines", said Friedman.

If and when TV4 launches its second channel, satellite-delivered TV4
Plus, as it is called internally, it will be exclusively distributed
via Nethold's digital platforms. The parties have also agreed to
include the existing TV4 transmissions, also with exclusive satellite
rights, on the Nethold platform.

Nethold's SMS operation, MultiChoice, will also be made available for
TV4 in many different areas. Nethold's digital platforms are expected
to be used by TV4 in future news services, home shopping, games etc.

In the sports field, where FilmNet and TV4 have already established
different ways of cooperating, for instance in sharing rights like the
Swedish national ice hockey league and the English Premier Football
League, plans are now to establish shared programme archives, research
functions and news desk services for TV4 .

FilmNet is already a client for the TV4 air-time sales group, but the
airtime bought in the future by FilmNet is expected to increase
considerably.

It has been hinted in the Swedish trade press that a future element of
cross-ownership would be a very plausible development of the new
strategic alliance.

STRONG SALES FOR DTH IN 1995

UK sales of satellite receiving equipment revitalised during 1995.
BSkyB reports that 904,555 units were sold during 1995, however this
will include non-domestic sales, to pubs, sports and social clubs
together with resales between satellite retailers.

Included in the total is the largest ever sales figure for a single
week, 40,153, for the week ending December 16. The total amount of
sales in December was 111,320. The actual installed base of satellite
homes increased by 339,000 reflecting replacement sales and churn.

According to Continental Research, on December 31, 1995 the installed
base of UK satellite homes had risen to 3.698 million, including 55,000
smatv homes. The number of UK smatv homes has progressively fallen over
recent years, often resulting from the growth of cable services.
Continental estimates the total of UK cable homes at December 31 to be
1.205 million.

The UK DTH market has been spurred by the offer of "under #100"
receivers from manufacturers including Pace and, under the Minerva
brand, Grundig. According to market research company GfK, Pace now
holds over 40% of the UK market with Pace increasing its volume sales
for November year-on-year by 66%.

The combined growth of DTH and cable homes for the fourth quarter of
1995 was 232,000. New dish installations - replacement sales continue
to run at a little over one in three - represented 135,000 homes
eclipsing cable at 97,000.

Cable installations had been running ahead of new dish homes. The DTH
renaissance can be attributed to pre-Christmas sales, particularly in
non-cable areas, where the only way to gain access to the new media
channels is through a dish. The launch of Astra 1D, which operates at
frequencies lower than a majority of the installed base of equipment
can receive, will also be a factor.

According to Continental Research director David Chilvers, in order for
cable to reach more homes the installed base would have to consistently
grow at over 100,000 more per quarter than DTH homes - a target which
cable has so far found unattainable. At this rate cable would still not
eclipse DTH until well after the turn of the century.

A new study by Continental shows that the saturation point for cable
and satellite television in the UK to be 35%. The 35% penetration,
equivalent to eight million homes, is in line with Continental's last
major forecast produced, separately, last April.

Chilvers added that generation effects will create an impact in around
20 years time creating a slow build up in penetration. Chilvers likens
future growth to the telephone where penetration grew quickly to 80%,
but the last 20% is proving more difficult.

DIGITAL DTH OUTSHINES CABLE PROSPECTS

Cable penetration rates could be significantly held back in European
markets where digital direct-to-home pay-per-view has first-mover
advantages, according to a new circular from SBC Warburg.

The investment bank, whose conclusions are based on the last 18 months
of satellite-delivered PPV in the US, says with average DirecTv and
USSB subscribers generating PPV sales of $17 (#11) per month, "the
signs are that PPV can become a really significant generator of
business for BSkyB and Canal Plus. In our BSkyB model, we
conservatively estimate PPV revenues in 2002 of #200 million. Based on
the US experience, that implies about 800,000 subscribers spending #10
per month. We could easily be a factor of five times too low."

"This is not good news for the European cable industry, and those
operators who are either still building out their networks or who have
not yet upgraded narrowband... may find progress difficult if digital
satellite has first-mover advantages," claims SBC Warburg.

DirecTv, which has targeted operational breakeven for the second half
of this year, or three million subscribers, notched up its one
millionth customer in November. SBC Warburg says the Hughes-backed
venture has been scoring PPV buy rates of between 150 and 200 per cent
on some of its movies - five to six times higher than on cable.

According to the report, European Media Monthly, in October last year
almost 80% of DirecTv and USSB subscribers registered PPV buys, with
3.78 the average number of monthly purchases. Estimated PPV revenue for
the month was $13 million for DirecTv and USSB, and $16 million for
cable operator-backed DTH service Primestar.

PPV on US cable, meanwhile, has been plagued by poor release windows, a
lack of channel capacity and confusing listing schedules in TV guides,
says SBC Warburg.

By comparison, DirecTv and the other digital DTH service providers are
devoting 60-plus channels to near-video-on-demand PPV and have
developed more user-friendly electronic programme guides.

More bad news for the cable industry, says the bank, is that DirecTv,
which is growing at a rate of 90,000-100,000 new subscribers per month,
has been recruiting up to 50% of its customer base from cabled areas,
while over 40% were or continue to be subscribers to cable.
"Furthermore, those subscribers lured away tend to be the big spenders
who part with more than $60 per month to feed their TV appetites,"
notes the report.

Cable operators hoping to fend off digital DTH with local programming
services may also be disappointed, suggests SBC Warburg, since "these
are not a driver of subscriber take-up."

NEW DEBATE ON GERMAN BROADCASTING LAW

Only four weeks after the premiers of each of Germany's 16 states
reached a compromise on the long-disputed new broadcasting act, a new
list of controversial points have come to the fore.

The main bone of contention is the media ownership rules and whether
new media or digital services will require licences from the media
authorities. The SPD-governed states are now demanding that no single
owner can have a significant stake in companies which together hold an
audience share of 25%. This would mean, for example, that the Kirch
Group could not hold stakes in channels which have a market share over
25%. If the stake exceeds 30%, new anti-trust regulation would come
into force. Besides this strongly-criticised point, the social
democrats want television channels with over 10% marketshare to be
obliged to distribute their programming within an independent company.
Spiegel TV has its own licence scheduling its magazines on Sat l and
RTL Television. If the other premiers agree to these new demands, the
social democrats will agree to the media ownership ruling allowing
shareholders to own 100% in one television channel, 49.9% in the next
and 24.9% in other special interest programmes.

To control all these regulations, the prime ministers intend to
establish a new media concentration commission (KEK) acting alongside
the media authorities. The commission would be closely involved in the
decisions of the media authorities.

There is also a question mark over the limits on public programming and
its financing. Much of the monthly public fee of DM 23,80 (#10.70) is
needed to fund the ARD and its member stations administration. Many
politicians and commercial stations are demanding that ARD and ZDF stop
their expansion and broadcast news, information, culture, children's
programming and a mixture of entertainment as in the past.

The commission for financing public broadcasting KEF has to come up
with a proposal for the next broadcasting fee which runs from 1997 to
the year 2000. According to the government of Lower Saxony, the
broadcasting fee will increase to DM28.25 a month - an increase of
DM4.45. The ARD will receive DM2.35 and ZDF DM2.05. The money will help
fund a new parliamentary and a children's channel to be launched by the
ARD from 1997 - a move strongly criticised by private broadcasters
association VPRT, which fears that the new publicly-financed special
interest channels will target commercial channels as Nickelodeon and
all-news channels such as N-TV.

On February 8, the premiers will meet again to try and reach a new
agreement on the act.

UAP VERSIONS TCC AND DISCOVERY

United Artists Programming has introduced a version of TCC for the
Nordic market and for Discovery in the Netherlands. TCC has now also
been withdrawn from the Dutch market though minimal distribution
through the VideoCrypt II package will continue for the time being.

A backhaul was introduced on January 1 for TCC Nordic to feed the Thor
satellite which has previously taken the single UK-produced version
from Astra. The backhaul is at present transmitted in clear analogue
Pal from Intelsat 601, though the intention is to switch to an
encrypted feed in the near future.

UAP vice president, distribution Andrew Shaw said that soundtracks in
the four Scandinavian languages - Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and
Finnish - would represent 45% of TCC Nordic's output. He said TCC had
reached the point in the Nordic region where such local versioning was
feasible. 80% of TCC subscribers in Scandinavia are now able to view
the Nordic version and Shaw expects this to be brought up to a near
100% within a few months. At the same time TCC is, at 1.2 million
homes,  closing the distribution gap on Discovery, the result of the
transponder share on Thor, which allows cable operators to take a
seamless feed of the two channels.

General manager Franklin Getchell said TCC Nordic had been created as a
totally separate service running for 12 hours a day as opposed to the
11 hours of the Astra service. TCC is on-air between 06.00 and 18.00
CET. "The 12 hours will be a mix of programming. All of the live action
programming will be regionalised, the pre-school will be added by the
end of the year." Programming for older children, including some of the
high-profile animation will be subtitled. For younger children dubbing
will be used where the rights allow it. Three quarters will be dubbed
by the end of 1996.

The decision to withdraw TCC from the Dutch market follows the
acquisition by parent company Flextech of a 33% share in the Dutch
language children's channel Kindernet. While Kindernet has a virtual
saturation penetration of the market at 5.5 million, TCC is only
available to 850,000 homes, principally in the Rotterdam area. TCC's
long-time refusal to pay for carriage in the region means distribution
is unlikely to increase further.

Discovery Channel, which has been available in the Netherlands since
1989 and is available in 4.3 million homes, will carry Dutch continuity
announcements on a separate audio subcarrier. In addition Discovery
will be increasing the amount of programming reversioned into the Dutch
language and intends to buy some Dutch documentaries. Teletext
subtitling in the Dutch language will be expanded with the goal of
offering subtitles on 95% of output by the end of the year.

BSKYB JOINS RTR FOR RUSSIAN BOUQUET?

Russian national public broadcaster RTR has forged a joint venture with
a "unnamed UK partner" to launch the country's first digital satellite-
delivered service from Intelsat 604. Sources suggest that this UK
partner is none other than British Sky Broadcasting. According to
Stanislav Bunievich, the station's deputy chairman and director of
engineering, RTR Network has formed a joint venture with a UK partner
(he declined to give a name) to launch - at a cost of between $10 to
$15 million (#6.5-9.7m) for equipment alone - two channels (sport and
movies) this spring. Distributed by Intelsat 604, they will probably be
followed by further channels for medical, business and children's
television and be available to an audience of some 40 million
"collective customers" - such as those served by cable networks -
throughout the former Soviet Union.

Bunievich says the idea behind the RTR Network is to introduce viewers
to the idea of paying for their programming, which in his view is now
"the main way for television to develop in Russia." It is also an
attempt to make the broadcaster less dependent on the government for
its funding and lessen the burden of having to pay 75% of its revenue
to the ministry of telecommunications for the use of transmission
facilities.

Although RTR Network is currently negotiating agreements with several
foreign programme-providers, Bunievich feels there is a need for
Russian material which it will have to meet. He also believes there
will be exceptionally strong interest shown in the new service's
children's and medical channels and that within the next two to five
years RTR, though remaining state-owned, will become a holding company
for RTR Network and other commercial ventures.

HUNGARIAN COMMERCIAL TV IN THE WINGS

Hungary is soon to have commercial television now that the Hungarian
Parliament has finally passed the long-awaited broadcasting bill, which
is now waiting to be approved by the Hungarian president. In mid-
October, the six main parliamentary parties in Hungary came to a back
room agreement over the future of the nation's state-run television
stations and the law was passed at the end of December.

The broadcasting bill will have the greatest effect on state-owned TV
network Magyar Televizio (MTV) which now faces the prospect of its
second public chain MTV2 being privatised. The terrestrial frequency of
MTV2 will be offered in concession for ten years and the current MTV2
programme will be aired by satellite with an intended viewership of
ethnic Hungarians both inside and outside contemporary national
borders. The largest commercial radio station Danubius will also be
privatised. The main state channel, MTV1 and satellite-delivered
channel Duna TV will remain largely untouched, however.

Saatchi & Saatchi Budapest senior media planner Andreas Vigh says that
another terrestrial frequency will be opened [in the public tender],
possibly under the name of MTV3, which, at the beginning, would have
60% to 70% penetration. This national channel will also be offered in
concession for ten years. The arrival of commercial television in
Hungary is set to kick-start the industry, he says. "The state channels
will have to become much more competitive and produce better quality
programming."

MTV2 which has an 80% penetration rate will be privatised with a view
towards starting up in January of 1997, along with the new MTV3.

A tender for MTV2 is expected to be announced sometime this spring and
applications will be due in July or August. The new private channel
will most likely begin broadcasting the following January. But before
the tender is announced, the new media council will have to be
appointed, and the council's first order of business will be replacing
the director of MTV, Adam Horvath, who resigned as of January 1996.
Under the draft law, the director's powers will be significantly
reduced.

Several major media investors are expected to enter the tender for the
private channel, including MTM Communications, which has entered into a
joint venture with Scandinavian Broadcasting Systems (SBS) last
September, Central European Media Enterprises (CME), which is currently
preparing a regional TV channel in the Budapest area with the Hungarian
company 2002, and CLT. French broadcaster TF1 is also reportedly in the
running as is TV Nova operator Marc Palmer.

PREMIERE TOPS ONE MILLION SUBSCRIBERS

The first German pay-TV channel Premiere reported around 1.1 million
subscribers at the beginning of the new year 1996 generating revenues
of about DM500 million (#227m), making Premiere the fourth largest
commercial TV station in Germany, announced managing director Bernd
Kundrun. Premiere has invested about DM600 million (#273m) over the
last five years and Kundrun forecast that the company would break even
this year.

Kundrun said that the decision of MMBG and Kirch Group to develop a
standardised digital decoder was a signal for Premiere to start the
first trials in the interactive world. To produce and distribute 12
digital programmes, a company has to invest about DM 5.1 billion
(#2.3bn) over a five year period on the basis of about two million
subscribers, he said. But the revenues in the same period would only
amount to DM1.2 billion, if the subscribers pay a monthly fee of DM50.
This means digital programmes will remain a very risky business in the
next few years, he said.

In the spring, Premiere will start a trial with 1,000 households in
Hamburg. Partners in the venture are publishing companies Bauer, Axel
Springer and Gruner & Jahr/Bertelsman, retailer Otto Versand, facility
house Studio Hamburg (subsidiary of public broadcaster NDR) and
Deutsche Telekom.

CME LAUNCHES SLOVENIAN POP TV

Slovenia's broadcasting industry has received a major boost following
the launch of the country's first national independent television
service. Backed by the US-owned investment company Central European
Media Enterprises (CME) and the local stations MMTV (based in
Ljubljana) and Tele 59 (Maribor), Pop TV - a television programme
trademark of the company Pro Plus - will offer a mixture of
entertainment and information programming and initially reach some 70%
of the country's 650,000 television households.

CME, which already has direct equity interests of 58% and 33% in Pro
Plus and MMTV respectively, will shortly also acquire 33% of Tele 59.
With both its Slovenian partners also major shareholders in Pro Plus,
it will effectively have a 72% economic interest in the new venture.

According to Len Fertig, the president and CEO of CME, total investment
in Pro Plus is likely to be between #10-11.5 million, of which the
company will provide 58% and MMTV and Tele 59 the remainder. While
having to compete in an industry already served by a national public
broadcaster (TV Slovenija) and several local commercial stations
including the long-established Kanal A, the country's healthy TV ad
market (which stood at #15m) in 1994) and per capita income (#4,000)
one of the highest in central and eastern Europe) are likely to ensure
the service's survival.

Pro Plus, whose programming will be entertainment led and targeted at a
young audience, has secured agreements with most Hollywood majors and
hopes to obtain exclusive rights for Slovenian soccer. While initially
conforming to a minimum local production quota of 10%, it intends to
raise the level to 40% by the end of this year.

Although Pop TV has effectively guaranteed its status as a national
Slovenian broadcaster through being distributed by MMTV, Tele 59, TV
Robin (which serves western parts of the country) and several cable
networks, an agreement with Euro 3, a privately owned service employing
a powerful transmitter in Krvavec to cover Ljubljana and environs, fell
through after objections by Kanal A.

The latter, which is owned by Vladimir Polic and had itself at one
stage been involved in talks with CME, is believed to have a
controlling stake in Euro 3 and felt undermined by the latter's deal
with the media investment company. It is also beset by serious
financial problems and has recently benefited from a programming
agreement with Turner.

The launch of Pro Plus and its associated television network Pop TV by
CME has come shortly after the establishment of Media Pro
International, a company which will manage a new commercial network
named Pro TV in Romania. With other projects either being prepared or
up and running (and in some instances, such as the Czech Republic's TV
Nova, already highly successful), CME is rapidly becoming one of the
leading players in central and eastern Europe's television industry. As
a result, some form of networking (and therefore satellite
distribution) of its services throughout the region is a distinct
possibility in the near future.

Within Slovenia, the appearance of Pro Plus/Pop TV has nevertheless
overshadowed the launch of a further new national channel. Set up at a
cost of DM10 million (#4.5m) and backed by the Catholic Church and
several local institutions, TV3 will terrestrially broadcast around 20
hours of family-oriented programming daily to around 80% of the
population.

RADICAL CHANGES AT POLONIA 1

The Polish satellite channel Polonia 1 has begun 1996 under new
management and with a radical change in programming policy.

Set up by the Italian entrepreneur Nicola Grauso barely four years ago,
it initially operated as an unlicensed network of local terrestrial
stations before being forced out of the country and deciding to
distribute its programming by Eutelsat. On January 1 its ownership
officially passed into the hands of Mariano Vollani - once the leading
shareholder in the Czech commercial station Premiera TV - along with
several Polish and foreign investors.

According to Katarzyna Kieci, the marketing manager of Publipolska (an
agency which undertakes all commercial activities for Polonia 1), the
broadcaster will attempt to move away from the perceived image of being
a service aimed solely at women by targeting men, people aged up to 40
and young urban families.

The first changes to the 24-hour service's programming - which Kieci
says can be received by around 28% of the population - should occur in
the first week in February and the remainder will be gradually
implemented over the following month to six weeks. Besides carrying
more music, it will also show sport, news and information (with
material obtained from Euronews) and a wide range of films and
documentaries.

VIACOM POISED FOR MID-EAST LAUNCH

Viacom is developing two new channels for its five-channel Ku-Band
digital DTH package for the Middle East, which is expected to launch
via PanAmSat 4 during the first quarter.

The package will include MTV Europe and VH-1 UK, as well as a movie
channel - expected to be a version of Showtime - and new general
entertainment and children's/family channels.

Although Viacom would not elaborate on marketing plans for the service
prior to an official launch announcement "within the next two weeks,"
it is understood the package will be offered alongside ART and Nethold
channels as part of MultiChoice's Middle Eastern digital DTH operation.
This is to use the same MPEG-2/DVB standard with Irdeto conditional
access as the South African DSTV service, for which Pace has been
contracted to supply 200,000 decoders. Pace, while it has yet to ship
any DVB units into the region, is already priming its Middle Eastern
dealers with its digital 'Gold Club' scheme.

The launch of the MultiChoice mid-East bouquet, initially intended to
be pre-Christmas, is understood to have been put back to give the
partners more time to develop services which would be sufficiently
distinct from the analogue-free-to-air ART channels already popular in
the region.

CHANNEL V LAUNCHES THAI MUSIC CHANNEL

Channel V, the Star TV-owned music channel has formed a three party
deal to create and broadcast a 24-hour customised music channel for
Thailand. The new venture, to be called Channel V Thailand, is a
partnership between Channel V, pay-TV licensee Universal Cable Network
Public Company Ltd (UTV), and Broadcasting Network (Thailand) Ltd
(BNT). The latter is a 12 year old Thai company specialising in concert
promotion and music licensing.

The new channel, which is set to launch mid-March, will be an ad-free
subscription channel and will form part of UTV's premium programming
tier, although as yet the "appropriate pricing point has yet to be
decided," said Channel V executive producer Steve Greider.

As with the two other localised versions of Channel V - for India and
Taiwan, Channel V Thailand will be heavily reliant on localisation,
with most of the programming to be either dubbed or produced in Thai
and fronted by local Thai VJs. Initially, said Greider, 60% of music
videos will be Thai with the remaining 40% international. The
partnership has already built a studio in which to customise and make
new productions.

The deal with UTV is despite the fact that Star TV also has a carriage
deal on rival service ThaiSky Cable's MMDS service. According to
Greider, Star chose to go with UTV as Thaisky already has its own music
service called Smile TV. Greider said Channel V Thailand will compete
favourably with Smile TV as it will be a "much better looking channel,
that is truly Thai but produced to an international standard."

UTV is currently broadcasting 35 channels down its 64-channel capacity
fibre-optic cable network which is currently being laid in the greater
Bangkok area.

It is also rumoured that UTV and Star TV may collaborate further to
form a DTH package for Thailand. This would be beneficial to both, as
UTV would then be able to use Asiasat 2 as a distribution platform
(currently it only has C-Band capacity on Thaicom 1 and 2) and, in
turn, Star TV would gain access to the Thai DTH market by piggy-backing
on UTV's required pay-TV licence. Currently it is estimated that there
are some 400,000 back yard C-band dishes owners in Thailand, many of
whom already received Star TV.

The market for pay-TV in Thailand is both intensifying and
consolidating. In December 1995, Thai terrestrial broadcaster and pay-
TV licensee Channel 3 and Hong Kong based satellite broadcaster TVBI,
announced the formation of a joint venture company, the TVB3 Network Co
Ltd, which will launch a full service Thai language general
entertainment channel to be called Asia Entertainment Network in early
1997, using Thai dubbed Chinese programmes and Thai language programmes
produced by the joint venture company.

CZECH CABLE AND SATELLITE DEREGULATION

The Czech Parliament implemented several changes to the broadcasting
law in mid-December. It has approved extending the broadcasting rights
of CT2, the second nationwide channel, to public broadcaster Czech
Television for an indefinite period. Under a law passed in December
1992, Czech Television was granted only temporary possession of the
frequency, because the legislation agreed at that time that the second
frequency should eventually be privatised.

As of January 1, 1996, potential cable/satellite operators no longer
have to apply to the Czech Broadcasting Council for a licence, although
they must still register with the council. The council no longer has
the authority to regulate programming conditions for cable and
satellite operators. Potential operators must still obtain clearance
from the Czech telecommunication authority and a construction permit
from the municipality where the cable system will operate. The law
further reduces advertising restrictions on Czech Radio from 1% to 0.2%
for all five channels, although it is possible to group this time on
one station.

Industry analysts believe the deregulation of satellite and cable
broadcasting is partly the result of heavy lobbying on the part of HBO,
which feared the programming quotas the council wanted to implement on
cable operators which carry the pay-television channel. Some further
believe that the new decision is a compromise between supporters and
detractors of commercial broadcasting, citing that opponents of the
decision to allow Czech Television to retain its second channel were
rewarded for their support with far-reaching concessions in the
licensing of cable and satellite ventures.

Council member Helena Havledkova finds this analysis too subjective but
she agreed that the amendment, while fundamentally conforming to
European Convention regulations, is regarded as a victory for the cable
business. "HBO [and other cable operators] will be absolutely free to
do whatever they want with their programmes," she commented.

The Czech cable industry has experienced substantial investment from
foreign companies in the past two years from companies such as HBO,
which launched in the Czech Republic in November, 1994, US West
International, which purchased a 28% stake of Cable Plus, the largest
Czech cable operator, in May, 1995, and United International Holdings,
which has taken part in several cable ventures since 1993.

TERRESTRIALS SET TO TAKE ON SKY

The UK government published its broadcasting bill before Christmas
featuring some significant changes from its white paper proposals. The
new law is not expected to come into effect until summer, possibly as
late as January 1997.

Now ITV predators such as Granada, Carlton and Mai look set to flourish
under the new bill with the proposal for a two licence limit for ITV
operators abolished in favour of a new threshhold of 15% of total TV
audience. Bearing in mind that the largest ITV owner Carlton holds 9.4%
of the total audience, the scope for expansion and takeovers is great.

All but the two largest newspaper owners (News International and Mirror
group) will be able to control commercial television licences for the
first time, favouring a greater cross-ownership between newspaper
groups, TV companies and radio.

Existing terrestrial broadcasters are to be given much more digital
capacity in the new bill with the BBC awarded the best multiplex, and
ITV, Channel 5 and Channel 5 awarded half a multiplex each. In return,
the broadcasters have to air their existing channels in their entirety
in digital though they have been allowed to offer pay-TV services -
vital for their survival. With sports rights being snapped up by BSkyB,
while NBC bid $2.3 billion (#1.5bn) for the Olympics, the fear is that
the fierce bidding will also spread to entertainment. The freedom to
run a universally free and premium pay channel will place the
terrestrial broadcasters in a much more powerful position to fend off
Sky.

The government has retreated on the idea of a final date for a complete
move from analogue to digital. Instead, the analogue switch off date
will be reviewed once 50% of UK households can receive digital
terrestrial channels, or five years after the start of the first
multiplex licence.

BET ON JAZZ FOR AFRICA

Black Entertainment Television's 24-hour jazz channel, BET On Jazz: The
Cable Jazz Channel, is to join MultiChoice's South African DTH package,
DSTV, on April 1, three months after the channel launches on cable
networks in the US.

The service, first mooted in 1993 and understood to be costing $20-30
million to launch, will be offered alongside DSTV's existing 18
channels from PanAmSat 4 at no extra cost, and will be marketed in
South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Mozambique and
Botswana. Both the channel and the MultiChoice deal are breakthroughs
for BET, which, with 43.4 million cable subscribers in North America
(at November 1995), and with its domestic business already well
diversified into related media and marketing activities, is now looking
to international markets for expansion.

"This is a very big move for us," BET International vice president
George Amoah said. "Although we've been supplying programming to
African broadcasters for the last year-and-a-half on a syndicated
basis, this is the first time we've launched there in such a big way."

BETI supplied Bop-TV with an eight-hour daily block of (chiefly
educational) programming which was distributed across African and the
Middle East from a C-Band Intelsat transponder, and now supplies
similar programming to SABC's NNTV, as well as to affiliates in Kenya
and Nigeria the Caribbean, and even to Poland.

"Our plans call for global expansion," Amoah added, "and we're going
into it aggressively... our initial focus is Europe and southern
Africa."

As in the US, where BET has developed a range of complementary
businesses, BETI intends to develop similar opportunities for programme-
related merchandise in South Africa, by building up relationship with
local businesses.

While Amoah indicated that BETI was eager to bring the jazz channel to
the UK and the rest of Europe, how it will do so - whether as a
complement to the London-based BETI cable exclusive service using
additional digital capacity on Orion, or by joining national digital
DTH packages - was not yet decided.

As the world's first dedicated jazz channel, BET On Jazz promises a mix
of live concerts, classic performances, jazz movies and documentaries,
and seems destined to find big ready-made audiences across Europe and
Scandinavia.

TELEGRAAF POISED TO ACQUIRE SBS6 STAKE

Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf says its negotiations to acquire a 30%
share in SBS6 are at an advanced stage. Bank Mees Pierson is acting as
mediator for the two parties. SBS has been looking for some time for a
Dutch partner, because the channel wants to strengthen its local
presence. SBS has strong financial backing including ABC/Cap Cities and
Paramount/Viacom, but a link with a major Dutch publishing house could
be beneficial for both parties and give the broadcaster a more Dutch
face. SBS experienced a slow start late last August, but now claims
about 92% cable penetration in the country as well as a slowly
increasing market share.

De Telegraaf currently has only very limited new media investments. The
company owns local radio station Radio Amsterdam as well as a cabletext
newspaper (with rolling text pages) also in its home town of Amsterdam.
Together with PCM Publishers De Telegraaf owns 5% in the A2000/KTA
Amsterdam cablenetwork. The company's investment in SBS6 would mark a
departure from its otherwise conservative acquisition policy. Dutch
publisher Wegener announced its talks to acquire the Arcade Media
Group, who owns TV10 Gold, The Music Factory and three radio stations,
have successfully ended. Wegener will take control of Arcade for an
undisclosed sum, which insiders estimate to be around Gld300 million
(#120m). The new company will be known as Wegener-Arcade. Arcade is
privately owned, with three quarter of the shares owned by
founder/president Herman Heinsbroek, who will remain with the new
company as a consultant. The second man of the company, A de Liefde,
will take a seat on the board of Wegener-Arcade.

POLL GAUGES BELGIAN SUBSCRIBER SATISFACTION

The quality of cable distribution varies depending on the region where
subscribers live, particularly regarding the number of programmes
available, the quality of the retransmission and the cable subscription
fee, according to a survey conducted by consumers' association Test-
Achats. Each of the 36 cable distributors operating in Belgium enjoys a
monopoly in its own franchise territory and not all of them have put
the same efforts into upgrading their network and meeting their
subscribers' wishes, notes Test-Achats.

The number of channels available on cable varies from 19 in the
Ardennes region to 37 in Limburg, while cable capacity ranges from 24
to 73 channels. The cost of a new connection varies from Bfr1,346 in
Brussels to Bfr4,033 (#29-#88) in some parts of Brabant, while the
delay required before being connected can be anything from 3 days to 3
weeks. As regards the subscription fee, it can vary from Bfr 4,000 to
Bfr 5,000 (#88-#108), but without any bearing on the number of channels
provided by the cable distributor.

The survey also shows that cable subscribers' chief complaint is lack
of consultation with them by cable companies regarding the choice of
channels they receive. In both linguistic regions, viewers show,
unsurprisingly, a strong preference for channels broadcasting in their
own language. However, it seems that, in Flanders, subscribers would
also like to have access to French-speaking channels such as Tele 21,
Club RTL, Arte, TV5 and Canal Plus, while French-speaking viewers in
Wallonia fell they are deprived of VTM, Filmnet and CNN. Obviously,
subscribers are not aware that copyright licences, administrative rules
and political motivations prevent cable distributors to broadcasting
Canal Plus in Flanders and FilmNet in Wallonia.

Test-Achats concludes, saying that, most subscribers seem satisfied
with their cable distributor, the average of dissatisfied subscribers
varying from 5 to 10%. The main reasons for dissatisfaction are lack of
consultation of customers (46%), the non-availability of certain
channels (35%) and poor reception quality.

MC EUROPE JOINS PREMIERE PACKAGE

Pay-TV channel Premiere is to trial Music Choice Europe's digital audio
service in a commercial trial this spring. The arrangement is expected
to lead to a full launch in the Cologne area during the autumn and a
national rollout in 1997 as part of Premiere's Astra-delivered digital
package. Competitor DMX expects to receive Astra carriage as part of
the MultiChoice package and already utilises capacity on the first four
Astras.

MC Europe sales and marketing director Jennifer Churchill said that a
number of pricepoints would be trialled on the Cologne network, which
has 268,000 homes connected. Existing pricing ranges from #7.45 per
month in the United Kingdom to an equivalent #12.00 in Norway. In
Cologne the pricing may be as low as DM5 per month, but as director of
business strategy Simon Bazalgette pointed out the cost of the rental
cost of the General Instrument decoder is generally included.

While adopted by Deutsche Telekom as its preferred premium audio
service MC Europe still has the task of applying to each of the 15
regional media authorities. To date licences have been applied for and
obtained from each of the larger regions; Bavaria, Northrhine
Westphalia and Hessen. MC Europe's themed music service includes local
channels such as Deutscher Rock, Golden Schlager and Volksmusik.

Chief executive Stuart Graber said MC Europe was building its
distribution and was now available in "well over eight million homes
all over Europe," including a significant deal recently concluded with
Telewest in the UK.

Asked about repeated rumours of a merger with the European operations
of DMX Graber responded that MC Europe had, "the right combination of
partners and the right strategy to do the job of building a business."
MC Europe had concentrated on the programming rather than the
technology. The two companies, said Graber, were considerably different
in their management style.

Churchill is confident of increasing the potential subscriber base to
over 20 million by the end of 1996. She sees further opportunities as
cable operators migrate towards digital services. "When we started it
was in analogue and we've been able to work with the cable operators,
they enjoy working with us, and all have plans to go digital.

MC Europe has now added Comcast's Cleveland and Darlington franchises
to its roster of UK cable operators. The service will potentially be
available to an additional 225,000 homes. It follows the rollout onto
the Birmingham franchise.

NOZEMA PLANS TO SHELVE CASEMA STAKE

Dutch transmission company Nozema wants to shelve its 22 % stake in
Dutch MSO Casema - and KPN is quick to express its interest in gaining
full control of the company. KPN now owns 76.7% of Casema, Holland's
major MSO with over 1.2 connected cable homes.

Nozema is a Dutch company that owns and operates the transmitters for
Dutch public and private television and radio broadcasters. The company
is partially privatised, but the Dutch government plans to sell the
remaining 59% share it still owns later this year. Once completely
privatised, Nozema will need to invest heavily in new transmitters for
the upcoming DAB and terrestrial digital television. Therefore, it
wants to shed its Casema shares and concentrate on its core business of
terrestrial broadcasting. Nozema has appointed the British bank
Rothschild to handle the sale of its share in Casema.

KPN's intention to buy up Nozema's shares in Casema have angered
Minister Jorristma of Transport and Communication, who says KPN's share
in Casema should be decreased. The minister is afraid that Dutch cable
companies will not start cable telephony in competition with KPN as
long as KPN is a major shareholder in Casema. After acquiring Nozema's
shares KPN would own 99.3% of Casema. The company wants to have a
strong hold on Casema when its planned merger with the cable systems of
Philips Media takes place.

Casema announced it wants to double its capital by issuing new shares.
The company says it needs fresh capital to invest in updating its cable
networks and offering new services. Casema plans to issue new shares
worth Gld175 million (#70m) only with its existing shareholders.

ARCADE GAINS AMSTERDAM ACCESS

From January 17 the two channels from the Arcade Media Group (TV10 and
The Music Factory) will at last be carried by the A2000/KTA network of
Amsterdam, but not all problems have been solved. A2000/KTA demands a
payment of Gld750,000 (#300,000) per channel per year (equalling
Gld1.50 per subscriber per channel), an amount which is five to six
times what Arcade pays to other cable operators. It is also much higher
than the amounts other broadcasters such as RTL4, Veronica and SBS6 are
paying A2000.

Arcade claims A2000 is misusing its monopoly and filed a complaint with
the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. It also began proceedings at
the Court of Amsterdam to force entrance to A2000. The Amsterdam judge
refused to rule as long as the proceedings at the Ministry are still
ongoing, but suggested the two parties to agree voluntary to a
temporary solution. The agreement between Arcade and A2000 calls for
monthly payments of Gld62,500 (#25,000) per channel until Arcade's
complaint at the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been resolved. Should
the ministry decide A2000's behaviour constitutes misuse of a monopoly,
the money will be restituted to Arcade.

SHAW, COGECO LAUNCH INTERNET SERVICES

Hot on the heels of Rogers Cablesystems' announcement of Wave, its
cable-modem PC access service, two more Canadian MSOs are dipping their
feet in the Internet. Shaw Communications has signed an agreement in
principle with Motorola for the purchase of 100,000 CyberSurfer cable
modems and Cogeco Cable has announced a partnership with St.Remy Press
Inc. for the development and marketing of a PC-based, mulitmedia
platform supporting a virtual shopping mall, to be run on its cable
network.

While Wave is now up and running, Shaw's access service is just
entering trials now and won't be launched until autumn. "We are looking
at some innovative concepts in packaging different tiers of services,"
said Brian Walters, Shaw's vice president for PC interactive services.
We are in the process of looking at the way we can nurture content
developers. At the end of the day we have to have an open platform so
that anyone who wants to, can be there."

Walters added that Shaw's basic Internet service will feature local
content, such as municipal services, entertainment and events tailored
to specific communities. Cogeco launched an Internet access service in
December and is in the process of rolling it out through its Quebec and
Ontario cable systems. It plans to test its virtual mall next spring,
for two months and then roll it out on a commercial basis. So far, all
of the announced cable provided PC access services are charging
somewhere in the C$35-$40 (#15-20) range, depending on whether or not
the modem is purchased or rented.

CANADA PLANS WORLD'S LARGEST MMDS SYSTEM

Manitoba-based Craig Broadcast Systems Inc. plans to become the world's
largest MMDS broadcaster in terms of geography. "It will be the largest
system in the world," said Stuart Craig, president and managing
director. "Nobody has ever tried this before. We will be broadcasting
from the Ontario to the Saskatchewan borders, east to west and from the
52 parallel to the American border, north to south."

In effect, Craig will be building a broadcast network that will
eventually cover more than half a million square kilometres with a
potential audience of slightly over one million.

"Manitoba is an ideal place for wireless cable with its flat terrain.
It's perfect for the delivery of signals and of course we have high
towers across the province which makes the project viable." Craig
Broadcast's wholly owned subsidiary SkyCable won the first licence
allocated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission, (CRTC) on December 20.

Craig has applied for an MMDS licence four times, beginning in 1983.
'The past applications were not successful because of CRTC decisions
and policies favouring cable." SkyCable's present business plans call
for investing C$26 million (#13m) to build nine transmission sites that
will reach 80% of Manitoba's population. Its initial target will be the
50,000 rural Manitobans who are outside cable areas. It will then
compete with existing cable companies in urban areas.

The addressable digital service will initially offer 40 channels of
programming including local, off the air stations, Canadian and
American networks and speciality channels, pay-per-view, pay TV, local
community channels and an educational channel and intends to upgrade to
60 channels.

Subscribers will pay a C$100 (#50) installation charge and a C$200
refundable deposit on the reception equipment. Antennas will vary in
size depending on the location of the nearest transmitter, ranging from
an 18 inch by 18 inch wire mesh receiver to a pencil-like antenna.

Subscription costs will be competitive with cable, starting with an
$18.95, 20 channel basic package and including three advanced tiers
ranging from $6.00 to $8.95. Craig's business plan calls for signing up
30,000 subscribers to be successful. He believes that compared to the
$1,000 plus costs of DTH systems, his MMDS network will prove
attractive to Manitobans.

HUGHES OPTS FOR SEA LAUNCH TO LOWER PRICES

Sea Launch, the first commercial satellite launching system to lift off
from an ocean-going platform has sold an initial series of ten launches
to Hughes Space and Communication Co, the Los Angeles-based satellite
manufacturer. It is the rocket consortium's first contract and the
financial details have not been released, although the contract's value
is believed to be in the $500 million (#325m) range.

Hughes' launches are scheduled to begin in 1998. Sea Launch Co is an
international joint venture with Boeing Commercial Space Co being the
lead partner with 40% of the equity, followed by Norwegian shipbuilder
the Kvaerner Group with 30%, Ukrainian rocket builder NPO Yuzhnoye with
15%, and Russian engine producer RSC Energia holding the remaining 25%.

The contract is seen as one of a series of moves by Hughes to 1ower the
price of commercial satellite launches by backing a number of different
launching systems. Large commercial satellite launches vary in cost
from $80 million (#52m) from reliable western providers, while Chinese
launches are believed to be in the $40 million (#26m) range. In the
past, Hughes has supported Chinese launch systems and recently gave a
ten launch contract to McDonnel Douglas Corp as an incentive to develop
a new rocket.

When asked if Hughes was attempting to lower the cost of launching
satellites, A spokesman for the Boeing space program replied, "If you
subscribe to the opinion, the more competition the better the price,
then I think that is the correct assumption. One of the goals of our
system is to be more cost effective and very competitive in price."

Sea Launch will be based in southern California. The Ukrainians will be
providing two stage Zenit rockets for the project while the Russians
will be supplying the upper stage or the rocket and other key systems.
The rockets will be assembled on a 650 foot (197)m long assembly and
command ship being built by the Kvaerner Group in Glasgow which is also
converting a 450 foot oil rig into a launch platform. Boeing is
supplying project management. The assembly and command ship will
probably be located in Long Beach, California and the launches will
take place in international waters in the Pacific.

CAPE BLAZE DASHES DSTV HOPES

MultiChoice's hopes of meeting early sales targets for its South
African digital DTH package, DSTV, have been dashed as a result of the
fire which destroyed the Cape Town factory producing Panasonic's MPEG-
2/DVB receivers in December, leaving the market totally dependent on
Pace.

The fire, apparently caused by an electrical fault, caused R30 million
(#5.31 million) worth of damage, destroying the production line from
which Panasonic was hoping to deliver 35,000 digital boxes before the
end of the year.

At the time of the fire, Panasonic had shipped only some "two to three
thousand" receivers, according to MultiChoice general manager marketing
Cobus Scholtz, who confirmed that the fire had "severely affected"
early roll-out targets for the 16-channel DTH service.

Soon after the fire, Panasonic said it hoped to restore production by
February. However, the full extent of the damage only became clear
later, and according to MultiChoice general manager, sales and
distribution, Deon Coetzee, Panasonic is now unlikely to be able to
supply any units until April, thus threatening prolonged shortages.
"Fortunately for us, Pace has come to the party rather nicely," he
said, "They're expected to supply 15,000 units in January and 10,000 in
February."

Hopes that Grundig might emerge as an alternative supplier had not
materialised, Coetzee added: "I understand they are still in talks with
Irdeto in Europe over the conditional access system." Grundig is
however expected to supply DVB IRDs for the consortium launching a
German language digital package for Africa. Meanwhile Echostar is
expected to bring its Star Walker approved DVB receivers into the
market, but not until March/April.

Despite the setbacks, Coetzee estimated sales since the DSTV launch in
November had totalled around 10,000 - "not too bad, considering." While
much of the momentum created by the first phase of marketing had been
wasted because there wasn't product to meet demand, he added, a "second
thrust" would be launched in late January, highlighting the latest
additions to the package: Discovery in early January, plus a local
Christian channel, Rhema; with EBN, Sci-Fi Channel, Bloomberg, Zee TV
and BET On Jazz to follow over the coming months.

EXPRESSVU, DIRECTV GET DTH LICENCES

On December 20, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission licensed Expressvu and Power DirecTv as authorised providers
of DTH services in Canada. It rejected a bid by Homestar, owned by a
cable consortium led by Canada's second largest MSO, Shaw
Communications.

Homestar's bid was rejected because the commission judged that it would
not be able to gain transponder space. Homestar intended to lease space
from Primestar, the American DTH operator owned by cable MSOs.
Primestar recently lost an orbital slot when the American Federal
Communications Commission took back the one it had intended to use to
launch a DBS satellite.

While DTH licences have now been granted, it is still uncertain as to
when operations will finally begin. Power DirecTv had asked the
commission to establish a cable tax on all cable subscribers to cover
its estimated C$17 million (#8.5m) in uplink costs. Without the tax,
Power DirecTv has said that it won't be able to turn a profit. Power
DirecTV is now considering its options and has declined to state what
it will do.

ExpressVu, which had originally been granted a licensing exemption in a
bid to kick-start cable competition is once again stalled in technical
problems with a glitch in its descrambling technology.

ExpressVu had originally been slated to launch last September but
failed to do so claiming at the time that the cable companies were
hogging transponder space. ExpressVu now believes that it will be in
service by the second quarter of 1996.

While the company has been unable to launch, it has been carrying on a
marketing program. "We are looking foreward to bringing a hundred plus
channels of digital audio and video services to places that have never
had that kind of service before," said Chris Franks, ExpressVu's vice
president of regulatory affairs.

'We are just working the last bugs out of our technology and we want to
come to the marketplace with a bullet proof operation. All the other
major DTH/DBS operations around the world have had significant delays.
I don't think we have lost any credibility. We have had over 10,000
calls on our 800 number."

The Commission's decision stated that within six months of the launch
of Canadian DTH services it would hear new applications for DTH
licences. Shaw has said that it will reapply at that time.

Meanwhile StarChoice, owned by Direct Choice of New Brunswick, has
already filed an application for a DTH licence. It plans to receive its
American signals from the just launched Echostar 1.

The company plans to use Echostar receiving equipment. Like Echostar
StarChoice plans to distribute through an established TVRC company,

ECHOSTAR LAUNCHES DBS, COMPETITION BEGINS

Echostar Communications Corp, successfully launched its high powered
DBS satellite Echostar 1 from China on December 28 and now hopes to be
in the marketplace by late February or early March.

Echostar plans to launch Echostar 2 from China during the summer. The
service will provide over 200 channels of digital video, audio and data
services and become America's second true DBS provider, after DirecTv.

While Primestar offers DTH services, it transmits from a medium powered
satellite restricting its receiving dishes to a now ungainly 30 inches
(76cm). AlphaStar, slated to start service during the first quarter of
1996, will also transmit from a medium powered satellite. True DBS
delivery systems use 18 inch receivers.

Echostar believes that it is in a strong position to compete with the
established American DTH and DBS providers. To begin with it has been
in the TVRO business as a hardware supplier since 1980 and has
operations in Holland, Spain, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia
and India. For the five years ending in 1994, the company captured 25%
of the over 2.1 million DTH units sold in the US.

"We have experience with DTH satellite products and dealers and we have
a very loyal existing base of TVRO dealers that will be our first
distribution path," said an Echostar spokesperson. "We also have the
most advanced technology. We are fully MPEG-2 compliant. DirecTv is
mostly MPEG-2 but in the area of communication between various pieces
of electronic equipment they are not. In addition DirecTv has two
sources of programming, DirecTv and USSB. If you want the full
compliment of cable programming you have to subscribe to both which
creates two bills and two cost centres. That gives us an advantage;
there will be a programming price difference."

While not yet ready to release its marketing or launch plans, Echostar
plans to come into the market at prices below other DBS/DTH providers.
Its prospectus states that the retail cost of an Echostar receiving
system will be in the $500 (#325) range, well below the cost entry
level costs of $700 (#455) for a DirecTV system.

Echostar will also be offering the system for direct sale, purchase
through financing and a leasing option. As far as subscription fees go,
the prospectus states that EchoStar intends to offer customised
packages of programming at prices below current cable and DBS/DTH
services.

"As far as the market goes," said Echostar, "we have seen numbers
anywhere from 12-20 million and we think it is at the high end of that
range. Certainly there is room for three to four players."

DUTCH INVITATION

Dutch junior minister of European Affairs Patijn has invited Belgium
public broadcaster BRTN to join the proposed pan-European Dutch
language satellite channel BVN - best of Dutch TV. Early last Summer
both Radio Nederland Wereldomroep (the Dutch world service radio) and
NOS simultaneously, but independent of each other, launched the idea of
a Dutch public satellite channel to reach the 600,000-odd Dutch living
abroad in Europe. So far, the plan has not materialised, mainly because
of difficulties in funding the project. With the possible co-operation
of the Flemish pubcaster, BVN might get off the ground in 1996.

AN UNCERTAIN LAW

Spain's cable law was finally passed by Parliament on December 15 and
came into effect On January 1. The law seems to satisfy no one, but
everybody agrees that it is much better to have a bad law than no
regulation at all, reports David Del Valle.

The Spanish cable law could have a short life if, as forecast, the
Conservative party (Partido Popular) comes to power in March and
overturns the legislation. Flying in the face of the law, PP is
insisting on putting cable TV cable licences out to tender within its
townships. Now the new law has come into effect there is some doubt
over the powers of the government to overturn licences already awarded
by regional and municipal authorities in PP-governed areas of Spain.

Besides PP's ardent opposition to the law, the Spanish cable bill has
failed to meet the demands of programmers, operators, political parties
and even the Government has voiced its opposition. The law was
introduced to fill a legal vacuum in the cable telecommunications
industry in Spain and to try to put the industry in order. All
political parties (PSOE, IU, CiU and PNV), except the conservatives,
reached a general consensus and decided, despite not being sure about
it, to approve a cable law. "The most important thing is there is a
law", said Miguel Puig, of CiU, who added that there are many things
which now need to be resolved on the technical side. Puig said the law
is too municipalist and is worried that networks awarded by townships
will give rise to "unadvanced networks dedicated only to television".

Puig agreed with programmers and operators that the law "fails to limit
the monopoly held by Telefonica and Canal Plus" and doesn't agree with
the limit of 2 million subscribed homes. The minister of Public Works
and Transport, Jose Borrell, also made his disagreement with this limit
clear and claimed "it will have constitutional problems because it
discriminates, as well as not corresponding with technological
reality". Borrell explained the need of having a cable law, however.
"We have bet on the future, not on the past. We think that this law
will allow the development of cable-based  multi-media services and
broadband networks. If a law had been passed three years ago, it would
have been obsolete by now and wouldn't have been able to meet the
current demands". He attacked PP's move to award cable licences and
calls on the party to "abandon hasty initiatives which are outside the
law, only satisfy political opportunism and which could endanger
investment in and the future of cable". He added, "we will challenge
PP's licence allocations if we consider that they exceed municipal
authority and invade ours (state authority) and if licences are awarded
not just for television, but also telecommunication services."

The Government is to create a regulatory authority responsible for
solving problems and conflicts between programmers and cable operators
which would be composed of administration, operators and programmers.

The president of Telefonica, Candido Velazquez claimed his network will
be "open to any programmers, besides Cablevision (Canal Plus). We will
be in cable wherever possible and we have approached Antena 3, Prensa
Espanola, Grupo Moll and many others". Velazquez, who assured that
"Cablevision will be operating under the same conditions as others"
considers the period of nine months which Telefonica will have to wait
before starting operations as "too long for those who want to have
cable television as soon as possible". In cities where the private
operator has no licence, Telefonica and Canal Plus will have to delay
their plans until their competitor has the correct authorisation.

Programmers, for their part, are also very critical. Eugenlo Galdon,
president of Multitel, the company which recently joined with ABC and
UIH to exploit cable in Spain and Portugal, claimed that this
"conservative" law "benefits Telefonica and Canal Plus, which both have
the monopoly of telephony and pay TV, respectively, in Spain". For him,
"it is very worrying that this law comes to light without the support
of one of the main political parties (Partido Popular)".  Galdon
criticised the limits of each demarcation (50,000 minimum and 2 million
as maximum subscribers). In his opinion, this law gives a lot of
privileges to Telefonica, because it will be able to offer both
telephony and television services, while private operators will be able
to offer only television. "This doesn't promote competition", he
concluded. According to his forecasts, two different scenarios could
take place between years 2000 and 2010 regarding cable penetration and
telephony shares in the hands of cable companies. The first one, which
he described as a good and acceptable situation, indicates, according
to his figures, that in the year 2000 cable penetration might be 20%
and in 2010, around 60%. In this situation, by the year 2000 cable
companies would manage 3% of telephony and in 2010, 20%. The second
one, a failure situation, in 2000 cable penetration would be around 10%
and in 2010, 35%. Regarding telephony, it would be 6%.

Terrestrial channel Antena 3, which has just launched five digital
Channels on Hispasat through a new company called Cable Antena, is very
unhappy with this law and has accused the Government of favouring Canal
Plus. "This law discriminates against programmers in favour of Canal
Plus", complained Manuel Campo Vidal, vice president of Antena 3. He
criticised Telefonica for joining up with Canal Plus which, according
to him, "will act as a gatekeeper which everyone, who wants to offer
his programmes through Telefonica's networks, will have to pass groups
all autonomous channels), Jordi Vila, claims that "our intention is to
be on satellite and there are four televisions (TV3, Canal Sur, ETB and
TVG) interested in it. We will form national or international alliances
to compete".

He also cast doubt on Telefonica's claim that it will have its network
open to everyone. "Canal Plus will determine the encryption system, fix
prices and determine where each channel goes. "Free access to
Telefonica's network is vital, as otherwise the development of cable
will be stopped."

Juan Luis Cebrian, member of the Canal Plus board, replied that 'this
law doesn't have any effect on the agreement between Canal Plus and
Telefonica" and justified the alliance on the need of making huge joint-
ventures to exploit cable.  He added, "according to our forecasts, we
won't make any profit on cable until within 10 years". He made it clear
that pay TV will only mean between 8 and 10% of turnover on cable, with
telephony services the most profitable. Cebrian denied that Cablevision
will act as a gatekeeper and fix prices".

Meanwhile, Cablevision continues its expansion throughout Spain - 16
cities already receive its 41 channels. Subscription to Cablevision
available from the end of the month will cost Pst 2,675 and Pst 6208 if
the subscriber also wants Canal Plus. In Barcelona, Cablevision has
already 2,600 homes connected out of a potential 12,000 homes.

year olds.

2% in 1994 to 4.5% in 1995. This share reaches 30.5% among 2 to 9 year
olds.

DUTCH AD SPEND

For the first time in history spending on TV advertising on Dutch
channels surpassed the one billion guilder mark (#400m). Public
broadcasters are not the beneficiaries of the extra money spent on
commercials - the share of Ster went down from 50% to 35%, while IP
went up top 60%. SBS 6 is expected to take in between 3 and 5%. In real
terms, Ster's 1995 income is down 30 million guilders to 455 million.
IP's income is up to 555 million, mainly because of the arrival of
Veronica as a commercial channel. SBS 6 will take in around 20 million,
while other channels, including Euro 7, Kindernet and local cable
channels will grab 40 million.

PEARSON TUMBLES

its1995 pretax profit would easily exceed that of previous years,
largely due to proceeds from the September sale of its 9.75% stake in
