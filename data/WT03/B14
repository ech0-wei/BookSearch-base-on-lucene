PLAYING FOLLOW THE LEADER
IN OSS

By:
Gayle Gaddis

Today's operations support systems vendors need a role model. Those vendors
who have taken the largest share of the OSS market in the past--most of
them network equipment vendors like AT&T, Bellcore, Nortel, Siemens,
Ericsson, and Alcatel--have suddenly found themselves in a changed OSS
market, one that values service over technology, one that expects
guarantees, and one that does not need to be told what its needs are. For
these traditional vendors--many of whom still believe that providing the
technology is the same as providing service--a new market strategy must be
found. They could develop this new strategy on their own, but that would be
reinventing the wheel; Andersen Consulting (along with some smaller
independent network management vendors) has already begun to set the
paradigm that OSS vendors will need to follow into the year 2000.
Certainly it would seem that Andersen, which has entered the telecom market
through the side door (i.e., business consulting), would have little to
teach AT&T, which practically founded the U.S. telecom market and has the
largest installed base of operations support systems to date. Yet AT&T,
like some of its fellow manufacturers, still suffers from an
equipment-based mentality that does not encompass service arrangements like
risk-sharing or joint marketing with customers. Andersen, on the other
hand, has pioneered some of these arrangements for OSS. Vendors like AT&T
also suffer (although AT&T less than some other OSS vendors) from an
attachment to the concept of management systems, rather than frameworks.
Alcatel still wants to sell the customer a box, where newer software
companies and integrators like OSI and TCSI want to sell the customer a
foundation upon which applications can be built (and thus are not selling
the customer any applications it does not need). Essentially, the OSS
market is moving in directions dictated by customers, and no longer by
vendors. And now that AT&T et al. can no longer tell customers what they
should need for OSS, they would do well to follow the lead of
customer-driven players like Andersen.

Changing the Rules
It is the OSS customers themselves--the local and global service providers,
whether wireline, wireless, or cable--that have instigated the
transformation of OSS, by beginning to demand the same types of guarantees
on performance and delivery from their vendors that end customers are
demanding from them. Until only a year or two ago, most telecom
carriers--and particularly wireline carriers, many of whom already had
years of engineering expertise upon which to rely--did a substantial amount
of their OSS development or customization in-house, thus reducing the need
for vendors to be concerned with customized approaches to OSS. Recently,
however, most of these carriers doing substantial portions of OSS work
internally have begun seeking outside sources, not only for systems, but
for customized applications. BellSouth, for instance, is now in transition
from having done 90% of OSS work internally to doing only 60% internally
and 40% on a contracted basis. With the drive to improve bottom lines,
carriers are seeking outside solutions in order to reduce the cost of OSS
development on the books. Given this fact, carriers are very sensitive to
cost issues for OSS, and price has become one of the key points on which
carriers are demanding guarantees, especially in light of the hidden costs
that had become a frequent occurrence as OSS contracts became more
complex.
   BT, for instance, found out first-hand that certain vendors would rather
tell the customer what it wants to hear about time and cost than risk
losing business by giving an accurate, if costly, estimate. BT purchased
products with the understanding that they represented a full, end-to-end
OSS solution, only to hear later from the vendor that additional equipment
or software would be required, thus adding both cost and time to the
implementation. Ultimately, the vendor lost business by telling the
customer what it wanted to hear, and increasingly, all OSS vendors with
this mentality will similarly be losing key clients. Stentor faced similar
situations with vendors, specifically with vendors who began to neglect
customer service once they had established a strong, embedded position in
the market (again, traditional manufacturers like AT&T and Bellcore, and
computing vendors like IBM and Digital are the chief culprits). As a
result, Stentor is now in the process of introducing supplier
reviews--which it characterizes as like a report card--to keep vendors on
their toes and let them know when service is beginning to slip. Such
stringent attention to service, cost, and time commitments will become the
norm as the decade wears on. Carriers today have had to become far too
service-conscious and technology-savvy in their own customer contracts to
simply accept what they are given by vendors.

Setting an Example
In order to meet these newly stringent requirements, OSS vendors must
significantly change the ways in which they do business, devising specific
schemes by means of which they can provide customized service and
guarantees to customers without compromising their own economies of scale
or their bottom lines. One such scheme is risk-sharing, which can take
different forms but nearly always results in increased customer
satisfaction. One form might simply involve project time-tables. If the
vendor completes the project (satisfactorily, of course) earlier than the
agreed-upon date, it receives a bonus. Completing the project later than
the agreed-upon date results in a penalty. GTE is beginning to require such
agreements with its OSS vendors, with an eye to the strict timetables under
which it plans to complete its business process re-engineering. Another
version of risk-sharing can result in a bigger payback for both carrier and
vendor alike, but also involves greater risk--that of joint development and
joint marketing of an OSS product or platform. It is in this latter form
that Andersen has taken a lead and provides a strong example for vendors
that are grappling with ways to both increase customer service and stay
lean in the OSS market.
   Co-development and marketing of a product not only allows customers more
control over the OSS development process at a point at which they would
otherwise feel control was being lost (with the cuts in funds for internal
development), it also increases customers' trust in the vendor. Under other
circumstances, the vendor has a perfect opportunity to resell an
application developed for a specific customer many times over. This makes
use of the customer's specs and expertise, but cuts the customer out of the
additional profits. While a great way for vendors to create economies of
scale, it has angered some customers. Because Andersen works so closely
with customers, however, getting to know their business organizations
intimately, it has recognized hot buttons like these, and hence has
capitalized on strategies (like risk-sharing) which avoid them. Andersen
has a steadily growing list of cost- and profit-sharing agreements with
high-profile carriers: Pacific Bell, Bell Atlantic, and BellSouth among
them (Andersen in fact does business with all the U.S. RBOCs; BellSouth was
the last holdout).
   Similarly, smaller, independent vendors of OSS software and services
have something to teach the traditional vendors as well. By necessity these
providers have a strong customer service ethic like that of Andersen, only
on a smaller scale. When one large carrier makes up a full 10%-20% of the
customer base--as is the case with some smaller vendors--clearly everything
possible must be done to keep that customer happy. These small vendors
offer another lesson as well to vendors like Siemens or Alcatel: how to
build economies of scale in an increasingly customized OSS market. The
answer is in the development of management frameworks, rather than the
traditional boxes that these more established vendors are accustomed to
selling.
   OSI, for instance, a vendor which is just beginning to make a name for
itself in OSS, has already begun to capture a significant portion of the
emerging market for wireless OSS. This is not because it built a system
specific to the management of wireless networks, but because it built a
platform on which wireless management applications could be built, as could
applications for legacy integration on wireline networks, or applications
for emerging network technologies, like AIN (OSI's NetExpert platform has
in fact been used for several AIN implementations already). To address the
same variety of applications, Ericsson would require that a customer
implement several different versions of the same system, and some other
vendors might require multiple different systems and still not be able to
address emerging applications such as PCS or AIN. (AT&T's ability to do
this particular OSS juggling act is still in question; the slow progress of
its OneVision platform suggests that this capability may be down the
road.)

At a Standstill?
While Andersen, OSI, and a few other vendors have taken these steps toward
increasing customer involvement and satisfaction, they constitute a
minority in doing so. Exhibit 1 illustrates the position of various OSS
vendors vis vis increased levels of customer service and willingness to
partner with the customer through risk-sharing arrangements (i.e., the
willingness to actually put their money where their mouths are, rather than
simply calling any contract a "partnership"). The cluster of vendors
scoring low on both fronts should question their long-term viability in the
OSS market; there is no doubt that their customers are. And long-term
viability is nearly as important to OSS customers as customer service
itself. These vendors should take their cues from players like Andersen,
which itself will undoubtedly be in the market for a very long time.

CELLULAR DATA ...READY TO TAKE OFF AT LAST?

By:
Mirva Anttila

The wireless data market has not taken off as quickly as many industry
experts predicted. The rapid growth of cellular voice subscribership to
date has not led to a similar expansion of cellular data usage.
   Cellular data users (both circuit- and packet-switched) represent a
small portion of total cellular voice subscribership. Despite anticipated
growth over the next few years, cellular data users will remain a small
subset of the larger cellular voice subscriber population (see Exhibit 2).
Reasons for slower-than-expected development of cellular data are numerous:
the existence of multiple wireless data platforms (making it difficult and
confusing for customers to choose the right one); the unreliability of
circuit-switched data transmission; lack of standards for Cellular Digital
Packet Data (CDPD) software development; non-ubiquitous data network
coverage; clumsy, heavy end-user devices (some with no communications
capability and some with awkward handwriting recognition technologies);
incompatible modems; high-priced service; and a lack of cooperation in the
industry.
   Moreover, cellular data service differs greatly from cellular voice, and
the two services simply cannot be promoted in the same manner. The sales
cycle for wireless data solutions is much longer than the sales cycle for
voice users. Most of today's data users are corporations that must
cost-justify expensive new technology, with the result that the technology
must live up to its promise. At the same time, both users and cellular data
salespeople must be educated about the need for, and utility of, cellular
data solutions.

What Cellular Data Users Need To Know
The following items are the minimum requirements for cellular data users:
  -- Ubiquity of Service: Interconnect to wireline tele-phone networks or
to (other) packet-switched networks; use with a variety of termin-als;
adaptability to current in-house protocols (systems).
  -- Coverage: In-building capabilities.
  -- Portability: Small, light-weight terminals; reasonable battery life.
  -- Features: Voice backup; privacy and security; wide range of data
capabilities and applications.
  -- Price: Low pricing for ser-vices and terminals.
  -- Circuit-switched Data Problems and Solutions
Having been created for voice communications, analog cellular networks are
vulnerable to interference that causes fading and breakup, and that can
result in dropped calls. For voice communications this is irritating, but
for data communications these problems are fatal since the signal may
become so corrupted by interference that some information is lost. The
success rate on each data transfer attempt is estimated to be only about
55-60%, and if the user moves during a data call, normal circuit-switched
data transfer will be disrupted. Digital signals convert the analog wave
form into a numerical code (1 or 0) and are therefore more resistant to
errors. When signal corruption does occur, error-correction logic at the
receiving end can often reconstruct the corrupted signal. The digital
environment also allows the use of processing techniques that improve
signal strength without requiring any increase in power, so signals can be
transmitted over longer distances.
   To improve the success ratio, circuit-switched data transmission
cellular carriers have begun to install modem pools at mobile switching
centers in major metropolitan markets, thereby increasing the reliability
and transmission speed of circuit-switched data service. This development
enables cellular users with dissimilar modems to exchange data at speeds
comparable to landline rates.
   Operators are also introducing new pricing approaches. To date,
operators have been pricing circuit-switched data transmission in
one-minute increments (like cellular voice). However, this tariff structure
is not economical for users sending large numbers of short messages that
are less than one minute in duration. So operators are exploring the
possibility of offering specialized pricing packages for circuit-switched
cellular data. For example, Cellular One in Buffalo (an AT&T
Wireless/Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems joint venture) introduced a
separate pricing plan for cellular data. The "Data Gateway" service is
available for $4.95/month plus airtime fees: $0.15/minute during peak times
and $0.03/minute during off-peak hours. The network uses modem pool
technology developed by Primary Access Corp. that can differentiate between
voice and data calls for the purpose of separate billing.

CDPD Problems and Solutions
It's now widely recognized that technology developers are often prone to
overlook the marketing aspects of new services rollout and behave as if the
mere existence of a new product or technology is all that is required to
ensure market demand. A few years ago, CDPD was widely heralded as the
"next big thing" in wireless. However, as has been the case with other
heavily hyped new telecom technologies, the market has not developed yet.
Thus far, the primary barriers to the spread of CDPD services have been the
lack of ubiquitous network coverage and the lack of standards for wireless
data applications development. Recently, however, cellular carriers have
gotten the message and have begun to implement solutions.

Ubiquitous Network Coverage
CDPD had been commercially deployed in 41 U.S. markets by October 1995.
This translates to approximately 14% penetration in the country's 306
Metropolitan Statistical Areas. As illustrated in Exhibit 3, five of the
top nine U.S. cellular carriers have deployed CDPD. Nevertheless, the
establishment of an effective nationwide CDPD "network" has proceeded
slowly. To date, only two interoperability or "visiting" agreements have
been formed among the carriers. In mid-1995, GTE Mobilnet and Ameritech
Cellular entered into an agreement to provide CDPD service in each other's
markets, initially covering Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Houston, and San
Francisco. In late 1995, GTE Mobilnet and Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile (BANM)
concluded a similar agreement including all of GTE's metropolitan markets
and BANM's Connecticut market. BANM plans to expand its area in 1996,
pending regulatory approval. Under these agreements, each company retains
its own tariff structure but customers receive only one bill from their
home service provider. Before seamless nationwide network coverage can be
achieved, however, the cellular operators must coordinate their CDPD
billing and accounting efforts. Several operators forecast that 1996 will
be a big year for interoperability agreements and that a nationwide CDPD
network could be in place in late 1996 or early 1997.
   Most operators agree that it is vitally important for the carriers to
work together to create seamless nationwide data coverage instead of
fighting against each other. Nevertheless, several of the largest cellular
carriers--AirTouch Communications, BellSouth Cellular, Southwestern Bell
Mobile Systems (SBMS), and U S West--are not "sold" on CDPD. Most cite lack
of market demand as the major reason for not deploying CDPD. Some are also
not convinced that CDPD will ever be the packet data technology choice for
them. AirTouch and U S West, both deploying CDMA in their cellular
networks, are exploring CDMA's data transmission capabilities. Similarly,
BellSouth and SBMS are reviewing packet data options using TDMA, their
chosen digital cellular standard. Moreover, BellSouth has an ownership
stake in RAM Mobile Data, which provides wireless packet data services on a
Mobitex-standard network, and views CDPD as a competing technology.
   Lack of Standards for Wireless Data Applications Development
In the short term, the success of wireless data depends on the software
developers' ability to create applications that satisfy customers' needs.
Circuit-switched data technology allows the modification of wireline
applications fairly easily, but CDPD currently lacks the software standards
that would encourage developers to create programs. A major industry
problem is that most software applications are specifically created for
certain wireless data platforms. Consequently, some customers are afraid
that once they sign up for certain CDPD applications, they will be stuck
with them (and who knows if CDPD is going to be around in five years).
Wireless data applications today can be divided into vertical (industry
specific, database/host connectivity), horizontal (messaging, fax,
information/news services, file transfer, Internet backbone
communications), and networking (desktop, LAN, and database access). Most
of today's CDPD solutions are specialized applications for vertical
markets, but the demand for horizontal applications is growing.
   One solution to the software problem may be the emergence of middleware,
a software engine that allows data applications to run on multiple, diverse
networks. Middleware bridges surface incompatibilities between different
mobile technologies that all have different protocols. Middleware also
fosters cooperation by allowing multiple applications to run concurrently.
   Some middleware solutions are broadly oriented toward creating fully
open-system telecom platforms with a common application programming
interface; others simply enable land-line applications over wireless or
target multi-platform applications for specific activities like electronic
commerce. Middleware is also helpful for networks employing the same
protocol. It can be used to provide sign-in scripts that suit different
types of CDPD modems. Most wireless data carriers support the middleware
concept because it encourages applications development and gets more
customers into the wireless data mode. In the future, middleware functions
are likely to be integrated into network protocols as carriers realize the
importance of allowing customers to access multiple networks.

End-user Device Problems and Solutions
User-friendly hardware is as important as service reliability, ubiquitous
coverage, and reasonably priced service. The cellular data market will
develop hand-in-hand with the growth of the notebook/laptop computer
market. Some of these products have been streamlined and simplified during
the last few years. Instead of using external modems and interfaces, many
notebook computers today employ Personal Computer Memory Card International
Association (PCMCIA) modems. The cellular phone is connected to this
credit-card sized modem via a slim cable and quick-release data cradle that
holds the phone during data transmission. In the future, the cellular radio
chip-set may even be incorporated into the PCMCIA modem card. Another way
to integrate the cellular data device and the radio is to design products
like IBM's PC Radio, which has an RF data unit comprising a cellular radio,
modem, and antenna.
   One of the first attempts to combine computing and communications
functions was the introduction of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) in
spring 1993. The early PDAs, such as Apple's "Newton Message Pad,"
EO/AT&T's "EO-Personal Communicator," Tandy's "Zoomer," and Motorola's
"Envoy," had the form factor of a handheld computer. The products were not
successful due to premature launching. Early end-user device developers and
promoters made many mistakes with the technology, overhyped the industry,
set unrealistic expectations, and targeted the wrong market (the consumer
instead of the business market). Many of these mistakes were typical of the
early stages of high-tech product development.
   Most early PDAs were too awkward to use, too bulky and too heavy to
carry around, and too expensive. They were like sophisticated electronic
organizers with limited communications features, primarily allowing users
to write notes, keep appointment calendars, and maintain telephone/address
lists. In some cases, users could send and receive wireline and wireless
e-mail and faxes with optional modems and cellular phones, but the devices
did not provide wireless connectivity as a standard feature. The problem
with these early PDAs was that they were not designed for communications
and both end-user devices and applications were computing- and
data-centric. Some of the new products (to be introduced in 1996), such as
Compaq Computer's "WinPad," still concentrate on the computer form factor
and emphasize the backward compatibility with corporate desktops.
   One step in the right direction was the introduction of a cellular
phone-type device. In late 1994, BellSouth rolled out "Simon," a product
combining voice and data functionality. However, Simon was still too
awkward to use, relied on inadequate handwriting recognition, lacked a
clear screen display, and had insufficient battery capacity.
   Motorola's newest versions of "Envoy" and "Marco," and PCSI's new
prototype "PAL," can also be included in this category of
communications-centric devices. In late 1995, Air Communications Inc.
introduced an "AirCommunicator" device that combines cellular voice, data
messaging, and fax functionalities. Several operators, including AirTouch
Communications, Ameritech Cellular, Sprint Cellular, and U S West Cellular,
decided to bundle their analog cellular services with this multi-function
communicator. For the cellular data market to take off significantly,
additional voice-centric devices, more appropriate for the largely untapped
mobile executive market, must be available.

Systems Integrators to the Rescue?
To expand usage of cellular data services, carriers can increase network
coverage, introduce additional features, support the development of
user-friendly devices, and intensify their marketing efforts to better
reach the target business user market. However, the carriers cannot do this
alone. Cellular operators will rely increasingly on systems integrators to
provide a complete service solution. Systems integrators will package the
various elements: the cellular data service, the communications device
(cellular phone, cellular/radio modem, pager, etc.), communications
"middleware" (interfaces computing environment to communications
environment), applications software (horizontal, vertical, networking), and
central processing unit (CPU). To ensure the widest possible distribution
for wireless data solutions, systems integrators have certified resellers
who in turn sell the solution to the marketplace. Unlike cellular voice
service (which appears to "sell itself"), cellular data service,
particularly CDPD, requires more coordinated efforts on the part of
hardware and applications developers, distribution agents, and the cellular
operators themselves.

CREATIVE DESTRUCTION IN GLOBAL PUBLIC NETWORKS

By:
Michael Arellano, Vern Mackall, and Courtney Munroe

The title of this article is taken from Josef Schumpeter, a 19th Century
economist who said that entrepreneurs create "new combinations" that can
rapidly create wealth for risk-takers and, in the process, undermine the
position of established competitors. Overall, economic activity increases
and wealth is created, but competitors who cannot adapt fast enough will
see their assets decline markedly in value: hence, "creative destruction"
or "productive chaos."
   These phrases are apt descriptions of today's global public network
market in the sense that established and emerging carriers, in the U.S. and
globally, seek to expand their current service portfolios to provide voice
(both local and long distance), video, high-speed data, home shopping and
banking, and other types of communications services. As operators seek to
enter new markets and protect their positions in their existing markets,
old ways of doing business, as well as the infrastructure used to deliver
services, will undergo radical transformation.
   Given regulatory changes and technological development, stable
monopolies and guaranteed market share are things of the past.

U.S. Local Services Market
In the U.S. market, the long-awaited reform of the telecommunications
industry appears increasingly close to reality. As a result, telecom
operators can become "one-stop shops," offering customers several different
types of services, provided they can raise the capital for the necessary
network upgrades.
   Exhibit 4 illustrates what is at stake in terms of revenue. Although the
pie is getting bigger, competition means that the current size of each type
of operator's slice is not guaranteed. Exhibits 5 and 6 show the same set
of services by carrier group market share in 1995 and 2000, respectively.
Local exchange carriers (LECs) provide local phone service (the first four
rows); interexchange carriers (IXCs) offer long distance service;
Competitive Access Providers (CAPs) also offer local service; and Multiple
System Operators (MSOs) are large cable TV operators.
   These carriers currently operate primarily within their own well-defined
markets, but distinctions between the different carrier groups will become
less meaningful following the implementation of telecom reform. Indeed,
combinations between operators from different groups are inevitable. The
IXCs will compete in the local access market by offering local loop and
wireless bypass solutions. The LECs will lose billions of dollars as IXCs
target business markets with private line alternatives and, eventually,
provide switched access for both wired and wireless communications.
   In the residential market, LECs will continue to lose market share in
the toll call segment to IXCs. Pacific Bell, which already faces
competition in the toll call segment, has experienced revenue declines in
this area as new rivals exert pricing pressure. The same pattern will no
doubt be repeated in the other Local Access Transport Areas (LATAs).

International Service Markets
A similar transformation will take place in international markets. Exhibit
7 presents global telecom service revenues and shows that wired voice and
data services, the "bread and butter" markets of incumbent operators
(PTTs), will represent the major source of revenue over the next five
years. However, many incumbent national operators' markets are being
transformed by liberalization, modernization, and competition. Other
Licensed Operators (OLCs) such as Mercury in the United Kingdom and Optus
in Australia, as well as Global Carriers (GCs) such as Concert (MCI and BT)
and WorldPartners (AT&T and other carriers), are challenging the economics
and cost structure of the traditional monopoly telecom operator.
   Exhibits 8 and 9 illustrate each carrier group's share of the different
telecom service segments in 1995 and 2000, indicating that as
liberalization and competition proceed worldwide global carriers and other
licensed operators will make substantial gains at the expense of the
traditional PTTs. As a result, incumbent operators are preparing their
strategic responses, which include privatization (both to augment financial
resources and to increase managerial flexibility), new business practices,
introduction of new services, and entry into new lines of business. Some
incumbent operators are also positioning themselves as global carriers. For
example, Deutsche Telekom is gearing up for competition in Germany while
working with France Telecom and Sprint as part of the Phoenix global
carrier alliance. Incumbent operators such Deutsche Telekom and France
Telecom will rapidly lose wired voice and data market share to the
competition, and will lose it much faster than AT&T did in the United
States. The global competitors have the advantage of greater experience and
agility in scaling national boundaries, while other licensed competitors
will have the advantage of newer, state-of-the-art networks.
   Service operators' responses to loss of market share and management of
potential new opportunities will be key to their success and survival. The
main issue is for carriers to move from high-cost/low-revenue sectors to
high-margin sectors. This will vary depending on market sector and
position. New entrants must target the low-cost, high-revenue customers.
Incumbent operators whose monopolies are being attacked must, at a minimum,
ensure that their service tariffs match their cost structures. Operators in
markets that are already competitive must understand potential entrants'
cost structures and increase their service differentiation and price
competition efforts. For new entrants in all types of markets, the name of
the game is "cream skimming," at least in the early days. The creative
destruction wrought by telecom reform, market liberalization, and
competition will result in short- to medium-term turmoil, with many new
players. In the end, however, we could see a case of "deja vu all over
again," with "supercarriers" providing all types of services to all
customers.

E-MAIL TAP HELPS CLOSE CELLULAR FRAUD RING

Federal authorities, relying on the first-ever court-
approved wiretap of e-mail accounts, arrested and charged three
people with running one of the most sophisticated cellular fraud
rings uncovered so far.

Equipment seized by authorities included a cellular phone
that can eavesdrop on calls placed by other cellular phone users;
a small, easily-concealed device that steals legitimate users'
phone numbers by plucking them off the airwaves; and several
phones that could be programmed with up to 99 stolen numbers via
the phones' keypads, instead of using a separate personal
computer.

The high-tech nature of the gadgets underscores the growing
sophistication of cellular phone crimes. The wireless industry
says it loses about $500 million in revenue each year to thieves,
but independent observers estimate the loss is closer to $1
billion. With the boom in wireless services expected to continue
into the next decade, current crimes are adding urgency to the
industry's effort to crack down on fraud.

The three people arrested were charged with fraud relating
to access devices and conspiracy. One also was charged with money
laundering. -- The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, p. 16, "U.S.,
Using E-Mail Tap, Charges Three With Operating Cellular-Fraud
Ring"

FTC TELEMARKETING RULES TAKE EFFECT

Telemarketers who call consumers back after being told just
once not to call again can now face legal action under federal
rules that went into effect on Dec. 31, 1995. They are aimed at
cracking down on abusive sales practices.

The FTC said the rules were designed to give consumers an
easy-to-use toll to halt unwanted calls.

All consumers have to do to stop a telemarketer from calling
is simply ask the caller not to phone them again. If the firm
does call again, it is breaking the law and consumers should
report it to their state attorney general's office for action,
said the FTC.

The telemarketing sales rules also bar telemarketers from
calling consumers before 8 a.m. and after 9 p.m. When they do
call, telemarketers must tell the consumer that they are trying
to sell something before making the pitch.

Then, before consumers pay, the telemarketer must state the
total cost of the product or service they are offering and any
restrictions on getting or using them.

The rules also ban misrepresentations, tightly restrict the
telemarketing of credit repair services, and make it unlawful for
any company or individual to assist fraudulent telemarketing
behind the scenes. -- The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, p. 6, "FTC
Rules to Curb Telemarketing Abuse Took Effect Sunday"

FLA. IPP PROVIDERS RECEIVE QUARTERLY UPDATES

As of Jan. 1, 1996, IPP providers in Florida began receiving
quarterly notification from LECs of all NXX activity occurring
under the Land-to-Mobile (LTM) option.

The LTM option allows intraLATA direct-dialed long distance
calls to be treated as local for landline customers placing calls
to mobile numbers throughout an entire LATA. Calls that would
normally be billed as toll to the end user are reverse-billed by
the LEC to the mobile service provider on a usage-sensitive
basis. -- Perspectives, December, p. 37

UK RULING TO PROMOTE COMPETITION

Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission demolished a
barrier to increased competition in the U.K. telecom market when
it ruled that customers would be able to retain their phone
numbers when changing operators.

The decision sent a signal to British Telecom that
commission broadly supports the measures that promote
competition.

The MMC ruling settled a dispute between BT and the
regulator setting out a framework for how the costs of number
portability should be split between rival companies.

It said BT should bear 70% of the costs against 30% for the
new operator over the next five years. -- The Financial Times,
Dec. 15, p. 8, "Phone number ruling boosts for telecom
competition"

MCI VIDEOPHONE USES TVS, PHONE LINES

MCI's VideoPhone enables consumers to convert their TVs into
telephones.

The VideoPhone is designed as a set-top box connected to the
television and phone line. Using data compression techniques, the
MCI product transports audio and video signals across the country
via regular phone lines, for the same cost as a regular long
distance call.

Customers can select the screen size, operate the unit by
remote control; select from a variety of on-screen commands; hold
videoconferences with multiple callers; and record conversations
onto VHS tape.

MCI estimates the VideoPhone will be on the market by June
1996 and will retail for approximately $1,300. The company also
intends to offer leasing options. -- Communications Industries
Report, December, p. 12, "MCI Videophone Uses TVs & Standard
Phone Lines"

NEWBRIDGE HELPS TELCOS PROFIT FROM THE NET

Newbridge Networks, a supplier of broadband switches to
public network carriers, unveiled a line of products to enable
service providers to offer Internet access easily and to beef up
their backbone networks to handle the explosion in Internet
traffic.

The approach includes both access and backbone products, as
well as a single network management system designed to let
service providers easily operate their networks from a
centralized, remote location. The new product family builds on
existing Newbridge products, notably asynchronous transfer mode
(ATM) switches, and adds new Internet access products.

Newbridge is aiming its Internet products at telephone
companies, Internet service providers and private corporations,
but will likely start with the phone companies that have already
started buying the Newbridge ATM switch line. -- Interactive
Week, Dec. 18, p. 20, "Newbridge Helps Phone Firms Capitalize on
Net"

PAGERS AREN'T JUST FOR MESSAGES

Data Critical Corp., an Oklahoma City company developing
ways to transmit urgent data over pagers, is developing a method
to let hospitals send electrocardiograms, via pager, to mobile
cardiologists. The cost is $25,000 to set up a system serving
five doctors, and Hewlett-Packard sells the hardware.

The Data Critical system consists of HP personal computers
situated in emergency rooms, loaded with the right software to
compress the data files, encrypt them, then transmit these to a
pager network. The other end of the system is equivalent to a
standard belt-mounted pager equipped with a connector link for an
HP 200 LX, a palm-top computer. The pager receives the data file
wherever the cardiologist is and feeds it into the tiny computer.
The computer decompresses the data and displays the EKG on a
high-resolution screen.

Data Critical is moving on to other applications. FBI agents
are experimenting with the gear. And more developments are made
possible by PCS (personal communications system) paging
frequencies auctioned off by the federal government last year.
PCS uses two-way transmissions, making possible brief responses
and acknowledgments. -- Forbes Magazine, Jan. 1, "Pagers aren't
just for messages to call the office. You can practice medicine
or trade stocks with them"

INTERNET GROWTH HIGH IN '95

If brilliant realizations really did appear as light bulbs
flashing above people's heads, 1995 would have been an especially
bright year for the information and telecom industry. Company
after company came to understand that their futures were at least
partly linked to the Internet.

Microsoft announced that it was redefining itself an
Internet company. AT&T declared that it, too, wanted to be an
Internet company. IBM announced an ambitious Internet strategy.
And America Online set a new course for the Internet.

The awakening of the information and telecom giants means
that even the most nimble of the Internet companies will have to
be careful to avoid being trampled as the rush to cyberspace
intensifies this year.

While companies like Netcom and PSINet, which recognized the
potential of Internet access before most others, have earned the
right to compete with AT&T and MCI, hundreds of smaller Internet
services providers are looking for new partners, new markets or
new jobs. This is in part because of the expected competition
from telephone and cable companies.   -- New York Times, Jan. 2,
p. C14, "Rough-and-Ready Time in the Internet Business"

Pressler Says Telecom Vote May Not Occur Until March;
Nine of 11 Senate Conferees Likely Will Sign Report

          Although a quick resolution of the federal budget impasse
could pave the way for congressional consideration of pending
telecommunications legislation as early as this week, industry
observers are betting that final votes likely will be taken later
this month or in late February.  House and Senate lawmakers could
consider a telecom legislative compromise shortly after they
return to Washington for President Clinton's State of the Union
address, tentatively scheduled for Jan. 23.  If that window of
opportunity is missed, Congress may not consider the measure
until after the Feb. 20 presidential primary in New Hampshire.

          HIGHLIGHTS:  Pressler plans to introduce foreign ownership
measure soon...Conferees clarify facilities-based competition
requirement for Bell company market entry...Conference agreement
will not supersede antitrust consent decrees...Rural advocates
concerned about effect of geographic rate averaging language on
business services...Draft calls for "explicit" universal service
support mechanism.

          Sen. Larry Pressler (R., S.D.), Chairman of the telecom
conference committee, acknowledged last Friday that a vote may
not occur until March.  "I hope it doesn't go that long, but I
want all the conferees' concerns to be dealt with," he said
during a televised "roundtable" discussion of the measure.  

          Progress on telecom legislation remains frozen until
congressional leaders reach a deal breaking the budget impasse
and sending furloughed federal government employees back to work. 
Upcoming presidential primary elections also may slow
consideration of the legislation.

          Industry sources last week said Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole (R., Kan.) and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.) may be
unhappy with some provisions in the compromise.  Sen. Dole
reportedly wants to see language reinserted into the measure that
would preempt states from maintaining rate-of-return regulation. 
Speaker Gingrich reportedly is troubled by the removal of
language addressing the foreign ownership of common carrier radio
licenses and provisions addressing radio spectrum, Internet
regulation, and media concentration issues.

           Sen. Pressler said last Friday that a majority of Senate
conferees will approve the legislative compromise crafted late
last month (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  A draft of the 280-page
compromise and an accompanying 93-page explanatory statement
began circulating last week.  "We have essentially nine of the 11
Senate conferees," he said.  "We don't have all of those
signatures yet, but we have indications that we will."  He
acknowledged that Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) likely will not
sign the report.

          Sen. McCain has criticized the compromise measure because
provisions amending current restrictions on foreign ownership of
common carrier radio licenses were removed.  Industry sources
said they believe Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.) is the other
Senate conferee who remains unhappy with the compromise. 
Referring to House conferees, Sen. Pressler said, "I know there
are some problems over there, but we hope to work those out."

          Additional telecom bills may be introduced in the near
future, he predicted, adding that he still hopes to introduce a
bill addressing foreign ownership of common carrier radio
licenses.  "My original bill had that in it but I had to give up
some things I wanted," he said.

          Although he had declared the pending telecom legislation
"dead as Elvis," House telecom subcommittee Vice Chairman Michael
G. Oxley (R., Ohio) said last week that the compromise measure
could "very well come to life with some resuscitation."  House
leaders have been preoccupied with budget negotiations and have
not had much time to focus on telecom legislation, he said. 
Until the budget impasse is resolved, telecom legislation will
remain "in limbo," he said.

          Industry sources last week said a majority of House telecom
conference committee members have committed to sign the
conference report.  But the compromise language apparently still
has not been circulated for their signatures.  House Commerce
Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley (R., Va.) is reluctant to
distribute the report for signatures before telecom subcommittee
Chairman Jack Fields (R., Texas) returns to Washington and
decides whether to support the compromise measure, industry
sources said.  Rep. Fields returned to Texas late last month to
be with his pregnant wife right after the "framework for
agreement" on the final telecom bill was announced.  Shortly
before departing Washington, he criticized the compromise measure
as too regulatory.  It is unclear whether Rep. Fields now
supports the compromise.

          Meanwhile, a draft of the proposed conference report's
"joint explanatory statement" began circulating on Capitol Hill
last week.  Language addressing Bell company entry into the
interLATA (local access and transport area) service market
explains the conferees' intent in imposing a requirement that
Bell companies face facilities-based competition and comply with
the legislation's local exchange competition "checklist."

          The explanatory statement says that "with respect to the
facilities-based competitor requirement, the presence of a
competitor offering the following services specifically does not
suffice to meet the requirement:  (1) exchange access service,
(2) telephone exchange service offered exclusively through the
resale of the [Bell company's] local telephone exchange service,
and (3) cellular service."  To trigger Bell company entry into
the interLATA service market, the legislation requires that a
competitor "offer telephone exchange service either exclusively
over its own facilities or predominantly over its own facilities
in combination with the resale of another carrier's service," the
statement says.

          The "predominantly over its own facilities" language was
included to "ensure a competitor offering service exclusively
through the resale of the [Bell company's] local telephone
service does not qualify, and that an unaffiliated competing
provider is present in the market," it adds.

Conference Agreement Does Not Supersede Consent Decrees

          Conferees believe that the AT&T Corp. and GTE Corp.
antitrust consent decrees and the decree which permitted AT&T to
acquire McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc., are "continuing
injunctions rather than final judgements."  To avoid possible
constitutional problems, the proposed legislation does not
supersede these "continuing injunctions."  Rather, the
legislation provides that activities now subject to the consent
decrees will be subject to the "requirements and obligations"
imposed by the Communications Act of 1934, which the pending
legislation will amend.

          "The conferees intend that the court shall retain
jurisdiction over the three consent decrees for the limited
purpose of dealing with any conduct or activity occurring before
the date of [the pending measure's] enactment," the statement
says.  "Nothing in the language eliminating the prospective
effect of the two consent decrees should be construed as
eliminating the jurisdiction of the court to deal with pre-
enactment conduct or activities under the consent decrees."  The
legislation also should not be "construed as creating or
continuing in any way the GTE consent decree's prohibition on GTE
or its operating companies' entry into the interexchange market."

          The legislation will prohibit Bell companies from entering
the alarm monitoring service business for five years.  Although
Ameritech Corp. will be permitted to continue providing alarm
monitoring services, it will not be allowed to expand that
business until after Nov. 30, 2000. 

          The conference agreement modified language regarding the
provision of pay phone service.  If the FCC makes a "public-
interest" determination, it may choose "not to allow the [Bell
companies] to have the same rights as independent pay phone
providers" in negotiating which interLATA carriers will be
"presubscribed" at the companies' pay phones, according to the
statement.  "In addition, the conferees clarify...that the
location provider has the ultimate decision-making authority in
determining interLATA services in connection with the choice of
pay phone providers."

          The explanatory statement also clarifies the conferees'
intent in adding a provision barring states from exercising
regulatory authority on issues on which the FCC has decided to
"forbear" from exercising its own regulatory authority.  "The
conferees intend this subsection to limit state enforcement of
federal statutes and regulations from which the Commission
determines to forbear," the statement says.  "This subsection is
not intended to limit or preempt state enforcement of state
statutes or regulations." 

          Trade groups seeking to protect the interests of rural
telephone companies are concerned about a change in legislative
language addressing geographic rate averaging for interexchange
service.  The latest draft of the measure requires interexchange
carriers (IXCs) to charge residential subscribers in rural and
high-cost areas the same rates they charge to such customers in
urban areas.  A previous draft of the legislation did not
specifically refer to residential customers, but the industry
groups had understood that it applied to both residential and
business subscribers.

          Rural telecom advocates are worried that the new language
could result in geographic rate deaveraging for business services
because those services are not mentioned specifically in the
bill.  In the draft report, conferees note that they do not
expect the legislation to alter geographic rate averaging
policies now enforced by the FCC.

          Conferees expect that interexchange carriers making
unauthorized changes to a subscriber's primary IXC ("slamming")
will reimburse the original carrier for forgone revenues.  But
they also expect the FCC's rules to "provide that consumers are
made whole" when they are slammed.  "Specifically, the
Commission's rules should require that carriers guilty of
`slamming' should be held liable for premiums, including travel
bonuses, that would otherwise have been earned by telephone
subscribers," the statement says.

          It clarifies that states may require a carrier seeking to
offer services in a rural area to meet the legislation's
requirements for designation as a carrier eligible to receive
universal service support payments.  "That is, the state may
require the competitor to offer service and advertise throughout
the service area served by a rural telephone company," the draft
says.  The provision would not apply if the rural telephone
company has received an exemption, suspension, or modification
that effectively prevents a competitor from meeting the "eligible
carrier" requirements.

Conferees Would Like `Explicit' Universal Service Support

          Conferees intend, "to the extent possible," that any
universal service support mechanisms maintained or created by the
legislation will be "explicit" rather than "implicit," the
statement says.  Conferees do not view the FCC's existing docket
80-286 federal-state joint board proceeding on jurisdictional
separations issues as an "appropriate foundation" for the
universal service proceeding required by the legislation (TR,
July 17, 1995).  Within 15 months of the legislation's enactment,
the FCC must act on a federal-state joint board's recommendations
for defining the services to be subsidized by federal universal
service support mechanisms.

          The legislation requires all carriers of interstate telecom
services to contribute to the "preservation and advancement" of
universal service.  The FCC may exempt a carrier from the
requirement if its contribution would be "de minimis."  Eligible
telecom carriers can receive federal support only to "provide,
maintain, and upgrade facilities and services for universal
service in the area for which the support is received," the
statement says.

          The conference committee included legislative language to
"ensure that the Commission could, if future circumstances
warrant, include commercial mobile service providers which
provide telephone exchange service or exchange access in the
definition of `local exchange carrier,'" the statement continues.

          It also explains the conferees' compromise on controversial
proposals to protect minors from gaining access to "indecent"
material through the Internet.  "Use of the indecency standard
poses no significant risk to the free-wheeling and vibrant nature
of discourse or to serious, literary, and artistic works that
currently can be found on the Internet, and which is expected to
continue and grow," the statement says.  "As the Supreme Court
itself noted when upholding the constitutionality of indecency
prohibitions, prohibiting indecency merely focuses speakers to
recast their message into less offensive terms but does not
prohibit or disfavor the essential meaning of communication. 
Likewise, requiring that access restrictions be imposed to
protect minors from exposure to indecent material does not
prohibit or disfavor the essential meaning of the indecent
communication.  It merely puts it in its appropriate place:  away
from children."

          The draft statement also outlines the conference committee's
reasoning in streamlining the regulatory obligations imposed on
operators of "open video systems."  The conference panel expects
that common carriers will be encouraged to deploy open video
systems, introducing "vigorous" competition in entertainment and
information markets.  Conferees also recognize that common
carriers deploying such systems will be new entrants in
established markets and "deserve lighter regulatory burdens to
level the playing field," the statement says.  In addition, the
development of competition means "that government oversight and
regulation can and should be reduced."

          Regulation of the "cable programming services" tier of cable
TV offerings will sunset March 31, 1999, the statement says.  It
describes a new "effective competition" test for determining when
deregulation of both the cable programming and basic service
tiers should occur.  The test concludes that effective
competition is in place when a telephone company or any
multichannel video programming distributor is offering comparable
video programming services "directly to subscribers by any means"
in an unaffiliated cable TV operator's franchise area.

`888' CODE DEADLINE

          The LEC National Product Team has pushed back the
implementation date for the new "888" toll-free service access
code from March 1 to March 11, according to a letter sent by
MCI's Vice President-federal regulatory affairs, Donald F. Evans,
to the team's Chairman, Dan Winters of Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co.  The Jan. 5 letter says Mr. Winters "indicated to
MCI that the cause of this delay is largely due" to Bell
Communications Research's "missing the due date for delivery. . .
of the [service control point] software to the first field
verification site."

          Mr. Evans added, "We demand that the March 1, 1996, date be
maintained."  At TR's Friday news deadline an FCC-industry 888
meeting slated for Jan. 10 at 9 a.m. in Bellcore's Washington
offices was scheduled to proceed as planned, despite the partial
government shutdown.

AT&T's Workforce Cuts Could Trigger Industry-Wide
Job Reductions, Streamlining, Analysts Predict

          AT&T Corp.'s recent announcement of massive job cuts likely
will trigger further workforce reductions--and other forms of
financial belt-tightening--throughout the telecommunications
industry, particularly among the seven Bell regional holding
companies and GTE Corp., industry observers told TR.  They also
suggested that other U.S. interexchange carriers, and even some
foreign service providers, may further streamline their
operations in the wake of AT&T's action--the largest single job
reduction in the U.S. telecom industry's history and one of the
largest ever announced by an American corporation.  But analysts
differed over the scope of further job cuts, with some observers
noting that many companies already have trimmed their payrolls in
recent years.

          HIGHLIGHTS:  AT&T to cut 40,000 positions, 13% of
workforce...Company will take $4 billion post-tax charge against
1995 earnings...Analysts warn that job cuts could be double-edged
sword...Wall Street bulls say move will make AT&T more
competitive...CWA's President calls job reductions "demoralizing"
to AT&T workers.

          Recognizing that it will be operating in a dramatically
changed competitive environment in the future, AT&T last week
announced plans to eliminate 40,000 jobs over three years, a
reduction of more than 13% of its total present-day workforce of
about 300,000.  The 40,000 figure was double the amount that many
analysts had expected (TR, Oct. 2, 1995, p. 9).  

          AT&T also revealed plans to close, sell, or consolidate some
facilities and write off some assets.  Last week's announcement
represented the "next step" in AT&T's plan to restructure itself,
explained Rick Miller, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer at AT&T, during a Jan. 2 press briefing.  Four
months ago (TR, Sept. 25, 1995), AT&T stunned many industry
observers by unveiling plans to divide itself into three separate
companies:  a telecom services provider, a systems and technology
company, and a computer manufacturer.

          The job reductions, will enable the spun-off companies to be
more "focused," make decisions faster, develop competitive cost
structures, and become leaders in their respective industries,
Mr. Miller said.  AT&T will retain employees with "the right sets
of skills" to keep the three spun-off operations competitive in
the future.  Meanwhile, he said, savings stemming from the job
reductions "will allow the three companies to be competitive." 
Sources agreed that the three future spin-off companies will be
able to operate with relatively small corporate staffs.  Mr.
Miller emphasized that AT&T now will be well-positioned to build
out its personal communications service operations this year.  He
noted that in its third quarter 1995 earnings report, AT&T had
suggested that restructuring charges could be expected.  

Analysts See `Ripple' Effect Throughout Industry

          William H. Gaik, National Director of Deloitte & Touche
Consulting Group's Telecommunications and Electronic Services
practice, said AT&T's announcement could put pressure on all of
its competitors to eliminate more positions and further
streamline operations.  Noting that major telecom service
providers now compete in a global marketplace, he told TR that
France Telecom and Deutsche Telecom, which have not undertaken
significant restructuring programs yet, may now feel pressured to
do so.

          A Communications Workers of America spokesman predicted,
however, that AT&T's move will not trigger massive telecom
industry layoffs.  During the past three or four years, carriers-
-particularly major local exchange carriers (LECs)--have been
"downsizing" in an effort to prepare for a more competitive
marketplace, he noted.  The CWA spokesman maintained that LECs
already have pared away too many jobs--to the point that they are
undermining their service-quality performance.  Because AT&T is
so much larger than most carriers, any job reductions at other
companies likely would be on a smaller scale, he added.

          The job reductions concern the group but they nevertheless
appear to be "in line" with the restructuring plan announced last
fall, the spokesman said, adding that AT&T has been "management
top-heavy" for too long.  CWA analysts believe the spun-off
companies will begin hiring back management personnel once they
begin operating separately, he said.

          Philip Sirlin, a telecommunications analyst with Schroder
Wertheim & Co., Inc., told TR that the AT&T announcement could
generate more job cuts in the telecom industry because "CEOs
don't want to be perceived as being asleep at the switch."  In
particular, he predicted further workforce reductions among the
Bell companies.  MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. also
may need to "reexamine" the operations of their long distance
service units, Mr. Sirlin added.

          But AT&T's action may be a double-edged sword, some
observers suggested.  Although it likely will make AT&T more
competitive in the short term, the job-cutting move could
backfire if AT&T's service quality slips, they explained.  Mr.
Gaik told TR that the job cutbacks could create a "highly
disgruntled workforce," a result that could "spill over" to
customers in the form of poor service.  That, in turn, could help
AT&T's competitors.  Mr. Gaik added that savings stemming from
the job reductions will enable AT&T to price its services more
aggressively and to invest in new technologies.

Wall Street Views AT&T's Action as Necessary Step

          Wall Street analysts generally praised AT&T's action.  In a
statement, Moody's Investors Service, Inc., said the "cost-
cutting moves should improve margins, increase cash flows, and
further solidify the company's Aa3 senior unsecured rating."  It
added that AT&T is "well-positioned to meet the competition and
potentially can improve its credit rating over the long term." 
But Moody's warned that AT&T "faces many long-term challenges as
deregulation and increased competition...exert pressure on
telecommunications margins."  Although the "ultimate" capital
structure of the spin-off companies has not been established,
Moody's is "confident that AT&T's credit quality will not be
seriously impaired."

          Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. reaffirmed AT&T's senior
debt rating of "AA+" (Double-A-Plus) following the company's Jan.
2 announcement.  It said the action reflects AT&T's progress in
refocusing on communications services.  While its core telecom
services business may face growing competition as LECs enter the
interLATA (local access and transport area) service market,
AT&T's restructuring "will help position it to cope with the
added competition," Duff & Phelps said.  "The reduction in
business risk associated with the divestiture of [certain]
enterprises will strengthen overall credit quality.  Meanwhile,
the proceeds raised will give the company added financial
flexibility and allow it to capitalize its remaining units in a
manner consistent with its current rating level."

          In an investment analysis released prior to last week's
announcement, Merrill Lynch had predicted that AT&T would
announce job cuts early this year.  It had suggested that the
company might target some of its savings "to fund the longer term
investments they need to make."  Those would include "entering
the local telephone business, investing overseas as a new entrant
(e.g., Mexico), adding to its marketing staff and promotions, and
rebuilding billing systems" to reduce its dependence on LEC
billing and collection services.

AT&T Takes `Charge' Against Earnings To Cover Restructuring
Expenses

          AT&T will take a post-tax charge of about $4 billion against
fourth-quarter 1995 earnings to cover the cost of implementing
its plan to restructure into three independent companies.  The
charge will be about $6 billion before taxes and "will reduce
fourth quarter net income by approximately $4 billion or about
$2.50 a share," AT&T said.  Those figures could change by the
time AT&T closes its 1995 fourth quarter books later this month,
it added.

          About 70% of the 40,000 jobs will be eliminated this year;
the remaining positions will be terminated in 1997 and possibly
1998.  Sixty percent of the eliminated jobs will be management
positions.  Eighty-five percent of the job reductions will affect
AT&T's domestic operations, and the remaining 15% will be
allocated among several foreign operations, AT&T officials said.

          About 30,000 of the job cuts will be involuntary. 
Meanwhile, 6,500 AT&T managers already have accepted a voluntary
severance package, and an additional 4,000 employees likely will
remain with business units the company intends to sell.  The
severance package was offered to 72,000 managers before the end
of last year.  AT&T officials said last week that the package may
be extended to an additional 40,000 managers, potentially
reducing the number of lay-offs.  A decision to extend the
voluntary severance package will be made within the next 60 days
or so.

          AT&T did not provide information about the planned job
reductions disaggregated by country, state, or company facility. 
But it did reveal plans to cut 6,000 to 7,000 jobs in New Jersey,
where it is headquartered.  The spun-off AT&T telecom services
company will have 110,000 employees after job reductions of about
17,000, AT&T said.  The systems and technology company would have
108,000 employees after reductions of 23,000.  Of the 40,000 jobs
to be eliminated, 10,000 will be corporate-wide staff positions
in the present-day AT&T information systems, human resources, and
financial operations units.  AT&T does not anticipate significant
job reductions in the future, but small-scale job-cutting actions
would occur, a company spokesman said.  AT&T said the fourth-
quarter charge will cover:

          *  Workforce reductions resulting in severance pay and
related costs totaling about $2.6 billion before taxes;

          *  The "write down" of the value of assets, estimated to
total about $1.7 billion;

          *  The closing, selling, or consolidation of facilities that
would not be "strategic" for the spun-off companies' operations
(total costs could reach $1.1 billion); and

          *  Other unspecified actions totaling $700 million.  This
could involve a variety of miscellaneous costs pertaining to the
restructuring, the spokesman said.

          AT&T officials would not comment on what facilities might be
closed or sold, saying that announcements will be made in "due
course."  AT&T already has unveiled plans to sell its Paradyne
unit, a Key Largo, Fla.-based manufacturer of modems for personal
computers (TR, Oct. 23, 1995).  The actions related to the charge
mainly will affect the new AT&T services company and the new
systems and technology company, which will provide network,
business, and consumer technology and equipment.

          AT&T already had announced last year (TR, Sept. 25, 1995, p.
2) that it will eliminate 8,500 jobs at AT&T Global Information
Solutions, which will become part of the spun-off computer
company.  Those jobs are in addition to the 40,000 jobs
reductions announced last week.  AT&T had taken a $1.5 billion
charge against third quarter 1995 earnings to reflect the cost of
the GIS restructuring.

          The new AT&T services company will reduce its workforce
through the "continued application" of new technologies,
consolidation of operator services, and a reduction of marketing
and sales support positions.  It also plans to reduce the value
of some investments, such as its stake in Canadian carrier Unitel
Communications, Inc. (TR, Oct. 2, 1995).  Plans also call for
altering several of the new AT&T services company's online
services by adopting Internet-based technical platforms and for
modifying some messaging services.  Those plans will require AT&T
to write down "the value of some unneeded network facilities--
such as microwave towers--and refocus some of its undersea cable
operations," AT&T said.

Allen Expresses Regret, CWA's Bahr Expresses Bitterness

          AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert E. Allen
said in an electronic mail message to AT&T employees last week
that the job reductions are driven by changes in the marketplace,
as well as by customers' needs, new technology, and public
policy.  "I understand how wrenching it will be for employees and
their families," Mr. Allen said.  "But the actions we are
announcing today are absolutely essential if our businesses are
to be competitive."  For workers leaving the company, AT&T will
provide a severance package, access to a job database, support
for retraining and education, and workshops on financial planning
and stress management.  Employees may be considered for jobs in
the new companies six months after they leave.

          In a statement, CWA President Morton Bahr used unusually
harsh words to criticize AT&T's action.  "AT&T has started off
the New Year by demoralizing its workforce and delivering a
setback to the joint cooperative program we have been attempting
to build with the company over the past three years," he said.  

          Mr. Bahr added that CWA did not receive "the courtesy of
advance notification of today's mass-cutback announcement, which
in the past has been the usual practice prior to such
announcements."  It may take up to 60 days, he said, for AT&T to
provide details on the jobs and locations that will be affected.

          "This is yet another case of the kind of mindless job
destruction that has terrorized working Americans in recent years
as corporate executives play to Wall Street and manipulate their
stock prices," Mr. Bahr said.  

          AT&T "apparently pulled a number out of the air, a big
number that will give their stock price a boost, while they
decide over the next few months what their real employment needs
will be for the new corporate structure."  He added that AT&T
employees and their families "will live in fear not knowing when
and where the ax will fall."  Mr. Bahr said that if AT&T wants to
ensure the success of the three spin-off companies, it should
work to improve employee morale instead of fostering "a climate
of bitterness."

          AT&T plans to file a "registration statement" with the
Securities and Exchange Commission late this month or early next
month for an initial public stock offering for the planned
systems and technology company.  An AT&T spokesman said the
company hopes to offer the stock by the end of the first quarter. 
In addition, AT&T last month asked the Internal Revenue Service
to issue a ruling allowing it to distribute stock in the new
systems and technology company tax-free to AT&T shareholders.  An
IRS ruling against AT&T's proposal could "complicate" plans to
spin off the systems and technology company and force AT&T to
"revisit" the spin-off plans, an AT&T spokesman told TR.

Time Warner Closes Acquisition of Cablevision

          Time Warner, Inc., has closed its acquisition of Cablevision
Industries, Inc., a transaction that positions it to offer
additional video and telephony services in several states.  Time
Warner gained about 1.3 million cable TV subscribers, bringing
its total subscription to 11.5 million customers.  The deal,
announced last year as a stock transaction valued at $2.7 billion
(TR, February 13, 1995), also allows Time Warner to complete its
cable TV "clustering" plan.

          "Our dramatically strengthened cable clusters will keep Time
Warner in the forefront of the core cable business as we roll out
enhanced advertising, pay-per-view, cable online services,
telecommunications services, and interactivity throughout the
systems," said Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer.  He added that as a result of the transaction,
more than three-quarters of Time Warner's customers will be
located in 34 groupings of more than 100,000 customers each.  The
Cablevision properties will augment Time Warner's existing cable
TV holdings in New York, Florida, and North Carolina, he said.

AT&T To Sell Circuit Board Plant in Restructuring

          AT&T Corp. will sell its Microelectronics business unit's
circuit board manufacturing plant in Richmond, Va., as part of a
plan to reduce its workforce and close or sell certain facilities
(see separate story).  AT&T announced last year that it will
divide itself into three separate companies focusing on
telecommunications services, systems and technologies, and
computer manufacturing (TR, Sept. 25, 1995).  The Richmond plant,
which manufactures printed circuit boards and "backplanes," has
about 1,950 employees.  Printed circuit boards, also called
printed wiring boards, contain several layers of wiring paths to
connect integrated circuits and other electronic components. 
Backplanes connect circuit boards within electronic devices.

          AT&T said it hopes that few, if any, of the employees will
lose their jobs under new ownership.  "We plan to initiate
discussions with potential buyers in the next few weeks," said
AT&T Microelectronics President Curtis J. Crawford.  "We hope to
find a company that is committed to keeping the
Richmond...workforce substantially intact."  He added that the
largest customer of the plant's products, AT&T Network Systems,
"expects to continue to depend upon the Richmond Works as a major
supplier after the sale."

          Tommy Thurston, President of Local 2260 of the
Communications Workers of America--which represents nonmanagement
employees at the plant--said, "We had just turned the corner on
making the plant profitable for the first time in a long time,
and this is the thanks we get."  A CWA spokesman in Washington
said union officials have been assured that CWA will have
"successorship rights" under a new owner, allowing it to continue
as the employee's bargaining agent.  But it is uncertain whether
the union's three-year contract, negotiated last summer with
AT&T, would continue to apply.

          AT&T Microelectronics will become part of the systems and
technology company to be spun off from AT&T on Jan. 1, 1997. 
Asked to explain why AT&T is selling the Richmond plant, a
spokesman for the business unit said company planners have
decided that "there's no strategic advantage in owning the
factory."  

          "When we look at how Microelectronics should invest our
resources for the greatest leverage and competitive advantage, we
find it makes more sense to invest in some of our other
businesses...Historically AT&T has been extremely vertically
oriented--we tended to make everything we needed," the spokesman
said.  "But over the years, we've reevaluated and asked whether
we really need to be making these [products] ourselves.  In the
case of these circuit boards, we decided we didn't."

          He added that AT&T hopes to complete the sale by year-end. 
Ideally, the buyer would be a company already manufacturing
circuit boards and seeking to expand both its market share and
manufacturing capacity, he said.  An industry source told TR that
talks with one potential buyer are well advanced.  "I've heard
that the negotiations are down to the final wrangling over
price," the source said.

Shareholders Approve Disney-CapCities/ABC Deal

          Shareholders of The Walt Disney Co. and Capital Cities/ABC,
Inc., overwhelmingly have approved Disney's planned acquisition
of CapCities (TR, Aug. 7, 1995).  The deal still requires
approval by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, whose
review could be delayed by the partial shutdown of the federal
government.  

          It also requires FCC approval of the transfer of certain
television licenses.  One observer last week told TR that the FCC
had intended to act on the license transfers at a scheduled Jan.
18 open meeting, which may be postponed.  Justice review of the
deal is expected to follow the FCC's action.  Disney is involved
in the Americast joint video programming venture with Ameritech
Corp., BellSouth Corp., SBC Communications, Inc., and GTE Corp.

Md. PSC Adopts `Phase II' Competition Rules;
CLECs Praise `Favorable' Interconnection Rates

          In a decision praised immediately by competitive local
exchange carriers (CLECs), the Maryland Public Service Commission
has established interconnection rates, terms, and conditions for
carriers planning to compete in the provision of services to
business end users.  In an order in "Phase II" of its case No.
8584 local exchange competition proceeding, the commission said
that "an essential service such as interconnection should not be
priced as a premium."  CLECs said the rates set by the commission
are "favorable" for promoting competition.  The PSC also outlined
terms for offering unbundled network elements, established an
interim local number portability method, and began a separate
proceeding on universal service issues.

          The PSC authorized local exchange competition in the state
in 1994 when it approved MFS Intelenet, Inc.'s application for
permission to provide local exchange service (TR, May 2, 1994). 
In the 1994 "Phase I" order in the docket 8584 proceeding, it
established interim rates and terms for reciprocal compensation
for call terminations.  It also ordered Bell Atlantic-Maryland to
interconnect with competing carriers' networks at its tandem and
central office switching facilities.

          In the subsequent Phase II of the proceeding, Bell Atlantic
had proposed an interconnection rate structure consisting of
three parts:  (1) a per-minute rate mirroring intrastate,
interexchange access charges, minus the carrier common line
charge; (2) a monthly per-line rate designed to capture the
difference between the revenues received from the per-minute rate
and Bell Atlantic's costs for building a "ubiquitous network" in
the state; and (3) a universal service component to be determined
in the universal service proceeding.

          Bell Atlantic had said that MFS and other "co-carriers"
should be allowed to charge interconnection rates based on the
co-carriers' own costs.  It had opposed setting interconnection
rates for the co-carriers at levels matching its own rates,
citing the need to recover its investment in the "ubiquitous
network" it had built in Maryland and its role as the "carrier of
last resort."  CLECs, meanwhile, had proposed that all local
exchange service providers be required to charge each other the
same cost-based rates for interconnection.  They had argued that
establishing such reciprocal rates would be more efficient and
would promote fair competition.

          Saying that Bell Atlantic's proposal "misses the mark," the
commission ruled in its Phase II order that interconnection rates
paid by CLECs should provide "a contribution to"--but not full
recovery of--the telco's joint and common costs.  "The precedent
certainly does not support [Bell Atlantic's] proposal to recover
joint, common, and other costs [that are] many multiples in
excess of the actual incremental cost of interconnection," the
PSC said.  

          It also rejected calls by some CLECs for a "bill-and-keep"
intercarrier compensation method.  Citing a lack of data on
traffic volumes, it opted instead to establish a specific
interconnection rate to be paid by all carriers.

          The PSC decided to set rates higher for interconnection
provided at tandem switching offices, saying that such
interconnection is more costly for Bell Atlantic.  It adopted a
rate of 0.5 cents per minute of use (MOU) for interconnection at
Bell Atlantic's tandem offices and 0.3 cents per MOU for
interconnection at its end offices.  Bell Atlantic will pay the
same 0.3 cents per MOU rate for termination of calls on the
CLEC's networks.

          Those rates represent a reduction of about 75% from previous
interim rates, MFS Communications Co., Inc., said in a statement. 
In the absence of interconnection agreements, the Bell companies
have in the past levied charges on CLECs seeking interconnection
but have refused to compensate those CLECS for terminating calls
that originated on Bell company networks, MFS said.

          Teleport Communications Group, Inc., noted that it had
proposed a "flat-rated" compensation arrangement that would have
allowed carriers to purchase bulk units of capacity on Bell
Atlantic's network rather than paying per-MOU rates.  The flat-
rated arrangement "more accurately reflects a carriers' true
cost," Teleport said.  The commission rejected Teleport's
proposal, however, noting that most parties preferred an MOU-
based rate to a flat rate.  Carriers may institute flat-rate
arrangements by mutual agreement, the PSC added.  The commission
said it will review the effectiveness of its usage-based rate
system before reconsidering other rate schemes.

          The PSC also took up issues regarding unbundling of Bell
Atlantic's links and ports in its Phase II order.  Last year MFS
and Bell Atlantic jointly tested the provision of unbundled
voice-grade business dial-tone lines in Maryland.  Based on those
trials, Bell Atlantic had proposed tariffs (transmittals nos. 939
and 941) containing rates and terms for unbundled business links
and services connecting Bell Atlantic and CLEC facilities.  The
commission, however, rejected those tariff proposals, directing
the telco to resubmit new tariffs within 30 days based on a rate
structure proposed by the PSC's staff.

          Interim prices for unbundled links and ports should be set
at levels that would be less than or equal to the price of
equivalent elements of bundled local dial-tone service, the
commission said.  Under this method, the ratio between the prices
for unbundled links and ports would reflect the ratios between
the direct costs of providing the links and ports.  That will
allow Bell Atlantic to recover a "proportionate share" of the
amount it recovers through the current bundled dial-tone service
rates, while setting prices at a level that will allow CLECs to
compete, the PSC reasoned.

PSC Bans Bundling of InterLATA Services

          To "mirror" the conditions under which Bell Atlantic
operates, the PSC prohibited CLECs from offering interLATA (local
access and transport area) services bundled with local exchange
services.  CLECs had contended that new entrants should be able
to offer such service packages because Bell Atlantic retains
significant competitive advantages over them.  The PSC said new
market entrants may provide interLATA services but cannot package
them with local exchange service until the interLATA line-of-
business restriction on Bell companies is removed.  CLECs were
allowed to delay providing equal access for intraLATA toll calls
until Bell Atlantic is required to do so.  The PSC also:

          *  Directed Bell Atlantic to file tariffs to offering remote
call-forwarding as an interim number portability system,
determining that rates for that service should be priced at the
incremental network costs of providing it; 

          *  Allowed CLECs to adjust their local calling area
boundaries; and

          *  Gave CLECs the option of (1) providing their own trunks
connecting their end offices to Bell Atlantic emergency "911"
tandems or (2) purchasing trunks from the telco at tariffed
rates.

          The commission denied AT&T Corp.'s request that it set
interim "wholesale" rates for resale of local exchange services,
citing the need for further study.  AT&T has sought authority to
provide local exchange services to business and residential users
in the state (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  The commission is scheduled to
discuss AT&T's application Jan. 17, a PSC spokesman said.                                                             

          A separate proceeding was initiated to explore universal
service issues.  The commission noted, however, that the decision
to launch that proceeding is not a "predetermination that a
universal service fee of some sort will be necessary."  The PSC
will examine whether Bell Atlantic needs a "special" level of
support to serve some customers, but it said, "The evidence
presented in this proceeding leaves us believing that far from
being a negative factor in its operations, the ubiquitous nature
of Bell Atlantic's network in Maryland presents [the telco] with
marketing and business advantages not enjoyed by its
competitors."

          Growth of the local exchange market also should provide Bell
Atlantic with competitive opportunities even if competitors
capture some market share, it added.

          Dan Whelan, President of Bell Atlantic-Maryland, said the
commission recognized that the telco is at a competitive
disadvantage until it can compete in additional interexchange
markets.  The order, however, left "many questions unanswered,
not the least of which is how Bell Atlantic-Maryland can continue
to provide affordable service to all Marylanders when the new
competitors serve only the lucrative business markets," Mr.
Whelan said.  The decision "significantly lowers many of the
technical and economic barriers to local exchange competition,"
said Larry Burgden, Vice President and General Manager for
Teleport's Maryland network.  But "full-blown competition will
not exist in Maryland until the [PSC] acts on other items before
it, such as number portability," he added.

Ameritech-Michigan Proposes Local Exchange Resale Rates

          Ameritech-Michigan has filed an intrastate tariff proposing
rates for the resale of its local exchange services in Michigan. 
The tariff proposal, filed with the Public Service Commission,
offers "wholesale" discounts of up to 20% for some network
services.  Discounts would vary for different network elements
and services and would increase with volume and term commitments,
an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  The tariff, which is subject to
PSC approval, would become effective Feb. 1.

          Ameritech called the filing "another step" in meeting the
requirements of the recently passed Michigan Telecommunications
Act (TR, Nov. 6, 1995).  The tariff includes a proposed 3%
wholesale discount on Ameritech's retail rates for local lines. 
Competitors also could take advantage of an 8% discount on local
usage rates for residential services and 11% discount on local
usage rates for business services.  The discount rate for
intraLATA (local access and transport area) toll services would
be 10% for both residential and business offerings, an Ameritech
spokeswoman said.

          Competitors also would be able to purchase for resale such
enhanced features as Caller ID and voice mail, as well as
advanced business services such as Centrex and ISDN (integrated
services digital network) offerings.  Wholesale discounts would
allow competitors to operate without having to build their own
facilities, giving them "an avenue for entering the marketplace
rapidly," said Jim Wilkes, President of Ameritech-Michigan.

          Meanwhile, AT&T announced last week that it plans to compete
with Ameritech and other local exchange carriers in Wisconsin,
pending the adoption of local exchange competition rules by that
state's Public Service Commission.  AT&T said it initially would
provide service through resale but eventually would offer
facilities-based service.  The company wants to enter the market
by the middle of this year.  "Based upon the [Wisconsin] PSC's
recent decision giving customers the ability to choose the short-
haul long distance provider of their choice, we're confident that
the PSC also will rule in favor of maximum competition," said
Bonnie Manzi, AT&T Vice President-central region.  She called on
the PSC to adopt rules fostering "commercially feasible resale"
of local exchange service and "reasonable" network
interconnection arrangements.

Wireless Industry Pledges To Resolve
Hearing-Aid Compatibility Problems

          Conceding that all digital wireless communications systems
potentially may cause interference to hearing aids, wireless
industry representatives have pledged to develop ways to make
their services accessible to the 6 million U.S. wearers of such
devices.  During a "summit" meeting on the issue held Jan. 3-4 in
Washington, FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt said wireless equipment
manufacturers and service providers should have the flexibility
to determine what transmission technologies they will use in the
future.  But the Commission must ensure that people with
disabilities have access to telecom services, he added.

          Mr. Hundt said the FCC will not adopt what he called the
European model of mandating the use of specific digital wireless
technologies.  "We refuse to let any business talk us into
mandating their particular technology for the use of the
airwaves," he said.  But market forces will not necessarily lead
to the resolution of all compatibility problems.  The FCC must be
ready to protect the interests of groups that traditionally have
wielded little power in the marketplace, Mr. Hundt said.

          Manufacturers, service providers, and consumer advocacy
groups should work together to identify compatibility problems,
he continued.  "This will be a continuous process because
repeatedly we will find incompatibilities between wireless
devices and hearing aids."  He said the Commission anticipates
that specific "action items" will be generated by the two-day
summit meeting, which was sponsored by the Personal
Communications Industry Association.

          The meeting stemmed from concerns raised last year by
hearing-aid consumer advocacy groups.  One group requested that
the FCC initiate a rulemaking to review the potential for systems
using the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) digital
wireless standard to interfere with hearing aids (TR, June 12,
1995).  Wireless industry representatives, however, told the
Commission that it would be premature to launch such a rulemaking
proceeding before conclusive test results were available (TR,
July 24, 1995).

          During last week's meeting industry representatives
emphasized that intensive research on equipment compatibility
already is under way.  Thomas E. Wheeler, President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, reported that the Center for the Study of
Electromagnetic Compatibility at Oklahoma University will release
the initial results of a study on Jan. 15.  CTIA also is
conducting a field evaluation of bystander interference problems
using the personal communications service (PCS) network recently
activated in the Washington, D.C., area by American Personal
Communications.  Results of that research are expected to be
available Feb. 15.  Mr. Wheeler said digital-service interference
problems are no more daunting than those the cellular industry
faced when it introduced analog wireless equipment more than 10
years ago.

          Meanwhile, CTIA has taken steps to ensure that wireless
phones meet European hearing aid standards.  As of July 1, 1997,
CTIA-certified handsets will not interfere with hearing aids that
are designed and tested to meet the requirements of the European
Commission's electromagnetic compatibility product standard for
hearing aids.  A CTIA development group also has devised a
technical standard for phones based on the code-division
multiple-access (CDMA) digital standard.  Hearing aid wearers can
turn off the "variable rate vocoder" component of CDMA phones,
which can be a source of interference for some types of hearing
aids.

          According to panelists at the meeting, several devices are
available that enable hearing-impaired people to use digital
telephones without interference.  The "HATIS" device, for
example, can plug into a wireless phone.  Coupled with a "tele-
coil" (t-coil) hearing aid, it can boost the decibel level on the
hearing aid enough to allow even profoundly deaf individuals to
use the mobile phone.  A similar piece of equipment, known as a
"JABRA" device, provides amplification to non-t-coil hearing
aids.

          George Schmitt, President of Omnipoint Communications, Inc.,
said the availability of such devices does not mean the wireless
industry should stop developing other alternatives for people
with disabilities.  "Operators must serve all the market, or they
will pay in the end," Mr. Schmitt warned.  He observed that some
22 million Americans suffer from some sort of hearing loss "and
there isn't an operator in this world that is dumb enough to
ignore 10% of the population."

          Arnold Pohs, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
of CommNet Cellular, Inc., said, "The industry has accepted its
responsibility to ensure that the transition to digital [wireless
technologies] does not disenfranchise any American."  Mr. Pohs,
who wears a hearing aid himself, added, "Independent scientific
research will provide us with long-term solutions for resolving
electromagnetic compatibility issues."

          Other panelists included engineers from Motorola, Inc.,
Ericsson, Inc., and Omnipoint Technology, Inc., the research and
development arm of Omnipoint Corp.  Mike Williams, a Senior
Engineer at Omnipoint, noted that all radio frequency (RF)
transmitters are capable of causing interference.  Hearing aid
interference occurs mainly when RF signals are amplitude
modulated, he explained.  Such pulse signals are common with
mobile phones based on either GSM or CDMA technologies, he said,
adding that all PCS systems incorporate some sort of amplitude
modulation.  "Higher RF output increases the range of
interference, but that is why the FCC has set limits on output
levels," Mr. Williams said.

          Ray Millington, Vice President and Director-engineering for
the Advanced Products and Technology Division of the Cellular
Subscriber Group at Motorola, said the industry is evolving from
the use of a single antenna site with high-power radios to the
use of several antennas with low-power radios.  That will lead
manufacturers to develop shielding mechanisms and other devices
that can minimize radio interference problems, he said.

Alcatel Wins Multimillion-Dollar PCS Contract

          Alcatel Network Systems has signed a "multimillion-dollar"
agreement with the Sprint Telecommunications Venture (STV) to
supply equipment and relocation services to incumbent licensees
operating microwave systems in the 2 gigahertz spectrum band.  An
Alcatel spokesman declined to give a specific dollar figure, but
he said the deal could be worth millions of dollars, considering
that Sprint wants to offer personal communications services (PCS)
in up to 25 markets this year.  Before offering those services,
Sprint must pay to upgrade or replace the facilities of incumbent
licensees that must clear the 2 GHz band.

          Alcatel is cooperating with STV on several spectrum
relocation projects in the Midwest, the spokesman said.  Last
year STV won PCS licenses covering the Milwaukee, Detroit, and
Indianapolis "Major Trading Areas" (TR, March 20, 1995).  Alcatel
plans to supply incumbents with new radio equipment designed to
operate in the 6 GHz band and to supply PCS back-haul equipment
interconnecting cell sites.

          Meanwhile, Alcatel said last week that Pacific Bell Mobile
Services, another PCS licensee, has purchased new radio equipment
for the spectrum relocation of public safety wireless facilities
operated by the County of Santa Barbara, Calif.  The Alcatel
spokesman estimated that Pacific Bell will spend about $1 million
to relocate five microwave links for the county.  That estimate
is in line with other industry estimates, which put the cost of
relocating a single link at about $200,000 to $250,000.  Alcatel-
-which has submitted bids to all PCS licensees planning to
upgrade or relocate 2 GHz facilities--expects to announce similar
relocation deals with Western Wireless Corp. and BellSouth
Personal Communications, Inc., the spokesman said.  He said there
is a roughly $1 billion market for spectrum relocation services.

Washington Commission Clarifies Local Competition Rules

          Responding to requests by several potential local exchange
market entrants, the Washington Utilities and Transportation
Commission has amended rules for local exchange competition
adopted last November (TR, Nov. 6, 1995).  The potential local
exchange competitors had asked the commission to modify several
rule provisions and to clarify that GTE Northwest, Inc., is
required to file tariffs for unbundled local loop and number
portability offerings.  The commission denied requests that GTE
and US WEST Communications, Inc., be required to offer all of
their services for resale.

          In the November order, the commission had directed US WEST
to file an unbundled loop tariff, but that order had not
mentioned GTE.  In a Dec. 27 order, the commission clarified that
GTE also must file an unbundled loop tariff within 30 days.  The
tariff must offer line-side interconnection and two-wire
interconnection from an end-user's facility to the GTE central
office.  The commission also granted requests by Teleport
Communications Group, Inc., and Electric Lightwave, Inc., that it
require GTE to file an interim number portability tariff within
30 days.  Rates for that service must be set at GTE's incremental
costs.

          The commission said further network unbundling--beyond that
needed to make unbundled loops and line-side interconnection
available--likely will be necessary, but "an immediate need for
more extensive unbundling was not shown in this docket."  It
rejected requests from AT&T Corp. and MCI Telecommunications
Corp. that US WEST and GTE be directed to file a "generally
available tariff for any elements unbundled for any competitor in
response to a bona fide request."

          Competitors also had asked the commission to require that US
WEST offer a four-wire facility, rather than a two-wire facility,
for its unbundled network offerings.  They had argued that a two-
wire facility would limit the ability of competitive local
exchange carriers (CLECs) to provide business and data services
and that four-wire facilities are needed to offer digital
services.  The commission said, however, that two-wire loops will
allow CLECs to serve the "vast majority of residential customers
and business customers without having to buy bundled [US WEST]
services or facilities."  

          AT&T and MCI also had asked the commission to require that
incumbent local exchange carriers (LECs) remove all restrictions
on local exchange service resale.  The interexchange carriers
said their ability to compete in local exchange markets depends
on their ability to resell the incumbent LECs' bundled and
tariffed services.  US WEST had argued, meanwhile, that the
record in the proceeding did not support any action directing
LECs to offer all services for resale.  The commission ruled that
although the general prohibition on resale should be eliminated,
any such action should be considered as part of a general rate
case.

          AT&T called the commission's Dec. 27 order "another step
toward achieving the goal of widespread local competition in
Washington."  Greg Allen, AT&T Vice President-government affairs,
added, "Expanding competition in local telephone service is in
the public interest, since it will mean more features, faster
innovation and better value--all the things that customers
currently enjoy in the competitive long distance market."

US WEST Meets Colo. Party-Line Conversion Deadline

          Avoiding a potential revenue loss of $550,000 a month, US
WEST Communications, Inc., has converted all Colorado multi-party
lines to single-party service, meeting a Dec. 31 deadline.  The
conversions were required by the Public Utilities Commission's
orders in the second phase of the Rural Facilities Improvement
Program (TR, Feb. 8, 1993; and Dec. 11, 1995).  The company
earlier had sought a waiver from the requirement, indicating that
it did not expect to complete the conversions last month.  The
PUC had been considering late last year whether to direct US WEST
to eliminate "tariff riders" which allow the telco to recover the
cost of the conversions.  The rider charges on subscribers' bills
represent $550,000 in monthly revenues, a US WEST spokesman told
TR.  US WEST said its employees made an "extraordinary effort" to
complete the upgrades by Dec. 31.

Time Warner Seeks Mediation in Ameritech Talks

          Expressing frustration over Ameritech-Ohio's intransigence
in talks on interconnection terms, Time Warner Communications has
asked the Ohio Public Utilities Commission to mediate the
negotiations.  Time Warner said agreement has been reached on
"technical" interconnection issues, but talks have hit a snag
over "economic" issues.  Last summer the PUC gave Time Warner
authority to provide local exchange services in the 37 counties
where it operates cable TV systems (TR, Aug. 28, 1995).  Time
Warner requested PUC mediation in its second 60-day report to the
commission on the status of its interconnection negotiations with
Ameritech and other telephone companies.

          Marsha R. Schermer, Vice President-Midwest region for Time
Warner, said negotiations with Ameritech began in December 1994. 
An interconnection agreement must be concluded "by the parties
with commission intervention, or by commission directive, by mid-
January 1996 or the promise of local telephone competition in
Ohio will be even further delayed," she said.  Ameritech appears
"unable or unwilling to negotiate" a reasonable resolution of the
remaining issues, Ms. Schermer said.

          In its request for mediation, Time Warner said, "Some
[Ameritech] charges for key services, for which there are not
current substitutes, are excessive."  Ameritech also has failed
to provide "cost justifications" and has proposed some one-time
charges that are "not appropriate," Time Warner added.  

          It appears that Ameritech's negotiating team, which
represents its Information Industry Services (AIIS) unit, is
"hindered by a lack of authority to revise and modify proposals,"
it told the commission.  Negotiations were "unilaterally
terminated" for several months in May 1995 by "someone at
Ameritech," Time Warner said, adding, "that decision did not
appear to be a decision of AIIS."

          In its response, Ameritech said delays have been caused by
"new issues and demands," including Time Warner's "inappropriate
insistence" that all economic issues be resolved "in a manner
which insures a certain level of profitability for Time Warner." 
Ameritech said a final agreement can be reached on the remaining
issues, "if Time Warner is serious."

          It suggested that Time Warner may have other motives for
filing its mediation request.  James C. Smith, the telco's Vice
President, pointed to the "combination of Time Warner raising new
issues at the bargaining table, publicly complaining to the
[PUC], and conducting a media blitz."  Time Warner appears to be
employing a "tactic to create negative publicity" in an effort to
"stall finalization of our cable TV franchise agreement" in
Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Smith said.  Time Warner officials seem "more
intent on delaying competition in the cable TV market than
negotiating seriously to resolve issues so they can provide local
telephone service," he added.

Brooks Fiber, NYNEX Reach Interconnection Pact

          Brooks Fiber Communications has reached an interim agreement
to interconnect with NYNEX-New England's local exchange network
in Springfield, Mass.  The companies set reciprocal compensation
rates for call termination and agreed on an interim local number
portability arrangement.  The pact paves the way for Brooks to
offer local exchange service on an interim basis, pending the
development of permanent interconnection rules by the
Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities later this year,
Brooks said.  The company plans to begin providing such service
in Springfield early this year.

          "The NYNEX co-carrier agreement was the last major hurdle in
providing local dial-tone [service] in Springfield," said Robert
J. Shanahan, Vice President-northern region for Brooks.  The
company already has a fiber optic network in place and has
ordered an AT&T 5ESS-2000 switch for installation there.  The
interconnection agreement mirrors three others signed by NYNEX
with competitive local exchange carriers in Massachusetts, a
NYNEX spokesman said.

Court Tells Pa. PUC To Rethink Price Cap Index

          A recent ruling by Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court on Bell
Atlantic-Pennsylvania's intrastate price cap plan could lead to
rate reductions for the telephone company's customers.  The court
overturned part of a Public Utility Commission order establishing
a price cap formula for Bell Atlantic, freeing the company from
rate-of-return regulation.  It ruled that the PUC had not taken
into account the difference between the general inflation rate
and the specific inflation rate for economic inputs used by the
telephone company.

          State Consumer Advocate Irwin Popowsky, among others, had
challenged the June 1994 commission order that established an
inflation "offset" factor of 2.93% for the telco's price cap
formula.  The commission's order forbade any rate increases
through 1999 and required the telco to reduce rates if the annual
inflation rate (as measured by the gross domestic product price
index, or GDP-PI) falls below 2.93%.  When the company eventually
is allowed to increase rates, those increases must be limited to
the GDP-PI minus 2.93%.  Rate decreases will continue to be
required whenever the GDP-PI is below 2.93%.

          The court, while rejecting some of the Consumer Advocate's
arguments for a higher offset factor, agreed in its ruling late
last month that the figure fails to reflect Bell Atlantic's
"input price differential."  The inflation rate for Bell
Atlantic's inputs is lower than the GDP-PI, Mr. Popowsky told TR. 
Although the PUC had agreed in principle that there was a
differential, it had not been able to determine the correct
figure.  So the commission effectively had set the differential
at zero by not accounting for it in calculating the offset
factor, Mr. Popowsky said.

          The PUC has not yet decided whether to appeal the court's
decision, commission attorney Alan Kohler said.  Other parties
that had challenged the commission's order include AT&T Corp.,
MCI Telecommunications Corp., the Pennsylvania Cable &
Telecommunications Association, the Central Atlantic Payphone
Association, and the city of Pittsburgh.

Brooks Fiber Acquires Engineering, Consulting Company

          Competitive local exchange carrier Brooks Fiber Properties,
Inc., has acquired the domestic consulting and engineering
business of its affiliate, Brooks Telecommunications, Inc.  The
international operations of Brooks Telecom will be spun off into
a new company, Brooks Telecommunications International, Inc.  The
transaction will make Brooks Fiber a "full-service"
telecommunications provider, the company said.  Brooks
Telecommunications had owned 15% of Brooks Fiber, a company
spokesman said.

          The move will give Brooks Fiber engineering and software
expertise, allowing it to offer customers a "new depth of
consultative support," according to James C. Allen, Chief
Executive Officer of the company.  Acquiring the domestic
consulting unit--dubbed GLA International, Inc.--will give Brooks
Fiber more "management information systems" (MIS) capabilities,
improving its ability to meet interexchange carrier (IXC)
customers' service requirements, Mr. Allen said.  IXCs have
"voiced perpetual disappointment with MIS shortcomings of the
older [local exchange carriers]," he added.  Brooks Fiber
"strongly supports GLA's incumbent senior management.  We have no
intentions of [implementing] significant changes in GLA's present
course, including current staffing levels," Mr. Allen said. 
Brooks Fiber now will have about 300 employees and could have
revenues of more than $40 million in 1996, the company said.

AT&T Slams RHCs' `Generic Me-Too' Waiver Pleas

          AT&T Corp. has opposed granting the Bell companies "generic
me-too" waivers that would extend to them all previous waivers of
the line-of-business restrictions contained in the 1982 antitrust
consent decree.  In a recent letter to the Justice Department's
Antitrust Division, AT&T said the Bell companies have made no
attempt to show that their requests for "wholesale" decree relief
do not raise "different factual and legal issues" than those
considered when the initial waivers were granted.  In many cases,
the original waivers were granted only because they were
justified for a particular Bell company in a particular
circumstance, AT&T said.

          Bell Atlantic Corp. filed the first generic me-too waiver
request late last year, seeking decree relief equal to that
granted by the U.S. District Court in Washington in all previous
waiver orders (TR, Dec. 11, 1995).  Bell Atlantic volunteered to
abide by all terms and conditions set by the court in those
orders.  Since then, several other Bell regional holding
companies (RHCs)--including BellSouth Corp., US WEST, Inc., SBC
Communications, Inc., and NYNEX Corp.--have sought the
department's support for similar waivers.

          Those companies "have simply asserted--without any analysis
or support--that the wholesale extension of all previously
approved waivers to them `does not raise any factual or legal
issues that are significantly different from those raised by the
previously approved waivers' themselves," AT&T told the
department.  "But [that] assertion is false."  

          Although it acknowledged that some Bell companies may be
justified in seeking me-too waivers in specific cases, AT&T
stated that many existing waivers were granted by the court
"solely because they would apply to only one" Bell company and
would not be extended to others.

          As an example, it cited the court's 1989 decision to allow
Pacific Telesis Group to acquire a 10% interest in a transpacific
cable system.  AT&T said that waiver likely would not have been
granted had the court believed that each of the seven RHCs later
would be allowed to obtain equal 10% shares, thus allowing them
collectively to control 70% of the cable system.  

          "Similarly, the prior waiver orders that authorized de
minimis foreign exchange or private line services across LATA
[local access and transport area] boundaries generally rested on
a ground unique to the [Bell company that] requested the waiver,"
AT&T added.

APC, Md. Agency Face PCS Interference Problems

          American Personal Communications has rejected claims that
its personal communications service (PCS) system is interfering
with the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In a
recent letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration
(MTA) stated that the new wireless service has caused "serious
interference" to the communications operations of light rail and
bus services operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations. 
The letter was made public by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing
incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz
spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it had
distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.

          Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs,
expressed concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to
"politicize" the effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to
other spectrum bands.  The relocation of incumbent operators has
been a contentious issue since the FCC first drafted rules
requiring 2 GHz licensees to clear that band to make way for new
PCS licensees (TR, Sept. 21, 1992; and July 19, 1993).  The
Commission recently clarified rules adopted in the Engineering
and Technology docket 92-9 "emerging technologies" proceeding,
further defining "good faith" negotiations over relocation issues
between licensees (TR, Oct. 16, 1995).

          The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions last
fall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transit
communications systems.  "These communications interruptions have
posed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letter
stated.  The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs
incurred as a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman
Anthony Brown declined to comment further on the interference
problems, noting that it involves "a possible issue of
litigation."

            Ms. Schelle told TR that interference problems with the
mass transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to
the MTA, an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have
reported no public-safety problems resulting from interference
between the two radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a
responsibility to respond to frequency coordination notices in a
timely manner, the attorney added.  

          The MTA received at least six such letters indicating that
APC planned to test its PCS system, he said, but MTA officials
failed to respond to a single one.

          "Microwave licensees that ignore frequency coordination
notices do so at their own peril," the APC attorney stated.  "PCS
licensees can only protect licensed facilities if they are
informed of the complete parameters of those facilities'
operations.  APC fully protected the facilities represented on
MTA's FCC license and could not have known, without being
informed by MTA, that MTA is operating at a variance from those
parameters."

Federal Employees Expected To Return To Work;
FCC Issues Public Notice on Filing Deadlines

          Thousands of federal employees were expected to return to
work this week as congressional leaders took steps late last week
to approve a measure restoring the government's ability to pay
them.  About 280,000 federal employees had been furloughed, and
480,000 others had worked for three weeks without pay.  At TR's
Friday news deadline, the House passed, 401-17, a GOP-sponsored
"targeted continuing appropriations" measure (HR 1643) to end the
21-day partial government shutdown resulting from failed budget
negotiations between President Clinton and congressional leaders. 
The measure also was expected last Friday to receive Senate
approval and a Presidential signature.

          If enacted, the measure would allow employees to collect
current and back pay, but it would not provide the funding that
federal agencies need to operate.  Late Friday afternoon,
however, House leaders took up another proposal to fund
government operations through Jan. 26.  If enacted, that measure
will not take effect until President Clinton submits a balanced
budget proposal that has been "scored" by the Congressional
Budget Office.

          Earlier last week the House failed to override President
Clinton's veto of HR 2076, which would have provided fiscal year
1996 funding for the Commerce Department and other federal
agencies, including the FCC.  Lawmakers voted 240-to-159, falling
short of the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto.

          The GOP measure adopted by the House last Friday represents
only a temporary truce in the ongoing budget battle.  It would
guarantee the payment of government workers' salaries through
Jan. 26, when another continuing resolution may be required. 
Office of Management and Budget officials told TR that the
Republican-sponsored measure would permit all furloughed
employees to return to work.  OMB also planned to furnish federal
agencies with guidelines specifying what activities those
employees could perform while appropriations bills are pending.

          Other government sources told TR that the FCC would be able
to conduct a substantial portion of its regular business
activities, despite the continuing appropriations lapse. 
"Basically, the FCC regulates, and that doesn't cost the
government anything," one source told TR.  The Commission should
be able to adopt orders and conduct rulemaking proceedings as
usual, the source said, adding that FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt
wants to proceed with its scheduled Jan. 18 public meeting.  That
meeting appeared to be in jeopardy as long as the partial
shutdown persisted, but the Chairman wants to conduct as much
business as possible once FCC staffers return to work, TR's
source said.

          Anticipating the government's reopening, the FCC Jan. 5
released a public notice revising document-filing deadlines.  All
documents due to be filed with the agency during the shutdown
"will be due no later than 5:30 p.m. on the second day after the
Commission reopens," the notice stated.  "Documents received
during the government shutdown via mail...will be deemed filed on
the first day that the Commission is authorized to reopen," it
stated.  Upcoming filing deadlines will remain in effect unless
the Commission or its bureaus decide otherwise, the notice added.

          GOP leaders predicted last Friday that the House would
approve the second resolution to fund the FCC, the Commerce
Department, and other federal agency operations.  That measure,
however, would not take effect until President Clinton submitted
a plan to balance the federal budget in seven years, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R., Ga.) said last Friday.

          Meanwhile, the government spending freeze could remain in
effect this week.  And although federal employees are expected to
be paid their regular salaries through Jan. 26, government
contract workers are not covered under the measure restoring
federal workers' pay.  In effect, FCC employees could return to
work, but they may not be authorized to spend government money to
do their jobs.  It remained unclear at TR's deadline what
functions the employees would be able to perform under the
expected OMB guidelines.

          Harris Miller, President of the Information Technology
Association of America (ITAA), told President Clinton that the
interim GOP measure was "outrageous."  He said:  "While we are
pleased this proposal helps federal workers, the plan is both
short-sighted and unfair."  In a Jan. 5 letter he criticized
Congress for treating federal contractors as "second-class
citizens."  ITAA represents some 6,700 companies that provide
communications services to government agencies and private-sector
businesses.

          On Friday President Clinton renewed his pledge to submit a
balanced budget plan to Congress.  "I gave them my word I would
work with them to pass a plan which would bring our federal
budget into balance in seven years," he said as the House began
debating the plan to reopen parts of the government.  The
President said he was "ready" and "willing" to continue budget
negotiations with congressional leaders.

          While the FCC remained closed last week, "essential" staff
in the wireless bureau and several attorneys in the Office of the
General Counsel were working.  OMB previously had exempted staff
members in the wireless bureau's Auctions Division from the
shutdown.  Attorneys working on FCC briefs for cases pending in
federal courts also were deemed essential by OMB.

FCC AUCTION REVENUES CONTINUE GROWING

          The FCC's sale of radio licenses resumed last week despite
the federal government shutdown, which concluded its third week
last Friday.  The auction of "multipoint distribution service"
(MDS) licenses ended the week with net revenues of nearly $80
million.  Licenses for the New York, Washington, D.C., and
Fayetteville, N.C., markets attracted the highest bids.  The sale
of 900 megahertz "specialized mobile radio" (SMR) licenses
garnered more than $62.3 million in net bids.  

          The three most active markets were Charlotte, N.C.,
Philadelphia, and Tampa, Fla.  And net bids in the "C" block
auction of personal communications service (PCS) licenses totaled
$1.3 billion.  North Coast Mobile Communications, Inc., bid $225
million for the New York "Basic Trading Area," while
PersonalConnect Communications, Inc., bid more than $120 million
for the Los Angeles BTA and more than $75 million for the Chicago
BTA.

Arianespace Gears Up for Increased Launch Demand

          Arianespace, Inc., is gearing up now to meet the expected
increased demand for launch services in the coming years, a
company spokeswoman said last week.  Arianespace recently
unveiled plans to order additional Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 launch
vehicles to meet the growing demand.  It plans to establish its
own finance company to help clients fund satellite launches, the
spokeswoman added.  Its insurance unit, S3R, also will be
reactivated to help market the Ariane 5, the company's more
powerful, next-generation rocket.

          Arianespace predicts that demand for satellite launches will
grow 30% over the next four years, the spokeswoman said.  The
company plans to order the extra rockets so it can lift 65 to 70
satellites into orbit during 1997 and 1998.  Those plans would
involve 30 Ariane 4 launches and 12 Ariane 5 launches, she noted. 
In 1995, Arianespace deployed 13 satellites aboard 11 Ariane 4
rockets.  The company hopes to launch 17 satellites this year.

          The next-generation Ariane 5 rocket is scheduled to undergo
two technical verification flights in May and September of this
year, the spokeswoman said.  It could be launched commercially by
the end of the year if all goes well.  Meanwhile, fueling
problems on the launch of Malaysia's first national satellite,
MEASAT, forced Arianespace to scrap a Jan. 9 launch date.  The
Ariane 4 rocket also was to deploy PanAmSat Corp.'s PanAmSat 3R

S&P Revises Financial Guidelines for Wireless Companies

          Credit-rating company Standard & Poor's is revising the
financial guidelines it applies to ratings of wireless
communications companies.  The business risks associated with
cellular telephone companies, in particular, have improved to the
extent that many firms can sustain less stringent financial
ratios for the same credit ratings as companies in other
industries, S&P concluded last week.  The new guidelines apply to
cellular and personal communications service (PCS) companies,
although PCS operators are expected to face many of the same
start-up risks as the early cellular companies.

          That will mean that PCS providers "will have somewhat worse-
than-average business risk profiles," and "more stringent
financial ratios will apply" to them, S&P said.  It cited
dramatic growth in cellular subscribership as the reason that
business-risk profiles of cellular companies have improved.

          The ratings firm said its new guidelines also will be used
to assess the credit profiles of large, diversified telecom
companies that own the majority of U.S. wireless assets.  These
include AT&T Corp., Sprint Corp., the Bell regional holding
companies, and major independent telecom companies such as GTE
Corp.  "Although the wireless segment does not represent a
majority of these companies' assets, it is their fastest growing
segment," S&P observed.  "Under the revised benchmarks, companies
with significant cellular holdings are now viewed as being
somewhat less risky, while those with a major commitment to PCS
are viewed as still having significant credit risk for the PCS
portion of their wireless business." 

          S&P will use the following measurements to determine the
credit ratings of wireless communications companies:

          *  Pretax interest coverage.  This is a measurement of
income before interest and taxes--divided by interest costs--that
indicates "earnings protection."

          *  EBITDA interest coverage.  S&P uses a measurement of
cellular cash flow--minus marketing costs and EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)--relative
to total i nterest cost.  This measures a company's minimum
ability to meet interest costs using available cash.

          *  The ratio of total debt to EBITDA.  Total debt relative
to cash flow after marketing costs (EBITDA) is used to determine
a company's debt "exposure" relative to cash flow.

          *  Debt per "pop."  This measures the ratio of total debt to
total "pops" (potential customers).  Wireless properties continue
to be sold or traded, leading S&P to believe that it can estimate
generally the asset value of a particular market.  The debt-per-
pop ratio indicates some degree of financial flexibility.

          *  Debt per subscriber.  As the number of cellular
subscribers increases, S&P believes a more meaningful measurement
of financial risk may be the ratio of debt to the number of
subscribers.  This is because part of a cellular company's
revenues are used to service debt costs.

          In determining the business risk profile of wireless
carriers, S&P considers a number of market factors, including
capital intensity, barriers to entry, competing technologies,
economic conditions, marketing costs, "churn" rates (which
measure the loss of subscribers to competitors), and the
unregulated nature of the industry.  For more information about
S&P's wireless financial guidelines, call Timothy E. Caffrey at
212/208-1750.

Pacific Bell Seeks Approval for ISDN Rate Hike

          Pacific Bell has asked the California Public Utilities
Commission for permission to double the per-minute rates for its
integrated services digital network (ISDN) service and to add a
$125 installation fee.  The company said it needs the rate
increase--from 1 cent to 2 cents per minute--because of the
"exploding" demand for service in areas where it is costly to
install and maintain the service.

          ISDN use has until recently been concentrated near central
offices in metropolitan areas, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman said. 
But she said the increase in consumer use of the Internet and
online services--along with increasing popularity of
telecommuting--has led to more residential installations.  The
company's current ISDN rates will remain in place pending the
PUC's decision, which could take six months or more, she added.

          ISDN service demand in California increased 200% during the
last 10 months, the spokeswoman said.  Pacific Bell has installed
about 60,000 ISDN lines in the state so far--about 30% of which
are in high-cost areas, she said.  A year ago only 5% of ISDN
installations were in high-cost areas (those three or more miles
from an ISDN-equipped central office).  By the year 2000, more
than 70% of California ISDN lines will be installed in
residential areas.  Pacific Bell must recoup its rising
installation costs, but it does not want to discourage potential
subscribers by implementing an even higher installation fee, the
spokeswoman said.  It also does not want to penalize residents of
high-cost areas by charging them more than it charges other ISDN
subscribers.

          In addition to implementing the $125 installation fee
throughout its service area, Pacific Bell would begin levying
per-minute charges during off-peak, night, and weekend hours.  It
plans to end its provision of free ISDN use in all off-peak time
periods, substituting a variety of service packages offering a
combination of free and billable usage at various times, the
spokewoman said.  "We want to place the maximum amount of control
for billing in the customer's hands."

S.C. Regulators OK Price Cap Plan for BellSouth

          In adopting a price cap plan for BellSouth
Telecommunications, Inc., the South Carolina Public Service
Commission properly has "recognized the need" for alternative
regulation of local exchange carriers, a BellSouth official has
said.  Greg Morton, the company's Director-corporate and external
affairs for South Carolina, told TR, however, that a five-year
price freeze imposed on basic local service rates "is too long in
a competitive environment."  BellSouth had proposed a freeze of
only three years.  

          Mr. Morton added that BellSouth is "disappointed" that the
PSC included a 2.1% "productivity factor" in its price cap
formula, which was adopted by the commission Jan. 2.  "We felt
our plan" as originally proposed "had a built-in productivity
factor," in that BellSouth could "never go back and recover"
revenues from price increases it was forbidden to make during the
freeze, he said.

          After the plan's fifth year, the company will be allowed to
increase basic service rates by an amount equal to the rate of
inflation, minus the 2.1% productivity factor.  BellSouth's
intrastate switched access rates are capped for three years.  For
"nonbasic" (competitive and "discretionary," or optional)
services, the company will have pricing flexibility, subject to a
10% annual limit on rate increases.  The PSC will maintain
oversight authority and can refuse to allow rate increases, Mr.
Morton emphasized.

          BellSouth most likely will ask the commission to reconsider
parts of its decision regarding the productivity factor and the
five-year price freeze, he said.  He noted, however, that the
company has not reviewed the PSC's order yet, which has not been
released publicly yet.  BellSouth currently faces no basic local
exchange service competition in South Carolina, but there are
competitive providers of access and short-haul toll services, Mr.
Morton said.  Callers must use "dial-around" access codes to
reach BellSouth's competitors in the state's intraLATA (local
access and transport area) toll service market.

Intelsat Will Consider Restructuring Plan This Year

          By September, Intelsat's Board of Governors expects to have
"a better idea of the future structure" of the international
satellite consortium, said Maury J. Mechanick, Vice President-
international and regulatory affairs for U.S. signatory Comsat
Corp.  Intelsat has a "restructuring work plan in place," Mr.
Mechanick said during a Jan. 3 public briefing on actions the
board took at its Dec. 7-11 meeting in Washington.  A special
Intelsat "working party" and a "special committee" of the board
are exploring the future structure of the consortium, he
explained.  The working party will meet three times this year--
after each board meeting--to develop general policies based on
the board's decisions.  The special committee then will do the
"nitty-gritty work," Mr. Mechanick added.

          As part of Intelsat's ongoing effort to improve customer
service, the board decided at its December meeting to establish
four regional service support centers (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).  The
board will review the support centers' performance at its March
1997 meeting and then decide whether to close or open any
additional centers, Mr. Mechanick said.  Plans for improving
customer service also include restructuring Intelsat's sales and
marketing division and establishing new internal accounting
processes, he added.

          The board also approved deploying the last of its VII-A
series satellites, Mr. Mechanick said.  Two Intelsat VII-A
satellites will be deployed in February, and the last bird in the
series will be deployed later this year.  Work by Lockheed Martin
Corp. on the VIII series of satellites continues, and the board
recently approved a "minor modification" of the contract with
Lockheed that "won't affect the scheduled delivery," he added.

          The contract amendment will enable the Intelsat 805
satellite to provide maximum coverage of Southern Africa.  "While
the current design of the Intelsat 805 satellite provides
sufficient land mass coverage over all of Africa, intersystem
coordination constraints may restrict the use of the Intelsat 805
satellite at 33 degrees East Longitude," Mr. Mechanick explained. 
At the next meeting in Bangalore, India, slated for March 14-19,
the board will consider releasing a request for proposals for two
new satellites to replace two older, Intelsat VI satellites
covering the Indian Ocean region, he said.

          Commenting on financial matters, Mr. Mechanick said the
board approved Intelsat's 1996 budget, which projects $876
million in total revenues and $496 million in capital
expenditures.  Those figures represent a 10.8% increase in
revenues and a 25% decrease in capital expenditures from the 1995
budget.  He said preliminary figures show actual 1995 revenues
totaling $800 million, while operating expenses were $75,000
under budget.

Sprint Shareholders To Vote on Phoenix Deal 

          Sprint Corp. shareholders will meet Jan. 12 at the company's
Westwood, Kan., corporate headquarters to vote on three proposals
to consummate Sprint's alliance with France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom AG.  The "Phoenix" global services alliance won FCC
approval last month (TR, Dec. 18, 1995).  The deal calls for
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom to invest $4.2 billion in
return for a 20% stake in Sprint.  Shareholders have been asked
to approve the investment agreement, related changes to Sprint's
charter and bylaws, and certain "control share acquisitions"
requirements under Kansas state law.  A Sprint official told TR
that the meeting should last only a few minutes because of
expected overwhelming approval of the company's proxy proposals.

Consumer Groups Want Conditions on Time Warner Deal

          Several consumer groups plan jointly to ask the FCC to
attach "severe conditions" on any regulatory approval related to
the proposed merger of Time Warner, Inc., and Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. (TR, Sept. 25 and Oct. 16, 1995).  The groups are
concerned that the proposed "mega-merger," which would create one
of the world's largest media companies, could result in excessive
media company concentration.  They are also worried that it could
limit video programming diversity.

          The request is contained in comments on an earlier, similar
request by the U.S. Telephone Association (TR, Dec. 11, 1995). 
The comments were prepared by the Media Access Project (MAP) on
behalf of the Consumer Federation of America and the Center for
Media Education.  The groups intended to file their comments last
week at the FCC; they will be submitted, instead, as soon as the
partial federal government shutdown concludes.  The groups
reiterated concerns raised in USTA's "request for imposition of
conditions."  They said Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) should
not be allowed to use its ownership stake in Turner Broadcasting
for anticompetitive purposes.  TCI is the nation's largest cable
TV company.  The groups also proposed that the FCC hold an en
banc hearing on issues raised by the proposed merger.

          The groups specifically are requesting that the FCC impose
conditions to ensure programming diversity and access and to
guard against anticompetitive conduct.  But they did not specify
exactly what form those conditions should take.  Conditions could
be attached to any television license transfers that must be
approved by the FCC for the transaction to be finalized, a MAP
source explained.  The FCC also may have the authority to impose
conditions on the provision of cable TV-related services by a
newly merged company, he added.

Court Should Consider Mtel License Separately, FCC Says

          The FCC has told the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
that it should not consider the Commission's licensing scheme for
private paging licensees in its deliberations on whether Mobile
Telecommunication Technologies Corp. (Mtel) should pay for a
license obtained through the agency's "pioneer's preference"
program.  Last month the court heard oral arguments in case no.
94-1552, Mtel v. FCC, in which Mtel challenged the Commission's
authority to charge a $33 million fee for the company's
narrowband personal communications service (PCS) license without
first receiving congressional authority (TR, Dec. 11, 1995).

          During the hearing, Mtel attorneys argued that the company
should not have to pay for its two-way paging license because the
FCC has granted free licenses to other paging companies that will
compete with Mtel.  The court had requested supporting
documentation, which Mtel supplied.  In its response to Mtel's
"post-argument submission," the FCC argued that private paging
licenses are not comparable to Mtel's license.  "Mtel is a
licensee in a brand new service (narrowband PCS) in a newly
allocated frequency band," the agency explained, adding that all
other licensees planning to offer narrowband PCS have paid
substantial sums for their licenses at a government auction.

          The FCC noted that it was Mtel's choice to develop an
advanced two-way paging system.  "To the best of our knowledge,
Mtel did not apply for a private paging license at 929-930
[megahertz]," it said.  Furthermore, "Mtel's choice to commit
substantial amounts of money to its narrowband PCS licenses when
private paging licenses were `free' undercuts its assertion in
this court that the Commission is applying different rules to
identical licenses," the agency added.

Regulatory & Government Affairs: 19 local exchange carriers'
(LECs') proposal to rebalance their rates

          The Nebraska Public Service Commission will hear oral
arguments Jan. 8 on a motion by commission staff members to
"bifurcate" a proceeding on 19 local exchange carriers' (LECs')
proposal to rebalance their rates.  The companies proposed to add
a $2 subscriber line charge to customers' monthly bills and to
reduce access charges by $19 million annually.  M. Gene Hand, PSC
Director-communications, said the staff considers the proposed
change as a local rate increase, since it would not apply to all
LECs in the state.  In a separate proceeding, the PSC plans to
hold hearings around the state Jan. 29-Feb. 8 on a proposed
"consumer bill of rights" for the competitive local exchange
market...

AT OUR DEADLINE. . .

          ANNOUNCEMENT EXPECTED -- Unysis Corp. is expected to make an
announcement Monday, Jan. 8, regarding a "strategic" alliance to
provide telephone network management services.  Unysis would not
release details by TR's Friday news deadline, but a company
spokesman said Unysis will unveil a system to provide "real-time
network monitoring by capturing information from the Signalling
System No. 7 database" used in domestic telephone networks.  

          The major application for such a system, the company said,
is to detect phone fraud "as it is happening."  See today's
TRDaily for a full report on the alliance.

          COMPANY SEEKS AUCTION STAY -- CTA, Inc., of Rockville, Md.,
asked the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington to issue a stay
barring the FCC from proceeding with a Jan. 24 auction of two
construction permits for building and operating a direct
broadcast satellite (DBS) system (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).

          The company argued that the FCC has failed to consider steps
to encourage small business participation in the auction.  The
Appeals Court is expected to rule on the request before Jan. 19,
the date specified by the FCC for auction participants to submit
"upfront" payments.

          ALLTEL EXECUTIVE RETIRES -- ALLTEL Corp. said John E.
Steuri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of its ALLTEL
Information Services subsidiary, will retire May 31.  Mr. Steuri
has been CEO of the information services company since 1988. 
Formerly known as Systematics Information Services, the company
was acquired by ALLTEL in 1990.

Lead Story:
GE Satellite Unit Uses Gibraltar To Seek ITU Geostationary Slots

     GE Capital Satellites International, Inc., a subsidiary of
domestic satellite operator GE American Communications, Inc., has
announced an agreement with the government of Gibraltar to seek 12
geostationary orbital slots for satellite services to Europe,
Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region.  

     The unit of General Electric Co. said the government of
Gibraltar has filed "applications for these orbital locations on
behalf of GE Capital Satellites International" with the
International Telecommunication Union.  "Satellites constructed and
launched to these locations would be operated from a planned
satellite control facility on Gibraltar," which is a British
dependent territory.

     A GE Americom spokesman told TRI that most of its proposed
satellites would operate in the Ku-band frequency with the
exception being one orbital slot covering the Pacific Ocean. 
Satellites covering Africa would operate in both C- and Ku-band
frequencies, he said.

     GE's statement said current plans envision using the
satellites mainly for video programming distribution, including
direct-to-home services and transmissions to cable TV system
headends and broadcast stations.  GE Americom said the planned
satellite design "would accommodate both analog and digital video
formats, as well as other uses, including VSAT [very small aperture
terminal] and data networks."

     To register plans to use geostationary orbital slots in
specific frequency bands, member government administrations notify
the ITU years in advance of government and business proposals for
new satellites.  Generally, administrations forward such
registration notices on behalf of national government entities or
companies under rules agreed to by ITU member nations.  

     In addition, the U.S. government notifies the ITU of Intelsat
satellite plans, and the United Kingdom government does the same
for new Inmarsat satellite proposals.  

     Previously, an agreement under which the Pacific island
Kingdom of Tonga registered slots for use by satellite operators
not based in Tonga led to calls for an update of the ITU "advance
notification" and registration procedures.  The ITU currently is
considering such reforms.

     Scott Blake Harris, Bureau Chief of the FCC's International
Bureau, told TRI that the bureau was not "surprised that a U.S.
corporation chose to file with the ITU through another
administration" rather than through the FCC.  

     He said, "Under no circumstances will we permit any enterprise
to be disadvantaged by having decided to file with the U.S. rather
than another administration."  GE Americom's spokesman could not
comment on the reasons for not filing with the FCC.  

     Mr. Harris said it is not clear that the agreement between GE
Americom and the government of Gibraltar is "improper or untoward." 
He noted that the move "may be appropriate," particularly "if they
don't intend to use the satellites to provide service to the U.S."

     Commenting on the need for ITU reforms, Mr. Harris said the
"whole ITU registration process is in serious disrepair.  I know
the ITU intends to look at it, but in my view, it's urgent that it
do so."  

     He added that "it's critical" that the ITU review include U.S.
government and industry participants.

Satellite Services:
New Loral Unit To Be Globalstar Managing Partner 

     As part of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s $10 billion deal to acquire
most of Loral Corp., Globalstar L.P. will get a respected industry
leader to champion it in the "Big LEO" (low earth-orbit) mobile
satellite services market.  

     Bernard Schwartz, Chairman of Loral, will become Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of Loral Space and Communications Corp., a
new company to be formed in connection with the Lockheed
Martin/Loral deal.  Loral Space will be the managing general
partner of Globalstar, inheriting Loral's 31% stake in Globalstar
as well as other assets.

     Mr. Schwartz is widely credited with building Loral from an
unprofitable company two decades ago into a multibillion-dollar
industry leader today through a series of strategic acquisitions. 
The addition of Mr. Schwartz to the Globalstar management team
diminishes a major criticism of the $2 billion project, said Robert
Kaimowitz, a satellite communications analyst at Unterberg Harris
in New York.  Globalstar has been criticized for lacking a focused
management team, Mr. Kaimowitz noted.  

     Mr. Schwartz said at a Jan. 8 press conference announcing the
deal that he plans to focus most of his time on Globalstar.  Having
Mr. Schwartz championing Globalstar "strengthens" the global
communications project, Mr. Kaimowitz said, adding that Mr.
Schwartz's involvement "ensures that the system will be built."

     Globalstar spokesman Tom Ross echoed similar comments
regarding Mr. Schwartz, noting that the executive's track record is
"very, very good."  In addition to his duties as Chairman and CEO
of Loral Space, Mr. Schwartz will become a Director and Vice
Chairman of Lockheed Martin.  Globalstar investors applauded the
news, sending its shares up $6.375 to close at $40.50 on Jan. 8.

     In a deal valued at more than $10 billion, Lockheed Martin
will buy Loral's defense electronics and system integration
businesses for $9.1 billion, including $2.1 billion of assumed
debt.  It also will invest $344 million for a 20% equity position
in Loral Space at an effective price of $7.50 per share.  Lockheed
Martin will pay $38 in cash per share to Loral shareholders through
a tender offer that was scheduled to begin Friday, Jan. 12.  Loral
shareholders also will receive one share of Loral Space for each
share of Loral.  The transaction is expected to close by the end of
February.

     Loral Space will begin business with more than $700 million in
cash and no debt, the companies said.  Lockheed Martin will provide
Loral Space with support in key technologies while remaining a
major maker of military and commercial satellites.  In addition to
the 31% stake in Globalstar, Loral Space will receive Loral's 33%
interest in Space Systems/Loral, a commercial satellite
manufacturer, and its 22% interest in K&F Industries, Inc., an
aircraft brake company.

     Other assets of the new company will include all of Loral's
Globalstar service provider franchises in Canada, Mexico, and
Brazil and Loral's interest in proposed projects involving domestic
and international direct broadcast satellite (DBS) and broadband
data services.  

     Mr. Schwartz said Loral Space will use its Space Systems/Loral
holdings to expand the new company's DBS business.

     Mr. Kaimowitz said Loral Space has a book value of $1.8
billion or $7.80 a share.  After backing out cash, Globalstar
represents 83% of the assets of Loral Space, he noted.  Loral
Space's book value is broken down as follows:

     *    The 31% interest in Globalstar ($650 million),

     *    The 33% interest in Space Systems/Loral ($150 million),

     *    The 22% interest in K&F ($50 million),

     *    2.8% in management fees from Globalstar ($250 million),

     *    $700 million in cash, and

     *    An undetermined value for the service provider
franchises.

     Mr. Schwartz said one reason Lockheed Martin did not acquire
all of Loral was the high price he placed on Loral's 31% interest
in Globalstar.  Seeing value in the creation of a global
communications network of 48 satellites, Mr. Schwartz pointed out
that globally, more than 3.9 billion people lack telephone service,
and 30 million people currently are waiting for a phone.  

     If Globalstar begins service as scheduled in 1998, Mr.
Schwartz predicted that the company would have three million
customers and $2.7 billion in annual revenues by the year 2002.

     Globalstar's current capital structure consists of $300
million of equity from its 11 partners and $200 million of equity
from its initial public offering in February 1995 (TRI, March 3,
1995, p. 13), according to Globalstar's Mr. Ross.  Loral Space is
the largest Globalstar shareholder, followed by public shareholders
as a group and then Qualcomm, Inc., with an 8% stake.  

     Vendor financing adds another $300 million, and a new bank
financing agreement chips in $250 million.  Additional internal
financing--payments from exclusive service providers (the local
telephone companies) in 73 countries--will contribute another $350
million over the next two to three years, Mr. Ross said.

     The $2 billion project still requires $600 million in
additional external financing.  Mr. Schwartz said Globalstar would
try to raise the money in the debt markets or would turn to Loral
Space and Globalstar's other investors for the funds.  

     Globalstar pulled a $400 million high-yield debt offering from
the market in October (TRI, Oct. 13, 1995, p. 12).  Mr. Kaimowitz
said this happened not because of a lack of investor interest, as
widely believed, but because Globalstar could get "debt at a
cheaper price" from the banks.

     He noted that Loral Space's $700 million in cash and no debt
provides "a vast opportunity to finance the Globalstar project in
very creative ways, with less need for traditional financing
methods."

     The Lockheed Martin/Loral deal is subject to U.S. and European
antitrust and other approvals, and it also requires at least
two-thirds of Loral's shares to be tendered.  

     Lockheed Martin Chairman Daniel Tellep and Mr. Schwartz do not
expect antitrust concerns to stymie the transaction, especially
since Loral's space business will remain a separate company.  Mr.
Kaimowitz agreed, noting that the businesses Lockheed Martin is
acquiring from Loral have very little overlap with its existing
operations.  A $10 billion credit agreement for Lockheed Martin is
being led by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Bank of America, and
Citicorp USA.

Satellite Services:
Comsat Plan To Merge Service Units Approved

     The FCC's International Bureau has approved Comsat Corp.'s
reorganization merging its Comsat Mobile Communications (CMC) unit
into its Comsat International Communications (CIC) unit (TRI,
August 4, 1995, p. 9).  Comsat Mobile handles Comsat's Inmarsat
signatory functions.  Comsat World Systems, which handles its
Intelsat signatory functions, already was part of CIC.  

     Under the reorganization, the World Systems and Mobile
Communications units will be housed in the same CIC division but
continue as separate units to conduct the separate Intelsat and
Inmarsat businesses, respectively.  

     Each line of business will have its own Vice President and
General Manager, who will report to CIC's President.  CIC also will
continue to hold Comsat International Ventures.

     Financial, legal, and human resources support services for the
Intelsat and Inmarsat units will be combined into CIC as part of
the reorganization.  U.S. signatory functions for both of the
international satellite organizations will be consolidated into a
single office, which will be headed by a Vice
President-international affairs.  

     In an order issued Jan. 16, the bureau said Comsat ensured
that a separate accounting system would guarantee that World
Systems and Mobile Communications ratepayers do not bear any
"nonjurisdictional" costs of the consolidated CIC unit.  

     The bureau found that the reorganization is consistent with
the public interest and the Commission's 1982 policy findings on
Comsat's corporate structure and operations.

     Addressing concerns raised by AT&T Corp., the bureau noted
that World Systems will not offer Intelsat earth station services. 


     AT&T also voiced concerns that ongoing Intelsat and Inmarsat
privatization efforts could lead to conflicts of interest for the
consolidated organization.  

     Comsat believes issues relating to privatization of the two
satellite organizations "clearly overlap" so that the same staff
"should be able to handle these issues, subject to appropriate cost
allocation procedures," the bureau noted.  

     It added that "internal conflicts are a normal part of any
large business enterprise" and stressed that the bureau has the
authority to review "any instance in which violations of Comsat's
statutory responsibilities and Commission policy may be alleged." 


     The bureau also addressed concerns raised by C-band maritime
satellite services provider MTN and separate international
satellite operator PanAmSat Corp.  

     MTN had argued that Comsat's provision of maritime C-band
service violates the Maritime Satellite Act and the FCC's
structural separation requirements.  The bureau said, "We see no
need to withhold action on Comsat's proposed reorganization pending
consideration in separate proceedings of MTN's contention that CMC
should not provide C-band maritime services over non-Inmarsat
facilities on an unseparated basis."

     While PanAmSat did not oppose the reorganization, it asked
that a partial waiver of the structural separation requirements
granted to CMC in 1993 not be granted to CWS for "value-added"
services that could be sold in conjunction with its fixed satellite
services.  PanAmSat also called for a "single comprehensive
proceeding" to consider Comsat's entire enterprise.  

     The bureau said it will consider the request for a
comprehensive review separately.  It noted that approval of
Comsat's reorganization "does not extend the partial waiver granted
to CMC to provide a discrete class of maritime services on an
unseparated basis."

Arianespace Needs More Rockets To Meet Demand

     Arianespace, Inc., is gearing up now to meet the expected
increased demand for launch services in the coming years, a company
spokeswoman said recently.  Arianespace recently unveiled plans to
order additional Ariane 4 and Ariane 5 launch vehicles to meet the
growing demand.  

     It plans to establish its own finance company to help clients
fund satellite launches, the spokeswoman added.  Its insurance
unit, S3R, also will be reactivated to help market the Ariane 5,
the company's more powerful, next-generation rocket.

     Arianespace predicts that demand for satellite launches will
grow 30% over the next four years, the spokeswoman said.  The
company plans to order the extra rockets so it can lift 65 to 70
satellites into orbit during 1997 and 1998.  Those plans would
involve 30 Ariane 4 launches and 12 Ariane 5 launches, she noted. 
In 1995, Arianespace deployed 13 satellites aboard 11 Ariane 4
rockets.  The company hopes to launch 17 satellites this year.

     The next-generation Ariane 5 rocket is scheduled to undergo
two technical verification flights in May and September of this
year, the spokeswoman said.  It could be launched commercially by
the end of the year if all goes well.  

     Meanwhile, fueling problems on the launch of Malaysia's first
national satellite, MEASAT, forced Arianespace to scrap a Jan. 9
launch date.  The Ariane 4 rocket also was to deploy PanAmSat
Corp.'s PanAmSat 3R satellite.  The new launch date was set for
Jan. 12.

Intelsat Board To Consider Restructuring Plan This Year

     By September, Intelsat's Board of Governors expects to have "a
better idea of the future structure" of the international satellite
consortium, said Maury J. Mechanick, Vice President-international
and regulatory affairs for U.S. signatory Comsat Corp.  

     Intelsat has a "restructuring work plan in place," Mr.
Mechanick said during a Jan. 3 public briefing on actions the board
took at its Dec. 7-11 meeting in Washington.  

     A special Intelsat "working party" and a "special committee"
of the board are exploring the future structure of the consortium,
he explained.  The working party will meet three times this year--
after each board meeting--to develop general policies based on the
board's decisions.  The special committee then will do the
"nitty-gritty work," Mr. Mechanick added.

     As part of Intelsat's ongoing effort to improve customer
service, the board decided at its December meeting to establish
four regional service support centers.  

     The board will review the support centers' performance at its
March 1997 meeting and then decide whether to close or open any
additional centers, Mr. Mechanick said.  

     Plans for improving customer service also include
restructuring Intelsat's sales and marketing division and
establishing new internal accounting processes, he added.

     The board also approved deploying the last of its VII-A series
satellites, Mr. Mechanick said.  Two Intelsat VII-A satellites will
be deployed in February, and the last bird in the series will be
deployed later this year. 

      Work by Lockheed Martin Corp. on the VIII series of
satellites continues, and the board recently approved a "minor
modification" of the contract with Lockheed that "won't affect the
scheduled delivery," he added.

     The contract amendment will enable the Intelsat 805 satellite
to provide maximum coverage of Southern Africa.  "While the current
design of the Intelsat 805 satellite provides sufficient land mass
coverage over all of Africa, intersystem coordination constraints
may restrict the use of the Intelsat 805 satellite at 33 degrees
East Longitude," Mr. Mechanick explained.  

     At the next meeting in Bangalore, India, slated for March
14-19, the board will consider releasing a request for proposals
for two new satellites to replace two older, Intelsat VI satellites
covering the Indian Ocean region, he said.

Survey of the Americas:
Canadian Regulator Awards New DTH Satellite Licenses

     The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission has awarded licenses for two new Canadian direct-to-home
(DTH) satellite services and five DTH pay-per-view television
programming services.  

     The commission rejected a request from a consortium of cable
operators led by Shaw Communications, Inc., to operate a DTH
satellite distribution service.  It also rejected a proposal by
Power DirecTV to operate a French-language DTH pay-per-view
service.

     The two DTH satellite service licenses went to ExpressVu and
Power DirecTV.  BCE, Inc., and Tee-Comm Electronics, Inc., each own
33% of ExpressVu.  Canadian Satellite Communications, Inc., owns
19% of ExpressVu, and another 14% is owned by WIC Western
International Communications Ltd.  Power DirecTV is 80% owned by
Power Corp. of Canada and 20% owned by Hughes Aircraft Co. of
Canada.  

     That company, in turn, is owned by General Motors Corp.'s GM
Hughes Electronics Corp., which also owns U.S. satellite
broadcaster DirecTV, Inc.

     Licenses for four English-language DTH pay-per-view
programming services were awarded to providers of the
"Sports/Specials" and "Power DirecTicket" services, which will be
offered nationally, and to regional operators of the "Home Theatre"
and "Viewer's Choice" services serving western and eastern Canada,
respectively.

     A license for a French-language DTH pay-per-view service was
granted to Canal Premiere, allowing national distribution of
programming.

     The CRTC said it rejected the Shaw Communications group's
request to operate the "Homestar" DTH satellite service because it
"had significant concerns as to whether the Homestar proposal could
be implemented as proposed, in light of the uncertainty related to
the availability of authorized U.S. services via the Primestar
satellite."  

     The agency said it rejected Power DirecTV's request to operate
a French-language DTH pay-per-view service "because of the
commission's concern that this service would not meet the
objectives of the Broadcasting Act."

     The commission also outlined requirements for the DTH
licensees' provision of basic service and "fair and equitable
access" for programming services.  "In particular, the Commission's
policy requires DTH satellite distribution undertakings to maintain
a predominance of Canadian programming in the total packages they
make available to subscribers," CRTC said.  It will require DTH
distributors and pay-per-view services to contribute 5% of their
annual gross revenues toward the production of Canadian
programming.  

     CRTC said it will not regulate the DTH licensees' rates,
reasoning that "competition between the two new DTH satellite
services, the cable industry, and other distribution technologies
will create sufficient market pressure to discipline rates charged
to subscribers."

Canada Reverses Order Cutting Long Distance Rates

     Industry Canada (the country's industry ministry) has
overturned, in part, a recent decision by the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission requiring
telecom carriers to reduce basic long distance rates.  

     Seven regional telephone companies had asked the government to
reverse the CRTC's decision, which also required them to raise
monthly local rates by $2 (Canadian) on Jan. 1, 1996, and Jan. 1,
1997.  Long distance rates were to be lowered by the same amount. 
The telcos had argued that CRTC's order was an "unwarranted
interference with market forces," the ministry said.  The local
rate increases will go into effect as ordered, it added.

     Industry Minister John Manley said in a statement that the
government took action "to ensure more investment and sustainable
competition in the telecommunications industry. . .The government
believes this decision will help the industry achieve a greater
stability in the marketplace and increase their investment in R&D." 


     Mr. Manley explained that the Canadian industry's rate of
return on equity is about one-third lower than that of U.S.
companies.  As a result, "Canadian companies do not have the same
resources to invest in research and development and for capital
expenditures."

Brazilian Telecom Reform Bill Heads to Legislature

     Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has signed a
draft telecommunications reform bill and presented it to Brazil's
Congress, according to a government official.  The measure would
permit foreign investors to purchase up to 49% ownership stakes in
Brazilian satellites and cellular telephone service providers.  

     If enacted, the legislation could lead to a tripling of
standard telephone lines to 40 million and could increase the
number of cellular phone lines from 800,000 to 17.2 million over
the next eight years, the official said.  The measure also would
address cable TV regulation.

     Over the next three years the Brazilian government wants to
consolidate the nearly two dozen regional phone companies--one for
each Brazilian state--into a "smaller number like five, six, or
seven," the official said.  

     Consolidation could lead to privatization, although ownership
likely would remain in Brazilian hands, the official added.  

     If foreign companies are allowed to invest in Brazil's
telephone companies, the government may require them to develop
research programs to spur technological development in Brazil.

AT&T Opposes 'Full Circuit' Plan of Telecom New Zealand 

     AT&T Corp. has opposed a motion by Bell Atlantic Corp. and
Ameritech Corp. seeking permission from the U.S. District Court in
Washington for Telecom Corp. of New Zealand (TCNZ) to provide the
U.S. "half" of international services between New Zealand and the
U.S.  

     TCNZ, in which Bell Atlantic and Ameritech own 24.82% stakes,
currently is permitted under a 1990 waiver of the AT&T antitrust
consent decree to provide the foreign half of those services.  It
is seeking permission to establish an interconnection point on the
U.S. West Coast to transport international calls originating or
terminating in the U.S.  Then it would hand off calls to U.S.
interexchange carriers (IXCs).

     TCNZ wants to compete with MCI Telecommunications Corp. and
Sprint International, which provide a full circuit between the U.S.
and New Zealand through their affiliates.  

     A full circuit would allow TCNZ "to compete more vigorously in
the market for calls from New Zealand and would allow it to offer
American [IXCs] an additional, low-cost choice for the transport of
outbound international calls," Bell Atlantic and Ameritech said
late last year in their joint motion.

     In its recent response, AT&T told the court that the proposed
waiver modification would enable TCNZ, Bell Atlantic, and Ameritech
"to impose even greater costs on U.S. carriers" and to gain a
competitive advantage "illicitly."  If the Bell companies were
"genuinely concerned about the consumer harms that result from
inflated accounting rates, they would agree to reduce the current
accounting rate on calls between the U.S. and New Zealand," AT&T
said.  

     Granting the motion would allow TCNZ to preserve inflated
accounting rates and permit Bell Atlantic and Ameritech to use
their operating companies' local exchange service monopolies to
hinder competition and harm customers in the U.S.

     In transmitting calls originating in New Zealand over full
circuit "private lines" to the U.S., "TCNZ would avoid its duty to
return to each U.S. IXC a proportionate share of the traffic [the
IXC] sends to TCNZ," AT&T argued.  

     "That, in turn, would exacerbate the settlement deficits of
these U.S. carriers--and increase the surplus of TCNZ--by denying
U.S. carriers the return traffic on which they would earn payments
from TCNZ."  

     AT&T estimated that if the motion were granted, net payments
from U.S. carriers to TCNZ would increase by 75%--even if only 30%
of TCNZ's traffic were carried over full circuits.

Canadian Government Awards Four Nationwide PCS Licenses

     With the third auction of personal communications service
(PCS) licenses getting started in the U.S., Industry Canada has
announced that it awarded four nationwide PCS licenses.  

     Clearnet Communications, Inc., of Pickering, Ontario, and
MicroCell Network, Inc., of Montreal, each were awarded 30
megahertz PCS licenses.  Rogers Cantel Mobile, Inc., and Mobility
Personacom Canada Ltd., were awarded separate 10 MHz licenses.  

     Industry Minister John Manley said the four new licensees will
invest more than $3 billion to develop their PCS systems.  He
estimated that 8,500 new jobs will be created over the next five
years as the PCS market develops.

     "The decision to award the two new, large 30 MHz licenses to
noncellular companies will create a sound industry structure, which
should facilitate the development of enhanced competition and
innovation," said Clearnet Chairman and Vice President Robert C.
Simmonds.  

     Clearnet currently operates enhanced specialized mobile radio
networks for businesses in major metro areas.  Nextel
Communications, Inc., and Motorola, Inc., are minority shareholders
in Clearnet, which now plans to serve the consumer market with its
PCS offerings.  According to Clearnet's market research, one in two
Canadians is interested in using PCS.

     MicroCell Network, which won the other 30 MHz license, is a
start-up company whose major shareholder is Charles Sirois,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Teleglobe, Inc.  A group of
Canadian cable TV companies is among the other major investors in
MicroCell.  

     Rogers Cantel, one of two incumbent cellular service providers
in Canada, will use its 10 MHz license to expand its current
service offerings.  And based in Etobicoke, Ontario, Mobility
Personacom is an affiliate of Mobility Canada, the other Canadian
cellular carrier.  

     Mobility Canada is a national corporation whose "member
companies" are the 11 cellular affiliates of the provincial
landline telephone companies.  The four Canadian PCS licensees will
operate their systems on the same frequencies as their counterparts
in the U.S.--between 1.8 gigahertz and 1.9 GHz.

DBS Permits Extended for EchoStar, Directsat, DBSC 

     The FCC's International Bureau has extended the period during
which EchoStar Satellite Corp. and Directsat Corp. may construct,
launch, and operate direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems.  

     In an order signed Dec. 21 by Bureau Chief Scott Blake Harris,
the bureau gave EchoStar until Aug. 15, 1996, to begin operating a
DBS satellite at its eastern orbital location.  In a separate
order, the bureau gave Direct Broadcasting Satellite Corp. (DBSC)
until Nov. 30, 1998, to construct a DBS system.

     To date, DBSC has paid 2.9%, or $2 million, of the total
satellite contract price, and it is slated to pay 27.2% of the
contract price on Dec. 29.  DBSC also has moved up the schedule for
delivery of its first and second satellites to July 1997 and July
1998, respectively, from September 1998 and March 1999.  

     "Extending DBSC's permit until 1998 will allow sufficient time
for construction of both of its satellites under its modified
construction contract," the bureau said.  "Because we grant this
extension based in large measure upon DBSC's expedited construction
schedule, we will condition the grant upon DBSC's remaining in
substantial compliance with that schedule."

     The bureau deferred ruling on EchoStar's request for a
four-year extension to begin DBS operations from its western
orbital slot.  The recent partial U.S. government shutdown
prevented the bureau from reviewing that request.  

     A ruling will be made when the bureau has had time "to make a
due diligence determination," it said.  Mr. Harris was among the
few FCC employees permitted to work during the partial shutdown.

     On Dec. 28, 1995, EchoStar successfully launched its
"USABSS-3" satellite--part of its planned DBS system.  The
satellite will be positioned in EchoStar's assigned eastern orbital
location at 119.2 degrees West Longitude, and the company plans to
start transmitting in early 1996, the order notes.  

     The bureau also granted EchoStar authority to use in-orbit,
fixed-satellite service C-band (4-6 gigahertz) frequencies for all
telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) functions on the space
station.  TT&C functions are needed for general orbital maneuvers
and spacecraft control operations.  EchoStar had planned to use
Ku-band frequencies for TT&C functions but sought authority to use
C-band frequencies instead, citing lower costs.

     Directsat--which was merged into EchoStar Satellite's parent
company, EchoStar Communications Corp., in 1995 (TRI, Jan. 20,
1995, p. 11)--is scheduled to operate its system on a "companion
basis" with EchoStar's DBS system, the order states.  With the
extension, Directsat now has until Aug. 15, 1999, to begin
operating its DBS system at both of its orbital locations. 
Directsat plans to launch its first DBS satellite into the 119
degrees W.L. orbital location this summer, the order says.  

     It has asked the bureau for permission to modify its DBS
license application to permit TT&C operations in frequency bands
currently allocated for government use.  

     The bureau said that request is under consideration "pending
completion of coordination with government users of that spectrum."

Ameritech VDT Plans Grow Dimmer; Applications Pulled

     Ameritech Corp. has hammered another nail into the coffin of
its video dial-tone (VDT) plans, formally withdrawing five
applications for Communications Act section 214 authority to offer
commercial VDT service.  

     Ameritech officials said the decision to withdraw the
applications, which were approved a year ago by the FCC's Common
Carrier Bureau was prompted by the agency's delay in adopting final
VDT rules.  

     Commission officials have said they will address VDT issues
after Congress completes action on pending telecommunications
legislation.

     While forging ahead with plans to deploy stand-alone cable TV
systems over the past few months, Ameritech officials have hinted
that they might abandon their VDT plans.  

     Approval of the VDT applications had permitted Ameritech to
offer common carrier video service in parts of Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

     At a recent press briefing in Washington, Richard C.
Notebaert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ameritech, told
TRI that the company might consider resubmitting the section 214
applications if it is satisfied with future FCC actions in the
pending docket 87-266 VDT proceeding.  He said Ameritech was
bullish about VDT until the FCC began exploring the idea of
regulating telco providers of video services using a hybrid
regulatory structure drawn from both Title VI (cable TV) and Title
II (common carrier) of the Act.

Sprint Sets Alliance Vote After Receiving FCC OK

     Sprint Corp. has postponed a shareholder vote on measures
related to the proposed Phoenix global alliance but said it expects
to close the transaction--including an investment of more than $4
billion  by France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom AG--by the end of
this month.  

     A meeting for shareholders to approve the investment agreement
and related charter and bylaws changes technically was scheduled to
begin Friday, Jan. 12.  Then it will adjourn temporarily until Jan.
29, when the Phoenix deal will be considered, a Sprint spokesman
explained.  The "adjournment" will not change the Nov. 13, 1995,
record date for shareholders to be eligible to vote at the meeting,
the spokesman noted.

     The postponement stemmed from long lead-time scheduling of the
proxy distribution and the meeting, which were linked to expected
FCC action to approve the deal, the spokesman said.  When the FCC
acted a week later than had been expected, "some things were pushed
back" in closing procedures, he said.  

     Sprint said the price France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom will
pay for new class A Sprint stock will be $48.704 per share.  That
was the maximum price possible under a formula pegged to the
closing price of Sprint common stock during a 20-day trading period
ending 15 trading days before closing of the transaction.

     During its regular meeting Dec. 15, the FCC granted Sprint's
request for a declaratory ruling that the combined 20% investment
by the European carriers would not conflict with Communications Act
section 310(b)(4) restrictions on foreign ownership of common
carrier radio licensees.  

     Presenting the recommendations to the Commissioners, staffer
Kerry E. Murray said the bureau found that France Telecom's and
Deutsche Telekom's acquisition of 20% of Sprint for as much as $4.2
billion would not constitute a transfer of control of Sprint.  

     The bureau found that the transaction would be in the public
interest, subject to several conditions described by Ms. Murray and
International Bureau Chief Scott Blake Harris as "strict."

     Ms. Murray said the bureau found that France and Germany do
not offer "effective competitive opportunities" under the
Commission's recently adopted standard for analyzing foreign
companies' requests to enter U.S. telecom markets (TRI, Dec. 8,
1995, p. 1).  

     But she cited "two important countervailing public interest
factors" for approving the proposed venture.  "Both France and
Germany have begun to implement wide-ranging liberalization plans,
including the introduction of full telecommunications competition
on Jan. 1, 1998," she noted.  The investment by France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom "will enable Sprint to become a more potent
competitor in a wide range of U.S. markets," she added.

     Mr. Harris stated more than once the bureau's conclusion that
the Phoenix alliance will give both Sprint and its French and
German partners short-term competitive advantages in the U.S.,
French, and German markets that will not be available to other U.S.
international carriers.  

     But the conditions imposed by the Commission would mediate
that advantage over the near term and eliminate it by the time the
European Union implements full telecom liberalization on Jan. 1,
1998, he said.

     As explained by Ms. Murray, the conditions are required to
"address the potential for France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom to
engage in anticompetitive conduct and the possibility that the
telecommunications liberalization anticipated in France and Germany
may not be fully implemented on schedule."  She said the bureau
recommended making a public interest finding favoring the Sprint
venture under the following conditions:

     (1) Sprint is regulated as a dominant carrier on the French
and German routes;

     (2) Sprint is not allowed "to increase the number of circuits
it operates on the French and German routes until these countries
allow the use of alternative infrastructure [i.e., private networks
operated by utility companies, railroads, etc.] to provide already
liberalized services, and France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom make
available basic switched voice resale";

     (3) Sprint complies with specified nondiscrimination and
reporting requirements;

     (4) "France Telecom commits to lowering its accounting rate
with the U.S. to that of the United Kingdom and Germany within two
years"; and

     (5)"Sprint reports to this Commission in 1998 whether the
anticipated liberalization occurred in France and Germany.  If it
has not, the Commission will take further action, including
designating for hearing whether certain of Sprint's facilities
authorizations should be revoked."

     Asked about the circuit activation restriction, Mr. Harris
explained to Chairman Reed E. Hundt that beginning with the close
of the joint venture transaction, "all three [carriers] can offer
things to large customers that, in essence, nobody else can."  

     He cited single-party billing, billing in a single currency,
and one-stop problem resolution.  The bureau staff believes that
constitutes an "unfair competitive advantage," he said.  

     The circuit activation restriction, therefore, was imposed as
an inducement for the French and German carriers to allow other
U.S. carriers to provide resale services in their home markets.  

     Mr. Harris said French and German government authorities "have
said it's OK" if the carriers agree to permit resale.  Implementing
that policy would enable other U.S. carriers to develop business
relationships with end-user customers before the widespread EU
liberalization in 1998, he added.  

     Similarly, the restriction should provide an incentive for
France and Germany to stick to the July 1996 timetable agreed to in
negotiations with Mr. van Miert to permit competitive carriers to
access alternative infrastructure networks and to roll out services
that already are liberalized in the French and German markets, Mr.
Harris said.  

     That will enable other U.S. carriers to use networks other
than those of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, and thus avoid
benefitting their competitors in those markets.  "The alternative
would have been simply to walk away from the problem for two years,
and two years is a very long time," he added.

     A DT spokesman told TRI after the Commission meeting that the
requirement that DT open the German market to switched voice resale
could be problematic.  "The question is whether they mean simple
'rebilling' or genuine resale," he noted.  

     He explained that although resale of services to "closed user
groups" such as corporate private networks is permitted in Germany,
"if it's real resale outside of corporate users, it's still a
reserved monopoly service until 1998."   The resale requirement was
one of several outlined by the FCC that may not "reflect the actual
situation in Germany," he said.

     Briefing reporters, Mr. Harris said the inducement for France
and Germany to stick to their alternative infrastructure
liberalization deadline of July 1996--and for the French and German
carriers to enter into agreements with other U.S. carriers to
provide public voice resale--will be the circuit activation
restriction on Sprint.  

     He clarified that the restriction will not apply to Sprint's
acquisition of new circuits but rather to its activation and
operation of new circuits on the French and German routes.

     Asked how the restrictions differ from anticompetitive
safeguards sought by the Justice Department in a proposed antitrust
consent decree to allow the Phoenix venture to go forward (TRI,
July 21, 1995, p. 1), Mr. Harris said, "The two overlap at the
edges," differing largely because the responsibilities of DoJ and
the Commission are different.  While Justice oversees antitrust
law, the Commission's statutory mandate to make public interest
findings enables it to "push for additional conditions" to ensure
greater competition, Mr. Harris said.  

     Both the FCC decision and the consent decree require that
Sprint obtain no special concessions and receive nondiscriminatory
treatment vis-a-vis other U.S. international carriers, he said.  

     But the circuit activation restriction, the imposition of
dominant carrier regulation, and the requirement that the Phoenix
alliance meet the Commission's new "effective competitive
opportunities" test for foreign market entry are unique to the FCC
decision, he explained.

     In an introductory statement at the meeting, Mr. Harris noted
that "several weeks ago, this Commission adopted new rules
governing the entry of foreign carriers into the U.S. market.  

     "We said then that the new rules would both open our market to
more competition and create powerful incentives to open foreign
markets to competition. . .This is the first opportunity we have to
apply those rules, and it may be the most important such
opportunity we have for a long time to come."  

     He said the strict conditions proposed for an order approving
Phoenix constituted a recognition that "France Telecom and Deutsche
Telekom are still monopolists operating in closed markets."

     Asked by Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett whether there is a
risk that the FCC may have to back-pedal on the decision if France
and Germany do not stick to their liberalization timetables, Mr.
Harris responded, "We do not offer you certainty, but this is our
best judgment of where we think these things are going."  

     If the French and German market-opening commitments are not
met, the FCC might decide in 1998 to "pull" Sprint's Communications
Act section 214 facilities authorizations on the French and German
routes, he said.  

     That would adversely affect Sprint, but the test before the
FCC is the impact  on "the U.S. public, consumers, and industry--
not just one corporation," Mr. Harris said.  "Keep in mind that
Sprint is getting $4 billion and is entering a relationship with
two monopolists.    The key to approving this transaction today is
that those monopolists today will not be monopolists for all time,"
he said.

U.S. Regulatory Scene:
PanAmSat Seeks Satellite Licensing Policy Changes

     PanAmSat Corp. has urged the FCC to prevent the "hardening of
the competitive arteries" in the domestic fixed C- and Ku-band
satellite industry by limiting the number of orbital resources a
single company may control.  

     That would "reinvigorate" the Commission's policy of allowing
competitive entry into the domestic fixed satellite market,
PanAmSat said.  It outlined its proposal in comments it planned to
file once the FCC reopened after the heavy snowfall that struck
Washington recently. 

     Specifically, PanAmSat proposed three steps the FCC should
take "to correct the imbalance in competitive opportunities between
existing operators and new entrants" in the domestic satellite
industry.  It suggested the following:

     (1)  Limiting to five the number of domestic arc orbital
locations that any one entity or its affiliates may control; 

     (2)  Making the domestic-system financial qualifications
consistent with those currently in place for separate international
satellite systems; and 

     (3)  Imposing strict requirements, at both the beginning and
end of a satellite's life, to prevent the "warehousing" of orbital
locations.

     PanAmSat said the domestic satellite industry is dominated by
three major players:  Hughes Communications, Inc., GE American
Communications, and AT&T Corp.  

     Those players collectively control about 23 of the 31 domestic
orbital arcs, it told the FCC.  As a result, it added, there is a
"severe shortage" of domestic C- and Ku-band capacity, which in
turn has led to "sharply increased rates" for capacity.  

     PanAmSat asserted that the FCC's own satellite replacement,
system expansion, and financial qualification policies have
"exacerbated" the scarcity of domestic arc resources.

     The FCC's satellite replacement policy generally allows
companies to launch a replacement satellite into the same location
as a previous one, PanAmSat noted.  

     Operators also are permitted to expand existing satellite
systems by acquiring additional orbital slots.  

     "The replacement and expansion policies, in tandem. . .have
allowed existing operators to lock up the vast majority of domestic
arc orbital positions, and in turn, block the competitive entries
of newcomers," PanAmSat said.  

     "The replacement policy effectively has given incumbents
squatter's rights to their long-held orbital positions, [making] it
virtually impossible to dislodge existing operators from the
locations already under their control."

     PanAmSat called the FCC's domestic "financial showing"
standard--which requires operators to produce a current balance
sheet showing sufficient assets to sustain a multimillion-dollar
project--an "insurmountable barrier to entry to smaller companies." 


     Application of the two-step separate international satellite
system financial qualification standard will "encourage the
development of a vibrant separate satellite system industry without
burdening the Commission with laggards or speculators," the company
maintained.

     Noting that the FCC had imposed limits on direct broadcast
satellite (DBS) orbital slots, PanAmSat said similar limits should
be imposed on the number of domestic orbital arcs controlled by one
entity.  

     Setting a limit of five slots would "strike the proper balance
between preserving the Commission's long-standing competitive entry
policies and rewarding existing operators for the substantial
financial risks and significant investments associated with the
establishment and operation of existing satellite networks," it
told the FCC.

     To prevent warehousing of orbital slots, PanAmSat suggested
that the Commission require all satellite applicants to meet "clear
construction and operational milestones."  

     Construction permits for satellites should be awarded on a
conditional basis, subject to cancellation if entities do not meet
such milestones, it said.  A permittee would become a licensee only
if it successfully followed its prescribed timetable.  

     Also, when a satellite nears the end of its useful life, the
Commission should examine whether the traffic it is carrying could
be consolidated with traffic carried by other satellites owned by
the same operator, PanAmSat said.

Telecom Ministry Hints At Delay on Fate of NTT 

     TOKYO--The new head of Japan's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications Ichiro Hino has said in interviews following his
appointment that a final decision on the issue of a Nippon
Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT) breakup may be postponed.  

     Mr. Hino expressed concern that rushing to a decision on an
issue of such strategic importance without a national consensus
would not be the right approach.  Industry sources interpreted Mr.
Hino's comments as a move by the ruling coalition members, Japan's
Liberal Democratic Party and Socialist Party, to offset efforts by
ministry bureaucrats to force a decision within this fiscal year. 


     The end result may be that the politicians gain the upper hand
and delay significant revisions to Japan's telecommunications
industry as they did five years ago when the NTT breakup issue was
first broached and then shelved until 1995.

NTT To Seek 20% Cuts In Long Distance Rates

     TOKYO--Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT) President
Masashi Kojima has announced that the company plans to ask the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications for permission to reduce
long distance call rates.  The cuts would apply to calls over
distances of 160 kilometers by 30 to 40 yen, a cut of almost 20%. 


     At the same time, Mr. Kojima repeated the company's strong
resistance to efforts by the ministry and NTT's new common carrier
competitors to break up the telecom giant.  

     He pointed to the results of NTT's open network policy as an
indication that there is no need to dismantle a nationwide
infrastructure built up over the past century.

     Specifically, he highlighted the scheduled connection of Tokyo
Telecommunications Network (TTNet)--NTT's local loop rival in the
Tokyo metropolitan area--to NTT's subscriber network this month and
the agreements expected to be reached with cable TV telephony
providers in February for similar network connections.

     Mr. Kojima also stressed the benefits of concentrating

Personal Handyphone Use Expected To Lag Forecasts 

     TOKYO--Despite recruiting almost 620,000 subscribers in the
first six months after starting service, Japan's personal
handyphone service (PHS) providers are playing catch-up with their
initial subscriber forecasts.  

     Expectations of hitting the 2-million subscriber mark by the
end of fiscal year 1995 in March 1996 likely will be dashed. 
Observers believe the actual figure could be as little as half that
number. 

     At the current pace of 130,000 new subscribers a month, PHS
providers will just top the 1 million level within the fiscal 1995
time frame.  The below forecast results can be attributed to quick
steps taken by conventional cellular phone competitors to bring
their prices down in order to keep customers away from the cheaper,
newer PHS service.  

     In the past year, cellular providers have reduced initial
sign-up fees and usage rates significantly.  They also switched to
a system of open sale of handheld phone units, rather than leasing
them in a bundled package with cellular service.

     One trend is apparent in the PHS market--Nippon Telegraph &
Telephone Corp.'s (NTT's) grip on the telecommunications market is
weakening.  

     In December 1995 NTT Personal Communications Network companies
signed up just 30,600 new subscribers, compared with 52,400 for the
competing DDI Pocket Phone group companies and 51,300 for the Astel
group companies.

     The NTT Personal group hopes to stem this slide in market
share by slashing its rates.  In a recent application to the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the group indicated that
it will cut the usage rate for calls in the 20- to 30-kilometer
range from 100 yen to 50 yen.  For calls in the 30- to 60-kilometer
range, it proposed to cut the rate from 140 yen to 60 yen.  

     In both categories, the adjustments would make NTT Personal's
rates comparable or as much as 25% lower than its rivals.  While
the DDI Corp.'s Pocket and Astel groups are expected to respond
with their own rate cuts, continuing capital requirements for
network expansion could delay their response. 

     The DDI Pocket group, however, has developed a PHS base
station with its partner companies Kyocera, Kyushu Matsushita
Electric, and Nittsuko that will reduce its investment costs by
one-third its per-station costs.  

     The cost-effective base station should reduce DDI Pocket's
per-station cost and enable it to speed up its network expansion.

European Survey:
France Telecom Chairman Outlines Reorganization Plan 

     France Telecom Chairman Michel Bon recently disclosed a plan
to reorganize the state-owned telecommunications giant around five
branches and outlined a strategy to prepare for competition in the
European telecom market beginning in 1998.  

     Speaking at a company meeting in Paris Dec. 20, Mr. Bon said
the plan emphasizes the need to improve customer services and
increase demand for France Telecom's offerings.  It was devised
after Mr. Bon spent three months in the field, talking with more
than 1,000 employees to understand France Telecom's operations
better. 

     French consumers use their telephone lines an average of eight
minutes per day, while U.S. consumers spend about 20 minutes daily
on the telephone, Mr. Bon pointed out.  He said France Telecom must
increase its 3% annual growth rate to a level approaching AT&T
Corp.'s 9% growth rate.  At that growth level, France Telecom's
traffic would increase from 120 billion minutes annually to 170
billion minutes by the year 2000.  "This objective is realistic and
attainable," Mr. Bon said.  

     The additional traffic is expected to come from increases in
mobile telephony use, "improving the flow and efficiency of
traffic," and "encouraging new uses for telephones," such as
personal computer applications, he explained.

     The plan envisions reorganizing France Telecom around three
operational branches and two functional branches.  The operational
areas would include consumer services, corporate services, and
network services, and the functional branches would include
"development" and "resources."  

     An executive committee will be formed, composed of the
President of France Telecom and the company's five Branch
Directors.  The panel's purpose is "to synthesize and coordinate"
France Telecom's operations, with decisions being made "as close as
possible to the field within each branch," Mr. Bon said.  A
"detailed implementation plan" for the reorganization will be
announced "in the next few weeks," he added.

Ericsson, Ascom Joint Venture Clears EC Competition Hurdle

     The European Competition Commission has decided not to oppose
a wireless communications joint venture between Ericsson, Inc., of
Sweden and Ascom of Switzerland.  

     The companies proposed in late November to establish the
venture through Ascom's Swedish subsidiary, Ascom Tateco.  The
venture will develop, manufacture, and install on-site paging
systems and equipment in markets where both parent companies have
been active, the commission noted.

     The commission's review of the on-site paging market found
that the joint venture will be faced with "sufficient competition.
 . .from the present players, which are either strong multinational
companies such as Philips [Electronics NV], Bosch [GmbH], and
Motorola, [Inc.] or are companies specialized in on-site paging,
such as Multitone."  

     The commission said the market is composed of "large
sophisticated customers. . .who are in a position to exercise
significant bargaining power and who frequently use calls for
tenders to award contracts."

EU Telecom Survey:
Mobile Services Directive Formally Approved by EC 

     The European Commission has formally adopted the Article 90
directive (TRI, July 7, 1995, p. 6), opening European Union mobile
and personal communications markets to full competition.  It is
based on comments to a "green paper" on mobile and personal
communications issued in 1994 (TRI, May 13, 1994, p. 1).  

     The directive requires member states to abolish all exclusive
and special rights for mobile communications.  It establishes "open
and fair licensing procedures" to authorize the launch of digital
services GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), DCS 1800
(the two frequencies available for digital mobile services), and
DECT (for digital cordless telephony within a fixed radius).  

     The directive requires states to lift restrictions on current
licensees for one of these frequencies from applying to extend
their services into the others.  It prohibits member states of the
European Union from restricting the combination of mobile
technologies or systems, specifically where multistandard equipment
is available.

     Existing restrictions on the use of mobile network facilities
will be lifted, the EC said, "allowing new mobile operators to make
full use of their own infrastructure as well as that provided by
third parties such as utilities' networks."

     The EC said the directive will become effective 20 days after
publication in the Official Journal of the EC, which is expected by
the end of January.  

     Member states then have nine months to notify the commission
of the appropriate national measures taken to implement the
directive's provisions.  

     Under Article 90, the commission can adopt directives under
its own authority without submitting them for approval by the
ministers and Parliament.

EU Telecom Survey:
EC Expected To Approve Atlas, Phoenix Ventures

     BRUSSELS--The European Commission has said it will approve the
Atlas alliance between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom AG and
their Phoenix global services alliance with Sprint Corp.  

     While stating its intent to approve the two ventures, the
commission is seeking comments on the deals by the end of January. 


     It recently released details of the two deals and outlined
certain changes made following its intervention. 

     One change for the Phoenix alliance requires Deutsche Telekom,
France Telecom, Atlas, and Sprint to delete France Telecom's and
Deutsche Telekom's international half-circuits from the list of
products that Phoenix would distribute as an agent.  

     The companies also are prohibited from either competing with
or investing in long distance service providers unless they are
controlled by Phoenix.  The commission prohibited Deutsche Telekom
and France Telecom from discriminating in favor of the Phoenix
entities.  

     For the Atlas venture, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom
have agreed to the following changes:  not to appoint Atlas SA as
an agent for international half-circuits; not to integrate French
and German data networks before full liberalization of the
telecommunications infrastructure and services market; and not to
integrate France Telecom's German corporate telecom service
provider, Info AG, into Atlas.  They agreed Info AG must be
divested.  

     In addition Atlas will not be granted terms or conditions that
would enable it to offer services its competitors are prevented
from offering, the commission said. 

     France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are prohibited from
engaging in cross-subsidization.  They have agreed to establish and
maintain third-party access to their public switched data networks
in France and Germany.

     While the commission is unlikely to reverse its decision to
grant approval to both ventures, it is expected that a number of
national telecom operators will file complaints with the
Competition Directorate.

EU Telecom Survey:
EU 'Information Society' To Proceed Despite Doubts

     Some Europeans want to "stop the clock" before proceeding with
telecommunications sector reforms, but engaging in further debate
over whether Europe should develop a new "information society" is
not an option, a senior European official has said.  

     Steven Micossi, the European Commission Director General for
Industry, said at a recent conference that "all basic decisions
have now been taken by the commission" for the telecom sector.  Mr.
Micossi's remarks were made during the annual European Information
Technologies Conference (EITC) held in Brussels.

     "Some member states need to be convinced that privatization
[in] the industry will be beneficial," he acknowledged.  "At any
rate, by January 1998 there will be a de facto open market for the
telecom industry in Europe, where open competition will be able to
develop," Mr. Micossi added.  

     Organized by the commission's Directorate General for
Industry, the EITC conference explored social and cultural issues
raised by the ongoing evolution of European information
technologies.  The conference also highlighted the European Union's
"Esprit" communications research and development program.

     Speaking to reporters after the conference, Martin Bangemann,
Commissioner for Industrial Affairs, Information, and
Telecommunications Technologies, outlined initiatives the European
Union has begun to ensure that Europe is prepared for the evolving
information society.  

     He said significant progress has been made on the first
initiative--to deregulate EU telecom markets.  He emphasized
commitments by France and Germany to liberate alternative
infrastructure markets by July 1, 1996.

     To accomplish goals for deregulation, legislation must be in
place addressing intellectual property rights, data protection, and
competition, Commissioner Bangemann said.  Outdated laws, based on
older technologies, must be modified.  

     He stated that mergers between companies in different sectors
of the communications industry sometimes may be necessary to
strengthen the telecom sector of the EU's economy.  

     Several pilot projects initiated as a result of the G7
ministerial conference earlier this year will spur the development
of information technologies and will make Europeans aware of some
of the practical applications of those technologies, he said.

     Asked about the need to establish an independent EU telecom
authority, Mr. Bangemann said it would be unwise to put the issue
on the agenda for the EU Inter-Governmental Conference slated for
next year.  The issue is highly sensitive and should be examined
carefully before a proposal is presented to Europe's political
leaders, he said.

     In a speech during the conference, Michael Spindler, President
and Chief Executive Officer of Apple Computer, Inc., compared the
current information technologies revolution to the sixth century
"knowledge explosion which resulted from the definition of the
alphabet and mathematics."  

     The current technology revolution will have dramatic economic
impact, he said, citing projections that the U.S. information
industry will amount to $1 trillion by the year 2000 and $1.5
trillion by 2005.  

     Although computer hardware and software will constitute the
largest markets, communications and content development markets
will be important as well, Mr. Spindler predicted.

     The undersea cable units of AT&T Corp. and France's Alcatel
Alsthom have agreed on a $2.6 billion plan to encircle Africa with
an undersea fiber optic cable system.  The "Africa One" project is
being promoted by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU),
RASCOM (the regional African satellite agency), and PATU (the
telecom agency of the Organization of African Unity).  The ITU
formally endorsed the project at a meeting in Tunisia in November,
the companies said.  The project will be funded by the World Bank,

TRI Financial Barometer:
Prices for Global Telecom Stocks End Year Up 15.5% 

     Helping to drive the broader indices to record highs, the
global telecom stocks tracked by the TRI Financial Barometer saw
share prices rise on average 15.5% in 1995.  

     The overall market, as indicated by the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, jumped 33.45% in 1995, closing at 5117.12.  The S&P 500
beat the DJIA in 1995, climbing 34.11% to close at 615.93.

     Share prices for NYNEX Corp. skyrocketed in 1995, climbing
17.25 points or 46.94% to close at an even $54.  

     NYNEX recently reached an agreement with Colonial Data
Technologies Corp. that calls for Colonial Data to be the exclusive
supplier of enhanced Caller ID adjunct products to NYNEX.

     AT&T Corp. also had a profitable year.  Prices for AT&T shares
rose 14.50 points or 28.86% to close at $64.75.  AT&T's recent
announcement that it would eliminate 40,000 jobs over three years
will result in a $3 billion charge to fourth quarter earnings.

     Cable & Wireless plc of the United Kingdom had a good year. 
Its share price rose 84 points or 22.34% in 1995 to close at 460
pence.  

     The company decided on a marketing change for 1996,
substituting the "federation" label for "group."  It said the
change is being made because of confusion surrounding the
federation label, which was used in an attempt to describe the
company's operations in 50 countries.

     Bucking the global trend of price appreciation, Northern
Telecom Ltd. of Canada's share price slipped 4.50 points or 19.25%
before closing at $18.88 (Canadian).  

     The company aligned with Cabletron Systems, Inc., to develop
and market integrated communications and network products.  

     Northern Telecom also said it is near a final agreement worth
more than $150 million over five years with NYNEX for the
distribution and installation of ISDN (integrated services digital
network) hardware and software.

     The company argued that the FCC has failed to consider steps
to encourage small business participation in the auction.  The
Appeals Court is expected to rule on the request before Jan. 19,
the date specified by the FCC for auction participants to submit
"up-front" payments.

SW BELL GETS APPROVAL OF FIVE-YEAR `TELEKANSAS' REGULATION PLAN

Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. closed out 1989 with another
notch in its belt, as far as state alternative regulatory
plan approvals go.  The Kansas Corporation Commission on Dec.
29 unanimously approved the company's five-year "TeleKansas"
plan (TW, June 12), as modified by a settlement agreement
reached early in November between the telco and commission
staff.  The text of the commission's ruling should be released
by the end of January, according to an agency spokesman.

Earlier, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a
three-year experimental regulatory plan negotiated between
PSC staff, Southwestern Bell, and the Office of Public Counsel
(TW, Oct. 2).

The Texas Public Utility Commission is scheduled to begin
hearings on Southwestern Bell's "Texas First" plan on Jan.
22.  A company spokeswoman said that proceeding is not subject
to a statutory time limit.  She noted that the number of
witnesses scheduled to participate could push the hearings
alone, "in a worst case scenario," into six months.

In the Texas proceeding, PUC staff also has proposed that
Southwestern Bell's revenues be reduced by $392,000,000 (TW,
Nov. 13).  The company's Texas First proposal would reduce
its revenues by $72,000,000 annually (TW, Jan. 16).

Under the alternative regulatory plan approved in Kansas,
basic local rates for business and residential customers will
remain at current levels for five years.  These rates will not
be adjusted, as the company had originally proposed, by a
Consumer Price Index/productivity measurement mechanism.
Over the five-year period, the company will make rate
reductions totaling $110,700,000 for toll, intrastate/interLATA
access charges, Touch-Tone, residential service connection
charges, and other services.

The company also will undertake a network modernization program
with an estimated value of $160,000,000 over five years.
Under the program, Southwestern Bell will upgrade all 131 of
its remaining electromechanical switching offices to digital
capability.  The telco also will be permitted flexible pricing
on certain services, such as billing and collection, directory
services, MicroLink I and II (packet switched), Plexar I and
II (Centrex-like), and custom calling.  Instead of the usual
30 days, Southwestern Bell may file rate changes for these
services subject to commission approval in 20 days.  The
commission still could act within the 20-day limit to suspend
rates for the full 240-day period, according to the approved
plan.

The commission also ruled that while the plan is in place,
neither Southwestern Bell nor commission staff will seek to
alter the rates or earnings of the company.  During this
period, other alternative regulatory plans will be explored
and evaluated, it said, noting that it is "not the intention"
to "return to rate base regulation at the end of the five
years."

In the first year of the plan, a $2,000,000 cut in access
charges and a $17,100,000 reduction in intraLATA toll rates
would take effect.  A "1+ Saver" discount plan for  large
businesses would be introduced in the plan's third year.
While Touch-Tone rates would be reduced by 25 cents in the
first year and basic "911" service would be offered free, the
TeleKansas plan also includes rate increases for directory
assistance and rotary hunt services.  Throughout the duration
of the plan, Southwestern Bell will fund dual-party relay
service, offsets for losses on Southwestern Bell toll routes
relating to Optional Community Calling Plans, and an assistance
plan for local service rates.  Residential service connections
charges will drop from $44.15 to $39, and to $36 if the move
is within the same service area.

PACIFIC TELESIS PLANS TO CUT 11,000 JOBS IN FIVE-YEAR EARLY
RETIREMENT, ATTRITION PLAN

Pacific Telesis Group last week announced plans to trim its
management and non-management employee ranks by 11,000 during
the next five years through "early retirement offerings, out-
placement programs, and attrition."  Pacific Telesis currently
employs fewer than 69,000 persons.  Of that number, 64,000
work for Pacific Bell, the group's main operations affiliate.

Since the breakup of the old Bell System in 1984, Pacific
Bell's work force has been reduced by 21% or about 17,000
employees, the company said.  Together with increased operating
efficiencies and growth in the California market, the
downsizing has led to telephone rate reductions of more than
$1 billion since the Bell System breakup, Pacific Telesis said.

Pacific Telesis Chairman Sam Ginn said the force reductions
will occur primarily in Pacific Bell, where about 7600 non-
salaried and 3400 management positions are to be eliminated.
Another 50 positions among the holding company staff will be
cut.  Mr. Ginn noted that Nevada Bell, the group's smaller
telco operating company, recently completed an early retirement
offering that trimmed management ranks by 33%.  Pacific Telesis
said it expects the downsizing to reduce labor costs
substantially over five years and does not expect the costs
of implementing the force reductions to affect net income
significantly.

The company said its early retirement plan will be a permanent
change to existing pension plans for eligible employees in
selected organizations.  Credit for an additional three years'
service with the company and three years of age will be offered
in "selected organizations" within Pacific Bell and the holding
company staff.  The company said employees would be given
details of the offering within a week of the Jan. 4
announcement.  In addition, Pacific Bell managers whose jobs
are identified as surplus but who are not eligible for the
early retirement offering will be given the option of accepting
retraining for other positions within the corporation,
accepting downgrades to other positions, or accepting an "exit
package," Pacific Telesis said.

It said the elimination of 50 jobs at the holding company
level is expected to be completed this year.  The downsizing
effort will include the early retirement offer, retraining,
downgrades, and an out-placement package for eligible
employees.  Surplus holding company-level employees will be
given full consideration for job openings in subsidiaries,
the company added.  The force reduction program will not affect
the group's diversified companies, which include PacTel
Cellular, PacTel Paging, Pacific Telesis International, PacTel
Business Systems, and PacTel Properties.

MARKEY URGES CONSUMERS TO GET INVOLVED IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS
POLICY LEGISLATIVE EFFORT

House telecommunications subcommittee Chairman Edward J. Markey
(D., Mass.) is preparing to act on telecommunications policy,
he has told consumer representatives after meeting with a
diverse group for and against Bell operating company relief
from limitations of the AT&T antitrust consent decree.  He
wrote Dec. 18 to representatives of a dozen organizations
attending a Dec. 12 morning meeting to thank them for
participating and to urge consumer input in the policy effort.
Although he mentioned introducing legislation, the first step
later this month is expected to be circulation of a bill draft
for comments.  The consumer meeting was part of a series of
meetings with varied interest groups as the subcommittee writes
a bill.

"As I mentioned last week," he wrote to consumers, "I intend
to introduce legislation when Congress reconvenes.  I hope I
can count on your support of the process and the consumer
provisions we will be promoting.  I urge your active
participation in this debate."  Concerned about issues being
framed only by industry perspectives, he said, "I cannot stress
enough the importance of your role in promoting the need for
consumer safeguards amongst your membership and their
representatives in Congress.  I believe this is a great
opportunity for the consumer to reap the optimum benefits from
the innovations now occurring in telecommunications
technology."

The letter went to officers of the Consumer Federation of
America, the National Association of State Utility Consumer
Advocates, the American Association of Retired Persons, the
National Consumers League, Consumers Union, Public Citizen,
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the Alliance for
Public Technology, the United Church of Christ, the
Telecommunications Research and Action Center, the Intelligent
Network Task Force, and the World Institute on Disability,
the last two of whom participated in the meeting by telephone
conference call.

FEDERAL-STATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY SUMMIT SLATED FOR
TWO DAYS IN APRIL

The federal-state regulatory summit on telecommunications,
promised by FCC Chairman Alfred C. Sikes at the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners' November
convention (TW, Nov. 20), has been scheduled for April 25-26
in Airlie, Va.  An FCC news release reported that "invitations
have been issued to all chairs of state regulatory commissions"
and said that the meeting "is intended to permit federal and
state telecommunications regulators to explore shared goals
and objectives."  The summit is being co-sponsored by the FCC
and The Annenberg Washington Program of Northwestern
University.  Also expected to attend are representatives of
the National Governors Association.

At the recent NARUC convention, Mr. Sikes had looked forward
to "rekindling a meaningful federal-state dialogue."  He called
for "mutual trust and understanding" in federal-state
discussions, and he asked for a state commitment to developing
"sound, lasting relationships that will lead to achievement
of the goals that are best for the nation."  The FCC Chairman
favored what he called "cooperative federalism," and he warned
that "if we fail to achieve regulatory equilibrium," more
oversight of the telecommunications industry may shift to the
courts.

U S WEST AWARDED EIGHTH BRITISH CABLE TV FRANCHISE;
CONSTRUCTION PLANNED FOR MARCH

Continuing its pursuit of foreign cable television properties,
U S West has acquired an interest in its eighth British cable
franchise.  Last week, Comment Cablevision, a company owned
by U S West and New Jersey-based US Cable Corp., was awarded
the Tyneside franchise, which includes 340,000 homes and 13,000
businesses.  U S West's seven other British cable franchises-
-Birmingham, Camden, Croydon, Haringey, Kingston/Richmond,
Merton/Sutton, and Windsor--include approximately 1,500,000
households, the company said.  It also has cable TV interests
in Hong Kong (TW, Aug. 7) and France (TW, May 9, 1988).


The third-largest cable franchise ever awarded by the United
Kingdom Cable Authority, Tyneside includes Gateshead,
Newcastle, Ponteland, and North and South Tyneside, U S West
said.  It noted that construction is slated to begin in March,
with completion expected in 1994.  The estimated construction
cost is $160,000,000, it said.  Noting that British cable
franchises carry telecommunications licenses, U S West
anticipated that "Comment Cablevision will offer telephone,
facsimile, and data services along with cable television."

AFTER SPECIAL MEETING, NARUC UNIT TO CIRCULATE COMPENDIUM OF
VIEWPOINTS ON MFJ RELIEF

Members of the Communications Committee of the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners spent from
Jan. 2-5 sequestered at the Asilomar Conference Center in
Pacific Grove, Calif., hearing a variety of industry views on
Bell operating company modified final judgment relief issues.
The 15 commissioners present--or three-fourths of the
committee's members--agreed to develop a compendium of industry
positions on the three core decree restrictions.

To be circulated to all committee members, the compendium
would not only state an industry player's position on the
subject but also the players' motives for taking such a
position.  The group also discussed conducting a survey of
all NARUC members on their views about lifting the AT&T
antitrust consent decree restrictions.  The committee had
decided at its meetings last summer (TW, July 31) to hold an
educational, closed-door session similar to one conducted in
l986 at Dartmouth College.  At the Dartmouth gathering, state
regulators had studied BOC line-of-business relief and public
network advancement issues before developing a consensus for
use in the first triennial review of the consent decree's
restrictions.

The purpose of the "son of Dartmouth" California gathering
was to revisit the committee's MFJ resolutions, particularly
in light of legislation pending before Congress to lift BOC
business prohibitions.  Commissioners devoted most of the last
two days of the conference to discussing MFJ relief position
options.  Development of a specific resolution on a group
consensus would be left for the NARUC winter meetings scheduled
for the last week of February.  Observers noted that from
commissioners' discussions, it was hard to pin down whether a
consensus existed on modifying any of the decree restrictions.
Although some commissioners reportedly wondered aloud what
the harm would be in lifting the information services bar,
for example, any consensus on this specific issue was unclear
following the discussions.

ONA CONFERENCE MEMBERS FROM AMERITECH REGION SUGGEST TRIALS OF
TARIFFING APPROACHES

Ameritech region state members of the federal-state joint
conference on open network architecture (ONA) issues have
proposed a means of letting the Bell regional holding
companies' ONA plans be implemented without waiting for
resolution of jurisdictional tariffing issues.  The Dec. 19
memorandum to fellow joint board members, signed by Michigan
Public Service Commission Chairman William E. Long and Ohio
Public Utilities Commissioner Gloria L. Gaylord, noted
consensus among conference members on several major policy
areas.  The only contentious issue, they said, is the degree
to which ONA services should be tariffed at the federal level.

They pointed out that Ameritech region regulators jointly
have filed comments supporting that RHC's "dual tariffing"
approach.  Rather than calling for a delay in ONA
implementation at the federal level until the tariffing issue
is resolved, the two commissioners urged that the agency adopt
one or more regional plans on an experimental basis.

They offered the Ameritech region plan as one of the approaches
that should be tried.  "It is our view that concurrent approval
by the FCC of several plans would serve to launch the ONA
process and, at the same time, permit actual experience with
alternative programs to supplant what seems to be endless
rhetoric and debate on this subject," the regulators said.

They stressed that "the actual experience gained in this area
would allow for a more comprehensive and insightful examination
of potential problems involving the federal tariffing of ONA
services.  Since certain regions appear to have legitimate
concerns regarding this issue, they would have the benefit of
valuable information gleaned from the experience of others
which would enable them to make more fully informed decisions
in this regard.  Indeed, the conservative approach that we
have just outlined seems well calculated to accomplish not
only the commencement of ONA in some regions, but afford others
additional time to study the situation."

In noting areas of accord among conference members, the four-
page memorandum mentioned "unanimous agreement that the cost
allocation procedures outlined in the FCC's part 36
(separations) rules should not produce any significant mismatch
of costs and revenues resulting from the implementation of
ONA at either the state or federal levels."  It also observed
that the conference is "in almost total agreement that maximum
uniformity should be achieved with respect to ONA to the
greatest extent possible."

In addition, the document stated that the conference is "in
general agreement that certain ONA offerings must be filed at
the state level.  Notwithstanding the various (third computer
inquiry court) appeals" (TW, Jan. 17), "intrastate filings of
ONA services should recognize the statutory authority reserved
for the state commissions in determining the terms and
conditions of intrastate BSEs (basic service elements) and
(basic serving arrangements)," they noted.

At the joint conference's last public meeting in November,
New York Public Service Commission Deputy Chairman Gail
Garfield Schwartz had suggested that the FCC could forbear
from requiring the interstate tariffing of BSEs, without
reaching the jurisdictional question (TW, Nov. 20).  State
versus federal tariffing is one of the issues before the FCC
in reconsideration pleas lodged against its order granting
conditional approval of Bell operating companies' initial ONA
plans (TW, Nov. 21, 1988), and in its docket 89-79 proceeding
on access charge changes required for an ONA environment (TW,
April 3).

OREGON ORDERS U S WEST TO CUT REVENUES BY $24,057,000, LET
DIRECTORY ADS SUPPORT COSTS

The Oregon Public Utility Commission has ordered U S West
Communications to reduce its revenues by $24,057,000 this
year, "so that U S West customers will receive benefits from
telephone directory advertising profits."  As a result of the
ruling, U S West Communications' local and toll rates will be
cut by approximately 5% for residential and business customers.

The PUC criticized the company for attempting to withhold
from its Oregon customers the benefits of a telephone directory
publishing agreement with U S West Direct.  Despite the telco's
"representation that the public would benefit from the
publishing agreement and asset transfer (in 1984), U S West
formulated a corporate strategy in 1986 to divert directory
profits from ratepayers to stockholders," the PUC said.

"The company acknowledged that the strategy would cause local
rates to increase, but (it) nevertheless concluded that it
should pursue the goal of flowing as many dollars to the
shareowners as possible, while minimizing the risk of
imputations from regulatory agencies," the PUC noted.  It
stated that information gathered in the investigation of U S
West Communications' rates showed that in 1985, the
contribution from directory advertising was $40.10 annually
per customer.

Specifically, the PUC directed that the telco's Oregon revenue
requirement include approximately $29,000,000 in profits from
directory advertising.  At the same time, the PUC ordered
adjustments in U S West's revenue requirement related to other
issues.  As one of these adjustments, it allowed the telco to
recover in rates approximately $6,500,000 for research and
development supplied by Bell Communications Research.  The
PUC accepted its staff's and the telco's settlement agreement
addressing the company's capital structure and setting its
rate of return on equity at 13.53%.  Its overall rate of return
was set at 11.2%.

The commission began the investigation of U S West's earnings
in December, 1988.  At that time, the PUC staff estimated
that the company was exceeding its authorized rate of return
by approximately $65,000,000.  Staff later modified its
position after further study during the investigation.  At the
beginning of the investigation, the company had indicated
that it was entitled to a rate increase of approximately
$24,000,000.

INVESTIGATION OF SOUTHERN BELL PAY PHONE COMMISSIONS SPREADS
THROUGHOUT ITS TERRITORY

Florida's investigation of Southern Bell Telephone and
Telegraph Co. pay phone commissions to government agencies
has spread to all four states the company serves.  The
Attorneys General of Florida, Georgia, and the two Carolinas
exchanged information last week at a meeting in Atlanta
initiated by Florida's chief lawyer.  None of the
investigations was far enough along to result in legal moves,
and the company was withholding comment.

Meanwhile, in the wake of some settlements affecting jail and
airport phones, the Florida Attorney General is advising
government agencies to hold off settling accounts pending
investigation.  Involved are commissions on calls at coinless
public phones that make up 5% of all Southern Bell pay phones.
The company has traced commission accounting questions to
switching, finding translation problems in central offices.
Its own investigation is still under way.

KANSAS STAFF RECOMMENDS AGAINST AT&T PRICE STABILITY PLAN,
PROPOSES RATE REDUCTION

The staff of the Kansas Corporation Commission has recommended
that AT&T reduce its basic long distance rates by $2,300,000
per year.  At the same time, it advised the commission not to
adopt AT&T's price stability plan (TW, July 24).  AT&T had
proposed that, after a year's freeze, it should be allowed to
change basic long distance rates based on the annual change
in inflation, offset by a 2.5% productivity factor.  After
the second year, AT&T would be able to change rates without
pricing restraints.

Staff did not find the plan to be in the best interest of
customers.  It noted that AT&T currently is allowed to increase
rates by up to 4% or decrease rates by up to 7% without filing
a rate case.  "AT&T's plan does not act to stabilize rates to
any further degree than the previous flexibility granted AT&T,"
it said.  Staff proposed that AT&T be required to file a
traditional rate case for basic rate increases, but it said
that AT&T could be allowed to lower rates on 20 days' notice.
The commission scheduled Jan. 10 and 17 public hearings on
the AT&T and staff proposals.

BELL ATLANTIC TO SERVE AS NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS MANAGER
FOR HARDEE's PAY PHONES

Bell Atlantic Corp. and Hardee's have cooked up a deal whereby
the regional holding company will serve as the fast-food
chain's national telecommunications manager for pay phones.
During a two-year trial, Bell Atlantic will provide account
management and consulting services with respect to public
phones Hardee's will install in its 1100 corporately owned
restaurants across the country.  The agreement, however, does
not cover an additional 2900 Hardee's outlets that are operated
as franchises, Bell Atlantic said.  It added that it will
offer similar "national pay phone consulting and management
services to other large chains such as quick food, convenience
stores, and hotels."  The regional holding company said that
outside of its territory, it will act strictly as a consultant,
"actually bringing business to pay phone providers."

AT&T FILING NEW BROADLY AVAILABLE STATE TARIFF 16 PLAN, AS
BUREAU LETS SOCS TAKE EFFECT

AT&T was expected, possibly as early as TW's Friday news
deadline, to file a new generally available State Calling
Service (SCS) under its controversial tariff no. 16 for
"competitively bid governmental services."  Meanwhile, the
FCC Common Carrier Bureau last week denied "reject or suspend"
petitions filed against AT&T's State Outbound Calling Service
(SOCS).  Originally filed under transmittal no. 1782 for
members of the Michigan Collegiate Telecommunications
Association (TW, Sept. 4), SOCS was expanded under transmittal
no. 1959 to be available to all "institutions of higher
education owned and operated by a state government or to state
and local government agencies" (TW, Dec. 18).

In its Jan. 5 order, the bureau found that the interexchange
carrier competitors opposing the two SOCS transmittals
presented "no compelling argument" that it should reject or
suspend the tariff.  SOCS, thus, was allowed to take effect
on Jan. 6.  The new generally available SCS offering was
mentioned in AT&T's response to those opposing its transmittal
no. 1959 as the reason why AT&T had not projected any
additional demand or revenues to result from the expanded SOCS
availability.  It is expected that state governments and higher
education institutions will find the new SCS offering more
attractive, a company spokesman noted.

DIALING & DEALING

After several deferrals, AT&T's new "location account billing
option" for software defined network (SDN) service (TW, Sept.
11) was allowed to take effect on Jan. 6, more than one month
after AT&T had received the go-ahead to implement other
portions of a package of SDN rate level and structure changes
previously filed at the FCC (TW, Dec. 4).  The option allows
customers "to include on their networks, under separate bills,
location customers which operate with the SDN customer in a
common business . . .and which the SDN customer owns or
franchises" or "provides centralized management, oversight or
coordination."  The option took effect after the Common Carrier
Bureau last week found "no compelling argument" to suspend or
reject the filing.  Earlier last week, AT&T had filed
additional revisions to the proposed option, under transmittal
no. 2004.

-AUSTRIAN GSM CELLULAR LICENCE AWARDED

TWW-2 January 1996-AUSTRIAN GSM CELLULAR LICENCE
AWARDED
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

VIENNA, AUSTRIA- The Austrian government has awarded
the first competitive GSM cellular licence to a
consortium backed by Siemens and Deutsche Telekom
known as Oe-Call.  Oe-Call bid US$397m for the
licence -- the highest of the five applicants. 
Viktor Klima, transport minister for the Austrian
government, said that the competing service was
forecast to bring down prices by as much as 30%. Some
competing consortia said that the bid was unfair as
Siemens was an important equipment supplier to the
Austrian Post Office -- operators of the other GSM
service.  An appeal is permitted under Austrian law
although to date no company has said that it intends
to take advantage of this option.

PORN, USERS PROTEST
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

BONN, GERMANY- CompuServe, the giant US online
computer network service, has suspended worldwide
access to over 200 Usenet messaging groups following
concerns raised by German politicians over the
illegal pornographic nature of some contents. Users
throughout the world have criticised the company for
its actions, saying that the claims are unfounded and
that many worthwhile groups have been hit by the
action.  A raid had been made in November at offices
from the German federal prosecutor's office where
files and systems were examined.  Observers say that
the move had dire consequences for other Internet
service providers and point out that CompuServe needs
to engineer a system to restrict country-by-country
access in cases where it is forced to instead of
hitting all users worldwide. CompuServe has been keen
to point out that it did not have any input into the
Usenet groups being suspended over claims that they
contain child pornography and other undesirable
material.

-BRITISH AD WATCHDOG CLAMPS DOWN HEAVILY ON
ADVERTISERS

TWW-2 January 1996-BRITISH AD WATCHDOG CLAMPS DOWN
HEAVILY ON ADVERTISERS
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- The Advertising Standards Authority, the
British ad industry watchdog, has clamped down on a
number of firms for their recent breaches of the
advertising code.  PEOPLES PHONE COMPANY PLC has seen
a complaint against it upheld where it offered a free
pocket colour TV on the purchase of a mobile phone. 
The complainant stated that the offer was only valid
for a select number of phones and not the entire
range as implied and noted that the offer was only
being offered for analogue handsets and not the
digital ones.  The company said that the offer
applied to all mobile phones and not all tariffs with
the exclusions listed in footnotes.  The ASA said
that the adverts should have been more clearly stated
to avoid confusion and requested that greater care be
taken in the future.  TOBYWARD LTD, trading as
Private Lines, had a complaint against it upheld
following objections to a mail order advert for
 Computer Hard-core Interactive Intercourse' which
was carried in PC Mart.  The crux of the complaint
centred around the tone of the language in a magazine
often bought by children.  In response Tobyward said
that they were aware of the sensitive nature of the
material, which had been certificated by the British
Board of Film Classification and that they thought
the publication was aimed at 18 to 35 year olds and
tailored the advert accordingly.  The SAA said that
while it had no objection to the adverts it requested
that a different headline be used if the same advert
was to be used in non-adult publications. VIRGIN
INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT had a complaint against a
poster campaign upheld which featured the images of
dictators along with the strap  previous high
scores.' The ASA noted that permission had not been
given by President Chirac of France (who was featured
in the ads) and requested that the campaign not be
re-run.  IPC CORPORATION (UK) LTD had complaints
against it upheld following objections to an advert
which featured Pentium computers with a strap "50%
cashback. Choose any model from the fantastic
Cashback range and you'll be eligible to claim back
an amazing 50% of its purchase price in just five
years time." The advertiser said that the advert
contained two separate offers not applicable to all
products and the ASA said that the rules were not
very clear and requested amendments be made to the
advertisements.  GATEWAY 2000 EUROPE came under fire
after Dell Computer Corp, the Personal Computer
Association and members of the public complained over
adverts claiming that they had the first Windows 95
PCs on sale today and that every Gateway 2000 PC now
features Windows 95. The complaints stated that
Windows 95 was not on sale at the time of the
adverts' appearance and challenged the claims.  The
public complaints also noted the use of VAT exclusive
prices.  Gateway admitted it had acted wrongly,
claiming that the adverts were put together hastily
and the ASA requested that greater care be taken in
the future. Complaints were also upheld against ESCOM
who stated that it had over 160 stores nationwide and
open up to 8pm on Thursday nights when not all of the
stores operated late night opening policies; GAME LTD
was censured after it advertised management positions
with a retailer of multimedia technology with the
headline  Personality isn't everything' featuring a
young woman wearing a mini-dress and a man embracing
her behind the neck; RANK XEROX was censured for
using pictures of Trevor McDonald and Alan Whicker in
adverts for printing and copying machines without
their permission, claiming that such pictorial use
implied their recommendation of the machines;
HUTCHISON ORANGE was censured following a direct mail
shot which offered trade-ins through a dealer which
apparently did not exist when the recipient called
local outlets and ISLRIS RACING SERVICES were
censured for a press advert which failed to give the
correct call rates for a premium rate telephone
number listed.

-DISPUTE OVER INTERNATIONAL CALL LIMITATION GOES ON

TWW-2 January 1996-DISPUTE OVER INTERNATIONAL CALL
LIMITATION GOES ON
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- An agreement has still to be reached
between BT, Mercury Communications and telephone
regulator Oftel over the timetable for the removal of
BT's and Mercury's sole rights to operate
international telephony networks out of the UK.  
While national service offerings are a free-for-all,
international service operation is still limited.  
Oftel is keen to open all of the markets, the
telephone companies naturally want to retain as many
advantages as possible and the UK government's
Department of Trade and Industry says that it is
broadly in favour of opening markets but notes that
it is discussing the move with the EU and World Trade
Organisation. Figures for 1994 show that 3.13bn
minutes of outbound telephone calls were made and
3.58bn minutes of incoming calls -- a surplus of 44m.

TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- The British government is planning to
invest millions of pounds in backing for a new
Internet project which will allow UK firms to
showcase their activities on the Internet.   The
funding would come out of the government's
 information society initiative' which would provide
support for companies looking at utilising the
Internet and the so-called information superhighway
as a worldwide window.  Backing for the service,
where budgets have yet to be revealed, is being made
by the Federation of Electronics Industry, trade
organisations and firms such as IBM, BT and Fujitsu. 
The planned offering would also include order
matching, overseas business promotion, access to
marketing sources and trade awareness.

-COST OF COMPUTER SYSTEM COULD THREATEN OPEN POWER
MARKET

TWW-2 January 1996-COST OF COMPUTER SYSTEM COULD
THREATEN OPEN POWER MARKET
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- Plans by the UK government to open up the
domestic electricity market for competition are under
threat due to delays in the development of a complex
computer system needed to ensure compliance and open
activity.  The government and Coopers & Lybrand, the
retained consultancy, have confirmed that there are
serious doubts over whether a GBP100m computer system
could be operational by 1 April 1998 -- the date set
for domestic competition.  Some government sources
have hinted that matters have also been protracted
because of electricity companies proving to be less
than cooperative with many aspects of the plan.  The
computer system would mirror the electricity pool
used for commercial electricity affairs although it
will need to be larger and more powerful because of
the differing numbers of customers.  One option
facing the government is a phasing in of system
functionality and relative options.   There has also
been a number of rows over just who is to pay for the
computer system.  The government is expected to
announce a number of amendments to the programme in
January.

-COMPLAINTS MADE OVER OFTEL'S BT CLAIMS

TWW-2 January 1996-COMPLAINTS MADE OVER OFTEL'S BT
CLAIMS
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- A number of complaints have been lodged
against Don Cruickshank, director general of Oftel --
the British telecommunications regulator -- over
comments he recently made about BT, Telecomworldwire
understands.  In November Cruickshank accused BT at a
public forum of failing to implement fair trading
throughout its business, suggesting that BT took the
view that there was no corporate harm in having anti-
competitive practices unless the regulator
intervened.  Oftel was not available for comment at
the time of going to press over the complaints
apparently lodged against Cruickshank.  Meanwhile
Oftel is to take action and monitor BT's activities
in the Internet service provision market following
some industry concerns that BT would be acting anti-
competitively and stifling fair competition in this
growing sector.   Some Internet service providers
have received a letter from Oftel admitting that BT
is cross-subsidising its services although the
regulator is presently watching the situation,
declining to take any action as the venture is still
effectively as a start-up.  Certainly commercially it
would not be sensible for BT to upset the market too
closely as it is a major supplier of leased lines and
secondary circuits and provision to many Internet
service providers in the UK.

-CLAMPDOWN ON UK MOBILE PHONE USERS

TWW-2 January 1996-CLAMPDOWN ON UK MOBILE PHONE USERS
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- Several cellular service providers are
clamping down on their customers mobile phone usage
in a bid to cut fraud.  One network reseller has
already placed a ceiling of GBP50-worth of calls
without a deposit being paid and large deposits are
being demanded off GSM digital cellular users who
wish to take full advantage of cellular roaming while
overseas. Cellphones Direct, a UK service provider
who resells Vodafone Group airtime, plans to
introduce its cellular ceiling plan in February,
despite customer concern to the plan.  Vodafone and
Cellnet, as network operators, are not responsible
for the charges placed by its reseller agents who
deal direct with members of the public.

LONDON, UK- According to a tribunal arranged by the
UK government's Customs & Excise department, food and
drink ordered by computer screen should be zero-rated
for VAT (value added tax) purposes. Presently all
food ordered is subject to 17.5% VAT. The tribunal
was hearing a case featuring Emphasis which provides
an E-Meal service whereby sandwiches, drinks and
confectionary are ordered by computer for delivery.
The tribunal was told that as the food was ordered it
should be classified as catering and thus be zero-rated.

LONDON, UK- The British government has confirmed that
police are empowered to search and read electronic
mail messages sent by companies and private
individuals.  Michael Howard, home secretary,
confirmed that the 1985 Interception of
Communications act does cover electronic mail and as
such allows authorised interception of e-mail
messages.  UK-based Internet service providers would
be forced to provide assistance to police upon
provision of a properly-executed warrant, however
observers note that there would be problems placing
warrants on systems hosted outside of the UK-- such
as CompuServe.

-MET POLICE INTRODUCE TRUNKED RADIO ROLL-OUT

TWW-2 January 1996-MET POLICE INTRODUCE TRUNKED RADIO
ROLL-OUT
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- The Metropolitan Police has started the
rollout of its new force-wide trunked radio service
known as Metradio. The service is being rolled out on
a sector-by-sector basis and the Met hopes for all of
 1 Area' to be on the system by the end of February. 
Once the programme of installation is eventually
completed, over 18,000 operational officers will be
using the UHF-based trunked system.  Senior officers
say that the network will provide a number of
benefits to policing including secure communications,
better speech quality, pooling of frequencies,

-FEARS GROW OVER UK TELEPHONE BANKING SERVICE

TWW-2 January 1996-FEARS GROW OVER UK TELEPHONE
BANKING SERVICE
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

LONDON, UK- British banking unions are becoming ever
concerned over the growth in telephone banking
services, claiming that new experiments could leave
High Street branches out in the cold. The National
Westminster Bank is trialing a system where customers
calling a local branch are switched to a central
answering centre and routine queries are dealt with
by staff linked to computer systems.  Officials say
that if the scheme is implemented, millions of staff
will be moved over to the cheaper service.  Peter
Haines, a spokesman of the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union, said: "We are worried that it could be
used as a back-door way of phasing out all local
branches.  NatWest denied that it had plans to phase
out branches, saying that they remain a critical part
of their business plan.

COUNCIL
TELECOMWORLDWIRE--(C) 1995 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

BRUSSELS, BELGIUM- In a bid to champion the return of
the typewriter, a city borough council in Brussels is
planning to introduce a tax in the workplace. The
voted measure will see an annual GBP12 levy made on
every computer in central Brussels area and companies
will be forced to display a licence sticker as proof
of payment.  The tax law does not say what provisions
need to be made for laptop computers. Incredibly, a
number of inspectors are being appointed to police
the licensing process.  The city's finance department
used the argument that computers take away jobs and
hence it is acceptable to place a tax on them. Around
GBP1m is expected to be raised by the tax.  A number
of offices whose property falls between the city
borough where taxes are enforced and another local
tax-free borough has considered shifting all of its
computers to the other end of the office block in
order to save money.

TOKYO, JAPAN- Senior Japanese officials have hinted
that the government is planning to introduce a
widescale liberalisation of the country's
telecommunications marketplace.  Issel Inoue,
minister for posts and telecommunications, has said
that in principle barriers between local and long-
distance telecomms operations and between domestic
and international will be removed.  Japan's market is
hindered by a number of different regulations that
prohibit market cross-entry and these are to be
lifted with a new set of fairness regulatory models
inserted in their place to protect smaller companies
from being impacted by larger competitors.  No time
span has been mooted for the new regime, however.

LONDON, UK- Hutchison Orange, operators of a UK PCN
service, has changed the way they distribute products
to the channel, much to the chagrin of retailers.  A
range of new and existing handsets are now being made
available to dealers at full trade prices with
commission paid upon connection.  When Orange first
launched it sold units at net prices to dealers who
then sold on mark-up. The company claimed that it was
breathing a breath of fresh air into the cellular
marketplace although it denies that it has made a
sudden about turn.   Orange dealers will also be able
to earn extra commission by signing up customers to
higher price plans, based on marketing support
programmes and gimmicky offers.  "Orange if convinced
these proposals will ensure the competitiveness of
the trade proposition for 1996, building on the
excellent results seen since the launch of Orange,"
claimed Gareth Jones, group director of sales.

LONDON, UK- America Online is making a move into the
UK market. AOL claims to be the largest online
service provider -- although so does with CompuServe
with around 4m customers -- and it believes that it
can make a dent in the UK market despite arriving
many years after CompuServe first pitched camp. AOL
will be bringing exclusive British content for its
online service as well as the usual range of Internet
services and resources.  Pricing has yet to be
determined although it is expected to be comparable
to the US service.  The company is keen to point out
that it is not just marketing its US service with a
few extras into the UK, instead preferring to produce
the best of its US output with great UK and European
content. America Online has seen its move scrutinised
by the European Commission's anti-competitive
officials because of its planned alliance with
Bertelsmann and Deutsche Telekom.

INDIA- UNCERTAINTIES FORCE TELCOS TO SEEK
ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES

Australia's Telstra is among foreign telecommunication companies
which have decided to alter their investment strategy in India
following the debacle over the awarding of licences to run basic
services in 20 regional circles.

On 1 January Telstra, along with significant industry players such as
AT&T and US West, failed to re-submit bids for basic service
licences. Only six consortia submitted bids for licences in five
circles. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had earlier
reopened the tender for 13 licences following the notification of
minimum bids prices (TNA November 30, 1995).

Paul Rea, a Telstra spokesman, told Telenews Asia that although
India remains a priority area for investment, DoT's minimum price of
$US2.5 billion for the Tamil Nadu circle was too much. Also, the
present uncertainties discouraged a resubmission for a basic
services licence. Rea said that "Telstra was not prepared to seek the
licence at any price". So instead Telstra would pursue alternative
investment strategies.

Telstra's alternative strategies include joining other international
carriers, with Indian partners, in managing basic regional
telecommunication services. Rea confirmed that Telstra has been
approached by foreign telcos to join them in partnerships; he was
not prepared to say which companies. Rea did point out, however,
that Telstra has appointed a senior executive, Dr Sanjay Modak, to
head up its New Delhi office. Modak's appointment indicates that
Telstra considers India one of its most important overseas
investment areas, according to Rea.

Other investment strategies open to Telstra include building its
technology transfer relationship with C-Dot and focusing more on
cellular services (see story below).

The uncertainties referred to by Rea include India's largest
opposition party, the Bharatiaya Janata Party, which is widely tipped
to win April general elections, threatening to cancel Congress-
awarded telecommunications licences (TNA December 14, 1995)
and eight separate Supreme Court petitions which seek to
invalidate the DoT's authority to award licences. The petitions relate
to the failure of the Congress government to establish a
telecommunications regulatory body before opening the
telecommunications sector to foreign investment (TNA September
7, 1995).

On 9 January the Court postponed until 16 January a hearing into
the petitions. Until the Court rules on the petitions DoT remains
powerless to award licences to any consortium. DoT had earlier
notified a Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd-led consortium
that it had won four licences and a Hughes-led consortium that it
had won one licence (TNA November 30, 1995).

The six consortia willing to meet the DoT's minimum licence fee
were: Bell Canada/Tata with $US1.2 billion in Andhra Pradesh;
NTT/Goekna with $US3.2 billion in Tamil Nadu; Bell Atlantic/Essar
with $US1.3 billion in Punjab; Nynex/Reliance with $US0.9 billion
in Gujarat; Moscow Telecom/Usha with $US0.7 billion in Bihar. A
Stet/Bharti consortium also submitted a bid for Punjab.

The DoT received no bids for Kerala, West Bengal, Assam, Madhya
Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Orissa, eastern Uttar Pradesh, the
Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the north-east region.

Meanwhile, the BJP-led state government of Maharastra has
cleared the US power company Enron to resume work on the
$US920 million first stage of a power project which represents the
largest ever foreign investment in India. Enron's difficulties with the
nationalist-BJP have been keenly watched by foreign investors in
India as a test case should the BJP win overall government in April.

INDIA - GOVERNMENT SET TO APPROVE PARTNER SWAPPING

The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) looks set to approve
a proposal by Modicom Networks Ltd to replace the US' Vanguard
Cellular with Australia's Telstra as equity partner in running cellular
services in Karnataka and Punjab.

The proposal comes after DoT announced on 12 December that it
had awarded 18 licences to run cellular services in regional areas.
The Modi group currently holds 51 percent equity in Modicom, with
Vanguard holding 26 percent and Thailand's Telecom Asia holding
the remaining 23 percent.

If Modicom's proposal is accepted it will likely encourage other
Indian-led consortia to swap foreign partners in equity
arrangements for both cellular and basic service licences. A DoT
source told Telenews Asia that while the DoT had received no other
applications from cellular licencees to change their foreign partners,
there have been informal enquiries.

Koshika Telecom and a Hinduja/HCL consortium are both looking
for new foreign partners to replace Philippino Telecom and
Singapore Telecom. Koshika has cellular licences in Orissa, Bihar,
Uttar Pradesh east and Uttar Pradesh west. Hinduja/HCL has a
Tamil Nadu cellular licence.

Meanwhile, Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd (HFCL) failed
to meet the first instalment for its cellular licence fee for Gujurat. The
$US47 million fee was due on 12 December. HFCL is the subject of
Supreme Court actions over the high licence fees it quoted to run
basic telecommunication services.

Sources in HFCL told Telenews Asia on 5 January that the cellular
licence fees will be paid within a few days. A DoT official told
Telenews Asia that licences would not be revoked as a result of late
payment but a late fee of Rp2 million ($US57,000) per day would be
charged. JT Mobile, Hinduja/HCL, BPL/US West, Hexacom and
Aircell also failed to make their first licence fee instalments on time.

CHINA - ARMY TO BUILD NATIONAL PAGING NETWORK

A commercial unit of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), China
Electronics System Engineering Co (CESEC), is planning a new
nationwide public radio paging network in association with foreign
joint venture partner Hutchison Telecommunications (Hong Kong)
Ltd, according to Canning Fok, group managing director of parent
company Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.

CESEC is also due to launch a public AMPS network in Nanjing
during January, under a separate joint venture arrangement with
Hutchison, according to Fok. Hutchison has already invested in 15
small paging networks in the Nanjing military region.

If CESEC goes ahead with its paging project, it will be up against
tough competition from hundreds of private, regional post and
telecommunications authorities and state sector networks, not least
the Singapore Telecom-backed Beijing Asia Pacific First Star
Communications Technology Co Ltd which plans to inaugurate its
own national paging system in the middle of 1996 - about a year
later than planned.

Hutchison has a 51 percent stake in the company installing the
Nanjing cellular network, which will have initial capacity for 10,000
subscribers. The network will be operated by CESEC in deference
to China's prohibition on foreign direct investment in
telecommunication services. Fok said that he believed the network
would likely be upgraded to CDMA in future and discussions are
already in progress to integrate the Nanjing system into the PLA's
other public cellular networks being installed in China's coastal
provinces (TNA July 27, 1995).

A third joint venture with Hutchison has been formed with CESEC to
develop trunked radio services in China. Fok declined to elaborate
as the projects were still in the early planning stages.

Hutchison is not the first foreign player to consider offering finance
and technical expertise for the PLA's cellular network in Nanjing.
Star Paging and AT&T were among foreign operators previously
courted to build a system there, but successive attempts to launch
services failed because of the reluctance of the local
telecommunications authorities to provide PSTN access.

However a policy shift by the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications in late 1995 enabled CESEC to start offering
public cellular services and these will be extended to 15 cities by
the end of 1996 using its national allocation of 10 MHz of AMPS A
band spectrum, previously reserved for military use, and a
combination of analogue AMPS and TDMA networks.

CHINA - GUANGDONG NEEDS FOREIGNERS FOR BROADBAND
NETWORK

Guangdong province plans to invest $US24 billion within 15 years
to construct a broadband telecommunications network and needs
foreign participation, according to the China Daily.

The newspaper quotes a Guangdong Post and
Telecommunications official, Liu Kejun, as saying that in order to
develop the broadband communications network, foreign investors
are "welcome to participate" in equipment purchase, leasing, and
personnel training.

Liu said that because the central government has not defined
policies on foreign participation in broadband technology there are
likely to be more opportunities available than with basic
telecommunication services. Watching for the huge market potential
of China's telecoms, many foreign companies, therefore, are
making efforts to enter this sector, hoping to participate in network
operations, Liu said.

However, Liu suggested that broadband network operations should
still be controlled by the government's posts and
telecommunications administrations, while broadband business
services could be run by other organisations, including foreign
companies.

Liu also suggested that telecommunications-related laws and
regulations need to be perfected, and that the government should
maintain good coordination between broadband network operators
and service providers. The establishment of an "information
superhighway" is a key to competition among countries in the next
several years, he said.

CHINA - MOTOROLA WINS RIGHT TO PROVIDE CDMA
CELLULAR & FIXED WIRELESS SYSTEMS

Motorola's Cellular Infrastructure Group and Xi'an Datang
Telephone Co have signed a MoU to provide cellular and wireless
local loop (WLL) base station and switching equipment to the China
market.

The MoU includes Motorola's CDMA technology and Datang
Telephone Co's SP30 super switching equipment.

The Minister of Post and Telecommunications, Wu Jichuan, the
vice-governor of Shaanxi Province, Fan Xiaomei, and the executive
vice president and general manager of Motorola, Jack Scanlon,
signed the MoU in Beijing on 22 December.

As part of the arrangement, Motorola will provide technical support
to Datang Telephone Co for the development and certification of
industry standard open interfaces for cellular and WLL applications.
These interfaces ensure the compatibility of switching and radio
sub-systems. The arrangement between Motorola and Datang
focuses on IS-634 for CDMA applications and V5.2 for WLL.

Xi'an Datang Telephone Co is a high technology enterprise
engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sales of
telecommunications products. The SP30 super switching system
was developed by Datang Co.

Motorola will ship more than 1,000 commercial CDMA cell sites
worldwide by year end 1995. Motorola supplied CDMA
infrastructure equipment for the world's first commercial CDMA
network launch in Hong Kong in September 1995.

INDONESIA - FOREIGN COMPANIES READY TO EXPAND
REGIONAL NETWORKS

Indonesia's telephone subscribers, especially those living in remote
areas, can expect to see the beginning of big changes during 1996
as foreign companies take over the expansion of the regional
telecommunications network.

The state carrier, PT Telkom, has begun handing over the
management of five designated regions under the terms of joint
operating contracts (KSOs) signed before the partial float of PT
Telkom in November 1995 (TNA November 2, 1995).

Networks in Sulawesi, Irian Jaya, Maluku and Nusa Tenggara have
reportedly already been handed over while those in Ujangpandang
and South Sulawesi are in transition. Other networks in Sumatra,
West Java, Central Java and Kalimantan are set to change hands
by the middle of January.

The KSOs are the key to a government plan to add five million
telephone lines to the Indonesian telecommunications system by
the end of 1999.

A spokesman for Pramindo Ikat Nusantara, which is to operate the
Sumatra KSO, outlined the company's plans in an interview with
The Jakarta Post saying that it would take over the management of
600,000 existing lines in Sumatra and install a further 516,487.

The spokesman said that 7000 Telkom employees would join
Pramindo which is 59 percent owned by PT Astratel Nusantara, a
subsidiary of the Indonesian Astra International group, 35 percent
owned by France Cable et Radio, a subsidiary of France Telecom,
with a further six percent owned by Primkopparpostel, a cooperative
of the employees of the Ministry of Tourism, Post and
Telecommunications and PT Intertel Pratama Media.

According to the spokesman, Telkom's regional division office in
Medan will become a KSO unit and will maintain the old billing
system for existing subscribers. The company's investment in the
project is estimated to be $US70 million.

He said that the company was still negotiating with potential
partners, among them were Marubeni Corp and Nichimen of Japan,
the International Finance Corp, a World Bank affiliate and the
Commonwealth Development Corp of Britain, although there would
need to be government approval before new names could be
added to the KSO shareholders.

On another front, the government has said that it will drop sanctions
against PT Daya Mitra Malindo if it settles its internal conflicts over
its KSO contract in Kalimantan.

The company had problems sealing the deal with the government
for its KSO project because of a dispute between the partner
companies, one of them being the state-owned PT Telkom.

The executive director of Telekom Malaysia, Said Ali, told the
Indonesian Observor in December that his company was still
negotiating "crucial matters" concerning the term of the cooperation
agreement with PT Mitra Malindo (TNA December 14, 1995).

INDONESIA - HIGH PAGER USE STRETCHES PUBLIC
TELEPHONE NETWORK

The Government has dramatically revised upward its estimate of the
number of pager users in Indonesia and is concerned about the
shortcomings of the nation's public telephone network as a result.

As a way to deal with the problem the Government is considering
handing over to the private sector the management of public
telephones outside Jakarta in the hope that private operators would
install more phones and improve old ones, according to the Minister
of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications, Joop Ave.

Joop said in a statement that a single company - probably a small
one - would be chosen. He did not mention whether the Jakarta
public telephone network, which is also under heavy strain and
plagued by maintenance problems, would be upgraded.

Joop's statement of his preference for a small operator to take over
the management of the regional phone network follows earlier
pronouncements from the government that small and medium sized
businesses were to be given a break in the allocation of
government contracts (TNA September 7, 1995).

The Department of Tourism, Post and Telecommunications has
already allowed smaller companies to operate as providers of
Internet and pager services.

According to Joop, there has been a big increase in demand for
public telephones because of the large number of Indonesians who
carry and receive messages on pagers but do not have a personal
telephone.

Joop said that the number of national pager operators had
increased from two to eight in two years and that the number of
customers using paging services had reached 500,000. He also
said that 90 new regional pager licences would be issued - none of
them in Jakarta.

Joop said that he had adjusted the government's target for the sixth
Five Year Development Plan period to allow three million pager
customers by 1999 instead of the earlier estimate of one million.

One of the largest pager operators, PT Buana Bintangbayu, which
operates paging services in seven Indonesian cities and has big
expansion plans, is negotiating with Singapore Telecom to provide
international roaming services.

Buana Bintangbayu, a joint venture between PT Telekomindo
Primabahakti and Mitsui Co, has said that it plans to include other
foreign partners in its business, such as companies based in
Malaysia and Thailand.

% PT Telekomindo is to build 50 radio basestations in Jabotek
(greater Jakarta; including the satellite cities of Bogor, Tangerang
and Bekasi) as it prepares to become the third biggest
telecommunications company servicing the Indonesian
marketplace. PT Telekomindo vice-director, Peter Djatniko, said that
Jabotek's increasing demand for telecommunications indicates a
huge potential for growth. It is predicted that the Jabotek area will
need more than 600,000 cellular and fixed telephone lines within
the next three years.

% PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Inti), one of Indonesia's
strategic government-owned industries, has been granted a digital
cellular telecommunications licence, according to a statement by
the telecommunications minister, Joop Ave. However, few details
are available about the terms of the licence for the West Java-based
company. There are currently two analogue and one digital mobile
cellular phone systems operating in Indonesia.

% Arianespace, in a bid to capture more of the world's satellite
launch business, has deployed more marketing personnel in Asia
than any other region of the world, according to Jacques Roelandts,
manager of Arianespace Tokyo. Speaking at the Langkawi
International Maritime and Aerospace '95 show in Malaysia,
Roelandts said that Arianespace uses one sales manager for every
two Asian countries whereas for the rest of the world it was one for
every four or five countries. Indonesia plans to launch two satellites
with Arianespace - the Palapa C-2 in March and one for Indostar
during 1997.

% PT Mobilkom Telekomindo will operate 22 basestations for radio
trunking in cities on the island of Java by February. So far the
company has invested $US25 million and has plans to spend
another $US75 million on more base stations next year in Java, Bali
and Sumatra.

% Information technology company PT Metrodata Electronics has
entered into a 40:60 joint venture with Singapore-based Datacraft
Asia to set up a telecommunications company in Indonesia.
According to a Datacraft statement, the joint venture company will
have the support of Datacraft's Singapore marketing and technical

THAILAND - TARIFF CUTS TO ENCOURAGE BROADER MOBILE
SUBSCRIBER BASE

Reductions in mobile telephone network service charges and pager
fees will cut Bt2200 million ($US87.3m) from government agency
revenues but are expected to boost subscriber demand.

The reductions, following a government directive, will cut Telephone
Organisation of Thailand (TOT) revenues from mobile network
service charges by Bt1000 million ($US39.6m) and pager revenue
by Bt500 million ($US19.8m).

The Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT) will lose Bt400
million ($US15.87m) from mobile network service charges and
Bt300 million ($US11.9 million) from pager revenue.

The 27 percent cut in revenue share by government agencies from
1 January has already fuelled campaigns by five pager network
operators operating under government concessions to broaden
their customer base. Most are planning big marketing campaigns,
network expansion and the introduction of new, cheaper models of
pagers in anticipation of a 20 percent growth in demand during
1996.

A Bt500 ($US19.8) monthly service fee paid by cellular network
subscribers will later this month be cut to Bt400 ($US15.8), in
keeping with the government's policy to reduce mobile telephone
costs and improve services.

Negotiations are now underway between government agencies and
mobile network operators Total Access Communication Plc and
Advanced Information Service Plc to reduce air time fees from
blocks of one minute costing Bt3 ($US0.10) to 20 second blocks.

The CAT has also asked the TOT to cancel the domestic telephone
access charge of Bt200 ($US7.9) a month in light of the service fee
reduction.

PHILIPPINES - POWER COMPANY FINALISES PLANS FOR FIBRE
OPTIC CABLE BACKBONE

The state-owned National Power Corp (Napocor) has finalised its
plans to put up a $US83.86 million fibre optic cable backbone and
lease the facility to the Telecommunications Infrastructure Corp of
the Philippines (Teleophil) consortium.

Napocor president, Guido Delgado, told Telenews Asia that the
plan would soon be submitted to the Napocor board for approval.

The cable project, otherwise known as the national digital
transmission network (NDTN), will be completed within one year
and will interconnect the power company's Luzon, Visayas and
Mindanao grids. It will be 2,300 kilometres long and pass through
all the nation's major cities.

Delgado also said that Teleophil will lease Napocor's dark fibre and
absorb the cost of terminal equipment.

Teleophil is investing $US150 million in the NDTN to compete with
the Philippine Long Distance Telephone company's (PLDT) existing
backbone. In November Teleophil announced that because the
eight participants in the consortium each have individual authority
from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to
operate as carriers the consortium will not have to apply to the
Congress for a franchise for the project, an obstacle which has
bedevilled Belltel's attempt to become the major competitor to
PLDT's nationwide monopoly of services (TNA November 30,
1995). Telenews Asia understands that by tacitly approving the
Teleophil strategy the NTC has removed many of Belltel's obstacles
as well.

Meanwhile, Italy's Pirelli Construction Co has offered to finance the
Napocor project. According to Frolian Tamonpinco, Napocor's
corporate planning group manager, Pirelli is also interested in a
supply agreement with Napocor for the cable project.

Delgado said that Teleophil will realise savings because the power
company will charge only a fraction of the $US2.30 per-circuit-
kilometre lease charge. He also said that there is no need to form a
telecommunications subsidiary because the project is only an
added business for Napocor.

PHILIPPINES - PLDT SATELLITE FACES DELAY

The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT)-led Mabuhay
Philippines Satellite Corp may suffer delays in the launching of its
satellite because of a conflict involving Indonesia and Japan over
orbital slot allocation.

The conflict involves the acquisition of the 144 degrees-east orbit
location to be used by the Japanese Superbird satellite and the
Mabuhay in partnership with the Pasik Satelit Nusantara (PSN) of
Indonesia.

The Mabuhay consortium, which also includes PSN, had earlier
abandoned a co-registration with the Philippine government and
instead opted to utilise an Indonesian-registered slot to launch its
satellite by November 1996.

In a letter to Japanese deputy minister for policy coordination,
Yoshio Utsumi, the telecommunications undersecretary, Josefina
Lichauco, said that the acquisition of the orbital slot of Mabuhay's
rival - the Philippine Agila Satellite Inc - applied for a 147-degree
east degree slot, which may have possible interference with the 144
degree east proposed slot of Japan and Indonesia.

Indonesia is undertaking coordination meetings with Japan
because Japan filed an application for the slot ahead of Indonesia
with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) for Ku-band,
or broadcast operations using, the 144-degree east location.

Indonesia upgraded its application in November 1994 to cover C-
band, or telecommunications operations, and Ku-band operations
using 144-degree east.

The Philippine government, however, had three months earlier, filed
for a 147-degree east slot for both C-band and Ku-band operations
on behalf of the Agila consortium.

Indonesia is therefore required to coordinate with the Philippine
government on possible interference with the Agila project. The
Philippines, similarly has to coordinate with Japan.

"Japan was not aware of the plans to add Ku-band to the Palapa
Pacific filings, and Indonesia was not aware of the Japanese
intention to move N-Sat-146 from 146-degrees east to 144-degrees
east", Lichauco said, citing delays at the ITU in the publication of the
information submitted by each administration.

The communications official said that it the intention of the
Philippines government to write to the Indonesian government
informing them of the Philippine position.

Meanwhile, Mabuhay has increased its capital stock to P1 billion
($US38 million) from P320 million ($US12m), according documents
submitted to the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission
on 9 January.

PHILIPPINES - STATE CARRIER SIGNS INTERCONNECT DEALS

The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) is set to sign
three more interconnection agreements with telecommunication
companies after signing an interim agreement with Isla
Communications Co Inc (Islacom) on 10 January. The agreement
will pave the way for the interconnection of their respective phone
networks.

The agreement is the sixth PLDT has signed with its competitors
and allows PLDT's competitors to piggy-back on PLDT's nationwide
network, saving them time and the cost of building their own
telecom backbone.

The interconnection allows direct dial access for subscribers of
PLDT and Islacom, doing away with operator assistance.

Islacom is a joint venture between Asiacom Philippines and
Thailand's Shinawatra International.

Late in 1995 PLDT signed interconnect deals with Globe Telecom,
International Communications Corp, Philippine Telephone/Capitol
Wireless and Digital Telecommunications Philippines.

Agreements with Smart Communications, Eastern
Telecommunications and Major Telecom are expected within the
next few days.

PLDT vice-president, Nestor Virata, said that new players will share
in the cost of interconnection facilities on a 50:50 basis within each
of the new telecommunication company's service areas. However
the cost for calls made outside of the new companies service areas
but still within Metro Manila will depend on the traffic of total number
of calls.

Outside Metro Manila, calls will be charged based on the regular toll
sharing arrangements adopted with the members of the Philippine
Association of Private Telephone Companies. Virata told Telenews
Asia that the companies had agreed on a tentative flat rate of P800
($US30.5) per month.

AUTRALIA - SECOND CARRIER STALLED BY ENVIRONMENTAL
LOBBY

Plans by Australia's second carrier, Optus Communications, to
break Telstra's monopoly on the local loop by installing an above
ground network capable of delivering pay TV and telephony is
facing stiff opposition on environmental grounds.

In 1995 Optus Communications, the licenced second carrier, set up
a joint venture company, Optus Vision, with US cable TV operator
Continental Cablevision and Kerry Packer's Publishing and
Broadcasting Ltd to install a hybrid fibre co-axial network which
would deliver pay TV and telephony. Optus Vision secured
agreements from a number of power utilities for access to their
above ground distribution network and has been installing cables
on power poles in Australian suburbs for several months. Pay TV
services commenced on the network late in 1995.

Telstra retaliated by forming a joint venture with News Ltd, Foxtel, to
offer pay TV services and installing its own hybrid fibre coaxial
network, but initially for pay TV only. Telstra, however is primarily
using its existing network of underground ducts to install its cable.

Both carriers enjoy exemption from local government planning
requirements but are required to consult with councils and the local
community under a telecommunications national code before
installing and telecommunications infrastructure.

A number of councils have objected to Optus Vision's unsightly
above ground cables and have initiated legal action accusing the
company of breaching the code in its handling of the consultation
process.

The councils scored their first victory in late December when a
judge in the Victorian Supreme Court granted a temporary
injunction restraining Optus Vision from further cabling in the city of
Boroondara. The judge found that the provisions of the Federal
Telecommunications Act which grant exemption are so wide as to
create widespread uncertainty in their application. The council's
lawyer had argued that the exemptions could even be invoked to
grant Optus employees exemption from state speed limits. The
judge also said it was arguable that the exemptions, granted to the
carrier Optus Communications, could not be claimed by its Optus
Vision subsidiary.

The code was due for review before mid 1997 as part of a policy to
end the Optus Telstra duopoly and open up the market to greater
competition and Communications Minister Michael Lee announced
on 20 December that the exemption from state and local
government planning rules would be removed.

However critics of the government say that this will be too late.
Telstra and Optus are racing to build their networks as fast as
possible in the belief that the first network in an area will have a
strong advantage and deter the competitor from duplicating it.

Telstra has repeatedly insisted that it would not be practicable to
permit Optus to share its cable ducts, but the government is coming
under increasing pressure to force it to do so or make some other
policy change to halt what many see as an unnecessary and costly
duplication of infrastructure.

AUSTRALIA - DRAFT OF NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT
RELEASED

The Australian Government has released a for-comment draft of
new telecommunications legislation that will come into effect in July
1997. It will replace the current 1991 legislation which ended the
government owned carrier's monopoly on basic services in favour
of liberal resale and a duopoly on basic services.

The draft comprises two main items of legislation, the
Telecommunications Bill 1996 and the Trade Practices
(Telecommunications) Amendments Bill 1996.

The new Telecommunications Bill will remove almost all barriers to
entry into all telecommunications services but will limit the market
power of the incumbents by instituting access codes under which
they will be obliged to make their networks available to competitors.

Under the draft bill legislative control on competition will be shifted
into general competition law under the Trade Practices Act,
administered by the newly formed Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission (ACCC) the necessary amends to that Act
are contained in the Trade Practices (Telecommunications)
Amendments Bill 1996.

Separate legislative provisions will apply to service providers and
carriers. Anyone will be able to become a service provider but may
be declared a carrier by the ACCC against criteria set out in the
telecommunications bill. Any service provider with substantial
control over customers through its own switches is likely to be
declared a carrier, even if it does not own any transmission
infrastructure.

A carrier will be required to give undertakings to provide access to
its services and facilities in accordance with codes and standards.

The draft legislation is based on a set of 99 proposals developed by
the Department of Communications and the Arts and released on 1
August 1995 (TNA August 10 1995). Co-incident with the release of
the draft legislation, the government issued a further 39 proposals.

The additional proposals seek to minimise government control over
technical regulation which will be "primarily addressed through
industry self regulation involving affected groups including
consumers". However the industry regulator, to be formed by the
merger of Austel and the Spectrum Management Agency, will have
a reserve power to mandate standards where appropriate or where
self regulation fails.

Standards will be required to be based on international and
regional standards unless this is inappropriate. Carriers and service
providers will be free to develop their own network standards but
these must be co-ordinated with interconnection, customer
equipment and cabling standards.

The controversial Telecommunications National Code under which
the existing carriers enjoy protection from state and local
government planning requirements will be reviewed and carriers
will cease to have power to override planning rules.

The draft bills are open for comment until 16 February 1996.

NEW ZEALAND - TELECOM NZ PAY TV PLAN STYMIED BY
LEGAL ACTION

The battle between New Zealand carriers Clear Communications
and Telecom New Zealand over pay TV escalated in late December
when Clear successfully gained an injunction preventing Telecom
New Zealand from proceeding on plans to conclude a pay TV
programming agreement with Sky Television.

Telecom NZ is planning to wire 6000 homes in the country's two
largest cities, Auckland and Wellington to deliver pay TV and
broadband services and has tried to gain programming through the
agreement with Sky. Clear had earlier challenged Telecom NZ's
plan to acquire the 25 percent of Sky shares held by its own major
shareholders, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech. Clear argued that such
an acquisition would create a dominant player in the telephony and
pay TV industries. Clear has not indicated any intention to enter the
pay TV or local loop telephony markets.

Clear lawyers were granted access to the confidential programming
agreement and claimed that it constituted a serious breach of the
country's fair trading legislation, the Commerce Act.

The injunction preventing the agreement proceeding until a further
hearing was granted on 21 December. Telecom NZ says it will
defend the action. Its share acquisition plan is dependent on the
programme sharing agreement, and so has also been put on hold.

SRI LANKA - DEUTSCHE MORGAN GRENFELL APPOINTED FOR
TELECOM PRIVATISATION

The government has appointed a five member consortium led by
German investment bank Deutsche Morgan Grenfell to advise on
the restructuring and privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT).

The Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Managala
Samaraweera, said in a 9 January statement that the consortium
had been given until July to submit a proposal for the restructuring.
The government will then select a strategic partner and decide how
much of the company will be privatised.

Telenews Asia understands that initially 20 percent of SLT will be
privatised, however it is unclear as to what percentage will be open
for foreign investment. SLT holds a monopoly over all aspects of
telecommunications in Sri Lanka except cellular services. The
government's move to privatise SLT by the Public Enterprise
Reform Commission is opposed by Sri Lanka's trade unions who
want it to remain a fully government-owned enterprise.

Samaraweera also announced the government's plan to set up two
private telephone companies which will provide 200,000 wireless
telephone lines within the next four years. Samaraweera said that
more details on the companies will be released after 12 January.

The Deutsche Morgan Grenfell-led consortium includes Deloitte
Touche, Tohmatsu International, Slaughter and May and the
Development Finance Corp of Ceylon.

Meanwhile the chairman of SLT, Hemasiri Fernando, said that SLT
needs a SLRp20 billion ($US370 million) injection or it will run into
financial difficulties later in 1996. Fernando said that SLT had a
turnover of SLRp8 billion ($US150 million) in the 1994-5 financial
year, but profits were low. With 17.5 million people Sri Lanka has
200,000 telephone lines.

TAIWAN - PARLIAMENT PASSES PRIVATISATION LEGISLATION

Taiwan's parliament on 30 December finally passed legislation
which will lead to the privatisation of the Directorate General of
Telecommunications (DGT) within five years. The first step of the
process will be the complete privatisation of mobile phone and all
wireless telecommunication services. Domestic long distance
telephone services will be privatised after five years.

As the crucial bill was being passed about 4,000 DGT employees
tossed eggs and beer cans at the legislative building and
threatened to stage a strike. The vice premier, Hsu Li-teh, appealed
to the protesters for support, saying that the bill was crucial to
Taiwan's trade liberalisation.

Both the World Trade Organisation and GATT have made Taiwan's
membership conditional on the privatisation of the DGT (TNA
September 21, 1995). The government has promised the 36,000
employees that it will continue to employ the workers. However it
has rejected the protesters' demand for representation on the board
of directors of the new company.

In October the communication minister, Liu Chao-shiuan, told
parliament that paging services, mobile cellular services, mobile
data transmission, trunked radio communications and vsat services
will be opened to private Taiwanese and foreign partners as soon
as the relevant legislation passes parliament (TNA October 19,
1995).

Business Taiwan reports that at least 20 Taiwanese consortia and
international telecommunications enterprises have entered the race
to win licenses to run personal-communications services. The paper
quotes a DGT internal memo which says that the 1994 revenue from
mobile phone communications was around $NT20 billion ($US740
million). Even after deducting operating costs, the return on
investment was triple the operating costs.

Taiwanese companies that have reportedly expressed an intention
to bid for operating licenses include: Pacific Electric Wire & Cable
Co; Walsin Lihwa Electric Wire & Cable Co; President Enterprises
Group; Koo's Group; Taiwan Electrical and Electric Manufacturers'
Association; Vidar Sun Moon Star Co; Acer Inc; Fubon Insurance;
Chinese Automobile Co; Sin Kong Life Insurance Co; China Rebar
Co; and Taiwan Telecom Network Service Company.

International companies which have already arranged joint
ventures with Taiwanese companies include: BT, Vodafone,
Singapore Telecom, Hongkong Telecom, AT&T, McCaw Cellular
Communications, Bell South Corp and Bell Atlantic Corp.

One foreign telecommunications official is quoted as saying that
foreign companies assumed that the privatisation process would be
less open and they therefore used political considerations and
diplomatic influence rather than know-how to form alliances with
local companies.

However, the passage of the privatisation bill will now see the DGT
only issue licenses through financial bidding and therefore there
will be a free-for-all.

The DGT held a public hearing on 15 December to discuss
frequency allocation and decided to open the 900 MHz and 1,800
MHz frequencies to private mobile phone communications
operators, as well as frequencies between 284.5 MHz and 285.5
MHz to private paging communications operators.

For the mobile phone frequencies, 1,800 MHz will be open to
operators of digital systems while the 900 MHz frequency will be
open to operators of GSM systems.

DGT's initial plan is for the 1,800 MHz frequency to cover the entire
island, while the 900 MHz frequency can be either divided into three
regions or can cover the island. The government favours dividing
the band from 284.5 MHz and 285.5 MHz into three regions.

According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC)
statement, capitalisation of at least $NT2 billion ($US74 million) will
be required for a regional mobile phone operator and capitalisation
of at least $NT6 billion ($US222 million) will be needed for an
island-wide mobile phone operator.

For paging communications operators, capitalisation of at least
$NT200 million ($US7.4m) will be needed for regional operations
and capitalisation of at least of $NT400 million ($US15m) will be
needed for island-wide operations.

Pacific Electric Wire & Cable Co (PEWC) has criticised the form of
DGT privatisation, saying that it will favour large corporations. Lee
Ta-cheng, PEWC's president, says that bidding was an
irresponsible measure "because the student who makes the best
score in a contest may not be the richest student." Besides those
who win the bid with sky-high prices may try to get back their outlay
from their clients, according to Lee. "Although PEWC is also a
consortium, this method that benefits only consortia should be
changed."

MOTC officials responded that bidding is the fairest way for entrants
because it can prevent the authority in charge of the bid from being
lobbied, and because bidding can help increase national revenues.

Some experts predict that by 2000 Taiwan will be among the
world's top 10 mobile phone using countries. The mobile phone
population is currently 600,000, with a monthly increase of some
20,000 users. There are approximately two million pager users in
Taiwan, with a monthly increase of 30,000.

The first stage of the 27,000 kilometre, 120,000 circuit, Fibre optic
Link Around the Globe (Flag) has been laid between Italy and
Egypt.

Scheduled for completion in 1997, the Flag project will form a
broadband network between Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Asian landing sites have been finalised in India, Malaysia, Thailand,
Hong Kong, Korea and China.

Flag is jointly financed by Nynex, Dallah Al-Baraka of Saudi Arabia,
Thailand's Telecom Holding Co, Japan's Marubeni, Hong Kong's
Asian Infrastructure Fund and General Electric. On 10 January the
Flag board of directors appointed Joseph Timpanaro, a Nynex
senior vice president, as chairman and chief executive officer.

According to Timpanaro, more than 50 international carriers have
already bought circuits on Flag.

AT&T Submarine Systems and KDD Submarine cable Systems are
the contractors for Flag's installation (TNA October 6, 1994). Cable
& Wireless Marine has been subcontracted to install approximately
two thirds of the cable.

ministry covering 1,021 domestic telecommunications companies,
investment expectations were revised up from the 14 percent
increase that was predicted in a March 1995 survey. The upward
revision is in part traced to hefty spending on mobile
communications such as the PHS.

GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND THE LAST DECADE OF THE 20TH CENTURY

     With this New Year, we are entering the last decade of the
Twentieth Century--a century that has thrust upon us more change
and advancement of knowledge than all of the millennia of human
history that has gone before.  It is said, for example, that one
weekday edition of The New York Times contains more knowledge
than a man in the 16th century was exposed to in a lifetime.
     The beginning of this century saw the dawn of the
communications revolution: sending messages by both wire and
through the air.  In the last half of this century, we mastered
sending messages to space and back, and created a wholly new
medium: pulses of light rather than electricity.  We have filled
the air--the spectrum--with so much information that we are
challenged to find ways to increase the capacity of our radio
systems.
     Human culture, society and personality are all functions of
communication.  Thus, each advancement in our ability to
communicate alters the fabric of culture, society, and
personality.
     Christian Schwarz-Schilling, West Germany's minister of
posts and telecommunications, reflected this when he recently
told a luncheon audience in Washington:  "Whatever may have been
responsible for the onset of the democratic movements in Poland,
Hungary and East Germany, it can be said that this would not have
happened without telecommunications.  Without telecommunications,
information on the free West would not have penetrated the
communist countries, which were sealed off from the outer world
by barbed wire and walls.  Without telecommunications, the call
for freedom would not have spread so rapidly."
     As we enter this decade, we are about to radically alter our
planet.  The miracle of flight is credited with shrinking the
Earth...of compressing time.
     The miracle of telecommunications is beginning to do
something even more miraculous: it is eliminating time and
distance all together.  It is putting the entire community of man
in instant contact with one another, and will increase the
communal power to communicate, transact and inform.
     Most other industries that are international in scope only
import and export.  Goods are produced in one country and sold in
another.  There is a growing element of that type of
international business in telecommunications as well, but there
is another, more unique, aspect to telecommunications in the
"global village": the provision of global communications requires
partnering and cooperation to a far greater degree than mere
trading.
     Some of the events of 1989 foreshadow what the telecom
business climate of the next decade will become:
     MCI and the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. have already
agreed on a protocol, and are forming a joint venture to link
their videoconferencing networks.
     AT&T wants to expand telecom circuits between the Soviet
Union and the United States using Russia's Intersputnik satellite
system.  Last month, AT&T introduced direct dialing between the
United States and Moscow.
     AT&T, Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD), and British Telecom
introduced digital services among their 3 countries and entered
calling card billing agreements.  They are also offering
international ISDN.  The 3 companies continue to sign agreements
with carriers in other countries expanding this international
ISDN network.
     KDD has opened offices in New York and London.
     Voicecom is partnering with British Telecom to offer voice
messaging in the United Kingdom and Europe.
     Nynex International and the Telecommunications Authority of
Singapore have agreed to cooperate on joint marketing and
technical studies.
     U S West acquired CATV companies in the United Kingdom and
Hong Kong, and is in a joint venture with Magyar Posta to build a
cellular network in Hungary.
     Telefind signed an agreement with Japan Steel Works and has
affiliations in other countries around the world to create a
global paging network.
     PacTel is part of a consortium awarded a license to build
and operate a cellular system in West Germany.  BellSouth is in a
consortium that has inaugurated cellular mobile service in Buenos
Aires.
     The U.S. Commerce Department organized telecom trade
delegations to Zurich and Vienna in Europe, and to Mexico,
Colombia and Venezuela.  It also has slated its second Southeast
Asia Telecommunications Conference in Pattaya, Thailand from Feb.
26 to March 1, 1990.
     This list is just an example of thousands of new
international business arrangements, cooperative ventures, joint
ventures, and distribution agreements that have been formed by
telecommunications companies.  Such international ventures are
not limited to the multi-billion dollar companies in the
business.  Newbridge Networks, for instance, signed a
distribution agreement with Sumitomo; formed a joint venture with
the Soviet Ministry of Radio; and, in 2 years, became the second
largest supplier of multiplexers in Europe.  Farmstead
International has formed joint ventures in China to refurbish and
market AT&T central office switches.
     The process that will drive the next decade is a closed
loop: to increase international business and commerce requires
that we provide better international communications.  The act of
creating the infrastructure for better international
communications, in turn, increases international business.
     The technical pieces are all in place:
     Voice messaging eliminates the barriers of time zones.
     The digitization of telephone networks worldwide provides
the platform.  Hong Kong, for instance, plans to have a 100%
digital network in place by 1993.
     ISDN integrates all communications media for transport.
     Fiber optics exponentially decreases the cost per circuit.
     Technologies such as facsimile, E-mail, and text-to-speech
make it possible to integrate messaging media.
     Technologies like IMMC's Ultraphone and Solarex's solar
power sources for telecom mean that sophisticated communications
can be brought affordably to areas other than those of great
population density.
     Increased processing power at a lower cost, coupled with
incredibly sophisticated programming skills, will bring
instantaneous computerized translation to communications,
eliminating the final barrier between peoples--that of language.

     *TELEPHONE NEWS salutes its readers and industry for the
giant strides it has made in the last century, and for its
emerging global perspective today.  It is even possible that the
restrictions imposed on the regional Bell operating companies
will, in the future, turn out to be blessings.  Those RBOCs that
have turned to international opportunities may, in the long run,
be stronger than if more of their resources had been devoted to
the domestic markets from which they have been barred.
     Aside from commerce, this industry has bettered our life by
such acts as bringing the deaf into the world of the hearing, it
has saved lives with enhanced 911, and it has helped integrate
our disparate peoples with multi-lingual communications systems.
     In this, the final decade of the century, you will be
uniting the world through enhanced communications planet-wide,
and in doing so, will be fostering the good will and cooperation
among men that we wished one another this past holiday season.
     TELEPHONE NEWS and Phillips Publishing wish you a happy and
prosperous New Year, and resolve to bring you another year of
news, analysis and insight to further your endeavors.

U S WEST TO OFFER NEW, AFFORDABLE  E9-1-1

     U S West Communications said that it has  developed a new
telecom service which will allow affordable Enhanced 9-1-1 (E9-1-
1) to small and medium-sized communities.  The newly
announced service was developed over the past 2 years by U S West
Communications; U S West Advanced Technologies; Stratus
Computers; and Mitel.
     U S West will initially market the new E9-1-1 service in its
14-state service area after completing additional technical and
marketing trials.  The new architecture will also be available in
1990 to national and international customers for installation and
testing in trial sites.
     Current E9-1-1 service consists of networking that includes
facilities and routing of calls placed to 9-1-1; the database,
which includes every telephone number and service address in a
given 9-1-1 service area; and customer premise equipment (CPE).
In most cases, the database and networking portions of the
service are leased from the local telco, and are available only
through specific types of central offices (COs).  The answering
and dispatch centers, usually part of local police or government
operations, generally purchase the CPE equipment from a variety
of vendors.
     U S West Advanced Technologies developed proprietary
applications software to run the system, and Mitel's GX5000, with
a Host Command Interface protocol, provides the switching
functions.  The Stratus XA 2000 performs the necessary functions
to generate and translate information, tells the switch where to
direct the emergency phone call, and displays information about
the source of the call to E9-1-1 dispatch terminals.
U S WEST'S NEW E9-1-1 IS PORTABLE, USES ONLY 1 NETWORK, & LESS
EXPENSIVE CPE

     U S West's new E9-1-1 system contrasts from current E9-1-1
technology in that existing E9-1-1 systems require 2 separate
networks--one for voice and the caller's phone number--and the
second, a data network, retrieves and delivers the caller's
location information.  The new U S West E9-1-1 software
integrates both voice and data retrieval information into one
system, and then sends that information simultaneously to the
dispatch center.
     The new E9-1-1 platform will also allow customers to use
less expensive CPE in answering and dispatch centers.  CPE
requirements include a data terminal with 12 function keys, a
standard single line telephone, a notification device and a
printer.  In 1991, an optional interface for computer-aided
dispatching systems will be available from U S West.
     Lastly, the U S West service is portable and can be deployed
in any CO.  According to U S West, each service platform, or
feature node, will accommodate from below 30,000 subscriber lines
to over 300,000 lines, but the best economic results are realized
between 30,000 and 300,000 access lines.  Future plans include
multiple platforms that could be tied together--utilizing an
optional intertandem transfer feature--to support additional
lines.

INTERFACE WILL ALLOW NEW SERVICE TO WORK WITH ANY CO

     U S West filed its network disclosure statement with the FCC
in November and will begin an 8-month internal technical trial of
the service in Fremont County, Wyo., (county pop: 16,800)
beginning in May 1990.  The new E9-1-1 is scheduled for
deployment by U S West in its area during first-quarter 1991.
     "Inside our region, we will be marketing the system as a
turnkey solution," said Ken White, manager for public safety
product development for U S West Communications.  "Outside our
area, due to the MFJ, all U S West will be selling is the
software package, and we're still in the process of developing
co-marketing arrangements with systems integrators.  U S West
developed the software specifically for Stratus, and Mitel was
the only CO switch manufacturer that could give us an interface
to manipulate the service.
     "The transport costs between a small community and a CO can
be expensive.  Our new platform application puts service closer
to the community and reduces those transport charges.  Our
platform has been designed, but we are still in additional
development stages.  Once our optional interface is complete--
which should be around the end of the year or 1st quarter of
1991--we will be able to use the service in any CO.  Then we will
begin active and aggressive marketing.  The type of existing CO
will be inconsequential to deploying the service because of this
interface.  That's why this announcement is significant.
     "U S West has tested the service in our lab for the last 8
months, and it has past all feature and functionality tests with
flying colors," added White.  "But the medium must exist for the
system to correct itself and be remotely monitored.  In small
communities, COs are not monitored 24 hours a day, but liability
on 9-1-1 systems dictate that the system's heartbeat is monitored
full time, which will occur when the interface is deployed.
     "We've determined that there are 600 counties in our 14-
state area that are too small to afford current 9-1-1 technology
today.  That is the market that we are targeting."  (U S West
Communications, 1600 Seventh Ave., Room 3213, Seattle, WA 98191,
206/346-9998.)

INDIANA BELL TRIALING HOME ENERGY  MANAGEMENT TELECOM TECHNOLOGY

     Indiana Bell is providing the telecom technology that is
allowing Indiana Michigan (I&M) Power to conduct a 12-month
energy test program in Muncie, Ind.  The trial, involving 154 I&M
customers, could help consumers to manage their electricity
consumption more efficiently and lower their electric bills.
During the trial, test customers will use a special thermostat--a
TranstexT "Smart" unit developed by Johnson Controls--to measure
and adjust the amount of electricity used.  Indiana Bell's
network will permit 2-way communication of electrical consumption
and billing information between I&M and the 154 homes.
     The TranstexT thermostat will allow users to automatically
adjust the temperature on their electric heating/cooling systems
and water heaters at certain hours of the day, when electric
rates are higher or lower.  Indiana Bell's telephone lines and a
communications set in the customer's home will automatically
route the energy management information from the thermostat to
the electric utility's computer system and vice versa.  The
communication system will not affect customer use of the
telephone because the computer cannot transmit energy management
data if the telephone is in use.
     "This project is just one of many applications that will
allow consumers to more efficiently manage their energy use,"
said Pat Moss, Indiana Bell business manager.  "The data
transmitted over our network will help I&M determine how to
reduce the amount of electricity used during peak hours, thereby
lessening its need for expansion, and, in the long run, helping
its customers save money."  (Indiana Bell, 220 North Meridian
St., Indianapolis, IN 46204, 317/265-2583.)

SIEMENS RELEASES WORLD TELEPHONE STATS

     According to recent statistics compiled by Siemens, there
are approximately 455 million telephones in the world today.  The
statistics, the result of inquiries made to telecom
administrations worldwide, showed that citizens of the United
States use the telephone more frequently than others--an average
of 1,800 times a year per person.  Canada was a close second with
1,451; Denmark with 861; and the Australians with 593.
     The United States also had more telephones, 127 million,
followed by Japan with more than 50 million, and the Soviet Union
with approximately 28 million.  The telephone directories of the
world added 22 million new entries, for a total of 454 million
numbers--an increase of 5% over the previous year.  In Indonesia,
there are 30,000 people for every pay phone, contrasting with
only 100 per pay phone in Switzerland.  The Swiss place the most
international calls, an average of 28 per person.  The Belgians
are next with 12 times per person a year, and the Dutch third
with nearly 11.
     In 1987, the United States invested over $26 billion in
telecommunications, followed by Yugoslavia, which invested $15
billion.  The People's Republic of China added nearly 1 million
new telephones in 1987--an average of one telephone for every 100
people.  Turkey increased its telephones by nearly 50%, but still
has only 7.9 telephones per 100 people.  (Siemens Public Switch-
ing Systems, 900 Broken Sound Parkway, Boca Raton, FL 33487,

BELL-HAUN'S SUCCESS AND FUTURE BASED ON SERVICING DAYLIGHTS OUT
OF CUSTOMERS

     Tom Bell, CEO of Bell-Haun, a Westerville, Ohio-based
interconnect, and his partner, Mike Haun, met back in the mid-
'70s when they were both working in a large banking environment.
"Mike and I started up Bell-Haun basically as a hobby," said
Bell.  "Mike is the engineering part of our team and I'm the
front man.  We sold one system, then another, and by 1977 it was
pretty apparent that I could make sales rather quickly.  We also
did all the installations and have been a service-oriented
business right from the start.  "Our sales were based on
referrals from satisfied customers and now, some 12 or 13 years
later, they still represent a major source of our new business,"
added Bell.  Every 13 weeks Bell-Haun sends out a newsletter to
its' customers on company and product news.  "We get a lot of
positive feedback from the newsletters.  It helps to set us
apart, and gives us an edge."  The newsletter is also sent out
with proposals and to Bell-Haun's suppliers and vendors.
     "Bell-Haun is a service business.  Phones are phones.  The
difference in equipment is a difficult thing for a consumer to
see.  To us, the phone is a means to an end.  We sell the best
equipment available, but if all of those manufacturers go out of
business, we would still be around--we would just go to the
second best and still provide our customers with the best service
available.  We work very hard with our existing customer base
because a satisfied customer is the best lead to a new customer.
It gives us the inside track.
     "We focus on little things," said Bell.  "All of our
technicians wear uniforms supplied by the company, and all of our
vehicles are fleet maintained.  We try to follow the same
philosophy as UPS or Fed Ex.  Our office is located in a high-
rent area of the city, so when we bring clients to the office for
a demonstration, they see a stable, professional atmosphere.
They know that Bell-Haun is committed to its business.  That's
what we stand for.  Overall we use the soft sell approach yet we
want our presence felt," Bell added.  Bell-Haun is a 5-Star
Ameritech Dealer and handles Iwatsu, Mitel, and Motorola, and is
also a Centrex and data agent for Ohio Bell.
     "In 1985 we became an agent for Ameritech Mobile
Communications, and have installed over 8,000 cellular phones.
For the past 2 years, we have been working on what we call
Project '90 which focuses on voice messaging.  We see that as a
major new growth area for the company."  Bell-Haun is a
distributor of Teleconnect and AVT voice processing equipment.
"We want to position ourselves in the Columbus business community
as the answer to a customer's communications requirements."
Bell-Haun's customer base is between 4,000 and 5,000 but Bell
said that number was somewhat inflated because it includes
cellular only users.
     "We have always maintained an attitude that we want to be
the best.  Being the biggest is second to quality.  The
interconnect business has changed a lot during the 1980s, and it
will continue to change.  The emphasis on quality will only
increase.  I don't spend time watching competition, but I want my
people to know our competitor's systems.  I believe that the
successful company has to service the daylights out of a customer
to keep them your customer."  (Bell-Haun Systems, 935 Eastwind
Drive, Westerville, OH 43081, 614/882-4040.)

of Baltimore's mass transit system.  Last week Maryland's
Department of Transportation informed APC that its PCS system has
caused "serious interference" to the light rail and bus service
serving Baltimore and other metropolitan destinations.  The
letter had been circulated by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association--a Washington-based trade group that represents
several incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2
gigahertz band.  Today, UTC issued a statement retracting the
letter and acknowledging that it had been distributed without the
Transportation Department's consent.

Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, told TR that
APC plans to issue a complete statement tomorrow disputing the
claims outlined in the letter.  She said UTC's involvement was
suspect and expressed concern over the trade group's effort to
"politicize" the effort to relocate microwave incumbents in the
portion of the 2 GHz band allocated for the new PCS services. 
Ms. Schelle stated that previous interference problems with
Baltimore's mass transit system have been resolved.

The letter from Maryland's Transportation Department recounts two
occasions last fall when APC's PCS system disrupted
communications systems for Baltimore's mass transit operations. 
"These communications interruptions have posed a grave threat to
public safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated.  The Transportation
Department also asked APC to reimburse Maryland's Mass Transit
Administration (MTA) for all costs that it has incurred as a
result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Brown
declined to comment on the interference problems further, because
it involves "a possible issue of litigation."

AT&T ANNOUNCES $6 BILLION RESTRUCTURING PLAN INCLUDING
ELIMINATING 40,000 JOBS OVER 3 YEARS

ATT Corp. today announced a $6 billion restructuring as the next
step in its plan to break up into separate services,
systems-technology, and computer companies.  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert E. Allen told employees that
reorganizations planned to establish the separate telecom
services (New AT&T) and systems-technologies companies likely
would result in 30,000 layoffs.  AT&T announced plans today to
eliminate almost 40,000 jobs over the next three years, but that
figure includes more than 6,500 management employees who accepted
an early retirement offer (TR, Nov. 20, 1995) by year-end.  It
does not include the 8,500-job cut announced by AT&T Global
Information Solutions last September.  The computer unit took a
$1.17 billion posttax charge against third quarter earnings to
cover the costs of its separate restructuring.

AT&T said it may extend the voluntary separation offer to
additional employees of its services and systems-technologies
units, and Mr. Allen said such an extension would reduce the
number of job cuts to be achieved through layoffs.  He added that
about 4,000 of the jobs to be cut are in "businesses we plan to
sell."  Workers in those units should be able to keep their jobs
under new ownership, Mr. Allen said.  A company spokesman said
about 60% of the 40,000 jobs targeted for elimination over three
years are "in management categories."   AT&T plans to complete
about 70% of the job cuts this year, but other cuts will be
announced throughout the three-year period, a spokesman said. 
"We know the types and levels of jobs" to be cut, but "we won't
know specifics" for some time, he added.

AT&T said 6,000 to 7,000 jobs will be cut in New Jersey, where
the company currently employs about 48,000 persons.  Despite the
cuts, AT&T will maintain "a major presence" in New Jersey, where
headquarters for the new services and systems-technology
companies and major Bell Laboratories operations will continue. 
About 10,000 of the positions to be cut will be "corporate-wide
staff jobs in functions such as information systems, human
resources, and financial operations," AT&T said.  The remaining
cuts, which will occur in operating units of the two new
companies, will include about 6,000 "administrative and
back-office support positions," it added.  The "vast majority" of
the cuts will involve jobs in the U.S.

Communications Workers of America President Morton Bahr said the
job cut announcement will "demoralize" AT&T's workforce and set
back cooperative union-management programs under development
during the last three years.  "We didn't even receive the
courtesy of advance notification of today's mass cutback
announcement," Mr. Bahr said.  "So far we have no idea even how
many of CWA's 80,000 members at AT&T may be impacted by the
cutbacks, and apparently neither does AT&T.  I was informed by
the head of labor relations that it will take up to 60 days to
provide details on jobs and locations that will be affected."  A
CWA spokesman confirmed that meetings have continued between CWA
and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers officials and
their AT&T labor relations counterparts to discuss plans for the
breakup.  But CWA officials got no advance notice in the meetings
of today's cutback announcement, the spokesman said.  IBEW's
national offices in Washington were closed today for the New
Year's holiday.

To implement a complex restructuring that a spokesman said
involves hundreds of separate actions, AT&T will take a posttax
charge totaling about $4 billion or $2.50 per share against
fourth quarter 1995 earnings.  About $2.6 billion of the $6
billion pretax restructuring charge will cover severance pay and
other costs related to the workforce reductions.  An additional
$1.7 billion is earmarked to cover the costs of writing down the
value of certain assets, including unneeded network facilities
and investments in certain international units.  As an example of
such an investment write-down, AT&T cited its partnership
interest in the Canadian Unitel Communications, Inc., competitive
long distance operation.  AT&T and three Canadian banks agreed
last fall to invest up to $250 million to keep the financially
struggling competitive carrier in operation (TR, Oct. 2, 1995). 
The AT&T spokesman clarified that "we're not writing off Unitel. 
We plan to continue to use it as the base of operations for
telecom services in Canada."

The spokesman said AT&T also plans to "refocus" its United
Kingdom Istel data network operations to align it more closely
with strategic business plans of AT&T's Uniworld European
networking partnership.  Foreign sales offices for Network
Systems and Global Business Communications Services and foreign
manufacturing operations will be consolidated "where that makes
sense," a cable manufacturing plant in Ireland will be improved,
and another plant in Taiwan will be retooled, the spokesman said. 

Closing, selling, or consolidating facilities determined not to
be "strategic to the new companies' future operations," including
lease terminations, will cost about $1.1 billion, AT&T said. 
Other actions included in the reorganization plans will cost
almost $700 million.  The cost savings from the restructuring
measures will ensure the new AT&T companies' ability to "make the
necessary investments to be strong competitors," said Rick
Miller, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer.  AT&T intends to launch the new companies with sizes,
assets, and corporate structures appropriate to industry leaders,
he said.

AT&T said it will not identify specific actions involving job
cuts until affected employees are notified and said it cannot
disclose other steps included in the reorganization plan because
of disclosure restrictions imposed by the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission in relation to a planned initial public
offering (IPO) for the systems-technology company.  Mr. Miller
said AT&T has begun preparing the SEC registration statement for
the IPO, which is expected to go to market by the end of this
quarter.  AT&T also has requested an Internal Revenue Service
ruling that the breakup into three companies can be accomplished
as a tax-free transaction for shareholders, he said.

FCC REMAINS CLOSED; AUCTIONS TO BEGIN TOMORROW

Sources within the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau
confirmed today that the agency would continue three auctions of
radio licenses this week despite the ongoing government shutdown. 
The sale of multipoint distribution service licenses will begin
tomorrow (Wednesday), and the specialized mobile radio and "C"
block personal communications service auctions will start Jan. 4
and Jan. 5, respectively.  The Commission remained closed today,
although "essential" staff in the wireless bureau and several
attorneys in the Office of the General Counsel were working
today.  A notice offering furlough loans to FCC employees was
posted on agency walls as a grim reminder of the shutdown, which
now is in its third week.  The U.S. Premier Federal Credit Union
is offering loans at a discounted rate of 7% for six months. 
Qualified employees can obtain loans up to the amount of lost pay
but not exceeding $5,000.

WASHINGTON COMMISSION CLARIFIES 1995 COMPETITION RULES

The Washington Utilities & Transportation Commission has altered
and clarified "final" rules adopted last year (TR, Nov. 6, 1995)
establishing terms and conditions for local exchange competitors
to interconnect with U S WEST Communications, Inc., and
GTE-Northwest.  The action was in response to petitions by
several local exchange competitors.  The commission denied a GTE
petition to reconsider last year's order but granted requests by
AT&T Corp., MCI Communications Corp., Teleport Communications
Group, and several other companies to modify provisions
addressing interconnection, unbundling, and interim number
portability.  The commission's original order made no mention of
GTE, and competitors had sought clarification that GTE also was
subject to the number portability requirement.

The new order requires U S WEST and GTE to file unbundled loop
tariffs offering access to two-wire connections from end-users'
premises to the U S WEST and GTE central offices.  Petitioners
had sought a requirement that the incumbent LECs offer four-wire
connections that would enable them to offer digital
communications services.  The commission found that the two-wire
requirement was adequate to speed development of competition for
most local services.  It ordered U S WEST and GTE to file interim
number portability tariffs based on their incremental costs.  The
companies may assess nonrecurring charges, but those charges also
must be set at the companies' incremental costs, the commission
said.

The WUTC denied a request by AT&T and MCI that U S WEST and GTE
be required to offer all of their services for resale.  The
commission's original order only requires incumbents to offer
unbundled loop and other transport services.  The interexchange
carriers had claimed that the development of competition in the
state also depends on competitors' ability to resell bundled and
tariffed services.  The commission said that a general
elimination of resale restrictions would be better addressed in a
general rate case.  AT&T, which had asked the WUTC to reconsider
its earlier order, called the order "another step toward
achieving the goal of widespread local competition in
Washington."  U S WEST and GTE have 30 days to file the required
tariffs.  See Monday's TR for more details.

MARYLAND PSC SETS INTERCONNECTION, RESALE RATES

The Maryland Public Service Commission has set the rates and
conditions for interconnection and other aspects of local
exchange competition in the state.  The commission established
standard rates for terminating local traffic and the terms for
local competitors to resell Bell Atlantic-Maryland's local
service.  The PSC also adopted an interim number portability plan
and granted competitors the flexibility either to establish new
local calling areas or to use those of Bell Atlantic. 
Additionally, the commission required all carriers to provide
"911" service and launched a separate proceeding to examine
universal service issues.  The PSC in 1994 authorized MFS
Intelnet, Inc., to be the first provider of competitive local
service in the state (TR, May 2, 1994 and Aug. 8, 1994).  It
since has authorized MCImetro and TCG America, Inc., to enter the
local exchange services market.  TCG today endorsed the
commission order.  Later this month the PSC is scheduled to
consider an application by AT&T Corp. to provide both business
and residential local service (TR, Dec. 25, 1995).

REFORM LEGISLATION AWAITING BUDGET DEAL

Action on compromise telecommunications reform legislation
hammered out before the holiday break likely will be delayed
until a budget deal is struck, Washington sources said today. 
Only a few Senate conference committee members have signed off on
"final" language circulated just before Christmas (TR, Dec. 25,
1995).  Most conferees plan to stay in their districts until
budget negotiations between congressional leaders and the White
House are completed, so they cannot sign the conference report. 
"Until there is a deal on the budget, you're not going to find
the bulk of the members coming back," said an industry lobbyist. 
Despite initial opposition from key Republicans such as telecom
subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields (R., Texas), the source
predicted that a majority of conferees will approve the measure.

Lack of active opposition by industry--combined with the support
of Senate Democrats and the White House--has paved the way for
approval of the conference language, said another close observer
of the reform negotiations.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R.,
Ga.) is unlikely to oppose the reform bill because speculation
about his ties to Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch would
leave him open to conflict-of-interest charges, the source said.

CITIZENS ACQUIRES ALLTEL'S CALIFORNIA PHONE PROPERTIES

Citizens Utilities Co. of Stamford, Conn., today announced the
acquisition of almost 20,000 telephone access lines in California
from ALLTEL Corp. and the transfer of 3,600 Citizens access lines
in Pennsylvania to ALLTEL.  The acquisition is part of a
definitive agreement announced in November 1994 for Citizens to
purchase about 117,000 telephone and cable TV lines in eight
states (TR, Dec. 5, 1994).  The 1994 deal was valued at about
$292 million.  Previously, Citizens had purchased ALLTEL
telephone properties in West Virginia, Oregon, and Tennessee.  It
also had acquired ALLTEL CATV franchises in Arizona, California,
and New Mexico.  Purchase of ALLTEL's Nevada telephone property
is expected to be completed this year.  When the ALLTEL
transaction is completed, Citizens' operations will extend to 20
states.

Wireless Industry Pledges To Resolve Hearing Aid Compatibility
Problems

     Conceding that all digital wireless communications systems
potentially may cause electromagnetic interference, wireless
industry representatives have pledged to develop ways to make their
services accessible to the 6 million people in the U.S. who wear
hearing aids.  During a "summit" meeting on the issue held Jan. 3-4
in Washington, FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt said wireless equipment
manufacturers and service providers should have the flexibility to
determine what transmission technologies they will use in the
future.  But the Commission must ensure that people with
disabilities have access to telecom services, he added.

     Mr. Hundt said the FCC will not adopt what he called the
European model of mandating the use of specific digital wireless
technologies.  "We refuse to let any business talk us into
mandating their particular technology for the use of the airwaves,"
he said.  But market forces will not necessarily lead to the
resolution of all compatibility problems.  The FCC must be ready to
protect the interests of groups that traditionally have wielded
little power in the marketplace, Mr. Hundt said.

     Manufacturers, service providers, and consumer advocacy groups
should work together to identify compatibility problems, he
continued.  "This will be a continuous process because repeatedly
we will find incompatibilities between wireless devices and hearing
aids."  He said the Commission expects specific "action items" to
be generated by the two-day summit meeting, which was sponsored by
the Personal Communications Industry Association.

     The meeting stemmed from concerns raised last year by hearing
aid consumer advocacy groups.  One group requested that the FCC
initiate a rulemaking to review the potential for systems using the
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) digital wireless
standard to interfere with hearing aids (TRWN, June 15, 1995). 
Wireless industry representatives, however, told the Commission
that it would be premature to launch such a rulemaking proceeding
before conclusive test results were available (TRWN, July 27,
1995).

     During last week's meeting, industry representatives
emphasized that intensive research on equipment compatibility
already is under way.  Thomas E. Wheeler, President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, reported that the Center for the Study of
Electromagnetic Compatibility at Oklahoma University will release
the initial results of a study on Jan. 15.  CTIA also is conducting
a field evaluation of bystander interference problems using the
personal communications service (PCS) network recently activated in
the Washington, D.C., area by American Personal Communications. 
Results of that research are expected to be available Feb. 15.  Mr.
Wheeler said digital-service interference problems are no more
daunting than those the cellular industry faced when it introduced
analog wireless equipment more than 10 years ago.

     Meanwhile, CTIA has taken steps to ensure that wireless phones
meet European hearing aid standards.  As of July 1, 1997,
CTIA-certified handsets will not interfere with hearing aids that
are designed and tested to meet the requirements of the European
Commission's electromagnetic compatibility product standard for
hearing aids.  A CTIA development group also has devised a
technical standard for phones based on the code-division
multiple-access (CDMA) digital standard.  Hearing aid wearers can
turn off the "variable rate vocoder" component of CDMA phones,
which can be a source of interference for some types of hearing
aids.

Plug-in Devices Help Hearing Aid Wearers

     According to panelists at the meeting, several devices are
available that enable hearing-impaired people to use digital
telephones without interference.  The "HATIS" device, for example,
can plug into a wireless phone.  Coupled with a "tele-coil"
(t-coil) hearing aid, it can boost the decibel level on the hearing
aid enough to allow even profoundly deaf individuals to use the
mobile phone.  A similar piece of equipment, known as a "JABRA"
device, provides amplification to non-t-coil hearing aids.

     George Schmitt, President of Omnipoint Communications, Inc.,
said the availability of such devices does not mean the wireless
industry should stop developing other alternatives for people with
disabilities.  "Operators must serve all the market, or they will
pay in the end," Mr. Schmitt warned.  He observed that some 22
million Americans suffer from some sort of hearing loss "and there
isn't an operator in this world that is dumb enough to ignore 10%
of the population."

     Arnold Pohs, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
of CommNet Cellular, Inc., said, "The industry has accepted its
responsibility to ensure that the transition to digital [wireless
technologies] does not disenfranchise any American."  Mr. Pohs, who
wears a hearing aid himself, added, "Independent scientific
research will provide us with long-term solutions for resolving
electromagnetic compatibility issues."

     Other panelists included engineers from Motorola, Inc.,
Ericsson, Inc., and Omnipoint Technology, Inc., the research and
development arm of Omnipoint Corp.  Mike Williams, a Senior
Engineer at Omnipoint, noted that all radio frequency (RF)
transmitters are capable of causing interference.  Hearing aid
interference occurs mainly when RF signals are amplitude modulated,
he explained.  Such pulse signals are common with mobile phones
based on either GSM or CDMA technologies, he said, adding that all
PCS systems incorporate some sort of amplitude modulation.  "Higher
RF output increases the range of interference, but that is why the
FCC has set limits on output levels," Mr. Williams said.

     Ray Millington, Vice President and Director-engineering for
the Advanced Products and Technology Division of the Cellular
Subscriber Group at Motorola, said the industry is evolving from
the use of a single antenna site with high-power radios to the use
of several antennas with low-power radios.  That will lead
manufacturers to develop shielding mechanisms and other devices
that can minimize radio interference problems, he said.

S&P Revises Financial Guidelines For Wireless Telephone Companies

     Credit-rating company Standard & Poor's is revising the
financial guidelines it applies to ratings of wireless
communications companies.  The business risks associated with
cellular telephone companies, in particular, have improved to the
extent that many firms can sustain less stringent financial ratios
for the same credit ratings as companies in other industries, S&P
concluded last week.  The new guidelines apply to cellular and
personal communications service (PCS) companies, although PCS
operators are expected to face many of the same start-up risks as
the early cellular companies.

     That will mean that PCS providers "will have somewhat
worse-than-average business risk profiles," and "more stringent
financial ratios will apply" to them, S&P said.  It cited dramatic
growth in cellular subscribership as the reason that business-risk
profiles of cellular companies have improved.

     The ratings firm said its new guidelines also will be used to
assess the credit profiles of large, diversified telecom companies
that own the majority of U.S. wireless assets.  These include AT&T
Corp., Sprint Corp., the Bell regional holding companies, and major
independent telecom companies such as GTE Corp.  "Although the
wireless segment does not represent a majority of these companies'
assets, it is their fastest growing segment," S&P observed.  "Under
the revised benchmarks, companies with significant cellular
holdings are now viewed as being somewhat less risky, while those
with a major commitment to PCS are viewed as still having
significant credit risk for the PCS portion of their wireless
business." 

     S&P will use the following measurements to determine the
credit ratings of wireless communications companies:

     *    Pretax interest coverage.  This is a measurement of
income before interest and taxes--divided by interest costs--that
indicates "earnings protection."

     *    EBITDA interest coverage.  S&P uses a measurement of
cellular cash flow--minus marketing costs and EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)--relative
to total interest cost.  This measures a company's minimum ability
to meet interest costs using available cash.

     *    The ratio of total debt to EBITDA.  Total debt relative
to cash flow after marketing costs (EBITDA) is used to determine a
company's debt "exposure."

     *    Debt per "pop."  This measures the ratio of total debt to
total "pops" (potential customers).  Wireless properties continue
to be sold or traded, leading S&P to believe that it can estimate

Alcatel Wins Multimillion-Dollar PCS Contract from Sprint Venture

     Alcatel Network Systems has signed a "multimillion-dollar"
agreement with the Sprint Telecommunications Venture (STV) to
supply equipment and relocation services to incumbent licensees
operating microwave systems in the 2 gigahertz spectrum band.  An
Alcatel spokesman declined to give a specific dollar figure, but he
said the deal could be worth millions of dollars, considering that
Sprint wants to offer personal communications services (PCS) in up
to 25 markets this year.  Before offering those services, Sprint
must pay to upgrade or replace the facilities of incumbent
licensees that must clear the 2 GHz band.

     Alcatel is cooperating with STV on several spectrum-relocation
projects in the Midwest, the spokesman said.  Last year STV won PCS
licenses covering the Milwaukee, Detroit, and Indianapolis "Major
Trading Areas" (TRWN, March 23, 1995).  

     Alcatel plans to supply incumbents with new radio equipment
designed to operate in the 6 GHz band and to supply PCS back-haul
equipment interconnecting cell sites.

     Meanwhile, Alcatel said last week that Pacific Bell Mobile
Services, another PCS licensee, has purchased new radio equipment
for the relocation of public safety wireless facilities operated by
the County of Santa Barbara, Calif.  

     The Alcatel spokesman estimated that Pacific Bell will spend
about $1 million to relocate five microwave links for the county. 
That estimate is in line with other industry estimates, which put
the cost of relocating a single link at about $200,000 to $250,000.

     Alcatel--which has submitted bids to all PCS licensees
planning to upgrade or relocate 2 GHz facilities--expects to
announce similar relocation deals with Western Wireless Corp. and
BellSouth Personal Communications, Inc., the spokesman said.  He
said there is a $1 billion market for spectrum relocation services.

Arch To Acquire Westlink In $210 Million Paging Deal

     Arch Communications Group, Inc., has signed a definitive
agreement to acquire Westlink Holdings, Inc., for $210 million in
cash and the assumption of $130 million in Westlink debt.  The deal
will make Arch the third-largest paging carrier in the U.S., with
more than 2.5 million subscribers.  Arch will finance the
acquisition through an existing credit line and additional loans. 

     A privately held company, Westlink was formed in 1994 to
acquire the paging assets of U S WEST Paging, Inc. (TRWN, Oct. 21,
1993; and July 14, 1994).  Westlink operates paging systems in a
14-state region west of the Mississippi, while most of Arch's
paging assets are concentrated east of the Mississippi.  According
to C.E. Baker Jr., Arch's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the
acquisition "will effectively complete the geographic footprint
that makes us a national player."

     Arch also will gain access to other paging licenses through
Westlink's 49.9% stake in Benbow PCS Ventures, Inc., the winner of
two regional narrowband personal communications service (PCS)
licenses sold at an FCC auction last year (TRWN, Nov. 17, 1994). 
Arch currently owns about 11% of PCS Development Corp., a
Greenville, S.C., company that won five regional narrowband PCS
licenses at the same auction.  Arch plans to resell that company's
two-way paging services when commercial operations are launched in
1997.

     Separately, AirTouch Communications, Inc., announced the
completion of its acquisition of privately held Message Center
Beepers.  Hartford, Conn.-based Message Center will contribute more
than 345,000 customers to AirTouch Paging's installed customer
base.  Message Center executives also announced the formation of a
new company to provide Internet access, cellular, and long distance
services in major eastern U.S. markets.  The new company, dubbed
ZipCall L.L.C., will be based in Hartford.  Its network will
feature ISDN (integrated services digital network) and frame relay
capabilities.  Customers will have toll-free access to the Internet
and will be able to take advantage of a variety of high-speed,
dial-up access plans.

APC, Md. Agency Face PCS Network Interference Problems

     American Personal Communications has rejected claims that its
personal communications service (PCS) system is interfering with
the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In a recent
letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration (MTA) stated
that the new wireless service has caused "serious interference" to
the communications operations of light rail and bus services
operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations.  

     The letter was made public by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing
incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz
spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it had
distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.

     Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, expressed
concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to "politicize" the
effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to other spectrum bands. 


     The relocation of incumbent operators has been a contentious
issue since the FCC first drafted rules requiring 2 GHz licensees
to clear that band to make way for new PCS licensees (TRWN, Sept.
24, 1992; and July 29, 1993).  The Commission recently clarified
rules adopted in the Engineering and Technology docket 92-9
"emerging technologies" proceeding, further defining "good faith"
negotiations over relocation issues between licensees (TRWN, Oct.
16, 1995).

     The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions last
fall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transit
communications system.  "These communications interruptions have
posed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated. 
The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs incurred as
a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Brown
declined to comment further on the interference problems, noting
that it involves "a possible issue of litigation."

     Ms. Schelle told TRWN that interference problems with the mass
transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to the MTA,
an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have reported no
public-safety problems resulting from interference between the two
radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a responsibility to
respond to frequency coordination notices in a timely manner, the
attorney added.  

     The MTA received at least six such letters indicating that APC
planned to test its PCS system, he said, but MTA officials failed
to respond to a single one.  "Microwave licensees that ignore
frequency coordination notices do so at their own peril," the APC
attorney stated.  "PCS licensees can only protect licensed
facilities if they are informed of the complete parameters of those
facilities' operations.  APC fully protected the facilities
represented on MTA's FCC license and could not have known, without
being informed by MTA, that MTA is operating at a variance from
those parameters."

Canadian Government Awards Four Nationwide PCS Licenses

     As the third U.S. auction of personal communications service
(PCS) licenses got under way, Industry Canada announced that it had
awarded four nationwide PCS licenses.  Clearnet Communications,
Inc., of Pickering, Ontario, and MicroCell Network, Inc., of
Montreal, each were awarded 30 megahertz PCS licenses.  Rogers
Cantel Mobile, Inc., and Mobility Personacom Canada Ltd., were
awarded separate 10 MHz licenses.  Industry Minister John Manley
said the four new licensees will invest more than $3 billion to
develop their PCS systems.  He estimated that 8,500 new jobs will
be created over the next five years as the PCS market develops.

     "The decision to award the two new, large 30 MHz licenses to
noncellular companies will create a sound industry structure, which
should facilitate the development of enhanced competition and
innovation," said Clearnet Chairman and Vice President Robert C.
Simmonds.  Clearnet currently operates enhanced specialized mobile
radio networks for businesses in major metro areas.  Nextel
Communications, Inc., and Motorola, Inc., are minority shareholders
in Clearnet, which now plans to serve the consumer market with its
PCS offerings.  According to Clearnet's market research, one in two
Canadians is interested in using new personal communications
services.

     MicroCell Network, which won the other 30 MHz license, is a
start-up company whose major shareholder is Charles Sirois,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Teleglobe, Inc.  A group of
Canadian cable TV companies is among the other major investors in
MicroCell.  Rogers Cantel, one of two incumbent cellular service
providers in Canada, will use its 10 MHz license to expand its
current service offerings.  

     Based in Etobicoke, Ontario, Mobility Personacom is an
affiliate of Mobility Canada, the other Canadian cellular carrier. 
Mobility Canada is a national corporation whose "member companies"
are the 11 cellular affiliates of the provincial landline telephone
companies.  The four Canadian PCS licensees will operate their
systems on the same frequencies as their counterparts in the U.S.--
between 1.8 gigahertz and 1.9 GHz.

SBC Affiliate Wins Authority To Offer LEC Service in Chicago

     The Illinois Commerce Commission has authorized an SBC
Communications, Inc., affiliate to offer landline local exchange
service in the greater Chicago area, enabling it to compete
directly with Ameritech-Illinois.  SBMS Illinois Services, Inc., an
affiliate of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc. (SBMS),
submitted an application last year seeking permission to provide
local exchange services.  The commission's decision will allow it
to offer wireline services under the Cellular One brand name--the
same name SBMS uses to market cellular service in Chicago.

     An SBC spokesman said SBMS Illinois will file intrastate
tariffs during the first part of 1996.  The company plans to offer
service in an area including Cook, DuPage, and Kane Counties, and
portions of McHenry, Kendall, and Will Counties.  Last October, SBC
was authorized by the New York Public Service Commission to offer
local exchange service in upstate New York.

     SBMS currently offers cellular service to customers in the
Rochester and Buffalo metropolitan statistical areas, also under
the Cellular One brand name.

     The spokesman told TRWN that SBC aggressively is exploring
local exchange markets outside its traditional five-state
territory.  The company is particularly interested in bundling
cellular and wireline services in markets where it already operates
cellular systems, including Boston, Baltimore, and Washington,
D.C., he said.  The fact that Massachusetts and Maryland already
permit competition for the provision of facilities-based, switched
local exchange services may prove helpful to SBC.  In Washington,
city government regulators are considering proposed competition
rules.

     The spokesman confirmed that SBC intends to offer wireline
services and not fixed wireless local loop services in Chicago and
upstate New York.  But he declined to identify how the company will
put together its local exchange network.  SBC is considering a
number of possible options, including reselling local exchange
services, he said.

     Last October the FCC granted SBMS a rule waiver allowing it to
bundle cellular and wireline local exchange services and to offer
them to out-of-region customers (TRWN, Nov. 2, 1995).  Commission
rules preclude cellular affiliates of Bell operating companies from
owning landline local exchange facilities.  Pursuant to the waiver,
SBMS has proposed to offer what it calls "competitive landline
local exchange services" through a corporate entity that shares
facilities, systems, and personnel with SBMS' cellular operations. 
That business would be managed by the same executives who manage
SBMS.

'Bill-and-Keep' Method of Interconnection Proposed for LECs, CMRS
Providers

     In an effort to encourage the development of new wireless
services, the FCC recently proposed implementing a new
interconnection regime allowing local exchange carriers (LECs) and
commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers to terminate one
another's calls without charging the originating carrier for call
completion.  

     This interconnection method, generally known as "bill and
keep," currently is used among LECs.  During its most recent public
meeting, the Commission voted to adopt a rulemaking notice to
establish a similar policy, on an interim basis, for LEC-CMRS
interconnection.  Under the proposal, carriers would be permitted
to keep the revenues from calls originated on their own networks. 
This new interconnection model had been proposed by the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association (TRWN, Dec. 14, 1995).

     "Interconnection is an essential component of all networks,"
observed Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina M. Keeney.  Although
the FCC already has general interconnection rules, they do not take
into account the proliferation of new wireless service providers
that will be handling an increasing volume of voice traffic, she
added.

     The rulemaking proposal, which launched docket 95-185,
"tentatively concludes that the interim plan [should include] a
bill-and-keep approach for most network components, for both peak
and off-peak hours," said Kathleen L. Franco, a Common Carrier
Bureau staff attorney who presented the NPRM for Commission
consideration.  

     "Bill and keep is administratively simple, will prevent LECs
from charging excessive interconnection rates, and will likely
approximate the incremental costs of terminating traffic, at least
during off-peak periods," she explained.

     The NPRM seeks comment on how long the interim plan should
remain in effect.  It also seeks comment on how interconnection
arrangements should be made public--either through tariffs or
through some other public disclosure requirement.  The Commission
tentatively concluded that rates for dedicated transmission
facilities connecting LEC and CMRS networks should be based on
existing access charges (usually flat-rated fees) for similar
network facilities.

     The proposal invited comments on whether the FCC should adopt
the following:

(1) A federal interconnection model that would directly govern
interstate LEC-CMRS interconnection but that would not be binding
on state regulatory commissions for intrastate services; 

(2) A general mandatory interconnection model with broad
parameters, giving state commissions a range of choices regarding
LEC-CMRS interconnection obligations; or 

(3) A model with specific requirements for interstate and
intrastate interconnection between LECs and CMRS providers.  

     The Commission tentatively concluded that it has the legal
authority to implement any of those alternative approaches, based
on section 332 of the Communications Act.  According to David
Sieradzki, a Common Carrier Bureau staff attorney, the first option
would give state regulators the most flexibility.  Under that
option, the FCC would be responsible for regulating interstate
interconnection requirements, but intrastate interconnection
obligations would be determined by state regulatory commissions. 
The third option, which calls for the FCC to adopt specific
interconnection rules, would offer states the least flexibility,
Mr. Sieradzki said.  "The FCC is very intent on working
cooperatively with the states on interconnection issues," he added.

Commissioners Promise To Cooperate with States

     Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett said state and federal
jurisdictional issues should be reviewed carefully during the
proceeding.  "While the Commission makes several tentative
conclusions in the [NPRM] concerning its legal authority, I
emphasize that these findings are tentative. . .and that we will
consider all relevant arguments and theories."  He noted that 33
states so far have removed barriers to local exchange competition. 
"Washington, Texas, Pennsylvania, and California, to name a few,
have been at the forefront on these issues and have implemented
bill and keep as an interim arrangement," he said in a separate
statement.  "I will do my part as a member of this Commission to
ensure that our continuing efforts will be fully coordinated with
the state regulators."

     Chairman Reed E. Hundt said, "We have good relations with the
states, and we want to continue to work with them on this issue." 
The interim interconnection plan "proposes an intensely practical
solution," Mr. Hundt said.  He advised commenters to "think very
hard about the economics of this policy and about the market power
of LECs versus the market power of CMRS providers."  He added that
the FCC must consider adopting regulations that "will not burden
wireless carriers." 

     In a separate statement, Commissioner Susan Ness said, "We
must not abridge the LECs' legal or equitable rights, distort
marketplace incentives for CMRS providers, or cause prices for
other LEC customers to increase."  

     The Commission "must seek to maintain the federal-state
cooperation that we have worked so hard to develop," she added. 
Commissioner Rachelle B. Chong said she would prefer that the FCC
not require carriers to file tariffs with voluminous cost-support
data.

FCC Adopts Competitive Bidding Rules for 800 MHz SMR Licenses

     The FCC has adopted an order outlining a wide-area licensing
scheme for the 800 megahertz specialized mobile radio (SMR)
service.  In a separate order, it set competitive bidding rules for
800 MHz SMR licenses.  And in Private Radio docket 93-144, it
adopted a rulemaking proposal to relocate incumbent 800 MHz SMR
licensees in order to accommodate wide-area systems.  The FCC
sought comment on a proposed "two-phase" mandatory relocation
scheme that would make new 800 MHz SMR operators responsible for
providing incumbent licensees with comparable network facilities.

     During its Dec. 15 public meeting, the FCC adopted its "first
report and order" in docket 93-144, dividing the upper 200 channels
in the 800 MHz band into three spectrum blocks for wide-area
licensing.  The 200 channels will be divided into separate blocks
of 120, 60, and 20 channels, designated according to "economic
areas" (EAs) defined by the Commerce Department.  These licenses
will be sold at auction.  The Commission adopted a 10-year license
term and a five-year construction period for EA licensees.  These
licensees must offer coverage to one-third of the population in
their service area after three years.  Half the population must be
covered after the five-year construction benchmark.

     The order also reallocated the General Category channels--
which include 150 contiguous 25 kilohertz channels--in the 800 MHz
band to the SMR service.  It partially lifts the "freeze" on new
SMR and General Category channels, so potential EA license
applicants can relocate incumbents out of the upper 200 channels in
the 800 MHz band.

     In the "eighth report and order" in Plans and Policy docket
93-253, the FCC implemented rules to award 525 EA licenses in a
single, simultaneous-multiple-round auction.  Incumbents and new
entrants are eligible to bid for EA licenses.  The order permits
qualified small businesses to use bidding credits, and it allows
rural telephone companies to acquire parts of other EA licenses. 
This process is referred to as "partitioning."

     Finally, the FCC's "second further notice of proposed
rulemaking" in docket 93-144 tentatively concluded that EA
licensees should be allowed to "disaggregate" their spectrum
blocks.  The FCC defined disaggregation as "assigning discrete
portions of the spectrum licensed to a geographic licensee." 
Accordingly, the entity that is assigned a portion of the spectrum
would receive a separate EA license to operate on the disaggregated
channels throughout the license area.  The FCC also proposed
extending the partitioning rules to SMR licensees generally, rather
than limiting it to rural telephone companies.

     Regarding relocation, the Commission suggested that an EA
licensee's offer to replace an incumbent's system with comparable
facilities constitutes a "good faith" offer.  Similarly, an
incumbent that accepts such an offer "presumably would be acting in
good faith," the agency said.  It proposed that "comparable
facilities" be defined as having the same number of channels with
the same bandwidth.

     The rulemaking proposal tentatively concludes that 800 MHz SMR
channels should be licensed on a geographic basis defined by EAs. 
The Commission proposed licensing the lower 80 channels in the 800
MHz band in five-channel blocks.  It also proposed licensing the
General Category channel blocks in the same manner.  It proposed to
offer bidding credits and to auction an "entrepreneur's block" of
licenses that would be limited to qualified small businesses.

     Commissioner James H. Quello remarked that the 800 MHz
licensing rules "have been so highly contentious that [the orders
are] unlikely to satisfy everyone."  Chairman Reed E. Hundt said
many people had voiced concerns about the 800 MHz service rules. 
The orders adopted last week offer "the best possible degree of
consensus," he said.

     Nextel Communications, Inc., the largest SMR operator in the
country, praised the new 800 MHz licensing rules.  It said the
rules give Nextel and other SMR licensees "the opportunity to
assemble individual licenses into large blocks of contiguous
spectrum," similar to what cellular and personal communications
service providers are able to do.

FCC Proposes Auctioning 37 GHz, 39 GHz Licenses, Revises Technical
Rules

     To make more spectrum available for point-to-point microwave
radio operations, the FCC has adopted a rulemaking notice that
would amend the licensing and technical rules for systems operating
in the 37.0-38.6 gigahertz band, also known as the 37 GHz band.  It
also has proposed to revise licensing and technical rules for
systems operating in the 38.6-40.0 GHz band, also referred to as
the 39 GHz band.  The agency proposed to auction the 3 GHz of
spectrum divided between the two bands and to offer bidding credits
and other incentives to qualified auction participants.  The
Commission also voted to process pending 39 GHz license
applications, with Chairman Reed E. Hundt and Commissioner Susan
Ness dissenting.

     The Commission's proposal to amend parts 1, 2, 21, and 94 of
its rules stems from a rulemaking petition (RM-8553) filed by the
Telecommunications Industry Association.  At last month's public
meeting, the FCC proposed auctioning spectrum licenses based on
"Basic Trading Areas."  To accommodate incumbent operators, it
proposed to give existing 39 GHz licensees 18 months from the
adoption of an order in the proceeding to certify that they have
constructed "a minimum average of four permanently installed and
operating links per hundred square kilometers" of their licensed
service areas.  This equates to about one link per 10 square miles.

     Incumbents with more than one channel block of spectrum would
be required to certify that each channel block contains at least
four permanently installed and operating links.  If a licensee met
these threshold requirements, it would be eligible to retain rights
to serve its entire service area.  If an incumbent did not meet
these requirements, it automatically would lose its license 19
months after adoption of an order, the Commission said.  

     The FCC proposed adopting such measures in order to prevent
speculators from "warehousing" spectrum.  The 37 GHz and 39 GHz
spectrum bands have been identified as potentially valuable
property by those who intend to provide infrastructure for
commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers.  Some companies
plan to use the spectrum to offer backhaul facilities for new
personal communications service licensees, the FCC observed.

     Regarding the hundreds of pending 39 GHz applications, the
Commission ordered the following action:  Pending applications will
be processed if they were not mutually exclusive with other
applications at the time the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau
stopped accepting new applications.  The FCC also proposed to apply
the same rules to these applicants as it proposed for incumbent 39
GHz operators.  

     Other pending applications will not be processed at this time,
although the FCC will determine whether to process or return them
at the conclusion of this proceeding.  An exception to this policy
would be extended to 39 GHz incumbents that filed applications to
modify their systems without enlarging their service areas.

Hundt, Ness Dissent from Majority

     Commissioner James H. Quello reiterated his long-standing
position that pending applications should be processed according to
the rules that were in effect when they first were filed. 
Commissioner Rachelle B. Chong emphasized that
non-mutually-exclusive license applications do not fall within the
FCC's auction authority.  

     "Indeed, even if we had auction rules in place today, these
[39 GHz] applications would not be subject to auction.  Under
section 309 (j) of the Communications Act, the Commission has
authority to use competitive bidding only where mutually exclusive
applications are filed," she said in a separate statement. 
Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett made similar comments in his
separate statement.

     Commissioner Susan Ness said the majority's decision to
process the pending 39 GHz applications will result in a "Swiss
cheese effect," leaving holes in the spectrum that later will be
auctioned.  Chairman Reed E. Hundt also dissented from the
majority.  "There is no longer any serious dispute that sound
public policy requires assigning spectrum licenses by competitive
bidding except where there are clear and compelling public interest
reasons to the contrary," he said, adding that "no compelling
reasons have been given here."

FCC Allocates Spectrum for 'Millimeter-Wave' Applications

     The FCC has allocated 6.2 gigahertz of spectrum in the bands
above 40 GHz, establishing technical rules for the development and
introduction of "millimeter-wave services," (MWS) such as
automobile radar collision-avoidance systems.  Acting at its Dec.
15 meeting, the Commission adopted an order in the Engineering and
Technology docket 94-124 proceeding, approving the allocation of
three separate bands available for unlicensed use (TRWN, Nov. 3,
1994).

     The Commission allocated the 46.7-46.9 GHz and 76-77 GHz bands
for "smart car" systems.  In addition to collision warning and
avoidance, applications for such systems could include "automatic
cruise control" and "lane guidance," the Commission said.  To
protect vehicle safety systems from interference, use of the bands
will be restricted to such "smart car" operations at this time. 
The Commission also adopted a rulemaking proposal to suspend the
use of the 76-77 GHz band by amateur radio operators until sharing
technologies are developed.

     For "generic unlicensed use," the FCC designated the 59-64 GHz
band.  Such generic uses could include broadband computer
networking at data speeds of up to 5 gigabits per second. 
Transmission speeds over the MWS bands could approach those of
fiber optic systems, but only over short distances.  The Commission
will delay its allocation of the 59-64 GHz band for one year,
however, enabling industry groups to propose standards for spectrum
etiquette.  Wireless industry groups had sought such a delay before
unlicensed operations were permitted in the band.

     In its NPRM, the FCC sought comment on what those etiquette
standards should be.  It also proposed establishing limits on
emissions in the 200-231 GHz band and said that several additional
rulemakings could be initiated in the future to address operations
in the millimeter-wave bands.

     The new rules are "some of the most flexible ever offered by
the Commission," said Michael J. Marcus, Associate Chief of the
Office of Engineering and Technology.  Chairman Reed E. Hundt
agreed, calling them "a corollary" to the Commission's spectrum
auction policy.  The FCC should make available to industry spectrum
for which there are no competing demands, Mr. Hundt said.  The
proposal to allow the industry to suggest its own code of spectrum
etiquette demonstrates the FCC's willingness to be flexible when it
is appropriate, he said.

'Bill-and-Keep' Proposal Could Create More Local Exchange
Competition

By Roger Newell, Senior Contributing Editor

     In its last meeting of 1995 the FCC took steps to establish an
important component needed for competition in the local exchange
market.  The Commission adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking
that would implement a "bill-and-keep" method of interconnection
for local exchange carriers (LECs) and commercial mobile radio
service (CMRS) providers. Currently, when a call originated by a
cellular carrier is terminated by a LEC, the cellular carrier must
pay an access charge to the LEC.  When the call travels in the
opposite direction, however, the LEC does not pay anything to the
cellular carrier to complete the call.

     This imbalance has resulted from the monopoly position of the
LECs, which allows them to dictate the terms for interconnection. 
Access charges typically range from 2.5 to 3.5 cents per minute. 
According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association,
cellular carriers paid more than $800 million in access charges in
1994.  

     Without changing the current method of compensation for
CMRS-LEC call completion, this amount would rise significantly as
competition in the local exchange market is spurred by the advent
of personal communications services (PCS). The FCC's proposal to
institute a bill-and-keep system, under which each carrier would be
required to terminate traffic received from the other without
payment, would remedy this problem on an interim basis.  

     Accordingly, each carrier would keep the entire revenue from
calls that it bills.  This is an important step forward.  Fair and
reasonable rates and terms of interconnection are essential for the
development of local exchange competition.  As Commissioner
Rachelle B. Chong has noted, "Timely and reasonably priced
interconnection is the lifeblood of competition among alternative
service providers."

     Although a charge of about 3 cents per minute may not seem to
be much, it could have a chilling effect on competition.  A one-way
payment by one competitor to another tilts the playing field and
prevents equal competition.  

     The effect is not small; even 3 cents is a significant
percentage of cellular rates, which typically are around 35 cents
in many markets.  If, as the FCC hopes, the launch of PCS this year
results in lower rates for telephone service, the access charges
would loom as an ever-larger percentage of LEC revenue.

     Replacement of the one-way payment method with a bill-and-keep
mechanism represents a sea change in the position of wireless
carriers.  From the inception of the service in the early 1980s,
cellular carriers have had the legal right to interconnect with
LECs as co-carriers.  This also entitles them to mutual
compensation for interchanged traffic.  The necessary agreements
were never executed, however, resulting in the present one-way
payment arrangement.  (Some LECs have argued that the access
charges were reduced to compensate for the lack of mutual
compensation).  The present situation favors the LECs, leaving them
with little incentive to negotiate mutual compensation agreements.

'Bill and Keep' Presents Milestone for CMRS Providers

     With bill and keep, however, the situation is reversed.  The
overwhelming flow of traffic is from the wireless carrier to the
landline carrier.  This is largely because cellular service
requires subscribers to pay relatively high charges for airtime for
incoming and outgoing calls.  As a result, many cellular
subscribers reserve their handsets for outgoing calls.  Thus, bill
and keep could cause the landline carriers to lose considerable
revenue.  The incentive to negotiate a fair mutual compensation
arrangement now shifts to the landline carrier, and the way is
cleared for new carriers to compete on economically viable terms.

     The bill-and-keep proposal is intended to effect a sort of
rough justice until more sophisticated and accurate methods of
compensation for call termination are developed.  It would provide
equity between LECs and their competitors only if the amount of
traffic in each direction is approximately equal.  The flow of
traffic, however, is likely to remain uneven at least during the
next few years.  But bill and keep is more equitable than the
current one-way system.

     Of course the most logical long-term solution would be for
each carrier to charge other carriers the actual cost of
terminating calls.  The FCC said it believes that prices based on
"long-run incremental costs" best reflect the true economic cost of
a service.  However, using internal costs as the basis of access
charging presents difficult practical and administrative issues,
not the least of which would be endless disputes between the
parties on how to measure these costs.

     One possible variation on the bill-and-keep proposal was
suggested by Frontier Corp. (formerly Rochester Telephone Corp.). 
To encourage new competitors to enter the market, it proposed that
the bill-and-keep method apply unless and until the traffic
imbalance exceeded 10%, in which case appropriate payments would be
made to even the score.  Assuming that the proposals in the NPRM
are finally adopted in their present form, CMRS providers would
find their task greatly eased.  

     The access revenue has allowed LECs to keep their rates for
residential and business customers artificially low.  With that
income drying up, presumably the LECs' rates for local service
would have to rise to compensate.  That, in turn, would make the
CMRS carriers' competitive situation more favorable.

     This proceeding is only part of the measures necessary to have
full local exchange competition.  Still to come are the efforts to
work out problems concerning number portability and universal
service.  Nevertheless, it is clear that competition in the local
exchange market will flourish in the next few years, as a result of
pressure on the LECs from both the federal government and state
authorities.  To date, 33 states have removed legal barriers to
local exchange competition, and many of them have implemented bill
and keep as an interim plan.

     In some cases, LECs have proposed more equitable arrangements
than the current one.  For example, NYNEX Corp. and MFS
Communications Co., Inc., a competitive access provider, agreed to
a plan that provides for half-call billing.  Each carrier pays the
other 1.6 cents per minute to terminate most calls.  This is about
half the rate paid by the public.  With bill and keep, costs could
be even lower.

COURT SHOULD CONSIDER MTEL LICENSE SEPARATELY, FCC SAYS

     The FCC has told the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington that
it should not consider the Commission's licensing scheme for
private paging licensees in its deliberations on whether Mobile
Telecommunication Technologies Corp. (Mtel) should pay for a
license obtained through the agency's "pioneer's preference"
program.  Last month the court heard oral arguments in case no.
94-1552, Mtel v. FCC, in which Mtel challenged the Commission's
authority to charge a $33 million fee for the company's narrowband
personal communications service (PCS) license without first
receiving congressional authority (TRWN, Dec. 14, 1995).

     During the hearing, Mtel attorneys argued that the company
should not have to pay for its two-way paging license because the
FCC has granted free licenses to other paging companies that will
compete with Mtel.  The court had requested supporting
documentation, which Mtel supplied.  In its response to Mtel's
"post-argument submission," the FCC argued that private paging
licenses are not comparable to Mtel's license.  "Mtel is a licensee
in a brand new service (narrowband PCS) in a newly allocated
frequency band," the agency explained, adding that all other
licensees planning to offer narrowband PCS have paid substantial
sums for their licenses at a government auction.

     The FCC noted that it was Mtel's choice to develop an advanced
two-way paging system.  "To the best of our knowledge, Mtel did not
apply for a private paging license at 929-930 [megahertz]," it
said.  Furthermore, "Mtel's choice to commit substantial amounts of
money to its narrowband PCS licenses when private paging licenses
were 'free' undercuts its assertion in this court that the
Commission is applying different rules to identical licenses," the
agency added.

SMR RESALE

     Pittencrieff Communications, Inc., a specialized mobile radio

incumbent licensees.

     In its petition for reconsideration of a recent order in the
Private Radio docket 89-553 proceeding (TRWN, Sept. 21, 1995),
Pittencrieff argued that SMR operators obtaining licenses at
auction will not be able to meet coverage requirements unless they
can enter into such resale agreements.

GLOBAL SATELLITE EXECUTIVES MEET IN PARIS
by Cynthia Boeke

      This September, the world satellite industry's glitterati met in
Paris at the fifth Satel Conseil Symposium to discuss issues facing
the future development of the satellite industry. 
     Among the most talked-about developments were the high rate of
growth in the satellite industry; the development of Ka-band systems
for Internet-related broadband, multimedia applications; growth in the
use of geostationary satellites for mobile telephony services; and the
challenge of orbital slot overcrowding.
     Satel Conseil is a French consortium that provides international
consulting, engineering and technical assistance services in the field
of space communications.

THE FRENCH CONTRIBUTION

      "Growth in the satellite market has exceeded everyone's
expectations," said Francois Fillon, French Cabinet Minister for
Postal Services, Telecommunications and Space. "Everything points to
future growth as well." 
     Fillon noted that low earth orbit (LEO) constellations are
playing a major role in this growth, but that growth in the number of
new geostationary satellites is just as rapid. 
     Three of the world's leading geostationary satellite bus and
payload manufacturers--Matra Marconi Space, Aerospatiale and
Alcatel--are French. "It is vital for France and Europe to preserve
and increase our industrial capability by making sure [French
satellite manufacturers]
have the technology they need," said Fillon. He highlighted the
Stentor program, a partnership between French government and industry,
which will "develop tomorrow's satellite technology--extra capacity
and lifetime."
     Although France is playing a major role in geostationary
satellite manufacturing, Fillon said that "American manufacturers have
taken the initiative in LEO constellations. We must pay tribute to the
American ability to mobilize resources, but we must respond with
second-generation constellations for high data rate exchanges."

THE INTERNET CONNECTION

      Much of the discussion at Satel Conseil centered on the growing
role of the Internet and the potential use of satellites to become a
major Internet delivery vehicle. 
     "Before 2005, the Internet will have exploded," said Serge
Tchuruk, chairman and CEO of Alcatel Alsthom. "It will disintegrate
and be reconfigured." The reason, according to Tchuruk: the Internet
is not business-oriented and is susceptible to technical disruptions.
     "When the Internet is rebuilt," he said, "it will incorporate
broadband multimedia." By that time, he predicted," satellites will be
orbital networks complementing terrestrial networks.
They will be one of the key telecommunications technologies in the
21st century."
     Indeed, one of the systems serving the interactive, broadband
multimedia needs of future users could be Sativod, a constellation of
64 medium earth orbit satellites proposed by Alcatel.
      Sativod is being designed to provide access to the Internet and
online services, remote access to enterprises, telecommuting,
videoconferencing, teleteaching, telemedicine and entertainment
services, said Pascale Sourisse, director of planning and strategy at
Alcatel Espace.
     Sourisse said that there will be 15 million to 20 million
potential Sativod users around the world by the end of the next
decade.
     Future satellite-delivered multimedia services will be driven by
"prosumers," said Karl Savatiel, president of AstroLink at Lockheed
Martin Telecommunications. Prosumers will use the broadband,
interactive satellite services for teleworking and personal use in
their homes or remote offices, he said.
     "Internet backbones are not adequate," said Ronald Maehl, senior
vice president of strategy at Space Systems/Loral. Such a situation,
he said, will provide myriad opportunities for new Ka-band,
satellite-based Internet services, including SS/L's proposed Cyberstar
system.

MOBILE TELEPHONY

      The growing role of geostationary satellites for mobile
telephony applications was underscored at Satel Conseil. 
     According to Michael Williams, vice president of mobile
communications systems at Lockheed Martin Telecommunications,
developing countries are "driving a dramatic increase in demand for
cost-competitive voice services." Lockheed Martin, he continued, can
provide a geostationary satellite-based solution for direct-to-user
mobile telephony with its LMA2100AX high power/dissipation satellite
bus. Its attributes include commercially viable 12- to 15-meter
reflectors; commercially available digital transmission and coding
techniques; and low mass, low power onboard signal processing.
     Meanwhile Inmarsat, for its part, is studying a possible
successor to the new Inmarsat 3 generation of geostationary
satellites, said Warren Grace, director general of Inmarsat. The
potential Inmarsat 4 satellites, he said, might be used to serve new
business markets and provide broadband, broadcast, navigation and
rural communications services. "The chosen solution will probably be
GEO-based," he said, because it allows "less complex user terminals,
reduced network complexity, lower probability of outages and
continuity with existing services." 
     Vladimir Tamarkin, first deputy director of Informcosmos and
director of Russia's Marafon project, provided details of the Marafon
mobile satellite system. Marafon, he said, will comprise five
geostationary Arkos satellites and three or four highly elliptical
orbit Mayak satellites. Initially, services will be provided using a
European satellite. The majority of the system is scheduled to be
operational by 1999.
     The main strategies for Marafon, Tamarkin said, are to attract
advanced foreign technologies to develop the means of space and ground
segments of the system, develop strategic partnerships with foreign
companies, develop partnerships with existing European mobile
satellite service providers, and attract investment for Marafon's
space segment.
     Another geostationary-based system that is looking for partners
is the Euro-African Satellite Telecommunications (EAST) project
proposed by Matra Marconi Space. According to Jean Maury,
director/sales manager for the Civil Communications Satellite
Directorate at Matra Marconi Space, EAST will most likely be based on
two Eurostar 3000 satellites with 12-meter unfurlable reflectors. EAST
would provide mobile telephony services to all of Europe, the Mideast
and parts of Africa. 

ORBITAL SLOT HOARDING

      One of the thorniest issues facing the satellite industry is
orbital slot crowding. "Overfiling is exploding," said Robert Jones,
director of the Radiocommunication Bureau at the ITU. 
     Jones cited two possible solutions to orbital slot crowding:
procedural and financial. The procedural solution, he said, would
involve certification of progress toward the construction and launch
of a satellite by applicants. The financial solution would entail fees
or deposits submitted with each filing, which would be returned when
the satellite is launched. 
      "Orbital slot congestion is worse in the Asia-Pacific than any
other region," emphasized Seon Jong Chung, president of the
Asia-Pacific Satellite Communication Council and vice president of the
Satellite Communications Division of South Korea's ETRI. "Nearly 120
satellite networks have not been processed.
     "Excessive filing for many years complicates limited resources,"
he continued, "and gives burdens to everybody." 
     Despite the regulatory logjam, most conference participants
predicted that the high rate of growth in new satellite systems will
continue. Steven Dorfman, president of Hughes Telecommunications and
Space Co., said he remembered not too long ago, in the 1980s, when the
demise of the satellite industry was predicted because of fiber. "Now
there are four times as many satellites in orbit as there were at the
time of that prediction," he said.
     Dorfman cited new satellite-based consumer applications, higher
power satellites, lower-cost terminals and digital compression as
drivers in satellite growth. "I believe we will continue the
double-digit growth in satellite communications as we have over the
past ten years."

BUSINESS TV APPLICATIONS VIA SATELLITE
by James Careless

      Business television (BTV): finally, the advent of digital video
compression has saved the industry from the drought of analog
satellite space. And with the sudden freedom (and reduced bandwidth)
offered by digital transmission comes a new emphasis: interactive
distance education.
     "Training by satellite has been dramatically increased by new
forms of interactivity," notes Susan Irwin, president of Irwin
Communications and acknowledged BTV "guru." "No longer is it strictly
a one-way medium. Now, with students able to voice questions and file
their responses back to teachers in real time, distance learning has
taken on a whole new power, and a whole new importance."
     To test this theory, Via Satellite surveyed a number of major
U.S. BTV users, to see what they're doing with their BTV networks.

CARRIER CORP.'S "BEAM TV"

      Carrier Corp. is the world's largest maker of air-conditioning,
refrigeration, heating and ventilation equipment. It's products are
distributed in 145 countries worldwide. As a result of this
success, Carrier needs reliable communications to keep its customers
well-served. And that's why the company turned to business TV.
     "Basically our business television network came as a result of
customer demands," says Toni Nevins, Carrier's business development
manager, when asked about the roots of Carrier's Beam TV. "We used to
have two national meetings a year, and our customers--the independent
distributors who sell our equipment--asked us to cut it down to one."
In order to continue to keep customers informed while eliminating the
need for more than one meeting a year, Carrier decided to install its
own business television network.
     "That's where Group W Network Services came in," she adds. "After
we conducted a feasibility study, they helped us install and activate
our network on April 1, 1995, in order to ensure we had another way of
getting important product information out to our customers."
     Known as "Beam TV," Carrier's BTV network supplies at least six
hours of programming a month to 116 sites in the United States and
Canada. The signals are sent out digitally using GI DigiCipher 1
equipment, and received by the sites using 1.2-meter antennas.
     The programs they receive are quite varied, says Nevins. "We do
product introductions, service bulletins, service training, corporate
communications to both employees and customers, and of course, a
monthly half-hour update on the company called `Beam News.'
     "This is scheduled to coincide with the customers' monthly sales
meetings," she continues. "They integrate the news programs into their
meetings to update their employees on Carrier information that they
may need to do their jobs.
     "Most of our broadcasts are live interactive broadcasts," she
adds, "where our customers communicate with the on-air people using a
special  1-800' telephone number."
     This last feature has already proved particularly useful in
keeping Carrier's clients happy, says Nevins. For instance, "we were
doing a major product overhaul that our customers were concerned
about. Once we knew of their concerns, we were able to go to air
within 48 hours with a live phone-in show explaining what we were
doing and why, and fielding their questions as they arose."
     For her part, Nevins is sold on the value of Beam TV. "It has a
strong cost benefit in getting a consistent message out to our
customers," she says, "while offering them to chance to voice their
own concerns. And, not incidentally, it has reduced our travel
expenses as well."

FAA's "TELE-TRAINING"

      With responsibility for critical areas such as air traffic
control and aircraft safety, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
is an agency that relies heavily on training to maintain its
standards. But recent federal budget cutbacks have put the agency in a
real bind, says the FAA's Hank Payne. 
     "From 1992 through 1996 we've seen our training budget cut by 42
percent," Payne notes, "while we've only been able to reduce our
actual training needs by 21 percent."
     Much of the expense of FAA training was the result of residential
training centers, and the travel and per diem costs associated with
sending staff to the sites. That's why in 1993 the FAA turned to AT&T
Tridom to set up its Interactive Video Tele-Training Program, in
a bid to save money while upgrading its staff's expertise.
     Payne manages the Interactive Video Tele-Training Program for the
FAA, one which uses 3.3 MHz of digitally compressed live instructional
video, voice and data fed to 34 receive sites across the country (with
another 26 due to be added soon). 
     The sites themselves are equipped with One Touch student response
keypads, so that both audio and data are relayed back to the
instructor in real time. These keypads are a product offering of One
Touch Systems Inc. of Santa Clara, CA, a supplier of interactive
learning technology. The One Touch system allows students to register
a "call" asking questions of the instructor, and lets them answer
true/false or multiple choice questions as well.
     To date, the FAA has broadcast both specialized (such as
hazardous materials inspection techniques) and general interest (such
as problem-solving) courses to its staff. By doing so, it has
discovered that teaching by satellite actually cuts approximately 25
to 33 percent off course time without any decline in student
performance.
     The reason for this, says Payne, is that residential schools
"keep staff in training eight hours a day because we're paying them
for eight hours a day, despite the fact that people don't learn well
this way. Tele-Training allows employees to get up from their desk, do
two or three hours of learning, and then return to their job--a
strategy that improves their learning ability, and cuts down on the
cost of covering for them while they're in school."

FORD'S FORDSTAR NETWORK

      Ford has been a pioneer in business TV since the early `80s,
when it set up an analog network connecting 200 to 300 of its plants
and parts depots.
     But it was the company's desire to connect all of its 6,000 North
American dealers that led it to establish the Fordstar Network, a $100
million VSAT network built using Hughes Networks Systems' technology.
     The move to Fordstar has sped up data exchange, parts ordering,
and warranty submissions, says Fordstar Manager Lawrence Conley. But
it has also meant that digitally compressed video, with all of its
benefits, has been added to the network. 
     Specifically, "we've got eight channels of full motion video
going out to our dealers," says Conley. These channels feature
distance learning courses for all types of dealer staff. In addition,
the courses are all live and interactive with remote sites using the
One Touch viewer response keypad system to relay student audio and
response data back to the teacher during sessions. 
     To say the least, Fordstar is an impressive commitment to
business television, but one that Ford firmly believes it had to make.
     "We're introducing new models at the rate of one every six weeks
worldwide," says Conley. "These new models have a lot of new
technology and new features, and training our dealer people to keep up
with them is important." BTV allows Ford to achieve such goals.
     In addition, satellite-based distance learning has drastically
reduced training costs, while actually improving the potential level
of expertise at dealer locations. That's because distance is no longer
a barrier to knowledge, thanks to the Fordstar network.

JCPENNEY'S NEW DISTANCE LEARNING NETWORK

      In 1995, retailer JCPenney was faced with a dilemma, namely what
to do with its aging analog business TV network.
     For the past nine years, the company had been running analog
broadcasts showcasing the assortments of merchandise to store managers
so that they could order for their particular stores, according to Ron
Fazio, manager of communications programs and services. However, in
1995 the company realized that sending managers the images on CD-ROM
was much more cost-effective, especially in the light of climbing
satellite costs. In addition, Fazio says the CD-ROMs were much easier
for them to manage.
     Having made the switch to CD-ROM, JCPenney had to look hard at
whether to continue operating an occasional-use analog network, since
the fundamental reason for funding it was now gone.
     However, as one need faded out, a new one came to take its place;
in this instance, the company's desire to start its own distance
learning video network.
     "It's a whole new scenario of programming aimed at saving the
company money and travel and per diems," says Fazio, "by doing all of
our training out of the home office, and relaying it to 1,230 sites
via satellite." For a company such as JCPenney, such training is
crucial, since it operates in a world of expensive high-stakes
promotion and ever-changing consumer tastes. To cope, managers
nationwide must know what to do and when, or face the economic
consequences.
     Functionally, JCPenney is relying on an outbound feed of audio,
video and graphics, and an inbound audio and data feed (from 700 of
the remote sites) from students using the One Touch response keyboard.
It's a configuration that is proving to be extremely popular among
business TV users.
     Of course, the cost of setting up such a network under analog
conditions would have been prohibitive. But thanks to the timely
arrival of digitally compressed video transmission, JCPenney was able
to cut its bandwidth requirements from one full transponder to just a
quarter.
     Driving the whole system--which was designed and installed by GE
Capital Spacenet Services--is Scientific-Atlanta's PowerVu digital
video compression uplink. Capable of compressing up to 10 channels on
a single transponder, PowerVu is both MPEG 2 and DVB compatible,
meaning that the video being delivered is, at the user end, broadcast
quality.
     "Scientific-Atlanta's equipment is the same as that used during
the Olympics," notes Fazio, "which was a real confidence builder for
us."
     Today, JCPenney is producing about 1,200 hours of distance
learning programming a year, says Fazio; that's up radically from the
400 to 500 hours of merchandising video that used to go out on its old
analog network. It indicates just how potent an application distance
learning is for a company such as JCPenney, and how important digital
video compression is to keeping business television alive.

MEDSTAR

      Medstar is a distance learning application with a social
purpose: providing rural and remotely-based physicians in North Dakota
with top-quality interactive distance learning from the School of
Medicine at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks.
     "We typically broadcast one-hour programs related to health
care," says Steve Gillespie, Medstar's coordinator of communications
services, "aimed at all the health care professions that you would
find in a small town, such as physicians, nurses, physical therapists,
and dieticians.
     "Our goal is to help small communities get better access to
things that larger communities take for granted," he adds. "This way
these professions get the continuing health care education they need,
without having to spend time and money traveling to larger centers."
     The Medstar application uses an analog network installed for it
by Satellite Network Systems. Courses are uplinked live from a
production control center at the School of Medicine.
Two cameras are used, along with graphics, which are then sent via
satellite to 35 sites across the state. These sites--usually small
hospitals--are equipped with 1.8-meter antennas, 26-inch monitors,
VCRs, and Harvard Elite audio return units. The Harvard Elite is built
by A.T. Products Inc. of Harvard, IL, a designer and manufacturer of
audioconferencing products. The Elites, which are connected to
microphones, allow students to "talk back" to the instructors via
telephone connections.
     Distance education via business TV has paid off handsomely, says
Gillespie. "Both the school and the communities involved recognize
that Medstar is a worthwhile service," he says.
"It's done very well."

RE/MAX'S NORTH AMERICAN NETWORK

      RE/MAX International Inc. is one of the few real estate
companies that has its own business TV network, says RE/MAX Vice
President of Information Technology Bruce Benham, and it's an edge the
company takes very seriously.
     The RE/MAX Satellite Network is used for a combination of
education, motivation and recruitment. 
     For instance, "we'll have live panels of RE/MAX people talking
about listings presentations," says Benham, "or how they do their
particular business in terms of how they prospect for new customers,
and what kind of materials and techniques they use, and so forth." 
     As well, RE/MAX takes pains to tape motivational speakers at its
conventions for later playback. To ensure good video and sound
quality, the company shoots these features on portable sound stages.
And the company also does live broadcasts where RE/MAX agents field
questions from prospective agents via a 1-800 telephone number.
     Technically speaking, RE/MAX transmits digitally using General
Instrument's SpectrumSaver equipment on a Broadcast
International-designed system, via Telstar 401 using 3.3 MHz of
bandwidth. At the receive end are about 1,200 sites, each equipped
with a 1.2-meter antenna. "They're anywhere from the far reaches of
Canada to the Caribbean," says Benham.
     The CLI equipment is addressable, he adds, "so once a month or
once every other month, we'll do a broadcast that's just sent to
certain parts of the country."
     Does this system work for RE/MAX? Yes, says Benham,
unequivocally: with both management and sales people impressed by the
network's content, "the system sells itself."

STATE FARM'S DISTANCE LEARNING

      State Farm Insurance Companies has recently signed-on its
"Interactive distance Learning Network" (ILN), a digitally-based
voice, audio and data system which keeps agents and employees
up-to-date on both company policies and professional education.
     "We're interested in sending a consistent message to all our
associates at the same time," explains ILN Manager Patsy Fortune. "We
want to get our promotions out in a timely manner, and we want to save
on travel expenses wherever possible."
     State Farm originates its distance learning courses from its
corporate headquarters in Bloomington, IL. Using equipment installed
by Convergent Media Systems, it sends out video, audio and graphics
via Galaxy 7 to students at 33 sites nationwide. It receives questions
via the One Touch keypad system.
     Although live, the classes offered by State Farm are anything but
off-the-cuff. 
     "It's all rehearsed and choreographed," says Fortune. In fact,
for every hour broadcast, State Farm requires four to eight hours of
rehearsal. As well, the company offers a workshop for instructors, so
that they can get a sense of how different distance education is from
conventional in-class teaching.
     "We work with the instructors to make sure the material they're
presenting is interactive, that it invites student participation,"
says Fortune. "After all, if you're just going to have a talking head,
you might as well just send out a tape."
     Although only officially launched on August 1, 1996, ILN is
already proving to be a big hit with both management and salespeople.
     "We're definitely getting a very, very positive reception from
the people taking the classes," says Fortune. "They see it as a
time-saver and a money-saver."
     As the examples we've just seen prove, business TV is not only
surviving the spectrum crunch, it's thriving, thanks to digital video
compression. However, it's also clear that another reason for its
continued health is its ability to branch out from traditional
videoconferencing to a host of new uses. 
     One thing appears certain: as technology progresses, so will the
size and scope of business TV.

BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--WHY SATELLITE DISTANCE LEARNING IS BOTH THRIVING
AND MERELY SURVIVING

by Britton Manasco
      The satellite distance learning industry is both expanding and
contracting at the same time.
The industry stands between two worlds--one vibrant and promising, one
trapped in political gridlock. 
     While the business world has embraced space-based tele-learning
technology and is investing the financial resources necessary to
create expansive new networks, the world of education faces cost and
structural issues that are preventing the rapid spread of
satellite-based learning networks. Satellite executives deserve a
clear-eyed assessment of this complex market.   

THE WORLD OF BUSINESS  

      For the immediate future, the real action in the distance
learning market is likely to revolve around the adult consumer who
wishes to upgrade his or her own skills and knowledge.
American companies now spend perhaps $100 billion on training and
education (not counting on-the-job training). Adults spend another
$200 billion to $300 billion on education at colleges, universities
and other institutions. Therefore, figures can be expected to grow as
learning becomes a lifelong pursuit. What will not expand, however, is
the individuals' available time.
That amount is fixed and the premium on it is rising precipitously.    
     Service providers who meet the individual's need to learn quickly
and conveniently can expect to reap tremendous rewards in the years to
come. Indeed, much of the funding now spent on instructural led,
classroom education is likely to shift to high-tech learning services
to meet consumer demands. Satellite-based learning services are
particularly attractive in this regard, especially if they can be
delivered direct-to-home or to the work-site. 
     Satellite services can transcend the geographical boundaries and
limits that constrain traditional education. They make a vast array of
learning opportunities available--no matter where you are. "Whether
the market is intra-enterprise or from universities to the enterprise,
we see exploding growth," says Joan Byrnes, marketing, sales and new
business development director for AT&T Skynet. (Editor's Note: As we
went to press, AT&T Skynet was purchased by Loral. When the deal is
finalized, the company will become Loral Skynet.)
     One organization that is successfully taking advantage of this
opportunity is National Technological University (NTU). Based in Fort
Collins, CO, NTU transmits advanced technical and managerial
telecourses via satellite to high-profile companies such as General
Electric, Intel, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments.
NTU's interactive programs--enabling participants to communicate with
instructors by phone, fax or e-mail--have become a critical aspect of
corporate efforts to encourage continual learning. 
     In the past decade, the number of NTU customer organizations has
risen from five to 207, the number of downlink sites has grown 16 to
993 and the number of non-credit short course enrollments (which
target people who need to strengthen or develop a special skill) has
climbed from zero to 100,000 annually. In addition, the number of
participating universities who provide content and other resources has
reached 46. NTU now has roughly 4,400 graduate course enrollments and
offers 13 master degree programs.   
     The growth has been spectacular. NTU has been able to offer an
array of educational programming to meet the growing needs of the
adult learning marketplace. NTU accomplished this in a cost-effective
way. It digitally compresses its signals at ratios of as high as 12:1
and sends them all over North America via AT&T's Telstar 401
satellite. 
     NTU's success, however, is a sign of change in the unfolding
information era. It reflects the ascendance of technical professionals
in the modern organization. Consider the numbers. In the last four
decades, the number of technical workers in America has risen 300
percent--or three times the growth rate of the overall workforce--to
20 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington,
DC. It is a segment of the workforce that is on the front lines of
organizational and technological change. 
     If technical professionals are to be effective, however, they
must continually learn new skills and competencies. "Technological
creativity today is strongly related to advanced education," says NTU
founder Lionel Baldwin. 
     Similarly, there has been significant growth in company-specific,
satellite learning networks. Some estimates suggest that there are
roughly 120 networks of this kind and more than 50,000 satellite
downlinks in North America alone. Ford Motor, for instance, has
developed a digital system (dubbed "Fordstar") that beams management,
technical and customer service-oriented telecourses to more than 6,000
dealerships. Ford executives estimate that the network will
dramatically reduce training costs that the organization absorbs each
year while expanding the number of training options. In a competitive
arena such as the automotive business, such dramatic moves can be
cost-justified and acted upon. Other companies such as K-Mart, Federal
Express and RE/MAX International have also devoted significant
resources to the development of satellite-based learning networks.
RE/MAX, for instance, is a real estate firm that transmits an array of
telecourses to 1,200 sites throughout North America and has a
potential viewing audience of 23,000 sales agents. K-Mart sends
managerial programming to 2,500 sites. And Federal Express reaches
1,000 satellite dishes. All are focused on enhancing the capabilities
of their employees while eliminating expensive classroom training (and
the travel and lodging it requires). It's unlikely that these
companies would be making such tremendous investments if they weren't
all in such highly competitive businesses. The market imperative is
clear.  
     Even the competitive higher education system is responding to
changing market demands. One of the most experienced distance learning
providers is Oklahoma State University, which operates a tele-learning
program. It transmits telecourses to students and companies throughout
the country from its base in Stillwater, OK, and has attracted
corporate clients such as Phillips Petroleum, Conoco Inc. and Seagate
Technologies.   
     On the West Coast, the California State University (CSU) system
is also reaching out via satellite. Its programs in political science,
social science and business administration, among others, are now
transmitted via Hughes Communications' Ku-band SBS 5 satellite
throughout the state of California and the rest of the country. CSUSat
uses digital compression to send two channels of video programming to
seven campuses and more than 30 receive sites. 
     "Distance learning is one way we can meet the challenge of the
coming enrollment boom," says Molly Corbett Broad, CSU executive vice
chancellor. "We don't have the physical facilities here or throughout
the system to cope with anticipated increases, but with distance
learning we can still expand access to the university. It is all part
of our strategic plan to bring CSU to the students, while enhancing
academic quality and improving productivity."  

THE WORLD OF EDUCATION 

      In the world of K-12 education, the picture is far less
attractive. "On the downside, I am a little discouraged that we have
not seen more innovation from an instructional standpoint," says
Sandra Welch, executive vice president of learning services for PBS.
"A few years ago, there was a great deal of creativity. Organizations
were creating advanced courses and we were connecting people together.
There hasn't been that kind of innovation in the last three to four
years."   She notes that the education sector is going through a
period when a lot of new technological capabilities--including
videoconferencing and the World Wide Web--are becoming available to
schools. "Schools want to experiment," she says.   
    Whereas satellite distance learning programs were offered on more
than 20 satellites a few years ago, there has been much consolidation
and abandonment of the market in the years since. Price-sensitive
educational entities have been unable to absorb stiff rate increases
for spot use. C-band rates have climbed to between $575 and $725 per
hour; Ku-band prices now range from $750 to $1,000. Grace Leone,
president of EFC Startime, a Los Angeles-based reseller of satellite
time, says that the percentage of her business devoted to distance
learning programming has shrunk from roughly 50 percent a few years
ago to about 15 percent today.  
     "What really was a vibrant, growing field in the education
industry has come to, if not a full halt, a slow pace," adds Shelly
Weinstein, president and CEO of Washington, DC-based NETO-EDSAT, a
non-profit organization representing educational institutions that
employ information technologies to deliver their products and
services.  
     Some educational leaders have publicly accused satellite
executives of greedily price gouging them. Satellite operators,
however, point out that space segment supply has shrunk in recent
years due to growing commercial demand for capacity and a limited
number of successful new launches over North America.
     The larger problem is the inability of government-run,
educational institutions to invest the money necessary to become
viable customers of satellite services. As a result, much of the new
activity in education is sponsored by states rather than school
districts or individual schools.
Satellite networks are now being funded by such states as Georgia,
Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida--all of which are part of the
"educational neighborhood" on Telstar 401 (which also includes NTU,
SERC and PBS). 
     The Florida Department of Education, for instance, expects to
make programming available to some 3,000 public school, according to
AT&T. But it's unclear what impact such broadly defined, "community"
networks can have. They often carry government and public service
messages of various sorts. They also tend to fill educational gaps in
such areas as the sciences, mathematics and foreign languages for the
most poorly served student rather than expand choices for the typical
student.
     Satellite-based education is at its best when it transports
students to distant places and generates enthusiasm for learning.
Glenn Kessler, director of legislative affairs and affiliate relations
issues at the United States Distance Learning Association, points out
that satellite-based, electronic field trips have enabled children
around the country to interactively participate in Civil War
reenactments, archaeological digs in South America, underwater
exploration efforts in several oceans and visit some of the greatest
museums on the planet. 
     Organizations such as PBS and Turner Educational Services have
been active developers of such programming. Welch mentions PBS's
recent and upcoming electronic field trips to the Costa Rican
rainforests, Ellis Island and the United Nations. Such efforts are
creating a demand among young people for better and more engaging
learning services. "Once the communication system is in place, you can
see what is possible and you are going to want it," says Kessler. And
while economic and political hurdles are the primary ones preventing
K-12 education from becoming a dynamic market for satellite services,
technical hurdles are not to be discounted. John Champagne, director
of broadcast products for network equipment provider Comsat RSI, notes
that many educators have been stymied by the question of
digitalization. In some cases, the costs of the transition from analog
to digital is deemed prohibitive. However, other institutions are
struggling to choose from a field of largely incompatible compression
technologies--whether they be provided by Scientific-Atlanta, General
Instrument, Comsat/Wegener or some other vendor. 
     Comsat RSI has created networks for Channel One (10,000 nodes),
Kentucky Educational Television (2,000 nodes) and, despite the
economic and technical challenges of potential customers, experienced
growth of between 50 to 60 percent last year. "The big thing is that
everyone will have to go digital eventually," Champagne says.   
     Of course, most of the near-term opportunities are likely to be
in business markets and, possibly, among agencies in the federal
government. The downsizing of government, presaged by the end of the
Cold War and the rise of the federal debt, has proved a surprising
opportunity for providers of distance learning capabilities. Jolly
Holden, executive marketing manager for distance learning at AT&T
Tridom, explains that the federal government's satellite training and
education network (GETN) is expected to grow from 900 downlink sites
in 1995 to 1,800 by the end of 1997 and 3,000 by the end of 1998.
Between now and then the number of telecourse hours will triple from
roughly 4,000 to about 12,000.  The network spans an array of civilian
and military agencies--everything from the Department of Energy to the
Department of Defense.

THE YEARS TO COME  

      In the years to come, satellite equipment and service providers
can be expected to focus on creating end-to-end solutions that
eliminate many of the risks and capital-investments that distance
learning customers are now forced to assume. Indeed, some companies
are beginning to introduce packages that enable organizations with
expansive networks of satellite downlinks to pay monthly service fees
and lease the equipment. As arrangements such as this become more
common, more companies and organizations--private sector and
public--will be willing to implement distance learning programs.   
     Still another promising development is the emergence of the
direct broadcast satellite business. While DBS players have for the
most part resisted calls for an "open architecture" consortium that
enables consumers to point their satellite dishes at multiple orbital
locations (see Via Satellite's June 1996 issue, "Open Architecture
DBS"), this would be an essential step if true narrowcast programming
is ever to be offered direct-to-home. This may ultimately be one
important route by which educational and learning service providers
cost-effectively reach diverse and targeted markets.
     One other route, of course, is the Internet. Satellite-based
content providers will have to incorporate dynamic, interactive,
online services into their program offerings in the years ahead if
they wish to succeed. It is no longer enough to merely transmit static
programming, especially if the objective is learning. The era of MTV
is effectively over. This is an era of multiple, reinforcing media.    
     One trend that bodes favorably for the future of distance
learning is the rise of business as a purveyor of educational
services. Stan Davis, Harvard lecturer and author of The Monster Under
the Bed (Touchstone), argues that the government school system will
become a relatively less important force in education than the
training and continual learning that occurs in the business world
during the individual's working lifetime. Due to both demographic and
economic trends, he argues, education will no longer be merely
"front-ended" in the two initial decades of a person's life. It will
at last be recognized as a lifelong pursuit. That suggests that the
market for learning is increasingly swinging toward adults with
working experience. Already, more than half of the people paying for
the services of colleges and universities are older than 25 years of
age and have entered the workforce, according Educom, a nonprofit
organization in Washington, DC that tracks higher educational trends
in the United States.
     Satellite distance learning is thriving in the open market of
business and merely surviving in the market of education. But the
smart money knows that the learning market, as a whole, represents a
tremendous economic opportunity. Satellites will unquestionably assume
a vital role in the infrastructure of the emerging knowledge economy.
Still, it's important to make distinctions and recognize that some
segments are more promising--at least, in the short term--than others.
For those who invest wisely, the learning market may turn out to be
one of the greatest business frontiers of the next century.

SATELLITE SITES ON THE WEB
by Gerald E. Oberst, Jr.

      Increasingly, the satellite industry is accessing the vast store
of information that is on the Internet, free or nearly so for the
taking. The Net can be a strong resource for regulatory or general
industry research, if you have time to play with the many different
sites that are available.
     A few practical warnings at the outset: you can spend an entire
lifetime sorting and sifting through the virtual maze of Internet
sites. Thus, surfers generally maintain a library of bookmarks for the
best or most-used sites. Some favorites are maintained by the Analysys
consulting firm in Cambridge, U.K., and the University of Michigan. 
     The "Regulator" page on the Analysys server includes links to
numerous regulatory agencies and many other topics within the domain
of telecommunications. The Michigan site is succinctly named "Telecom
Information Resources on the Internet." It is supported by the
Michigan Schools of Information and of Public Policy Studies, and
claims to provide links to over 2,000 sites. Another useful site is
"Diane's List" maintained at the U.S. National Telecommunications and
Information Administration. 
     A little Net secret is that many documents pulled up are in
formats that do not translate well into hard copy. This is a problem
if you need to download and maintain the original document. Reprinting
Internet documents, particularly those with built-in links to other
Internet documents, often requires reformatting the original. The end
result can either be difficult to read, messy, or starkly different
from the original in format and pagination. (Hint, use the "replace"
word processing function a lot to eliminate those pesky HTML codes and
useless paragraph marks.)
     Those caveats aside, the Net is a startling gold mine of
information. There are few laws or government regulations on Web
sites, the Canadian and U.S. telecoms laws being notable exceptions.
However, a large number of regulatory agencies now maintain Web sites
that can be useful for anyone working in the international arena.
     Two sites on which to focus are maintained by the U.S. Federal
Communications Commission and the International Telecommunication
Union. 
     The FCC site is a basic bookmark for the satellite researcher, of
course, since it is a quick source of recent FCC documents. You cannot
rely on it for older documents (go to the pay online databanks for
that). But for anyone outside Washington, DC, who does not obtain
hard-copy FCC documents regularly, the fcc.gov site is a great
resource.
     The Internet is now the primary source for updates on the FCC
working groups that are preparing for the World Radio Conferences
(WRCs). The FCC decided to stop preparing lengthy notices of proposed
rulemaking or notices of inquiry on WRC issues, but instead to publish
regular agendas, minutes and schedules for the various WRC working
groups. To follow the working group agendas and summaries, go to the
WRC-97 site within the International Bureau.
The International Bureau is the location for most satellite-related
items, so this is a site to "bookmark."
     The ITU maintains a treasure trove of information, but as with
most treasure hunts, there can be frustrating deadends. Some of the
most enticing documents might be available only for a fee, or to ITU
Members, or participating member companies that have passwords. Even
so, quite a few documents on current debates concerning, for example,
"paper satellites" can be found under the search term "Resolution 18"
on the function within the ITU site. The background on regulatory or
policy forums can be pulled off the Web as well.
     Even if certain documents are password protected, sometimes you
can find the same document freely available at another site within the
labyrinth of ITU levels. Unfortunately, you will not be able to access
ITU recommendations that way, since the agency wants to preserve its
ability to earn substantial revenues from selling these and other
documents to the paying public.
     One advantage of most ITU documents available on the Web is that
they suffer from fewer formatting problems than many others. ITU
documents can usually be downloaded and reprinted with little or no
reformatting. The same cannot be said for many European Commission
documents, even in the telecommunications and Information Society
area, which can suffer from messy formats.
     Want to follow the World Trade Organization telecommunications
trade talks that are reviewing how to liberalize international
satellite services? Look at the U.S. Trade Representative site. Want
to know about NASA? One of the many available places to look is the
Spacelink site. Want to keep track of satellites in orbit? There's the
site to follow site.
These sites scratch the surface of available resources, and more are
becoming available every day.

A DECADE IN VIDEOTEX COMMUNICATIONS

      With the decade of the 1980s behind us and the dawn of the
1990s on the horizon, the videotex industry is positioned for a
new beginning.  As we look back on an industry that was born 10
years ago, we see that despite a slow start, the concept of
residential electronic messaging services is beginning to come
into vogue.
      To the videotex industry, the 1980s have in many ways been a
paradox--a decade perhaps epitomized best by the old literary
line "it was the best of times--it was the worst of times."
      For those of us who now look back over the past 10 years in
the information services arena to determine the common thread
that ties together the events of that decade, the only constant
appears to have been change.
      As a fitting beginning to the decade of the 1990s, VIEWTEXT
is taking a look back on the major events, visions, and changes
of the past decade and the past year that have brought us to this
point in our industry's history.

Challenges and opportunities

      Riding the sweeping tide of the Information Age, the
consumer videotex industry was born amid much fanfare in 1981.
By the end of the 1980s, some advocates claimed at the time,
every home in America would access information services--
including news and banking--from a terminal in their living room.
As we enter the 1990s, that vision is still far from reality.
      Even by the time of the Videotex '82 conference in July of
that year, the reality of the mammoth challenge of deployment had
become apparent.
      While a number of videotex trials (Time Inc., Knight-
Ridder/AT&T, and Times Mirror) were already under way, questions
on divergent standards, consumer demand, and the service's
relationship to existing media were already being raised.
      These factors, and an insufficient residential terminal
base, had closed the book on those early trials by the late
1980s.  In the last 2 years, however, a proliferation of personal
computers in the home and RBOC gateway involvement has
resurrected the videotex concept.
      One nationwide service, the IBM/Sears joint venture Prodigy,
as well as regional services operated by Southwestern Bell and
BellSouth, Nynex, Bell Atlantic and U S West appear to be gaining
steam and may give American living rooms an intelligent window on
the world in the 1990s.
      Other developments, including ISDN and RBOC installations of
fiber-to-the-home, could also give the industry the push it needs
to realize the vision in this decade.

A new telecommunications infrastructure

      Perhaps the one event that has had the most significant
impact on the  communications marketplace is the 1982 antitrust
settlement that broke up AT&T's telecommunications empire.
      So significant were the events of that time, that the
ripples have not only been felt throughout the 1980s, but
repercussions will likely continue throughout the remainder of
the 20th century.  The AT&T-Justice Department Settlement
Agreement, signed Jan. 8, 1982, by the 2 parties, replaced the
1956 consent decree that had ended a 1949 antitrust action.
      Under the terms of that agreement, AT&T divested its 22 Bell
operating companies (BOCs), which then were required to function
as separate entities independent of AT&T.
      The BOCs, which were grouped into 7 regional holding
companies (RBOCs), retained the local exchange and exchange
access services, but were banned from engaging in manufacturing,
interexchange services, information services, or "any other
product or service, except exchange telecommunications and
exchange access service, that is not a natural monopoly service
actually regulated by tariff."
      For the first time, alternative interexchange carriers such
as MCI would be able to compete on a level playing field.  For
the price of divestiture,  AT&T retained its interexchange
business and all constraints on its dabbling in technology were
lifted--enabling AT&T to realize its dreams of moving into the
computer business.  It was, however, barred from engaging in
electronic publishing services until last year.
      When U.S. District Judge Harold Greene OK'd AT&T's bid to
enter the electronic publishing business last August, he may have
opened the door allowing the long-distance giant to offer content
in a cross-country videotex and audiotext network should it so
decide.
      In addition to freeing AT&T to provide videotex and
audiotext, the decision theoretically will also permit AT&T to
provide electronic messaging services, including E-mail,
nationally via the same transmission facility.
      Greene's decision reversed a clause in the modified final
judgment (MFJ) that for the last 7 years has blocked AT&T from
engaging in the electronic publishing business.  When the MFJ was
issued, the court reasoned that the prohibition was necessary
both because of AT&T's "de facto control of the interexchange
network, coupled with the infancy of the electronic publishing
industry" at that time.
      Greene, who also signed the order that dissected Ma Bell's
empire, would continue to play a critical role in the evolution
of the new telecommunications order throughout the remainder of
the decade.  On March 7, 1988, Greene issued a 66-page order
reversing some of the provisions of the (MFJ).
      That original order permitted the RBOCs to engage in the
transmission of information as part of a gateway to an
information service, but not in the generation or manipulation of
information content.
      Other concessions made to the RBOCs in that order included
the ability to provide electronic mail, voice storage and
retrieval, voice messaging services, and kiosk billing.
      This resulted in the entry of the RBOCs into the electronic
messaging arena in a big way.  Today, most of the RBOCs offer
gateway services and many offer electronic mail services to a
rapidly growing base of corporate clients.
      At the dawn of the 1990s, support continues to build for so-
called "free the RBOCs" proposals, and faced with the need to
address critical issues of global competitiveness and customer
service, the RBOCs appear destined for regulatory relief in the
first half of the new decade.
      Last year was a year of heavy activity for the RBOCs as they
began to stake a claim in the information services marketplace.
The Information Age officially arrived in the Omaha, Neb./Council
Bluffs, Iowa, area in November 1989, when the U S West Community
Link Gateway went on line.
      U S West joined fellow RBOCs BellSouth (the first to enter
this field), Southwestern Bell, Nynex, and Bell Atlantic in the
videotex gateway services market.  By year's end, only Pacific
Bell and Ameritech were still lacking an on-line gateway by which
their customers can gain access to electronic information and
messaging services.

Pacific Bell bows out of the videotex arena

      West Coast information service providers were dealt a severe
blow in November, when Pacific Bell abruptly cancelled its
California Online gateway project, apparently a victim of
Chairman Ginn's budget axe.  This most recent setback for the
videotex industry is reminiscent of Pacific Bell's ill-fated
Project Victoria, an ISDN trial dismantled in the spring of 1988
(VT, June 1988, p. 2).
      Roger Conrad, director of voice information and gateway
services for Pacific Bell, told VIEWTEXT, "We are deferring at
this point."

Customer needs; commercial viability

      At the time, Conrad said, "Products that we are currently
being allowed to introduce into the marketplace will not satisfy
or meet our customers' needs.  Therefore, we have concluded that
it will not be commercially viable for Pacific Bell or the
information providers that would be involved in the trial."
      Pacific Bell disassembled its estimated $1-2 million gateway
project with its 8-10 employees and re-allocated the resources to
its other projects such as voice mail, X.400, and the interactive
voice response service bureau for 976 and 900 providers.

California On-Line trial was scheduled for 1990

      The FCC had conditionally approved Pacific Bell's Comparably
Efficient Interconnection (CEI) plan to offer a videotex gateway
service, "California Online," scheduled for a market trial in the
San Francisco Bay area during the second quarter of 1990.
      Quantum Computer was to develop a user interface for the
gateway, and Vicorp Interactive System to implement the
information storage facility using a Tandem NonStop computer
system.
      Conrad laid the blame on a lack of maturity of the videotex
market which is due to insufficient PC penetration (despite a Bay
Area ubiquity of PCs that ranks among the highest in the nation),
little general public awareness, and not enough on-line
information services out there for companies.
      The project is being "put on hold" until there is
significant market development or deregulation occurs.
Deregulation is considered a very critical factor.  Although
Conrad asserted that competition with IBM/Sears joint venture
Prodigy was not part of the considerations, he did say that
Prodigy has not had the restrictions placed on it that the RBOCs
have had to endure, such as offering preferred access to some
customers, providing their own services or centralizing
operations between LATAs.
      Most of the other RBOCs appear to have acknowledged that
they must commit to the videotex market without expecting profits
in the foreseeable future.  Pacific Bell chose not to wait out
the storm under the conditions that exist today in the regulated
marketplace.

Up-to-date in Omaha with U S West

      U S West customers officially entered the information age in
November when the Community Link trial began in the Omaha, Neb.,
and Council Bluffs, Iowa, (the 2 cities are separated by a river)
metropolitan area.  U S West's marketing communications manager
Ron Dulle said that the RBOC initially targeted 70,000 customers
through a direct-mail campaign.
      Approximately 40 percent of the services on their Community
Link gateway have local applications, including grocery ordering
and delivery, municipal government, local sports, symphony,
community calendar, advertising, and so on.          By year's end, U S
West had 64 contracts with information service providers (ISPs),
Dulle told us, with more being added every week.  Because each
ISP can provide more than one service, the total number of online
services approaches the 150-175 range.
      Customers access the service through modem-equipped personal
computers or through a dumb terminal that can be either rented or
purchased from U S West.  A Community Link Center retail store
will be opened in an Omaha shopping mall, where customers can
obtain the communications devices and software necessary to
access the service.
      Philips Minitel M2 terminals, which support both Teletel and
ASCII formats, can be rented for $7.95 a month, or be purchased
for $295.  Two months free rental or a $50 dollar discount plus
free software were being offered as an introductory inducement to
start up the service.
      Emulation software from Minitel is available for IBM, Apple
II, Macintosh and Commodore, and will be available under the
Community Link label.

Bell Atlantic introduced gateways in Washington and Philadelphia

      In January of 1989, Bell Atlantic kicked off 2 gateway
trials on the East Coast.  Bell of Pennsylvania is targeting
small businesses in the Philadelphia area, while C&P Telephone is
focusing on residential customers in the Washington, D.C., metro
area.  To date, the RBOC has not attracted tremendous numbers of
users.
      The trial will continue in 1990 with more emphasis devoted
to aggressively marketing the service.   Bell Atlantic first
concentrated on enhancing its gateway service by adding 3 new
information providers (IPs) to its gateway trial (VT, May 1989,
p. 3).  Dialcom, American CitiNet Inc. and Minitel USA Inc.
together are providing more than 90 new services to the
Washington Metropolitan area adding electronic mail, tax
information, and travel information.           CitiNet's 47 services
cover a broad spectrum, from an E-mail service, American CitiNet
Mail, weekends on the road, to cultural events up in the New
England area.
      Minitel Services was providing access to an extensive array
of French and English language services by the fourth or fifth of
August, said Joseph Mazzeo, Minitel Services president.  Mazzeo
spoke of a unique French cooking class in English allowing users
to "look in the refrigerator for ingredients" and a Euro-based
database of information by the European Economic Community (EEC).
      Howard Morrison, product manager for Bell Atlantic services,
told us,  "What we learn this year will determine how we roll
this service out to other service areas.  We're looking to expand
already."
      The total number of online services reached 112 this fall,
and included a strong local orientation.  Some of the more recent
offerings include California Wine Online, GEnie, Journal
Graphics, Trademark Register, and a Washington Dating Service.
Bell Atlantic also offers an electronic messaging service that is
provided through the SprintMail (formerly Telemail) network.
      Bell Atlantic's Gateway Service is available to all
Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone residential and business
customers in the Washington metropolitan area on a 24-hour basis
via a modem and a personal computer.
      Bell Atlantic also included Prodigy's videotex services in a
residential trial of integrated services digital network (ISDN)
last summer.  This was the first inclusion on Prodigy in an ISDN
trial since the AT&T ISDN demonstration at NetPower '89.
      Prodigy's computer-based information and electronic shopping
service as well as Bell Atlantic's gateway service was offered
free of charge for the residential trial.  The advantage of using
Prodigy or Bell Atlantic's Gateway service with ISDN is the
access through a plug in a wall vs. the need for a modem, and not
tying up a voice line.
      In December, addressing a gathering of communications
managers, Bell Atlantic CEO Raymond W. Smith blasted a decision
by Judge Greene regarding intra-LATA gateways, the effect of
which requires the RBOCs to maintain separate databases in each
local access transport area (LATA) for its electronic information
gateways (See related story, p. 11).
      The Bell Atlantic CEO said the decision hurts his firm's
gateway by "raising costs considerably, and is an inefficient way
to provide information services to the public."  Smith would also
like to see an end to the restrictions on providing information
content imposed by the MFJ under the administration of Judge
Greene.

Southwestern Bell follows French example for SourceLine

      Southwestern Bell launched an ambitious gateway trial this
past year in the Houston area.  SW Bell was the first RBOC to
apply the French "Minitel" strategy by seeding the market with
12,000 terminals offered free for the first 6 months.
      The Southwestern RBOC has been working closely with U.S.
Videotel, for the provision of both terminals and services in
what sales manager Guy Miller called "the largest, most ambitious
mass market gateway trial attempted by an RBOC."  By the end of
the summer, over 15,000 customers had come aboard as on-line
subscribers, with over 10,000 of them using the "dumb" terminals.
      Southwestern Bell also went after the small businesses in
the Houston area by offering "a couple of thousand" free U.S.
Videotel minitels, said Scott Hilgeman from SW Bell.
      Offering the terminals to a small business will provide an
information retrieval base that will not tie up a computer
already committed to a specific project or person.  For small
offices that do not usually have computers to spare, this could
be an added bonus.
      Southwestern Bell expects its legislative news, group
organization information, dining locations, electronic mail,
financial news, and travel information along with the 300 other
services to attract the small businesses to its service in the
greater Houston area.

BellSouth first to videotex through unregulated subsidiary

      BellSouth's unregulated subsidiary, BellSouth Enterprises,
is zeroing in on the Atlanta marketplace with the Transtext
Universal Gateway (TUG) by using local services as a competitive
edge.  The project was begun in 1988 and the RBOC reports "good
success" with the project thus far.
      By the end of October 1989, TUG had over 50 ISPs on-line
which translates into many more services.  Customers are being
provided with what BellSouth refers to as "useful and attractive
information," such as the Alliance Theatre Co., Ask-a-Vet, chat
lines, newspapers, Grolier Encyclopedia as well as access to
Dialcom and Delphi.
      Although BellSouth was the first RBOC to introduce its
gateway at the end of August 1988, the RBOC still considers the
service new, is working on feedback, and considers itself to have
a "ubiquity that cannot be denied" in the marketplace.

Nynex introduces Info-Look gateway

      Info-Look, the public network gateway service introduced by
New York Telephone last year, offers residential and business
customers access to a wide range of information, educational,
shop-at-home services via the use of a PC or terminal, modem and
communications software, and a New York Telephone Calling Card.
      "Info-Look service dramatically changes the way people
access and use information," Walter Richard, vice president of
marketing and technology at New York Telephone, boasted.
      "For the first time, our customers can reach and interact
with a variety of services quickly and easily from their home or
office."  Over 60 services are offered to customers in the
greater New York metropolitan area, Long Island, and Westchester,
Putnam and Rockland counties.
      Charges for New York Tel's new service include the cost of
the telephone call to the gateway, plus 5 cents a minute for the
time spent to review the directory, plus the specific rates set
by the information provider (IP) for their individual services.
      Charges for Info-Look may appear separately on the New York
Telephone bill under "Data Services," or the IPs also have the
option to bill customers directly.
      Customers can block access to various services, or price
specific services by following directions on the directory.  All
access to Info-Look can be blocked, at no charge, by calling New
York Tel's business office.
      Nynex first offered the Info-Look service in Vermont,
through New England Telephone, in December of 1988.  The Vermont
gateway is serving customers throughout the state with about 100
information and consumer services.

Canadian videotex activity on the rise

     Having conquered Montreal on a market trial basis, Alex--
Bell Canada's videotex service will move on to Toronto in April
1990 with its information service.
      The company is rolling out in Toronto almost a year ahead of
schedule because of what it calls "customer interest in the
service, market demand, and the growth of the videotex support
industry."
      Last May, the videotex service had attracted almost 13,000
Montreal subscribers, and was predicting 20,000 subscribers by
the summer.
      U.S. Videotel will begin providing 50 services to Alex by
the middle of next year.  In addition to the Texas-based service
provider, La Redoute--a subsidiary of Sears Canada, Consumers
Distributing, National Pagette and Hertz Rent-A-Car have recently
signed on with Alex.

PRODIGY GROWS BY 450 PERCENT, APPROACHES 200,000 HOUSEHOLDS

     Since its launch when the service began with 35,000
households, Prodigy has attracted nearly 200,000 households, for
a total of 315,000 users, as of Dec. 31, 1989.  That translates
to a 450 percent rate of growth over the past year.
      According to President Theodore Papes, Prodigy has more than
doubled the number of member households since it entered the New
York market last spring, when membership stood at 50,000
households.
      Sources say that Sears and IBM have spent more than $700
million on Prodigy thus far, and they still have a way to go
before the service begins to run in the black.
      Prodigy has recently begun packaging its software with a
Hayes Personal Modem which is available in either a 1200 or 2400
baud version.  Although the modem is not fully functional (users
cannot dial in), the package is an attractive "turn-key" system
that provides everything a properly equipped personal computer
owner needs to get on line within 15 to 20 minutes after opening
the box.
      As it stands, the packaging of the software/modem
combination appears to have made Prodigy an appealing Christmas
gift, something the marketers no doubt anticipated, and the
service made a major sales push during the holiday season.
      Nynex, whose electronic gateway for information services
competes with Prodigy, is the first of the RBOCs to enter into a
business relationship with
the Sears/IBM-owned information service provider.
      Prodigy has negotiated bundling relationships with different
companies to enlarge its public profile.
      As far as the banking side is concerned, Prodigy has signed
an exclusive contract with Wells Fargo Bank which prohibits other
California financial institutions through 1990 from offering the
home banking service.

A growth year

      Earlier last year, Prodigy made a big splash entering new
markets in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Chicago,
and the Dallas-Ft. Worth area.
      The Twin City area of 115,0001 homes with personal computers
will also be serviced by Super Valu, a large grocery store chain.
      The Chicago area had on line 375,000 homes with personal
computers and will have NBD, Illinois banks to offer electronic
home banking on the Prodigy service.
      When Prodigy launched its new service in Chicago, it
announced it was in 85,000 households and that figure represented
2.3 persons per household using the service.
      While Prodigy's reach into the consumer marketplace in 1989
was significantly extended, it experienced a few minor setbacks.
Citizens and Southern National (C&S) of Atlanta discontinued its
home banking service, (HomEc) offered via Prodigy on Sept. 15.
      Although C&S gained nearly 50 customers a week since the
service was introduced in October 1988, Bill Van Landingham,
president of C&S in Georgia, said business priorities had been
reviewed and the bank had decided to "allocate resources now
committed to the HomEc program to other activities."
       C&S was servicing 1,100 accounts or households, Scott
Scredon, a bank spokesman, said.  Prodigy said it had 1,500
accounts, but Scredon explained that included couples using the
same account.
      VIEWTEXT learned in late July that C&S was reevaluating its
banking service with Prodigy.  Prodigy officials we contacted at
that time were not aware of the event.

Battle lines drawn in Houston

      Prodigy moved into the Houston area last year the same way
it has moved into all of its areas across the United States.  The
only difference in Houston is that Southwestern Bell Telephone
(SWBT), along with U.S. Videotel, had already staked their claim
to the greater Houston area (VT, April 1989, p. 2).
      In addition to moves into Texas, Prodigy Services Co. has
moved into Denver and Miami.  More than 125,000 homes in the
Denver area and another 140,000 homes in the Miami area with PCs
now have access to Prodigy services.  Prodigy distributed its
free start-up kits in both areas to seed the market and will, of
course, charge $49.95 for the kit after the promotion is
finished.
      The computer-based information and electronic shopping
service, which is owned by IBM and Sears, Roebuck, & Co., has
also entered into an agreement with First Interstate of Denver to
provide the banking service.  Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. of
New York will do processing for the Denver bank.
      Prodigy has not come up with a bank for the Miami area as of
yet, but it's a foregone conclusion that the information service
is looking for a banking partner for the area.
      Even sophisticated technology is not immune to occasional
outages.  A Prodigy Services Co. computer went down on May 8,
after a glitch in the software package caused the computer to
overload, and precipitate intermittent outages for the nationwide
on-line system (VT, March 1989, p. 4).
      The computer-based information and electronic shopping
service was "on and off Monday night and Tuesday," said Brian Ek
of Prodigy.
      By [early] Wednesday, "service was restored to some parts of
the nation, and by 8:00 p.m. Wednesday, the service was
completely restored," Ek added.
      Ek said the company will continue to monitor the system, but
the "fix was put in place before the peak usage time on Wednesday
night."  He said he was confident about the restoration but added
no one could promise problems would not occur again.

VIDEOTEX SERVICES FORM MARKETING CONSORTIUM TO SEED CONSUMER
MARKET

     In an effort to provide a shot in the arm to the residential
electronic messaging services marketplace, 7 key videotex
services in the United States joined forces in September 1989 to
promote consumer videotex.  VIEWTEXT discovered that the new
group, dubbed the Videotex Marketing Consortium, planed to seed
the consumer market with access terminals by selling more than
50,000 French Minitels to the regional Bell operating companies
(RBOCs) at a low cost.
      Under the tentative plan, the RBOCs would acquire the
terminals from the group and would distribute them to consumers.
The terminals would be rented at a rate of $7 to $10 per month,
although direct sales of the terminals to interested customers
would be another likely option.
      The 7 members of the consortium are BASELINE II Inc., CTL
Communications Inc., General Videotex Inc., Minitel Services Co.,
Minitel U.S.A. Inc., U.S. Videotel and Videotex Development Corp.
Additional firms are expected to join the group within the next
few weeks.
      Members of the group with services on the new Bell operating
company gateways reported seeing tremendous growth in usage in
the Southwestern Bell Houston market, which was seeded with
terminals, when compared with other markets.
      "We don't think this difference is a question of climate,"
he continued.  "The main factor separating the Houston experience
from that of Burlington, Vt.; the New York City area; Washington,
D.C.; Atlanta and Philadelphia, is that there is a strong
marketing commitment and that terminals--or access devices--are
available in Houston and nowhere else."

Negotiations under way with terminal manufacturers

      All of the members of the group have vowed to invest in the
promotion of the terminals in key Gateway markets.  The Gateway
operator in each case will be contacted to participate in the
promotion and will handle the consumer billing.
      The consortium has set aside a $20 million-plus advertising
and marketing budget to accomplish the task.
      "We got involved in videotex because our service is in the
Minitel format," Linda Brown, director of marketing and
development at Baseline II, an on-line information service for
the film and television industry and a key member of the group,
explained.
      The consortium's efforts, Brown said, will focus on trying
to "re-enact the experience in France" in which French consumers
received terminals at no cost and were charged access charges for
the on-line services they used.
      "We are convinced that the Gateway videotex market is about
to explode in the U.S.," Bruce Forgrieve of U.S. Videotel said.
      "We have proven that our services can be successful when we
work with an RBOC that has adopted a large-scale access device
and marketing strategy.  All that remains for additional success
is to get access devices into the hands of consumers.  This plan
will provide a major impetus to the birth of a new industry."
      In other videotex industry events, Robert Smith, executive
director of the Videotex Industry Association, confided that
within the next year "regional gateways will take a hard look at
gateway business."
      His biggest concern was that "senior managers will forget it
is a long-term business, and view it as short term."  The
executive director emphasized that "this is a business of the
future."  He reminded us it was clearly not a "get rich quick"
business.

THE MINITEL COMES OF AGE AND COMES TO AMERICA

      As the Minitel system in France nears a decade of service,
and boasts 4.5 million users enjoying access to 11,000 services,
France Telecom has set it sights on expanding its services
abroad.  This effort has been focused on the North American
market through its Intelmatique international division, which
includes subsidiaries Minitel USA, Minitel Services Company, and
Minitelnet Inc.
      The 11,000 videotex information services, all France Telecom
has to offer, were made available over Minitelnet Inc. to North
American users of the Minitel network on May 1.  Minitel can be
accessed from over 160 locations in the United States.
Previously, Minitelnet Inc. accessed only 1,500 information
services, and the recently added French Electronic Directory
Service, which offers 25 million white and yellow page listings
in French and English.
      A recent expansion of the Minitel system allows North
American ISPs to market their services online to the over 4
million subscribers in France.  The service is offered through a
network operated by Minitel Services Co., a partnership of
Infonet and Minitel USA.  Local access charges from cities
accross the country vary from 15 cents per minute to $1.65 per
minute.

Now available on RBOC gateways

      The French videotex services are now available on 5 of the
RBOCs' gateways, Southwestern Bell, Bell South, Nynex, U S West
and Bell Atlantic.
      The U S West gateway, which was developed in partnership
with Minitel USA, began providing services in November.  Minitel
terminals are being leased to U S West gateway users in Omaha.
      Scott Magee, director of Minitelnet, said he expected "the
number of English language services to grow" as usage increased.
He added, "We expect to be on all the RBOC gateways within a
year."

Thomas Morgan, VIA chairman, hints of more intelligent terminals

      Thomas Morgan, vice president of Quantum Computer Services
and chairman of the Videotex Industry Association (VIA), told
VIEWTEXT last spring that most RBOCs or online information
services going outside the PC arena had gone with Teletel,
Minitel or dumb terminals but "one unannounced RBOC was planning
to go with a more intelligent terminal."
      Sources concluded that the unannounced RBOC would have been
Pacific Bell, which was at that time planning its now defunct
service.
      Morgan said his company does not consider information
services a mass marketplace at the present time, but more of a PC
arena.
      Another significant issue was the calling number for gateway
services.  Numbers, of course, vary for different areas of the
country.
      Morgan said intelligent software should be able to make the
call and set up service with other intelligent software.
      The VIA president concluded that it was important to have
"acquisition [as well as] retention" of customers.  He felt that
if electronic mail could be worked off-line and be connected to
voice and fax, and international connectivity could be achieved,
progress was truly being made.
      He said he considers inter-connectivity with matching
transaction codes vital to the scheme.
      Blocking services or requiring users to fill out written
requests "ignores services that have shown response."  There are
other means of controlling a secure environment.  Morgan contends
that as more is learned, customers are more interested in price
then ONA and do not have their own network and will not have one
either.

JUDGE GREENE REFUSES INTER-LATA GATEWAY SERVICE

     One of the most significant regulatory events of 1989
concerned the future of inter-LATA videotex gateway services
provided by the RBOCs.  It hasbeen placed in question by Judge
Harold Greene's recent decision against Bell Atlantic.
      The judge's strict interpretation of the Modified Final
Judgment (MFJ) on Jan. 24, 1989, has stopped the RBOCs from
routing information services across local telephone boundaries
using a single gateway processor.
      Bell Atlantic had proposed that a customer could dial a
local node in another part of Pennsylvania and be connected with
the gateway processor in Philadelphia over a leased line.
      The central processor would then provide the customer with a
menu of service providers as well as an index of services.
      After the customer made a selection, the centrally located
gateway processor in Philadelphia would tell the local node to
make the connection with the appropriate service provider.  The
actual connection would be provided by the local telephone
company.

Greene rules architecture to be interexchange

      Greene turned down Bell Atlantic by saying it was
"inescapable that the gateway architecture Bell Atlantic is
proposing would operate on an interexchange basis, and that it
would therefore constitute an interexchange service prohibited by
section II(D)(1) of the decree."
      Bell Atlantic had claimed "the transmission provided in the
context of the gateway service did not violate the decree because
"it is analogous to the regional companies' provision of official
services across LATA boundaries which this court approved shortly
after the breakup."
      The company said the centralized arrangement was no
different from the centralized arrangements it uses to provide
existing telephone services like directory assistance which are
considered official services.
      These services were permitted by the original decree that
broke up the Bell System.
      Judge Greene concluded that "in every significant respect,
it would be the central, multi-LATA processor, that would be the
information services gateway.
      "[Therefore,] the court holds that the operation of a
centralized gateway processor is not an official service."

Centralized gateway service--a new and competitive service

      Greene added, "the centralized gateway service constituted
the heart of a new and competitive service.  On that basis alone,
the attempted analogy with official services has no reasonable
basis."
      Richard Levine, a consultant at the Touche Ross Service
Center in Washington, D.C., told VIEWTEXT that "while the judge's
decision seems to be saying 'no' to centralized use of menus,
there was a slight possibility that a region might be able to get
a narrowly founded waiver of the restriction to support a gateway
for a less populous LATA."
      Levine, an expert in telecommunications regulatory services,
said Judge Greene was concerned about allowing BOCs to operate
these centralized services.  The judge clearly did not want to
set a precedent.
      Levine did say he felt it would be "unfortunate if rural
areas were deprived of gateway services" because of the ruling.
      "Judge Greene's ruling has caused an adverse financial
effect on the BOCs' incentive to employ gateway services in
extended rural areas or smaller LATAs.  The Justice Department
has still not taken a position on the waiver.  It would be
appropriate to give some help on the ruling at this time."

Bell Atlantic's alternative: Justice Department or waiver

      A spokeswoman for Bell Atlantic said the company had "asked
for a ruling, not a waiver.  It only asked if it was a
permissible service, not for a waiver."
      The company considered Greene's stand too strong and lacking
sympathy; however, the issue has not been confronted as a waiver.
This could be an alternative to the situation as it stands.
      Bell Atlantic had the choice of going before Judge Greene or
the Justice Department to file a waiver.
      The RBOC did not think a waiver was necessary.  It had asked
the court to declare that it could use one computer to provide
gateway services throughout the entire state of Pennsylvania.
      The RBOC pointed out that such an arrangement would hold
down the cost of this service, and would provide services to
rural areas and urban centers.
      Bell Atlantic estimated that the cost of putting gateway
equipment in all 5 Pennsylvania LATAs would be approximately $2
million.
      In Bell Atlantic's LATA regions alone, the population ranges
from 200,000 customers to 5 million customers.  There are a total
of 161 LATAs in the United States.

Pacific Telesis looks to interexchange carrier

      Bill Adler, executive director of regulatory matters for
Pacific Telesis,
said his company "will be looking at the possibility of an
interexchange carrier providing any interchange services.
      "Such companies as MCI, AT&T, or other resellers would be a
possibility; California has 120 interexchange carriers operating
in the state.  The problem is they do not operate everywhere in
the state.  We feel like this might have more chance of a
success."
      Adler did say, "Bell Atlantic's proposal was more efficient
and cost-effective.  One of the drawbacks of MFJ is that it gives
engineers heartburn."
      Bell Atlantic had also been prohibited by Greene from even
leasing packet switching lines to carry inter-LATA calls to
gateways.  Thus, Pacific Telesis may turn to the interexchange
carriers as a possible answer to the problems.
      While opposition to RBOC powers continues to be the norm in
the courts, the U.S. Congress is contemplating legislation that
would provide some relief.  It is likely that some progressive
action will be taken on the issue in the coming year.

manufacturer of Category 3, Category 5, and fibre optic products for
data and telecom. According to Sanjay Soni, managing director, Logix
Microsystems, the growth of the structured cabling market has increased
the potential for Hubbell's products in the country.

Competitors for these products include AT&T, Mod-Tap, and AMP but Soni
claims that Hubbell products are of high quality and priced 25 percent
less than the competing products. Distribution will be through nine of
the Logix's network of systems integrators and resellers. This number is
likely to go up by another five by the end of the year. The company has
a projected turnover of Rs 12 crore for the current fiscal.

NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: ADVANTEC DISTRIBUTES ALLIED'S NETWORKING PRODUCTS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Advantec Network Solutions has tied up with Allied Telesyn
International, USA, for distributing the latter's networking products in
India. Allied's product range comprises low end hubs, network interface
cards, and transceivers. The products will be distributed through
Advantec's distribution channels which include around 126 systems
integrators and resellers. Though Advantec distributes hubs of UB
Networks as well, it does not see any fundamental conflict in taking up
Allied's products. For one, the primary product offering from Allied is
transceivers. Its hubs are mainly in the low end and as such do not
compete with UB's hubs which are primarily targeted at the mid range and
enterprise market. Besides, says Joshua Barton, vice-president of
Advantec, "Being a distributor and not a value-added reseller ensures
that we will not push one particular product. Sales is customer
dependent."

Additionally, to strengthen its channel network, Advantec has recently
introduced a programme, "Compass", to enable small systems integrators
to take on multi-location projects, which they could not do earlier due
to geographical or resource constraints. Advantec will play the role of
the connecting agent by partnering the small systems integrators with
other systems integrators in its network. In addition, support will be
provided through training, technical planning, and product sourcing.

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

The high-profile CMD of VSNL, BK Syngal, has been given an extension to
his tenure by another two more years. Though his extension had already
got the clearance from the appointment committee, it was delayed for
some time due to the new developments in the telecom scenario.

BK Syngal was selected for the position in 1991 for a tenure of five
years, ending June this year. Then the government extended the term
temporarily by three more months, expiring by 30 September.

Syngal is known for his vision and foresight. It looks imperative for
VSNL to have a leader like him at the helm, especially when VSNL is
looking at expanding its base in a competitive environment.

NEWS ON THE CIRCUIT: MOTOROLA'S UNIQUE DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

It comes as a part of Motorola's unique distribution strategy to
popularize pagers and the paging concept. The showroom - Kamsons Page
Shoppe - is located at Jail Road, in West Delhi. Inaugurating the
showroom, DR Mehta, president, RPG Paging, and Fernando Gomez,
vice-president and general manager, Motorola, Asia-Pacific Paging
Subscriber Division, stressed the need for providing better services and
education to the users. The showroom is expected to provide Delhites
enhanced paging awareness. It is positioned as a one-stop-shop for all
the paging requirements, which also includes the subscription collection
centre.

"We will be providing the entire range of pagers available under one
roof. Besides this, we will entertain all queries that prospective users
may have," explained VK Adlakha, managing director, Kamson Page Shoppe.

RPG has plans to open four showrooms in three cities - Ahmedabad, Delhi,
and Madras in which it is likely to be operational by December 1996.

Motorola has plans to open 35 exclusive showrooms on similar lines, in
association with paging operators by June 1997, across the country.
The recently opened showroom in Delhi is the tenth in the series of
Motorola's retail outlets in the country. Commenting on the response to
these outlets, Gomez said, "The customers' response in all these cities
has been overwhelming. In fact, the Ludhiana showroom, sold 59 pagers
on the opening day itself."

Delhi has emerged as the second largest paging market in India with over
45,000 subscribers.

CONNECT INDIA '96: A success show, going by the number of participants,
displays, and visitors

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Despite the prolonged sultriness of Delhi, Connect India '96 went off
very smoothly in the spacious air-conditioned halls of Taj Palace.
Inaugurated on 29 September by ex-DoE secretary, N Vittal, the man
behind the Telecom Policy 1994. "Connectivity is the operating word ...

Technology is giving us options, but we should make sure of its
utilizations," proposed Vittal in his inaugural speech, followed by the
cutting of ribbon to begin the show.

The companies participating in the show included most of the biggies in
the industry. Among them were Adroit Technologies, Accel Automation,
Datamatics, Elnet Technologies, HTL, Intel Asia Electronics, Intex
Technologies (India), ITI, Microsense Computers, Netran Information
Access, Pioneer Digital, Seacom Solutions, Technoware Systems, Tropicana
Enterprises, Usha Communication, Vertex Infotech, VSNL, Voxtron Dezign
Lab, and Worldwide Technologies.

Intel was greeting the visitors with its big and furnished stall. In
fact, it had put up its ad on the very threshold of the exhibition. And
the best designed stall was undoubtedly that of Microcom. The company
that seemed to have taken back its presence was Voxtron Dezign Lab. The
reason--not disclosed. Tropicana Enterprises, an associate of Kelvinator
and now the authorized dealer of AirTel services and distributor of
Casio pagers, was giving away free wrist watches when one purchased a
pager. The stall was mostly crowded with visitors peeping into for a
window shop of pagers and cell phone models.

The thrust areas of exhibition seemed to be Internet, Connectivity, and
Modems. There had been seminars going since morning till evening. The
organizations taking part in the conference included ITI, Bharti,
Qualcomm, DoT, VSNL, MTNL, NIIT, and HTL. Eminent speakers were invited
to speak on conferences. And spoke Vijay Thadani from NIIT on NII, BA
Majmudar from Qualcomm on CDMA in rural communication, RK Gupta from
VSNL on Internet and others on various other subjects.

And VSNL sponsored to take care of the gourmet's stomach in between the
long hours of conference sessions.

It was definitely a three-day mega show with visitors crowding in. The
age group ranged from little ones to elderly persons. And, the
visibility of people from the armed forces as well as police forces was
there. Making a great effort and a real success.

JB PANY - A STAR OF THE EAST

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

"Technology will eliminate the so-called physical barriers," comments
Jyoti Bhushan Pany, managing director, Radiant Electronics Ltd. Today,
FM RDS paging, Radiant, and JB Pany are really a dream team in the
Indian paging industry. Now, Radiant has its operation in 16 out of the
17 cities, where FM RDS paging is available.

JB Pany or Dulal Pany, as his friends call him lovingly, is modest,
casual, calculative, and polished. He always believes in the
theory--learn to live happily. This man from Orissa was born on 10 July
1953 in Cuttack. His father was a government servant and mother a simple
Oriya housewife, very caring and affectionate. After completing his
schooling and intermediate in Orissa he joined LIT, Nagpur, from where
he successfully completed his chemical engineering course in 1975. Then
Pany returned back to Orissa to be an entrepreneur.

His entrepreneurial strategy was simple--"get people better than you and
have faith in them". With this unique idea in mind, he started his
business in Bhubaneswar. First in 1981, he started developing aromatic
chemical, Bromostyrole. And in 1983, he formed a company, Mechem Pvt
Ltd, in collaboration with RTZ, Germany. Primarily, the company was
dealing in fibre glass and FRP. In the very next year, Mechem bagged a
major order from Nuclear Fuel Complex. However, the company also started
assembling TV sets on behalf of Surya Udyog in 1984. Giving a boost to
Pany's entrepreneurialship, his company received national award for
production excellence in 1987.

The year 1984-85 saw a major change. From chemicals the company switched
over to electronics. On 5 September 1986, Radiant Electronics Ltd was
incorporated. It is a joint sector company with Orissa State Electronics
Development Corp., in technical collaboration with C-DOT. In 1994, the
company diversified into FM RDS paging, through its division called
Radiant Connect.

He says that team work has been the key to the success of his company.
He is a man is grateful to all those who are behind his and Radiant's
success. Sam Pitroda is his role model. And, in Pany's opinion, Pitroda
is the man who shaped up Indian telecom revolution. He also gives credit
to the people of Orissa for their continuous encouragement.

On the family front too, Pany is leading a happy life. He met his better
half in Nagpur. He has all praises for her when he says, "she is more an
Oriya than a Maharastrian". She helps him in his business activities and
handles the TV assembling unit. She is also a very good wooden furniture
designer. The Pany couple has two children, a son and a daughter. Both
are studying at Dehradun.

Besides being an excellent manager, he is also a good leader. He was the
chairman of CII, Orissa. Once, travelling was his hobby. Now, it is a
necessity. He travels almost three cities in a week on business trips.

Besides travelling, he is also very fond of socializing and reading,
especially technical magazines. He loves to spend his spare time at the
golf course or in the billiards room. In fact, he has won the Jamshedpur
steel city billiards tournament too.

About his employees, he says that their union is one among the most
enlightened and disciplined ones in the country today. He feels proud of
them that they are, to some extent, the jack of all trades and the
master of FM RDS paging.

Coming to the future of FM RDS paging, he is very optimistic. And he
believes that once the nation-wide network is established, 70 percent of
country will be covered by Radiant.

With a vast experience behind him, Pany is the driving force at Radiant.
However, he is reluctant in admitting this and attributes everything to
his colleagues, saying that they are his strength. A virtue that drives
this Dulal Pany, relentlessly.

VIPIN MALHOTRA - SAW FAR, SAW GOOD

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

From TV to telecom, it is not a smooth transition normally. But then,
where there is a will, there is a way. And Vipen Malhotra,
vice-president, Arvind Telecom, is testament to this adage. A mature
face which reflects that experience has been the best teacher for him.
He wears a typical Punjabi look. Broad shoulders and a good height are a
certain plus in his personality.

Vipen was born on 11 August 1956 in Punjab. After completing his
schooling, he had his degree in electronics from Punjab Engineering
College, Chandigarh. To have a perfect combination--engineering coupled
with management--he went on to do his MBA from Punjab University. Vipen
started off his professional career as marketing executive at
Continental Devices India Ltd (CDIL) in 1980 in Ahemdabad. When CDIL
joined hands with a German company for colour TV technology transfer and
agency operations in India, Vipen turned out to be a shot in the arm for
CDIL. He managed all the affairs almost single handedly and brought in a
tremendous business for the company. He was then promoted as marketing
manager and was asked to take on an additional responsibility area. And
this was to market the CTV components which did not come with the
original kit.

He did that job well too and acquired a considerable marketshare for the
company. It was in 1986 that he came up with an idea of fusing
technology with style. To launch the range of vertical black and white
TVs. But CDIL was not ready for the investment required. And Vipen, as
ever, was a man who wanted to change with the times. He joined Arvind
Mills' electronic division as general manager, operations, in September
1987.

It was here that his life took a full turn. And it was here that his
career bloomed. Arvind Mills' telecommunication division had then
designed a small EPABX system in-house. The problem that lay ahead was
its mass production and marketing countrywide. Vipen accepted the
challenge. He worked vigorously on the project and brought down the cost
of production to a considerable level. Not satisfied with just this, he
went on to successfully sell around 250 exchanges in just a short span
of nine months. Albeit, Arvind Mills ventured late into the big and
complex arena of telecommunication, it soon became one of the big names
in rural automatic exchange manufacturing under his active leadership.
The company is on the verge of almost tripling its production of small E
PABXes.

On the workfront, his vision is to make Arvind Telecom, India's largest
suppliers of small EPABX systems and to eat a major share of the radio
trunking pie in India. "We are already in a process of establishing
ourselves in 10 cities in the trunked radio business licensed to us and
are working on making a name in the field of Public Mobile Radio Trunked
Services," says Vipen. For trunked radio, his company has a tie-up with
EF Johnson of the US.

When he is not thinking of telecom and business, he loves to watch
cricket with his elder son who is nine-and-a-half years old. In his
college times, Vipen used to be the captain of his university badminton
team and a member of the tennis team. These days, he is keen on golf. He
also likes to potter in his house garden whenever he manages to do that.

Reading happens to be another favourite pastime with him. And that is
mostly on business and modern management techniques. As far as the music
goes, he prefers golden oldies--both Western and Indian (non classical).

Wife Radhika was earlier into ethnic dress designing, but with the birth
of his second son who is two-and-a-half years old now, she prefers
devoting full time to the family for Vipen.

Things were not easy initially, but then he climbed the heights. Rightly
said, its all in the attitude. Coupled with aptitude. And he is a fine
example.

PAGING - THE VOICE MATTERS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

The operators' job is not a dull one, after all. There is excitement and
fun, as well.

Every telecom service segment--cellular, E-mail, or VSAT--calls for its
own skillset. What makes paging so special, however, is that in the
actual service-delivering, no other communication service involves human
beings. In paging, the interface with the customer is a voice. And much
of the subscriber perception emanates from the voice.

The more live and vibrant the voice, the better it is. A disembodied
mechanical voice is a complete put off. Says Sandip Das, CEO, Hutchison
Max Telecom (MaxPage), "The human interface holds a great deal of
importance in the Indian context." Apparently, research into Asians and
their interaction has revealed that Asians relate much better to humans
than machines. It is in this context that the role of a paging operator
becomes critical. Besides, in the Indian context, the operator's role
carries more importance as operator-assisted paging is more popular in
comparison to automatic paging. A paging operator has to do more than
just receive and send messages.

Once they receive a message, the paging operators have to verify it
while keying the message simultaneously into the computer in front of
them and send it off. The job carries a lot more responsibility; the
voice has to convey a sense of reliability and also sustain the
freshness and vibrancy through the day. All the senses should be alert
as she has to listen to the message and enter it on the terminal
simultaneously. Besides, they are required to have multi-lingual skills
to translate messages. For instance, when a message comes in Marathi,
the operator should be in a position to translate and enter it in
English on the spot. Hence, knowledge of at least two languages,
depending upon the location, is a prerequisite for this job.

Surely, sitting in front of a terminal eight hours a day, constantly
listening to messages and sending them after a double check, cannot be
all that exciting. Instead, it is bound to be taxing and tiring. So the
onus of keeping the paging operators motivated lies with the employer,
as the quality and performance of the people who form the "voice" will
determine to a large extent the success of the service provider. So the
key is to keep the voice as good as possible. For as much time as
possible. That is what every paging operating company is trying to do.

It is an HRD exercise of a different sort.

It could vary from designating paging operators as paging officers to
providing them with cafeteria and rest room with TV and music system to
relax. While on one hand, the designation bestows the operators with a
sense of dignity, the restroom helps these operators to take a break in
the midst of their gruelling day. For, on an average, an operator
handles around 50-60 calls an hour. During peak hours, this number is
likely to go up by 50 percent.

On an average, an operator handles around 50-60 calls an hour. During
peak hours, this number is likely to go up by 50 per cent.

Running through most of the service providers, the sops offered are more
or less similar. For instance, all of them have introduced uniforms to
impart a sense of uniformity and to eliminate any differences that may
have surfaced due to economic or cultural factors. The distinctive
flavours come in the form of throwing open the field to employees to
design their uniforms, like in the case of MaxPage, which changes the
uniform every six months. What it does promote a sense of belonging and
pride in the organization. Says Sandra Mahadwar, head (human resources),
MaxPage, "They are able to give their expression to their
creative urgings."

Nearly all of them arrange outdoor activities which could be sports like
at RPG Paging or picnics at DSS Communications. In a city like Mumbai,
Pagepoint Services, a Motorola joint venture, adds a dash of excitement
by having a bash at a disco. Here, the operators have an opportunity to
socialize not only among themselves but also with the rest of the
company staff which brings about a team feeling. In addition to these,
there are in-house magazines and cultural events. Modelling for the
company is also not ruled out. For all its advertisements, MaxPage has
roped in only its employees to model.

Despite the similarity, most go a little further in different ways. For
instance, at RPG Paging Services, Madras, a recreation club has been set
up within the office premises equipped with exercycle, indoor sports,
and aerobic facilities. Pagepoint follows a five-day week pattern for
all its employees, including the paging operators. Says Micheal Latimer,
president, Pagepoint Services, "They have two days to themselves, to
relax and get ready for another hectic week and as they are an integral
part of Pagepoint there is no reason why they shouldn't enjoy similar
benefits."

All of these become relevant in the light of the fact that most
operators--on an average 60 percent--are women. Some, like MaxPage, have
a 100 percent women workforce in some select cities like Bangalore and
Mumbai. The night shifts are usually managed by male operators with some
exceptions like at MaxPage in Bangalore and Mumbai. Says Suresh
Srinivasan, general manager, Pagepoint Services, "It is purely for
safety reasons that we have men in the night shift as then transport and
security are not an issue." Despite this, MaxPage prefers to have women
on the rolls. It does add a bit to their expense list, given that they
have a duty officer and security staff during night shifts.

We put people ahead of paging

Besides, they pick and drop their "officers" outside their doorstep.
MaxPage even encourages the applicants to bring their parents along when
called for an interview. While the candidate is undergoing the
interview, parents are given a tour of the office and shown the
facilities that will be provided to a paging officer.

Now moves like these come handy, specially in small cities like Ludhiana
which tend to be conservative and where parents are not as open to
sending their "girls" to work. It is precisely for these reasons that
most service providers have men in their night shift. Though at RPG,
women working in the last shift between 12.15 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. are
entitled to a car drop back home, women working in the last shift is
generally avoided. Says Preetha R Ramakrishnan, assistant manager
(personnel and administration), RPG Paging, "Due to personal
constraints, women are not asked to work at night."

We believe we should trust and respect our employees

Apart from these, operators are given awards and incentives in order to
motivate them to perform better. Most of them have fairly elaborate
monitoring system. Based on the observation, the operator is given a
feedback and the freedom to evolve a self correcting process. "This,
says Latimer, "helps operators perceive their role better." The ultimate
aim is getting the operators to understand that they play a key role in
satisfying the customer. And, hence, the efforts of the company are
directed towards this goal. Pagepoint has an award for the "best paging
operator" for the week, month, and year. Apart from that incentives are
given, based on various parameters both qualitative and quantitative.

These also help in taking the drudgery and monotony of the job. Unlike
other jobs, an operator's job (in spite of being called paging officers)
does not provide too many avenues for growth within the organization.

Not that they cannot opt for anything else. Sure they can go from being
an operator to a shift supervisor or they could move into other areas
like customer service or finance, depending on their preferences and
capabilities.

Well, given the competitive nature of business today, most
companies--service and non--service--have come to realize that the cost
of training a fresher is disproportionate to the money spent on these
activities, which have long-term benefit. However, in the paging
industry, it takes more preeminence because of the "people intensive"
operations and more dependance on the human factor than the technology.
Given these, the attrition rate among paging operators is very low.

They all claim that none of them have lost any of their operators to
competitors. Of course, poaching is against IPSA rules. The rule is not
a law in itself but more of a gentlemen's agreement. Most of them claim
to have lost paging operators not due to the nature of the job but more
due to personal reasons like marriage. In fact, the nature of the job or
working in shifts have not been a deterrent for many is the general
refrain.

The working environment created and policies have had their effect on
manpower turnover and also in recruitment. According to Latimer,
"Initially, recruitment was through the medium of advertisements but
today it has shifted to word-of-mouth and referrals. All the propaganda
is done by the paging operators themselves." And this Latimer attributes
to the excellent atmosphere created within the company.

No doubt, the companies have had to spend in order to create the
"comfort zone". But it is a cost that has been factored in at the time
of budgeting for infrastructure. However, none of them is willing to
reveal just what percentage it took up of the entire investment. One
reason for this advance planning could be that all the service providers
have joint ventures going with MNC partners. These partners carry with
them their experiences in other countries.

A lot has been written and said about paging as an industry but little
has been discussed about the human face of the operations, the
occupational hazards, and how companies are taking care of their
employees. In Das' words, "As far as India goes, our vision proved
right. A strong service orientation is the right approach as hardware is
incidental to business." And human resources is inextricably linked to
this vision which is reflected across the paging industry.

"WE LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE OPEN TO CHANGE"

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

What does Ericsson look for in its prospective employees. And why? How
does it develop a positive feeling among employees? Ranjit Bhatia,
general manager and chief (human resources & administration), Ericsson
Telecommunications, explains in an interview with Shyamanuja Das.

What are the qualities that you look for in a person while recruiting?
We look for people who are more flexible to change. Particularly, when
we recruit experienced people, we always look for people who are not
very rigid. But for people who will embrace change. Because that is
Ericsson culture. That is how this industry is. You have to be open to
change. You have to be in constant lookout for change. For new options.
New styles. New environments.

What is your policy on recruiting fresh graduates?

We do not go to campuses. Recruiting from campuses is good. But it is
time consuming. The average time is eight months. Who has got that kind
of time in this industry? Last year, when we recruited in bulk, we
advertised for fresh candidates.

How important is the label of a college/university?

Depends on the nature of job. I can go for an IIT graduate, if I am
recruiting someone for a planning kind of job. For a hands-on job, we
prefer graduates from other engineering colleges.

What about marketing and other such functions?

Almost for all marketing positions, we recruit engineers. And that too,
only electronics and telecommunication engineers. The concept of
marketing is slightly different in this industry. We are not selling
consumer products. We are selling solutions to operators. That requires
not only an understanding of technology, but also knowledge of what can
be offered to the customer as a solution. It is more of business
development than marketing. We cannot afford to take a non-engineer.
Only for publicity etc., we take MBAs.

Where do you get middle level people from?

Engineers from PSUs, C-DOT, etc. have joined us. For marketing, we
develop our own people. There is no other way out. They are given
responsibility at a quite young age. Our average age in marketing is
28-30 years.

What are the problems you face, if at all, while recruiting?

Getting good field support staff is a problem. Very few people have the
customer orientation that this kind of job demands.

How do you manage to get good people in an extremely competitive
recruitment market?

Let me clarify on one point. We pay well. (But) we are not the best
paymasters. We do not try to be. Our objective is to be a very good
employer. We look at providing all comforts to an employee. We encourage
decision making. Above all, he is respected as an individual.

We conduct training programmes for the employee's overall growth. We are
now carrying out a continuous training programme as a project, with
active participation from our Sweden office. It is called Competence
Management and it aims to help an employee develop business competence,
technical competence, and human values. We also send them abroad for
technical trainings.

With a certain degree of pride, I can say that there has been negligible
employee turnover in Ericsson in recent months.

In general, what are the positive and negative factors in the
recruitment scenario in India?

One thing good about India is the availability of people, not necessarily
skilled, but who can be trained. The basic education is good in India.
In software, we have got skilled people.

On the flip side, people here are very low on accountability and
customer orientation. Accountability can only be built into the system
if we put thrust on it in our educational system, itself. Now, one way
of doing that is better co-operation between the campus and corporate.

In a market-driven world, that is a necessity. Then, we won't keep on
training our youngsters on something in the campus and something else in
the job. There will be no duplication of efforts.

HOW HCL GROUP RECRUIT ITS PEOPLE

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

"We do not recruit for individual companies because we want to ensure
movability within the group."

How does HCL Corp., known for its high people-orientation, recruit its
people? Sujit Baksi, the company's director & president, HRD, tells
Shyamanuja Das.

What is the basic recruitment principle of HCL Corp.?

We believe in recruiting freshers and developing them. We recruit
globally. In Singapore, Thailand, UK, US, and of course India. We take
engineers and MBAs from premier engineering and management institutes
and colleges.

How common or different are your recruitment procedures for different
group companies?

We do not recruit for HCL-HP or HCL Comnet. We recruit for HCL Corp.
Basic skill requirements for a marketing person or a technical support
person is similar in all the companies, barring a few R&D jobs. So a
fresher is taken for HCL Corp. We do that because we want to ensure a
high degree of movability within the group. Our recruitment, hence, is
function-oriented, not company oriented.

Why at all is there a need for that?

IT is a very flexible industry. Only thing that is constant here is
change. Tomorrow, we may enter some new business, exit from something
else. The person must be ready to handle different jobs, different
situations.

How do you find such people?

We look for some basic attitudes. A logical and analytical bent of mind
is a necessity. And we look for persons with high tolerance for
ambiguity. The person must be adaptive. He should be able to adapt to
changes. To new jobs. To new people. To new countries. Also, we look for
people who have motivation to achieve. This is in addition to the
specific skills required for the job and academics. We give a lot of
importance to academics. We believe academic records say a lot about the
student.

What is a typical recruitment process in HCL Corp.?

As I told you earlier, we take only freshers. We go to institutes like
IIMs, FMS, and Bajaj among management institutes. For engineering
graduates, we go to IITs, BITS, and selected RECs.

The entire process takes about one year. In fact, for our July '97
recruitment, we have already started in June last. We organize meets
with students where our top management goes and talks about the company
and the kind of opportunities that lie. Shiv Nadar himself has gone and
spoken. This year, we are planning to start this exercise in October.
Ex-students of these schools also go to campuses.

Once a student is selected, he is treated as an employee of the company.
From getting a B'day card to receiving information regarding the
activities of the company, he is made to feel as a member of the HCL
family. We also organize periodical visits of these students to company.

What are the problems you face?

Of course, sometimes there are certain mind blocks. HCL is perceived to
be a hardware company, though that is far from truth. We are second only
to TCS in software. And those who want a cushy kind of job, we cannot
provide. Right from day one, you have to be hands-on. Another fear that
is there is HCL is a very task-oriented company, which is a fact. So one
wanting a secure, slow job is not a typical HCL fit-in.

In spite of best of your efforts, there must be some people who will
fail to deliver...

They will have to go. No matter how thorough is the selection procedure,
there will always be some people who will be like that. That number is
very small in HCL. (But) they have no place. We cannot carry passengers.

It is perceived that some group companies like NIIT and HCL Comnet are
more employee-friendly than others like HCL Frontline and even HCL-HP...

I don't agree. There is a common policy. If someone has tried something
successfully in one of the companies, we implement that in other
companies. (So) there is no scope for any discrepancy. For finding out
what is best in each company we regularly conduct meetings called BIG
(Best In Group), where the chiefs of companies meet and discuss what
they have tried.

There is a belief that there is a mad rush towards telecom from all
other fields. And the biggest loser is IT. What is your observation.

What does this mean for HCL?

I agree that IT is losing a lot of skilled manpower to telecom. But for
a group like HCL, where there is enough scope to work in the latter, I
do not think that is a major problem. Our employee turnover has been
very low.(But) at the same time, I must admit that a few of them have
left and joined some MNCs.

COMMUNICATION CAREER - A COMPELLING ISSUE

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

WE Indians believe that we have one of the best technical manpower in
the world. Quite rightly too. Various surveys and studies have
reaffirmed this fact from time to time, the latest being the World
Economic Forum (WEF) Report On Global Competitiveness. India ranks among
the top three nations in the world in terms of availability and quality
of engineers.

Yet, finding right people still remains the toughest job for the
corporates--multinationals and Indian companies alike. And vice versa.
Unemployment is not a problem anymore, at least, for professional
degree/diploma holders. Misemployment is. Unless that is checked, it has
the potential to have a negative effect on the workforce in particular
and the growth of Indian business in general.

Let us define misemployment. In short, it is the wrong employer-employee
association. With higher level of professional knowledge and better
skillset, the expected level of satisfaction from one's job has gone up
tremendously. So has the employer's expectation from the employee. For
the best results, a perfect sync between attitudes of the employee and
the employer is a must. If there is a mismatch, there is bound to be
problem. That qualifies for a misemployment.

If the employers and employee do not choose each other carefully before
their association, it backfires. While employers have large HRD
departments doing the job, very few employees do that. As a result,
there is dissatisfaction that results in frequent job changes, stress,
and a fall in productivity level. The sole culprit is information. Or
rather, the lack of it.

The turnover and the product profile of a company are not the best
information to act on for making a career move into a company. One need
to know about the culture of a company, what are the qualities that the
company looks for, and what kind of a person will fit well into that
organization, before taking any decision on joining it.

These are the kind of information that we will provide you in this new
section COMCAREERS. The HRD chiefs of companies will directly tell you
what their companies look for and who is the right kind of person, and
what is expected of him. From time to time, we will throw light on areas
in which there are information gaps. This time, we have interviews with
HRD chiefs of two different types of companies. One is a fully Indian
transnational, HCL Corp.; other is a typical joint venture between an
European and an Indian company, Ericsson Telecommunications Ltd. The
size, the working culture, the strengths, all are different. Plus, there
is a feature on paging operators that tries to remove many
misconceptions.

Feel free to write to us if you want to read about any particular issue
regarding recruitment, training, and other related areas.

SAYING IT THROUGH NUMBERS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

On the silver screen, the Hollywood hero uses his code, ILU, ILU. On the
LCD screen of your spouse's pager, you can use your own code. And that
could be a number.

That is exactly what the Chinese are doing. Many Chinese use a numeric
pager because it is cheap and numeric paging is easy to automate. So for
saying I Love You, it could be 111. For I love you too, it could be 222,
and so on. But how to remember so many codes? They have got a little
cute book of codes, known popularly as Bible Of Paging, where these
codes are listed. There are so many of them. The book is distributed by
the paging operators.

In India, some companies are already talking of that. So the next time
you want to say something, you perhaps will have the option of saying it
through numbers. But we have to evolve our own code. The Chinese code
for You are the nicest person I know could well be 420.

TEST AND INVEST: Unearthing of the telecom scam has led to scrips falling
at much more faster rate than other industries

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

The telecom scam has delivered a body blow to the liberalization
process. The telecom scrips that were considered to be favourites have
no demand in the exchanges. The result is a continuous fall in the
prices. Telecom scrips have been falling at much more faster rate than
other industries. The small investor has lost confidence, which will
take time to build up.

After the presentation of union budget by the finance minister, the
market has been gradually sliding downwards. The downslide of the equity
shares is far more than what is reflected in the sensex. Scrips of new
companies which have entered the capital market recently either do not
find there quotations or most of them get traded in the range of Rs 1 or
2 in a day. Even their volumes are not exceeding 100-200 shares. The
budget has proved out to be disastrous for the stock market.

Introduction of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) has deeply shaken the
confidence of investors. Stock market analysts are predicting that it
may take, almost, an year for the sentiments to improve.

The debt market has improved considerably and the institutions like
ICICI, IDBI, IFCI, and SCICI have already mobilized around Rs 6,000
crore and thus the money has been squeezed from the investor by the debt
instruments. There is no money left for the equity
instruments. Meanwhile, the deposit rate war between the non-banking
finance companies have intensified. Companies have started offering up
to 18 percent interest. While PAL Credit & Capital has announced its
interest rates of 17.5 percent for one year and 19 percent for four to
five years, Reliance Capital's rates are 15 percent and 18 percent,
respectively, for one and three years.

The BSE Sensex fell by 2 percent as it closed at 3,349.30 points on 20
September. Out of the total 58 shares listed, 48 went down, sensex 7
moved up, and three closed with no change. Datacom segment was the worst
affected as shares went down by 55 percent. Datapro went down by 90
percent and ICNET by 55 percent. Telephone cables is the worst
performing stock in telecom industry and is ranked fourth in list of top
5 losers in all companies listed in the exchanges. The share is quoting
at Rs 9 as against Rs 69 six months back.

The controversy over the VSNL's Euro issue has taken a new turn as the
Ministry of Telecommunication is suspecting a foul play in the
appointment of lead managers to the issue. The lead managers to the
issue are currently Kleinwort Benson, Jardine Flemming, and Salomon
Brothers and the company hopes to raise $700 through the issue. The
ministry suspects that more underwriting commission has been agreed in
case of VSNL. The controversy has certainly reversed the sentiments of
the investors.

Meanwhile, the board of directors of VSNL has proposed a 45 percent
dividend for 1995-96. The company has emerged amongst the top 10
tax-paying corporates in the country. It paid Rs 369.31 crore as
corporate tax.

A select few heavy-weighted scrips rallied smartly in a mixed pattern of
trading on the BSE. In general, the trend was downwards. Investors are
concentrating more on the debt market, resulting in brokers also
shifting their focus to the same.

BSE's decision to revamp the sensex has been hailed by the marketmen.
The inclusion of public sector stocks and giving weightage to new
sectors of the economy is the step in the right direction. The sensex
now will give the true picture of economy. The old sensex represented 19
percent of the market capitalization. A total of 15 new scrips have
replaced the old ones.

The Primary market in August was again deluge with a number of small
offers. The total mobilization through public offers during the month
fell to Rs 363 crore in August 1996 as against Rs 1,675 crore in July
and Rs 675 crore in May. However, the number of offers continued to be
high with as many as 87 companies tapping the market in August, 99 in
July, and 127 in June. Premium offers continued to remain out of sight
in August too. Only 11 out of the 87 offered were at the premium, with
the only Apcotex (Rs 105) and Super Auto (Rs 70) in high premium.

One of the major factors which supported the fall of the market is
SEBI's directive to extend the mark-to-market margin system to the
non-computerized stock exchanges. Because of this, the volumes declined
last month by 46 percent over the previous month.

As several companies are announcing book closures, the supply of the
stocks in the market will be reduced. Some stocks because of the
manipulation might increase for the shorter time frame. One should
carefully examine these stocks and avoid investments in these.

GLOBE WATCH: THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS FOR TELECOM REFORMS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

His name is Reed Hundt. He almost decides what the AT&Ts, Sprints, US
Wests, and Bell Atlantics should do in the next few years.

Sometimes, he also auctions air waves. For a change, he is now preaching
what other nations should do. Given below are his seven commandments.

I. Privatization does not conflict with or substitute for the rules of
competition.

II. Any nation that champions a national telecom firm and limits foreign
investment is wasting its money and turning down a big opportunity.

III. When governments intervene in markets in the name of guaranteeing
universal service, they generally do not make anything universal and
they do not enhance telecom service.

IV. Every country does not need two redundant wireline networks.

V. If you are not awarding spectrum licences by auction, you are making
a big mistake.

VI. After you auction the licences, let the market work. Systems rivalry

desegregation or combination of spectrum licences.

VII. The right goal for international communications is the same as the
goal for domestic communications--no more regulation of communications
services than of soap or software or shoes.

Telefonica took office in November 1990 and the phone density, then, was

has risen by 66.67 percent. The telecom company feels that such a growth
has been primarily due to heavy investment in telecom infrastructure
during the period. It was around $4.5 billion.

SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

A strategy, based on market segmentation, is essential to focus in an
evolving market.

When Nobel-laureate EF Schumacher wrote Small Is Beautiful (As If People
Mattered), cellular was certainly not in his mind. But the cellular
operators are fast realizing that small is indeed beautiful. Perhaps
much more beautiful than Schumacher imagined.

When cellular licences were being awarded, there was so much glamour and
clamour for the Mumbai licence. Most aggressive forecasts, bids, and
what not! Some even thought the rest was a waste. Today, Delhi has the
lead. Whether it is maximum number of cars or cell-phones, it is the same
success story of small entrepreneurs behind them.

Recently, we were on a search for a small office building ... there were
brokers and brokers but with a common factor ... all had a cell-phone,
in fact some had two, one from each of the two operators ... just in
case! When we looked for furniture ... again the same common factor. A
conspicuous cell-phone. The common factor stretches beyond ... our
lawyer carries one, our CA carries one, our freight agent carries one.

No wonder it is the small wonder!

But for now, we leave aside the small wonder called cellphone ... and
talk about the success story of the small business. Small business has
come to mean big business to cellular operators. Not only world-wide,
but in India too!

Delhi is obviously the trend setter in India. Today, travelling in a
Bombay suburban train if one sees a combination of "chappals" and
"cell-phone", one cannot afford to scoff.

The Innovators

Most operators tend to launch with testimonial ads. Focus: Corporate Big
Wigs! No doubt almost all CEOs become the first subscribers though I
know several dogged exceptions. But where do the real numbers, usage,
and revenue come from? It is from the humble pockets of small businesses
with employees less than 10 sometimes; we include the self-employed too.

In the first year of service, over 95 percent of the revenue may come
from this segment. For cellular, small is big. Big market. It may take
sometime for cellphones to travel down the corporate echelons.

In the "consumer" segment, it takes two to three years to reach
"significant" level of penetration and airtime usage. We know, most
people prefer to charge to official account. Consumer segment will
mostly comprise of housewives, college going youngsters, and old people.
Majority go for it as "status symbol" or "snob value" and sometimes for
"security" reasons, mostly with very low airtime usage.

The Global Scenario

Today, small businesses and corporate segments account for about 70
percent of world cellular market and the consumer segment less than 30
percent. In some "not so highly dense" markets with about 10-12 percent
(still quite big for us) penetration, small businesses have been seen to
reach a cellular penetration of about 50 percent. While in "highly
dense" market like Sweden with 30 percent cellular penetration, small
businesses (less than 15 employees) have 85 percent penetration. Need we
say more?

The Cellular Way To Business

Cellular changes the way to business for a small businessman as he
learns to manage his time better--the cellular way. With a cellphone he
virtually carries his office around. Office and telephone do not tie him
down anymore. He could devote more time with his clients and in
travelling. For operator, it requires a customized concept selling to
address and target each of sub-segments based on the pattern of daily
activities which may differ for exporters, doctors, CAs, lawyers, estate
agents, freight agents, courier services, contractors, etc. It may
include specialized promotion for specific professions highlighting how
the service can help in improving efficiency and business. In Delhi, I
am told that almost 100 custom-agents subscribed to service en masse,
even the same model of handset.

Today, traveling in a Bombay suburban train if one sees a combination of
"chappals" and "cell-phone", one cannot afford to scoff. It is not just
the basic unit of economic fabric but also the "big" star of cellular
world. Schumacher wrote, "There is wisdom in the smallness if only on
account of the smallness and patchiness of human knowledge... It is more
important that everybody should produce something than that a few people
should each produce a great deal... The task is to bring into existence
millions of new work places in the rural areas and small towns."
"Cellular will play a leading role in this task in India," Mr
Schumacher, "we assure you."

NEPOSTEL CONSULTANCY BV - CASHING IN ON TRAINING

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

With lot of private telecom operators starting their operations, the
company is eyeing a huge business opportunity. Reason enough for it
being in serious business.

Nepostel is the member of the KPN Group (Royal PTT Nederland NV). And,
it was founded in 1981 to offer Telecom and Postal Training and
Consultant Services to telecom and postal operators and service
providers using the expertise of PTT Telecom and PTT Post.

PTT Telecom, the Netherlands, is one of the most productive telecom
companies in the competitive market of Europe. Since its foundation,
Nepostel has worked in more than 50 countries in former Eastern Europe,
Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The turnover of the company expressed
in Indian currency was Rs 56 crore in 1995, which is 10 percent more
than that in 1994.

Nepostel's relation with Indian customers dates back to 1991 when two
telecom managers attended a course--Management of Operations and
Maintenance of Modern Telecom Networks in the Netherlands. Since then,
Nepostel has formed a joint venture company called Orange Telecom
Software with TCIL for the development of telecom software locally,
which caters to the European market. Billing software and other customer
care software for the private telecom network operators seem to be the
major areas of operation for Orange Telecom Software.

Nepostel has also been instrumental in providing back-up consultancy for
a Videotex project in Delhi. It has provided training and consultant
services to Sterling Cellular and HFCL. Around 13 network engineers of
HFCL were trained by Nepostel in the Netherlands last year. The company
is the foreign collaborator in Beltron Telecommunications Ltd, a paging
operator with licences in six cities.

Nepostel's services have been delivered up till now through its
headquarters in the Hague. Currently, Nepostel is in the process of
setting up shop in India together with its partner, Svana Systems (P)
Ltd, in New Delhi. This joint venture company called Nepostel India Pvt
Ltd will be operational soon. It has been registered but is in a wait
for formal government approval. According to the company sources,
Nepostel India Pvt Ltd is expected to be launched by 15 October 1996.

Svana Systems, a small time telecom software developer itself, will now
be involved in project execution and marketing of all the ventures of
Nepostel in the country. "Project execution, not product development, is
and will remain our forte," says Shugan C Jain of Svana Systems. "There
is a lot of technical expertise available in the country, but managing
them together and bring business out of it is not an easy job. It
requires expert consultancy and thus justifies our existence," adds Jan
Joosten, senior consultant (training and organization), Nepostel.

Nepostel is an expert organization in feasibility studies, network
designs, consultancy for bid evaluation in a telecom tender, buying
decisions for network equipment, etc.

Till the time this venture comes into picture, Nepostel has already
started to deliver its services through Svana Systems. "In the near
future, we are planning to bring the best of training facilities in
India itself, rather than taking the Indian engineers to the
Netherlands," says Jain.

The first tangible result of this co-operation is a series of five open
courses for executives and managers of various telecom operators.
Nepostel focuses on all aspects of running a telecom network
effectively, whether fixed, GSM, paging, VSAT, MRTS, or other. Dutch
experts with hands-on experience in all aspects of telecom will carry
out or back-up the services offered by the newly hired staff of the
joint venture. The main aim is to deliver the highest quality of
training and consultancy in telecom and posts based on thorough
knowledge of the telecom and postal businesses and hands-on experience
of its consultants and trainers.

USHA COMMUNICATION - THE JUMBO IN MAKING

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

With the ever expanding officecom segment, Usha Communication is a
company to watch.

If you think foresight is the key to success of any business, it is true
of Usha Communication. "As a corporate, we think eight years in
advance," says Jai Dhar Gupta, managing director, Usha Electronics. This
Delhi-based company was established way back in 1968, with a product
focus of manufacturing telephones, intercoms, and small analogue
switches.

Right now, the company is into the manufacturing of state-of-the-art
ISBX systems. For this, it has entered into an alliance with Tadiran
Telecommunications, Israel, to manufacture and market its Coral brand of
ISBX, a technically advanced EPABX system. This Coral Automatic Call
Distribution (ACD) helps users by evenly distributing incoming calls,
and keeping track of calling patterns and performances. Manufacturing
these locally will give the company a tremendous cost advantage. The
other products are Coral Computer Telephony Interface (CTI), Coral AIR
(Wireless EPABX), and Coral ISDN PABX. The Coral ISDN PABX provides wide
bandwidth for voice, data networking, and videoconferencing. These ISDN
exchanges are fourth generation PBXes that will support voice, data,
video, wireless facilities, cellular facilities, voice mail as well as
ISDN and VSAT connectivity. The Coral AIR handset is like a wireless
extension.

The company has also entered an alliance with Cosmopolitan Electronics
of Taiwan for smaller PBXes with a capacity to handle 240 lines at a
time. The most modern thing about this is that this has a single pair
wire and also a digital one.

"Now hotel and paging are the two areas where there is lot of
opportunity," comments Gupta. And, that is why the company is targeting
these industries. Till date, Punwire is its major client. Usha
Electronics has installed EPABXes both for its POCSAG and FM RDS paging
services. And, very recently, the company has bagged its first order
from the hotel industry, i.e. Hotel Bright Star, which is coming up in
Delhi. It has also installed ISBX systems at Western Pagers and bagged
orders from Jindal and Oswal Group.

Among Public Sector Units, Indian Railway is their major client.
Everyday, 16-17 voice conferences take place between different offices
of the railways and Usha has to provide adequate facilities for this on
leased line voice conference. Apart from these areas, the company is
also trying to enter areas like banking and telecom. Other prospective
customers are from the banking and financial sectors, PSUs, and courier
industry. "We are looking forward for at least 20,000 connections,"
says Gupta. The company has already set up five EPABXes so far, and
expects to set up 18 more in near future.

"Customer satisfaction is our main look out," comes out Gupta. To ensure
this commitment, the company has a chain of 60 dealers, 10 branch
offices, agents located in almost all big and small cities across the
country. It also plans to open sales offices in the African and South
Asian regions. And, a team from Tadiran are in Delhi and Mumbai to sell
its products.

Usha Electronics' manufacturing unit at Okhla Industrial Area in New
Delhi has already into production. Very recently, the company has set up
its second unit at Bari Brahma near Jammu, complying with ISO 9001
standards, to manufacture and assemble digital ISDN customer premises
equipment for the Indian market. This will be the first of its kind in
the country to manufacture Integrated Services Business Exchanges
(ISBXes).

Gupta agrees with Voice & Data's prediction and says that communication
software is where future lies and his company will also move into
software development. According to him, his company will move into
computer telephony as they will have a market in 50 countries and also
sees the growth of networking market in India. With an expected turnover
of Rs 20 crore for the current fiscal, against Rs 9 crore in 1995-96,
Usha Communication is poised to find a new helm in the Indian
communications industry.

VSNL - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS GATEWAY

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Long-term focus and better project executions place VSNL in the numero
uno spot.

Instability of world grandeur is not concurrent with Videsh Sanchar
Nigam Ltd (VSNL), the exclusive provider of public international telecom
services in India. Its is a steady journey of success and innovation
throughout.

And, for the government too, it is a preferred entity over MTNL. This is
obvious from the government's keen interest in keeping its stake high,
even after the expected GDR issue--66 percent. In the case of MTNL, the
government's stake is already down to 65 percent.

Now a bit history. The origin of India's external telecommunication is
actually dated back to as early as 1870 with the formation of British
India Submarine Telegraph Company. In 1872, Eastern Telegraph Company
(ETC) was formed. Fifty-one years down the lane, in 1923, another
company--Indian Radio Telegraph Company (IRT)--was formed.

Circa 1932. And, ETC and IRT merged into one--Indian Radio & Cable
Communications Company (IRCC). With Independence, IRCC was nationalized
and rechristened to Overseas Communications Service (OCS) in 1947.
March 1986 saw the conversion of OCS into an autonomous business
unit--VSNL--to improve operating performance.

In 1992, the government reduced equity holding to 82 percent and
increased private ownership to 18 percent. The expected GDR issue will
increase the private ownership to above 34 percent, still retaining the
government control. However, at the time of this article going to print,
the government has announced a disinvestment of another 7 percent of
VSNL's equity.

Services

As a service company, VSNL's area of operation is spread into basic
services and specialized services. And, it generates 95 percent of its
revenues from the international long distance services. The second
largest revenue earner is leased channels which contribute only 1.6
percent to the total revenue.

Under the umbrella name basic services, it has telephone services to 237
ISD destinations; telex services to 238 IXSD destinations; and telegraph
to 33 destinations.

Going by the specialized services, VSNL is into TV (programme
transmission), videoconferencing (home country direct), and
multi-address press broadcast (time and frequency transmission). Also,
it offers leased channels services such as bureaufax, T-Fax, Intelsat
business service, and Inmarsat mobile services. Its specialized services
also include Gateway Packet Data Search Transmission, Electronic Data
Interchange (EDI), On-line Data "Easynet", and E-mail (Gems 400) through
its Internet backbone.

VSNL's international gateways are two-fold. One, satellite earth
stations and two, sub-marine telephone links. The former has stations in
Arvi, Bangalore, Calcutta, Dehradun, Madras, Mumbai, and New Delhi.

In sub-marine telephone cable links, it has both wide-band sub-marine
cable analogue and digital systems. Under the wide-band sub-marine cable
analogue system, it has two gateways--Madras for IOCOM Cable to Penang
in Malaysia and Mumbai for Gulf Cable to Fujairah in UAE, with a length
of 2,509 km and 1,964 km, respectively. The digital system--SEA ME WE
2--has a length of 17,658 km, having covering points in countries such
as Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, France, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
and Sri Lanka. Mumbai is the gateway for this service. This facility was
commissioned in June 1994. The total cost involved in this was Rs 2,204
crore. As on 30 April 196, VSNL had 2,814 circuits in this service.

Coming to the mobile communication services, VSNL deals in voice, data,
and fax for the marine, air line, and land mobile communities. Its
Inmarsat mobile satellite communication services is the focal point of
all these operations.

International Association

VSNL's association with international bodies like Intelsat and Inmarsat
has enhanced its image in India and abroad, alike. It is a founder
member of Inmarsat, an organization dealing with mobile communications,
with other 77 countries, having a share of 1.48 percent in the
consortium. Similarly, in Intelsat, a set-up of 138 countries for
satellite services, too, VSNL could forge in 2.12 percent share for
India. And, in Intelsat and Inmarsat consortia, VSNL is, respectively,
the tenth and eighth largest operator in the world. It also has
participation in the international joint venture ICO Global
Communications to provide global satellite private communication
services. Through VSNL, India has put in an investment of 7.38 percent
of the total project cost.

The company's association with Commonwealth Telecom Organization (CTO),
Asia Pacific Telecommunity (APT), and International Telecommunications
Union (ITU) gives it an unequivocal edge. It actively participates in
the events conducted by these bodies.

It has MoUs with BT-MCI for Concert Packet Switched Services, Tele Media
International for the introduction of Universal Connect, Sprint
International, and Cable & Wireless to enhance globally managed network
and data services. Further, VSNL's success in bidding for the location
for ICO Global Satellite System's satellite access nodes gives a boost
to its international image.

By introducing Internet services on a commercial basis, VSNL has
registered a customer base of over 8,000 subscribers. It is planning to
offer companies, facilities to host home pages on the VSNL Web servers.

It is expected to further facilitate Internet usage in the country. This
service may also see tariff reduction.

The company is looking forward to participate in two sub-marine fibre
cable projects: FLAG and SEA-ME-WE-3. It also plans for laying down a
high-capacity under sea cable, linking the neighbouring countries and
providing them connectivity with other international sub-marine systems.

In the Iridium global personal satellite communications project too,
VSNL is also to participate. And, it has set up the Iridium gateway in
Pune, at a cost of Rs 50 crore. However, this will not affect its
participation in Intelsat and Inmarsat consortia.

VSNL has got into the value-added services too. With Telstra, it has
formed a joint venture--Telstra V-Comm--to provide DAMA VSAT services.
Also it found a partner in Elnet, Madras, to provide domestic E-mail
services.

VSNL is, no doubt, an unchallenged entity in the international
telecommunications services at least until the year 2004. In a reformed
era too, it is a protected monopoly. However, this status does not stop
VSNL from aiming high. Quite unusual to many Indian PSUs, VSNL has a
corporate vision and it foresees changes and tries to manage such
changes well in time. It is being reiterated by its turnover of Rs 4,417
crore for 1995-96 registering 22.46 percent growth over the previous
year. Recently, the VSNL board has proposed a dividend of 45 percent.

Its present stature is mainly due to its visions and foresight than a
monopoly entity. Thanks are due to BK Syngal, the present CMD, for his
foresight and leadership. He has proven for VSNL and many PSU heads a
role model. Recently, when I met one of his senior colleagues, that
person had all praises for the CMD, quite strange in a PSU set-up.

However, this synergy could have been put to a stumbling block if he was
not given an extension. Now, Syngal will be in the driver's seat for two
more years as the government has given him an extension, recently. It
is, no doubt an acknowledgement to his contribution.

VSNL has scored in man power management too. When job attrition is a
common feature across the IT and communication industries, more so with
the arrival of MNCs. According to Amitabh Kumar, director (operations),
VSNL, through better pay packages and welfare schemes, his company could
keep its forte safely. It experienced very little man power turnover
unlike many government/autonomous entity.

Aiming high is VSNL's all time agenda. So are its strategies. VSNL is
determined to live beyond the present expectation. And, for this, Syngal
and his men are in the forefront with all good project arsenals.

RURAL TELECOM - A CHALLENGING TASK AHEAD

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Modern technologies and streamlined policies can ensure better telecom
links to rural India.

The present rural telecommunication scenario reminds me of the story of
the elephant and seven blind men. Every one views the rural
telecommunication market differently depending on which angle he is
looking at it from. Going by the sheer size of the rural population,
there should be a very sizeable demand for telephones in the rural
areas. However, as one looks at the economic conditions in these areas
and the average spending power of the population, the demand appears to
be very low. The remoteness and the geographical spread of these areas
make planning of communications a very challenging and complex task.

Modern technologies provide many solutions for the communication
requirements of the rural sector but the costs involved coupled with the
low expected returns are daunting indeed.

Some of the solutions like Wireless In Local Loop (WILL) are being
projected as the panacea for the rural telecommunications problem but
one would need an indepth study to decide whether these are economically
viable for areas with such low population density and whether it will be
possible to support these sophisticated technologies in such remote
areas unless our own people in these areas are trained to maintain these
systems after the installation teams have done their jobs and gone back
to the comforts of their highly developed countries. It is most unlikely
that even our own trained engineers/technicians will choose to serve in
the rural areas.

The government, on its part, has taken the easy way out by laying down
that the private basic service providers will have to install 10 percent
of their total capacity in the rural areas. It has also specified that
wires will not be used in the network. The basic service providers who
are, as it is, struggling hard to cope with other problems like
financing and inter-connect agreement are desperately trying to work out
how they can make their ventures profitable. Many of them are hoping
that sooner or later the government will dilute this requirement.

It is not that no one has been able to see the rural telecommunication
sector in its correct prospective. At least for the past four years or
so, a number of enlightened experts have been debating on the issues and
the complexities related to the rural telecommunication requirements.
But what is being done falls well short of the requirement.

Rural Areas: Some Basic Facts

There appears to be no formal definition of a rural area. However, BS
Murthy in his book "A Phone In Every Village" published by TRC,
Government of India, November 1987, defines the rural area as an area
where the population is less than 5,000 with a population density less
than 400 person per sq. km and with less than 75 percent of the male
population employed in the non-agricultural sector. The average
population of a village is about 1,200 and typical distances between
villages range from 3 to 10 km. A typical household in a developing
country has four to five members. Generally, a household can afford to
spend only 5 percent of its annual income on a telephone. Going by the
current rentals of telephones, this means that if a household has a
telephone and pays only the rental of Rs 2,280 per annum, it must have
an annual income of Rs 45,600. The government has a target of providing
one public telephone for every 500 people.

There are about 6.3 lakh villages in the country. Of this, only 2.16
lakh have a Village Public Telephone (VPT). There are, however, 20 lakh
telephones in the rural sector which has a population of roughly 70
crore. Thus, in the rural sector, the average number of phones is 0.3
percent against the national average of 1.2 percent of the population.

As against this, the average in the sub-urban and urban sector is 6
percent which is 20 times higher. This disparity certainly needs to be
minimized if we have to work towards achieving economic development of
our backward and rural areas. There is an outstanding requirement of
nearly 4.14 lakh VPTs. The government has plans to provide a VPT in
every village by 1997. However, its annual target for the year 1996-97
is only 75,000. It appears that the objective will not be achieved for
the next four to five years. It will take even longer to meet the target
of one public telephone for every 500 people which even by current
statistics comes to nearly 15 lakh telephones. The burden of providing
these will, therefore, shift to the private operators. They will not
find it economical to provide one in each village.

Unless cost-effective solutions are found for meeting these
requirements, it will not be financially viable for any company or even
the government to establish the requisite infrastructure.

Technology Perspective

The government is looking at a number of technological solutions to the
requirement of communications in the rural sector. Use of VSATs,
microwave equipment, ultra high frequency radio links, WILL, and
multi-access radio are some of the approaches presently being adopted.

Indeed an appropriate mix of these approaches based on the peculiarities
of the terrain and the demographics of the areas will have to be
employed to find the right solution. This is easier said than done
because of the economics of each of these technologies.

The critical factors that need to be considered while planning a network
for the rural sector are:

* Existing network architecture
* Subscriber density
* Equipment costs
* Ease of installation and use
* Power supply requirement
* Reliability, maintenance, and repair
* Growth capability of the network
* Frequency management.

As brought out earlier, subscriber density in rural areas is expected to
be low. Since the population density is less than 400 per sq. km and the
present average is 0.3 per 100, the expected density in these areas will
be less than 1.2 per sq. km.

As far as costs go, the average costs per line presently being taken for
planning purposes is Rs 40,000 per line. In the rural areas, however,
the cost is expected to be more. Many of the private operators are
working on costs of Rs 60,000 to Rs 1 lakh per line. Ideally, the cost
should be kept below Rs 40,000.

Low power requirement, ease of repair and maintenance with remote
diagnostics and repair capability are important considerations in a
country like India. While use of solar cells is advocated as the ideal
solution for power requirement in remote areas, the cost of these
remains prohibitively high. The planning figure is roughly Rs 3 lakh per
KVA of capital investment.

Frequency management has been a serious problem in our country. There is
an on-going debate about the critical shortage in the RF spectrum for
the existing requirement of the operators of cellular, paging, and
mobile radio trunking networks. The Defence forces have been under
pressure from various government agencies to release some of the
frequencies which they are holding but not utilizing in peace time.

However, they cannot risk doing this because they cannot be assured of
the availability of the frequencies if and when required during
hostilities. With more and more technological sophistication being
introduced in our weapons, surveillance, and communication systems, the
demand for the frequency spectrum cannot possibly decrease.

Conventional Wireline

Wireline will continue to be an alternative for the subscriber loop,
although only for short distances approaching 1 km.

Satellite Communications

Remote users who are dispersed over wide areas can be served by using
satellite technologies. Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC), Multiple
Channel Per Carrier (MCPC), and VSAT technology, however, are often
expensive compared with terrestrial systems. A number of satellite
communication companies are working on solutions which will hopefully,
bring down the price of satellite communications to $500-1,000.

In larger rural communities that are far removed from major switching
centres, satellite links are effective in providing trunk circuit to
individual smaller rural switching exchanges, rather than individual
subscriber loops. A terrestrial wireless local loop system can be
integrated with low capacity satellite system, providing a
cost-effective solution.

Point To Multipoint Terrestrial Technologies

Point to Multipoint Time Division Multiple Access (PMP TDMA) is a proven
rural distribution system that finds optimum use for serving clusters of
rural subscribers, using wireless for the local loop. New features,
frequency bands, and capacities are continually being developed, with
each system optimized for specific rural needs.

Low capacity analog systems have been available for many years. Analog
multi-access systems are used primarily in isolated low capacity
applications, typically serving up to 50 subscribers from individual
radio base stations. In India, a 2/15 MAAR system, at present, costs
approximately Rs 80,000 per channel. Digital system when introduced will
cost even more though they would provide higher quality telephone
service.

Fixed Cellular And Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephony

A number of companies are offering solutions based on fixed GSM, CDMA,
and Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephony (DECT) technologies. Trials are
being conducted by Qualcomm on CDMA in India. IIT Madras has developed a
DECT technology which promises to be cost effective though costs are not
indicated as yet. DoT has signed an MoU with National Semi Conductors of
USA for a DECT technology which it predicts will cost only Rs 500-10,000
per line. However, the subscriber density for which these costs are
applicable is not known. Thus, it would be seen that while a number of
technologies are in the offing the economics are not being clearly
projected. Hopefully, the prices will come down once the volumes are
taken into consideration and once the multinationals realize that India
may soon find its own solutions.

Need For Adopting A Pragmatic Approach

In a seminar organized by CII in December 1992, N Vittal, the then DoT
secretary, had made some very useful and practical suggestions for
improving telecommunications in the rural sector. Since then he has
expressed his views on a number of occasions through different
platforms. Some of the suggestions made by him merit serious
consideration. The main theme underlying in all his suggestions is to
remove all kinds of artificial restrictions that are presently imposed,
i.e. * Only one additional service provider for basic services in each
circle * VSATs are not permitted to be connected to PSTN network *
Dedicated networks of major organization like Railways, Defence, NTPC,
and ONGC cannot be shared by any of the private service providers. They
can only use DoT's infrastructure * Only specified technologies approved
by DoT can be deployed by private service providers.

Each of these restrictions hampers growth of the telecommunication
infrastructure. Another suggestion which he had made in 1992 was to
channelize the black money (and there is plenty of it in the country)
into developing the rural telecommunication infrastructure.

It is very heartening to see that the present government has laid
special emphasis on developing the rural infrastructure in its Common
Minimum Programme. The allocation for the rural infrastructure in the
9th Plan has been increased from Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore. It
is now for the telecommunication fraternity as a whole to grab the
opportunities presented by the rural telecommunication market, taking
the long-term benefits, both for the nation and the telecommunication
business, into consideration.

Fixed cellular

Using fixed cellular instead of copper wire to connect homes and offices
has several advantages.

* Speed of installation. Subscribers can be connected immediately
when supplied with an antenna unit that connects to an ordinary telephone
* Low maintenance. The absence of wires means fewer potential problems
than are found with wire-based networks in both rural and urban environments
* Flexibility. Fixed cellular can be used as an interim measure ahead of
fixed network construction, with the radio equipment transferred to
another location once the fixed network has been established.

Maitland report

A document entitled the "Missing Link" produced in 1984 by an
international commission headed by Sir Donald Maitland lays down the UN
Policy towards telecommunications development.

In January 1995, a proposal of the 1984 Maitland Commission to create
World Tel, a specialized funding body for telecommunications development
in the world's poorest countries, was finally given the go-ahead. To
some, it represents the last chance for significant progress in this
area during for the foreseeable future. This body is now headed by Sam
Pitroda who pioneered the spread of telecommunications to the rural
areas in India.

Distorted economics

It is generally argued by most basic service providers that providing
services in rural areas is going to be a loss-making proposition for
them. However, their projections may be some what exaggerated with a
view to seek subsidies from the government. A number of factors support
this view.

* Modern technology offers cheaper alternatives to physically
wiring up every remote customer. These products are more reliable and so
require less maintenance. Maintenance costs in rural areas are lower
than those in city environments where carrying out repairs can involve
complex and disruptive work beneath busy streets. City networks are also
more likely to be damaged by other utilities while digging up the
streets
* Methods of calculating the per subscriber costs and revenue in
rural areas often disregard revenue generated by incoming calls made to
rural users.

ENHANCED SERVICES A CUT ABOVE THE REST

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Through enhanced services, operators are trying to differentiate
themselves from their parallels.

Today, one can find more than one operator available for any kind of a
telecom service. Be it cellular, paging, or yet-to-be-privatized basic
telephony. The subscribers remaining the same, the question is who will
eat a bigger chunk of the service pie. With competition getting hotter
day-by-day, the operators of different telecom networks are striving to
prove their edge over others. Others, who are out in the arena providing
something similar. One sure way out has been providing enhanced services
or value-added services, as some prefer to call it.

To the delight of the operators, enhanced services can be integrated
smoothly, without any major changes in the installed networks.

Technically also, these support virtually all network interfaces, all
current protocols, and standards including those specific to particular
countries. Thus protecting any investments already made, which is a
major issue in any technology upgradation. And in the interest of the
common user, for whom all this translates into better connectivity and
true value for money.

Market For Enhanced Services

DoT had started the car phone service and even the paging service long
back. But it turned out be a total fiasco, as the public gave it a cold
shoulder. Not that these services were not good technically or
otherwise, as they are now, but all because of the lack of an emphatic
marketing savvy and mass awareness. DoT was, and still seems to be
oblivious of the fact that the first phase in selling anything is the
market development. And that comes through educating the customers, by
reaching them, and telling what it is. Indian Paging Service Association
(IPSA) is promoting and selling the concept of paging in a mega way. "In
fact, there are numerous enhanced services that can be provided along
with the routine paging service. But it is unnecessary to inundate the
market and confuse the customers. Educating the people should be given
the priority," says Praveen Kumar, president, IPSA. Essar Cellphone in
Delhi has come up with "Personalized Services" to attract the
subscribers. According to company officials, it is like having a
personal secretary working for you, outside your office, round the
clock. AirTel, too, hasn't lagged behind in jumping into the bandwagon.

It all started with flashing of cricket scores on pagers during the
World Cup 96. Even, AirTel had introduced a special number service to
keep the cellphone users updated with the latest in the action-packed
matches. And, when the election fever was on a high, the latest
standings were continuously being flashed by some of the paging
operators. Soon one will see the operators providing more such
information. "The sensex and forex update will take some time to be on
the air round-the-clock. But the paging operators are giving a serious
thought at providing other value-added information, for instance, stock
market briefings, airline schedules, railway time tables, etc.," feels
OP Suri, senior vice-president (operations), DSS Mobile Communications,
a Delhi-based paging operator.

"These will surely go a long way in developing the market and will, in a
way, benefit the individual operators also to lure the subscribers,"
adds he.

Roaming arrangements between the various cellular and paging operators
is also becoming quite popular. Recently, nine cellular operators, four
from metros and five from the yet-to-be operational state circles, have
come together to form "World 1 Network". This is to provide efficient
roaming between their respective territories. The cellphone user can do
with a single SIM card, without having to go for separate ones, as in
plastic roaming. "Follow Me Paging" introduced by RPG is in association
with Motorola's Hotline Paging. You can be paged locally, within the
city you are visiting. And that too, at the cost of a local call. And
surprisingly, nothing changes even your pager number remains the same.

Voicemail is just one of the enhanced services that the operators
provide these days, but it is catching on very fast as compared to other
enhancements. Not only the cellular operators but paging operators are
also in an endeavor to incorporate it into their networks. Mobilink has
become the first service to provide Voicemail facility on pagers. It is
also providing vernacular messaging in three languages--Hindi, Punjabi,
and Tamil."Interestingly, enhanced services can be introduced at a cost,
which is just 1-2 percent of the total cost required to lay a telecom
network.

Some players in the field providing these enhanced services are Boston
Technology, Brite, Centigram, Comverse, Glenyare, and Octel," says Bonny
Singh, manager (telecom), IIS Infotech. His company has been appointed
as a master distributor in India by Boston Technology Inc., a leader in
these services world-wide. The personalized services for Essar have been
integrated into their network by Comverse, Israel.

How can enhanced services change the lifestyle of an Indian on the move.
Let us take a closer look at these new offerings that are and can be
made available to the Indian users.

Virtual Telephone: In many regions around the world, the demand for
basic telephone outstrips the connections being provided. And India is
no exception to this situation. Virtual telephone, a yet-to-be exploited
service seems to be the answer. It is like having a telephone connection
at your place, without physically having an instrument. Though it is not
the panacea for all the connectivity problems.

It is an efficient tool for reaching out people living in:
areas with poor customer access network those on long waiting list for the
telephone service those in areas struck by natural disasters, causing
disruptions in the infrastructure and small businesses who need 24-hour
messaging capability.

A 7-10 digit number is assigned to the subscribers of the virtual
telephone service. This offers them access to a private and secure voice
messaging mailbox. It is just like dialing a conventional telephone. The
caller hears a greeting or a specific message, pre-recorded by the
subscriber whenever he dials into the network. Subscribers can access
the mailbox through a payphone and retrieve their messages anytime. A
key feature that can be added is the ability to provide timely
notification to the subscriber, when they have messages waiting for
retrieval. The message centre at the network can automatically alert the
subscriber via a pager, if programmed to do so.

Voice Mail Service (VMS): Based on electronic voice messaging technique,
this service is available to the users through our very own MTNL. It
provides for recording, storing, and retrieval of voice messages. The
voice is first digitized and then stored in an Electronic Voice Mail Box
(EVMB), which actually is a memory space in the disc of custom-designed
central computer of the VMS. For recording the voice messages, these
EVMBs can be accessed by anyone--whether he is a VMS customer or
not--anytime through a direct telephone (local or long distance) and
extensions of PABXes (through junction lines). For retrieval, however,
bonafide customers of VMS only can access their individual EVMBs through
the use of a secret Personal Identification Number (PIN), which can be
selected and changed by the customer at his will.

Optional facilities that are bundled with the VMS are:

- incoming calls to a number, served by an electronic exchange, can be
  transferred to any other telephone and also to any EVMB
- restricting the access to selected callers only, by giving a secret
  password to them
- choice of an EVMB number
- quick scan of beginning of all messages
- elective retrieval of all messages
- redirect messages (with or without comment) to other EVMBs
- broadcasting voice messages to several mail boxes
  closed user group.

Call Answering: With today's fast-paced work and leisure schedules,
people demand the ability to capture messages from incoming calls,
whenever they are away from their home or office. And this is surely
going to give the answering machine market a big blow. It is like a
separate answering machines for each subscriber fitted into the network.

But in real, there is no machine present physically. It is the network
which does it all. It is like your personal secretary, working
round-the-clock for you, outside your office, claim some of the cellular
operators who provide this service.

Enhanced services can be integrated smoothly, without any major changes
in the installed networks.

The subscribers are allotted an EVMB which can gather the incoming
messages when the line is busy or remains unattended for a certain
specified duration. With the touch of a button, the callers can:

- mark a message urgent (which places it into the high priority queue)
- review a message
- re-record a message
- cancel the message completely.

Once the subscriber logs into his EVMB, he can with a simple keystroke:

* listen to all messages
* listen to selected messages skipping others
* pause while listening to a message
* go back or move forward while listening to a message
* save or delete messages
* check the time and date of message deposit.

Submailbox: This allows the subscribers to create several mailboxes for
a single telephone line. Many people/ departments can share a phone line
and still enjoy the privacy of a personal EVMB.

Call Hold/Waiting: This facility lets you receive incoming calls even
when your telephone is busy. You get a short duration pip tone when you
are busy talking, indicating that another call is waiting for you. You
can talk to either of the callers, keeping the other on hold. There is
complete secrecy of communication between the two callers. In Essar's
network, the service helps the subscriber to handle three calls at the
same time, without any of them getting the engaged tone. The subscriber
has the freedom of attending calls at his own priority.

The basic telephony will soon get privatized. With the cellular and the
paging networks getting operational in state-wide circles along with
major cities, the industry will witness a burgeoning demand for these
enhanced services. By the present operators and the operators-to-be. In
a stride, to add more names to their subscriber database, and make their
services more feature-rich, what these operators will end-up doing is to
make life easier for the end-user.

GSM Networks-associated Enhanced Services:

Short Message Service:

This is a text messaging function for use in digital wireless network.

The caller composes a brief text message that is delivered to the
subscriber's properly equipped wireless handset. It can be configured to
take messages through an operator or via a voice menu. This facility
helps your cellphone to double as pager by giving you an option to send
or receive messages in a written form. Thereby, circumventing the need
of unnecessary conversation specially when the incoming calls are also
being charged.

Roaming: It is specially designed for people who frequently travel to
other cities. You can be reached anywhere, if your operator has an
arrangement with the operator of that place.

Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP): A characteristic of the
Intelligent Networks. The caller's number gets displayed on the LCD
screen before the subscriber answers the call. If the phone is connected
to the local computer and some memory augmentation is done, the computer
can display a scroll of information about the caller, before the
subscriber attends the call.

Calling Line Identification Restriction: The calling subscriber can
prevent his number being presented on the called subscriber's phone
(prevention of CLIP). However, it will be overridden by certain agencies
such as police and fire, since they need to know the identity of the
caller.

Advice Of Charge: The amount charged for the call can get displayed on
the subscriber's phone screen in the form of call units.

Call Transfer/Call Forward: The call can be routed to another specified
number or even an EVMB conditionally, if the called subscriber is not
available (or doesn't answer the call). This can be facilitated after
few rings or directly without any wait.

Paging-associated Enhanced Services

Twin Line service: A business line and a personal line number is given
to the subscriber opting for it. To separate the business messages from
the personal ones.

Sequential Numbering: All messages are sequentially numbered allowing
the subscribers to have a control on the messages missed.

Reminder Service: You can remind yourself appointment/ schedules for the
day or future dates by getting yourself paged from the operator of the
paging service.

Special Instructions: Special instructions can be given to the operator
to convey to your callers, anything which you decide. This could be for
instance change of your telephone number/address or for that matter your
being out of station.

Time And Date Stamping: These tell the subscriber when and on what date
the message was sent to them.

Priority Paging: The messages can be prioritized by jumping the queue
and thus can be entertained on an out-of-turn basis by the operator.

Repeat Paging: The subscriber can ask the operator for being paged twice
everytime, to be doubly sure.

MOBILE SATELLITE SYSTEMS

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Call them PSMNs--Public Skyline Mobile Networks. Mobile Satellite
Systems, MSSes for short, promise to change the way all of us live.
Communication does miracles. It brings people closer. For a change, it
is now bringing satellites closer, to earth. Yes, communication
satellites today do not necessarily mean INSATs and INTELSATs, revolving
at an altitude of 35,000 km. They are now closer to us; much smaller,
and of course, much smarter. Soon, they will be crowding the skies.

By the turn of the century, more than a hundred of them would be
orbiting around the earth. Above a distance of as low as 400 km. These
are called the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, to distinguish them
from the traditional communication satellites like INSAT and INTELSAT,
often called geostationary satellites. Then, there are satellites that
can be placed at a distance of between 8,000 and 11,000 km, with similar
kind of functionalities. Placed between the high orbit geostationary and
low-orbit LEO satellites, these are expectedly called Medium Earth Orbit
(MEO) satellites.

MSSes are constellations of LEOs or MEOs aiming to provide mobile
communication services to millions of users around the globe. Most of
these systems will be operational by a time as early as mid-1998. At
least, seven such systems have been promised by different consortia.
Three of them are being talked about, simply because they have already
got the FCC approval in the US. Iridium is a 66-LEO project of a
consortium led by Motorola. Globalstar is a 48-LEO project to be jointly
put by Loral and Qualcomm, with different companies having service
rights for different regions. ICO is a 12-MEO project by an Inmarsat
subsidiary company. All the three are expected to be operational by
1998.

The others are Odyssey, a 12-MEO project; and Aries, a 48-LEO project
and Ellipso, a 24-satellite (combination of LEOs and MEOs) project.
Odyssey, though not in a very advanced stage of planning and
fund-raising, and the other two, deferred by FCC, also hope to start
operation in the same time frame as the FCC-approved systems. Then,
there is the grand plan by two celebrities--Craig McCaw and Bill
Gates--to start Teledesic, a project involving 840 (No, the figure is
not a printing mistake) LEO satellites to provide broadband services.

But they are talking of a time frame of beyond the year 2000. But that
is another century.

Why Not Geostationary Satellites?

The answer requires a bit of techspeak. Because, the LEOs and MEOs, as
such, are a breakthrough in satellite technology. They are not an
upgradation of the geostationary satellites. They are altogether a
different technology, belonging to a newer generation. To talk of mobile
satellite systems, without talking technology, is a mistake, to use a
mild word.

First, what necessitated the change ...

There is something called the Clarke Orbit (some also call it the Clarke
Belt). Perhaps, you know about it. For those who do not, it is an orbit
in the space about 35,860 km above the equator where the period of
revolution of an object is roughly 24 hours, the same amount of time
that the earth takes to revolve around itself. A satellite, which is
placed there, can maintain a constant elevation and angle from a
particular point on the earth, always. In other words, it appears
stationary to that particular point. Hence, the name geostationary. All
the geostationary satellites are placed in the Clarke Orbit.

But what is the problem? It is something that we Indians are very
familiar with. Excess population, that is. Clarke Orbit is just one
orbit at a single altitude. Satellites are many. So there can be what is
called "crowding". There is, of course, no possibility of physical
collision or congestion. Because, even a spacing of two degrees is
actually a distance of about 1,300 km in the Clarke Orbit. The problem,
however, is that the antennas on the ground fail to discriminate among
satellites, if they are too close in the sky, for all practical
purposes, two to four degrees. That means, there cannot be more than 180
satellites, even if we assume a two degree space.

LEOs and MEOs, on the other hand, do not have to operate at a fixed
orbit. They can be placed anywhere between altitudes of 400 to 10,000
km. So, we have no orbit constraint. Hence, no crowding. No problems for
antennas on the ground. If tomorrow, there is a need to add new
satellites, or to launch a completely new system, that can be done
without pains.

Another fact that works in favour of LEOs and MEOs is what is called the
inverse square law for signal power. According to this, a signal in
space attenuate in direct proportion to the square of the distance it
travels. The lower the altitude of a satellite orbit, lower is the
required transmitting power for a signal. Of course, there is an
alternative--that of using large antennas. But, that is also not an
attractive proposition. LEOs and MEOs, which are at a lower altitude,
require less power while using smaller antennas.

The LEOs also offer another advantage. There is negligible transmission
delay as the distance travelled by a call using an LEO is several times
lower than the same using a geostationary satellite. This means, for
mobile communications, which is predominantly voice communications, they
are better. The final deciding factor is, of course, cost of satellites
and the cost of launch. LEOs are much cheaper.

Why MSS?

Landline cellular networks do have certain limitations. Most of the
times, you are deprived of a communication link where you need it
most--in villages, rural roads, forests, and such remote locations. It
is uneconomical for any landline cellular operator to cover these
places. Mobile satellite services expand the service territory to cover
the entire world. "It is like having base stations in the sky," explains
Ming Louie, vice-president, Globalstar.

Put simply, MSSes are LEO and MEO satellite constellations that will
provide mobile voice and data communication facilities the world over.
Since an LEO or an MEO can cover much less geographical area than a
geostationary satellite, usually more satellites are used to provide
global connectivity. MSS satellites will be revolving around the entire
earth, which means any point on the earth will be covered by at least
one satellite. The advantage is that low altitude, high altitude areas,
as well as the seas will now be the coverage area of telecommunications.

MSS service will provide a cost-effective way for extending the reach of
basic telecom operators. Laying cables and even microwave links to
remote low subscriber locations is not only costlier, but also time
consuming. MSS connectivity is instant. It is connectivity on demand.

This connectivity-on-demand is beneficial even to the cellular
operators. By collaborating with an MSS operator, they can effectively
tackle the occasional demand in certain locations. Examples include
tourist and pilgrimage spots. Haridwar will have at least hundred times
more demand during Kumbh Mela than that during normal days. So will be
Puri during Rath Yatra. No cellular operator will be able to meet that
kind of differentials in demand. That is not a problem for satellites.
And, of course, they will get a ready back-up network, thus reducing
dropped calls and enhancing service quality.

It is like having base stations in the sky

Residents of rural and unserved areas will gain access to a telephone
courtesy MSS services. DoT has this ambitious plan of covering all the
villages in next three years. Estimates show, the cost involved will be
enormous as the task is almost impossible. Enter MSS and the village
public phones will be there, as and when required.

The last segment of users--the most important from the MSS operators'
point of view--are the international business travellers, the creamy
layer. With globalization, the population of this tribe has gone up
considerably. For cellular operators, using MSS services for serving
them is a better option than using roaming with other operators because
the complexities of revenue sharing can be much less in the former.

Iridium Vs Globalstar

But why only Iridium and Globalstar?

On 31 January 1995, FCC in the US allowed three of the five
applicants--Iridium, led by Motorola Inc.; Globalstar LP, promoted by
Loral and Qualcomm; and Odyssey by TRW while deferring two
others--Mobile Communication Holding's Ellipso and Constellation Com
munications' Constellation. In addition to this, there is an
international consortium, Inmarsat's ICO. So we have four projects that
are rolling on at present.

The reasons behind talking about Iridium and Globalstar are primarily,
two. They will become operational at least six months before any other
such project. Two, we are interested in India more than we are in FCC
licences or the meetings of corporate bigwigs in Los Angeles. And
Iridium and Globalstar have been most active in India (more about that
latter).

The fact that both these projects are LEO satellite-based is merely
incidental.

Iridium is pioneering. The idea of using LEOs for MSS first came to
scientists at Motorola's satellite communication division in Chandler,
Arizona. Motorola was also the first to approach the FCC for licensing
Iridium. Globalstar came latter, but now is giving good competition to
Iridium.

Iridium provides total coverage. Iridium with 66 satellites provides
total global coverage, whereas Globalstar covers only 70 degree S to 70
degree N. It excludes the poles from its coverage area.

Globalstar has low system cost. Globalstar has managed to keep its total
system cost low by using less number of satellites. Globalstar's total
system cost is $1.8 billion as compared to Iridium's $3.4 billion.
Funding, hence, won't be a problem for Globalstar.

Tariff: Globalstar wins outright. Globalstar, because of its lower
system cost, plans to provide the service at a tariff of 30 cents per
minute which is several times lower than Iridium's tariff of $3 per
minute. The Gobalstar price will be slightly higher (about 50 cents)
when it reaches the customer as the local partner will also have his
share.

Iridium uses 66 LEO satellites at an altitude of 780 km, with
intersatellite links. Irdium offers total global coverage

Prime targets are different. Though business travellers are the target
for both Iridium and Globalstar, the latter puts emphasis on developing
nations as well. This is understandable as the tariff of Globalstar can
be afforded in these countries. This is something that Iridium needs to
really worry about. The international business travellers will also need
high-speed data communication. Teledesic may also target this elite
market. As of today, the Teledesic plan is for fixed services. But with
840 satellites, mobility can be added to system with marginal
incremental cost. That will create problems for Iridium. Iridium should
either plan for broadband to directly compete with Teledesic or could
build up a loyal user base for paging. Or try both. There is no fourth
way. Perhaps, it will do that once it makes some quick revenues.

Iridium, despite large system cost, will break-even fast. Motorola,
because of its brand equity, will attract major business users. And
these are the people who will use the system more. Iridium, hence will
make much better revenue, even if Globalstar gives it a run for its
money as far as number of subscribers is concerned. That means Iridium
can plan for next phase better.

Globalstar uses technology better. Though better technology usage does
not necessarily mean better revenue, it helps. Globalstar does not use
complex inter-satellite links and keeps the entire intelligence on
ground. This will be the trend of tomorrow as this helps one to have
better control on the system.

Globalstar uses CDMA technology. CDMA is proving its superiority in
terrestrial cellular and PCS. In satellite communication, it is even
better. TDMA, being used by Iridium, requires exclusive command of the
spectrum while offering less capacity. No wonder, almost all the MSS
service hopefuls, with the exception of Iridium, are planning to use
CDMA. Iridium was finalized when CDMA was still in labs.

The Indian Scene

India is never the same as the rest of the world. MSS services are no
exception. While the rest of the world is thinking of LEOs and MEOs,
India has provisionally approved an MSS proposal using a geostationary
satellite. And, it is the only MSS proposal approved so far.

The $850 million project by Afro-Asian Satellite Communication (ASC), a
Gibralatar-based company, owned by Zee TV owner Subhash Chandra, plans
to use a geostationary satellite to cover India and 53 other countries
in the region which come under the satellite's footprint. It plans to
launch the satellite in third quarter of 1998 and start the service soon
afterwards. While transmission delay and large power requirements make
present generation geostationary satellites unsuitable for mobile
communication, a technology breakthrough may well be able to do that. A
Price Waterhouse forecast says that mobile communication with hand-held
units will become commercially available by the year 2000. Chandra plans
to do that at least a year earlier.

Inmarsat, through VSNL, has also publicized its plan to start the ICO
service by 1999. VSNL will be the local partner in services in this
project which will spend $37 million for equipment in the first phase.

But VSNL is yet to start promotional activities for ICO.

Globalstar uses 48 LEO satellites at an altitude of 1,390 km. All the
intelligence in the system is kept on the ground. There is no
intersatellite link.

In contrast, Iridium started selling the concept in mid-1995. Indian FIs
have contributed as much as $38 million to the project. That is 5
percent equity. Iridium India Telecom Pvt Ltd, as the investing company
is called, has contributions from various Indian FIs through IL & FS.
Others are IDBI, Exim Bank of India, SBI, ICICI, HDFC, GIC, LIC, and
UTI, among others.

What will help Iridium is that these FIs will use their clout to make
the venture successful. Motorola's brand equity will also help.

Globalstar, though it came much latter, has already opened up an Indian
joint venture. The company will have 51 percent share held jointly by
Crompton Greaves and Pertech Computers Ltd while the rest 49 percent
will be owned by Hyundai-led Hyundai/Dacom. Hyundai holds the Globalstar
service rights for this region. Globalstar plans to invest Rs 4,300
crore in India during the next few years. Globalstar's partners could be
the cellular service providers. Last August, Globalstar organized a
technical forum in the capital and it was one of the most well attended
forums in recent months. At least, two cellular operators are having
serious talks with Globalstar India and are waiting for government
approvals. Globalstar's strategy of co-operating with local operators
and the low tariff may give it an upper hand. But FIs still have a hold
in the industry and they have invested heavily in Iridium. That could be
a hurdle for Globalstar.

As far as Odyssey is concerned, this writer is not aware of any
activities of the company in India.

Unto The Future

A Price Waterhouse forecast says Odyssey will form a joint venture with
one of the other three consortia and additional joint ventures and
partnerships will be formed by all of the LEO groups. That is true. The
market is big. But never so big to embrace all those who rush in.
The real thing to watch is Teledesic's entry. Bill Gates has never done
anything that is not helpful to growth of personal computers in one way
or the other. Teledesic could be his latest way of ensuring his
objective. With 840 LEO satellites, it could change the whole balance of
the MSS market. And the rules of the game. But the big question: will he
finally go for M, mobility that is? The answer to that question can
determine what MSS scenario will be in the year 2010. That could be a
different story altogether. Watch this space.

MSS: For Whom?

Telecom operators seeking low-cost service expansion to remote areas
Cellular operators seeking low-cost service expansion to low-subscriber
areas of only periodic demand

Residents of rural areas seeking basic telephone service
Businesses needing cellular services globally.

NIIT - THE WINGS ARE MANY

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

In today's world of competition, only the fittest can boast of its
presence, and NIIT clearly marks its way to IT.

There had been many institutions imparting education on IT that are
coming up with high promises of success. The National Institute of
Information Technology, or NIIT as it is popularly known, is the oldest
among them all. A part of HCL Corp., ever since it started in 1981, it
brought a sea-change in the Indian IT education scenario. For the first
time, professional courses apart from medicine or engineering or law
came into being. And for the better.

Going back to 1981, when it came into being, education was the first
motive of this institution. Then it diversified to fields of training,
consultancy, software marketing, and software exports. In 1995, the
scenario changed. With the government's liberalization policy coming in
the air, the need for going global arose. And the international division
was set up.

Apart from these, software export factories were set up aimed at
providing entire software solutions to its clients that includes setting
up of the network too.

Today, NIIT is virtually into every aspect of IT. And telecom. Many
tie-ups are taking place. NIIT is diversifying and so are the areas of
education in infotech. Be it software solutions, network integration, or
Internet training, it can boast of its expertise in many areas.

The level of expansion is so high that lately the sales training
division of the institution, NIS had to be separated as an entirely
different entity. Now called NIS Sparta, the company has emerged as a
joint venture with Team Productivity, a specialist in imparting training
in sales and marketing. The other four strategic business units include
the Global Education and Training, Global Software Solutions, Global
Software Products, and Multimedia.

In the field of training, it has formed alliances with four companies:
3Com; AT&T Network Systems, now under Lucent Technologies; Microsoft
Corp.; and NETG Applied Learning.

World leaders in computer and communications software are finding India
as the green pasture to venture. And NIIT is the easy solution for them.

For it already has the second largest share in the software market in
India. The organization, already awarded with ISO 9001, international
quality certification, has little to say for its introduction.

The tie-up between NIIT and AT&T has created waves. By recognizing the
area of telecommunications as one of the thrust areas, the alliance aims
at offering training in telecom to the Indians. This includes all,
ranging from the basics to the advanced courses. And NIIT being the
Indian training associate of AT&T completes the process. A programme on
networking education is now being provided with the tie-up with 3Com
under the brand name of Centre for Network Excellence (CNE). Hence, the
total range of education from datacom to telecom is now being made
available.

Companies like Microsoft also has had an understanding with NIIT in
imparting knowledge on Microsoft technologies under the curriculum of
GNIIT programme. For this, it has got the college credit recommendations
from American Council of Education (ACE). NIIT alumnae can seek
exemptions on certain modules in the US universities on the basis of
credits. This programme provides education on Windows NT, Microsoft
BackOffice, Internet products, and Networking. NIIT itself is a major
user of the latest communication tools like videoconferencing, intranet,
and the like.

Apart from these, NIIT is also into varied IT fields like consultancy
and systems integration. In the field of software, it has formed
alliances with major companies which include Sybase Inc., Powersoft
Corp., Ansys Inc., Mentor Graphics, and Mechanical Dynamics.

It has entered into an alliance with Cincom Systems, USA, to provide
enterprise resource application software suite called Control. The main
clients among the communications company using the application are
Alcatel, Ericsson, Hitachi Semiconductor, Siemens, GEC Alsthom, and
Philips. The advanced functionality of Control is insulated with a
3-schema client/server design and is available in multiple platforms
including IBM, DEC, HP, and multiple databases that include Oracle,
Supra, Sybase, and Informix.

Ross Systems Inc. is another US company joining hands with NIIT. This
time, it is to provide the business application software suite of Ross
Systems called Renaissance CS. It is fully integrated open systems based
client/server solution designed from the ground up for process
manufacturing organization like food processing, pharmaceuticals, paper,
and chemicals.

Powersoft Corp., the subsidiary of global software major Sybase, has
tied up with NIIT to provide PowerBuilder 5.0, client/server application
development tool and Optima++ for building Internet applications. NIIT
is the sole distributor of Sybase products in India. Sybase provides
technical solutions to NIIT.

The organization that has been growing the day it had started from seems
to agree with the same old saying that Darwin meant many years ago--
Survival Of The Fittest. On asking the main motive behind NIIT's
presence in telecom education, Sanjiv Kataria, vice-president, corporate
communication, replied, "If we would not have got there, we would have
been dead by now. Today, is the era of Net Centric Computing (NCC) ... And
networking is the key to any business."

VSNL - TO EURO OR NOT

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

To raise funds and fructify its vision, VSNL does need to go the GDR
way.

Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), the Rs 4,417 crore India's
international communications carrier, has been trying to float its
Euro-issue for the past two years now. But its attempts have been
thwarted for one reason or the other.

The ministry of finance is drawing up a list of companies for immediate
disinvestment. The list includes some telecom majors and VSNL could be
one of them. The impact of this disinvestment will be negative if VSNL
has to float its GDR before the end of this year.

Post-disinvestment, the floating stock will increase. This will lead to
dilution of the share price and will ultimately affect the pricing of
VSNL's GDR issue. Further, the chances of getting an attractive price
are also doubtful because of the queue-up of other international telecom
majors. Large number of telecom companies from the US, Europe, and Asia
have firmed up plans for GDR issues totalling over $30 billion.

The first time, VSNL tried to float GDR in May 1994, the share price
fell from Rs 1,550 to Rs 1,200. The issue had to be deferred due to
depressed international equity market conditions and the stiffening of
interest rates. In the second attempt, the share price fell further to
Rs 1,050 and the issue was deferred due to delays in obtaining final
clearances from the government. So goes the VSNL's GDR saga. The
prospects looked even bleak with the impending retirement of BK Syngal,
CMD, VSNL. Even the financial advisor, Anne Morris who had witnessed the
earlier deferrals has also moved out. At the time of this article going
to print, the government has announced another 7 percent disinvestment
of VSNL's equity. And, the Telecom Commission has extended Syngal's
tenure for two more years. A real respite.

Does VSNL really require this GDR? How is VSNL positioned now? Well ...

It is placed in a comfortable position presently. Not because it is the
sole provider of international telecom services, but because it has been
able to build on its own success and vision. It might be a little known
fact that VSNL has the second highest rate of returns on equity--at 38.5
percent, just three points below Advance Info, Thailand.

VSNL has been operating independent of budgetary allocations by
ploughing money back into projects for building, maintaining, and
expanding its services. However, VSNL's profit percentage is quite low
despite being the sole service provider. This is mainly due to the fact
that the company's profit structure is solely determined by what it owes
to DoT. DoT charges each caller Rs 62.50 per minute and VSNL's income
out of this is just between Rs 4 and 7 per minute. Due to this, its
outgoing traffic has remained almost static as compared to the past.

Because, it is cheaper to call India rather than calling from India due
to falling bandwidth costs abroad. Is this an index of growth?
Definitely not.

Luckily, DoT seems to be acquiescing with global trends in telecom
tariffs. Since 1995, it has announced a 25 percent concession on
outgoing calls between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Even for the Internet
services, VSNL doubled up its 250 hours of access per year to 500 hours
per year.

In anticipation of growth in outgoing traffic, VSNL has been
consistently and aggressively expanding its call-carrying capacity. From
2,109 in 1991, it rose to 11,525 in 1995. And the target that VSNL has
set for itself in the next few years is 35,000. During this period, the
paid telephone circuits increased two-and-a-half times.

The target does not seem to the farfetched, because with falling
tariffs, traffic is going to explode. Together with this are emerging
applications like software exports, videoconferencing, and ISDN, to name
a few. Apart from increase in call-carrying capacity, the lines have to
be high-speed lines. Thousands of switches and fibre-optic links need to
be put up to achieve this milestone. And, this cannot be done by
retained cash-flow alone. Therefore, VSNL does need to go the GDR way.

It would be better if VSNL floats its GDR without much further delay. It
will enjoy the status of being the sole service provider for six more
years ... By that time, VSNL should have become a global telco to reckon
with. It needs to reach an enviable position that might even help the
company to get its sole provider status extended.

MADRAS - CELLULAR OR SERVICES

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Better coverage, low call-drop, and roaming? Or interpreter assistance,
information services, and hospital emergency services? The two cellular
operators in Madras have different priorities for offering to the
customer.

Is providing cellular phone service a part of the telecom industry or
the service industry as a whole? This seems to be a major bone of
contention between the two cellular operators providing the service in
the city of the Madras. While one swears that it is undoubtedly a part
of the service segment, the other refutes it vehemently. Caught in this
war of words are Skycell Communications Ltd and RPG Cellular Services
Ltd.

"We are not a telecom industry but a service one. We are all cellular
service providers and should aim at offering more services," says Ramesh
K Narain, Senior Manager, Sales, Skycell Communications. In line with
this thought, Skycell has recently started offering a number of services
such as hospital emergency service, interpreter assistance, wake up call
facility, etc.

Justifying these host of facilities, Narain says, "The subscriber should
get a more complete service from us when he pays a hefty amount and that
is what we offer." In his opinion, people have understood the need for a
cellular phone and their realization should be valued more by offering
such additional services. "This business is no longer concept selling.
People have started to feel the need and are coming to us now," says he.

But RPG Cellular Services, the second service provider operating in
Madras has a different angle to the entire story. Shashi Kumar Kalathil,
general manager, marketing, RPG Cellular Services, dismissing the
service concept, says, "We are undoubtedly in telecom. Value addition in
cellular could only refer to voice-mail and data transfer facilities.
The rest of them whatever they be, are not value-added in classic
parlance."

The company argues that the effectiveness of the service should be
measured more in terms of the capability of the frequency signals and
not in other service packages. RPG's stance is understandable, given
that it does not offer any value-added services. Instead, it has been
harping on its wide network ever since its started operations with 24
base stations. It does claim to have the larger subscriber base of the
two.

"It is the coverage that matters", says Kalathil. Currently, it has a
total of 31 base stations and his company plans to add 10 more in the
event of a spurt in demand. This move, however, will depend on the
traffic, according to Kalathil. In his opinion, the number of base
stations need to be increased only if either the profile of the city
changes with the migration of a section of people or if the need for
greater coverage inside the buildings in a particular area arises.

Skycell is not too far behind on the base station front. It has 22 base
stations in place and plans to add 10 more by the end of October. "With
this and the new services, Skycell will surely garner about 57 percent
of the total market before the end of March 1997," avers Ramesh.

The subscribers in Madras, unmindful of the wordy duel of whether
cellular is a part of service or telecom segment, seem to have responded
to the new concept. They are not unduly excited at the availability of
such varied services though. "All these could be more of a marketing
gimmick of each of the organization," says Rekha, a business executive
working in a multinational firm in Madras. Their one overriding concern
is the high airtime charges. "Whatever it is, all that I am more
concerned with is my phone bill. Hence, I obviously use it with great
prudence," says Hari Krishnan, a cost conscious business man in
possession of a cellular phone for the past six months. "I still do not
give my cell number to everyone I know," says he.

Despite these reservations, the number of cellular subscribers in Madras
has been growing steadily. Though subscriber base has fallen short of
expectations, the numbers are not way behind projections. According to
estimates put out a year ago by the two players, Madras was to have a
subscriber base of 22,000 by the end of September 1996, the first
anniversary of cellular service in the city. Currently it is at
18,264--a 17 percent shortfall. Of the total subscriber base of 18,264
customers, Skycell claims a base of 8,994 and RPG boasts of 9,270
customers (as on 10 September 1996).

The gradual popularity of the service has motivated the operators to
introduce the concept of using cellular phones on a rental basis. "This
is mainly for those people who have a need to use a cellular phone but
are still not ready to buy one," says Kalathil. "Rent-a-Cellular"
concept is a fairly new service introduced just over a month ago and the
success of the concept still remains to be seen.

Whether the operators finally settle their differences or not, the price
conscious market of Madras has shaped up well, as per the business
plans. And this is perhaps the only area where the two operators agree
whole heartedly. "This is because this time the customers were not
budget-sensitive," say both the operators.

MRTP ACT - CAN IT LATCH DOT'S WINGS?

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

DoT has recently been brought under the purview of MRTP Act. The
question is which DoT? The service provider or policy maker?
The National Telecom Policy 1994 signalled a shift from culture of
monopoly to that of competition in telecom services. Competition, if not
fair, is Jungle law. At the same time, protection of consumer interest
is the ultimate objective. MRTP Commission's decision to include DoT
under its purview is, hence, a welcome step.

In July 1996, the two-member bench of the MRTP Commission consisting
Sardar Ali and S Chakravarthy took a historic decision to bring the
government departments rendering "non-sovereign functions or services"
if they are found indulging in restrictive, unfair, or monopolistic
trade practices except for those services which are provided free. That
includes road transportation, Railways, housing, and DoT. While most of
them are merely service providers to the consumers, DoT's case is a bit
different. It has two different functions to perform. That of operating
basic telecom services and framing policies for the entire telecom
service industry.

Does the Commission's observation also include DoT, the policy maker?
That is the point of debate. Since there is only one DoT, and it is not
too willing to separate both the roles in near future, DoT, the operator
should also be accountable for what DoT, the policy maker is doing. And
vice versa.

The Commission stated that collection of a fee for a service provided
renders it possible for the consideration by the Commission. That means
DoT--no distinction between policy maker and operator--which has taken
huge sums as licence fees, is also liable to be prosecuted if it fails
to provide service. Does that mean failure to provide easy and
acceptable interconnect facilities to the private operators can be a
reason to bring the case to MRTP Commission? While some feel this is
stretching the thing a bit too much, there is no less number of why nots
in the response. Some also say that the restrictive nature of the
interconnect agreement can be challenged on the grounds that it has made
the sector unfavourable for private operators and has thus negatively
affected the users. It should be mentioned here that as the tender
document did not stipulate any interconnection charges, there should not
be any interconnection charges. Again, DoT does not pay charges for a
call which originates from its network and goes to private operator's
network. So, DoT should also pay interconnection charges. There should
be a common code for everyone. A few of them even go to the extent of
accusing that the main objective of DoT is to maximize its revenue
irrespective of the impact this may have on the consumers and, of
course, private operators. Says TH Chowdary, director, Centre for
Telecom Management and Studies, "This is an anti-competitive,
monopolistic, and restrictive trade practice."

It is noteworthy that in the recent past, the MRTP Commission has issued
a notice to BPL Mobile, one of the cellular service providers in Mumbai.
This happened as per a consumer complaint filed against the value-added
tariff plan of the company. It is mentioned in the complaint that while
BPL Mobile in its value-added tariff plan claims to charge the consumer
Rs 4.25 per minute for every call till the consumer logs up 800 minutes
a month. But, as per the complaint, the company is collecting Rs 5 and
not Rs 4.25, even before the consumer logs up 800 minutes in a month.
This is because the company, in effect, collects Rs 4,000 as advance
charges for calls.

After the new telecom policy was announced in 1994, Indian telecom
scenario has undergone a sea change. During this period, it has gone
through many ups and downs. It has also witnessed many controversies
like not allowing the PSUs to participate in the bidding, capping on
licensing, telecom scam, and change in partnerships. Are not these
enough for MRTP Commission to be a bit stricter in implementing its
regulations on DoT?

DoT has been adopting a policy of inconsistency. Time to time, it has
changed some of its policies. Either by revising or by withdrawing.
It is a matter of fact that since the privatization of telecom sector,
DoT has been adopting a policy of inconsistency. Time to time, it has
changed some of its policies. Either by revising or by withdrawing.
However, this has not affected the growth of the Indian telecom
industry, till date. It is booming. And, one hopes, it will not do so in
the future also. Let us wait and watch.

VSAT MARKET - LOOKING FOR A FASTER TURNAROUND

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

There is an Indian Airlines flight from Varanasi to New Delhi that goes
via Bhubaneswar. If you take the flight from Varanasi for the capital,
you will fly to Bhubaneswar, and then come to New Delhi. It sounds
amusing.

But, many corporates do the same when it comes to sending electronic
mail. To send E-mail from Delhi to Madras they go to Manhattan. There is
a faster turnaround from outside than inside. One can go on and on
giving examples. But the bottomline is, after years of big talk, the
state of our communication services has improved little. Boasting about
introducing new technologies do not help. Exploring their capabilities
do. Fax has seen a tremendous growth. Reason, it was a revolution at the
customer's end. Structured cabling is seeing explosive growth. Reason,
ditto. Wherever DoT has not got involved, it has been a success story.

Can We Continue To Live With That Kind Of Attitude Today?

Today, the environment is getting increasingly competitive. Quality of
products is rising. Products are moving fast on the store shelves. Take
shirts for example. In the last couple of years, one has seen a number
of foreign brands come in. Arrow, La Coste, Ralph Lauven. In the face of
this competition, some Indian brands have survived, others have not. One
does not hear too much about Wings/Four Seasons these days, though
Zodiac has managed to do well. Indian companies can certainly compete
with global brands in quality of products. Especially in certain
segments, textiles being one. But what they do not have is the resources
that large corporates can deploy. Companies like HLL, Proctor & Gamble,
Philips. Communication is one vital tool of doing business these days.

These Indian companies also need faster, reliable communication. They
would certainly use VSATs if they are provided at an affordable cost.
After years of big talk, the state of our communication services has
improved little.

Companies need to be market ready and ready to market. It involves fast
turnaround. The newly set up private banks like IndusInd, TIMES Bank,
Centurian Bank, all have used VSATs to achieve fast turnaround. Fast
turnaround on information of deposits. And fast turnaround on profits.

And the same is the case in manufacturing and distribution. Ashok
Leyland, Bajaj Auto, SAIL, TISCO, and Essar are using this satellite
technology to move their business processes faster.

Sectors that are doing well in the economy are courier companies,
hotels, and airlines. It is a manifestation of the state of economy.

With increasing globalization, a number of joint ventures are getting
formed. And, just as in a marriage, the joint venture is going through
various stages. The first stage is the courting stage, the second is the
engagement, and the third stage is marriage. Most of the companies are
in the first stage and some are in the second. And they need to be able
to communicate with their partners--foreign and Indian alike. So the
sectors that have a role in supporting these activities are naturally
doing well. It is like the marriage season in Indian economy.

Companies like Hindusthan Lever, Proctor & Gamble, and Citi Bank can set
up their own WAN. But, then they are part of an exclusive club. They can
afford it. DoT has been slow in its commitment on customer
service--HVNET was supposed to be up and running a year ago. One is
still waiting. The other service providers are meeting with some
success. But, at an average cost of Rs 8 lakh per VSAT as far as the
TDM/TDMA variety, it is still pretty much meant only for the elite. So,
customers need to wait for prices to come down and services getting
better.

A new twist that has been added is the Sukh Ram impact. The new boss at
Sanchar Bhawan has delinked himself from day to day operations. But,
what is happening is that in the name of delinking, things are getting
delayed. An example in point. DAMA services have not got off the ground
for any VSAT provider except HFCL and Telstra V-Comm. And the new year
is already six months old.

The Need For Voice

VSATs are already in use. Yet, much more market potential needs to be
tapped. The biggest communication need in the country today is "voice".

The independent gas station owner on the National Highway is not
interested in credit card transactions because he only takes cash,
therefore, has little reason to buy a VSAT terminal. But, if you come
along and you give him a telephone line at a reasonable price and high
quality, he will buy it. There is a larger market opportunity for VSAT
and the market is demanding voice. But, they do not want voice at Rs 8
lakh, they want voice at Rs 50,000 per VSAT. Come to DAMA. At this
pricing policy regime, a DAMA terminal would be costing Rs 15-16 lakh.

Who can afford them such investments?

Today, it is the MNCs and large corporations who can think of using
VSATs. MNCs are used to large pipes connecting their various business
locations. And, in the absence of reliable terrestrial links, they need
to depend on VSATs.

Consider an organization that is Rs 700 crore dealing with high
technology products and services. The total communication costs are of
the order of Rs 3.75-4 crore. The two most important markets for this
organization are the west and south. As a result, 70 percent of the
organization's communication costs are between Mumbai and Bangalore.

That is out of the total communication costs incurred in Mumbai, i.e. of
the order Rs 1.25 crore, Rs 75 lakh are for communication between Mumbai
and Bangalore.

The rule of sercive provision is that the more the network is loaded,
the more money you make. DoT is in a commanding position and is not
about to lose its marketing share.

Let us now look at a scenario where the organization has a dedicated
leased line between Mumbai and Bangalore. The cost of the leased line
(with both fixed and recurring costs) is of the order 14 lakh. Let us
add an additional cost of 10 lakh to the downtime. So the total expenses
would be Rs 24 lakh. Compare that to Rs 75 lakh. That is a saving of 50
lakh.

Today, DoT has got 15,000 leased lines installed country-wide. And, the
concentration is in the metros. But, the issue is leased lines in
centres outside the metros. That is where VSATs can filled the gap.
Also, in its present form access to the PSTN does not exist.

The rule of service provision is that the more the network is loaded,
the more money you make. DoT is in a commanding position and is not
about to lose its marketing share. The more private networks--whether
VSATs or not access DoT's network, the more revenue DoT earns.

Even from the customer's point of view, he is not interested in some
esoteric technology, but rather in getting a phone line on demand. If
VSAT policy remains in the present form, then the real addressable
market is only for the large organizations. However, the access of VSAT
equipment to PSTN will open up a whole new market medium and smaller
companies and even individuals. And, that is the real India.

WILL THE POTENTIAL BE REALIZED?

The answers depend not on technology, but on a variety of other factors:

1. Pricing Policy

Will new services be offered at prices which attract widespread use?
Will new tariffs be extended to maximize revenues from large users or
subsidize the costs of other services?

2. Ownership Of Facilities

Will users such as broadcasters be able to own their own
satellite--receive terminals (downlinks) and transmit stations
(uplinks)? Or will they continue to be required to lease them from DoT
that will recover several times their cost in large charges?

3. Terrestrial Facilities

Will resources be allocated to solve the last mile problem, i.e. to
install local loops or radio links, rebroadcast transmitters, and so on?

4. Competition Or Exclusion

Will the established communication networks take advantage of the
technology to lower the costs and reach new customers? Will they pass on
these savings to their customers or absorb them as additional profit?
Will they attempt to block the entry of new networks designed to reach
unserved customers, or to reach existing users at lower cost?

5. Role Of Government

Will government policies be flexible enough to facilitate maximum use of
the technology. For example, the adoption of policies to minimize user
costs and to encourage new entrants to supply both equipment and
services.

6. Flexibility And Innovativeness

Will organizations that could apply satellite technology to better serve
their customers be flexible and innovative enough to adopt it?

VSAT MARKET - BAMBOO OR BONSAI

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

The most important innovation in satellite technology in the Eighties
was Very Small Aperture Terminal or VSAT. Initially, VSATs were designed
for inexpensive low volume data transmission. Today, versions have been
developed that transmit higher volumes of voice, data, and video. India
has an opportunity to leapfrog its underdeveloped communication
infrastructure with rapid VSAT deployment. And thereby pursue strong
economic growth.VSAT technology promises a wealth of new services.

Combined with advances in low cost earth station design, bandwidth
compression techniques to facilitate transmission of motion video, and
new techniques for low cost voice and data communication. And, most
importantly, social and economic benefits for society as a whole.The
market has not taken off as fast as one would have expected. We have a
window of opportunity with this technology. But, will the promise be
fulfilled? The answer depends not on technology, but on a variety of
other factors, chief among them being policy.

A Market Still To Be Born

It is still a big boy's game. At their current price, only the large
corporate users can afford VSATs. In a country that is so large and
where communication infrastructure is concentrated by and large in the
metros, one would believe that there would be a huge potential for this
technology. Its diffusion has not been as rapid as one would have
expected.

We at Voice & Data, in August 1995, had predicted a market potential of
Rs 200 crore in 1995-96. We ended up realizing only about Rs 100 crore.
The problem, however, has not been demand, but access to that demand.
And, one will need to look at flexible solutions in order to achieve
that.

In the growth of this market, the gatekeeper plays a key role. It is not
just a simple equation between demand and supply. But, one of regulating
the whole process. And DoT, as the gatekeeper, has played an inhibiting
role so far.

The tariff structure still does not reflect the advantages of this new
technology--cost independence of distance; point to multipoint
distribution; economical uses of satellite bandwidth. The structure is
still reflective of an attempt to maximize revenues from large users.
And the non-commercial attitude of DoT. It certainly, today, is not seen
as a tool to promote the development of an economy.

VSATs and terrestrial links go hand-in-hand. And, like terrestrial
links, VSATs are pipes. Ones that allow information to flow back and
forth. DoT is the provider of terrestrial links. And with demand
outstripping supply, one would have thought that DoT would encourage
deployment of these "pipes in the sky". In the growth of this market,
the gatekeeper plays a key role. It is not just a simple equation
between demand and supply. But, one of regulating the whole process. And
DoT, as the gatekeeper, has played an inhibiting role so far.

But, DoT is playing its old games. It is a monopoly and it is acting
like one. The satellite carrier cannot market directly to the end user,
but only to DoT. The equipment supplier can try and reach end users as
well as DoT, but the power to take decisions on adoption of technology
rests with DoT. Evidence of users demand can take the form of waiting
lists. In order to help meet that demand, some technology providers
could also conduct "pilot projects". But, if DoT decides not to respond
to this demand, the user has nowhere else to turn.

Contrast this with the diffusion of computers. Diffusion of this
technology does not rely on a single gatekeeper. There may be multiple
channels--wholesalers or retailers. The government may intervene to
control supply, however, by limiting imports and/or encouraging local
production of technology as a developmental strategy. Users are able to
influence supply and price through their activities in the market-place.

VSAT technology is attractive to the user because the service provider
can guarantee high quality and fixed user cost. However, the cost of
acquisition is high. As far as the customer is concerned, DoT blocks
access to equipment and services they need. And may be ready to pay for.

Corporates here can neither set up their own systems to bypass the
unreliable telephone system nor obtain high-quality services from the
telecommunication authorities. So the customer has no choice.

Why is DoT making things difficult for VSAT?

One possible reason could be that it sees VSATs as competing with
its terrestrial infrastructure.

That is why VSATs are not allowed to be connected to the public switched
telephone network. And VSAT service providers are only allowed to
connect in closed user groups. The market has huge potential. But, like
a bamboo, it needs to grow in an open and free environment.

VSATs are not necessarily a standalone technology. It is not a direct
competition for the terrestrial link. In a country where the telephone
density is 1.2 telephones per 100 people and business centres are so
widely spread, VSATs could act as a strong complementary technology.

The average trust in telecommunication service provision is rather low.

And in important matters the traditional methods (personal meeting,
signed papers, etc.) are preferred. To try to change this attitude, a
rapid solution for urgent customer needs is provided by wireless
technologies .... VSATs. DoT needs to implement HVNET fast.

The market has huge potential. But, like a bamboo, it needs to grow in
an open and free environment. People trying to play GOD will end in
creating not the real thing, but a small invitation.

STRUCTURED CABLING - DISTRIBUTION WILL DECIDE

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Networking is the next wave and companies are trying to adapt to it.
Structured cabling provides one of the basic entry points for vendors
into customer accounts.

But, today, the focus of competition has shifted from products to
services. Providing services in networking. As a result, managers have
become increasingly concerned about the services their distributors
provide. Ideally, every participant in the distribution channel should
provide the same high-quality services to every customer.

But what are the distribution channels for structured cabling? And how
are managers of these channels looking to provide the same high-quality
services to each and every customer?

THERE are two distinct type of channels. And, they are classified by the
kind of customers that they cater to. The first kind is the
enterprise-wide customers. They are the ones who want turnkey networking
projects executed. And, they are represented by the Top 200 companies in
the country. The second kind is workgroup customers. People whose
networking product and services requirements are of a smaller magnitude.

They constitute the mass market.

WHILE every participant in the distribution channel should provide the
same high-quality services to every customer, in practice, of course,
such consistency is virtually impossible because neither the
manufacturer nor the distributor is likely to excel at everything.

Instead, companies tend to do an outstanding job with some services and
a mediocre job with others.

To overcome these discrepancies, managers commonly try to achieve the
impossible goal of making every channel member equally skilled in every
service. Often this effort entails forcing distributors to hire
additional service personnel or sponsoring training programmes for
distributors.

Innovative managers are trying a different approach. Recognizing that
the proficiencies of some channel members can be used to bolster those
of others, they are experimenting with what we call capabilities-sharing
agreements. Through such agreements, the superior service of one channel
member is substituted for the inferior service of another. Each channel
member offers a greater number of high-quality services at far lower
costs than it could by acting alone. And each contributing distributor
receives appropriate compensation when it shares its superior
capability.

This is the idea, implementation, though, could be tricky. Let us looks
at the national netas. The HCLs, the Wipros, and the like. Today, the
networking products market is of the order of Rs 300 crore. It is
expected to touch Rs 1,200 crore by 1998-99. Four times growth in three
years. And, everyone would be looking to address this market. Now this
market can be segmented into two distinct streams--the enterprise-wide
market and the workgroup market. Opportunities exist in both the
markets. The turnkey solutions market is of the order of Rs 450 crore
and workgroup segment another Rs 750 crore. But how can these
opportunities be addressed by the players?

THIS opportunity is huge and now is the time companies need to be
positioning. For action delayed could be market denied. In order to
highlight the way the market is evolving, we have built up a model.

Consider the given chart. The X axis represents volume, while the Y axis
represents value. Volume means amount of business in structured cabling.
The key driver for this axis is money. The Y axis corresponds to value
add. Higher one goes on the Y axis, higher the value add. The driver of
this axis is intellectual resources.

The way a company decides to deploy its resources to distribute
structured cabling could get it to be classified into different
quadrants.

THE first quadrant has two distinct clusters ... Cluster I has HCL
Comnet, Wipro, Digital, and TISL. These companies are the big names and
traditional rivals. The biggies would want to address the entire market.
But to address those turnkey projects, they will need to form alliances.
Let us take an example. Wipro has bagged an order from BPCL for a
turnkey project. It will be the one point source for the entire project.
However, it has contracted Comptel for doing the structured cabling.

That is Comptel's strength. And, this partnership is not only for this
particular project, but rather on a more continuous basis. Same is the
case with HCL Comnet which as been developing its own cabling partners.
The company has met with a great deal of success in bagging campus-wide
network projects. Cable laying requires a great deal of customization.
And for this specialized job, you need to call in professionals. Digital
is going to gain from growth in the manufacturing sector. TISL has some
key accounts which it should be able to leverage on.

Cluster II has players like MicroLand, Datacraft-RPG, and PCL. CMS is
the one to watch as it has been gaining ground rapidly. These people
will bag, on an average, less revenue from structured cabling in the
enterprise-wide cases than the biggies.

MicroLand has a strong presence in the corporate segment, Datacraft-RPG
is making inroads through its network integration focus. PCL is another
player in this league with strong public sector and government accounts.
CMS is beginning to make an impact. It got shortlisted in the Reliance
deal with HCL, Wipro, and Digital.

The long-term success of turnkey/enterprise-wide solution providers will
depend on how well they are able to partner with other smaller players.

The big guys have bagged these corporate accounts after aggressive
selling and close customer contact. It is now going to be difficult for
them to give up control to their partners. Comptel is doing
sub-contracting work on cabling with Wipro, but in time would be getting
big enough to pitch for certain contracts on its own. In any case, the
smaller partners shall be increasing their influence in the active
components of the networking game while the biggies would want them to
concentrate on the passive components only. This is because structured
cabling is not where these biggies make money, with increasing
competition, margins are certainly getting squeezed. They carry cable in
order to provide a one stop shop to the customer; margins are higher in
doing higher value add, network design, and integration.

IF you look at the second quadrant, here are companies that are playing
the high volume game. Advantec, Apcom, and MicroLand/Microsell. That is
the present state. There is an opportunity for both HCL Comnet and Wipro
to get into the distribution game. This is because they have large reach
nation-wide and also partners who would be looking to source structured
cabling from them. And, they seem to be preparing to get into it.

Advantec has certainly been very successful. It was a pioneer of sorts
and is modeling itself on Anixter. Anixter is one of the most successful
distribution chains world-wide.

In the distribution game, it is reach and level of support that is
provided to the customers which set distributors apart. This high-volume
game is going to be addressing the large workgroup market. Also, a
number of structured cabling vendors would be depending on these
distributors to get their brand visibility and marketshare. AT&T, today,
has alliances with most of the key guys in the game, Advantec,
Microsell, and Wipro. Apcom is another leader in the distribution game.

It is helping Nortel gain market share. HCL Comnet is the one to watch.
It is working in an exclusive relationship with Siemon. It will be
interesting to see how it builds up the Siemon brand against Lucent.

Another cluster that is emerging in the same quadrant has companies like
IT&T, BNA, and C-Tel. These are companies that have signed distribution
agreements with AMP, BICC, and IBM, respectively. IT&T is a medium-sized
networking company, focusing mainly on markets in the North and West.

BNA is a strong technology company that has focused on cabling right
from the start. It is based out of Bangalore. C-Tel is a company that
also has a strong technology orientation. It has been looking at the
networking market from the high value-add side--things like network
design and integration. The market is growing rapidly and all these
companies have an opportunity to penetrate the market. How successful
they are, depends on their choice of target segments and reach.

The way a company decides to deploy its resources to distribute
structured cabling could get it to be classified into different
quadrants.

THE third quadrant has companies that are the workhouses ... the actual
implementors. Companies like Proactive Data Systems, Comptel, BNA,
Optel, Gateway Systems, Delta Force, Taker Technologies, Advanced Micro
Devices, and Infotech. They are the guys who get their hands dirty.

Companies here are relatively new and small. And have very different
backgrounds. Proactive Data Systems has evolved from a background of
vending networking products and services. Taker Technologies has history
of providing EPABX Systems. Optel and Gateway Systems are dealing with
fibre optic cable. This is a specialized area. Optel is partnering with
HCL Comnet on campus wide projects.

Gateway Systems is more focused in the West--addressing large corporate
customers like Bajaj Auto and Telco. So, the backgrounds here are both
voice and data. And, there are some who have always focused only on
cables, like BNA. One will see increasing number of players as this is
one entry point into the market. But then companies here will start
moving into other quadrants. Like, Proactive which is trying to move up
with higher value add and BNA that is looking at the mass market.

THE fourth quadrant is the sector where one is seeing the largest chunk
of hidden champions move in. Companies like Ramco, Zenith, Unicorp,
Melstar, DCM DataSystems, IT&T, and Samtech. These are companies who are
targeting the workgroup market. They are realizing that structured
cabling is a key point of entry into the customer's backyard. They are
realizing that they need to have influence on as many networking
products as possible. So, they are extending their focus from boxes to
the core of the network infrastructure; and, provide a total network
solution to the customer.

Ramco, for example, has been one of the biggest channels for Bay's hub
sales in the country. Realizing the strong correlation between hubs and
structured cabling, it is now focusing on cabling as well. And, as it is
targeting largely workgroups, it is a typical IV quadrant player.
Another interesting company here is DCM DataSystems. It is focusing on
the networking products and services market, more importantly, the
government and public sector organizations, the typical tender market.
And, it has tied up with AMP, a recognized structured cabling brand from
the US.

These are one kind of players here. Another are companies who are
targeting newer opportunities in structured cabling itself. Structured
cabling involves UTP and fibre. Laying fibre is still a specialized job.
And, a whole lot of opportunities are emerging in manufacturing and
telecommunication sectors to deploy fibre. Here companies like Optel,
Gateway Systems, and Proactive Data Systems are trying to position
themselves.

STRUCTURED CABLING - INTERVIEW WITH AJAY ADVANI, DIRECTOR, LUCENT
TECHNOLOGIES

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Ajay Advani, director, Lucent Technologies and former director,
Advantec, is one man who has had the inside track of the structured
cabling in India right from its inception. Interview with him follows.

Structured cabling was a new concept here in 1992. What was your
experience in this early phase?

Things were hard. In those days, I remember making customer calls and
getting insulted. "Haven't heard of your company and if this technology
is as great as you claim, then with a brand like AT&T to back it, it
does not need selling. And if we want this thing, we will speak to AT&T
directly."

What was the focus then?

One thing was getting to be clear. Customers are apprehensive of new
technology. They are looking for change, a better change. But they are
not sure whether this vendor is the right vendor or not. I tried to make
the customers comfortable. To reassure them that there is no catch. But
I needed reference sites.

When did that happen?

My first reference site came to me in February 1993, over six months
after I had been in the field. It was a Wipro customer, a paint company
in Mumbai, to whom the company had sold 11-12 nodes. That was the first
time I saw this technology work in India.

Who were your first major customers?

Banks. MNC banks were my first major customers. Citibank, Chase
Manhattan, Standard Chartered.

How do you see the technology evolving?

Technology is heading towards faster and faster data transmission
speeds. Voice and data was integrated early. Video was a bit of a
problem, but that has now been taken care of. Today, you have buildings
with structured cabling systems that support outlets for phone, PC, TV,
VCR, smoke detector, and fire alarm.

Are you referring to intelligent buildings? Don't you think it is a
little futuristic today?

The concept of intelligent building is more with respect to the mindset
of the builder. Structured cabling helps add value to properties. Cost
of real estate is rising rapidly--at least in the metros. While property
rates have grown 200 percent in the last two years in Mumbai, builders
are looking to provide value to properties. Along with marble on the
floor, granite in the kitchen, and phone with voice mail and other
features, they are planning to provide shafts for structured cabling.

STRUCTURED CABLING - THE MAGIC MARKET

from VOICE AND DATA (India), Vol 3, Issue 4, October 1996

Having good quality cabling infrastructure is very important as over 70
percent of the network problems are cabling-related, and the cost of
downtime can exceed original costs.

However, in our interactions with corporate users and industry, we came
across some interesting trends. One is that both the supply side and
demand side are driving the cabling market. Also, size of market
opportunity is getting major network integrators to look at this market
from more than one viewpoint.

The supply side of the equation shows entry of a number of new
international vendors. Demand is getting fuelled from not only the
existing markets, but the new markets as well.

We are presenting the method in the madness--of how we see things unfold
and on what is hot in today's technology.

The most important trend in networking today is "growing demand".
Corporates are reporting an increase of 20 percent to 70 percent per
year in the number of nodes they are adding to their networks. And what
does networking entail? It enables resource-sharing. In other words,
connecting resources together. And to connect, one needs cable.

"Structured cable", in today's context.

But why so much hoopla about structured cabling? The great interest in
structured cabling is because it provides convenience. The drivers for
cabling today are the need for resource-sharing, the need to scale-up
office productivity, and an increased emphasis on workgroup
collaboration. And in order to achieve this, every seat in an
organization needs to be network ready. Irrespective of where you are
sitting, you need to be connected.

Every seat in an organization needs to be network ready. Irrespective of
where you are sitting, you need to be connected.

The structured cabling market is seeing strong growth, growing over five
times in two years. From Rs 23 crore in 1994-95 to over Rs 120 crore by
1996-97. Both the supply side and the demand side continue to fuel
growth. There is a great deal of infrastructure that needs to be put in
place in organizations as the economy becomes more service driven and
competitive.

The market is being driven by three distinct forces. First is the
presence of increased number of players. The second is the demand in new
customer segments--geographically and sectorially. And, third is
increased networking industry focus.

THE number of structured cabling vendors has grown three times in the
last six months. Till March 1995, the active players were Lucent
(formerly AT&T), Nortel, and Siemon. Today, we have six more
players--AMP, BICC, Digital, IBM, Molex/Mod-Tap, and Siemens. RAD/RIT
Group is also planning to enter the market.

So far, Lucent is the clear leader having entered the market early with
a strong product offering and its principal channel partners--Advantec
and MicroLand--having done a great job. HCL Comnet has helped Siemon
gain a foothold in this market, while Apcom has consolidated Nortel's
position in the structured cabling market.

Looking at the rapid growth of this market, a number of international
vendors felt that they needed a piece of the action. AMP, a US-based
company, has entered the market through alliances with IT&T and DCM
DataSystems. BICC Brand Rex, a UK-based company and part of one of the
largest cable companies, has forged alliances with BNA Flexinet Systems
and CMC. Digital and IBM, the leading computer vendors and the early
propounders of this technology, also have their own version of
structured cabling systems. Molex is one of the leading connector
companies in the world and has its own manufacturing plant here. It is
distributing its cabling system through Intercom Systems and Eiko
Computers. Siemens is a major player in the European market with its
shielded twisted pair offering. RAD/RIT, an Israeli company, has
alliances with CG Informatics and MRO-Tek.

So far, structured cabling has fund favour in the large cities. Now,
the market is moving out and beyond them. Into industrial towns and
clusters.

FROM the supply side to the demand side. Demand is rising--not only in
existing segments, but in new segments too. One of the earliest
customers was the financial sector--Citibank, ANZ Grindlays, and
Standard Chartered are some prominent names. Citibank, in 1993, was
looking to provide telebanking services to its customers. And, it needed
to get its infrastructure in place. The demand for structured cabling
came in from the telecommunication side. Today, as Citibank looks at
expanding its suite of customer services, both voice and data
applications are getting increasingly deployed.

These and other top-of-the-line organizations in the financial sector
were the first to invest in structured cabling. For them, it was a key
infrastructure requirement. The same was the case with Kentucky Fried
Chicken. It is known for talking "chicken". But even before it ordered
its chickens, it had got its cables in place. And all thought-out and
structured. Same has been the case with Coca Cola, Levi-Strauss, and,
now, Ford. These are large transnational companies who understand the
value of having infrastructure in place to provide services to their
customers. Whether it is cola, cloth, or cars.

Another segment is the high-tech sector--information technology and
communication companies. Companies like Oracle, Novell, Motorola, and
Nortel. Software Technology Parks have also seen large scale deployment
of structured cabling. HCL Consulting, Infosys, and Cadence are examples
of such companies.

The campuses also have contributed to the market. IISc Bangalore, IIT
Kharagpur, IIT Mumbai, IT-BHU, and JNU are examples of networked
campuses.

The big opportunities are emerging in manufacturing. A large number of
steel, automobile, and consumer durable companies are setting up shops.
General Motors and Larsen & Toubro are setting up factories in Baroda.
Ludhiana is emerging as a key centre where a whole lot of structured
cabling is getting deployed. Hero Cycles is one of the major sites. But,
a whole set of new customers are coming up there.

Typically, so far, structured cabling has found favour in the large
cities--Bangalore, Calcutta, Delhi, Madras, and Mumbai. In places like
Coimbatore/Tirupur, Cochin, and Hyderabad in the South, in the
industrial clusters of Lucknow/Kanpur, Bhopal/Indore, and in and around
Ludhiana in the North. The most industrial activity today seems to be
happening along the Vapi belt ... along Mumbai/Surat stretch, and also
in Pune/Nasik in the West.

The Taj Group of Hotels is looking to deploy structured cabling across
its 40 locations country-wide. Here, apart from providing infrastructure
support, structured cabling is also seen to add value to "the
properties".

This is the same concept that a number of builders and architects are
toying with. DLF, Ansals, and Raheja are builders looking at deploying
structured cabling along with a whole suite of other facilities.

Hospitals are another opportunity area. A great deal of voice and data,
and video flows back and forth in a modern hospital.

Another potential opportunity area for structured cabling is emerging in
telecommunications. Cellular service has been operational in the metros
for almost a year now. And, cellular networks are getting to be rolled
out in other states. Escotel has announced start of services in Meerut,
some 70 km from Delhi. These structured cabling products could be
modified to suit some of the needs of these operators. Particularly, in
networks with distributed architectures, data flow can be done through
structured cabling.

THE last (but certainly not the least) driver of the structured cabling
market is the increased networking industry focus. Wipro formed an
alliance with Lucent in July 1996. HCL Comnet, in August 1996, appointed
a general manager to spearhead its indirect channel sales. These events
have a common thread. Wipro was earlier sourcing its structured cabling
requirement from Advantec. Today, it feels that with its reach and
focus, it can get into the distribution game, apart from its focus on
network systems integration. The same is the case with HCL Comnet. These
are large IT groups and their focus has been on high value addition in
the network integration game. But that was true when the cabling market
was only at the high end--the enterprise level whether large campuses or
large corporate accounts. Now, the market is taking on mass market
colours, and the big networking companies--HCL Corp., Wipro, Digital,
TISL, MicroLand, and Datacraft-RPG are getting very interested. And,
when they get interested, the market potential intensifies.

Also, the new entrants into the structured cabling market, AMP, has
formed alliances with IT&T and DCM DataSystems. With IT&T, the alliance
is to act as a distributor and also a network integrator. With DCM
DataSystems, it is for a whole range of networking products. Same is the
case with BNA which is to act as a distributor for BICC. Siemon has an
exclusive relationship with HCL, while Nortel is going with Apcom.

You can also expect a whole host of other networking companies--Ramco,
CMS, Comptel, Unicorp, Samtech, and others--to get interested. After
all, structured cabling is one point of entry into a customers network.
And an increasingly important one.

THE structured cabling technology is in transition. Traditional cabling
was the cause of over half the network's downtime. Structured cabling
provides paths of reliability in information flow in the ever-changing
world of networks. Structured cabling system is a complete
infrastructure. It consists of cables and the connecting hardware as
well as the installation and administration practices required to
provide system reliability and longevity. A structured cabling system is
designed to provide a physical link between every work area in a
building or in a campus, and is installed with little knowledge of the
type of communication equipment being connected to it. It accommodates
all of a building's current communication requirements and provides the
ability to cope with new needs as they arise.

When one thinks of structured cabling systems, one thinks of cabling
connectors, wall plates, work area outlets, test equipment, and patch
panels to support standards based 100 Ohm Category 3, 4, and 5 UTP as
well as 62.5/125 mm fibre optic cabling. Today, "Category 5" has become
the hottest term since UTP. But what are these Cats?

Category 3 cable is intended to be used for voice and data transmission
rates up to 10 Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 16 MHz.

Category 4 is intended to be used for voice and data transmission rates
up to 16 Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 20 MHz. Category 5
is intended to be used for voice and data transmission rates up to 100
Mbps--transmission requirements specified to 100 MHz.

ONE characteristic that will be critical in all future structured
cabling technologies is their relationship to the technology already
installed. The new generation of technology must offer more than mere
investment protection though it must certainly offer that. And, it must
do more than simply integrate the new technology with the existing
infrastructure. Owners will want new technology to evolve in such a way
that it adds value continuously to the infrastructure investment already
made.

And, they will want this happen across the board in systems, in the
products that implement the systems; in the support available; in the
business process involved in buying and installing new systems; and in
the development of applications and services.

The Market Is Mushrooming

There are three forces driving the structured cabling market ...

*1. The increased number of players
*2. Demand in new customer segments
*3. Increased networking industry focus

Year                 Market Size (RS.)

94-95                   23 crore
95-96                Rs 61 crore
96-97                  120 crore*

* Projected

The Cable Companies

Structured Cabling Systems encompass Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP),
fibre optic, screened twisted-pair, and shielded twisted pair. Today, it
is UTP which gets most prominence. And, more importantly, the
high-performance Category 5 cabling.

* AMP

A recent entrant into the Indian market, AMP's Net Connect cabling
system is targeted towards open systems architecture. It has tied up
with IT&T and DCM DataSystems to distribute its cabling products and is
looking for a distributor in the South. It plans to aggressively push
fibre cables.

* BICC Brand Rex

Scotland-based BICC Brand Rex is a merger of one of the largest cable
manufactures, BICC Cables, with Brand Rex Inc. It has an alliance with
the RPG Group, one of the largest Indian business houses. It has
appointed BNA Flexinet Systems and CMC as its distributors and network
integrators.

* Digital

One of the pioneers of the concept of structured cabling. Its cabling
system is application specific. It needs to come out more aggressively
in the market as manufacturing is the big opportunity.

* IBM

Another of the pioneers, who lost its lead to more open systems in
structured cabling. Has entered the market through a tie-up with C-Tel.

TISL, the network integration company, has a large customer base along
with its partners like CMS and Zenith.

* Molex/Mod-Tap

One of the leading connector companies in the world. Has acquired
Mod-Tap and vends the Mod-Tap universal system. Local manufacturing will
be key in the long run and it has got its acts together on that front.

Has distribution arrangements with Intercom Systems.

* Siemens

This German giant has a major presence in Europe. In India, it needs to
get more aggressive. It has a strong product in the shielded twisted
pair segment. That will find a market primarily in the manufacturing
sector, with large number of users.

* Nortel

One of the leading vendors in the North American market, here Apcom has
helped it get a foothold. Apcom is a strong distribution player and has
performed well in the copper-based segment of the market, so far. The
focus has been on banking, software technology parks, and campus wide
networks.

* Lucent

Is the market leader and has a head start in being the first into the
Indian market. It has had major success in top-of-the-line
organizations. The challenge would be to take on the collective might of
the new entrants. Like a leader, it will have to look at newer
opportunities in deploying structured cabling systems.

* Siemon

Has an exclusive relationship with HCL Comnet. It is one of the major
cabling companies and competes well with its competitors and, in some
instances, exceeds them with its regular introduction of new products.

INTERNET, UNIFIED MESSAGING SEEN EMERGING IN 1996

     Converging technologies will change the business of voice
technology this year, analysts told VTSN when we asked what companies
should expect from the voice industry in 1996.
     No one could talk about the coming year without mentioning the
Internet and how it would affect the voice market.  Private branch
exchanges (PBXs) and telephony servers will merge to create
integrated, do-it-all servers on which enterprises will run mission-
critical networks.  The long predicted emergence of unified messaging
and computer telephony integration (CTI) finally will become a reality
in 1996.

The Internet:  CB Radio or New Paradigm

     Even with all the excitement over the Internet in 1995, there
still are many consultants predicting its imminent demise.
     "It's not clear to me that the Internet is not just [citizen's
band] radio," said Dusty Sykes, a consultant for analyst firm Vanguard
Communications Corp. in Morris Plains, N.J.
     But even if it is a passing trend, companies are spending
considerable time, money and resources crafting Internet strategies
and incorporating the Internet into products.
     "The Internet will be very big this year," said Sheila McGee-
Smith, of the PELORUS Group in Raritan, N.J.  "I think people are
spending a lot of time investigating what kind of presence ... [they]
need to have.  I think we are beyond the point of 'do I need a
presence,' [and now should be asking] 'how do I integrate this into
the back office and how do I make money from this.'  Companies need to
know whether there is money to be made or not."   
     The rush to the Internet has not been all rosy, analysts said,
because many other technologies were ignored in 1995 as companies
clamored for more Internet presence.  One example is fax-on-demand.
     "The same money that might have been budgeted for fax-on-demand
has gone into [World Wide] Web pages," said Peter Davidson, president
of Davidson Consulting in Burbank, Calif.    
     After awhile, the people who are putting money into the Internet
are going to realize it only hits one segment of the marketplace and
they are going to go to fax as well.  [Then] the Internet may create
opportunities for fax-on-demand."  
     In the voice market, Internet activities are particularly visible
in call centers.  Big call center companies, such as Aspect
Communications Corp. of San Jose, Calif., and Rockwell of Downers
Grove, Ill., announced they would be adding technology to their
products that allow callers to access customer service representatives
in call centers by clicking a button on a World Wide Web page.  
     Smaller companies, such as San Jose, Calif.-based Edify Corp.,
also announced software that would perform similar tasks through
software-only, open solutions.  
     McGee-Smith expects to see many more Internet-related
announcements from call center companies and "more focusing on call
center vendors' end-user.  People will need to be able to access call
centers from the Internet."
     The call center market also will continue to grow in 1996, McGee-
Smith said.  "I can't imagine anybody saying ... that [the call center
market] is mature.  That is like saying the personal computer (PC)
market is mature--it is constantly changing."

Combining Telephony and Switches on One Server

     What CTI gurus long have been predicting seems set to come true
in 1996--telephony servers that will run both an enterprise's PBX and
computer-telephony over a single network. 
     "The marketplace is going to recognize that the idea of adding
devices to existing PBXs does not make sense and the market will
recognize that a new paradigm is upon us--new telephony switch servers
that integrate voice, data and communications services," said Jim
Burton, president of C-T Link in Boston.
     AltiGen Communications Inc. in Fremont, Calif., is one company
already causing a buzz over its yet unseen "open multimedia platform
that will offer integrated servers," according to new vice president
of marketing, Gary Andresen, formerly a senior consultant for
Dataquest in San Jose, Calif. 
     Andresen was so impressed by AltiGen's forthcoming platform that
he left Dataquest to get on board with a company that would be
offering what he had been saying eventually would be the enterprise
telephony solution, he told VTSN.  Look for upstart AltiGen to
announce its new platform at the Computer Telephony show in Los
Angeles, March 12-14.
     The type of solution companies such as AltiGen will offer is a
"self-contained unit that has fax, integrated messaging, interactive
voice response, and a switching element so that you have telephone
lines coming in from the central office and telephones serving out of
the box to the desktop.  A web server might also be a part of the
communications, and an automated attendant," Burton said.

Unified Messaging Will Take Hold

     The universal in-box and unified messaging platform are two
technologies all of the big messaging companies--voice and electronic-
-have been pursuing fervently.  Analysts say 1996 will be the year
these offerings become reality.
     "I believe that messaging is the 'killer app' that everyone has
been looking for and it has been sitting in front of us for the past
five years," Vanguard analyst Sykes said. 
     With the need for multimedia messaging driving a technology
convergence, players new to the voice market are changing:  software
heavy-hitters Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft Corp., and Novell
Inc..  
     All three have said they will have next generation client-server
messaging systems coming out in the first half of 1996, and all have
announced or demonstrated plans to include universal in-boxes that
will receive electronic, fax and voice messages.  All three also are
crafting Internet strategies that they are incorporating into these
systems. 
     Release 4.0 of Lotus Notes will become available Jan. 10.  Notes
already offers third-party applications that make it a viable
computer-telephony platform, such as San Diego-based Blue Sky
Technologies' Phone Notes.  However, release 4.0 adds functionality to
Notes while making it simpler to manage and lowering the price. 
Analysts expect the differences to increase Notes popularity, despite
predictions that simpler technologies--such as web browsers--would
dethrone Notes as large enterprise's groupware platform of choice.
     Microsoft has said its Exchange server product would be out some
time in the first quarter of 1996, and many companies have put their
messaging plans on hold until they get a chance to look at what the
Redmond, Wash.-based company is going to offer.  With a large
corporate migration to Windows NT, the company's powerful high-end
operating system, many users will want to use a native Microsoft
messaging solution as well.
     Microsoft also has shown a solid commitment to both computer-
telephony and fax in its products.  Its new operating system, Windows
95, included Microsoft's telephony API (TAPI), Microsoft Fax and a
link to Sprint Corp.'s broadcast fax service in its offering (VTSN,
Aug. 8, 1995,).  
     Novell Netware users are waiting for Novell to release Groupwise
XTD, which finally will make Novell's popular groupware offering into
a client-server messaging architecture.  Groupwise XTD will offer
updated calendaring and scheduling, and Gary Rowe, principal of Rowe
Communications in Atlanta, said Groupwise XTD is "probably the
furthest ahead in the universal mailbox arena."

Fax's Role in Unified Messaging

     The universal mailbox is expected to boost fax's messaging role,
making it both easier and more preferable because of the direct
connection and exact image replication fax offers.
     "Fax is an integral part of the universal mailbox," said Maury
Kauffman, managing partner at The Kauffman Group in Cherry Hill, N.J.
     The proof of this, Kauffman said, is Kirkland, Wash.-based
Applied Voice Technologies' purchase of RightFax of Tucson, Ariz., for
$4.2 million in cash and stock last week.  "This is sending a message
to all the other voice- and E-mail companies that if they don't have a
fax [component], they won't be able to compete."
     Analysts say RightFax leads the market in fax servers, followed
by Optus Software in Somerset, N.J.; they expect the local area
network (LAN)-based fax server market to expand rapidly in 1996.  "In
terms of LAN fax itself, we will see growth rates through the roof,"
Kauffman said.  "There are at least a million Novell networks.  Less
than 10 percent have fax servers on them," Kauffman said.
     The rise of Windows NT also will help the LAN-based fax server
market, consultant Davidson said.  "[Last year] has really been a year
of pilot testing NT-based servers.  1996 will be the year when
commercial sales start to happen in a big way.  What you are going to
have is what was a DOS-based industry become, as much or more so, an
NT-based industry," Davidson said. 

Forming Standards To Meet New Needs

     The introduction of computer software companies that adhere to a
different, more competitive business strategy changed the way voice
companies thought about their own strategies last year.  Once a market
of closed and proprietary technology, the voice industry has been
forced by the encroaching computer software industry to open their
platforms.  
     In response to that need, the Enterprise Computer Telephony Forum
(ECTF) seemed to come from nowhere to become a major industry force in
1995, leaving the other voice standards organization--Versit--
scrambling for position in the rapidly changing voice standards arena.
     "The most important is the formation of the ECTF.  They will get
together and see that we have interoperability--even without Microsoft
and Intel.  There isn't a play for Microsoft and Intel in the ECTF
except to follow what's going on and participate," Burton said.  
     "The Versit community has to be asking themselves whether they
are accomplishing what their goals have been."
     Versit is a four-company standards group composed of AT&T Corp.,
Apple Computer Corp., IBM Corp. and Siemens Rolm.  Each of the
founding Versit companies, along with Novell, joined the ECTF in July
1995.
     Versit worked on its own standard of Novell's open telephony
services application programming interface (TSAPI)--Versit TSAPI.  It
also brought out its encyclopedia of computer-telephony standards, the
Versit Encyclopedia, which is available for anyone to download on
Versit's home page at http://www.versit.com.
     One of the ECTF's goals for this year, according to ECTF
President Tom Zenisek, is to make its own work on Versit TSAPI and the
Versit Encyclopedia its second major project.  In 1996, the ECTF will
release its first body of work:  the telephony application objects
(TAO) specification, which it was given to develop by the Single
Computing System Architecture (SCSA) consortium.  
     The ECTF plans to release the specification at the Computer
Telephony show in March, and have a membership technical and marketing
committee meeting immediately afterwards, on March 15, in Los Angeles.

VOICE TECHNOLOGY INTEGRAL TO RETAIL BANKING SERVICES

     Banks are turning increasingly to voice technology among
solutions to providing 24-hour remote retail banking services.  
     "We believe that eventually this will be the preferred method of
interacting with a bank and there will be appropriate revenue
streams," said Henry Mounger, senior vice president of Deposit
Guaranty National Bank in Jackson, Miss.  "Right now it's (an issue
of) market leadership.  We believe we are laying the groundwork for
what the future of banking delivery will look like. ... It is hard in
the early stages to put a benefit to that."

Working with Visa

     Deposit Guaranty, which has almost $6 billion in assets and
serves Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, is working with Visa
Interactive of San Francisco to provide its customers with remote
banking solutions.  In 1988, the bank installed a virtual response
unit (VRU) from InterVoice of Dallas, to handle requests for account
balances.  In November 1994, Deposit Guaranty offered touch-tone bill
payment, and introduced remote banking by personal computer (PC) in
November 1995, Mounger said.  
     This year, Deposit Guaranty also will begin selling customers
PhonePlus screenphones for approximately $200 to $250 a piece. 
Several bank employees have been trying the screenphones since April,
and Deposit Guaranty plans to select 250 customers to test the system
for free for several months.  Customers will pay an undetermined
monthly fee to use the service.
     Mounger admits the bank is not sure which device or method
customers will prefer--one reason Deposit Guaranty has chosen to
provide its customers with several options.
     "There are lots of mixed reviews on screenphones," Mounger said. 
"We don't want to dictate which device wins [and] we ... have to offer
different options."  Visa buys the screenphones from U.S. Order and
Verifone manufactures the phones which include some intelligence so
users can perform a variety of tasks off-line.  "Visa's strategy is to
  ... support their electronic banking platform by making it compatible
with several screenphones," Mounger said.
     On a systems level, Visa Interactive provides software and
outsourcing services for banks that want to offer remote banking
solutions.  Deposit Guaranty uses Visa to outsource its bill payment
services, which approximately 1,800 customers use.  When a customer
calls in to pay bills, Deposit Guaranty's VRU transfers the customer
to Visa's network, which is linked to Deposit Guaranty's database, and
the funds are transferred then from the customer's account to the
payee. 
     Deposit Guaranty also plans to offer services from the Internet,
although the bank is not yet sure what it will do beyond getting a
home page and World Wide Web site.  "We will be relying on a third
party such as Visa Interactive to get us to that level," Mounger said.
     For its part, Visa is working hard to develop its Internet
applications--last summer it allied with San Francisco-based Worlds
Inc. to develop three-dimensional banking and retailing applications
for the Internet. (Deposit Guaranty National Bank, 601/968-4759; Visa
Interactive, 415/432-2753, http://www.visa.com.)    .DEPARTMENT

EDIFY HELPING BUSINESSES BUILD INTERNAL `INTRANET' SOLUTIONS

     Edify Corp.'s agent software for the World Wide Web is making an
impact on both the user and investor community.  Unisys Corp. last
month purchased Electronic Workforce 4.0 to provide a self-service
human resource application to its 36,000 employees worldwide. 
Employees will access this information through the "Intranet," or
internal World Wide Web, that Unisys' human resources department is
building.  Telephone and fax access soon will be added to the system.
     Wall Street also has taken notice of Edify:  Goldman Sachs & Co.,
of New York City, led an investment group that purchased a $7.4
million minority stake in the company.  Among the investors was
Michael Dell, founder and chief executive of Dell Computer Corp.
     The Edify program will give Unisys employees secure and
controlled access to their human resource records, including benefits
and available leave information, through the Intranet.  Electronic
Workforce 4.0 also will work with PeopleSoft's Human Resource
Management System (HRMS) to allow employees to update records either
over the Web or via telephone.   
     Bluebell, Pa.-based Unisys believes it can control human resource
personnel costs by letting employees make their own changes to certain
personal information, according to Lee Stivale, information technology
project director for human resource systems at Unisys.  
     Unisys also wants to use Electronic Workforce to give its
international employees continuous access to each other.  The
Electronic Workforce integrates such devices and communications
methods as telephones, fax and E-mail with the World Wide Web.

OCTEL BEEFS UP MESSAGING SOFTWARE TO UNITE DISPARATE PLATFORMS  

     Milpitas, Calif.-based Octel Communications Corp. released
version 1.1 of its Aria messaging software specifically for Overture
250 and 350 message servers.  It also runs on Aspen, Branch, Maxum and
XC1000 servers.  Octel says customers can migrate to Aria 1.1 without
losing existing data or having to change equipment.  Users can convert
Octel's systems to an Octel Overture 250 or 350 message system using
Aria 1.1.  The software adds back-up and restore features to the Aria
platform and a Global Message Redundancy option that keeps servers up
and running even if one part of the system fails.  The software is
available immediately in the U.S. and in early 1996 in Great Britain
and Ireland.  (Octel, 408/321-2000.)

FCC DISCUSSING LEVYING TAX ON ISPS TO ENSURE UNIVERSAL SERVICE

       The bold Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering
levying a tax on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) because of the
growth of certain technologies, specifically Internet phone software,
that is allowing the Internet to be used in lieu of the phone
companies, bypassing access fees.  The FCC is concerned that by taking
this revenue from local phone companies, phone service for hard-to-
reach rural areas will increase.  A Notice of Proposed Rule Making may
be issued sometime this year, sources said.  The Commission is
considering levying either a flat tax or basing it on an accounting
system that would make ISPs account for all the traffic they send
through the local exchange and then pay a fee based on that traffic. 
ISPs would then choose whether to pass those savings on to users.

NEC RELEASES CTI APPLICATION FOR ITS PBX SYSTEMS

       NEC America Inc., of Irving, Texas, entered the race to provide
computer-telephony integration (CTI) solutions.  NEC announced Desktop
Receptionist, a Windows-based application for both its private branch
exchange (PBX) systems--NEAX 2400 ICS and the NEAX 2000 IVS.  The
software uses Microsoft's Telephony Application Programming Interface
(TAPI) to make, answer and transfer phone calls using a personal
computer instead of a telephone.  The software also can set up
conference calls, send out pages, transfer voice messages and search
directories.  On the administration side, Desktop Receptionist has
password-accessible security and a reporting application that allows
managers to track incoming call activity, call status and call type. 
The application can be used as a primary answering system, automated
receptionist or a backup answering service. (NEC America Inc.,

INTERVOICE GRANTED PATENT FOR `APPLET' ARCHITECTURE

     Dallas-based InterVoice Inc. is using a hot, new idea in the
Internet community to run advanced intelligent networks (AINs).  It's
making "mini-applications" available for its platforms by placing them
on intelligent peripherals (IPs) over AIN architectures.  The result
is a smarter system that makes use more evenly of system resources.  
     InterVoice has been issued U.S. patent number 5,469,500 for its
technology, which distributes an AIN application's intelligence into
subscripts, once called "applets" and now referred to as service
application modules (SAMs).  SAMs run on an IP instead of leaving the
intelligence on a service control point (SCP), which often handles
such tasks as network database management.  
     "A SAM would be something such as voice mail, voice-activated
dialing, single number service, or automated service activation," said
Al Samball, manager of new business development.  "The modules all can
be tied together."  
     This requires the SCP to exert a lower level of control over the
IP, said Mike Polcyn, InterVoice's vice president of business
development and product marketing. 

Taking the Pressure Off

     Transferring some of the network intelligence and tasks to IPs
takes the pressure off SCPs, much like using an Internet applet means
that the user can avoid taking up personal computer memory storing
applications and instead run the program straight off a remote server.
     "An IP is typically performing very primitive functions," said
Polcyn.  "Play a particular message, collect digits, and so on.  When
you get into a complex application like voice-activated dialing that
has a couple of layers of user dialogue, user input or information
access, the overhead on the SCP of dealing with that complexity in a
very large port configuration would be somewhat overwhelming in terms
of processor requirements."  
     "If you were to break that application into pieces that could be
delegated to the IP, it could perform a lot of those functions
autonomously and then return to the SCP the result of that
processing," he added.
     Polcyn said InterVoice would incorporate this technology into its
own products.  He would not disclose whether the company plans to
license the technology to other vendors. 
     InterVoice also announced that it has joined Texas-based Tandem
Computers Inc.'s Tandem Alliance Program.  The program develops
connections between Tandem's platforms and software from allied
vendors to provide integrated solutions for customers.  Initially,
Intervoice said it will offer voice-activated dialing, single-number
follow-me services, an automated assistant, and voice navigation and
voice mail applications.  (InterVoice, 214/454-8834; Tandem, 214/516-
6484.)

DEAN WITTER TO DELIVER MARKET DATA TO BRANCHES
VIA PARENT SEARS ROEBUCK'S TERRESTRIAL NETWORK

  In what may have been a fait accompli, Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. has opted to use the IBM System Network Architecture (SNA)
terrestrial network of parent Sears Roebuck & Co. to deliver
market data and other information to its 350 retail brokerage
branches nationwide.

  The firm last week announced an exclusive, 7-1/2-year, 10,000-
workstation market data contract with Thomson Financial Services
Inc.'s ILX Systems Inc. market data subsidiary. ILX will oust
incumbent quote terminal providers Quotron Systems Inc. and
Automatic Data Processing Inc.

  Dean Witter had enough problems choosing a market data vendor
for its new firmwide branch system without monkeying around with
the networking piece. Dean Witter had been bedeviled by its
earlier attempts to create a homegrown market data system, using
workstations running IBM's OS/2 operating system and --
possibly -- satellite delivery. That quest was eventually
abandoned last fall (Inside Market Data, Nov. 15, 1991). The
firm then opted to look at solutions driven by the market data
vendors, a process that ended with the selection of ILX and
Sears Technology Services (STS), a subsidiary of Sears Roebuck.

  STS sells voice, video and data services internally to other
Sears units, according to Gary Weis, STS senior vice president of
networking and technology. Weis also has management
responsibility for Sears Communications Co., which sells the same
services to non-Sears companies. He says that SCC is "actively
engaged" in discussions with another brokerage firm that would
bring a DWR competitor onto the network.

  As part of its plan, DWR, the brokerage arm of Sears' Dean
Witter Financial Services Group Inc., will expand its use of the
terrestrial facilities provided by STS, operator of one of the
largest SNA networks in the country (see box). The firm already
uses STS for branch applications, and to provide local
concentrators to handle market data provided by Quotron and ADP.

  "We're glad it's over," says Fred Frohne, executive vice
president and director of information services at DWR. "It was
like giving birth."

  Dean Witter's choice of STS isn't surprising, given the
corporate relationship and the fact that STS is an incumbent of
sorts. But Frohne insists the selection was based on
functionality and sound business reasons rather than family ties
alone.

  "The reason we're using STS is because it's got good pricing,
the right kind of uptime, and over the years the network managers
have become very sensitive to the nature of Dean Witter's
business." Other Sears units on the network are Coldwell Banker,
the real-estate brokerage; Allstate Insurance; Discover Card
merchants; and Sears Payment Systems. Non-Sears customers include
Radio Shack, Goodyear and major petroleum companies.

  "The arrangement within Sears is that where it is the prudent
thing to do, Sears will provide the network services," Frohne
says. "That's not something cast in stone if, in fact, there is a
reason to make a business case to do something the network cannot
provide."

  The rollout is already underway with the installation of 12 386
and 486 IBM PS/2 broker workstations at DWR's branch at 2 World
Trade Center in New York. It will continue with "a dozen or 15
additional locations -- the shakedown group" -- that will allow
the firm to identify and deal with installation difficulties
before moving on to the rest of the 350 branches. According to
Frohne, DWR will continue with the full-scale rollout in the
fourth quarter. Sources say the project is scheduled for
completion by the end of 1993.

  The new network contract covers data only. The firm's voice
vendor is Sprint, managed by STS; the hoot 'n' holler vendor is
AT&T, and DWR already has plans to move its shoutdown services
onto the STS network. There are no plans for video near-term,
though STS's T.1 and T.3 backbone has sufficient bandwidth to
handle video, Frohne says.

                        Back at the Branch

  "The big change is that we took market data and will be
broadcasting that through the network," says DWR senior vice
president George Ross. The ILX ticker plant on Fulton Street in
lower Manhattan will be connected directly to the Sears SNA wide
area network. "It will save us money. The bottom line is we could
have packaged that with a quote vendor, but STS is so big they
can deliver the package more cost-effectively than the vendor
can."

  DWR currently employs a mix of Quotron and ADP market data
terminals for account executives on a broadcast-only basis. The
data passes from the vendor's network into regional DWR
concentrators, and from there on to individual branches via the
STS network.

  Until now, DWR brokers have been using the STS SNA network for
applications related to broker-client services rather than market
data. These applications include account information and
servicing, and internal research. Even so, the volume from the
350 branches is enormous. More than a million inquiries per day
arrive via the STS WAN at the Sears data center in Dallas,
according to Frohne, making it one of the largest such IBM-based
data centers in the country. The new agreement with STS will "add
traffic for opening accounts and placing orders for the
branches," Frohne says.

  In the firm's official announcement of the branch system, DWR
promised the introduction of "a broad range of new services for
account executives and clients. These new features will include
portfolio management tools, spreadsheet packages, word
processing, expanded market data, and market and research alerts,
along with many other applications customized for Dean Witter."
Despite this official pronouncement, Frohne says the network as
such "will not play a role in new product development." STS will
not be adding capacity for the new DWR applications, but he says
"they will absorb us within the network."

  The new implementation on the STS network will increase the
speed of access for DWR brokers from a 14.4 kilobit/second
multipoint access, to point-to-point 56 or 64 kilobit/second
access.

            Sears Has Everything -- Except Satellites

  STS has a 100 percent terrestrial T.1 and T.3 backbone for its
nationwide IBM System Network Architecture network. Frohne says
that STS has "the largest single image SNA network out there."
There are some "400,000 logical devices connected to that
network," he says, including PCs, mainframes, minis, printers and
fax machines.

  Ross says redundancy is built into the network. He describes
the network as a "family of T.1s" linked to more than 50 major
nodes throughout the U.S. These nodes, in turn, are serviced by
T.3 circuits linking the major processing centers in Schaumburg,
Ill., Columbus, Ohio, and Dallas. Columbus has 15 large 900-
series IBM mainframes, according to Ross; it is the central site
for Sears' Discover and merchant applications, and is the backup
for Dean Witter. DWR's main processing facility is in Dallas.

  "It's like a universal virtual network," Ross says. "If we lose
any one data center, the users will never know it happened. I am
of the opinion we could lose two of the three and still be all
right."

                        By Land or by Air?

  DWR's relationship with STS goes back to 1984, when the broker
first began to use STS for the firm's branch applications
networking.

  DWR never considered another terrestrial alternative. But the
firm did look closely at end-to-end satellite services provided
by market data vendors, including ADP's Brokerage Information
Systems Group and ILX. Quotron and U.K. market data vendor
Reuters were also considered, as was Hughes Network Systems Inc.,
a vendor of very small aperture terminal (VSAT) networks.

  "We really did look at all of the networking options," says
DWR's Ross. "Satellite is excellent, it works very nicely.... The
bottom line is there were no dollars to be saved by going off the
reservation to a satellite environment. STS developed their
network with Dean Witter first because we were the most sensitive
users to downtime in the world of Sears. If they could make us
clowns happy, then they knew they had a product that can meet the
needs of the rest of Sears."

  DWR explored satellite options through market data vendors,
thereby underlining the importance of a networking strategy for
these players. Ross says Quotron had no satellite option, but "we
addressed totally unbundling all services" -- so this shortcoming
didn't rule out Quotron for the rest of the pie.

  "We went to Hughes directly," he says, "but if we had chosen to
go satellite, it made more sense to go through ADP -- the reason
being we would have had to set up a group to manage that process
rather than leave it in the hands of the vendor." Under an accord
signed last fall, ADP provides some customers with two-way
satellite communications using Hughes' VSAT technology. Ross says
Dean Witter looked at Reuters "casually" -- although Reuters had
proposed a pilot using its Satellite Delivery System 3 (SDS3)
network.

  "We would not look at any terrestrial solution offered by
anybody else," Ross says. "Being very candid, it was not an
option we had. And they [STS] do not offer satellite. Really, it
[satellite vs. terrestrial] is kind of a wash, to be very candid
with you. It's an iffy type advantage. Satellite means antennas,
roof rights on buildings, and there are dollars involved with
that. So it's a wash overall, nationwide."

  "In any given LATA, [Local Access Transport Area], we have
sufficient density to make long-distance and local access less
expensive than using VSAT technology," says Weis. "Because of the
size and density of the network, it is net cheaper."

NEW YORK TELEPHONE SET TO BRING T.1 ISDN
TO WALL STREET USERS AS EARLY AS NEXT MONTH

  New York Telephone is on the verge of receiving approval for a
tariff filed for ISDN Primary Service that would bring T.1 ISDN
capacity to Wall Street for the first time. If the New York State
Public Service Commission approves the filing, the service could
become publicly available as soon as July 24.

  If approved, ISDN Primary Service would join Basic Service as
New York Telephone's two-headed ISDN offering. The Centrex-
equivalent Basic Rate ISDN, which is comprised of two B channels
and one D channel, has been available since April 1991, but has
been almost invisible on Wall Street. Only Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co., and Citibank -- the three
participants in the recently completed New York State ISDN
trials -- have experimented with the technology in any depth.

  These trials have, however, suggested the variety of
applications that ISDN can bring to the desktop. Shearson, the
most ambitious participant in the trial, tested branch training
applications that take advantage of ISDN's capability to deliver
voice and data simultaneously: both the trainer and the student
can look at and make changes to the same screen while they talk
on the telephone at the same time.

  Merrill Lynch experimented with ISDN as a way to more closely
control telecommunications costs. And Citibank implemented an
international video teleconferencing application using the
facilities of Teleport Communications Group's TC Systems unit.

  New York Tel has been hampered by the scarcity of its ISDN
switching technology. According to Jean Altenau, staff director
for ISDN Product Development for NYNEX's Telesector Resources
Group, Basic Service is available only from Central Offices in
Manhattan on West 42nd Street; in White Plains, N.Y.; and in
Garden City, Long Island. Both Basic Service and Primary Service
can carry integrated voice and data over a single ISDN line, and
both flavors eliminate the need for a modem of any kind.

  NYNEX has remained reluctant to announce a more specific ISDN
deployment schedule. "Right now, deployment is limited," Altenau
says. "But we expect additional deployment through 1992 and
1993." Mary Cooke, associate director for NYNEX ISDN Market
Planning, told a recent forum: "As money comes rolling in, we'll
be able to increase our deployment 50-fold."

                  Primary Service: A Definition

  NYNEX's ISDN Primary Service operates at 1.544 megabits/second,
typically broken down into 23 64 kilobits/second B channels for
transmission and one 64 kilobits/second D channel for signaling;
or 24 B channels under the control of a D channel in another
Digital Transport Facility (DTF), defined in the filing as "a 1.5
Mbps facility between a subscriber's premises network interface
and a port." The B channels can carry voice or data, while the D
channel carries the out-of-band signaling necessary to control
its associated B channels.

  The Primary Service's circuit-switched voice provides digitized
speech or voiceband data access for features like Direct Inward
Dialing, Outward Dialing, WATS long-distance service, and 800
services. The service also allows subscribers to utilize the D
channel for signaling to dynamically allocate B channels on a
per-call basis.

  The full 24 channels will be available at what New York Tel
calls the "suitably equipped" CO's DS-1 port termination via
dedicated lines. According to the New York Telephone filing,
subscribers to the Primary Service have the option to use either
"a subset or all of the channels at the port termination or [to]
have multiple ISDN Primary Service ports to connect to multiple
DTF's."

                         The Commitments

  New York Tel will require a minimum service period of 12 months
"subject to the availability of facilities and node software and
hardware"; additional commitments must also be for a minimum of
another 12 months. All subscriber-based equipment must conform to
the published AT&T and Northern Telecom ISDN Primary Service
specifications.

  One caveat in the filing pertains to the controversial
Automatic Number Identification feature plaguing public utility
commissions everywhere. The filing warns: "The subscriber may not
resell, or otherwise provide to third parties any information
obtained through the use of the Calling Line Identification
feature."

  Pricing is complex. On a per-month basis, the cost of a Digital
Transport Facility to the subscriber will be $332.25 for "the
first half-mile or fraction thereof"; and then an additional $300
for each DTF to the same premises. Ports with 23 B channels and
one D channel are priced at an additional $595 per month, and
Interoffice Termination is priced at either $595 (23 B channels
and 1 D channel) or $545 (24 B channels).

  As for interoffice facility charges, rates are based on NYNEX
Superpath 1.5 megabits/second service. There are optional monthly
charges for backup D channels ($50 each); calling line
identification per port ($150); and channel configuration per
trunk group established ($10).

  If subscribers choose a three-year contract, they will save a
few dollars per feature. DTF, for example, would cost $315.65
rather than $332.25. A five-year contract would reduce that same
charge more substantially, to $299 per month. There will be
nonrecurring charges for service establishment ($250); for any
change from NYNEX FLEXPATH to ISDN Primary Rate Service ($225);
and for any changes to service ($200).

  So far no one has intervened -- a sign that perhaps not even
advocacy groups understand the full implications of ISDN service.
Given the lack of ISDN-capable COs, and NYNEX's reluctance to
move more quickly than its customers, it will be up to Wall
Street firms to create a future that includes ISDN capabilities.

MCDONALD COMPLETES ROLLOUT
OF 29-BRANCH VOICE DATA NETWORK

  McDonald & Company Securities Inc. of Cleveland, Ohio, has just
gone live with a final network link to its Jersey City, N.J.,
office, the last of 29 branches to be tied into an integrated
voice-data network. The new network supports some 400 users at
branches in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan.

  The McDonald rollout illustrates why securities firms are
becoming reluctant to turn over their network destiny to market
data vendors, and how easy it can be to underestimate network
management demands. It also underscores the importance of
integrated voice-data networks in driving down firmwide
telecommunications costs.

  At the same time as they were implementing a new networking
strategy, McDonald took the opportunity of swapping out its
quote-terminal system for a new one developed with New York
systems integrator American Real-Time Services Inc. The ARTS
system, which handles branchwide distribution and display of
Reuters' Marketfeed 2000 digital data feed, replaced some 290 ADP
FS One terminals at McDonald and 75 Quotron Q1000 terminals at
Gradison & Co., a firm based in Cincinnati and owned by McDonald.

                          Who's Driving?

  The driving forces behind the switch to integrated service were
both cost and speed. ARTS and McDonald consider the new network
unique because it will carry three types of data simultaneously:
voice (eight kilobits/second); hoot 'n' holler (16
kilobits/second); and market data in the form of news and quotes
(32 kilobits/second). Boris Gettig, vice president of management
information systems at McDonald, says that voice-data integration
has meant savings "on the order of $250,000 per year."

  McDonald was using ADP Brokerage Information Systems Group's
terrestrial data network for back-office purposes. The ADP data
network is based on analog 9.6 kilobit/second data circuits.
McDonald was using half that capacity to receive market data and
half for back-office traffic.

  Using the ADP analog network, a broker in a branch could
connect to a Tandem Computer Corp. processor in Cleveland and
pull up customer accounts, but response time was sluggish: up to
17 seconds for a full screen to be painted on a broker's
terminal. Once a broker hit the carriage return to make his or
her request, the request data was sent to ADP's data center in
Mount Laurel, N.J., for processing; on to McDonald's Tandem in
Cleveland; and then back out to the branch office. The new,
higher-speed network was able to cut response time to an average
of five seconds, with some requests taking only from two to three
seconds.

                           It's a No-No

  "Neither ADP nor Quotron would allow us to stick an arbitrary
protocol on their network," says Gettig. For McDonald's network
link to ADP, the firm had developed a special program running on
the Tandem to convert standard 3270 data into the proprietary
protocol necessary for transmission to the ADP data center in
Mount Laurel. Nonetheless, according to Gettig, "The protocol
conversion was pretty ragged."

  "With our own new network, we have the flexibility of linking a
PC LAN into the WAN if we want to," he says, "but [ADP and
Quotron] wouldn't allow us to. Essentially, their networks are
used for doing quotes, and other securities firms are using the
same lines to get to the same places. They are quote vendors and
not communications vendors. Both Quotron and ADP said we'd have
to encapsulate our protocols within theirs."

  AT&T lost out after the analog hoot 'n' holler network came
under close scrutiny. McDonald was also paying for long-distance
AT&T circuits -- a pair of 9600 baud digital circuits -- for data
delivery to ADP for back-office processing, a system distinct
from the analog voice network.

  The new integrated network configuration will give McDonald "a
lot of things we never had in past," says Joe Perez, a McDonald
vice president and assistant manager for communications, "like
dial backup in case the network goes down. We have total control
of remote loopback testing, and signal gain and loss testing.
Before, we were pretty much at the mercy of AT&T to tell us
whether or not the circuit was good, and you know how that
goes -- if something goes wrong, it turns into a finger-pointing
match. Now we can do the trouble-shooting and provide the
solution ourselves."

  The switch to digital also means better quality for McDonald
using less bandwidth. The 16 kilobit/second of bandwidth required
for compressed voice provides "much better quality with full 64k
analog circuit," according to Perez. "It's super -- that was a
surprise to us."

  The digital circuits running from the firm's main office in
Cleveland to the branches are T.1s provided by Litel
Communications Inc. International, a regional long-distance
provider that will carry traffic at 56 kilobits/second. The
McDonald segment of the network uses X.25 connections; a packet
assembler/disassembler (PAD) in each branch is linked with an
Infotron 8020 multiplexer that communicates with another Infotron
mux located in the branch.

  Gradison, in contrast, is reliant upon TCP/IP and its link
between the UNIX-based LAN supporting broker workstations in
Cincinnati and the Internet Protocol: a Proteon router at
Gradison in Cincinnati is connected via two 56 kilobit/second
lines to a Proteon router in Cleveland.

                        Switch and Cut Bait

  At first, McDonald installed four PC-based Level 2 packet
switches, at a cost of just $15,000 each, as the center cloud.
The firm bought Netrix X.25 software. But the PC-based packet
switches were too slow to keep up with the UNIX processors in the
branches. As a result, the X.25 connection was cleared, and the
branch users were forced to log on again.

  "The whole circuit went down," Gettig says. "It was as bad as
going up with a pair of cutters and cutting the line. We couldn't
find the problem, because it was difficult to tell where the
clear was coming from."

  To solve their problem, McDonald executives invested in Level 3
hardware. That doesn't come cheap -- the Infotron Streamline 2550
cost McDonald in the neighborhood of $140,000.

  McDonald worried the Streamline 2550 might be overkill. But it
has worked well when combined with network-monitoring equipment.
Network management personnel at McDonald are now able to see
where the clears are coming from via a graphical map displayed at
headquarters in Cleveland: they can then run tests to a given
branch, and Litel can loop back to a different part of the fiber
circuit until they are able to isolate the origin of the problem.

  "One of the main things we learned was not to try to scrimp on
the cost of the hardware," Gettig says. "We got halfway rolled
out -- six or eight branches -- and that thing [the PC-based
solution] was enough to drive us out of a job. We ended up taking
a big hit from the small inexpensive network. Nobody could put a
dollar value on management and troubleshooting, but those are the
things that gave us sleepless nights. We knew there were problems
but we couldn't find them."

INTERSTATE/JOHNSON LANE ADDS
FUNCTIONS TO VSAT NETWORK

  Charlotte, N.C.-based Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc. has begun to
migrate its hoot 'n' holler branch application from AT&T land
lines to the ADP satellite network the firm has already installed
for market data delivery to more than 62 branches in the
Southeast. The regional broker believes the hoot 'n' holler move
to satellite will save the firm $150,000 per year once it's
completed this summer.

  Interstate has set up three sites to test the ADP network in
anticipation of a branch-wide hoot 'n' holler rollout scheduled
for Aug. 1, according to Glenn Mabry, first vice president,
telecommunications.

  Interstate was the first ADP customer to receive the FS Partner
data service via very small aperture terminal (VSAT) network, a
conversion process that began in October 1991 and was completed
this past February.

  Interstate/Johnson Lane was also the first ADP customer to use
Personal Earth Stations from Hughes Network Systems (HNS) as part
of Hughes' exclusive agreement with ADP for VSAT network
services. The ADP contract gives Hughes exclusive rights to the
installation and maintenance of the earth stations at ADP's
clients.

  Metromedia Communications Corp., a long distance vendor based
in East Rutherford, N.J., will remain the primary vendor for
Interstate's basic voice service; the firm has no immediate plans
to implement video on the network.

                        Making the Switch

  As part of the firm's switch to a VSAT network, an HNS Personal
Earth Station has been installed at each Interstate branch in
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. A Direct Indoor Unit
(DIU) interfaces with the VSAT dish to deliver both the hoot 'n'
holler application and FS Partner to the IBM PS/2 servers in
place at Interstate branch offices.

  The ADP/Hughes satellite network can support speeds of 512
kilobits/second outbound and 128 kilobits/second inbound.
Interstate, however, doesn't expect its traffic to exceed 64
kilobits/second. The ADP network traffic is downlinked to the HNS
hub in Spring Creek, N.Y. The company will not be incorporating
its own information with ADP's market data.

  In 1989, the Interstate/Johnson Lane network was 100 percent
terrestrial, with long distance lines provided primarily by AT&T
and MCI. But I/JL was plagued by what Mabry calls "the
vulnerability of land lines" -- mainly downtime and noise on the
line. Another factor in its switch to VSAT was speed of
installation and/or relocation. With AT&T any change or new
installation generally took from 60 to 90 days; I/JL is trying to
negotiate a 30-day turnaround time with ADP.

  Interstate examined three VSAT options: Avdata Systems in
Atlanta; Hughes on its own without ADP; and ADP using Hughes'
technology. Despite the cost savings that comes from integrated
voice and data, the four chief criteria for selection, according
to Mabry, were quality service; guaranteed uptime (with automatic
dialup backup); the ability to integrate voice and data; and "the
flexibility of relocation or installation."

  ADP had both feet in the door. The company had been
Interstate/Johnson Lane's back-office vendor since 1985, and its
market data provider since 1986. "We needed to get their service
into us in the most efficient way," Mabry says. "They came [to
the VSAT network discussions] as our quote service vendor."
Interstate conducted a pilot with ADP and Hughes before making
its final choice.

  Interstate is one of several regional firms exploring VSAT for
branch communications. In 1988, before ADP's deal with Hughes,
Edward D. Jones & Co., a regional broker based in St. Louis,
awarded HNS a $30 million contract for a VSAT network expected to
reach more than 2,000 broker sites by the end of this year.
Hughes is also installing a 400-node network for A.G. Edwards.
Additionally, ADP is in the early stages of a network rollout
with regional broker J.C. Bradford & Co., based in Nashville.

  "They are more receptive to satellite technology," says Pradman
Kaul, president of Hughes Network Systems, "because they all have
the same requirements: rapid response time, high-quality
transmission of data, flexibility if they move or install a new
office, and specialized applications like hoot 'n' holler."

AMID UNCERTAINTY, CTFI BUILDS
BACKUP FOR WALL STREET FIRMS

  Three years after 14 Wall Street Telecommunications Association
member firms announced plans to develop a hot site in case of a
network disaster, no contingency planning facility has been
built, and the vendor selected by the WSTA group has been forced
to market its facility with nothing more than the consortium's
endorsement to show for its winning proposal.

  Contingency Trading Facility Inc., based at MetroTech Center in
Brooklyn and majority-owned by competitive access provider
Metropolitan Fiber Systems Inc., was selected as the "winner" of
the request for proposal issued by the Disaster Recovery Hot Site
consortium. The consortium was formed in 1989 by the 14 WSTA
member firms, but now that CTFI has been selected as the hot site
vendor, the group agreed that its work was complete and has
disbanded. CTFI has won an endorsement with no explicit dollar
value from a WSTA group that no longer exists.

  "The award allowed us the right to go out and market to the
WSTA member firms," MFS vice president Kathy Perone says. "But it
did not guarantee any number of seats, or that the 14 WSTA firms
would use the site. We got an endorsement, and we are marketing
to all financial firms."

  "The [WSTA] group basically looked at their experience with
Wall Street requirements," says a key member of the Hot Site
consortium. "We looked at the proposal, and the recommendation
was based on networking flexibility and the location of the
facility. Based on those, CTFI had the wherewithal -- they were
better than the closest alternative."

  At least one member of the Hot Site consortium has committed to
a rival that "lost" in the bidding process -- Exchange Resources
Inc. of Minneapolis.

  "It was difficult to understand what it is you would win," says
one of the "losers" in the RFP process. "It was extremely
nebulous throughout, and we have since found there was nothing to
be won -- nothing to win."

  The purpose of the contingency facility is to provide
alternative network routing and access to market data feeds for
traders should a disaster cripple their own facilities. Though
MFS is claiming that 55 percent of the seats at the as-yet
unbuilt CTFI MetroTech Center contingency site have been sold,
Wall Street firms have been required only to put down deposits to
reserve seats.

  A "shared" seat at the facility costs $4,000 per year; a "semi-
shared" seat is $6,000 per year; and a "dedicated seat" is priced
at $11,000 per year. Contracts are for a minimum of three years.
Dedicated seats are 100 percent guaranteed under all
circumstances. Sharing guarantees subscribers will have access
to, at worst, a percentage of the seats contracted for: 50
percent for semi-dedicated; 25 percent for shared.

  CTFI plans to go live before year end. Other than the original
14 consortium firms, CTFI principal Jim Loizidez says his company
is in discussions with "another 25 WSTA companies" and that CTFI/
MFS are "now prospecting about 75 customers" in all.

  "They are actually waiting for the Wall Street community to
come in with some commitments," says the source. "I don't know if
there are enough to go forward.... I believe we are basically on
hold while we wait for the CTFI to formalize commitments."

  For $2,000 each, the 14 Hot Site consortium firms were able to
formulate requirements for a site that few felt they could afford
on their own. But it is also clear that needs have changed in the
time since the Hot Site consortium surveyed WSTA members and
first disseminated its RFP in October 1991. The RFP was designed
to delineate common requirements, but in fact MFS has been
deluged with requests for additional data feeds and
customization.

  Customers are asking for things outside the scope of the
original RFP: additional market data services, connections to
international carriers, access to their long-distance
providers -- and even storage space and the ability to bring
nontrading functions to the CTFI facility.

  Ironically, one of the prime beneficiaries of the "endorsement"
from the WSTA member firms will be MFS competitor New York
Telephone, which operates the Securities Industry Automation
Network. According to one source, MFS has already ordered some
200 lines from New York Tel; MFS has also announced a partnering
agreement with NYNEX Computer Services to provide consulting
services for disaster recovery to Wall Street customers. New York
Tel is even involved in designing the CTFI facility.

                           The Hot Site

  At the Brooklyn Hot Site, CTFI will provide a 60-button V Band
Corp. digital turret at each seat, with market data delivered by
a Reuters Triarch 2000 data distribution system. CTFI will
provide the Reuters Selectfeed and Telerate TDPF feeds for each
trader position. Quotron, ADP and Telekurs are under evaluation
to provide equities data.

  There are plans for five separate trading rooms of 50 seats
apiece at the facility in Brooklyn, each with a Novell local area
network connected to a Digital Equipment Corp. VAX minicomputer;
the VAX will act as feed handler and local controller for
incoming and outgoing communications.

  Subscribers will also have the option to connect feeds from
their back-office operations to traders' temporary stations in
Brooklyn via a System Network Architecture (SNA) gateway to the
DEC VAX. This allows for the interconnection of the traders'
back-office information to the CTFI VAX, accessible from
workstations.

  Individual voice and data lines can be re-routed through the
fiber networks of MFS or the Securities Industry Association
Network. According to Perone, MFS can switch the lines from the
New York Telephone Central Office (CO) that feeds the trader "and
shoot it into Brooklyn."

                          Discount Data

  CTFI also has the capability to pre-configure up to five
additional data feeds available through Reuters' Triarch 2000.
"We end up getting it cheaper than the traders' would
themselves," Loizides says, "because market data vendors realize
this is a backup site and they are giving us discounted feeds."

  Perone says the setup gives CTFI/MFS the ability "to turn them
on within 24 hours." The MFS network has direct fiber connections
from the company's midtown and downtown New York locations to the
MetroTech Center in Brooklyn.

  "The important thing is they are both fiber-optic-based
networks," Perone says. "That allows us to essentially look at a
circuit in two directions. If something happens, you can swing
the broken location to a third location. The Digital Cross-
Connect System acts as a controller -- it essentially allows you
to take one end of a private line and reconfigure to a third
location, such that traffic would appear to be transmitting over
the normal path. The duplicate services in Brooklyn would look
exactly like the traders are used to."

DOW JONES, NYNEX PURSUE PLAN
FOR WALL STREET VIDEO SERVICE

  Dow Jones and NYNEX aren't about to let the failure of Reuters'
TV 2000 in 1990 to stop them from exploring the market for both
store-and-forward and real-time video programming on Wall Street.
In an ambitious test of video over fiber already well into the
planning stages, both companies are trying to surmount the
technical and programming difficulties inherent in delivering
broadband services.

  The resulting product is expected to allow users of market data
to use digitized video in much the same way they use data now. If
Dow Jones and NYNEX are successful, users would be able to
monitor, store, and retrieve both real-time video and historical
video databases. Digital video with the properties of data could
open up a new revenue stream for network and market data vendors
on Wall Street -- and a new way of monitoring developments in the
financial world.

  For NYNEX, the project is the first thrust into video
programming since the restraints of the Modified Final Judgment
were lifted by an appeals court. For Dow Jones, it means a
chance to turn a glaring weakness in its Information Services
operation -- television programming -- into a presence in video
on Wall Street.

                           In the Field

  A prototype testing both the NYNEX network and the Dow Jones
programming is scheduled to be up and running by the end of the
year; if all goes well, a field test is set for the third quarter
of 1993. The operation will be based at Dow Jones headquarters at
One World Financial Center in New York, and at NYNEX's Science
and Technology Laboratory in White Plains, N.Y. The project will
be managed on the NYNEX side by its Telesector Resources Group
(TRG) as part of Dow Jones Television, headed by senior vice
president Peter Skinner, who reports to Dow Jones president Peter
Kann.

  The test will rely at first on "standard DS-1 connections,"
according to Joe DeMauro, director of new product development at
TRG. In the near-term, that means deploying the existing
dedicated point-to-point facilities of NYNEX Superpath, the 1.2
to 256 kilobit/second packet-switching service marketed by New
York Telephone. With Superpath, users have the capability of
establishing either permanent or temporary switched virtual
circuits between locations.

  DeMauro does expect the pilot will move to the 1.544 megabit
ISDN Primary Rate Interface -- once Primary Rate ISDN is tariffed
by the New York State Public Service Commission. A decision is
expected by July 24 (see story, page 1). Superpath relies on
dedicated facilities at two locations; ISDN PRI, by contrast, is
a switched connection that can be delivered to anyone with an
equivalent facility. ISDN will also allow for an end-to-end
digital connectivity.

  These networks will permit VCR-quality broadcasts: a step down
from broadcast quality, but probably good enough for a first-
generation business-to-business broadcast. The good news is that
the pilot will not suffer from "motion artifacts," the jumpiness
that often plagues video teleconferencing at lower baud rates. At
the slower data rates, any motion at all makes it look to the
viewer as though the signal itself has broken up, and the quality
of the picture is muddy compared to a network broadcast.

  The two companies have broken out the project into three
pieces: production of the programming; storage and distribution;
and delivery of the video service at the customer's premises. Dow
Jones will take care of the video programming piece, while NYNEX
will handle storage and distribution. The line has not yet been
clearly drawn as to how customer premises will be handled -- or
by whom. Should the service go commercial, Dow Jones expects that
third-party business alliance partners will perform the
integration function within the customer's premises -- as they
now do with other data feeds. As yet, no customer sites for the
prototype or the pilot have been announced.

  "The first step is technological," Peter Skinner says. "We have
to figure out how one transports a video feed over fiber in a
fashion that allows users to manipulate, store, and recall
programming the way you do now in an electronic database. We have
to figure out how one digitizes, stores, and retrieves video
information."

                          Easy Answers?

  NYNEX and Dow Jones have the advantage of trying to answer
those questions at a moment when international standards for the
transmission of digital video have stabilized. For store-and-
forward video, NYNEX will rely on the groundwork of the Motion
Picture Experts Group and its MPEG standard.

  For real-time video, DeMauro expects the partners will turn to
the international H.261 CCITT standard for transporting video to
codecs, the compression/decompression devices that are analogous
to modems for data. Thus, the test will benefit from standard
interfaces to codecs, and compatibility with the hardware and
software of a variety of manufacturers of video teleconferencing
products and services.

  NYNEX has to tread lightly when it comes to issues of content,
considering that cable and telephone companies are still barred
by federal law (the 1984 Cable Act) from entering the business of
the other; NYNEX has nicely side-stepped any immediate
controversy by leaving the programming side to Dow Jones. The
technical hurdles pertaining to delivery of video-on-demand
services are nothing compared to the programming issues Dow Jones
will have to conquer to grow the pilot into a commercial service.

  Dow Jones failed in its attempts to acquire Financial News
Network Inc. last year when the National Broadcasting Co.
absorbed FNN into the CNBC cable channel. Dow Jones may be an
information powerhouse in most media, but video has limped along
as a weak sibling. All that Dow Jones has to show on the
television side under its Dow Jones Television unit is the limpid
Wall Street Journal Report, a syndicated television show usually
shown at off-hours over the weekend on just 70 stations. With a
weekly magazine format, that half-hour show is broadcast by only
17 people total, a staff that also has responsibility to deliver
syndicated inserts into the broadcasts of news shows in local
markets and in Japan.

                      Are You Experienced?

  This dearth of video experience is daunting, considering that
Skinner is talking about Dow Jones providing everything from
"real-time breaking news to analytical, historical, archival, and
other programming we haven't thought of."

  "We have a lot of ideas about programming," he says. "Part of
our effort is to experiment with various types of programming."
Skinner said the "issue is open" as to relying on outside
suppliers of programming for the pilot. Of course, Dow Jones has
the option of drawing on the other parts of the company to
provide programming, but then so did Reuters when it came to the
defunct TV 2000.

  Exploration and exploitation of a new technology are two
different things, and video to date has been a minefield on Wall
Street, in large part because programming is a black hole. Don't
be surprised if Dow Jones and NYNEX fall into the programming
chasm between prototype and pilot. Jumping the technology hurdles
could turn out to be the easy part.

  Telekurs (North America) Inc. has increased the bandwidth of

  Telekurs (North America) Inc. has increased the bandwidth of
its Telekurs Ticker Service digital data feed from 19.2
kilobits/second to 56 kilobits/second. The increased speed brings
the Ticker feed up to a level comparable to Reuters' Marketfeed
2000 and PC Quote Inc.'s HyperFeed. The move was made because of
a planned expansion of the Ticker's content and "the beginnings
of a bandwidth problem," in the words of Steve Williams,
Telekurs' product manager for real-time systems.

  The seven Regional Bell Operating Companies and three
independent telcos have endorsed plans for local frame-relay and
switched multi-megabit data services. The RBOCs (Ameritech, Bell
Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Bell, Southwestern Bell
Telephone, and US WEST) and the independents (Cincinnati Bell,
GTE, and Southern New England Telephone) have given their support
to an agreement similar to one already announced by long-distance
carriers AT&T, Sprint, MCI, and BT North America. Frame-relay
service will begin this summer in the Ameritech region, and
multi-megabit transmission will be available on GTE facilities in
Los Angeles.

  Teleport Communications Group has appointed Charles "Chip"
Cleary as vice president of national markets. Cleary will be in
charge of selling TCG's local services to telecom carriers
nationwide. He had been director of ITT's Communications Services
division, and, most recently, he directed Eastern and Midwestern
sales for Metromedia Communications.

  Users of Instinet Corp.'s Order Management System have found it
can be used as a continuous crossing network, performing some of
the same functions as Morgan Stanley & Co.'s MatchPlus Patient
Trading system, according to sources at Grantham, Mayo, Van
Otterloo & Co., a test site for the system.

  If nothing else, the recent Chicago flood has forced another
round of CAP-think among telephone operating companies. "There
are two ways to deal with a bear that's in your territory: fight
it at all cost or sit down and have dinner," says Richard
Vanderwoude, president of Central Telephone Co. of Illinois, a
subsidiary of Centel. "Demand is growing so it's not a zero-sum
game. You look for that as a saving grace. We can share the pie
because the pie's getting bigger." Some telephone companies --
RBOC and independent -- consider that philosophy to be heretical.
But Vanderwoude believes the flood will lead "toward multiple
types of services -- two different paths, two different routes.
We'll see more and more of that. Customers want it now."

SAN DIEGO DEFERS VOTE ON PACIFIC BELL PCS DEPLOYMENT AFTER
OPPOSITION

     Pacific Bell suffered one-month setback last week in deploying
digital PCS network in San Diego, in time for Republican National
Convention Aug. 12-14, when City Council deferred action on
approving permits for antenna sites.  Council's 8-1 vote Feb. 12
came after sometimes heated meeting at which opponents of Global
System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology argued that
interference with hearing aids, pacemakers, wheelchairs and
electronic braking systems required city to study issue further
before voting.  City Attorney John Witt told Council in letter that
new Telecom Act restricts local govt. role in determining siting of
radio antennas.  Next meeting is March 19.

     PB blamed setback on "well-orchestrated" campaign by
D.C.-based Wireless Communications Council, headed by Hear-It-Now's
James Valentine, which opposes wide deployment of GSM technology. 
"We're disappointed by the Council vote," PB spokesman Lou Saviano
told us.  City Planning Commission earlier had approved PB's
request, but opponents appealed decision to full Council, which
heard testimony but deferred action.  He said city lawyers advised
Council that new Telecom Act supersedes local authority over such
issues in deploying national PCS system.

     Witt told us Sec. 704 of Telecom Act bans local govt. role in
regulating "placement, construction and modification" of PCS
facilities for frequency emissions, provided equipment complies
with FCC rules.  Lawyers for Council challenged legal opinion, and
law office is continuing to research laws, Witt said.

     PB officials said one-month delay in winning approvals won't
derail plans for network deployment, which includes 12 antenna
sites in city to handle phone calls during convention.  PB paid
$695 million for L.A. and San Francisco licenses and is building
network for Cal., most of Nev. and portion of Ariz.  Company plans
rollout of rest of network by year-end.

     Opponents of GSM technology, operating as Cal. Communications
Council and funded by D.C. group, urged City Council to investigate
technology before approving application.  Saviano described
opposition as "well orchestrated" and said company tried to offset
campaign with "facts and figures" about technology.  Advisory
Commission for Persons with Disabilities in Santa Clara County
wrote letter saying GSM phones create interference with assisted
listening devices (ALDs) in public buildings, and use of phones
could deny ALD users access to services.  Council sought
environmental impact report study as "only way" to resolve dispute
and "protect health and safety."

     In related development, Cal. State Architect Div. access
compliance unit issued letter saying it was preparing statewide
policy to address hearing aid interference.  Michael Mankin, assoc.
architect, said in letter to City Manager Regina Williams: 
"[Agency] suggests, if possible, that you consider this concern
when making any decision on the deployment of PCS 1900/GSM
telephones because they undermined the assistive listening devices
required in assembly occupancies in the State Building Code." 
Mankin said office is working with hearing-impaired community to
develop policy.

     PB plans to open San Diego network ahead of rest of state to
provide wireless services during political convention, even though
most delegates, candidates and media won't have equipment.  Some
from D.C. could use Sprint Spectrum telephones because GSM system
has been operating here since last year.  Phone can make all long
distance calls but won't operate outside 1.9 GHz territory.

AMERITECH, BELL ATLANTIC, SBC LAUNCH OUT-OF-REGION LONG DISTANCE
DRIVE

     Bell Atlantic (BA) and SBC Communications jumped quickly into
out-of-region long distance service last week, filing applications
in 18 states and D.C. to resell services under brand name.  At same
time, Ameritech unveiled aggressive plans for in-region long
distance and signed agreement with WorldTel to carry long distance
calls to cities outside region.  RHCs were first to enter
out-region business, with other companies expected to disclose
plans soon.  IXCs also began seeking state approval to deliver
local services.

     BA became first RHC to seek long distance authority outside
territory, filing applications Feb. 13 in Fla., Ill., N.C., S.C.
and Tex. just 3 days after Telecom Act freed RHCs to operate in new
regions.  SBC followed 2 days later with more extensive filing in
16 states and D.C., and in twist said it will use already
established Cellular One wireless brand name as vehicle for selling
wireline services to existing and new customers.  BA and SBC filed
separate applications in Ill., and SBC plans include many states in
BA's territory.

     BA Communications Pres. Al Binford said 5 states represented
prime opportunities for company as it begins building nationwide
service.  It could be offered on resale basis by end of 2nd
quarter, he said.  "These states are important states," he told us. 
BA plans to seek resale agreements with facilities-based carriers
in 5 states after winning state approval, Binford said.  Other RHCs
haven't indicated plans for filing in states.

     Company pledged last week to move quickly on state front,
saying it would submit applications within 5 days to provide
service in 5 states unidentified until Tues.  Binford said each
state represented significant opportunity for BA to provide service
for its existing customers, such as travelers to Disney World in
Fla.  Proximity of Carolinas to BA's territory, coupled with
existing cellular interests in those 2 states, will enhance BA
brand name in region, he said.  BA also is part of PCS partnership
that has licenses in Tex. and Ill. in addition to other markets.

     Eventually, company plans to have nationwide presence aiming
at targeted audiences rather than all customers, using mix of
advertising, including newspapers, Binford said.  He said first 5
states were "attractive," with large amounts of long distance
calling already in place.  He didn't provide details on timetable
for introducing service in other states.

     BellSouth (BS), which provides service in 3 of 5 states,
welcomed potential competition from neighboring company, saying BA
choice demonstrated "attractive" nature of Southeast for business. 
"We anticipate and expect to have a number of competitors in all
our markets," spokesman Tim Klein said.  BS has strategy for
meeting competition, he said, and has developed "very aggressive"
plan to meet checklist conditions for providing long distance
service in its own 7-state territory.  He said company expects to
meet checklist targets first in Fla., entering market as early as
year-end or early 1997.

     BA has said it expects to seek FCC and state approvals to
offer long distance service in its own territory as soon as rules
are established.  Its quick response to Telecom Act signals its
intention to provide long distance services quickly outside region
while concentrating on in-region checklist, officials said.  Other
RHCs have sketched out brief details of service offerings, most
beginning by providing long distance to cellular customers. 
Ameritech unveiled plans for in-region service but will carry
out-of-region calls through LDDS WorldCom.

          SBC Uses Cellular One Brand for Long Distance

     SBC Communications said it expected applications to be filed
by early this week, with regulatory approvals in 2-3 months. 
States generally are in Northeast and Upper Midwest, with further
plans still undisclosed, official said.  SBC plan relies on brand
name recognition of Cellular One, which has been in existence in
some states for decade.  SBC official said market had sufficient
room for numerous competitors.

     SBC targeted BA territory of Del., D.C., Md., Va. and W.Va.
and plans to seek approval in Conn., Ill., Ind., La., Me., Mass.,
Miss., N.H., N.Y., R.I. and Vt.  "We're building on our out-region
base," Chmn.-CEO Edward Whitacre said.  States either are adjacent
to SBC's 5-state territory or to Cellular One network.  Official
said company has tested Cellular One brand recognition and doesn't
expect obstacles in offering wireline services.  In competition
with BA, SBC official said Cellular One brand has high name
recognition in all 16 states and BA lacks presence or name
recognition in at least 3 of its 5 launch states.  Spokesman Dave
Senay said:  "Competition will be nothing new for SBC or Bell
Atlantic."  In Md., for example, Cellular One and Bell Atlantic
Nynex Mobile are 2 cellular providers.

     SBC began offering long distance to cellular customers on
Cellular One and Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems (SBMS) as soon as
President Clinton signed Telecom Act.  Stanley Sigman, pres.-CEO of
SBMS unit that oversees Cellular One, said company expects
customers to select one company for local, cellular and long
distance.  "We'll build on the customer relationships and brand
recognition that characterize Cellular One," he said.  Goal is to
provide bundled services for all customers.

     In separate announcement, Teleport Communications Group (TCG)
unveiled plans for its Md. operation, saying it will invest $20
million in Baltimore by year-end, with $100 million more in next
several years.  TCG Md. Pres. Larry Bugden said company will add
200 employees to Baltimore operation, with 500 jobs created over
next 5 years by company or subcontractors.  "This is a best step
for us in the Baltimore market," he said.  "We can now capitalize
on the technological capability we already have in place."

                    IXCs Begin Local Filings

     LCI International and AT&T filed at Fla. PSC to provide local
service.  LCI already has approvals from Ill., N.Y., Tex.  It said
applications also are pending in Cal., Md., Mich.  Douglas Kinkoph,
PSC dir.-regulatory affairs, said Fla. is one of several states
"ripe" for entry because of promising markets and favorable
regulations.  AT&T said it would provide service for business and
residential customers in state, depending on negotiations with LECs
there, including BellSouth, GTE, Sprint/United Telephone.  AT&T
disclosed plans to begin offering service by resale agreements with
incumbent carriers, although Chmn.-CEO Robert Allen said company
could build own facilities in some areas.

                 Ameritech Targets In-State Goal

     Ameritech expects to offer in-region landline long distance in
9 to 13 months, with strongest start in Ill. and Mich., CEO Richard
Notebaert said.  Statement came in news conference unveiling long
distance cellular service, to be offered over long distance network
that company has built throughout its 5-state region, he said. 
Ameritech wouldn't provide details on cost of digital, fiber SONET
network or its capacity, but Notebaert said it would be enough for
cellular service.

     Efforts have focused in Chicago and Grand Rapids because
that's where Ameritech had Justice Dept. (DoJ) waiver to offer long
distance service, company said.  But landline service in all its
region will be available in at most 13 months, pending regulatory
approvals, Ameritech said.  Notebaert said adding long distance
capability to local network was not "significant" cost. 
Announcement also marked another plum for LDDS WorldCom, which will
provide out-of-region long distance service for Ameritech
customers, companies said.

     Notebaert declined to reveal how much of long distance market
Ameritech hopes to get.  Company spent much of news conference
touting cellular long distance, saying it would be priced at 16-24
cents per min., 10-35% less than long distance carriers.  Ameritech
said it had signed up 126,000 cellular customers in 36 hours since
service began.

TOP 10 OUTCOMES OF TELECOM ACT

     List prepared by consulting firm A.T. Kearney envisions more
RHC acquisitions and entertainment-telecom conglomerates as result
of Telecom Act.  According to Kearney, new law will:

 1. Force consolidations among interexchange carriers and RHCs.

 2. Give wireless carriers competitive advantage over wireline
carriers.

 3. Push state regulators to open local loop to competition.

 4. Open debate on definition of universal service, including
access to information services.

 5. Turn state regulators into implementers of federal policy.

 6. Postpone rate relief for cable systems until 1999, making cable
"vulnerable" to competitors.

 7. Enhance power of broadcast networks by increasing
cross-ownership opportunities.

 8. Set stage for TV licensees to acquire advanced TV spectrum.

 9. Foster growth of Internet.

10. Pave way for few $100-billion conglomerates to dominate world
market in communications, information, entertainment.

COURT TEMPORARILY BARS ENFORCEMENT OF TELECOM ACT'S INDECENCY LAW

     Despite Justice Dept.'s defense of new law, federal judge in
Philadelphia issued temporary restraining order Feb. 15 barring
govt. from enforcing controversial Internet indecency provision of
Telecom Act while case is before court.  Provision, known as
Communications Decency Act (CDA), prohibits making indecent
material available to minors over Internet.  ACLU and 19 other
groups have challenged provision on basis that law is too broad and
will chill speech on Internet.

     U.S. Dist. Judge Ronald Buckwalter appeared to endorse points
made by both sides in memo accompanying his order.  Buckwalter said
Congress has "compelling interest" in protecting minors and "at
least from the evidence before me, plaintiffs have not convinced me
that Congress has failed to narrowly tailor the CDA."  However, he
also said ACLU and others raised "serious, substantial, difficult
and doubtful questions" about whether CDA's use of word "indecent"
is "unconstitutionally vague."

     Buckwalter issued order several hours after DoJ filed brief
telling court there's no need for such action.  In 60-page brief,
Justice said that ACLU and 19 co-plaintiffs haven't met
extraordinary burdens necessary to block enforcement of new law. 
Buckwalter's decision clears way for 3-judge federal panel --
composed of Buckwalter, Dist. Judge Stuart Dalzell and Dolores
Sloviter, chief judge of 3rd U.S. Appeals Court, Philadelphia -- to
consider merits of CDA.

     In related activity, Sen. Leahy (D-Vt.) said that he has
private support of senators for repeal of law, but that chances are
public support won't materialize.  And 6th U.S. Appeals Court,
Cincinnati, upheld conviction of operators of pornographic computer
bulletin board operator in Cal. under Tenn. community standards,
where material from board was downloaded.

                 DoJ Questions ACLU Conclusions

     Justice brief frequently focused on argument that ACLU hadn't
met burden of proof at this stage of case, saying that conclusions
brought by challengers to law haven't been proved sufficiently to
warrant declaring law unconstitutional and because there's no proof
of irreparable injury should law be allowed to take effect.  DoJ
said:  "Plaintiffs fail to show a realistic threat of suppression
of their speech."  Claims that free speech on Internet would be
hurt by new law are "wholly speculative," DoJ said, contending that
ACLU based claims of harm on nothing more than "their own academic
reading of the statute."  Justice said there was ample evidence of
pornographic material on Internet and amount is growing, "far
exceeding anything available prior to the advent of on-line
computer services."  It was concern over that availability that led
to passage of law, Justice contended.

     ACLU argument that indecency portions of law are too vague fly
in face of several years of court decisions, Justice said, noting
that cases involving broadcast language and dial-a-porn touched on
many of same topics.  Congress in passing law "neither purported to
ban, nor effectively ban, on-line indecency in all its various
forms," as ACLU contended, DoJ said.  "Those who create or 'post'
indecent images or texts in cyberspace are on notice that they are
free to do so, so long as they have taken reasonable and
appropriate measures to block access to children effectively." 

     DoJ concluded that Congress knew what it was doing when it
passed Telecom Act, based on extensive record including floor
speeches and hearings.  But one senator, Leahy, said at Washington
news conference same day that many in Congress don't understand
technology.  He was pessimistic that legislation (S-1567) he
introduced with Sen. Feingold (D-Wis.) would get very far.  While
senators privately agree with him on merits of repeal, they're
afraid of 30-sec. attack ads portraying them as proponents of
pornography, Leahy said, adding that he was worried lawmakers are
afraid to stand up for First Amendment.  Leahy said "chilling
effect" on Internet speech already has emerged, citing case of
America Online, which threw off its system Vt. subscriber for using
word "breast."  She was discussing her cancer, Leahy said. 
Americans shouldn't be too quick to criticize Chinese for their
attempts to censor Internet, he said, because much same thing is
happening here.

     Meanwhile, in separate case with similar implications, 6th
U.S. Appeals Court, Cincinnati, upheld conviction of operators of
Cal.-based Amateur Action Bulletin Board.  That case dealt with
obscenity, which is illegal, as opposed to indecent material, on
which there's great difference of opinion.  Attorneys for Robert
and Carleen Thomas argued that community standards for obscenity in
Cal. were different from those in Tenn., where postal inspector
downloaded material from Thomas's service.  Thomases were convicted
2 years ago in U.S. Dist. Court, Memphis, of violating obscenity
statutes.

FCC PROPOSES RULES FOR RHCs OFFERING OUT-OF-REGION TOLL SERVICE

     In most significant response so far to Telecom Act, FCC opened
rulemaking Feb. 14 that proposes giving nondominant regulatory
status to RHC affiliates offering out-of-region long distance
service.  As nondominant carriers, RHC affiliates could begin
offering service almost immediately upon filing their tariffs. 
Commission also proposed that if RHCs offer such out-of-region
service directly, rather than through affiliates, they should be
regulated as dominant carriers.

     To be classified as nondominant, RHC affiliate would have to
meet separation conditions outlined in 1985 Competitive Carrier
Order.  Affiliate would have to:  (1) Maintain separate accounting
books.  (2) Have no joint ownership of transmission or switching
facilities with RHC's LEC.  (3) Obtain all RHC exchange company
services at tariffed rates and conditions.  FCC noted that
independent LECs are classified as nondominant in long distance
market and operate under same rules.

     Commission asked for comments on tentative conclusion and said
parties that disagree with plan should offer alternative regulatory
policies.  Action is required by fact that Telecom Act eliminates
MFJ ban on telcos' offering interLATA service.  Nondominant
classification is given to carriers that don't have enough market
power to engage in anticompetitive conduct.

     In notice of proposed rulemaking, Commission said it wants to
"permit efficient and rapid entry" by RHCs but at same time "we
also seek to ensure that sufficient regulatory safeguards are in
place to prevent a BOC from gaining any unfair competitive
advantage."

     Nynex praised FCC plan, Federal Regulatory Affairs Vp Don
Evans saying action "brings Nynex one step closer to offering long
distance telephone users greater choice."

IXCs TO SEEK NICHES AS THEY PREPARE FOR LOCAL, BUNDLED SERVICES
BATTLE

     Second-tier IXCs, like Big 3 counterparts, will accelerate
offerings of local and bundled services as result of passage of
Telecom Act, they said last week.  LDDS WorldCom and Frontier,
which rank 4th and 5th among IXCs, said they will target largest
business customers, taking on RHCs, AT&T, MCI and Sprint in short
run.  No. 6 LCI International said it will seek broader market,
including residential, small, medium and large businesses.  Cable
& Wireless targeted 2,000 companies ranked below Fortune 500.  All
said they are interested in offering full range of telecom services
and at this stage won't rule out any service or market.

     With own fiber network, LDDS WorldCom will aim for customers
doing at least $500 per month in business, spokesman Gil Broyles
said, and existing customer base will be important.  LDDS filed in
Ill., Mich. and Tex. to enter local market, but he wouldn't
identify first launch state.  He said important factor will be how
LECs set rates for resale capacity.  It also will look at how
states set guidelines to create attractive rates, spokesman said. 
"That's the kind of the next thing that needs to be done," Broyles
said.  LDDS is providing interLATA service for resale to
Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Ameritech, GTE.  Talks are
"continuing" with another unidentified LEC, he said.

     Frontier, with $2.1 billion in 1995 revenue, will compete
"door-to-door" with Big 3 to offer bundled services to Fortune 500
companies, Vp John Purcell said.  "We've got real blood to show"
for combat already, he said.  Frontier jumped to No. 5 ranking
after buying ALC last year and combined companies provide long
distance, local and wireless services to more than 2 million
customers.  Purcell said Telecom Act's requirement for LECs to show
competition before entering long distance created incentive for
Nynex to negotiate favorable rates with Frontier on bundling
services.  He declined to specify where Frontier's next local
services might appear.  However, among 120 sales offices in U.S.,
2/3 are in "opportune" markets for bundled offerings, Purcell said,
and about 40 offices are in regions with regulatory barriers.

     LCI International is likely to pursue broader market,
including residential and business customers of all kinds, and
improve on its $693 million annual revenue, Regulatory Affairs Dir.
Douglas Kinkoph said.  LCI's 200% growth in residential revenue
prompted interest in developing market, he said.  LCI's long
distance marketing, based on what he said were "simple, fair and
inexpensive" services, will be thrust of local offerings, he said. 
LCI now offers flat-rate calling plans and 6-sec. billing option,
unlike competitors, Kinkoph said.  Unlike AT&T, LCI doesn't foresee
building its own facilities to provide local service, he said.

     LCI provides Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile with long distance
service that regional cellular carrier resells to its 3 million
customers.  LCI currently doesn't offer any form of local service,
Kinkoph said.  "No state today is ready to accept local service." 
Spokeswoman Gerry Simone said company is eager for states to set
discount rates.  "Until we know what our price is, we don't know
what our products will be," she said.  In anticipation of state
action, LCI filed at Fla. PSC Feb. 15 to provide local service. 
Kinkoph said Fla. is one of several states "ripe" for entry,
regardless of Telecom Act, because of promising markets and
favorable local regulations.  However, Simone said, should pricing
prove unsatisfactory, LCI also sees options, such as cable, that
could preclude entry into local voice services.  LCI has approvals
from Ill., N.Y. and Tex., with applications pending in Cal., Md.,
Mich.

     Cable & Wireless (C&W) will carve niche by offering bundled
services to 2,000 companies ranked below Fortune 500, company said. 
C&W has approvals from Conn. and N.Y. and has filed applications in
Cal., Ill. and Tex. to provide local service, company said. 
Official offered rankings for C&W's best opportunities:  (1) N.Y. 
(2) Conn.  (3) Cal., Ill., Tex. tied.  Company launched UniLink
bundled local-long distance in N.Y.C. area.  Official said company
targeted Conn. for greatest investment to offer local services to
businesses.  Conn. PSC recently set Southern New England Telephone
(SNET) resale discounts at 20%-50%, which official said will
trigger aggressive competition.  State granted C&W LEC status,
making company first IXC to buy from SNET.  In Tex., C&W will limit
its resale relationship with Southwestern Bell, citing
dissatisfaction with discount rates and "not very attractive"
economics, official said.

RHCs EXPECTED TO DELAY IN-REGION LONG DISTANCE UNTIL FCC FINISHES
CHECKLIST

     FCC Chmn. Hundt said talks with RHC executives indicate they
won't apply for in-region long distance service until Commission
finishes writing rules for checklist that RHCs must pass, process
that could take about 180 days.  He made comment at Feb. 12 news
conference at which FCC released "task list" of 80 rulemakings
required by Telecom Act of 1996 (see pullout feature in this
issue).  List outlines which bureaus will handle various items and
what deadlines they face, most of them in 1996.  Hundt said
Commission hopes to beat deadlines wherever possible.

     Hundt said FCC is excited about opportunities presented by
Act:  "All along we've wanted the chance to write rules that go to
a competitive market.  Our reach for competition no longer exceeds
our grasp."  Move toward competition means that "in the
communications sector, the era of big government is over," he said. 
Two key goals, he said, are to promote competition rather than
individual competitors and to protect "the public interest
forever."

     Asked how FCC will get work done without budget increase it
had sought, Hundt said it will continue urging Hill to provide more
money but "at the same time, we're hitting the ground running." 
Asked how Commission will get routine work done while it
concentrates on implementation, he said "one answer is, don't try
to do everything the same old way.  We're going to need ideas."

     FCC Wireless Bureau met with industry and public interest
representatives day later to discuss ways to make filing processes
more efficient in light of tight deadlines.  Bureau asked parties
to submit short filings, not seek unnecessary meetings and focus on
proceedings with most immediate deadlines, rather than submitting
information for proceedings that are farther down road.  "Don't
give us the rhetoric and don't paper us to death," FCC Chief of
Staff Blair Levin said.  Industry also can help by developing data
that agency needs to make decisions, bureau staffers said.  Bureau
Chief Michele Farquhar said Bureau in turn will help public by
using new home page on Internet for updates on progress.

     Hundt said other bureaus may hold similar meetings, and
Commission also is considering actions such as page limitations,
open forums where agency staff can question parties more directly,
joint filings when several parties have same view.  As expected,
open video systems proceeding has been moved to Cable Bureau from
Common Carrier Bureau to spread workload.  "Our intent is to have
all the bureaus challenged but not overwhelmed," Hundt said.

     Meanwhile, FCC has received first filing under new Act --
application by CSW Communications, affiliate of utility company
Central & South West Corp., to be classified as "exempt
telecommunications company."  Classification would mean it's bona
fide communications company and thus exempt from Public Utility
Holding Company Act restrictions on offering telecom services. 
Office of Gen. Counsel has 60 days to make determination.

JUSTICE DEPT. SAYS TELCO-CABLE BAN CASE IS MOOT BECAUSE OF TELECOM
ACT

     Passage of Telecom Act makes moot U.S. Supreme Court case
testing constitutionality of telco-cable cross-ownership ban, U.S.
Justice Dept. said in court filing.  However, Bell Atlantic (BA)
argued that case isn't moot because, despite legislation, ban
remains in effect for at least 6 months while FCC sets rules for
telco entry into cable.

     Telecom Act means there's no limit on telcos' building cable
systems in their service areas, Justice Dept. said, although it
acknowledged that Act includes some restrictions such as 10%
maximum ownership of incumbent cable operators.  However, Justice
said limits in Act aren't before Court and haven't been tried at
lower levels, so Supreme Court shouldn't consider them, and
cross-ownership case remains moot.  Brief urged court to vacate
U.S. Appeals Court, Alexandria, Va., decision and order lower court
to dismiss case.

     "Sweeping" Telecom Act means that, "at a minimum, the
legislation has been sufficiently altered so as to present a
substantially different controversy than the one the lower courts
originally decided," Justice said.  "Even if the new legislation
does burden the LECs operating open video systems to a modest
degree... it surely does not burden them in the same fundamental
way" as was argued in appeal and "it would not be appropriate for
this court... to review the constitutionality of the new law, which
has not been the subject of briefing and argument."

     Telecom Act "does not moot this case," BA contended, because
it "substitutes new provisions that keep in place, for at least 6
months, the prohibition on a telephone company's provision of video
programming."  It said Act allows telco open video systems only if
they comply with FCC rules, and "no such rules exist today."  Act
gives FCC 6 months to establish rules and BA said "absence of
regulations in the interim translates into a continuation of the
flat prohibition on speech."

     "Far from mooting the controversy, the Act perpetuates the
controversy," BA said.  "It does no more than require the FCC, at
some point in the future, to take regulatory action that might then
moot this case."  Prolonging ban "will produce irreparable injury"
to telcos, BA said, and there's no major burden on Supreme Court to
issue decision, since case has been briefed, argued and Court has
deliberated on it.

     World of "fierce" competition coupled with reduced govt.
regulation will result from Telecom Act, FCC Comr. Chong said in
speech to FCBA Midwest Chapter Feb. 15 in Chicago.  New law will
let FCC "sweep away regulatory underbrush," she said, noting that
Commission has been "trying to regulate in a Star Trek era, saddled
with Gunsmoke-style regulations."  She predicted that consumers
would have "choices galore":  "Every home, business, school,
library and health care facility will have access to multiple
communications providers, at reasonable prices."  Providers may be
wired, wireless, maybe both, she said:  "Providers will not fit
neatly into traditional categories... Instead, they will likely
evolve into full-service communications companies, offering
consumers a tempting smorgasbord of services."

such action is "explicitly authorized" by Telecom Act.  Hyperion is

instituted such policy several years ago but it was thrown out in
1994 by U.S. Supreme Court ruling on AT&T challenge.  Court had
said FCC didn't have enough authority to forbear on requiring
tariff filings.  Hyperion said Telecom Act now gives FCC that
authority.

that already have been rejected, Commission said.  In past, agency
merely has issued warnings against such filings.  Now, it said,
"all bureaus and offices are encouraged to fully utilize" power to
punish violators, including fines and authority to strike such
pleadings.  Also, said Commission, bureaus "are encouraged to refer
under seal" to gen. counsel names of attorneys making frivolous
pleadings for appropriate action, which could include censure,
suspension or disbarment.

     FCC gave Ameritech access charge flexibility in Chicago and

     FCC gave Ameritech access charge flexibility in Chicago and
Grand Rapids LATAs similar to that approved for Nynex last year. 
Ameritech sought waivers as part of its Customers First plan. 
Waivers will allow company to:  (1) Bulk-bill portions of its
access charges rather than bill on per-min. basis.  (2)
Geographically deaverage one type of access charge called transport
interconnection charge (TIC).  FCC said Ameritech can reduce TIC in
competitive areas but can't raise it in other areas to compensate. 
Actions are expected to result in overall reduction of Ameritech
access charges, possibly in neighborhood of "tens of millions of
dollars," FCC staff member said.  Commission stopped short of
granting full pricing flexibility sought by Ameritech, saying it
would address that issue in future order.  Although action is aimed
at giving Ameritech more flexibility when it faces competition,
rivals say it's premature.  Heather Gold, exec. dir. of Assn. for
Local Telecommunications Services (ALTS), said she's "outraged" by
decision because it lets Ameritech undercut competitors.  She said
that, while Grand Rapids LATA covers about 25% of Mich., Ameritech
could lower access rates selectively only in metropolitan Grand
Rapids, where there's competition from Brooks Fiber.  Action "sets
a bad precedent by inhibiting competition just one week after the
signing of a bill which has the purpose of encouraging
competition," Gold said.  FCC Comr. Barrett said in separate
statement that while he supports decision, action emphasizes need
for comprehensive access charge reform.

survey said, adding that cost and inadequate wiring remain biggest
hurdles.  Survey came day after President Clinton unveiled
$2-billion campaign to help connect schools to computer networks.

     U.S. Dist. Judge Harold Greene, in what could be his last

     U.S. Dist. Judge Harold Greene, in what could be his last
action dealing with AT&T breakup, said in order issued Feb. 8 that
he was "pleased that Congress and the President have now agreed to
set policy for the telecommunications industry."  He said that will
"relieve this court of its stewardship of that industry [telephone
segment of telecom] which, in a sense, it had exercised since
competition was introduced by the judicially ordered breakup of
AT&T."  But Greene said in brief order that his relief "is
mitigated only by a single concern:  That under the bill just
enacted it could turn out that sufficient safeguards do not exist
to prevent domination in the future of the vital information
industry by a few large providers."  He said that if that were to
come about through mergers, acquisitions or other deals, it not
only would have detrimental effect on consumers but also could
"enable a few giant companies (or perhaps even individuals) to
dominate what is rapidly becoming the central factor of American
life -- the control of the dissemination of information in its many
forms."  "Evils of monopoly would be magnified by domination of the
key information industry by one or a few corporations," he said. 
However, he added:  "These problems are now for the Congress and
for another day."  He said he "gladly relinquishes the
responsibility [he] has exercised for the past 15 years over the
telephone segment of the provision of information in the United
States."  He said any parties with motions before court had 20 days
to file papers on whether relief sought in those motions still
could be granted as result of new law.

     Telecom Act will return nation to days when consumer had same

     Telecom Act will return nation to days when consumer had same
carrier for local and long distance service, only difference being
that they now will have choice as to who that provider is, said
panelists at Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS)
roundtable last week.  They said more deals like one recently
floated by AT&T and MCI can be expected because "everybody is
talking to everybody else."  AT&T Vp Michael Brown said
re-integration of local and long distance providers is
"inevitable," and long distance companies will have some advantages
such as experience in competitive and international markets, and
high name recognition.  However, he said, RHCs also have facilities
and high name recognition in their markets, and can control resale
prices.  Former FCC Chmn. Richard Wiley noted that RHCs have state
and local competition checklists to pass before they can move
forward, while long distance companies have no such requirement. 
Nynex Vp Jeff Ward said there will be 3-4 facilities-based carriers
per major market plus various value-added service providers.  LCI
International CEO Brian Thompson said RHCs may be challenged if
they seek to enter long distance markets via existing cellular
operations without meeting effective-competition standards.  He
also said that for competition to flourish, facilities of local
providers should be made available to resellers on reasonable
terms.  Ward said his company is positioning itself to be
"carriers' carrier" in approaching new telecom environment. 
Viacom's Ellen Schned said new law will have positive impact on
program distribution business because it will increase number of
distributors.  Without programming, she said, "a wire is just a
wire" and inclusion of more players like telcos will mean "more
eyeballs" that can see company's programs.

     MCI and AT&T have opened talks on possible joint business

     MCI and AT&T have opened talks on possible joint business
ventures, especially building local phone networks but possibly
covering other activities.  MCI cited AT&T's breakup into separate
service and equipment units and new Telecom Act of 1996 as
catalysts for talks between No. 1 and No. 2 IXCs.  MCI officials
were reluctant to offer details on discussions and AT&T declined to
comment on speculation.  "We're going to discuss a lot of things
with a lot of people," MCI official said.  Officials hinted talks
might take weeks or months to reach satisfactory conclusion for
either company.  MCI challenge to AT&T's monopoly in April 1974 led
to Bell System divestiture.  MCI said discussions, in earliest
stages, could include equipment purchases from new Lucent
Technologies company being formed from AT&T's old Network Systems
unit.  MCI-AT&T linkup also could be strategy to force RHCs to
offer improved discounts on resale rates, said William Giak,
national product dir., telecom and electric service, Deloitte &
Touche consulting.  "These [AT&T-MCI] negotiations would add a
dimension of pressure" in talks with RHCs, he said.

     U.S. Supreme Court decision on indecency on cable access

     U.S. Supreme Court decision on indecency on cable access
channels could have significant impact on legality of Telecom Act
provision allowing on-line service providers to limit indecency on
their services, Alliance for Community Media (ACM) said.  Oral
argument on case is set for Feb. 21.  Court decision, due in June,
is expected to hinge on whether federal rules allowing, rather than
requiring, private companies to limit indecency constitute "state
action" subject to strict First Amendment scrutiny.  In cable case,
ACM argued that such provisions actively encouraged private
companies to limit speech, so rules faced tough First Amendment
limits.  If court agrees, ACM Exec. Dir. Barry Forbes said, same
argument may be applied to on-line indecency provision.  "Anyone
who cares about the fundamental American right to free speech
should be watching closely the outcome of Alliance vs. FCC," Forbes
said.

     U S West is claiming 30% market share for its TeleChoice cable

     U S West is claiming 30% market share for its TeleChoice cable
testbed in Omaha after only 4 months, it said in quarterly
financial report.  RHC said it isn't claiming 30% penetration of
all 42,000 households in Western Omaha passed by interactive
testbed, only 30% of all households in area that buy any type of
cable services.  However, incumbent cable operator Cox said it has
had no significant net loss in number of subscribers since U S West
launch.  "We are very delighted in our performance in protecting
our market share," said Michael Kohler, community & govt. relations
mgr. for Cox system.  He acknowledged that system lost "some"
customers to U S West, but said they have largely been replaced by
new subscribers.  Competition has meant "all-time-high" cable
penetration in competitive area, Kohler said, but "I'm not sure
that it has grown enough to support everyone's claims."  Cox
spokeswoman said subscribership in Omaha increased 4% in 1995,
about same level as MSO-wide.  U S West has undercut Cox prices
somewhat, Kohler said, but Cox claims that with its free
line-maintenance plan, prices and program packages are "very
comparable."  Another cable operator overbuilt by U S West, Douglas
County Cablevision, has cut prices somewhat, and each of operators
is offering package discounts, but overall rates in Omaha area
haven't fallen significantly as result of testbed, Kohler said.

     Local implementation of Telecom Act of 1996 will produce
challenges to state commissions -- many of which are spread thin to
meet existing demands, said Lee Palagyi of National Assn. of
Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) in interview with Telecom
Monitor.  She's NARUC staff representative on congressional issues
and Ohio PUC aid to Comr. Jolynn Butler.  Key challenges will be: 
Meeting federal deadlines for interconnection;  assessing universal
service requirements;  drafting rules that seamlessly link with FCC
rules.  "It's difficult for states to get an accurate view on this
yet," she said.  "On the whole I'd say the states are prepared"
although small commissions and states not on path to competition
may be "overwhelmed" by new policy making, she said.  States such
as Cal., N.Y. and Ohio will be models, Palagyi said, but even those
may be "inundated" by flood of company filings.

     Wyo. PSC rejected AT&T bid to reconsider its approval of new
U S West (USW) pricing plan that would raise local rates and cut
in-state long distance, saying petition "restated, repeated and
rehashed" arguments made at public hearings.  New rates took effect
Feb. 15.  Commission earlier approved plan that raises most local
charges and lowers long distance average of 16% over 2 years to end
subsidy that covered some local costs.  AT&T said it was "extremely
disappointed" by denial, which it said allows USW to cut toll
services to level that "undisputedly fails" to include 80% of costs
of providing services, resulting in below-cost rate that it said
will hurt competitors.  Effect of pricing is to boost USW revenue
by $5.46 million, AT&T said.  It said PSC action "struck a
devastating blow to the development of competition" and would
"severely hamper" prospects for local competition.  Commission
lawyer David Lucero said AT&T didn't provide new information to
trigger reconsideration.  "AT&T used the appeal process to restate
a case it could not support with facts during the proceeding," said
Emily Harrison, USW spokeswoman in Casper.  USW set new flat rate
for residential service at $16.25 per month, compared with $12.64
monthly in rural areas and $14.64 monthly in towns with more than
24,300 lines, she said.  AT&T in petition said PSC had failed to
act on eliminating charges for carrier common lines that
competitors must buy from USW to provide toll service in state.

26.  "Ameritech's failure to negotiate in good faith demonstrates
how a local monopoly can block competition on the state level,"

MCImetro sought interconnection agreement in Cleveland, asking
Ameritech to defer economic terms of agreement to PUCO for
resolution.  MCImetro plans to install switch for local traffic by
April and offer service later this year.  "What makes Ameritech's
nonaction so galling is that it has already done in Wisconsin what
we are asking it to do here in Ohio," she said.

DELAY IN CIRCULATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT SUE TO DOLE.TEXT

      It appears that the House Republican leadership has delayed
circulation of the telecommunications conference report because of
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole's (R-Kan.) concerns.  Dole has
cited problems with a provision that he perceives as a multi-billion
dollar spectrum giveaway.  However, sources close to the negotiations
speculated last week that Dole's real concern may lie with the
conference committee's decision to strike language abolishing
rate-of-return regulation.
     SBC Communications Inc., which serves Dole's home state of
Kansas, particularly is concerned about striking that language, the
sources said, and could be the real reason for the delay.
     A spokesman for SBC denied the charge.  An alternate form of
price regulation is already in place in Kansas.
     John Schneidawind, a spokesman for the Alliance for Competitive
Communications (ACC), which represents the seven regional holding
companies (RHCs), called the allegations "bunk."
     Larry Clinton, associate vice president of government relations
for the U.S. Telephone Association (USTA), said that he was "99
percent confident that the Bells are together.  Do they want greater
pricing flexibility?  Sure.  Do they want to hold the bill up over
this?  I don't think so," he said.  

  ...Dole's Concerns

     But a Dec. 7 letter that Dole sent to House Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.) warning that any progress made on telecom legislation could be
"compromised" if telecom conferees "continue to consider regulatory
solutions that are clearly outside the scope of either bill" (WTN,
12/11/95,), seems to provide evidence that the majority leader is
harboring some serious concerns not associated with the spectrum
flexibility provisions. 
     "Whether it is moving backwards on regulation of phone rates,
expanding the House provision on facilities-based competition, or
weakening my forbearance provisions to get useless regulations, it is
all counter productive," Dole wrote.  
     A Dole spokesman said he could not comment beyond what the
majority leader said during a recent press conference, that, "there
are three, four, or five provisions including spectrum giveaway" that
are still of concern. 
     Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), ranking member of the House Commerce
Committee, told sister publication Communications Today that there are
"honest problems [with the conference report] that are more political
than substantive."  He said many members are "unhappy" with the
report.  However, he was unsure how many members were involved, how
unhappy they were, and whether they were unhappy enough not to sign a
conference report.

  ...How Can Spectrum Flexibility Be Resolved?

     The budget reconciliation agreement currently being negotiated on
Capitol Hill will be Dole's recourse to resolve the spectrum
flexibility issue, sources said.  A plan put forward by President
Clinton to speed up the transition to digital TV has been shot down by
budget negotiators, but Dole may try and push to auction off the
spectrum.  Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-S.D.)
floated a similar plan in the early stages of the budget
reconciliation process, but it received a hostile reception by the
broadcasters and was killed.       
     Neither speeding up the transition to digital TV nor auctioning
off the additional 6 MHz needed for the transition would be
acceptable, sources said.  By auctioning off the spectrum, Congress in
essence would be making a public policy decision that it did not want
digital TV, the sources added. 
     The budget reconciliation issue will need to be resolved before
the telecommunications conference agreement is brought to the floor,
several Hill sources said.  Also, until Dole's concerns are resolved,
the House leadership refuses to circulate the conference report for
signature.

SHUTDOWN CONTINUES TO DELAY FCC ACTIONS, BUT AUCTIONS CONTINUE

     The planned Jan. 18 FCC meeting is "imperilled if we do not go
back to work soon," FCC Chairman Reed Hundt told sister publication
Communications Today last week.  The first day the FCC is open after
the current federal budget impasse ends, Hundt plans to meet with the
other commissioners to see if there are issues they can agree to
address on that date or soon after.
     It usually takes three weeks to put a commission meeting
together, but commissioners could agree that there is something they
want to accomplish and schedule a meeting more quickly upon their
return, Hundt said. 
     Asked what FCC work is being delayed by the shutdown, Hundt noted
that not only are "thousands of complaints, petitions, and
applications...not being filed," many proceedings are not being
addressed.  Although actions opening proceedings on access charge
reform and advanced TV policies have been discussed as possible agenda
items for the Jan. 18 meeting, Hundt said that he does not set the
agenda items until three weeks before the meeting. 

  ...Shutdown Affects Workgroup Participation

     Michele Farquhar, chief of the Wireless Telecommunications
Bureau, who made a brief appearance with Hundt at last week's Hearing
Aid Compatibility and Access to Digital Wireless Telecommunications
Summit, said that neither she nor other FCC officials could
participate in the summit's workgroups because of the government
shutdown.  The only thing Farquhar has received is emergency federal
worker status to continue overseeing FCC auctions.  
     All three ongoing commission auctions started up again last week
after a holiday hiatus.  These include the C-block personal
communications service auctions and the smaller specialized mobile
radio service and multipoint distribution service auctions.
     But the shutdown still burdens many segments of the wireless
industry awaiting actions in non-auction matters.  Farquhar said that
the bureau typically receives 3,000 license applications a day.  These
applications cannot be filed because of the shutdown.  Hundt said that
the upcoming Jan. 24 auctions of two direct broadcast satellite
construction permits will not be affected by the shutdown.  He noted
that Congress and the administration realize it would be "unacceptably
foolish" when the impasse is over the budget deficit to keep the
agency from bringing in money to reduce that deficit.

HUNDT:  INDUSTRY SHOULD SOLVE HEARING AID PROBLEMS

     FCC Chairman Reed Hundt told a wireless industry and consumer
gathering last week that the commission does not plan to mandate
hearing-aid compatibility standards for the wireless telecom industry. 
But he indicated that the agency stands ready to bite down with its
regulatory "teeth" if the digital wireless communications industry
does not try to provide access to America's 28 million
hearing-impaired consumers.  Pulse tones created by some digital
wireless technologies are claimed to interfere with hearings devices
used by many people.
     Opening the two-day Hearing Aid Compatibility and Accessibility
to Digital Wireless Telecommunications Summit, Hundt expressed regret
that FCC staff could not participate because of the government
shutdown.  The summit--organized by the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association (CTIA), the Personal Communications Industry
Association (PCIA), the PCS 1900 Group, and consumer and manufacturing
interests--is bringing industry and consumer interests together to
discuss interference and compatibility problems for hearing-aid users
in the rapidly changing world of wireless technology. 

 ...Encouraging Compromises and Practical Solutions

     Hundt encouraged summit participants to find compromises and
practical solutions.  He noted that wireless industry leaders have
assured the FCC that they will work with hearing-impaired consumers to
address their concerns.  With many new wireless technologies coming to
market, the possibility of compatibility problems will continue to
arise, he noted.  
     Hundt also emphasized the need for the cooperative processes
created at the summit to continue.  These include "identifying
compatibility problems as soon as they are spotted" and "trying to
understand the technology and the problems" rather than engaging in
wars of rhetoric.
     He assured industry that the FCC is "not going to mandate
solutions" and "lock in the status quo."  But "we are not going to say
that the marketplace will resolve all compatibility problems."
     CTIA President and CEO Thomas Wheeler said that the Oklahoma
University Center for the Study of Electromagnetic Compatibility,
which CTIA helped organize, should release on Jan. 15 the first round
of human factor results from its research to quantify interference
problems and isolate their causes.  CTIA also is using American
Personal Communication's digital system to test "bystander
interference"--the ability of a digital wireless phone to affect the
hearing aid of a nearby person not using that phone.  The completion
of this project is now projected for Feb. 15.
     Wheeler noted that the CDMA Development Group last month
announced a technical standard that provides a hearing-aid wearer with
the capability to turn off the component of CDMA (code division
multiple access) technology claimed to be a source of interference. 
"We are confident that the work of the EMC Center, which includes all
digital technologies: CDMA, PCS-1900 [the American version of the
European global systems for mobile communications standard], TDMA
[time-division multiple access], and IDEN [integrated dispatch
enhanced network]--will be able to identify other such solutions for
use with all technologies," he said.   

  ...A Running Start Toward Accessible Communications Technology

     The American Academy of Audiologists expressed hope that "the
summit meeting will provide a `running start' toward making 21st
century communications technology accessible to all citizens.  The
meeting also will help to clarify the parameters for appropriate
regulation of wireless communications by the FCC."  
     PCIA President Jay Kitchen praised the summit for bringing the
various interests "together to work in concert in a proactive, open,
and cooperative fashion with all the right technical expertise and a
results-oriented process in place."

C-BLOCK AUCTION TOTAL PASSES $1.2 BILLION

     Bidders in the C-block auction rocketed the net bid total to
$1.21 billion in the first four rounds before bidding closed Dec. 21
for the holidays.  The bidding competition at this early stage has
been fierce compared with the A/B-block PCS auction, which took 13
rounds and a move to more stringent bidding requirements to break the
$1 billion mark.  The C-block auction for the 493 licenses was
scheduled to resume at our deadline.
     According to sister publication PCS Week, the top markets have
been the scene of the most furious activity.  For example, Washington,
D.C.-based DCR PCS Inc. placed a first round high bid of $11.3 million
for the Chicago basic trading area (BTA), only to have the lead taken
by GWI PCS Inc. in round two for $15.8 million.  PCS 2000 L.P. then
upped the ante to $61.4 million in round three.  Round four saw DCR
take another shot at the lucrative Chicago license with a bid of $70.3
million, or $8.59 per potential subscriber in the market.  Several
other markets, such as Miami and New York, have seen similar activity.
     High bids for round four included $203 million for New York by
PCS 2000; $112.5 million for Los Angeles by GWI; $53 million for
Philadelphia by NextWave Personal Communications Inc.; $48.75 million
for San Francisco by GWI; and $46.5 million for the Boston license by
PCS 2000.

  ...Bidders Still Adjusting to Complex Auction

     In spite of the auction's frenzied pace, both auction watchers
and participants say that it is too early to predict any outcomes. 
"It's always so hard to tell [in the beginning] because there are so
many changes," said Peter Nighswander, a PCS analyst at
Malarkey-Taylor Associates/Economic and Management Consultants
International Inc.  "Companies drop out [and] consolidate, so at the
end of [the auction, the environment] looks different than when it
started."
     Kevin Christiano, spokesman for NextWave and an analyst for
Washington-based Freedom Technologies Inc., said his company was not
reading too much into the results of the auction.  "Right now I think
there's a feeling-out process ... [because] the complexity is a lot
greater than the A/B-block auction," he said.  "To the extent that
companies are just trying to get acclimated to this new auction
environment and that there are many bidders that are not quite as
sophisticated, it's hard to read a lot from the first four rounds."
     Christiano noted, however, that the activity in the top markets
may cause them to close much sooner than the rest of the licenses. 
Bidders that were shut out of those licenses but still determined not
to come away empty-handed may use their money on secondary markets,
thus precipitously raising the prices for those licenses.  Some of
these companies may inherit the "winner's curse," Christiano said. 

  ...What Is PCS 2000?

     Certainly the biggest surprise of the first four rounds has been
the aggressive bidding strategy of PCS 2000, a Puerto Rico-based
partnership that has caught the attention of the PCS industry ever
since it deposited $50 million for the C-block auction.  As of round
four, PCS 2000 had placed net high bids totaling more than $442
million--$185 million more than its closest competitor, GWI.  PCS 2000
had an astonishing 124 high bids in that round, covering most of the
Eastern United States.  
     PCS 2000 is a unique arrangement of 1,641 equity partners
developed and managed by Unicom Corp., the major general partner and
25 percent owner.  "Unicom is a Puerto Rican corporation that was
incorporated for [the purpose of bidding in the auction] four years
ago," said Javier Lamoso, company president.
     According to Lamoso, the company raised money by selling "limited
partnership units" to wealthy families and individuals, investment
companies, small partnerships, trust funds and pension plans.  "[The
investors] are from all over the continental United States."  PCS
2000's Form 175 application noted that none of these partners owns
more than 3 percent of the company.
     Lamoso would not divulge PCS 2000's market plans because he did
not want to signal the partnership's true motives to other players. 
He explained that losers in the auction could claim in court that PCS
2000 implicitly colluded with other bidders by naming the markets it
wants, thus raising the value of those markets for other players.  "If
I tell you what our strategy is or what markets we are looking for,
I'm afraid of being accused of signaling because of the way the FCC
has interpreted the SEC's rules on this," Lamoso said.  "I want to
avoid any hint of implied collusion."

TELECOM BILL RATED ONE OF TOP SWEETHEART DEALS IN 1995

     The Center for Responsive Politics rated the telecommunications
reform effort as one of the 54 "special deals" where campaign
contributors succeeded in lobbying legislation on Capitol Hill.  In
Cashing In From A To Z, authors Nancy Watzman and James Youngclaus
cite the telecommunications bill as mostly an "inside deal" that was
fought out by industry players such as the large long-distance
carriers and the regional holding companies.  "The tone was set early
in the session when Republican members of the House Commerce Committee
held a series of private dinners with CEOs of major communications
companies," the report said.  
     The report also noted that the telecommunications industry poured
$2.7 million into the campaign coffers of House and Senate members
during the first half of this year.  Republicans received 75 percent
of that amount, according to the report.  Sen. Larry Pressler
(R-S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, received the most
money from the telecommunications industry:  $103,165 in Political
Action Committee (PAC) funds in the first six months of 1995.   Sen.
Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) received $37,000 in PAC funds.  
     On the House side, House Telecommunications and Finance
Subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields (R-Texas) received $97,000 in PAC
money from January through June of this year, according to the report.

AGENTS FIND SCANNER/EAVESDROPPER DISGUISED AS A CELLULAR PHONE

     A new threat to the mobile phone industry was uncovered in a
recent fraud bust.  Law enforcement agents found a scanner the size of
a business card portfolio used to capture electronic serial numbers
(ESNs) and mobile identification numbers (MINs).  When open, the
scanner measures approximately 11 inches high, 6 inches wide and 1.5
inches thick, said U.S. Secret Service spokesman William Whiteside.
     "Like the cellular side, the criminal side of the industry is
becoming more mobile and building smaller devices to facilitate their
criminal activities," said Tom McClure, Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association director-fraud management.
     Also uncovered in the bust was a device called a "Celltracker,"
which is perhaps more threatening than the pocket-size scanner.  This
device looks like a cellular phone, but can be used to eavesdrop on
other cellular phone conversations.  The device can capture ESNs/MINs
and functions as a "Lifetime" phone.  The Lifetime phone can store 99
ESNs/MINs, making it easy to avoid detection as a cloned phone.  Other
Lifetime phones without the scanner were confiscated in the bust as
well.  Their keypads are used to program ESNs/MINs.
     AT&T Wireless Services Inc. first notified law enforcement agents
after discovering an advertisement for the sale of illegal electronic
devices on the Internet.  For the first time, investigators used the
Internet to "wiretap" and monitor outgoing and incoming messages of
the crime ring's leaders, Bernhard Bowitz, his estranged wife, Rachel
Bowitz and Gregory Brooks.
     Some good news:  "We have come up with a solution," said McClure,
referring to authentication technology.  He said there are a
half-million authentication-capable handsets and tests are under way
in New York on authentication networks.
     While the authentication technology may prevent cloning fraud, it
does not eliminate the eavesdropping capability of the Celltracker. 
However, Cycomm Corp. introduced a service last week that could
prevent such criminal activity.  The PrivaCall Network service allows
customers in the United States or Canada to have calls scrambled to
prevent monitoring of their cellular calls.

  ...Extension Cloning Case Goes to Trial

     In a related item, the first fraud trial involving a man charged
with extension phone cloning is underway in Lexington, Ky.  Don Billy
Yates used equipment to program cellular phones with the same ESN/MIN
combinations, allowing his customers to have two phones for the price
of one.  For one time fee of $150 paid to Yates, customers would avoid
paying activation and monthly service charges for the second phone.
     In a motion to dismiss, Yates argued that federal law did not
prohibit his activities.  The judge disagreed, saying that Yates
defrauded cellular carriers by denying them the monthly service and
activation fees.
     "[The case] could be the most important [fraud] case the industry
has ever had," said CTIA's McClure.  "We have long advocated that
[extension cloning] is a violation."  A decision from the jury was
expected as we went to press.

IN CASE YOU MISED IT:

     * Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) decided to forgo a run for one
of Louisiana's Senate seats and will run for his 10th term in the
House.  According to the Associated Press, Tauzin--who recently
switched parties--said House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has vowed
to name him chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance
Subcommittee after the 1996 elections.  The subcommittee's current
chairman, Rep. Jack Fields (R-Texas), announced last month (WTN,
12/18/95,) that he is retiring to spend more time with his family. 
The subcommittee's vice chairman, Rep. Mike Oxley (R-Ohio), is next in
line for the job.  However, Oxley also chairs the Commerce, Trade and
Hazardous Waste Subcommittee.  

     * Seeking to provide multiLATA (local access and transport area)
personal communications service (PCS) in North Carolina, South
Carolina and Tennessee, BellSouth Corp. has requested a waiver of the
1982 AT&T antitrust consent decree.  In addition, BellSouth asked the
U.S. district court overseeing the decree to relieve it of equal
access obligations for PCS in this area.     BellSouth noted that AT&T
Wireless, currently the only other PCS licensee in the region, is
likely to offer PCS on an integrated (local and long-distance
service), non-equal access basis.  "That being the case, granting the
waiver would be pro-competitive," it said.

     * Robert Woods, commissioner of the General Services
Administration (GSA), will discuss the Post-FTS 2000 program Jan. 16
in McLean, Va., at an event sponsored by Capitol Telecommunications
Professionals (CTP).  The Post-FTS 2000 program is designed to provide
government agencies with flexible, responsive, and state-of-the-art
voice, data and video networks; a Request for Proposal will be issued
in the next few months.  (CTP, 301/564-1032.)

     * Labeling the request an "extraordinary exercise in chutzpah,"
AT&T opposed Bell Atlantic Corp. and Ameritech Corp.'s joint motion
for court action allowing their minority-owned affiliate Telecom Corp.
of New Zealand (TCNZ) to provide "full circuit" service on calls
between the United States and New Zealand.  The two companies last
month asked the decree court to modify the 1990 order that allowed
them to invest in TCNZ. They want permission to provide the United
States half of the call to a point terminating on the U.S. West Coast. 
AT&T said TCNZ imposes the high accounting rates that the two regional
holding companies claim have disadvantaged them against competitors.
     "The effect of the proposed modification would be to enable
TCNZ-Bell Atlantic-Ameritech to impose even greater costs on U.S.
carriers and illicitly to advantage TCNZ's own full-circuit service,"
AT&T said.  Bell Atlantic and Ameritech also have not shown that "they
have lost the ability and incentive to leverage exchange monopolies
into long-distance markets in the five years since the TCNZ waiver
order was entered."

     * AT&T has opposed four regional holding companies' (RHCs') "me
too" requests for extensions of any decree waiver granted to an
individual RHC.  AT&T said that some of the waiver orders the RHCs
seek to extend "were granted solely because of facts unique to the
single [RHC which] sought and obtained the order."  AT&T specifically
noted a Pacific Telesis Group [PAC] waiver that allowed it to acquire
a 10 percent interest in a trans-Pacific cable.  
     The waiver would not have been granted, AT&T contended, if the
proposal was to allow each of the seven RHCs to acquire separate 10
percent interests, such that together they would own a 70 percent
stake in the cable.  "Yet this motion would authorize precisely that,"
AT&T said.       

     * The American Mobile Telecommunications Association plans to
hold a series of seminars on how independent specialized mobile radio
(SMR) operators can develop winning strategies in the new 800 MHz
regulatory framework.  The association also plans to form a panel of
experts that will help resolve any disputes arising from relocation. 
(AMTA, 202/331-7773.)

     * The Alarm Industry Communications Committee (AICC) has asked
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to overturn Judge
Harold Greene's decision denying AICC's motion to intervene in
Ameritech Corp.'s [AIT] request for an expedited waiver (case no.
95-5439) to acquire an alarm services company within Ameritech's
region.  The court granted the waiver 
Sept. 8.

1996 SEEN AS THE CALM BEFORE THE COMPETITIVE STORM

     The outlook for the telecommunications industry in 1996 is 
one of uncertainty and caution.  Many executives, regulators and
legislators believe 1996 will be the year companies across all lines
of the telecommunications industry jockey for position to prepare for
a marketplace without competitive barriers.
     Uncertainty lingers, of course, because the fate of the telecom
reform bill still is uncertain.  If the bill passes, consumers are not
likely to see immediate changes.  Instead, players in all facets of
the industry are likely to take a deep breath to figure out the
consequences of the legislation before making any major moves. 
     In other words, 1996 will be the calm before the storm.  Bernard
Ebbers, CEO of interexchange carrier (IXC) WorldCom Inc., said the
state of competition in the telecommunications marketplace will change
very little in 1996.  Some changes may be noticed by the end of this
year, he said, but dramatic changes will not occur until 1997.
     "I think the legislation is irrelevant in 1996," Ebbers said. 
"If legislation is passed I think we'll see very little effect in
1996.  People will be getting ready, but I don't think we'll see much
of a roll out of anything this year."
     Roy Neel, president and CEO of the U.S. Telephone Association
(USTA),   said nothing will happen overnight once the legislation is
approved.  In some cases, the industry will have to look at how the
FCC implements the legislation.
     "You may get the bill passed tomorrow, but it may take six months
to write the rules to implement it," Neel said.

  ...Merger Mania?

     Some believe the landscape will become less crowded as companies
across all lines of the telecommunications industry begin merging and
allying.  The industry has been moving in that direction over the last
two years, with companies partnering to do everything from developing
interactive TV services to offering personal communications services
(PCS).   
     Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), a member of the House Commerce
Committee and its Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, said
the pace of consolidation will accelerate once a bill is passed. 
Boucher believes the industry could start to see national multimedia
companies develop this year that will provide a host of offerings such
as television and movie production and cable TV and telephone
services.
     "I think that will eventually occur as the lines that distinguish
telephone, cable and entertainment companies blur, and in the future,
vanish altogether," he said.  
     Pacific Telesis Group Vice President for Corporate Strategy Bob
Barada thinks legislation will force the telecommunications industry
down the same path as other large industries where only three or four
major players exist in a given market. 
     "That's probably going to happen in our industry when legislation
gets out of the way," said Barada.  "I don't think [the marketplace]
can sustain eight huge local exchange companies and four huge IXCs."  
     Others, however, do not subscribe to the shakeout theory that
Barada and others are espousing.  USTA's Neel said that predictions
that only a few companies will be left after the smoke clears are
"certainly premature and perhaps even nonsense."
     Two candidates often mentioned as merger partners are Bell
Atlantic Corp. and NYNEX Corp..  The two already are members of the
Tele-TV venture, were members of a consortium that bid in the PCS
auctions, and have merged their cellular operations.  
     George Schmidt, who now is president of Omnipoint Communications
Inc., worked with both companies when he was president and CEO of PCS
PrimeCo, the PCS alliance that also includes U S WEST Communications
[USW] and AirTouch Communications [ATI].  While NYNEX and Bell
Atlantic are a good fit geographically, they operate very differently
and their  respective chairmen--Ivan Seidenberg and Ray Smith--"make
strange bedfellows," Schmidt said, adding, "I don't know if Ivan, who
just became chairman of NYNEX, could stand being anything less than
that.  We know Ray can't, and he's not retiring."
     Another takeover candidate mentioned by many is MFS
Communications Co. Inc..  The competitive access provider's president,
Royce Holland, thinks such speculation is due to the fact that his
company is well positioned to take advantage of deregulation.  MFS, he
said, serves more office square footage with fiber than any other
company in the world.
     "We're not necessarily looking for alliances," Holland said. 
"[But] if something comes along that makes sense we'll take a hard
look at it."

  ...The Wireline Wars

     Regardless of whether the legislation passes, consumers in
several states will see competition in the local telephone market. 
Legislators and regulators in states like California and New York
already have cleared the way for competition in the local loop.   
     "We believe that 1996, especially in California, is the year of
the wireline wars," PacTel's Barada noted. 
     MFS's Holland said if 1995 was the year of co-carrier rules, 1996
will be the year of co-carrier implementation.  Holland's company has
either applied to or has been approved to provide local telephone
service in 17 states.
     "I think 1996 will see a big acceleration in competition in the
local loop," Holland said.  "We certainly saw a lot happen in '95 on
the state level...I think we'll see a lot of these regulatory
breakthroughs implemented."
     As competition heats up, the industry and regulators still will
struggle with issues such as interconnection and access policies, the
correct approach to universal service, protections for service quality
and number portability, said Lisa Rosenblum, deputy chairwoman of the
New York Public Service Commission.
     "Even if you get the basic policy established, there's a range of
areas that you're going to have to continue to monitor or modulate,"
Rosenblum said. 

  ...Local Telcos Under Assault

     As the local loop opens in states across the country, the
companies which have had a monopoly over local service will be thrust
into a competitive environment, in particular facing the aggressive
marketing and advertising of the three major long-distance carriers: 
AT&T, MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp..  
     To prepare for the onslaught, the seven regional holding
companies (RHCs), GTE Corp., and the nation's more than 1,000 other
local exchange carriers (LECs) need to be just as aggressive on the
marketing front as their soon-to-be competitors.  USTA's Neel said the
LECs need to capitalize on the fact that consumers give local
telephone companies high ratings for providing dependable, reliable
and high quality service.  To avoid the churn that is so prevalent in
the long-distance industry, the LECs need to hammer this point into
consumers' heads.
     "The key for LECs is to become more aggressive tooters of their
own horn, so to speak," Neel said.
     PacTel's Barada said the RHCs must move from being considered
order takers to being known as aggressive marketers.  The companies
also must show the business and residential markets that they are
serious about providing superior service.  Consumers, he said, will
find out this year that their local telephone companies are ready,
willing and able to serve their needs.
     "Starting in '96 you're going to see us really trying to find
what holds consumers together, and willing to pat their backs and give
them massages," he said.

STOCKS:  DESPITE DECEMBER's DOWNDRAFT, IT WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR

     A tumultuous year but one that, in the end, proved highly
rewarding from a financial standpoint --that is how many who follow
the wireless industry from Wall Street doubtless will remember 1995.  
     For the 12 months through Dec. 29, the North American
Telecommunications Index--composed of the stocks of 16 publicly held,
large-capitalization companies, all of which do business in cellular
and paging services or in manufacturing wireless equip-ment (WB&F,
Jan. 4, 1995)--increased 30.4 percent. Much of this gain came in the
second half of 1995.     Not all telecom indices followed this
pattern, however.  The 20-stock Chicago Board Options Ex-change Global
Telecommunications Index, up 22.5 percent on the year, was flat since
mid-July.

AUSTRIAN GSM LICENSE AWARDED FOR $400 MILLION

     Bowing to bidders' demands that a winner be named by year's end,
Austria's top telecom regulator announced Dec. 29 that a German-led
group will be licensed to operate the nation's first private cellular
system.  O-Call, led by Deutsche Telekom and Siemens AG with financial
backing from Austrian interests, is to begin service of the global
system for mobile communications (GSM) network in about six months. 
Austria's PTT, building out its own GSM service, is expected to pay
the same amount--$400 million--that Transportation Commissioner Viktor
Klima said O-Call offered for the 15-year license.

LATE-1995 SIGNPOSTS POINT WAY TOWARD INDUSTRY TRENDS OF 1996

Executive Summary:  From interviews with industry leaders and analysis
of recent events, it is possible to connect some of the dots and make
educated guesses about what 1996 holds in store for wireless.

     The way Larry Vanston sees it, the year ahead "will be a lot like
'95" in the world of wireless telecommunications.  This is to say that
1996 will be another year of record-setting growth, heightened
competition and rapid techno-logical change for the industry,
according to Vanston, president of Austin, Texas-based consultants
Technology Futures Inc.
     Vanston and other observers surveyed by WB&F said it may well be
that the industry is in for a year when the pace of developments, if
anything, gains more momentum.  Such an acceleration is seen occurring
across a broad front--mani-fested by prices for services driven lower
as more competitors arrive on the scene and by a stream of
technological advances--and against a backdrop where wireless
telephony becomes a widespread reality in more markets overseas.
     But this is not to say that there are no clouds on the wireless
horizon.  Indeed, renewed signs of a slowdown in the U.S. cellular
market--the world's largest, in terms of absolute subscribers--have
dampened the growth outlook for network operators and for handset and
infrastructure manufacturers. 
     As Nokia Corp. noted Dec. 14, "Despite improvement in Nokia's
U.S. mobile phone business, growth and profitability in Nokia Mobile
Phones have developed somewhat below plan."  That sent the price of
Nokia's American Depositary Receipts tumbling for the second time in
two months (page 9).  
     However, it was unclear at press time whether handset
manufacturers in general faced a repeat of the overages that built up
in their U.S. inventories during the 1994 Christmas season.
     All the same, Wall Streeters are a notoriously fickle bunch, and
any fall-off in domestic wireless growth should be measured against
the blistering ex-pansion that the U.S. market enjoyed during 1994 and
the first half of 1995.  Net subscriber additions simply could not be
sustained forever at such an ex-plosive rate, and cellular's long-term
growth pattern seems firmly intact. 
     By the end of 1996, it is conceivable that there will be 40
million cellu-lar subscribers in the United States--a gain of 10
million in a 15-month span.

  ...All Eyes Turn to PCS

     Big changes are destined to sweep the U.S. wireless market this
year, as the industry comes to grips with the probable enactment of
legislation aimed at deregulating telecommunications.  This would give
network operators "the statu-tory certainty they need to move forward
with big purchases of new equipment," said Matthew Flanagan, president
of the Telecommunications Industry Association, Arlington, Va.
     Moreover, the U.S. market is on the verge of entering a new phase
with the advent of broadband personal communications services (PCS). 
It may be another year yet before PCS is marketed on a large scale,
but PCS licensees are betting big bucks that both lower price points
and the digitally enhanced sound quality of calls placed over their
systems will prove appealing to consumers who have disdained cellular
as too costly and to at least some cellular subscribers.    
     This year's challenges for PCS players will be to finish the U.S.
licensing process--the C-block spectrum auction (see page 10) is set
to resume this week--and to bring newly licensed services to market,
said Tom Mateer, vice president of business development for Sprint
Telecommunications Venture (STV), the al-liance of Sprint Corp. and
three large cable television operators.
     "Our goal is to provide service in our own markets by the end of
1996," Mateer said of Kansas City-based STV, the largest of the A/B-
block major trading area (MTA) licensees in terms of potential market
population.  Other MTA licensees, including AT&T Wireless Services and
PCS PrimeCo L.P., are working against similar timetables.
     While committed to code division multiple access (CDMA) as its
technology
standard, STV had not named equipment vendors for its network
buildout--estimated to cost from $3 billion to $4 billion by industry
sources--at press time.  Mateer said talks with prospective suppliers
were "moving along."
     Some funds from Sprint's long-anticipated deal to sell 10 percent
equity interests to France Telecom and Germany's  Deutsche Telekom,
which was approved by the FCC last month, are expected to be earmarked
for STV's buildout.
     On the narrowband side of PCS, action will center on how
successfully competitors narrow the lead that Mobile Telecommunication
Technologies Corp. (Mtel) enjoys in this market.  For its part, Mtel
continues to grapple with what Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. recently called
"rollout concerns" surrounding the company's SkyTel 2-Way advanced
messaging service.  

  ...Competition, Consolidation and Convergence:  More of the Same,
Only More So

     Perhaps the most important issue before the wireless industry is
how to compete effectively on a landscape that seemingly keeps
shifting beneath its feet.  For many wireless players, achieving
"scale" is the way to maximize their competitive ability.  
     This consolidation trend has been most pronounced in paging,
where Arch Communications Group Inc. and AirTouch Paging announced the
most recent acquisitions, deals giving them about 2.5 million and 2.2
million U.S. subscribers, respectively.  Suf-fice it to say that more
paging acqui- sitions are in the offing this year.
     But 1996 will see the introduction of new wireless players as
well, via corporate spinoffs.  For instance,  Sprint's spinoff of its
Sprint Cellular subsidiary to shareholders (WB&F, June 21, 1995) is on
track for completion late next month or early in March, and AT&T
Corp.'s landmark breakup (WB&F, Sept. 27, 1995) is set to close by
year's end.
     Other wireless companies may become publicly held entities. 
PageMart Inc., the only privately held company among the top U.S.
paging operators, has hinted that it may go this route, and London
financial circles are abuzz that Hutchison Wampoa of Hong Kong will
float Orange, its U.K. personal communications network (PCN)--possibly
as part of a larger realignment of its telecom interests.
     And the cast of characters getting into wireless seems likely to
keep on growing.  Two recent examples: 

     *  A unit of International Family Entertainment Inc., whose
chairman is evangelist Pat Robertson, bought out the majority interest
held by Motorola Inc. in Pakistan Mobile Communications Ltd., licensed
to offer nationwide cellular service based on the global system for
mobile communications (GSM) standard as well as paging in the Asian
country.
     *  Fidelity Capital, part of the Boston-based mutual funds giant,
has helped engineer a deal aimed at strengthening specialized mobile
radio (SMR) operator Pittencrieff Communications Inc. in its core
Texas market (WB&F, May 10, 1995).  Pittencrieff shareholders were to
vote late this week on the company's merger with Fidelity-owned
Advanced MobileComm Inc.
     Meanwhile, convergence has continued to take on new and different
forms in wireless.  For instance, there is the growing trend among
competition-minded service providers to establish themselves as "one-
stop shops." 
     In the space of a week last month, Dallas-based Paging Network
Inc. (PageNet) announced marketing agreements with both STV and GTE
Corp., giving PageNet new distribution channels for its digital and
alphanumeric services in both the PCS and local telephone markets,
respectively.  
     STV, by packaging cable services on a promotional basis with its
planned service offerings for the local and long-distance telephone
markets, appears to be seeking as many distribution sources as
possible.  STV also signed an agree-ment covering various text-
messaging services with National Dispatch Center Inc., a San Diego-
based data network operator, last month. 

  ...Technology:  It's Show Time for CDMA, iDEN

     Technology, like competition, is a powerful catalyst for
convergence.  The wireless industry should look during 1996 for more
developments along the lines of these recent announcements:
     *  Putting aside their intense rivalry, Motorola granted L.M.
Ericsson AB a license to use Flex, Motorola's high-speed paging
protocol, in the Swedish company's pagers and infrastructure
equipment.
     *  IBM Corp., Nokia and the PCS subsidiary of Pacific Telesis
Group will work together on making wireless data services accessible
to subscribers via IBM ThinkPad laptop computers.  The ability to send
and receive e-mail and facsimile messages and to gain access to the
Internet will be a key selling point for Pacific Bell Mobile Services
in marketing PCS in its service area of California and Nevada, the
companies said.
     But in the dynamic field of wireless technology, the CDMA air
interface--and its promise of offering 10 times the capacity of analog
cel-lular--no doubt will command the limelight right through 1996.     
          The first CDMA system to achieve commercial status was
Hutchison Telecom's cellular service in Hong Kong last fall.  Next up
will be a long-awaited cellular network built out in Los Angeles by
AirTouch Com-munications, which has spent much time fine-tuning it,
followed by the
mid-1996 launch of Shinsegi Tele-communications Inc.'s cellular system
in South Korea (WB&F, Aug. 30, 1995).
     Importantly, the 43 member companies of the CDMA Development
Group have verified test results done with CDMA's 13 kilobits per
second vocoder, a touch-stone to achieving wireline-quality voice
communications over CDMA networks. 
     CDMA handsets for use on PCS networks are expected to become
available during the first half of 1996, said Kevin Kelley, vice
president of external affairs for Qualcomm Inc., San Diego.  The
company plans to ship 1 mil-lion terminals this year.
     For enhanced specialized mobile radio (ESMR) operator Nextel
Communica-tions Inc. [CALL], at least some of the questions
surrounding the sound quality of Motorola's ESMR technology, known as
iDEN (WB&F, April 12, 1995), will be resolved this year.  
     Even while cementing its nation-wide footprint in place with the
immi-nent completion of its acquisition of Dial Page Inc. [DPGE], the
Rutherford, N.J.-based company plans to conduct asingle-market beta
test of what Nextel executives call "reconfigured iDEN" before the end
of March.  Based on the re-sults, the company will decide whether to
proceed with a "more broad-scale com-mercial introduction" of the
technology, Nextel disclosed in a recent Securities and Exchange
Commission filing.
     Meanwhile, Geotek Communications Inc.--with a $25 million line of
credit provided by Hughes Electronics Corp. at its disposal to acquire
additional 900 MHz spectrum--will begin commercial operation of its
own SMR service in Philadelphia, its initial market, this month.
     Finally, two companies developing interference-reducing cellular
filters that use high-temperature superconducting materials are bound
to make news.  Illinois Superconductor Corp. is proceeding with
operational field trials, while Superconductor Technologies Inc.
announced the delivery of its second receiver filter subsystem for GSM
base stations last week.

  ...International:  Asia, Brazil Seen as Where the Action Will Be

     According to the Commerce Department's Office of
Telecommunications, Brazil and India (WB&F, Dec. 6, 1995) will merit
close scrutiny from the wireless industry this year as emerging
markets with the greatest untapped potential.
     Also, noted agency analyst Stephanie McCullough, cellular
competition will come to five countries for the first time:  South
Korea, Taiwan, Belgium, Poland and Ireland.  The Czech Republic will
choose operators for two digital net-works this spring, and PCN
services may take shape in more European nations (page 7).
     Three other Asian "tigers" also are likely to make waves in
cellular in 1996.
     In China, handset prices and user tariffs are projected to fall,
spelling further rapid subscriber growth.  Having recently awarded
Ericsson its third infrastructure contract in 12 months, Guangdong
Mobile Communications Corp. soon will qualify as one of the world's
biggest network operators, boasting subscriber capacity of ap-
proximately 1.2 million on its GSM network and more than 1.4 million
on its analog system.
     In Indonesia, the state-run PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia is con-
verting its revenue-sharing arrangements with private investors in the
nation's five fixed and mobile operators into joint ventures.  This
may open the door to more foreign capital, akin to the $800 million
and the $586 million that Nynex Corp.WB&F, Oct. 11, 1995) and Deutsche
Telekom paid, respectively, for equity stakes in Indonesia's two GSM
carriers last year.
     In terms of sheer numbers of participants--seven, with a combined
sub-scriber base projected by Lehman Brothers Asia Ltd. at 1 million
as of the end of 1995--Malaysia is one of the most competitive of the
major markets for voice-based wireless services in the world.  Celcom-
-the nation's dominant cellular operator (WB&F, Dec. 7, 1994) but
saddled with an analog-based system--faces a difficult task in
protecting its market position against several upstarts offering
higher-capacity GSM.

INTERCEL PREPARES TO LAUNCH OFFERINGS OF STOCK, NOTES

     InterCel Inc. anticipates spending $110 million this year to
build out personal communication service (PCS) networks in major
trading areas for which Powertel PCS Partners L.P. won licenses last
year, followed by an ad-ditional commitment of $150 million to be
spent in 1997.
     In its latest annual report, West Point, 
Ga.-based InterCel disclosed that it plans to make concurrent public
offerings of stock and notes during the first quarter of 1996. 
Approximate amounts raised from these offerings will be $115.5 million
and $150 million, respectively.
     The offerings are being undertaken in conjunction with the
cellular network operator's plans to acquire Powertel (WB&F, July 5,
1995), a privately held con-sortium in which InterCel already is a
major participant.  
     Cash interest on the notes will not be payable before 2001. 
InterCel also is negotiating a $20 million revolving credit facility.
     While noting that its cellular operations have achieved "positive
operating income," InterCel warned in the annual report that
management expects "signifi-cant operating losses beginning in 1996,"
reflecting the impact of PCS buildout and marketing costs.

CELLULAR OPERATOR CLOSES TWO-TRACK DEBT FINANCING

     Colombia's Communicacion Celular SA (Comcel) received net
proceeds of $145.5 million from a recently completed debt financing,
the company's first.
     The funds will be used to expand the company's network coverage
in its eastern Colombia service area, which includes the capital city
of Bogota and which has a potential market population of 15.8 million
people.
     Comcel, adding subscribers at the rate of 4,000 a month, had a
mid-December base of approximately 62,000.  The company is in the
process of upgrading its technology, with the time division multiple
access digital standard to be paired with its advanced mobile phone
system analog network.
     The financing, said majority owner Bell Canada International
Inc., had two components:  a $100 million syndicated Eurodollar senior
secured term loan due in the year 2001; and an oversubscribed $150
million private placement of 
high-yield senior deferred coupon bonds due 2003.  The bonds, which
will accrete at a 13.125 percent rate compounded semiannually until
November 2000 and begin paying cash interest in May 2001, are combined
with warrants that, if fully ex-ercised, would amount to a 2 percent
equity interest in Comcel. 
     Montreal-based Bell Canada International, a BCE Inc. subsidiary,
owns 51 percent of Comcel.  The rest is owned by Colombia's principal
telecom companies, wireline operator Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de
Santafe de Bogota and long-distance carrier Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones.

LACK OF HANDSETS SEEN IMPEDING DUAL-BAND GSM SERVICES  

     Cellular operators that employ global system for mobile
communications (GSM) technology in their networks should think long
and hard about pairing their services with GSM's higher-frequency
counterparts, DCS-1800 and PCS-1900.
     So says Toni Stadelmann, deputy managing director of mobile
services for Swiss Telecom, which has deployed a DCS-1800 personal
communi-cations network (PCN) in Geneva to go with its nationwide GSM
cellular network.  
     While its experience with PCN has been limited
--the Geneva system was rolled out to coincide with the Telecom '95
trade show and conference last October--the PTT plans to introduce
DCS-1800 service in Zurich and Basel next fall as a capacity-enhancing
supplement to 900 MHz cel-lular in these high-traffic markets,
Stadelmann told the PCS-1900 in North America conference in Washington
last month.
     In the long run, he said, the company hopes to reach roaming
agreements that would tie its PCN service together with Europe's GSM
cellular operators and countries that either have PCN already--the
United Kingdom, Germany and France--or are contemplating PCN rollouts,
including Sweden and Italy.
     But there is one sizable problem:  Wireless equipment
manufacturers need to speed up efforts to bring dual-band mobile
phones to market.  The subject of GSM/DCS-1800 handsets also came up
during another recent meeting in Washington.      "I don't know of any
vendor today committed to" developing these handsets, Malcolm Cowan,
general manager of the Richardson, Texas-based PCS business unit of
Northern Telecom Ltd., told the PCS Strategies conference. 
     If recent contract announcements are any indication, however,
Finland's Nokia Corp. may be the first to take the plunge. 
     The company has signed a two-year contract with Telia Mobitel,
the biggest GSM cellular network in Sweden, for the delivery of base
station subsystems that can be used either for a stand-alone DCS-1800
network or a seamless dual-band service.  The base stations are
designed to bolster capacity in areas with heavy calling traffic as
well as to improve indoor coverage.  

  ...Savings on Fixed and Operating Costs, More Flexibility in Setting
Rates

     Nokia's other recent GSM/DCS-1800 infrastructure deals were with
NordicTel Holdings of Sweden and Sonofon of Denmark.  It also was the
vendor for Swiss Telecom's DCS-1800 system.
     For Swiss Telecom--scheduled to face competition in PCN beginning
in 1998, when spectrum set aside for private operators will be opened
up--pairing GSM and DCS-1800 will afford cost advantages in the areas
of infrastructure, its trans-mission network and customer service and
billing, Stadelmann said.  
     According to an analysis in which the PTT assigned different
weightings to these cost areas, potential savings of 30 percent can be
had--12 percent on both transmission network and billing/customer
service expenses and another 6 percent on infrastructure costs.
     Moreover, in limiting its PCN coverage to urban areas, Stadelmann
said that Swiss Telecom has found that it can devise a rate structure
that offers greater appeal to the more price-conscious segment of the
wire-less voice market.
     By setting rates close to those of the wireline network, Swiss
Telecom hopes to induce customers to switch over to PCN from the fixed
network for the mobility it affords.  But that, of course, first would
require a more robust roaming capability.
     All Stadelmann could do last month was ask rhetorically:  "What
are the manufacturers ... doing?"  He would like to see action sooner
rather than later.

GLENAYRE, NEXUS TEAM UP TO SUPPORT SPREAD-SPECTRUM TECHNOLOGY

     Glenayre Technologies Inc. is considering plans to manufacture
re-ceivers incorporating technology developed by Nexus
Telecommunication Systems Ltd., which plans to market the technology
to paging operators aiming to address the "low end" of the two-way
messaging market.
     The companies announced an agreement last month to collaborate on
inte-grating Glenayre-made switches, controllers and base stations
with Nexus's reverse-channel receivers and two-way applications
platform.  
     The deal is noteworthy because Glenayre will provide protocol
information on the company's GL3000 advanced paging terminal that
would facilitate the operation of the two-way Nexus Network on
existing one-way paging systems.  
     Besides possibly making Nexus-based receivers itself, Glenayre
holds an option to buy them from Nexus as an original equipment
manufacturer.  In return, Nexus granted the Charlotte, N.C.-based
company the right to obtain a worldwide license on its return-channel
technology.

  ...U.S. Beta Test Draws Near 

     Essentially, the spread-spectrum Nexus technology (WB&F, Nov. 9,
1994) af-fords one-way paging carriers a low-speed return channel. 
Nexus Network uses the unlicensed 902-928 MHz band for the return
channel, which operates at 200 bits per second--far slower than ReFlex
or pACT, the narrowband personal commun-ications service (PCS)
protocols developed by Motorola Inc. and AT&T Wireless Systems,
respectively.
     Rani Cohen, senior vice president of Givatayim, Israel-based
Nexus, said that Nexus Network is geared toward service offerings
where speed is not critical--most notably, a confirmation or short-
messaging capability that would appeal to price-sensitive paging
subscribers.
     A beta test of Nexus Network involving American Paging Inc. and
several other U.S. carriers is scheduled for next month.  
Minneapolis-based American Paging holds five regional narrowband PCS
licenses. 
     Samsung, the South Korean conglomerate, is expected to begin
shipping
two-way paging units supporting Nexus Network by next summer.

MULTIPLE SPECTRUM AUCTIONS, AND MORE ON THE WAY

     At the FCC's Dec. 15 open meeting, Chairman Reed Hundt hailed the
prospect of simultaneous spectrum auctions as a "tremendous
accomplishment."  
     And with good reason.  While the specialized mobile radio (SMR)
auction that began a month ago generally has moved along at a more
sedate pace, the C-block auction of bandwidth for broadband personal
communications services (PCS) kicked off with a bang on Dec. 18:  Net
high bids for the 493 C-block licenses exceeded $1.2 billion by the
end of the fourth round.
     One hopeful, Puerto Rico-based PCS 2000 L.P., offered an
astronomical $327 million in net high bids for basic trading area
(BTA) licenses in the first round, skewing the bidding.  But the
hectic activity put to rest at least some doubts about whether the
long-delayed C-block auction would measure up to last year's PCS
auction of major trading area licenses.
     Meanwhile, SMR operators praised FCC plans to auction wide-area
licenses for 10 MHz in contiguous blocks of 20, 60 and 120 channels in
the 800 MHz band.  Also, two notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRMs)
will allot still more spectrum for use in wireless applications if
adopted as final rules by the FCC:
     *  One would open the 37-38.6 GHz band for point-to-point
microwave operations.  BTA licenses would be auctioned off--possibly
as soon as a year from now--with credits and installment plans
accorded to small businesses that wish to bid.  A provision would
permit the processing of pending license applications in the 38.6-40
GHz band. 
     *  The other NPRM would give hospitals access to vacant
television channels in the very and ultra high-frequency bands,
doubling in many regions the number of frequencies available for
remote patient monitoring.  Higher power levels also would be allowed
for medical telemetry devices.
(FCC, Tel.: 202/632-7000.)

NEW YEAR BEGINS WITH CDPD CARRIERS STILL FACING SEVERAL TASKS BEFORE
ESTABLISHING NATIONAL SERVICE

     As of Jan. 1, cellular digital packet data (CDPD) service was
available in 31 of the top 50 U.S. cellular markets and a number of
smaller markets as well.  WDN's conservative estimate is that
commercial CDPD service is available to approximately 85 million
people--a third of the U.S. population.
     Those figures fall below the midyear aims of the leading CDPD
carriers, which hoped to have as many as 40 of the 50 top markets
covered by the end of 1995.  Plans are in place to establish service
in most of the remaining 19 markets with a few exceptions, most
notably Los Angeles.  Much of the coming year also will be devoted to
filling in coverage in the many markets where CDPD does not match full
cellular coverage.
     A great deal of work remains before CDPD becomes a true national
service.  After the continued buildout, interconnection between
cellular markets becomes an increasingly important priority.  In the
six months since the first interconnection agreement was signed by
Ameritech Cellular Services and GTE Mobilnet, only one other
agreement, between GTE and Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile (BANM), has been
signed.
     "The fundamental nature of the agreements is simple, but when you
get into all of the elements, it ends up being time consuming as you
get both sets of lawyers in motion," said Mike Franklin, BANM direc-
tor-product management for wireless data.  Even for cellular lawyers
accustomed to working out more complicated roaming agreements, CDPD
has been more difficult than expected.
     "I think billing has been an issue.  A lot of companies are still
choosing their billing systems.  At the same time that they are trying
to interoperate, they haven't even determined what they are going to
use to share information," said Ellen Smith, business development
manager-wireless data service for SNET Mobility.
     A thornier problem has been caused by the complexities of the
1984 consent decree managing the breakup of AT&T.  U.S. District Judge
Harold Greene's April 1995 order allowing the cellular subsidiaries of
Bell regional holding companies (RHCs) to provide limited long-
distance service included a clause designed to aid national CDPD
service.
       The ruling allows RHC subsidiaries to provide CDPD between
markets without having to provide alternative long-distance options to
the consumer.  Carriers can buy long-distance service at bulk rates,
greatly reducing the cost of operation.  At the same time, however,
the judge ordered the carriers to file "compliance plans" with the
Justice Department before providing long-distance packet data.
     Carriers also must prove that a competitive access provider (CAP)
is operating in a market before the Justice Department will approve
interconnections in that market.  That process, which must be done
market by market, has been one of the most time-consuming
complications.  The three-week partial shut-down of the federal
government, which included Justice Department employees, did not help
matters.
     "We have certified [through Justice] that there are CAPs
operating in Connecticut and the New York metro market, which includes
northern New Jersey," Franklin said.  The carrier has been waiting for
months for approval in other markets.
     BANM and Ameritech are affected directly by the situation, but
non-RHCs, such as GTE and AT&T Wireless Services are affected
indirectly by the inability to provide national service that some of
their customers demand.
     "We are very anxious to put the nationwide network in place.  We
are focusing on carriers that have major markets that are of interest
to our customers," said Jeff Damir, director-product marketing and
management for AT&T's wireless data division.  "Chicago [an Ameritech
market] has been an important market for some time due to the fact
that American Airlines is one of our most important customers."
     Under the two interconnection agreements now in operation, actual
commercial roaming is limited.  It is available between GTE's markets
and BANM's markets cleared by the Justice Department.  Ameritech,
which interprets the ruling somewhat differently, has opened its
markets to GTE customers, but Ameritech customers cannot roam to GTE
markets, an Ameritech spokeswoman said.  Ameritech hopes to have its
compliance report approved by next month.
     There is some progress in the interconnection discussions,
however, and carriers are piecing their commercial markets into the
beginnings of a national service.

     "Over the next six months, significant progress will be made with
interconnection agreements and the coverage that will be available to
AT&T customers," Damir said.
     The opening of new markets appears to be increasing.  Over the
last three months of 1995, BANM established CDPD service in its last
major market, Boston, and began opening the service in some of its
smaller markets that border major metropolitan areas, such as
Frederick, Md., and Hunterdon, N.J.

establish interconnection with other carriers to provide its customers
with service stretching throughout the northeastern United States.
     Carriers' next priority after building and connecting networks
will be to do more to market the service.  "My Top 10 list [of
priorities] starts with, 'Get more customers on the network.'  Every
other objective is a subset of that," Franklin said.

1995 IS MARKED BY INCREMENTAL CHANGES; PREPARATION FOR
THE TIME WHEN WIRELESS DATA BECOMES POPULAR BUSINESS TOOL

     No single dramatic event or development sums up wireless data
development in 1995.  It was instead a year of slow changes in mobile
devices and software and steady rollout of new infrastructure.  It
left room for speculation of what might be, but a still unclear pic-
ture of how popular the technology ultimately will be.
     On the positive side, there appears to be greater confidence
among some packet data developers, including the Ardis packet radio
network (see page 8), that the potentially lucrative mobile
professional market may soon be within reach, as applications improve
and devices become more functional and lower priced.
     But there is a negative side as well.  National cellular digital
packet data (CDPD) service remains a project under construction and it
still may have considerable building left at the end of 1996.  Its
rival packet data carriers, Ardis and RAM Mobile Data, continue to
have a difficult time broadening their customer bases.
     The two packet radio networks combined served approximately
67,000 users at the beginning of 1995.  In spite of confident
predictions, packet data still is used by fewer than 100,000
customers.
     Perhaps the most dramatic developments in wireless data came from
the unlicensed system developers--wireless local area networks (LANs),
unlicensed personal communications services and, perhaps one day,
Apple Computer Inc.'s vision of a wireless "National Information
Infrastructure" (NII).
     Even if wide-area licensed data approaches never grow into a
market of millions, the promise of unlicensed systems ensures that a
considerable amount of data will travel over airwaves in the future.
     Following is a summary of the more impressive trends and news
stories covered by WDN over the past year--the stories that are likely
to have significance in the coming year.

  ...Circuit-Switched Data Solutions Are Made Practical

     Even as packet data networks struggled in the marketplace,
circuit-switched cellular slowly increased its subscriber base.  It is
difficult to differentiate circuit-switched voice and data traffic
over a network, but cellular carriers believe that their circuit-
switched data traffic is far heavier today than on any other wide-area
wireless data network.
     "I think in circuit-switched [in 1995] we did phenomenally.  I
think we put on more circuit-switched users than Ardis and RAM [new
customers] combined," said Sue Major, director-wireless data and
paging, Ameritech Cellular Services.
     Along with the obvious coverage advantages, circuit-switched data
popularity is advanced by a number of technical developments.  Modem
pools from 3Com Primary Access and AT&T Paradyne have been or are in
the process of being installed in major U.S. markets.  Not only do the
systems smooth the way for circuit-switched data communications, but
they provide gateways for intercommunication with other networks, such
as the circuit-switched/CDPD interface approved by the CDPD Forum last
summer.

WIDE AREA NETWORKS

     Many carriers, especially Ameritech, have had positive reactions
to the AirCommunicator, an integrated cellular voice/data
messaging/fax device developed by Air Communications Inc., Santa
Clara, Calif.  The communicator comes bundled with Air Communications'
"AirTrue" protocol, designed to simplify circuit-switched cellular
data transmission at 14.4 kilobits per second without having to route
through a modem pool.
     Ameritech signed a distribution agreement for the AirCommunicator
last fall.  The first shipments are expected to begin within weeks.

  ...SkyTel Launches First Two-Way Paging Service

     SkyTel Corp., a subsidiary of Mobile Telecommunication
Technologies Corp. (Mtel), became the first national narrowband
personal communications service (PCS) carrier, taking advantage of an
FCC pioneers preference license awarded to Mtel.  That gave SkyTel a
head start over companies that won narrowband PCS licenses at auction
in 1994.
     A wide variety of applications are possible over narrowband PCS
channels, including e-mail access, faxing, voice paging, point-of-sale
transactions and telemetry.  However, "short messaging will be the key
application," said SkyTel President Jai Bhagat during the Wireless
Apps '95 conference in October, just a few weeks after the SkyTel
service began operation.  
     SkyTel operates with Motorola Inc.'s ReFLEXion 50 two-way paging
platform.  By the time other national and regional narrowband PCS
operators are ready to come on line, there should be at least one
rival technology.  AT&T Wireless Services is working with Pacific
Communications Sciences Inc. (PCSI), San Diego, to develop personal
air communications technology (pACT), which, unlike ReFLEXion, will
operate with equal forward and return channels, allowing users to send
and receive longer messages.
     An Israeli-based company, Nexus Telecommunications Systems Ltd.,
is testing a technology that would allow conventional one-way paging
carriers to get a piece of the two-way market.  Forward short messages
are sent over the paging network.  Acknowledgments in the form of
short canned responses are returned over the unlicensed 902-928 MHz
band.  Test systems have been established in Chicago, Minneapolis and
Orlando, Fla.  A consumer market test is planned for early 1996.

  ...New Voice/Data Handsets Previewed

     PCSI says it will begin offering an integrated voice/CDPD device
by the second quarter of 1996.  The PCSI device and similar products
that are under development by other companies will form a whole new
category of communicators which PCSI calls "personal access links"
(PALs).  They will be multifunctional devices designed with a heavy
emphasis on the communications features.
     Early personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other handheld
computer devices have not been successful in the marketplace because
their communications functions did not work well, many industry
analysts have said.  PCSI says that a number of devices introduced in
the last year, such as Motorola Inc.'s Envoy and Marco PDAs and pagers
developed for narrowband PCS, already fall within the PAL definition.
     The data phone will resemble "Simon," a voice/circuit-switched
data/page communicator designed by IBM Corp. and marketed by BellSouth
Cellular, which fared poorly after its 1994 introduction.  The PCSI
phone will be significantly smaller, lighter and less costly
(approximately $600 compared to over $1,000 for Simon).  It also
potentially could perform more applications.
     Users, for example, could get the latest stock values using CDPD
or access a data base to view a simple chart on the phone's liquid
crystal display.  The phone will e-mail short CDPD messages and alert
the user when a longer message is waiting.  The phone connects to
laptop computers and can act as a regular circuit-switched/CDPD modem.

THE WIRELESS LAN INDUSTRY ORGANIZES

     The technology for data transmission over unlicensed bands at 915
MHz and 2.4 GHz improved in 1995.  A wide choice of frequency hopping
and direct sequence wireless local area networks (LANs) are available
and wireless bridges and routers were introduced for increasing out-
of-doors coverage.  New unlicensed data options at 1910-1920 MHz and
2390-2400 MHz soon will be available.
     But many potential customers do not know about the wireless
options.   System developers, recognizing the problem, have begun
discussing the formation of an industry group dedicated to promoting
wireless LANs.  Discussions began among several companies in the fall,
including 3Com Corp., IBM Wireless Communications, Proxim Inc. and
Solectek Corp.  However, the talks are still at an early stage and
formation of the group could take several more weeks, people near the
group said.
     At the same time, a group of five companies--Digital Equipment
Corp.; Perfsoft Inc.; Raytheon Co.; Telxon Corp., and Cushcraft Corp.
(antenna system manufacturer)--formed the Wireless LAN Research Lab on
the campus of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Worcester,
Mass.  The lab is planned as an ongoing project to refine data
communications over unlicensed bands, including performance testing,
benchmark development and development of new site planning techniques.
     The group is designing a wireless LAN test bed to conduct its
research. The test bed is being built with funds from a National
Science Foundation grant awarded to WPI's Center for Wireless
Information Network Studies.

  ...FCC Authorizes Equipment Sales for Unlicensed PCS

     Wireless campus-area voice systems now are available from a few
vendors, including Ericsson and Northern Telecom, for operation over
the newly opened unlicensed personal communications band.  All current
systems are operating over the 1920-1930 MHz isochronous PCS band. 
Later systems, expected to be FCC-approved and available by mid-1996,
will be integrated voice/data systems which will also operate over the
1910-1920 asynchronous band.
     The FCC cleared the way for the new systems last May by approving
a frequency coordination plan submitted by UTAM Inc. in summer 1994. 
UTAM has divided the United States, county by county, into areas that
immediately can begin unlicensed PCS operations (Zone 1) and areas
where operations can begin only after the incumbent microwave
licensees in or near 1910-1930 MHz relocate.  UTAM is collecting fees
on equipment sales in Zone 1 to apply to relocation expenses in Zone
2.
     It is expected to take several years to completely clear the band
for unlicensed PCS.  The process is likely to be hastened in many
areas by adjacent broadband PCS licensees that also are engaging in
microwave relocation talks.  UTAM will be benefitted by many of those
third-party relocations.  The group will, however, be required to
reimburse third parties for a share of the relocation costs.
     In comments on the FCC's proposed microwave relocation rules,
UTAM asked for flexibility in its repayment schedule.  Cost-sharing
should take effect after a third party assists in clearing all 1910-
1930 MHz microwave licensees in a county, UTAM said.  The obligation
also could begin once UTAM raises the Zone 1 maximum power level or
reclassifies a Zone 2 area to Zone 1.

  ...Apple and WINForum Propose New Unlicensed Services

     As early as this spring FCC could respond to petitions to
establish a new set of unlicensed data transmission services in
unlicensed 5 GHz frequencies.  Apple Computer Corp. of Cupertino,
Calif., proposed reallocating 300 MHz (5150-5300 MHz and 5725-5875
MHz) for an NII band--a wireless component to the types of services
being discussed by the federal government's NII Council.
     Apple suggested a short-range (6-9 miles), point-to-point
technology operating at high speeds of 24 megabits per second (Mbps)
to support applications not currently available over wireless data
networks.  Eventually, unlicensed terminals could be linked to form a
national communications service, Apple said, although the emphasis of
the petition was on community-wide communications.
     The FCC received a petition similar to Apple's from the Wireless
Information Networks Forum (WINForum), an organization of Washington-
based communications lawyers and engineers.  WINForum's "SUPERNet"
proposal is for use of 250 MHz (5100-5350 MHz) with less emphasis on
out-of-doors communications.
     Both Apple and WINForum propose compatibility with the European
HIPERLAN technology as a platform on which to build even more
sophisticated wireless capabilities.  Many European countries have set
aside 100 MHz (5150-5250 MHz) for HIPERLAN, which is designed for 24
Mbps operation in a campus-area environment.  However, a considerable
amount of development still is being done on the European system.  The
first commercial HIPERLAN deployments are not likely to occur in 1996.

IN BRIEF

     Digital Ocean, portable computer and personal digital assistant
(PDA) manufacturer, this week at the MacWorld 1996 conference in San
Francisco is introducing "Seahorse," a new line of rugged PDAs meant
for industrial wireless applications.  Seahorse devices, which are
based on the Newton OS 2.0 platform, are available in integrated CDPD
and 915 MHz wireless local area network versions.  The system also can
be configured for infrared communications, global system for mobile
communication links as well as global positioning service.  The
complete package sells for under $2,000.  Digital Ocean has scheduled
the CDPD version for the first deliveries which will be in mid-1996. 
(Digital Ocean, 913/888-3380.)

     Wireless Telecom Inc. (WTI), Aurora, Colo., says that it is able
to sell circuit-switched and CDPD data on a national basis after
signing new reseller contracts with several carriers last month. 
Companies needing the ability to integrate different circuit-switched
and packet data applications nationwide can now deal with one entity--
WTI--for all hardware, software and service needs.  New contracts with
Ameritech Cellular Services and GTE Mobilnet authorize WTI resellers
to offer CDPD and circuit-switched service from those carriers.  A
restructured contract with Bell Atlantic NYNEX Mobile adds a number of
markets, including Washington and Philadelphia, to an agreement that
already included New York and Boston.  Existing agreements with AT&T
Wireless Services and L.A. Cellular, a Southern California partnership
of AT&T and BellSouth Cellular Corp., complete WTI's national reach,
the company says.  (WTI, 303/338-4200.)

ARDIS BELIEVES CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT TO EXPAND APPEAL TO MOBILE
PROFESSIONALS

     E-mail software now is bundled and attractively packaged with
easy-to-use PC Cards.  The software itself is more user friendly. 
Devices designed for mobile e-mail links are coming down in price--
slowly.  The environment is right for a more aggressive appeal to
mobile professionals to try wireless data, executives at Motorola
Inc.'s Ardis packet radio service believe.
     "Ardis historically has loaded its network through the vertical
marketplace," said Dan Croft, Ardis senior vice president-marketing
operations.  The year-end 1995 subscriber total was about 50,000.  At
the highest, 10 percent percent of that figure is made up of mobile
professionals, Croft said.
     But he is encouraged about the chances of increasing that per-
centage through developments such as AirMobile, one of five e-mail
software applications supported by Ardis.  AirMobile allows Lotus
cc:Mail to run seamlessly over the wireless network.  "We don't ask
the user to relearn a software program, which we think is
significant," Croft said.
     Ardis last month simplified the pricing of its e-mail packages in
an effort to attract mobile professionals.  The four "DataPak" plans
based on kilobytes used per month (see chart) replace more complicated
packet-based pricing. Users
that exceed their basic kilobyte allotments will be charged 54 cents
per kilobyte in all plans.



                         ARDIS E-MAIL RATE PLANS
     DataPak 20     DataPak 150         DataPak 350    DataPak 750

******************************************************************



     The new rates apply to all five Ardis-supported e-mail applica-
tions, including AirMobile, RadioMail and Ardis's own PersonalMessag-
ing system.  Ardis plans to apply the same pricing to other future
mobile professional applications.
     Croft, who worked in the cellular industry during its early days,
sees similarities in wireless data today.  Cellular phones originally
were called cellular "radios," but carriers found it easier to market
them as "telephones."  "We're trying to achieve the same process [with
Ardis].  If you know how to use cc:Mail, you'll know how to use a
wireless link," he said.  (Ardis, 708/913-1215; http://www.ardis.com.)

RadioMail, ARDIS LOWER RATES FOR TWO-WAY MESSAGING

     RadioMail Corp. and ARDIS Co. (Advanced Radio Data Information
Service) announced that they have reduced the service fees for the
RadioMail wireless messaging service over ARDIS' wireless data
network.  The new rates went into effect Jan. 1 of this year.

     Mark Elderkin, RadioMail's director of marketing, said he
expects the new rates to help spur subscriber growth, which was
less than stellar in 1995 (WMR, Dec. 5, p. 2) but started to pick
up toward the end of the year.

     Users subscribing to RadioMail via the ARDIS network will be
charged $10 per month, plus usage fees of 5 cents per kilobyte (1
kilobyte equals 1,000 characters).  ARDIS also charges 54 cents for
each kilobyte above the amount allocated in the subscriber's plan,
but RadioMail said the typical subscription, including ARDIS Mobile
Office air-time rates, starts at about $30 per month.  ARDIS is a
reseller of RadioMail.

     The RadioMail service also is available on the RAM Mobile Data
Inc. wireless data network.  RadioMail buys capacity from RAM and
resells the RAM network service to customers, along with its
RadioMail messaging service.  Elderkin said his company is
negotiating with RAM to lower its access rates, but no change is
immediately forthcoming.  As a result, RadioMail via ARDIS
currently is a somewhat better deal for subscribers, though the
difference in cost is not terribly significant, he said.

     RadioMail charges $39 per month for 100,000 characters sent
over the RAM network, plus 16 cents for each block of 500
characters beyond 100,000.

     The messaging service is expected as well to be available over
several cellular digital packet data (CDPD) networks when cellular
carriers, such as Ameritech Cellular Services and GTE Mobilnet,
begin offering CDPD services in the first half of this year (WMR,
Dec. 5, p. 2).

Competitor Plans to Lower Rates

     RadioMail's primary competition is Wynd Communications Corp.,
a subsidiary of Calif.-based Call America Business Communications
Corp., which offers Internet access, integrated services digital
network (ISDN) service, toll-free 800-numbers and long distance
services (WMR, Feb. 14, p. 1).  The company's WyndMail offering,
which uses the RAM Mobile Data network to provide wireless e-mail
services bundled with paging, voice mail, text messaging, remote
local area network (LAN) mail access and other such services,
starts at a flat rate of $49 per month for 50 messages of 1,000
characters each, with a usage fee of 29 cents for each message
beyond 50.

     However, a Wynd Communications spokesman told WMR that Wynd,
too, is in the process of negotiating these rates with RAM Mobile
Data in an attempt to reduce charges associated with WyndMail, and
possibly to change the rate structure as well.

Wynd May Again Charge by Kilobytes

     Like RadioMail's current rate structure on the ARDIS network,
Wynd used to charge on the basis of kilobytes transmitted, but
recently switched to charging by characters.  However, according to
the spokesman, "a kilobyte plan is better for the customer,"
because it charges for aggregate data usage rather than for blocks

GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS FOR STOCKS IN WMR INDEX FOR 1995

     The good news is that 1995 turned out to be one of the best
years ever for stock price appreciation.  The bad news is that the
stocks of the wireless companies tracked by WMR seem to have peaked
in September, with the other major indices also showing signs of
fatigue.

     The 50 stocks that now make up the WMR Index (Telsoft Mobile
Data Inc. ceased trading a month ago) were down by about 2.2
percent in December - only their second monthly decline of the
year.  There were 20 advances, 28 declines and two stocks unchanged
during the final month of 1995.

     The closing prices for Dec. 29, 1995, and their comparisons to
Nov. 30, 1995, and Dec. 30, 1994, are listed in the index on p. 9. 
The same is done for the major stock indices in the chart below.

     The stocks suffered a bruising fourth quarter, posting a 5.1
percent decline over the period.  They did, however, gain 8.1
percent in the first quarter of 1995, followed by 15.7 percent in
the second quarter and 14.5 percent in the third quarter.  That
leaves them up by 30 percent for the year as a whole.

     The charts on pp. 8 and 10 indicate top gainers and decliners
for the past month and for the past year, while Tables 1-8 on p. 11
highlight the leaders and laggards within each of the four quarters
of 1995.

     As the line chart on p. 4 suggests, the WMR Index hit its peak
three months ago.  At the end of September, the WMR Index stood at
1805.  It ended the year at 1713.  Nevertheless, it began 1995 at
1261, which, after adjustments for stocks that entered and exited
during the period, indicates there was a 30 percent gain for the
year as a whole.

     During the same yearlong period, the Dow Jones Industrial
average was up 33 percent.  The Standard & Poor's 500 was up 34
percent in 1995, and the NASDAQ Composite grew by 40 percent.

     Compared to two years ago, the Dow actually is up by the
highest percentage of the four indices.  Since the final trading
day of 1993, the Dow is up 36 percent, while the NASDAQ is up 35
percent, the WMR Index is up 33 percent and the S&P 500 is up 32
percent.

     The Dow closed 1995 at a level of 5117.1.  The NASDAQ ended
the year at 1052.1, and the S&P 500 finished at 615.9.  They began
the year, respectively, at 3834.4, 752.0 and 459.3, and each
continuously set new records toward the end of the year.

     As the data in the line chart on p. 4 illustrate, the WMR
Index and the three major indices dipped in mid-1994, recovered by
the end of the year and spent most of 1995 on a steady decline. 
Taking the levels of each in December 1993 as a base point, their
courses through the past two years show how each fared month to
month.

     Interestingly, each registered two monthly declines in 1995
and 10 advances.  For the Dow 30 and the S&P 500, the declines came
in August and October.  For the NASDAQ and the WMR Index, the
declines came in October and December.

     Over the past two years, the biggest monthly gain for the WMR
Index (+9.4 percent) came in July 1995.  The biggest monthly
decline came in March 1994, when it fell 6.0 percent.  That also
was the worst month of the past 24 for the three major stock
indices.  Meanwhile, the Dow's and S&P 500's best month was
November 1995, while the NASDAQ's biggest percentage gain came in
June 1995.

Showings in December

     Only three stocks were up by more than 10 percent during
December.  Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd. topped the gainer
list with a 16.5 percent advance, closing the year at $37, just
fractions of a point below its new high.  The stock, which began
trading in February at about $15, fell as low as $11.50 before
staging a comeback in November.

     Sony Corp., another company whose stock suffered through the
early and middle months of 1995, also closed 1995 on a high note. 
It closed December at $61.38 a share, up $7.50 a share from a month
before, but up only $5.25 from a year ago.  Still, it was one of
the Top 10 gainers in December.  BellSouth Corp., which also set
new highs at the end of 1995, was up $4.63 for the month and up
$16.44 a share for the year.

     There were an unlucky 13 stocks down by more than 10 percent
during the month.  They include the 10 listed in the chart on p. 8,
plus Vanguard Cellular Systems Inc., Racotek Inc., and Grupo
Iusacell SA de CV.  The biggest decline was Cirrus Logic Inc.,
which fell $9.25 during the month and $2.75 for the year.  The
company simply fell out of bed in the past few months, declining
from a high of $61.13 a share to a low of $11.13, before recovering
to $19.75 by year's end.  In the fourth quarter, the stock declined
65.5 percent, edging out Retix and Nokia Corp. for that dubious
distinction.

     Nokia, meanwhile, closed the year at $39 a share, up $1.50
from a year ago but more than $30 below its recent highs of the
summer months.  It announced some sluggish results for its cellular
telephone operations and the market drove the stock down.  This is
a company that continuously has led the monthly gainers lists.  In
fact, it's still more than triple its price of December 1993.  But
it's up only 4 percent for 1995, after adjusting for a stock split.

     Another former high flyer, wireless modem maker U.S. Robotics
Inc., also has turned on the fasten-seat belt sign.  It's down
$22.50 a share in December, which sounds bad until one realizes
they were up $17.50 in November and $7.25 in October.  So it's
really trading at its September price, give or take a few dollars. 
And it remains the top performer for the year, having quadrupled
since the end of 1994.

     Other top gainers for the year include Bolt Beranek and Newman
Inc. (BBN), Microcom Inc. and Pronet Inc.  Each has more than
doubled in price during the past year, although Pronet fell $1.25
a share during the final month of the year.

8 CDPD Carriers Outperform Market

     Eight wireless data and/or cellular digital packet data (CDPD)
carriers outperformed the market as a whole, meaning their stocks
appreciated by more than the 30 percent to 34 percent of the
general indices.  The top-performing carrier was BellSouth, up
$16.44 a share or 60.7 percent, followed by NYNEX Corp., Ameritech
Corp., GTE Corp., Sprint Corp., MCI Communications Corp.,
Southwestern Bell (SBC Communications Inc.) and Bell Atlantic Corp.

     There were nine companies down by more than 10 percent for the
year.  In fact, there were 13 decliners and 37 advancers for the
year as a whole.  The big losers for the year were Retix and Grupo
Iusacell.  Grupo Iusacell can at least blame the Mexican economy
and the run on the peso for its woes.  But Retix is in its 23rd
month of decline, falling from a price of $10.38 in January 1994. 
It closed 1995 at $2.13 a share, down $1.88 for the year and 6
cents for the month.

     Tables 1-8 on the facing page highlight the top gainers and
decliners in each of the quarters of 1995.  Interestingly, only 14
companies scored advances in every quarter, and nine of them are
cellular or wireless data carriers - some of the same names that
topped the list in the chart above.

Perfect Quarterly Scores

     The companies with perfect quarterly scores are Ameritech;
Bell Atlantic; BellSouth; BBN; GTE; Hewlett-Packard Co.; MCI;
NYNEX; Pronet; Rockwell International Corp.; SBC; Southern New
England Telecommunications Inc. (SNET); Sprint; and U.S. Robotics. 
However, only BBN and U.S. Robotics were consistently above average
for each of the four quarters.

     Average growth in the first quarter was 8.1 percent.  In the
second quarter, stock price growth averaged 15.7 percent.  In the
third quarter, prices were up 14.5 percent.  And in the final
quarter, the average share price decline was 5.1 percent.

     Racotek nearly doubled its price in the first quarter.  Cirrus
Logic was a top performer during the first and second quarters. 
Globalstar took the top spot in the third and fourth quarters. 
U.S. Robotics was second or third for the first three quarters,
though it fell out of the Top 10 (to 18th place) in the final
quarter.

     No company suffered four quarterly declines in 1995, but three
stocks were down for three out of the four.  They were:  AllTel
Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Samsung Ltd.  In addition, American
Paging Inc. and Nextel Communications Inc. suffered two quarterly
declines plus one quarter in which their stock price was unchanged.

     Besides the aforementioned hammering that Cirrus Logic took in
the fourth quarter, Intelligent Electronics Inc.'s 37.6 percent
decline in the third quarter and Iusacell's 36.2 percent decline in
the first quarter are the biggest quarterly declines of the year.

     During the first three quarters of the year past, there were
three or four stocks in period that were down by more than 10
percent.  In fact, in two quarters, only eight stocks declined at
all, making a Top 10 Decliner list impossible, as Tables 4 and 6
prove.

     In the fourth quarter, however, there were only 22 gainers and
28 decliners.  Of those, 21 declined by more than 10 percent.  Only
the Top 10 are listed in Table 8.

     Among the decliners of the fourth quarter, one common theme
emerges.  Investors began to reassess the outlook for cutting-edge
companies and their respective technologies, trimming back their
expectations for companies such as Mobile Telecommunication
Technologies Corp. (Mtel) and General Magic Inc., which are leading
the two-way paging and personal communicator markets, respectively.

     But as the market proved earlier in 1995, it also can reward
companies such as Globalstar and Metricom Inc., whose prospects for
cutting-edge wireless data ventures at one time seemed
questionable.  And as millions of widows and orphans know, the
safest bet in the telecommunications market continues to be Ma Bell
and her offspring.

ARCH TO ACQUIRE WESTLINK FOR $210 MILLION IN CASH

     Arch Communications Group Inc. has signed a definitive
agreement to acquire Westlink Holdings Inc. for $210 million in
cash and the assumption of $130 million in Westlink debt.  The deal
will make Arch the third-largest paging carrier in the United
States, with more than 2.5 million subscribers.  Arch will finance
the acquisition through an existing credit line and additional
loans.

     As a privately held company, Westlink was formed in 1994 to
acquire the paging assets of U S WEST Paging Inc.  The company
operates paging systems in a 14-state region west of the
Mississippi, while most of Arch's paging assets are concentrated
east of the Mississippi.  According to C.E. Baker Jr., Arch's
chairman and chief executive officer, the acquisition "will
effectively complete the geographic footprint that makes us a
national player."

     Arch, based in Westborough, Mass., also will gain access to
other paging licenses through Westlink's 49.9 percent stake in
Benbow PCS Ventures Inc., the winner of two regional narrowband
personal communications service (PCS) licenses sold at a Federal
Communications Commission auction last year.  Arch currently owns
about 11 percent of PCS Development Corp., a Greenville, S.C.,
company that won five regional narrowband PCS licenses at the same
auction, and plans to resell that company's two-way paging services
when commercial operations are launched in 1997.

     Arch can be reached at (508) 898-0962.

APC, MARYLAND AGENCY FACE PCS INTERFERENCE PROBLEMS

     American Personal Communications (APC) has rejected claims
that its personal communications service (PCS) system is
interfering with the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system. 
In a recent letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration
(MTA) stated that the new wireless service has caused "serious
interference" to the communications operations of light rail and
bus services operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations.

     The letter was made public by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing
incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz
(GHz) spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it
had distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.

     Anne Schelle, APC's vice president of external affairs,
expressed concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to
"politicize" the effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to
other spectrum bands.  The relocation of incumbent operators has
been a contentious issue since the Federal Communications
Commission first drafted rules requiring 2 GHz licensees to clear
that band to make way for new PCS licensees.  The commission
recently clarified rules adopted in the Engineering and Technology
Docket 92-9 "emerging technologies" proceeding, further defining
"good faith" negotiations over relocation issues between licensees
(WMR, Oct. 24, p. 6).

Interruptions a 'Grave Threat'

     The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions last
fall upon which APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transit
communications systems.  "These communications interruptions have
posed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27, 1995, letter
stated.  The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs
incurred as a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman
Anthony Brown declined to comment further on the interference
problems, noting that it involves "a possible issue of litigation."

     Schelle told WMR that interference problems with the mass
transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to the MTA,
an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have reported no
public-safety problems resulting from interference between the two
radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a responsibility to
respond to frequency coordination notices in a timely manner, the
attorney added.

     The MTA received at least six such letters indicating that APC
planned to test its PCS system, he said, but MTA officials failed
to respond to a single one.

     "Microwave licensees that ignore frequency coordination
notices do so at their own peril," the APC attorney stated.  "PCS
licensees can only protect licensed facilities if they are informed
of the complete parameters of those facilities' operations.  APC
fully protected the facilities represented on MTA's FCC license and
could not have known, without being informed by MTA, that MTA is
operating at a variance from those parameters."

COURT SHOULD CONSIDER Mtel LICENSE SEPARATELY, FCC SAYS

     The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has told the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Washington that it should not consider the
commission's licensing scheme for private paging licensees in its
deliberations on whether Mobile Telecommunication Technologies
Corp. (Mtel) should pay for a license obtained through the agency's
"pioneer's preference" program.

     Last month the court heard oral arguments in case no. 94-1552,
Mtel v. FCC, in which Mtel challenged the commission's authority to
charge a $33 million fee for the company's narrowband personal
communications services (PCS) license without first receiving
congressional authority (WMR, Dec. 10, p. 5).

     During the hearing, Mtel attorneys argued that the company
should not have to pay for its two-way paging license because the
FCC has granted free licenses to other paging companies that will
compete with Mtel.  The court had requested supporting
documentation, which Mtel supplied.  In its response to Mtel's
"post-argument submission," the FCC argued that private paging
licenses are not comparable to Mtel's license.

'Others Paid Substantially at Auction'

     "Mtel is a licensee in a brand new service (narrowband PCS) in
a newly allocated frequency band," the agency explained, adding
that all other licensees planning to offer narrowband PCS have paid
substantial sums for their licenses at a government auction.

     The FCC noted that it was Mtel's choice to develop an advanced
two-way paging system.  "To the best of our knowledge, Mtel did not
apply for a private paging license at 929-930 [megahertz]," it
said.  Furthermore, "Mtel's choice to commit substantial amounts of
money to its narrowband PCS licenses when private paging licenses
were 'free' undercuts its assertion in this court that the
commission is applying different rules to identical licenses," the
agency added.

MobileComm PROVIDING NATIONWIDE SINGLE-FREQUENCY PAGING

     MobileMedia Corp. has completed its previously announced
acquisition of BellSouth Corp.'s paging subsidiary, MobileComm, and
its narrowband personal communications services (PCS) licenses for
$930 million (WMR, Sept. 25, p. 6).  The combination of the two
companies gives MobileMedia a total of more than 4 million paging
units in service, making it the second-largest paging services
provider in the United States, the companies announced Jan. 4.

     With the completion of the largest acquisition in the history
of the paging industry behind it, MobileMedia will begin to market
all of its paging and messaging services under the MobileComm
brand.

All to Single Frequency During 2nd Quarter

     All MobileComm services are slated to begin using a single
frequency within the wireless spectrum sometime during the second
quarter of this year.  The frequency is in the 900 megahertz PCS
band for which MobileComm owns licenses nationwide.

     "This [will be] a significant benefit for our retailers and
the consumer," said Bill Stark, MobileComm's executive director of
retail distribution.  "By offering the one frequency, multicity
retail chains will be able to reduce the number of SKUs
[stock-keeping units] stocked in their warehouses while providing
a wider range of services....

     "Paging subscribers will also benefit from the move to single
frequency," he added.  "With the new single-frequency pagers,
consumers enhance their paging service without having the hassle
and expense of changing their pager."  When the single-frequency
offering is launched, all MobileComm pagers will operate in all
cities covered by MobileMedia's nationwide wireless network.

     MobileMedia is headquartered in Ridgefield Park, N.J., and can
be reached at (201) 462-4965.

PageNet OPENS NATIONAL ACCOUNTS DIVISION

     The largest paging company in the world has announced plans to
target the consumer market with a major new marketing and
distribution strategy.  Paging Network Inc. (PageNet) formed a
National Accounts Division that will work with large regional or
national companies to offer paging services as part of a package of
other consumer services, such as long distance or local telephone,
or cable television.

     Michael DiMarco, formerly PageNet's vice president of
corporate development, now senior vice president of operations for
the National Accounts Division, said he expects the division will
have a "dramatic impact on PageNet's growth and expansion into new
markets, particularly among consumers."

     The company currently has a substantial reseller channel,
established in 1992, that includes more than 6,000 businesses that
purchase air time and pagers from PageNet and resell them mostly to
business users.  The National Accounts Division, however, will
establish a different kind of relationship with its partners:  It
will provide customized, turnkey paging programs - including pager
leasing, customer service, order fulfillment and billing, in
addition to paging service - that the affiliate can offer to
customers as a bonus in an attempt to increase sales.

     MCI Communications Corp. began marketing PageNet's services
with its Friends & Family Connections program in early 1995.  The
success of that program led to the development of the new marketing
and distribution strategy, which was announced Jan. 4.  GTE Corp.
and the Sprint Telecommunications Venture became affiliates of the
program in December.  The National Accounts Division plans to
target other telecommunications carriers, as well as banks, cable
television providers, utilities, retailers and other companies, for
participation in the new program.

     PageNet, whose National Accounts Division is based in the
Dallas area, can be reached at (214) 985-6791.

STORM PROMPTS DELAY OF AUCTIONS UNTIL JAN. 16

     Citing poor East Coast weather, Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) officials decided Jan. 10 to postpone three
auctions of radio spectrum licenses until Jan. 16.  An FCC
spokesman told WMR that auction participants - bidding
electronically from Boston, New York and Philadelphia - were socked
in by the same blizzard that shut down the federal government for
four of the five business days last week.

     "In fairness to the bidders, the commission decided not to
restart the auctions until next week," the spokesman said last
week.  A number of bidders told the FCC that staff resources have
been limited by the winter storm that hit major cities along the
East Coast early last week, the spokesman said.

     A public notice regarding the delay was posted on the Internet
Jan. 10 and sent to auction participants Friday.

CABLE INDUSTRY NETWORK COMPETENCY CENTER CREATED

With the announcement of the Cable Industry Network Competency
Center, Digital Equipment Corporation has positioned itself to
become a driving force in the high-speed data communications
network industry. The Cable Industry Center offers network
consulting, integration, and management services to cable and
telecommunications companies around the world that are adding
high-speed data communications and Internet access to their
existing hybrid fiber/coax networks.

The Cable Industry Center, located in Littleton,
Massachusetts, is a logical outgrowth of the unique technical
and market experience Digital has gained over the past three
years. During that time, 60 high-speed data networks for cable
operators worldwide were installed to provide services to
local governments, schools and colleges, manufacturers,
healthcare institutions and telecommuters.

"We found that customers require both products and multivendor
integration services," said Larry Walker, vice president and
general manager of the Network Product Business Unit,
"therefore we have moved the Cable Industry Center from the
Network Product Business Unit to Digital's Network Services
group where its vast resources can be leveraged."

Graeme Shorter, vice president, Digital Network Services said:
"with this team of individuals we now have the experience,
skills, and knowledge to play a critical role as a partner in
the design, development, and deployment of complex, high-speed
data communications networks in the cable industry. This
market focus is an ideal complement to our existing network
business."

These networks provide users with high-speed access to the
"Information Superhighway," including Internet and on-line
services, as well as the ability to work at home, using
network connections that are 1,000 times faster than
conventional telephone modems.

In one of the initial projects for the Center, Digital
Equipment Corporation, MCI and Colorado Springs Cablevision
collaborated on a successful trial of the nation's first large
scale advanced telecommuting pilot during this past summer.
The Cable Industry Center is also currently working with
several other industry leading cable companies on their plans
to deploy new services.

Center Meets Urgent Need for Timely Network Implementation

Digital has created the Center at a crucial time in the
development of the high-speed data communications market. Many
service providers are now ready to move from the trial phase
to investment in full-scale full-service networks.

At the same time, changes in the regulatory environment are
opening up competition between telecommunications and cable
companies. Through the efforts of the IEEE 802.14 Committee,
the standardization and interoperability of technology for
multiple services over hybrid fiber/coax is fast approaching,
which will meet the needs of the cable industry.

"Multiple Systems Operators feel a great sense of urgency to
deploy networks," said Art Zins, managing director of the
Cable Industry Network Competency Center. "However, they worry
about making short-sighted decisions now that will preclude
other choices later. Our technical and business services can
help our customers implement flexible, modular, and economical
networks that meet their strategic business needs now and in
the future."

Leveraging Network Services and Multivendor Capabilities

The Cable Industry Network Competency Center staff bring with
them the skill and knowledge that was gained through
introducing and deploying Digital's ChannelWorks products
enabling high-speed data transmission over the existing cable
infrastructure.

As part of Network Services, the Cable Industry Center can
meet its customers' needs with cable data solutions that
employ products from multiple vendors. The Cable Industry
Center is establishing alliances with targeted cable modem
manufacturers and will continue to partner with cable
operators and systems integrators, as appropriate, to provide
the best-in-class solution. In addition, the Cable Industry
Center will be able to leverage the expertise of Network
Services' 1,300 network professionals and 40 Network Centers.
Network Services is part of Digital's Multivendor Customer
Services Division.

TECHNO-THEFT IS COSTING MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS MILLIONS

A dozen well-dressed men walk calmly into the front lobby of a
large corporation. Noting the visitors, corporate attire,
employees figure these are legitimate businessmen on their way
to a company meeting. They couldn't be more wrong. Surprising
everyone, the suit and tie executives suddenly pull out
automatic weapons and order employees to lie on the floor. In
a few terrifying minutes, they pillage the company's
computers, remove valuable memory chips and flee with
components having an estimated value of $5 to $12 million!

This latest chapter in an ongoing story of international
intrigue is not a scene from a James Bond movie. California
and is merely a small part of the disturbing trend of rising
computer theft and other "Techno-Crime."

In California's Silicon Valley alone, it is estimated that $1
million in components are lost to Techno-Thievery each week.
Worldwide, overall costs to electronics and insurance firms
are approaching a staggering $8 billion a year and are
expected to soar to $200 billion by the year 2000, according
to the Technology Theft Prevention Foundation in Clinton, New
Jersey.

The Foundation was started by insurance companies who, after
paying out millions in computer theft claims, wanted to
develop ways to curtail the rising Techno-Crime Wave.

According to FBI and other law enforcement agencies who are
working with the Foundation, Techno-Crime can come in many
forms that may or may not be considered thievery. But as far
as theft is concerned, although everything from motherboards
to modems and disk drives are targeted by Techno-Thieves, CPUs
(Central Processing Units) and SIMs (Single In-Line Memory
Modules) represent the crown jewels of computer theft.

"Basically, these parts are non-traceable, said Keith Lowry,
sergeant for the San Jose Police Department. "They are very
liquid just like gold, and the market for resale is fantastic
because there aren't enough products to go around;

It's big business and it's opportunistic," Lowry noted.
Manufacturers and consumers alike are being short changed
because Techno-Crime is having a substantial effect on the
quality of available memory products on both the wholesale and
retail markets.

Although electronic and computer buyers believe they are
getting a good deal, they are frequently getting ripped-off.
And the Techno-Crime Crime itself is sometimes not an obvious
one, such as that mentioned in the beginning of this story;
often the crime is difficult to identify and the price paid
can't be quantified--but consumers are paying the price. For
example, consumers are often attracted to flashy packaging,
which shows a product in its best light. Upon closer
inspection, however, the product within may not live up to the
advance billing given on the box. It is not uncommon for the
module inside not to have been manufactured or assembled by
the company shown. It is important that the consumer knows who
the real manufacturer of the product is and that it is a
reputable company--one that is respected throughout the
industry, no t just at the store on the corner.

"Everybody and their brother is slapping together cheap little
memory products," explained Jim Wong, president of Micro
Solutions, Inc., in Corvallis, Ore., designer of systems for
highly demanding users with specialized applications. "You
have to be very careful about who you buy from and what you
buy." cautioned Wong. "I've heard horror stories from people
who haven't been, but are now our customers because they can
constantly rely upon the quality we provide," Wong said.

With SIMMs comprising up to 50% of a computer system's cost,
and providing much of the computing power, the quality of
memory has become paramount, which has been a boon to
manufacturers putting emphasis on quality.

One such firm is Century Microelectronics, Inc., in Santa
Clara, California. Century, an industry leader in the
manufacture of computer memory, has implemented extra measures
to ensure its memory modules maintain the highest quality
standards.

One way Century does this is by dealing directly with only the
largest, most reputable DRAM manufacturers who have strict
internal controls. Century then adds its own quality
protective measures. For example, each assembled module bears
the Century name to insure strict accountability. The consumer
can clearly identify that the module has been assembled by
Century and not another third party manufacturer with lower
standards. Unless the circuit board manufacturer puts their
name on the board as Century does, there is virtually no way
to trace the product back to the manufacturer when troubles
arise.

Companies like Century use the highest quality components not
just in the DRAM, but in the design and manufacture of the PC
board as well. This philosophy has so far served companies
like Century well in the marketplace where wholesalers,
retailers and consumers have voiced concern over the affect of
Techno-Crime on overall product quality. "A big part of my
business is the ability to give my customers the reliability
that they are getting a first rate part," said Gary Barlow,
owner of RAMTECH in Boulder, Colo., the computer memory
supplier to a majority of users in that area.

"Most of the time price is not the issue as long as you're
reasonable," Barlow explained citing his reason for relying on
Century as his prime memory supplier. "I've been in this
business a long time and I believe Century has the highest
quality parts available," he said. Micro Solutions' Wong who
often utilizes Century products because of their inherent
reliability, agreed with Barlow on stressing quality. "We're
just a small company so what's really important is who our
clients are and the type of machines that we configure," Wong
explained. "We have some pretty major clients like Hewlett
Packard who buy our memory products for insertion into their
own machines so quality is very important to us."

To less scrupulous suppliers, however, price, not quality, is
the primary motivator. Because of competition from makers of
cheap "clone" systems, keeping costs down has become paramount
to both supplier and manufacturer. In this market climate,
even well known original equipment manufacturers (OEMS)
sometimes offer to buy back old memory chips as credit towards
new memory purchases. These suppliers then reuse the memory,
which, since it is used, has a shorter life cycle.

While this might not appear to be an obvious Techno-Crime to
the consumer, such as armed theft or the like, it is, in fact
Techno-Crime in its worst form because while the monetary cost
is just as severe, the crime itself is all but impossible to
detect.

Another factor in the link is when OEMs put pressure on chip
suppliers to step-up production so that increasing market
demand can be met. To please their OEM customers, memory
brokers with limited resources are often tempted to purchase
substandard parts in the "gray market" because they are being
offered a deal that is too good to pass up.

Of particular concern to manufacturers is that substandard
parts within the gray market have often failed to test to
"grade All specification and instead of ending up as scrap or
in a lower performance non-computer application as intended,
the y often end up in machines where they are not up to the
task.

A chip that shows a 60 nanosecond (60ns) rating, for instance,
could really only be able to perform up to a 70ns level.
Pressed for time, unscrupulous suppliers can't be bothered
with checking for quality so substandard memory batches are
either mixed with those having passed inspection, or are
simply remarked with the higher rating that OEMs require.

To remark a product, third party manufacturers will actually
sand the identifying marks off of chips, remark them so that
they appear to be higher performance chips than they actually
are, and resell them to unsuspecting buyers. The
manufacturers, then, end up installing the lower quality
components in their machines because many trust their memory
distributors to bench test the chips. But unfortunately, many
distributors in need of quick revenue unload the components
without testing them. Installed in machines they weren't
intended for, these parts fail immediately, or after a few
months of use.

And while a substandard chip may only cause a computerized toy
to go haywire, it could just as well put a glitch into the
navigational system of a commercial airliner or cause a
surgical device to malfunction, putting patients at risk. Even
if only a small percentage of available computer chips are
faulty, but are resold as acceptable, the implications are
frightening.

Because popular new software programs require more memory than
ever to operate efficiently, technology market analysts say
the demand for memory modules is likely to remain higher than
the supply. Manufacturers will probably continue to experience
periodic chip shortages which will drive up the value of
memory modules, and drive more OEMs into the gray market.
Consumers should understand that they can easily fall victim
to Techno-Thievery without realizing it because Techno-Crimes
are not always obvious. Unless buyers take extra precautions
to ensure the quality of the product they are buying, they run
the risk of purchasing substandard components that could not
be able to perform up to advertised specifications, or could
fail altogether causing disastrous results.

In light of all this, consumer awareness is increasing and the
demand for superior computer components from the highest
quality manufacturers is expected to be greater than ever.

System Alerts
Drowsy Drivers

In what has been billed as a first of its kind effort, scientists
at the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI, 5000 Forbes Ave.,
Pittsburgh, PA 15213) are developing a comprehensive sensor system
to combat drowsy driving.

The project, which got underway in June 1995, is supported by a
two-year, $1.2 million contract from the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA, Washington, DC) and will be completed
by mid-1997.  Some additional engineering support is being provided
by the Volvo/GM Heavy Truck Div. The National Private Truck Council
(Alexandria, VA) assisted in selecting the test vehicles.

The NHTSA is supporting a program to combat drowsy driving, with
particular emphasis on heavy trucks because of the severe damage
these accidents cause, and the toll in human lives they extract.
Over the years, surveys have shown that drowsiness, related fatigue
and inattention are the major causes of truck driver fatalities.

Since mid-1995, CMRI scientists have been assessing, testing and
developing effective drowsy driver sensor technologies.  At the end
of the project they hope to have available a set of functional
specifications for drowsy driver alert systems that can be
manufactured for use, first in trucks, and later in cars.

Richard Grace (Tel: 412/268-3493) of the CMRI Advanced Devices and
Materials Group, and project co-director, said this is a two phase
effort.  Phase I, now in progress, involves selection of sensors,
systems engineering and reliability testing and finally,
installation in the selected test vehicles.  Two physical
prototypes are being produced, and will, of course, be subject to
further modification depending upon the outcome of testing.

Phase II, starting in June and running until mid-1997, will consist
of data collection under actual over-the-road conditions and
relating this information to previously developed drowsiness
measurements.

Grace said the prototype system will be comprised of a black box
installed next to the driver's seat, a sensor on the steering
column, two video cameras (one to scan the driver's face along with
a video recorder to capture reactions and another pointed out the
window), a floor-mounted accelerometer, a powerful on-board
computer to store test data, and an audio warning device possibly
dashboard-mounted.

There also will be a video-based lane position sensor with a
Pentium processor.  This is the same unit that was developed by
Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Lab, and which was featured prominently
in last year's "No Hands Across America" trial (ATTN, September
1995).

These modules will communicate with each other through an Echelon
(Palo Alto, CA) LanWorks communications bus.  The several modules,
while being designed as stand-alone systems, will interact with one
another as a distributed control system.

The three main units will "decide" if the driver is drowsy, and
then relay this information to an independent warning system,
possibly an audio device that will alert the driver.  Grace noted
that the system modules are basically simple, inexpensive to
produce and could have multiple uses in the truck.

In June, with all component testing completed, the system will be
installed in two tractor trailers supplied by Averitt Express
(Cookeville, TN).  Averitt specializes in package delivery with
many of its runs taking place between midnight and 8:00 AM.  The
test vehicles will be based at the company's Charlotte, NC
terminal.

In this second phase, the sensor system's ability to alert or even
rouse drivers will be thoroughly evaluated.  As part of the
process, a camera will document lane departures, and steering
column sensors will document erratic or jerky movements.  This
information will be correlated with data obtained from the
physiological and psychological measures that relate to the
driver's state of alertness, e.g., eye movement and eye closing.

Grace added that researchers developed drowsiness "standards"
through videotapes of drivers' eyes.  In other words, the
percentage of time they are open or closed.  For example, when
someone is sleepy, normal blinks which last about a millisecond,
are extended and a person can unknowingly end up with eyes closed
about 15% of the time. Kind of scary when driving a 16-wheeler
along a crowded interstate at maximum speed.

MLANS Could
Prevent Accidents

Nichols Research Corp. (NRC, 251 Edgewater Dr., Wakefield, MA
02146) is working with a technology that could provide computer
solutions to complicated problems not likely to be solved by past
artificial intelligence approaches.

The Maximum Likelihood Adaptive Neural System (MLANS), was
originally funded by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization
(BMDO - 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301-7100) for "Star
Wars" space-based uses.  Actual work started some seven years ago
when BMDO was looking for a way to automatically recognize targets
in clutter and noise.

NRC is currently developing a number of system applications based
on this technology.  Of primary interest to the ITS universe is the
work being done on MLANS-based collision avoidance systems and
computer-assisted road navigation systems.  These were demonstrated
during a recent test of unmanned Army vehicles.

MLANS analyzes sensor data streams and adaptively classifies and
tracks objects of interest while suppressing clutter and noise.
The system used supplied object models and adapted them to changing
environments, or adaptively constructed statistical models of what
objects looked like, then refined the models as it sorted through
the stream of image data being received.  The recent tests
demonstrated the feasibility of road tracking on dirt, gravel and
paved surfaces as well as areas that were shaded and leaf covered.

According to Leonid Perlovsky (Tel: 617/246-4200), NRC's chief
scientist, the unmanned navigation vehicle technology has not as
yet been tested under actual highway conditions.  He noted that his
company's efforts are still in the development stage and any
commercial offerings are still some years away.  Perlovsky also
said this point can't be reached without significant investment and
at present, there is no way of knowing what kinds of dollars will
be required.

In taking a closer look at the technology involved, neural networks
are computer systems that can recognize an object by "learning"
from previous experiences or input.  Their design uses the
principle of brain organization--a large number of interconnected
processing elements called neurons.  Neural networks are attractive
because they can be created without the lengthy and tedious process
of eliciting rules from human experts and then coding them into a
computer.

The MLANS, as developed by NRC, solves the long-standing artificial
intelligence problem of combining adaptive learning with prior
knowledge by using a priori models in a neural architecture.  With
fuzzy logic, each piece of data is associated with the appropriate
a priori model.

MLANS has been coded in a variety of programming languages,
including FORTRAN and C, and runs on any number of systems,
including personal computers.

In addition to ITS applications, MLANS-based systems have potential
uses for law enforcement agencies and can also be used for medical
diagnostics, oil exploration, or for locating objects under foliage
and in heavy clutter.

Perlovsky cited the development, for NASA research and rescue
operations, of an MLANS-based detection algorithm to find small
aircraft that might have crashed in heavily wooded areas.

Military Technology
Makes Smart Trailers

Military communications technology originally designed to "get the
message through" in spite of jamming and other battlefield signal
interference will soon be used to locate and track trailers on
America's highways.

QUALCOMM Inc., (6455 Lusk Blvd., San Diego, CA 92121; Tel: 619/587-
1121) has signed an exclusive development and supply contract with
Elisra Electronic Systems Ltd. (29 Hamerkava St., Holon, Israel),
a subsidiary of Tadiran Ltd. (575 Lexington Ave., 21st Fl., New
York, NY 10022; Tel: 212/751-3600), for communications hardware for
Untethered TrailerTRACS, QUALCOMM's new trailer tracking system.
The "TRACS" stands for Thin Route (low data rate) Alpha Numeric
Communications System.

The agreement also gives QUALCOMM exclusive resale rights in this
country for trailer tracking applications with rights to extend
worldwide and to include other specific markets such as barges and
trains.

According to Jim Clifford, QUALCOMM OmniTRACS Div. director of new
product development, this is representative of Elisra's efforts to
introduce, into the commercial marketplace, technology originally
developed for military applications.

Untethered TrailerTRACS itself should be commercially available
during the fourth quarter this year. Standard price for a single
trailer system is expected to be $790.  The basic monitoring rate
will be about $10/unit/month.

Clifford said prototypes are now being tested and evaluated, and
one goal will be the ability to track a trailer within 1500 ft.  He
also noted that an optional GPS capability will be available to
track within 300 ft.  Designed to QUALCOMM's specifications, the
unit is about the size of a book and measures 8 in. by 4.9 in. x
2.4 in.  Enclosed in an ABS case, it can operate within a
temperature range of -40(C to +70(C.

The unit is battery powered.  When the tractor and trailer are
paired, it works off the tractor's 12v electrical system.  When
unhooked, the battery takes over.  It can be recharged from the
truck when the trailer is connected and has a 35-45 day life span
while disconnected.  The system also offers battery condition and
present charge-level monitoring.

The unit can be mounted inside a trailer wall.  Separate
omnidirectional antenna packages offer the option of mounting
either high on the "nose" of the trailer, or flat on the roof.  The
roof mounting requires approximately a half-inch clearance.

Untethered TrailerTRACS will provide two-way messaging and position
determination of any trailer while connected to or disconnected
from the tractor.  Using Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite service
from ORBCOMM (21700 Atlantic Blvd., Dulles, VA 20166; Tel: 703/406-
5310) which provides global coverage.  The OmniTRACS Division is a
reseller of ORBCOMM services to the trucking industry.

Initial service using two satellites will be "intermittent," with
three to four satellite looks per day at any point on the earth.
Near continuous coverage is expected in 1997 when ORBCOMM is
scheduled to launch an additional 24 satellites. Clifford noted
that this system essentially takes the intelligence that now
resides in the tractor and puts it in the trailer.  He explained
that Untethered TrailerTRACS offers exception-based messaging.

For example, an itinerary can be stored in the trailer unit.
Information might include appointment times, specific destinations,
layover time, trucking company involved, tractor number, or
whatever.  If the trip goes according to plan, no messages will be
sent.  If there is a delay, the unit can recalculate and if an on
time or near-on time arrival is indicated, there still won't be any
messages.

However, if a trailer didn't move when expected, or an unplanned
move took place, or the wrong trailer is connected or disconnected
to a tractor or a trailer is late for an intermodal drop, an
exception alert is triggered.

This information is sent immediately to the OmniTRACS Network
Management Center (NMC) in San Diego (CA) and then routed to the
customer for action. The center is staffed around-the-clock every
day.  And there also is a back-up center in Las Vegas (NV).

Clifford pointed out an additional feature of the system:
refrigeration system monitoring.  On an exception basis, reefer
data is sent over-the-air to alert users to an immediate problem,
e.g., wrong set point, refrigeration unit failure, unloaded reefer
running, or temperature out of range.  Wherever possible,
corrections can be made remotely, or help can be summoned.

QUALCOMM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses and operates
advanced communications systems and products based on its
proprietary digital wireless technology.

Elisra  is known for its electronic warfare systems and develops,
manufactures and markets advanced electronics products, including
sophisticated jammers, RF and microwave components, ELINT systems
and data links

Amtech to Track
Grocery Chain Fleet

Last month, Amtech Systems Corp. (17304 Preston Rd., Bldg. E100,
Dallas, TX 75252-5613) signed a $310,000 contract with H.E.B (San
Antonio, TX), the nation's 13th largest grocery store chain, to
supply a wireless system for paperless, non-stop identification of
its motor freight fleet.  Beverly Fuortes (Tel: 214/733-6059),
Amtech's director of corporate development, said the system is now
being installed and should be fully operational in March.

The wireless system will use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
technology to provide real-time information on the 1,500 tractors
and trailers in the H.E.B. fleet.  Equipment will be deployed at
terminal gates at the grocery chain's 262 stores throughout the
southwest.  H.E.B. will use the Amtech system to improve equipment
and inventory accuracy, as well as to eliminate paperwork and
increase employee productivity by automating the vehicle tracking
procedure at terminals.

With Amtech's SmartPass readers in place at terminal exit and entry
points, all motor fleet equipment with an RFID tag will be
identified immediately, even at unmanned terminals.  The grocery
store chain will use the Amtech system, in conjunction with its
existing system, to gather information and match it with fleet
information in the company's database.

With this real-time data in hand, H.E.B. will be able to monitor
operations, increase tracking capabilities and improve asset
management - all through wireless data communications.

Clinton Inks 1996
Transportation Bills

The fiscal year 1996 Dept. of Transportation (DOT) appropriations
bill was signed late last year by President Clinton.  The bill
includes $223 million for federal aid to ITS projects, down about
$4.5 million from $227.5 million last year.  The DOT can now
proceed with development of a plan to reorganize its surface
transportation activities.

Also part of the bill is a $17.5 billion obligation ceiling for
highways which represents a $300 million increase over present
levels.  Another $2.3 billion will be available for emergency
relief and minimum allocation programs, bringing the total for
highways to $19.9 billion, only $545 million below the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) authorized level.

Generally speaking, the transportation budget was up by $1.8
billion over 1995's $35.58 billion.  But transit funding was cut by
$600 million from 1995 levels, and includes $2 billion for formula
grants and $1.6 billion for discretionary grants.  Transit
operating assistance was cut by $310 million to a level of $400
million.

According to ITS America, congress will give serious consideration
to dropping the practice of earmarking funds for ITS in next year's
bill.

Funding (in millions) breaks out as follows: $24.5 for R&D, $32.5
for operational tests, $14.5 for Commercial Vehicle Operations
(CVO), $14.0 for Automated Highway Systems (AHS), $11.3 for program
and system support, and $13.0 for crash avoidance research, for a
total of $109.8 million.

At the same time, the president signed into law the National
Highway Systems (NHS) bill.  This legislation designates a national
system of primary highways and bridges, some 160,000 miles worth,
considered essential to the country's economy and defense.

Among the bill's provisions are the controversial repeal of the 55
mph speed limit and a repeal of funding penalties for states that
fail to enact motorcycle helmet laws.  It also delays indefinitely
any federal mandates to use signs with metric measurements, and
waives until 2000, federal requirements that states convert their
plans and specifications to metric.

Fare Hikes Become
Nationwide Trend

According to a report recently released by the American Public
Transit Association, (APTA, 1201 New York Ave. NW, Washington, DC
20005; Tel: 202/898-4115), four out of 10 of this country's public
transit systems will raise passenger fares and cut back service
during 1995, mostly as a result of reductions in federal transit
aid.

APTA said a survey of 157 transit agencies showed that fare
increases during the year will average 25% and that a typical
service reduction will represent 11% of existing bus and train
service.  More than three-quarters of the responding agencies said
state and local governments are not likely to replace the lost
federal funds.

The cuts will hit hardest at lines serving small and rural areas.
For example, an urban transit system might raise fares about 20%
and a medium area about 23%.  However, small/rural area riders
could be looking at a 34% increase.  The same impact ratios prevail
in the other categories.

Transit agencies attributed about three-quarters of the fare hikes
and service cuts to past and pending reductions in federal transit
operating assistance.  In the federal fiscal year just ended,
operating grants were reduced by 11.5%, and legislation pending in
Congress could cut remaining funds by another 44% in FY 1996.  In
total, federal operating assistance will be cut in half, from $802
million in Fiscal Year 1994 to $400 million. Of the responding
agencies, 36% plan to delay expansion and 40% could cut service and
raise fares.

Recent fare increases implemented by New York City's Metropolitan
Transit Authority (MTA) are a case in point.  Not only will they
apply to subways and busses, but later in 1996, to bridges and
tunnels as well. Over the past 13 years, the MTA has spent $20
billion to rebuild and modernize its system, especially the
subways.  The results are bearing fruit and have drawn wide praise
from many of its millions of daily riders.

With state and federal subsidies being cut substantially, the MTA
has had to raise bus and subway fares by 20% from $1.25 to $1.50,
and commuter rail fares on average by 9%, making these rates among
the highest in the country. Beyond that, there is the threat of
reduced service, fewer improvements and less attention paid to
maintenance and passenger comfort.  Not a pretty picture overall.

In looking at the prospect of higher fares, one individual
concluded that even with a 20% increase, the subway still was still
a better deal than having to drive, put up with traffic and having
to pay even higher parking fees.

In light of all this, late last month, President Clinton signed
into law H.R. 2002, the Fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill for
the Dept. of Transportation (DOT).  The law cuts federal transit
aid 12.2% overall in contrast with 1995, and includes reductions of
48% in operating grants for transit agencies serving metro areas of
200,000 or greater.  Smaller systems will experience a 25% cut.

Neural Network
to Control Traffic

Nestor, Inc. (Providence, RI) and Matrix Corp. (1203 New Hope Rd.,
Raleigh, NC 27610-1474; Tel: 919/231-8000) are working with Jet
Propulsion Lab at the California Institute of Technology (JPL,
Pasadena, CA) to develop VideoTrac, an advanced traffic
surveillance system.  This effort is being administered by JPL for
the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA, Washington, DC).

According to Matrix and JPL, VideoTrac "will increase traffic
capacity on existing roads and reduce the need for new highway
construction."  Delivery of the system is expected sometime during
the fourth quarter this year.

VideoTrac will use video cameras, Matrix's Advanced Traffic
Controller (SmartATC) and Nestor's Ni1000 Recognition Accelerator
chips to recognize moving vehicles on highways and intersections.
The Ni1000 neural network chip, developed jointly by Nestor and
Intel, is at the heart of the system.  Matrix will incorporate the
chip into a compact, low cost module that will plug into advanced
traffic controllers like the Caltrans 2070 or TS3.

The system can control traffic signals, notify drivers of traffic
conditions and redirect traffic.  Unlike systems that use sensors
buried under the roadway, VideoTrac will be able to recognize
vehicles by type (car, truck, bus, motorcycle), monitor speeds,
turn and lane switching movements, travel times, and even report
accidents.

The chip simultaneously performs these functions at full-motion
video speeds across multiple lanes.  It will "see" the number of
cars heading its way and know the speed of each.  At an
intersection, a traffic control device could decide whether to
extend a green light or stop traffic because a line of vehicles is
waiting in the intersection.

David Mosier, Matrix president and CEO, said, "There are
approximately 250,000 intersections in the U.S. that would
potentially benefit from video detection technology, as well as
tens of thousands of highway locations."

Nestor, by the way, develops and markets business information
systems that extract actionable knowledge from data through pattern
recognition.  Among the company's offerings are N'Route software
that reads and distributes faxes electronically, NestorReader and
OmniTools, intelligent character recognition software, and PRISM
for identifying fraudulent bankcard transactions from subtle
patterns of purchasing behavior.  Next stop: the Interstate.

GDS Partners with
Israel's MAVIX

Graphic Data Systems Corp. (GDS, 6200 S. Syracuse Way, Suite 250,
Englewood, CO 80111; Tel: 303/741-8484) has established an alliance
with MAVIX Ltd. (Haifa, Israel).  Both entities hope to create an
interface between their respective technologies.

 MAVIX provides remote intelligence surveillance monitoring and
control systems for the transportation and security industries with
an emphasis on Automatic Traffic Management Systems (ATMS).  GDS
offers real-time Geographic Information System (GIS) solutions for
ATMS, traffic operations centers, transit information, vehicle
permitting and routing, and Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency (ISTEA) management.

A GDS spokesperson said his company and MAVIX are currently working
on three joint traffic system proposals but nothing is ready to
announce at this time.

MAVIX's monitoring and control systems include color cameras with
pan, tilt and zoom remote control, vehicle loop detectors, ramp
metering devices, variable message signs, audio devices and traffic
signal monitoring devices. Signals from these devices are
transmitted via bi-directional connectivity to traffic control
centers to provide real-time, full-motion visual monitoring of
traffic conditions, as well as voice connection with traffic
control personnel and roadway SOS locations.

As a result of this partnership, traffic information processed by
the MAVIX system can now be reviewed in real-time as color coded
maps on the GDS GIS-based software system.  Maps will display the
current locations of objects, events and their relationships, as
well as current traffic conditions at any given moment.  Traffic
control operators will be able to analyze and respond immediately
to changing conditions and incidents as they happen.

Both companies look on this partnership as a way to build open
systems that "are never closed to future options but allow for
expansion of capacity and functionality in an efficient, resilient
manner."

Ford and China
Look at 'Good Earth'

Ford Motor Co. (The American Road, Dearborn, MI 48121; Tel:
313/337-2456) and researchers from the Peoples Republic of China
(PRC) have joined in a cooperative effort to develop catalytic
converters using rare earth metals for vehicle emission control.
The three-year cooperative catalyst research program got underway
at the end of last year, and will receive more than $1.5 million in
funding support from Ford and several Chinese government
organizations.

China has the largest proven reserves of these metals which can be
used in catalytic converters to cut vehicle emissions of
hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide.  The country
recently adopted legal guidelines for auto emissions which ban
production, sale or import of cars that exceed established
pollution levels.  The joint research effort will also investigate
environmental solutions to help mitigate China's rampant air
pollution problems.

John McTague, Ford VP of technical affairs, said, "Rare earth
oxides, alone or possibly with the addition of small amounts of
precious metals, could create a robust emission control catalyst
that China can produce for its own market or for potential export."

Rare earth oxides, in particular cerium and lanthanum, combine with
other metals to improve the performance of an automotive emissions
catalyst.  During changes in driving speed and fuel mixture, the
rare earth oxides can either store or release oxygen into the
exhaust mixture and keep the catalyst performing under more
constant conditions and at a high level.

These oxides can also help in cold-start emissions control.  When
the catalyst is cold during the first few minutes of operation, it
operates inefficiently, so much so that it is during this period
that the majority of hydrocarbons are emitted.  If the catalyst
could be moved closer to the engine and be able to withstand the
higher operating temperatures, it could warm up more quickly and
reduce cold start emissions.

With a new emphasis on stricter emission standards by government
regulatory agencies, research interest in rare earth oxides has
increased.  The Chinese are looking to use these oxides as a major
component of catalytic converters for their domestically-
manufactured vehicles, while minimizing the use of precious metals,
e.g., platinum, palladium and rhodium.

$7 Billion Future for
OEM Safety Markets

A study just released by Business Communications Co. (BCC, 25 Van
Zant St., Norwalk, CT 06855-1781; Tel: 203/853-4266), explores
current markets and future business opportunities for OEM
automotive safety electronics in light vehicles assembled in this
country and Canada.

According to the study, "the average safety electronics content now
stands at $329 per vehicle, and is equivalent to 1.7% of the total
value of the average light vehicle produced in North America."  The
report goes on to predict that over the next five years, sales of
automotive safety electronics are expected to increase 8.6% per
year, reaching $7.19 billion by the year 2000.

By then, the average automotive safety electronics content is
expected to reach $485, equivalent to 2.0% of the total average
vehicle value. The future will continue to brighten as the public
begins asking for more safety features and the automobile
manufacturers begin meeting this demand with new and better
technological approaches.

The study declares that "the next five years will witness the near
universal adoption of ABS and driver- and passenger-side airbags.
Four-wheel ABS will also largely supplant two-wheel systems during
this period.  Rapid growth in side-impact and other airbags will
present strong business opportunities as will Traction Control
Systems (TCS)."  Other growth areas involve production of anti-
theft devices and collision avoidance systems.

The report calls attention to changes in the safety electronics
market.   These include lean manufacturing, just-in-time inventory
management, outsourcing, supplier consolidation, greater design and
engineering responsibility given to suppliers, and increasingly
sophisticated systems as more advanced electronic features are
added to vehicles.

With this in mind, the study goes on to say that the next five
years will see more supplier consolidation among the automobile
companies, increased electronics content and expanded supplier
responsibilities.  "This will, however, provide unique business
opportunities for those suppliers able to adapt to the new
environment," the report concludes.

Available from BCC for $2750, the report covers such technologies
as air bags and related passenger restraint systems, ABS, collision
avoidance and warning systems, electronic traction control, anti-
theft devices, and other safety electronics.  It also covers in
detail the socio-political, economic, regulatory and technological
issues that are regarded as critical to the industry's current
state of change.

Etak Realigns
Product Lines

Etak, Inc. (1430 O'Brien Dr., Menlo Park, CA 94025; Tel: 415/328-
3825) has realigned two product groups through a merger of its
Information Group, which focused on product marketing development
and sales, with its Commercial Solutions division.  The company
said this will allow it to take advantage of the fast-growing
market for highly detailed, accurate, electronic road maps and
business demographic data.

Last year, Etak created business units to better focus on the needs
of the particular markets it serves.  It found considerable
crossover development between the Information Group, which
specialized in geographical marketing products, and the Commercial
Solutions group which was involved with operations such as
facilities management, routing and scheduling, fleet management,
property risk and call-before-you-dig applications.

Since the Information Group's geographical marketing products were
also of interest to commercial customers, it made sense to
consolidate the groups, according to an Etak official.

Products previously sold thorough the Information Group in
Princeton, NJ, and now under the Commercial Solutions umbrella
include TargetView, a Microsoft Windows-based geographical
marketing system that combines Etak's digital street maps with
locations of more than nine million businesses and 85 million
households nationwide; PostalPoints, a database of Postal Service
ZIP+4 code locations, and Eagle Geocoding services which allow
rapid matching of addresses to map locations.

Key customers who use the marketing-related products include Acxiom
Corp. and Database America Companies, developers of a number of
business and industry data products. Etak's other marketing
groupings are the Automotive Products division offering digital map
and navigation software products for vehicle navigation and
information systems, and the ITS Group, offering technology and
market development strategies to the ITS market that includes major
mass transit facilities.

Intermodal EV
Trials to Continue

The National Station Car Assn. (963 Hillcroft Circle, Oakland, CA
94610) intends to "charge ahead."  According to Victoria Nerenberg,
the organization's president, "The momentum built in the National
Station Car Program is so strong that it will continue despite
changes in any of the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandates."

She was referring to California's recent decision to back away from
a requirement that within two years 2% of all cars sold in the
state be electric powered.  The state's Air Resources Board asked
for a suspension of this requirement, and a final decision has yet
to be made.  There also were claims of automobile industry pressure
on state officials to make the change.  Both Massachusetts and New
York followed California with similar mandates, and a Federal
appeals court in New York recently upheld that state's right to
proceed with the California plan.  No word on Massachusetts.

(Earlier this month, General Motors announced that this fall it
would be selling an electric car, the EV1, in Los Angeles, San
Diego, Phoenix and Tucson.  A GM official said there was no
incongruity between hints of industry pressure and the marketing
announcement.  Called the first vehicle designed specifically for
electric propulsion, it is expected to sell for about $35,000.)

Nerenberg is the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District manager for
the San Francisco Bay Area station car demonstration (ATTN,
December 1995).  She noted that plans are already underway to
expand the demonstration "far beyond" the 40 cars that will be part
of the initial demonstration begun late last year.

The Association's executive director, Martin Bernard (Tel: 510/839-
6054), said station car demonstrations will be expanded or
initiated in South Florida, Atlanta, the New York City suburbs, New
Jersey and Northern and Southern California.

Station cars are small electric passenger vehicles driven to and
from mass transit stations by transit riders.  They are an
extension of mass transit, providing the same mobility as
conventional vehicles.  While away from the station they can be
used for any type of short trip.

Rome Adopts
GDS Software

The airport serving Rome (Italy) has purchased software from
Graphic Data Systems Corp. (GDS, 6200 S. Syracuse Way, Suite 250,
Englewood, CO 80111; Tel: 303/741-8484) to manage its
infrastructure, including facilities, the land surrounding the
airport, runways, and underground networks.

Rome Airport handles approximately 70% of all airline passengers in
Italy, or about 20 million annually.  Airport officials expect that
number to double by the year 2002.

The GDS Automated Mapping/Facilities Management (AM/FM) and
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) capabilities will be used for
the airport's expansion projects currently underway on various
areas of the airport's facilities and runways.

GDS will be used to map and manage the landbase area of the airport
and manage the thousands of construction change documents
associated with the project.  Personnel will also be able to use
the system's Computer Aided Drafting and Design (CAD) function for
2-D or 3-D drawings of the airport's physical structure and for
facility development and management.

The airport has 12 sets of GDS software running on seven Digital
Equipment Co. (DEC) Alpha workstations with support from two Alpha
servers linked by optic fiber.  One server functions as an
applications development system.  The other is split into
individual client centers where the work is divided into facilities
management, land management and runway development.

Raytheon Stars
with FAA

The Raytheon (141 Spring St., Lexington, MA 02173; Tel: 617/860-
2414) Electronic Systems Standard Terminal Replacement System
(STARS) team recently passed the Federal Aviation Administration's
(FAA) Operational Capability Demonstration (OCD), the last step in
qualifying the team to bid on the FAA STARS replacement program.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) from the FAA for STARS is expected
this month.

The STARS system will modernize and upgrade more than 240 Terminal
Radar Approach Control Systems (TRACONS) in the present FAA
National Airspace System which serves both civilian and military
installations.

This modernization program, valued in excess of $1 billion dollars,
will replace aging terminal automation equipment and will interface
with the FAA's en route system, also scheduled for modernization
under the Display System Replacement Program (which includes
Raytheon's controller workstations).

The Raytheon demonstration featured the company's AutoTrac system
for full service level functionality, Hughes (Information Systems,
Fullerton, CA) TracView system for emergency service, and UFA's
(Lexington, MA) ATCoach system for the test and training simulator.

Integrated for the STARS OCD, these open-architecture systems have
been hosted on a variety of commercial off-the-shelf hardware
platforms for terminal and en route applications in 19 countries.

In another move, Swiss Air Navigation Services Ltd. (swisscontrol)
awarded a $5.5 million contract to Raytheon Canada Ltd. (Waterloo,
Ont.; Tel: 519/895-0110) for two air traffic control primary
radars.  They are scheduled to become operational in mid-1997.
Other bidders for the project were Westinghouse, Thomson-CSF and
Alenia.

According to Richard Gaffney, president of Raytheon Canada, it is
the company's "first win in Europe against stiff international
competition."  At the present time, 27 solid-state radars are
installed worldwide, and an additional 30 are under production.

The contract calls for Raytheon to provide two ASR10SS primary
radars for the Zurich and Geneva airports.  These are the company's
latest generation air cooled, all solid-state primary surveillance
radars.  The contract also includes the production, installation
and testing of the complete system.

PR Program to
Deflect Driver Ire

There's always some pain associated with progress, or so it seems.
And when it comes to new highway construction, millions of
motorists the world over have tales of woe to tell.

 But in New Mexico, the Middle Rio Grande Council of Governments
(MRGCOG,  317 Commercial NE, Albuquerque, NM 87102) and the New
Mexico State Highway and Transportation Dept. (NMSHTD) are
embarking on a project they hope will ease the pain of a $35
million major reconstruction of I-40 scheduled to take anywhere
from two to three years to complete.  Work on the highway, which
runs right through Albuquerque, will start this spring.

In an effort to minimize the impact of the construction in the
urban area, maintain an orderly traffic flow, reduce driver
frustration and promote alternate forms of transportation, MRGCOG
and the NMSHTD decided to initiate a construction impact public
awareness program.

Holmes & Narver, Inc., (H&N, 6501 Americas Parkway, NE,
Albuquerque, NM 87110; Tel: 505/889-4100) has been named to a team
charged with developing and implementing a campaign to promote
community awareness of the construction project and how it will
impact on local streets, freeways, arterial roadways and the area's
transit system.  This public relations effort will run through 1988
or later.

Susan Johnson & Associates, an Albuquerque public relations firm,
heads the team with H&N providing advice on construction impacts,
congestion and transit concerns.  The effort, which will cost about
$300,000 is being funded partly by National Highway System
construction money along with state and local dollars.  A first
draft of the program should be ready next month.

Ron Forte (Tel: 505/247-1750), MRGCOG's director of transportation,
said there will be massive disruption where I-40 runs through part
of the city.  Also there will be considerable ramp work and very
little opportunity to divert traffic.  "We've never done anything
like this before and we're always being criticized for construction
delays and a lack of information.  So we decided to develop a
program to let drivers know what is open or closed and when, and
what progress is being made.  We want them to know what's happening
every step of the way," Forte added.

Driver information will be provided by variable message signs,
billboards with message banners that can be changed without redoing
the entire billboard when new information becomes available,
newspaper and television advertising, and standard construction
signage.

Forte said the campaign signature will be New Mexico's state bird,
the Road Runner (not the famous cartoon character).  It will appear
on signage and advertising related to the project.  While motorists
won't be able to move through construction zones with the speed of
a Road Runner, they will at least know what's ahead.

MDOT Truck Permits
Go Automatic

The Michigan Dept. of Transportation (MDOT, State Transportation
Building, 425 W. Ottawa St., P.O. Box 350, Lansing, MI 48909; Tel:
517/373-2090) has purchased Permitting and Routing Solutions (PARS)
commercial vehicle permitting automation software for
oversize/overweight vehicle operations.  The system is being
supplied by Graphic Data Systems Corp. (GDS, 6200 S. Syracuse Way,
Suite 250, Englewood, CO 80111; Tel: 303/741-8484).

MDOT is now studying ways to configure existing data to meet new
system requirements and also to determine just what data will be
needed to ensure maximum efficiency.  GDS says the software should
be in place by the second quarter this year.

MDOT issues some 120,000 trucking permits annually to enforce
compliance with motor code requirements for truck weight, height,
length and width. Currently, this is a totally manual operation
handled primarily by the Lansing office.  Each permit requires a
written application along with a permit evaluation by a DOT permit
agent.

Agency personnel fax proper documents back and forth to permit
stations around the state, and any delay in response to these
trucking permits can result in lost revenue for the state, and at
times, illegal hauling.

When PARS is in place, the entire process will be automated. Within
a matter of seconds, it will handle everything from ensuring
application compliance and determining a safe route, to issuing and
automatically faxing permits, and accounting for all transactions
involved.

David Spangenberg, MDOT engineer - utility permits, said, "Once
PARS is up and running, maximum turnaround time will decrease
instantly and we will eliminate as much paperwork as we can."

PARS, which is designed to automate a full range of operations
associated with permitting and routing oversize and overweight
vehicles, was released by GDS late last year.  The software
package, originally known as RouteBuilder, was acquired from PEAK
Solutions Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) early in 1995 (ATTN, May 1995).

Keeping BART's
Passengers Informed

Daktronics, Inc. (331 Thirty-Second Ave., P.O. Box 5128, Brookings,
SD 57006; Tel: 605/697-4300) has received a $1 million contract
from San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District for
Light Emitting Diode (LED) variable message signage.

The contract calls for the design and manufacture of 44 outdoor
Destination Sign Units (DSU) for installation in five new train
stations.  BART also has the option to purchase and install an
additional $3.6 million worth of DSUs over the next five years as
funding becomes available.  These additional signs will replace
those in the other 34 BART stations.

The DSU system will consist of two-sided LED signs located over
passenger areas in the BART rail stations.  Signs will feature
full-matrix LED displays capable of showing up to four lines of 3
in. high variable text, as well as graphics and animation.  The
DSUs will communicate safety tips, BART rules, train arrival times,
train destinations, public service announcements, advertising, and
most importantly, the time.

DSUs will be controlled by BART's central control computer which
communicates via the Ethernet network.  This same computer also
operates all BART trains.

BART, a rapid transit rail system, serves passengers in the five-
county area surrounding San Francisco.  It currently includes 34
passenger stations and four routes -- about 72 miles of double
track.

Is There Maglev in
Houston's Future?

Most efforts to make Magnetic Levitation (maglev) transportation a
reality in this country are either in proposal, planning or early
prototype.  Now, added to that mix is the effort of a group of
students at the University of Alabama (Huntsville).

They have brought forth a proposal outlining the financial and
engineering feasibility of a high speed maglev transportation
system operating in a corridor between the Dallas/Fort Worth and
Houston metropolitan areas.

Maglev, a high-speed magnetically levitated ground transportation
system, offers transportation options which can augment existing
transportation systems.  The maglev vehicle can travel at speeds up
to 300 mph, carry 1200 passengers per hour per direction for the
corridor and also provide transportation for high-value, time
sensitive freight.

The proposal noted that there is a significant market opportunity
for a maglev to service the Dallas-to-Houston area.  The maglev can
expect to capture substantial portions of the air passenger and
freight markets, and 5% to 9% of the enormous automobile passenger
market.   Although the passenger rail market is extremely small,
maglev should capture significantly all of this market and 75% of
the air freight market.

A detailed financial performance indicated that a maglev project is
financially feasible.  It is projected to make money and
simultaneously provide venture capitalists with a high rate of
return and an exit mechanism from the project.

A comprehensive risk analysis, using simulation, indicated an
overwhelming probability of positive financial outcomes for the
project.  The project's projected measure of success, Net Present
Value (NPV), was predicted positive for over 95% of simulated
scenarios.  However, a significant financial commitment from the
federal government would be required to build such a system from
Dallas/Ft. Worth to Houston.

The maglev system is technologically feasible.  The actual
engineering design presented in the proposal was based on the
concept proposed by the Foster-Miller Team in their System Concept
Definition (SCD) study awarded under the National Maglev
Initiative.  It uses mature superconducting magnet technology.

Modifications to the concept were made to enhance revenue and
reduce the cost of building the system.  The proposed design
consists of an at grade, single track guideway with a passing track
in the middle and meets both the passenger capacity and light
weight freight requirements.

A major advantage of maglev is that because the vehicle operates
with almost no moving parts, maintenance requirements are
significantly reduced.  The system is anticipated to have a useful
life of 50 years.  In this design, a derailment situation is
virtually impossible.  The proposed maglev system would be safer
than air, rail or conventional road transportation.

Skycar: New PRT
from Korea

Skycar, a Korean entry in the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT)
technology race, is under development by Woobo Enterprises Company,
Ltd. (Samwon Building, 5th Floor, Nonhyun-dong 210-1 Kangnam-Ku,
Seoul, Korea; Tel: ++ 822-549-6011 or 822-549-6211/3).  Information
on how far the project has gone is somewhat sketchy.  However,
Woobo is currently looking for financial support for engineering
and testing.

Work on Skycar began in 1992 and several feasibility studies for
specific sites in Korea have been conducted.  It appears that the
Skycar PRT concept is very similar to the American TAXI 2000 PRT
concept but with important differences in the design of the
guideway and in the use of an electromagnetic switch instead of a
mechanical switch.

According to Woobo, the system would feature three-passenger
vehicles, a linear motor, and guidewheels for stabilization and
steering.  The proposed guideway is a "U" shaped steel structure
with integrated power supply, signal, communication, steering and
control equipment.

Performance specifications are based on a minimum headway of 1/2
second, maximum capacity of 7,200 vehicles per hour, average
capacity of 6,000 vph, maximum passenger capacity of 18,000 persons
per hour and average capacity of 9,000 persons per hour (at an
average occupancy of 1.5 persons per vehicle).

Average speeds are expected to range from 28-35 mph (45-60 kph).
Last year, a propulsion system development study and a
control/communication system development study were performed by an
independent company.  Woobo also established an adjunct
Transportation and Urban Research Institute to further development
of the Skycar concept.

Highway Good News,
Highway Bad News

In the short space of a week, two of this country's major daily
newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post carried
front page stories featuring the latest in highway technology.
However, when placed side-by-side, one article was filled with hope
and the other with considerable doubt.

First the good news.  In its January 2 edition, the Times heralded
the opening of the Riverside Freeway in Orange County, CA.  The
article commented, "In what transportation specialists say is a
bold experiment in traffic management in the state that made
traffic management both an art form and an oxymoron, a private
company has opened a brand new toll road, the most technologically
sophisticated highway ever built anywhere, smack in the median of
the old jammed road."

The existing Freeway, also known as Highway 91, is one of the most
congested in the state, carrying some 270,000 vehicles daily.
Commuters spend hours in their cars as they attempt to complete a
40 or 50 mile trip to work.

Now, for those willing to pay, the new $126 million, privately-
funded, 10-mile freeway will provide some respite from the daily
grind.  According to the Times, "California Private Transportation
guarantees that any commuter willing to pay the price will have a
delay-free, 65 mph ride through the bottleneck."

Much like telephone rates, toll charges will be based on time-of-
day usage (Value Pricing).  There will be five levels: 25 cents, 50
cents, $1, $1.50 and $2.50.  Three persons in a car ride for free.

These levels are designed to keep traffic moving by reflecting
changing traffic levels on the road.  The more traffic, the higher
the toll. Tolls are being collected electronically and there are no
toll lanes or booths.  Such familiar technologies as Automatic
Vehicle Identification (AVI) technology, transponders, and computer
billing are integrated into roadway operation.

The article noted that the Freeway's "ultimate quality control
device will be its toll schedule posted prominently for all to see
on overhead entrance signs. If at any point over the next several
months, traffic on the road becomes so heavy that delays occur,
fares will be raised for that travel hour until some of the
overload shifts to the old road, however jammed its eight free
lanes might already be."

In other comments, the story noted that, "Besides being the first
private toll road to compete with an adjacent free public road, the
new road is also the world's first fully automated toll road,
relying not just on transponders to collect fares but on other
space age devices to guarantee users a smooth safe ride."  These
include a traffic control center, remote television cameras and
"various combinations of lasers and computers to alert authorities
to problems."

Will it all work?  Only time will tell.

Now for the bad news.  In a story entitled, "Drivers Put the Brakes
on Toll Road's Promise," the December 26 edition of the Post noted
that, "The nation's first privately built highway (Dulles Greenway)
in 150 years has become an embarrassing flop, drawing only a third
of the traffic that the road owner and operator (TRIP II - 109
Carpenter Dr., Suite 200, Sterling, VA 20164; Tel: 703/729-4400)
had predicted."

Greenway traffic has been averaging 10,500 vehicles daily, and is
growing by only 1 to 2% a month, far short of original estimates of
34,000 daily customers.

(It was only last November that ATTN wrote about the Greenway being
completed six months ahead of schedule and under budget.  At that
time, congratulations were in order for those building this
privately owned and operated toll road, a 14 mi. route extending
from US Rte. 15 in Leesburg (VA) to the Washington Dulles
International Airport.  The Greenway also linked with the existing
10.4 mi. Dulles Toll Road, and opened for business last October.)

The Post article went on to say that revenue shortfalls are so
great that unless the Greenway can renegotiate loan terms or find
another source of funding, it will have to turn the road over to
its creditors.  The highway could remain in operation under such a
foreclosure, but TRIP-II could lose as much as $82 million.

In November, to stem its losses, the company laid off 19 full-time
and 20 part-time toll collectors, and to attract more drivers, it
postponed a scheduled January 1 toll increase to $2.00 from $1.75.
TRIP-II is even considering a toll reduction.  The Post noted that
this could backfire if traffic doesn't pick up enough to offset the
drop in revenue per vehicle.  The Greenway company did not release
any financial information to the Post, but the paper reported that
former company officials said first year toll revenue would amount
to about $7 million, compared with the company's targeted $27
million.

So what went wrong?  According to the newspaper account, "A review
of studies the company commissioned, and interviews with former
officials suggest that the Greenway investors made fundamental
mistakes in calculating traffic numbers." Most notably, they never
did any sensitivity studies to see if motorists would pay a $1.75
toll, they relied on outdated traffic flow research, and were
overly optimistic in selecting the first-year number of 34,000.

Also, the company struck what was termed an "ill-advised agreement
to collect for the state (VA) an extra 35 cents from Greenway
drivers getting on the Dulles toll road."  The idea was to spare
drivers the inconvenience of paying $1.75 at the Freeway toll plaza
and then stopping a half-mile later to pay the additional 35 cents.
The psychological effect, however, has been to make Greenway tolls
seem even higher than they are (a total of $2.10 for both roads).

At a mid-December meeting in New York City, Michael Crane, CEO of
the Greenway company, reportedly asked creditors to be patient
while the company conducted the marketing survey it should have
done previously and determines what changes to make in the toll.
He hoped lower tolls would attract riders who aren't using the road
now and added that changes will be made after the survey is
completed.

One Washington transportation researcher told the Post there needs
to be an off-peak discount.  "I'm surprised they haven't already
done that," he said.

MEETINGS

ITS America Ready
to Roll in Houston

The 1996 ITS America (400 Virginia Ave. S.W., Suite
800, Washington, DC 20024-2730; Tel: 202/484-4847)
Sixth Annual Meeting and Exposition is just "around the
corner."  Scheduled for April 15-18, at the George R.
Brown Convention Center in Houston, TX, the meeting
is expected to draw some 5,000 industry and government
executives, scientists and engineers, academicians,
researchers and other transportation professionals from
this country and overseas.

Featuring the theme, Realizing the Benefits, the event
will focus on the value of advanced communications,
electronic, and computer technologies in surface
transportation.

For the first time, special segments of the Annual
Meeting and exhibitor profiles will be broadcast by
satellite to local ITS decision makers around the country.
Combined with live uplinks from operational ITS sites
throughout the U.S., the broadcast will bring the national
ITS program directly to stakeholders unable to attend the
Houston meeting.

For those who will be there, a number of facility site
tours will be available, including NASA's Johnson Space
Center.  Actually, much of the ITS technology now used
in surface transportation was originally developed for the
aerospace and defense industries.

The overall program will consist of some 70 sessions
involving more than 320 panelists and presenters.


IRF Takes the
High Road

The International Road Federation (IRF) will be holding
its 13th World Meeting in Toronto from June 16-20,
1997.  The theme of the gathering is, Roads - Enhancing
the Economy, Sustaining the Environment.  While this
event will be taking place well over a year from now,
abstracts of technical presentations are due on April 1,
1996.

The program will cover the environmental and economic
impacts of transportation, transport planning, safety, road
design, ITS and innovations.  Among the more specific
discussion topics to be examined within these sessions are
High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) programs, driver
security, Electronic Toll Collection (ETC), safety
management systems, privatization, international
standards and new pavement technologies.

More information can be obtained from Graham Jones
(Tel: 416/235-4679), manager, technical program, Ministry
of Transportation, 1201 Wilson Ave., Downview, Ontario,

NATIONS SEEK 'PRIVATE' FUNDS
FOR LYON-TURIN HSR ROUTE 

  French and Italian authorities reinforced their support 
for the proposed high speed rail link between Lyon and Turin 
this month. The two governments have established an 
intergovernmental commission to push the project forward 
this year. Project officials claim the planning is currently 
on schedule, with an estimated completion date for the 
entire link of 2002.

  The intergovernmental commission "will study the 
possibility of financing the project," explains Maurizio 
Cavagnaro, president of Alpetunnel, the European economic 
interest group set up at the end of 1994 to coordinate the 
main tunnel section of the Lyon-Turin rail link. The group 
now involves representatives of seven ministries from each 
of the two countries, he says.

  As well as the strengthening of the commission from both 
sides, the project was highlighted by the French transport 
ministry (Ministere de l'Equipement, des Transports et du 
Tourisme, or METT) earlier this month as a possible lead 
candidate for private financing. In an interview with Le 
Monde, Anne-Marie Idrac, a junior French transport minister, 
suggested that the finance for the high speed line 
construction between Lyon in southern France and Turin in 
northern Italy may be the best option available for private 
investors to get involved in rail infrastructure projects.

  Up until now, the French government has resisted almost 
all calls from the European Commission (EC) and others to 
encourage private investors to support major rail -- or any 
other -- infrastructure projects. Idrac's assertions earlier 
this month were brought on in part as a result of the strike 
by French national railways (Societe Nationale des Chemins 
de Fer, or SNCF) late last year. Whatever the prompt, her 
remarks have been greeted with relief in Brussels.

  But how far is the French government prepared to go with 
private financing? This is a confusing issue, partly because 
"private" in the private finance term does not have the same 
meaning or implication in each European country, notes one 
senior rail industry observer. "The word is used very 
loosely" in France, he adds.

  When the French ministry and SNCF say private finance, 
they mean "a contribution from the interested regions who 
would get guaranteed bank loans," the observer explains. For 
the French side of the Lyon-Turin link, this would primarily 
involve the Rhone-Alpes region. They would then be able to 
"capture the development benefit directly," he adds.

  Cavagnaro, who splits his time between the Italian 
Railways (Ferrovie dello Stato, or FS) facility in Rome and 
the Alpetunnel offices in Chambery, France, is not surprised 
by the move to consider private finance for transport 
projects. Transport ministry officials from France and Italy 
"said at a meeting one year ago" that there were financial 
constraints at the two national rail operators, he says. As 
a result, that meeting concluded that for the trans-Alpine 
link, "construction of the new line will be in a concession 
in order to involve private money," he adds.

  But "that's only a first indication," Cavagnaro says. "Now 
the question will be studied by the intergovernmental 
commission and be studied by Alpetunnel to examine all the 
possibilities of the private and public partnership," he 
adds.

  The exact model to be used for financing the project has 
yet to be finalized. The whole project is expected to cost 
approximately ECU13.55 billion ($17.3 billion), of which 
more than ECU3 billion will be for the main tunnel section 
(see HST News, Nov. 13, 1995). The "Eurotunnel idea" is one 
option under consideration, Cavagnaro says.

  But given the financial fiascos surrounding the Channel 
Tunnel initiative since its inception, it would seem 
unlikely if this model were followed too closely for the 
Alpine project. Indeed, a document published by Alpetunnel 
draws comparisons with the Channel Tunnel. The so-called 
Tunnel de Base under the Alps "shall be slightly longer than 
the tunnel under the Channel," it notes. But "in spite of a 
geological site far more complex than that of the Channel, 
the provisional cost of the tunnel is less."

  "The intergovernmental commission will be operating now in 
January, and I think the end of this year it will be 
possible to report to the two governments" on the 
recommended financing model to follow, Cavagnaro says. 
Assuming it is a concession, as initially concluded by 
representatives from the two governments, "the concession 
will be in place maybe in 1998," he adds.

  The French transport ministry is still only lukewarm at 
best on the possibilities of private investors wanting to 
get involved in track construction projects. Idrac has 
indicated that the government may help out SNCF on some 
construction projects, while leaving the private finance 
door ajar.

  Within the French ministry, "there is a subset of young 
Turks who try to loosen things up" with regard to financing 
options, the rail industry observer comments. But if SNCF 
and the METT are to go down the private investment track, 
"there is a legal step" necessary in France in order to 
"loosen the shackles," he adds.

  The Lyon-Turin high speed rail project is one of the 14 
European transport priority projects. It is described in EC 
documents as one of the "key links" in the European high 
speed network, primarily connecting Lyon through Turin, 
Milan and Venice to Trieste in the north east of Italy. For 
the key link, however, the majority of the work is required 
on the French side of the project.

  The new line in France -- a dedicated passenger rail 
facility -- will link Lyon with Montmelian. Clearly the most 
expensive sections of the project will be the Belledonne 
Tunnel from Montmelian to St Jean de Maurienne, and then the 
main 54 km (33 mile) Tunnel de Base continuing on to Susa 
over -- or rather under -- the Italian border, capable of 
taking freight and high speed passenger rail services in 
parallel.

  "The project is going ahead" and some of the first main 
construction decisions are already being made, Cavagnaro 
says. "The first problems are the decisions for construction 
of the test tunnels. These are very important works," he 
stresses. "There are three test tunnels to study the 
geology," he explains. Two of these will be in France, with 
the other in Italy. "We have started the project of the 
civil works" for the test tunnels. "At the end of this year 
will be the start of construction of the test tunnels," he 
adds.

  The French and Italian governments approved an FF800 
million ($200 million) study program for the Alpine tunnel 
at the end of 1994. Approximately one quarter of this was 
allocated for work carried out last year. In addition, the 
EC has granted the Lyon-Turin project ECU9.0 million for 
feasibility study support.

AMTRAK SCALES BACK
NEC ORDER SIZE;
FEBRUARY DECISION DUE

  Bending to the constraints caused by a lack of capital 
funding in fiscal year 1996, Amtrak's Board of Directors has 
approved plans to order just 18 high speed train sets for 
the Northeast Corridor (NEC), with an option for two 
additional fossil-fuel units.

  Amtrak has repeatedly insisted it had no plans to reduce 
the number from 26 train sets, despite reports from sources 
inside the company that it would be forced to do so (see HST 
News, Nov. 13, 1995).

  Amtrak officials decline to say whether pressure from the 
two competing consortia triggered any reduction in the 
proposed purchase.

  The Board of Directors now is expected to select a winning 
consortium next month, choosing either Siemens 
Transportation Systems or the GEC Alsthom/Bombardier team. 
ABB Traction was dismissed by Amtrak from further 
negotiations last month (see HST News, Dec. 25, 1995).

  Amtrak spokeswoman Erin Clarke acknowledges that the 
company now hopes to obtain just 18 train sets. "The number 
of train sets is 18, and we're in final negotiations," 
Clarke says. "We'll be awarding the contract in February." 
Amtrak expects an initial delivery of 12 HSR trains by 
October 1999, and "two of those 12 would be prototype train 
sets that would be delivered in 1998 for testing."

  Fiscal constraints finally forced Amtrak to reduce its 
projected equipment order, Clarke acknowledges. "Of course, 
Congress has been very supportive of the train set program, 
but has not appropriated funds for it this year [fiscal year 
1996]," Clarke notes. "We've had great support -- but 
support doesn't buy train sets." Amtrak must move ahead 
using previous federal appropriations and possible vendor 
financing, she says.

  The prototypes must be tested at the Association of 
American Railroad's (AAR) Transportation Test Center (TTC) 
in Pueblo, Colo. Asked if TTC delays could postpone the 
introduction of the new trains on the NEC still more, Clarke 
says it's not likely. "A lot of the testing will take place 
in Pueblo," she says, but delays are unlikely because "so 
many folks" will be involved. Paradoxically, the range of 
tests, including anything from noise to the comfort of 
internal amenities, will be so intense "that we don't 
anticipate any problems."

  Clarke unveiled Amtrak's revised plan Jan. 7 to a sparsely 
attended session on high speed rail during the recent 
Transportation Research Board (TRB) annual meeting in 
Washington, D.C., whose attendance was severely impacted by 
blizzard-like weather. "There were almost no presenters from 
our group, except myself," she quips.

  Clarke adds that, contrary to rumors that surfaced at TRB, 
Amtrak is still exploring the purchase of non-electrified 
fossil fuel alternatives to HSR. "The fossil fuel train sets 
-- the two -- remain in as an option, and we'll exercise 
that contingent on funding," she says.

  Not all TRB members are reassured by Clarke's pledge. 
George Haikalis, a New York City-based consultant, says the 
fossil fuel order now falls "at the end of the option, not 
at the end of the initial order. That puts it in jeopardy, 
puts it at risk.

  "The number of trains, whether 24 or 18, is fine, but they 
ought to all be fossil fuel, to get something up and running 
right now," Haikalis observers. "We're talking three million 
person hours of delay just to accomplish what we could 
accomplish sooner, at lower cost and less inconvenience."

  Haikalis says Amtrak is correct to focus its resources on 
one HSR project, rather than spread a limited pool of funds 
across the country, diluting any impact. But using the NEC 
for fossil-fuel R&D, he says, not only is better and more 
cost-effective, "but they'd be advancing a technology that 
would have widespread application throughout the U.S. in the 
'Accelerail' program."

  "Amtrak and FRA may want to be sacrificing this to reduce 
the credibility of alternatives to electrification," 
Haikalis charges. "Everything must be sacrificed on the 
altar of electrification."

  Amtrak rejects Haikalis's accusations. "If Mr. Haikalis is 
correct, why is 90 percent of Europe's highly acclaimed 
passenger rails system electrified?" says Amtrak director of 
media relations Clifford Black. "And why aren't they 
instituting fossil fuel replacements?"

  Adds Clarke, "Most of our trains are running on non-
electrified territory; we have every interest in developing 
a train that would be appropriate. We certainly haven't 
abandoned the fossil-fuel option," Clarke declares. "But in 
the entire nation, this [the NEC] is the market where we can 
truly dominate."

  Amtrak still may add to its order of 18 trains, Clarke 
points out. "We got approval from the Board to move forward 
with 18 train sets, but I don't think that means Amtrak 
won't obtain 19, 20, 21 sets or whatever."

  Efforts on Capitol Hill are still underway to secure a 
dedicated capital funding source for the railroad, though 
the proposal has been stymied by the budget debate. "If we 
get the half-penny gas tax, the number of equipment sets 
could change," says Black. "Regardless of our near-term 
capital situation, it can be assumed that a successful 18 
set order could be easily expanded, if warranted and if 
money is available."

  Black says the initial order of 18 sets will be sufficient 
to serve the entire NEC adequately, once electrification is 
extended from New Haven, Conn. to Boston. He also says the 
decision date for awarding a contract, which has slipped 
repeatedly through 1995 is now firm. "The Board will make 
its decision in February," Black says.

  "There continues to be give and take between Amtrak and 
the remaining vendors on various details of the contract, 
including but not limited to financing and servicing 
requirements. We concede that it has been a very long 
siege," Black says. "The process has proved more complicated 
than anticipated."

  NEC electrification, also repeatedly delayed, is now set 
to begin under a new contractor team headed by Balfour 
Beatty Power Construction, Inc. and Massachusetts Electric 
Construction Co. Amtrak had planned to hold a groundbreaking 
ceremony in early spring, with full construction underway by 
summer. "We're still planning a June 1996 groundbreaking 
with full mobilization at the same time. But I don't think 
we're planning a ceremonial groundbreaking."

AMTRAK DEFENDS 
DECISION TO DROP 
ABB TRACTION

  Partisans of X-2000 tilt train technology have protested 
Amtrak's decision last month to discontinue negotiations 
with ABB Traction, Inc., one of three finalists vying for 
Amtrak's NEC equipment order. Amtrak reportedly dropped ABB 
from consideration due to higher cost estimates.

  But Amtrak director of media relations Clifford Black says 
Amtrak's decision was not, in and of itself, a rejection of 
the X-2000. "We're frustrated in dealing with the continued 
belief, and myth, that this is somehow a competition between 
the X-2000, as we know it, the ICE train as we know it, and 
the TGV as we know it," Black says.

  Black notes "we have received letters from people 
protesting [dropping the X-2000] because those people 
thought it was an excellent train. We liked it too, and 
thought it was an excellent train." But Amtrak's 
specifications call for a distinct product tailored to U.S. 
needs. "We're not buying an off-the- shelf train."

  Some letters addressed to Amtrak suggest "we have cast off 
an American-made X-2000 and are now negotiating with German 
and Canadian companies. The irony is, regardless of who is 
awarded the contract, the provision calling for substantial 
American content remains the same," Black says.

  "This is not a vote of no-confidence for the X-2000. This 
is an Amtrak train designed to incorporate features and 
characteristics that we feel will best suit our needs."

DG VII SHIFTS FOCUS
FROM RAIL IN 2ND CALL,
BUT TASKS STRESS HSR  

  Rail research has moved right down the priority list for 
the second Fourth Framework call for proposals from DG VII 
at the European Commission (EC). The transport directorate 
in Brussels is looking to allocate around ECU4.5 million 
($5.7 million) to selected rail research bids due to be 
submitted by the March 15 deadline.

  The low figure this time round is partly due to the 
success of rail companies in bidding for funds on offer in 
the first call for proposals. Rail has been allocated 16 
percent of the program's overall budget of ECU256 million 
for projects running in the period 1995 through 1998 (see 
HST News, Jan. 23, 1995). But rail bids secured over two 
thirds of this allocation from the first round of bidding -- 
primarily thanks to the coordination of most of these by 
Union Internationale des Chemins de Fer (UIC) -- leaving 
just ECU13 million for rail projects in the second and third 
calls.

  Despite the low budget on offer, there are 30 tasks 
directly related to rail which are open for DG VII's second 
call for proposals, issued on Dec. 15 (see chart page 8). 
But while rail proposers are likely to have to fight over 
just ECU4.5 million, there are other sections of the program 
which should have some rail elements.

  The strategic research section of DG VII's program 
accounts for 20 percent of the overall budget. In the second 
call, this program section is in line for approximately 
ECU11.71 million; representing the largest share of the 
ECU48 million expected to be on offer.

  In addition, the program section covering integrated 
transport chains -- with a budget for this call of 
approximately ECU4.47 million -- also has a high rail 
content. All seven tasks in this section were open in the 
first call, but the transport directorate is still accepting 
bids on these during the second call for proposals.

  The transport chains section addresses primarily freight 
operations. It aims to improve freight facilities both on 
individual modes and in the interoperability between modes. 
The program section divides into tasks relating to transport 
terminals and networks. One of the main priorities 
identified in the work program relates to improved access 
for freight to rail infrastructure.

  DG VII approved 111 projects for funding from the first 
call for proposals (see HST News, Dec. 25, 1995). But, with 
some contracts not yet signed, officials from the transport 
directorate have not released details of these. The only 
exception is the integrated transport chains projects.

  Given that bids for the second call will have to make sure 
they do not overlap with those approved from the first, DG 
VII has released the list of the three projects already 
approved for funding in this section of the program, 
explains Simon Mordue, an official in the transport 
directorate. The current plan is to publish brief summaries 
of all projects -- assuming the contracts are signed -- in 
March, he adds.

  "One result of the first call was three projects on 
integrated transport chains," Mordue says. INRETS (Institut 
National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Securite) 
in Paris is leading the IQ (Intermodal quality) project. The 
consortium is planning four field trials which will aim to 
improve "operational and control functions within the 
network and the terminals," according to the additional 
information documents released by DG VII as part of the work 
program.

  The Impulse (Interoperable modular pilot plants underlying 
the logistics systems in Europe) project, led by the German 
firm Krupp Fordertechnik, will address "trans-shipment 
facilities and the related terminal organization." PLS 
Consult, based in Arhus, Denmark, is the coordinator of the 
Freia (Towards the networking of European freight villages) 
project which is concerned with the role of smaller firms in 
intermodal transport.

  Of the 30 tasks currently open in the rail section of the 
program, eight have an element of high speed rail. The task 
description included in the work program for Task 37 
stresses the need for interoperability of high speed rail 
systems. "When analyzing the cost benefits of inter- 
operability in order to find reasonable levels one must not 
only consider the short term views but also the longer term 
effects especially taking account of the fact that inter- 
operable advanced (telematics) technology is very cost 
effective," it states.

  Seven tasks under the title "future rail freight and 
passenger management" are included in the current call for 
proposals, all with reference to high speed rail. DG VII 
officials indicate that "all the tasks 44 to 50 could form 
one project or they could be split up on a few different 
projects."

  "With the construction of high speed rail lines the 
possible use of these lines also for freight services should 
be considered," says the work program, which has had some 
minor modifications since it was first issued in December 
1994, states.

  The set of tasks on "future" issues ends with a pragmatic 
assessment of the potential for high speed rail. The task 
"is intended to deal with finding the optimum solution in 
the area of compromise between speed, comfort and costs on 
lines which are not obvious candidates for dedicated high 
speed services," according to the work program.

  The majority of the 111 projects selected in the first 
wave of DG VII's new program have finally got down to work 
this month. Proposers hoping for a share of the second call 
budget can expect to have to start work in autumn, at which 
time DG VII is currently planning to release its third and 
final call for proposals in the Fourth Framework.

  DG VII has pushed its open information policy in setting 
up the new program -- its largest Framework R&D effort by 
far. As well as having sent out paper-based information 
packs to tens of thousands of prospective proposers over the 
last year, the directorate's information has been available 
electronically. Close to 5,000 sets of documents have been 
distributed in this way, Mordue says.

  Up to date information will soon be available via an on-
line service. "We're just finalizing a home page on the 
World Wide Web," Mordue says. Until this is established, 
further details on DG VII's Fourth Framework plans can be 
accessed through http://www.cordis.lu.

GIRDERS AND PROPULSION
CHANGES AS TRANSRAPID
PREPARES FOR MORE TESTS

  Officials from the Transrapid consortium are completing a 
series of upgrades to the high speed maglev facility in 
Emsland, Germany. One of the main changes concerns the 
propulsion system for the Transrapid. The "new generation" 
currently being installed should now stay the same through 
to installation on the Berlin-Hamburg line.

  Testing of the new propulsion system is scheduled to start 
in March or April, says Rudiger Fuerst, the project manager 
for Siemens AG Transportation Systems Group within 
Transrapid in Erlangen, Germany. The modifications have 
required "new inverters and new rectifiers. This is now the 
type we want to use in the project Berlin-Hamburg," he adds.

  To accommodate the synchronous motors required by the 
Transrapid, "we have to construct a special power supply," 
Fuerst explains. Since the system works by varying the 
current and the frequency, "we have to use inverters" which 
can change the frequency between zero and 270 Hz. "To use 
this inverter, we need rectifiers to convert" from the 50 Hz 
mains supply to DC.

  But it is not just the propulsion system which is being 
modified following the initial tests on the 31.5 km test 
track. "The test facility has been upgraded," notes Manfred 
Wackers, head of marketing and system applications at 
Transrapid International in Munich. Since the first phase of 
testing, "the system has been further improved," he adds.

  With prototype Transrapids being tested at speeds in 
excess of 400 km/h, there have been reports of wear and tear 
on some sections of the guideway. That is "right and wrong," 
Wackers observes. "We have different types of girders" 
holding up the guideway along the test track for evaluation 
purposes. It was planned from the outset that "not all of 
these would be used in construction," he adds.

  Officials from Transrapid -- a joint venture of ABB 
Daimler-Benz Transportation Systems, Siemens and Thyssen 
Henschel Maglev Transportation Technology (Magnetfahrtech- 
nik) -- have identified three girder types which could be of 
use on different sections of the Berlin-Hamburg route. These 
are constructed from "concrete, steel as well as a combined 
technology," Wackers says.

  While the new propulsion tests will not start for a few 
months, the Emsland track is currently being used to assess 
passenger comfort issues. Transrapids have been running on 
the track at speeds of up to 425 km/h with passengers on 
board, Wackers says. "Even those who are opposed to the 
system, they are convinced" once they have been on a test 
run, he claims.

  For the Berlin-Hamburg line, "construction will start in 
1998," as planned, says Wackers, originally from the Thyssen 
side of the Transrapid group. "The legal planning phases" 
are continuing, but "we are making progress," he notes. The 
intention is that this "will be accomplished by the middle 
of 1996."

  The whole consortium is involved in carrying out the 
necessary assessments, Fuerst says. These cover issues such 
as energy consumption, noise levels, and land requirements 
both for the track and for the power supply facilities.

  Some of the tests as part of this assessment have 
indicated that in a few situations Transrapid can meet noise 
regulations "without building a noise wall, even if the 
guideway is only a couple of meters away, at speeds of 200 
km/h," Wackers says. A more typical spacing may be closer to 
10 meters.

  The proposed route is "nearly 300 km in length, so you 
need three to four years in the planning process," Wackers 
notes. "Planning for Berlin-Hamburg is now in the detailed 
planning phase," he says. It has reached the stage where the 
local and national authorities are trying "to find the right 
locations for the stations in the cities. Different 
alternatives are being evaluated," he adds.

  The decision on whether the line will extend to the 
proposed new airport in Berlin has still to be finalized 
(see HST News, June 12, 1995). This is "an option," Wackers 
says. But the authorities still "don't know where the 
location [of the airport] might be." This should finally be 
sorted out some time later this year. The next stage in the 
planning process will aim to compile some "concrete cost 
findings into the economics of the whole project again," he 
says.

  While the main testing should be completed within the next 
year, the test track will not be closed down. "We think we 
will need this test facility until the project Berlin-
Hamburg works," Fuerst says. This is likely to be eight 
years from now.

  In addition to Siemens, Thyssen Henschel Magnetfahrtechnik 
and ABB, the Transrapid group also includes Dyckerhoff 
Widmann, Hochtief, Philipp Holzmann and Deutsche Bahn.

1995: NEW WORKS AND
R&D RISE IN EUROPE;
NORTH AMERICA FADES

  Squabbles over the formation of European Union (EU) often 
obscured the substantial ongoing progress within Europe's 
rapidly expanding high speed transport network. As 1995 
began, several HSR route additions were being constructed, 
more were being planned, most were assured of some funding 
support, and even one high speed commercial maglev project  
-- the world's first -- made substantial gains.

  Among Asian nations, South Korea looked to add two more 
HSR lines to supplement its initial route, while Malaysia 
worked to attract European equipment manufacturers. Japan 
intensified its efforts to market its well-tested Shinkansen 
HSR technology for export, and evaluated that technology's 
performance after a devastating earthquake shook Kobe Jan. 
17. West Japan Railways (WJR) service was disrupted, but WJR 
infrastructure held up better than nearby highway elevated 
construction and equipment damage was judged to be minor.

  Though no comparable earthquake jolted North America, both 
Canada and the United States fell further behind in HST 
development. Both Florida and Washington state advanced 
individual HSR programs to compensate for the lack of 
interest within the U.S. federal government. Canada's long-
delayed HSR study, finally released, suggested North 
America's largest nation would play no part at all in the 
HSR universe.

  Fiscal woes surrounding the Channel Tunnel's business 
operations all but overshadowed the steady presence of its 
everyday rail operations, including the rise of Eurostar HSR 
service as a dominant carrier between London and Paris. As 
the summer arrived, Le Shuttle tourist trains through the 
Chunnel also began attracting increased passenger loads, 
although Le Shuttle's on-time performance struggled to meet 
targeted projections.

  Eurostar's marketing success highlighted the triumph of 
one more TGV variant manufactured by HSR leader GEC Alsthom. 
But the Paris-based company faced some tough competition in 
1995, as more nations joined the HSR club, and many chose 
technology other than top-speed TGV designs.

  Early in the year, Norwegian State Railway (Norges 
Statsbaner) opted for 16 electric multiple-units (EMUs) 
modifications of ABB Traction, Inc.'s X-2000 tilt train. The 
order was the first equipment export success for Vasteras, 
Sweden-based ABB, though it dominates its own domestic 
market. (ABB's tentative dismissal by Amtrak later last year 
only increases the corporation's stake in the Norwegian 
order.)

  Siemens AG Transportation Systems Group, the Berlin-based 
maker of InterCity Express (ICE) equipment, also scored its 
first export sales triumph, and also through a neighboring 
country -- the Netherlands. Netherlands Railways 
(Nederlandse Spoorwegen) officials opted for six new Siemens 
ICE 2/2 lightweight HSR train sets to link Amsterdam with 
Frankfurt and Berlin.

  Savigliano, Italy-based Fiat Ferroviaria had its own 
export success, as Finnish State Railways (Valtiorautatiet) 
accepted two Pendolino S200 tilt train sets for that 
nation's first HSR route, a 150 km (94 mile) line between 
Helsinki and Turku. Valtiorautatiet initiated HSR service 
late in the year, following conventional service upgrades 
and HSR testing along the route.

  In a joint effort, both Siemens and Fiat Ferroviaria 
combined forces with two Czech firms to supply 10 HSR EMU 
train sets to Czech Railways (Ceske Drahy). The order 
bolstered Fiat's role as the dominant supplier of tilt train 
technology within Europe, and highlighted the Siemens/Fiat 
partnership being applied to other projects, including 
Amtrak's Northeast Corridor (NEC). The order also added the 
Czech Republic to the potential list of HSR nations, making 
the nation potentially the first former East Bloc country to 
join the European HSR club.

  Siemens' 1995 success was not limited to just HSR, as it 
and several other domestic firms continued to advance 
Germany's long-range plan for the world's first high speed 
commercial maglev service. Revised plans in 1995 added city 
center access to Berlin as part of the mix, with officials 
of Transrapid Planning Corporation GmbH scouting several 
through-city rights-of-way for use to and through the 
nation's capital. The extension of the original DM8.9 
billion ($6.3 billion), 283 kilometer (175 mile) route could 
open up better intermodal opportunities with Berlin's U-Bahn 
and S-Bahn services, as well as steel-wheel HST operations. 
Transrapid's current Hamburg-Berlin route has been 
criticized by industry observers for its inferior Berlin 
terminus at Westkreuz (West Cross) Station, which offers 
skeletal intermodal links.

  In midyear, officials from the state of Brandenburg added 
another proposal to the maglev project: a connection to a 
new international airport now being proposed for the city. 
Berlin city officials were skeptical of the proposal, which 
would recycle Sperenberg Air Base south of the city, 
recently closed at part of the withdrawal of the Soviet army 
following Germany's unification.

  The European Commission (EC), struggling to make itself 
effective, continued advancing two directorates in the 
transport field last year, with HSR high on the list of 
priorities. Estimates produced in Brussels last year point 
to a spend of ECU240 billion ($303 billion) for the 
infrastructure and rolling stock required to complete the 
high speed rail sections of the trans-European transport 
network. The EC's transport directorate (DG VII) has lined 
up ECU2.05 billion for the period 1993-1999, but there are 
other options through, for example, the European Investment 
Bank.

  On the research side, DG VII selected 111 projects for the 
first phase of its new ECU256 million program within the 
Fourth Framework. Overall, rail is expected to receive 16 
percent of this budget over the next four years, with the 
European Rail Transport Management System (ERTMS) high on 
the agenda. Also on the transport side, DG VII approved 
ECU240 million in 1995 to support the 14 priority transport 
projects, many of which concern high speed rail.

  Elsewhere at the Brussels administration, the telematics 
directorate (DG XIII) garnered less attention within the 
rail community. DG XIII targets more funding to roadways 
than rail, but several rail proposals survive, including the 
Railway Open System Interconnection Network (Rosin). 
Nonetheless, roads remain the dominant mode within DG XIII, 
according to former director generale Michel Carpentier.

  Amtrak ended 1995 just as it began it: preparing to order 
train sets to provide high speed rail service to its 
Northeast Corridor (NEC) between Washington, D.C. and 
Boston. Amtrak began 1995 hoping to select one of three 
competing consortia "in the spring." By year's end, the 
railroad had effectively eliminated ABB Traction, Inc. from 
the competition, but still had to choose between two 
consortia led by Siemens Transportation Systems and GEC 
Alsthom/Bombardier Corp., respectively. Amtrak's newest 
deadline for the decision is set for February, with industry 
observers becoming weary marking the delays.

  Meanwhile, leadership within the new Republican Congress 
gave Amtrak a two-pronged message: (1) do more with less; 
and (2) don't emphasize the NEC and HSR at the expense of 
other long-distance intercity services.

  Amtrak also marked time in extending electrification of 
the NEC north of New Haven, Conn. to Boston, in part due to 
the withdrawal of Morrison-Knudsen Corp. as the prime 
contractor for the project.

  Though Florida's Department of Transportation (FDOT) 
finally pulled the plug on the ill-fated Orlando maglev 
project in early January, FDOT moved aggressively to attract 
private sector interest for an HST network linking Miami, 
Orlando and Tampa. By year's end, five consortia -- three 
HSR entries and two maglev proposals -- were submitted to 
the state, seeking to tap FDOT's guarantee of $70 million in 
state funds available each year for the next 25 years.

  A more modest $40 million program in Washington State was 
advanced to establish incremental HSR between Portland, 
Ore., Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., using leased Talgo 
passive tilt train equipment. Washington DOT officials 
released their own request for proposals late in the year to 
lease/purchase two non-electric HSR trains, with Madrid-
based Patentes Talgo, S.A. given the edge in any 
competition.

  If the United States symbolized the downsizing of HSR 
ambitions in North America, Canada represented full-scale 
retreat. The Quebec/Windsor High Speed Rail feasibility 
study, begun in 1992, essentially declared HSR too expensive 
for the nation's needs, and thus unjustified to receive 
federal funds. But controversy surfaced when the 89-page 
study's conclusion, supported by the federal government, was 
disputed by the study's two other partners, particularly the 
province of Quebec.

  Critics also noted the feasibility study predictably 
endorsed TGV HSR service for the route, should the national 
will be found to finance it, and drew a link between the 
endorsement and the role of Canada's Bombardier, Inc. in 
marketing TGV technology for North America. ABB Traction, 
Inc. publicly questioned the study's dismissal of lower-
speed, tilt-technology trains for the route, noting Amtrak's 
NEC plans included tilt-train capabilities.

  North America's HSR travails were mirrored by those of 
associations like the High Speed Rail/Maglev Association 
(HSR/MLA), which tried to remain relevant in spite of 
dwindling federal financial and political support for high-
speed options. HSR/MLA president Joseph Vranich, credited 
with highlighting HST opportunities in the U.S., abruptly 
resigned from his position early in the year, leaving a 
leadership void for much of 1995 and an annual meeting held 
in Boston during the spring that sought to determine what 
the future held for both the organization and North American 
HST.

  By contrast, European HST interests, led by the European 
Commission (EC), the Union Inter- nationale des Chemins de 
Fer (UIC), and others, held the Eurailspeed Second World 
Congress on High-Speed Rail last fall, spotlighting the rise 
of Lille, France, as a high speed rail and intermodal 
transport hub. The attitude was upbeat, reflecting a growing 
belief that European nations, led by the EU, would expand 
HSR opportunities.

FRA SUMMARY FINDS
MAGLEV DISMISSED,
HSR PREFERRED

  The Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) High Speed 
Ground Transportation Policy Outreach summary, compiling 
public comment from eight public meetings held in 1995 
throughout the U.S., suggests that incremental improvements 
to passenger rail may be the best policy course, at least in 
the eyes of those who testified.

  Those testifying at the hearings, perhaps predictably, 
were generally in favor of high speed transport, whether HSR 
or maglev, as opposed to continuing existing federal 
priorities which appear to favor road or air. But only one 
of the eight meetings -- in Albany, N.Y. -- registered any 
substantial support for maglev development, according to the 
FRA findings.

  The 23 page (plus appendix) FRA report also touched on 
funding issues, HST as part of a National Highway System 
(NHS), the role of ISTEA in funding HSR, state funding 
options, and the role of Amtrak in any U.S. HST future.

  The HSGT Policy Outreach will be used in conjunction with 
FRA's ongoing Commercial Feasibility Study (CFS), both 
mandated by ISTEA, "to determine where and what types of 
High Speed Ground Transportation makes sense in the United 
States." The CFS study, originally due for submission to 
Congress last September, now is scheduled to be completed by 
this spring (see HST News, July 24, 1995).

  Besides Albany, N.Y., FRA held meetings in Richmond, Va., 
Portland, Ore., Sacramento, Calif., Orlando, Fla., Chicago 
and New Orleans. An eighth meeting was held in conjunction 
with the 12th annual meeting of the High Speed Rail/Maglev 
Association (HSR/MLA) in Boston.

  "While there were several references to 'real high speed 
rail' with speeds of greater than 150 miles per hour, most 
participants focused on the short-term goals of increasing 
speeds to 90, 110 and 125 miles per hour." the FRA report 
says.

  "Maglev was mentioned infrequently," it adds pointedly. 
"The New York State Department of Transportation reported 
that their 'long term goal is to evaluate the feasibility of 
offering very high speed service (up to 300 mph) using 
Maglev technology between major urban centers.' The Florida 
Department of Transportation is open to consideration of any 
HSGT technology, including Maglev, for the Miami-Orlando-
Tampa corridor. Other participants, however, expressed 
reservations about the feasibility of Maglev." FRA notes 
that in New York, the Empire State Passengers Association 
(ESPA), a citizens group, protested the high cost relative 
to the modest cost savings that maglev would offer over HSR 
in the state's Empire Corridor linking Buffalo, Albany and 
New York City.

  In Portland, Ore., one of ESPA's counterparts, the 
Association of Oregon Rail and Transit Advocates, argued 
that "HSGT should be able to directly compete with NHS 
highways in the same corridor for the same Federal funds." 
The FRA report notes speakers from the Pacific Northwest 
enthusiastically supported HSR opportunities for the 
region's Cascadia Corridor, running from Portland through 
Seattle to Vancouver, B.C.

  ISTEA funding for HST was also advocated as a capital 
source. A statement by the National Association of Railroad 
Passengers (NARP) declared "the Federal government should 
provide the same opportunities for investment in high-speed 
(and conventional) rail as it does for aviation and 
highways."

  FRA briefly but crisply notes the "universal agreement 
that the Federal Government needs to take the lead in 
defining safety standards for HSGT and in developing the 
technology of other low cost alternatives to grade 
separation or crossing closures." FRA Administrator Jolene 
M. Molitoris has made safety a priority concern for the 
agency, and has focused on grade crossing safety as an 
essential component of her campaign.

  [In a speech before the Transportation Research Board in 
Washington, D.C. on Jan. 10, Transportation Secretary 
Federico F. Pena included rail grade crossing safety as the 
sole rail component of a nine point plan for Intelligent 
Transportation Infrastructure (ITI). The ITI plan would be 
included in the U.S. Department of Transportation's 
Operation TimeSaver, designed to speed travel in the 21st 
century. Pena cited the October bus/rail collision in Fox 
River Grove, Ill. as "a wake-up call on the importance of 
linking systems." Other rail issues, including HST, were not 
addressed by Pena in the speech, however.]

  Federal priority was also urged to override state and 
local regulations that, by chance or design, preclude HST 
development. FRA notes that even Amtrak's Northeast Corridor 
(NEC), an existing HSR route, has been blocked by opponents 
of electrification; the study says one speaker testified 
that "incentives should be offered to states for eliminating 
restrictive regulations and procedures that slow the 
implementation" of HST.

  Proponents of "gateway technologies," including non-
electric HSR development and positive train control (PTC) 
systems, were well represented at the various sessions. The 
FRA found "widespread support for efforts to develop a new 
non-electric locomotive, a positive train control system, 
and positive barriers for grade crossings. However, there is 
concern that FRA not reinvent existing European and Japanese 
technology in hope of establishing a US rail manufacturing 
industry. Many participants believe that effort to create a 
new industry could unduly delay the implementation of HSGT 
programs. Rather than develop new train set technology, 
participants urged the FRA to facilitate the importation of 
European technology through the establishment of standards 
that are compatible with the International Railway Union 
(UIC) standards."

  But FRA also noted, "Incremental improvements are being 
designed to benefit all potential users of the rail system" 
in each region where it held hearings. "Emphasis is also 
being placed on expanding the reach of the rail systems, by 
linking areas that could feed the high speed rail line. The 
goal behind these efforts, in all cases, is to create a 
stronger market for HSGT by improving the level of service 
currently being offered.

  "Success stories were cited in every region, demonstrating 
savings in travel time and other effects of improving train 
speeds, frequency, and reliability on ridership levels, as 
well as on public support for new rail systems," the summary 
said.

  * The decision on which of the two remaining bidders will 
be selected for the construction of the U.K. Channel tunnel 
rail link is anticipated within the next few days. Reports 
over the holiday period noted that the announcement by the 
U.K. Department of Transport (DOT) would be expected in 
early February. At press time, DOT officials noted that the 
announcement was expected "shortly."

  The construction plan has already been put back, however, 
with a completion date now set in the early part of 2003, 
six months later than scheduled. The route from London to 
the Channel Tunnel is 68 miles long. The two consortia, one 
of which will also take over the operation of Eurostar, are: 
London and Continental Railways, including Virgin, Ove Arup 
and Partners, SG Warburg and Bechtel; and Eurorail, with 
BICC, Trafalgar House HSBC and National Westminster Bank.

  Contracts should be signed on April 1, with many U.K. rail 
industry observers tipping London and Continental as the 
likely successful bid. But with Eurostar's patronage for 
1995 down more than 60 percent on predictions, that may not 
be the best part of the deal. Along with the contract, the 
successful consortium will secure considerable land, some of 
which could be used for potentially lucrative real estate 
redevelopment.

  * Neil Kinnock, the European transport commissioner, has 
set out his stall for European transport policy over the 
coming years with the publication of the green paper 
"Towards fair and efficient pricing in transport." The 
report concentrates on proposing methods to level the 
playing field between the costs associated with different 
transport modes, with particular reference to methods of 
charging motorists for roads at the point of use.

  "Measures should be taken to review policies to establish 
fairer competition between modes of transport," Kinnock says 
in the report's introduction. "Both rail and inland 
waterways appear to have much lower cost recovery rates than 
road haulage," the report states in setting out the case 
that road infrastructure costs are not being met. 

  Kinnock's green paper is part of the process the EC is 
going through in addressing the "internalization of external 
costs."

DOT TO PUSH ITS DEPLOYMENT
IN 75 LARGEST U.S. METRO AREAS

  Transportation Secretary Federico Pena announced a new 
initiative last week to build an "intelligent transportation 
infrastructure" (ITI) across the United States. "I want 75 
of our largest metropolitan areas outfitted with a complete 
intelligent transportation infrastructure in ten years," 
Pena said, echoing John Kennedy's call to put an American on 
the moon within a decade. Pena discussed the new ITS goal at 
the annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board 
(TRB) last Wednesday.

  Pena was scheduled to unveil the new plan on Monday, but 
the blizzard that dumped on the mid-Atlantic forced him to 
postpone his address to the TRB. In the meantime, word of 
the new initiative, dubbed "Operation TimeSaver," had 
already started trickling out. The Associated Press carried 
an item about it on Monday, and National Public Radio 
mentioned it briefly on Tuesday, although neither report 
carried much detail.

  Pena said the goal of Operation TimeSaver is to reduce 
travel time in the U.S. by at least 15 percent. To achieve 
that aim, metropolitan areas will be encouraged to implement 
an infrastructure that integrates nine component systems 
for: traffic signal control; freeway management; transit 
management; incident management; electronic toll collection 
(ETC); electronic fare payment; warnings at railroad grade 
crossings; emergency response; and multimodal traveler 
information systems.

  "There isn't a community in the country that has all 
nine," Pena said. "Atlanta comes closest, as it prepares for 
the Olympics. Many cities have some components, but the 
components aren't linked."

  In connection with Operation TimeSaver, the U.S. 
Department of Transportation (DOT) expects later this month 
to open its solicitation for two or three metropolitan areas 
to serve as model deployment sites. Plans for the 
solicitation are not new. Officials with the federal ITS 
program have been talking about it for months, though lack 
of support from Congress has forced them to vastly reduce 
the scope of that program. (see Inside ITS, Nov. 6, 1995).

  It's clear that the DOT is not looking to Congress for the 
type of dedicated funding for Operation TimeSaver that it 
hoped to win for last year's attempt at a model deployment 
program, the Trailblazer Initiative. The DOT asked for $100 
million for Trailblazer; instead, it received $10 million to 
support model deployments at the two or three sites it 
expects to choose this year.

  "There are federal dollars to help pay for this strategic 
investment," Pena said of Operation TimeSaver in his speech 
at the TRB. But these funds will not consist of new monies 
devoted to ITS initiatives. Rather, ITS is moving into the 
mainstream. "The federal aid that states receive can be used 
to build 100 percent of the infrastructure," he said. Also, 
"we must be more creative by inviting the private sector to 
play a role."

  A major task ahead of proponents of the ITI will be to 
convince state and local officials, and the public at large, 
that there are long term benefits to purchasing an ITI with 
money they might otherwise spend on concrete and steel or 
pothole repair. To that end, the DOT has formed a 
partnership with a variety of organizations to help drum up 
grass roots support. The organizations include Public 
Technologies Inc. (PTI); Public Transit; the American 
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials 
(AASHTO); the National Association of Counties; ITS America; 
the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE); the International 
Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association (IBTTA); the Surface 
Transportation Policy Project; the American Trucking 
Associations (ATA); the Highway Users Federation; and the 
National League of Cities.

  Regional offices of the Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA) also are being recruited for this effort, and 
regional employees will undergo training so that they can 
act as "missionaries," for ITS technology in the words of 
one DOT official at the TRB meeting. On Jan. 23, FHWA 
offices throughout the country will hold an "open house" to 
help introduce the program to stakeholders.

  Speaking at a Monday session, William Jones, coordinator 
of the advanced public transit systems program at the ITS 
Joint Program Office, described Operation TimeSaver 
primarily as an outreach program to deliver the message on 
the local and regional levels that ITS technology is 
available and worthy of investment. One could speculate that 
local efforts might also have a second target: legislators 
in Washington. Last year, ITS proponents scrambled to 
convince Congress that ITS is neither "corporate welfare" 
nor "science fiction." As a new round of Congressional 
appropriations begins this spring, Operation TimeSaver could 
serve as an effort to change the language of the debate. 
Pena's speech, along with brochures and a video promoting 
the program at the TRB, focused on the human benefits of 
ITS. Instead of talking about radar systems, proponents are 
trying to push the discussions back in the direction of 
systems that, for example, give parents more time to spend 
with their children.

  Although state and local transportation officials will 
need to rely on their general highway funds to build the 
ITI, the U.S. DOT has set aside money for other efforts 
meant to encourage ITS deployment. Pena used his TRB address 
to announce the award of five contracts to standards-setting 
organizations "to begin fast tracking the development" of 
ITS standards. These are AASHTO, the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), ITE, the American Society 
for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Society of 
Automotive Engineers (SAE). The money will pay for technical 
support for standards-making activities (see Inside ITS, 
Sept. 25, 1995). Pena did not mention the value of the 
contracts.

  Pena also said the DOT will make "a significant 
investment" in training DOT field personnel to deal with ITS 
technologies. Without naming the size of the investment, he 
said it will be "on the order made when we built the 
Interstate system." The training effort will be aimed at 
"expanding their technical capacity so civil engineers can 
become electronic and communication experts."

SNOW RAINS ON TRB'S
75TH ANNUAL MEETING
IN BLIZZARD-BOUND D.C.

  The Blizzard of '96 proved to be a spoiler for the 75th 
annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) in 
Washington, D.C. last week. Over 17 inches of snow and winds 
gusting up to 35 mph closed airports, roads and above-ground 
sections of the Metro. After attendance last year of about 
7,100 people and pre-registration this year of 5,000, the 
TRB was expecting a banner year. But at the end of the first 
full day of the meeting, only 2,733 intrepid souls had been 
able to get to the event.

  Rodney Slater, head of the Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA), drove a four wheel drive vehicle through the drifts 
to help deliver an annual report on ITS on Monday morning. 
Hundreds of people attended this session last year; just 
over 50 people, looking lost in a cavernous ballroom, took 
seats this year.

  But the administrator drew positive parallels with the 
first meeting, 75 years ago, of what eventually became the 
TRB. About the same number of people attended that first 
meeting, which also was held in a blizzard. Drawing a 
parallel with ITS, he said the TRB started with just a few 
people and a big idea, and it has blossomed into something 
grand.

  While Slater was talking about pathways to the future, 
Christine Johnson, the director of the ITS Joint Program 
Office (JPO) at the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), 
was doing some back-breaking path work of her own -- 
shoveling her way out of her home for five and a half hours. 
"We could have used an intelligent transportation system 
here!" she said.

  Once the blizzard hit, getting into Washington was as 
difficult for residents of nearby suburbs as for delegates 
from overseas. Early in a Monday afternoon session on 
international developments in ITS, 40 people listened to two 
speakers in the same large ballroom used for the morning's 
domestic ITS report. Six presenters and a moderator had been 
scheduled. At many sessions, the presenters who showed up 
actually were pinch-hitters. Speakers introduced both 
themselves and "who they were supposed to be." At a meeting 
of the TRB's committee on ITS on Monday evening, 26 people 
were in attendance. Jim Scott, the TRB's staff person for 
the committee, said this meeting typically draws 200-250 
people.

  Foot traffic to the exhibit hall in the Sheraton 
Washington had to be diverted because two skylights had 
broken over the main entrance to the hall. Unfortunately, 
not many visitors were able to stroll through a special "ITS 
Pavilion" festooned with banners promoting "Operation 
TimeSaver" (see story on page 1) or exhibits devoted to 
federal and state departments of transportation. Those who 
took the alternate route to the exhibit hall could relax and 
monitor outside highway conditions through feeds from the 
Montgomery County, Md. advanced transportation management 
system (ATMS). Watching the video images of roadways was 
like watching fish in an aquarium on cable TV. Highways that 
are usually filled bumper-to-bumper with cars were serenely 
empty. An occasional vehicle would slowly float across the 
screen as a gentle snow continued to fall over the 
Washington area.

  But the task of trekking among meeting venues at the 
meeting was not serene. The TRB meeting took place in three 
hotels -- the Sheraton, the Omni Shoreham and the Washington 
Hilton -- that were to be connected by a shuttle service. 
The shuttle did not run on Monday; signs posted that evening 
said the service would "resume" on the second day. The buses 
began operating Tuesday morning, but as a fresh snowfall 
made the streets even more slippery, the shuttle service was 
abandoned by midday. That left transportation choices of 
taxis, which had doubled their rates and could get stuck; 
the Metro, which was "experiencing delays"; or bundling up 
and going by foot -- usually a wet foot.

  Amidst the adversity, perhaps not surprisingly, spirits 
seemed high among the attendees. Robert Jaffe, who works for 
the Loral Federal Systems team on the national ITS 
architecture, began one session by recounting how a group of 
people waiting for an elevator in a Metro station where the 
escalator was broken learned that most of them were headed 
for the TRB meeting. The group "decided it was an object 
lesson in transportation," he said. But, he added, "I'm not 
exactly sure what the object was."

  Despite the small audiences at many presentations, it was 
possible to see the future flowing into the hall at a 
session called "Information Superhighway: Transportation 
Applications of the World Wide Web and the Emerging National 
Information Infrastructure." Over 140 people squeezed into a 
small conference room, extending through the doorway and 
lining up two deep in the hall to hear this presentation. 
One of the things they learned is that a home page 
dispensing information on travel in Seattle is receiving 
11,000 hits a day. If the home page had been for Washington, 
D.C., the message last week would have been, "Stay home."

NEW OPEN PROTOCOL
DEMONSTRATED FOR
ITS COMMUNICATIONS

  A new protocol in the public domain that allows data 
communications among different types of traffic management 
devices from different manufacturers made its public debut 
at the annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board 
(TRB) last week. Called the National Transportation 
Communications ITS Protocol (NTCIP), it is "the backbone of 
ITS" and will enable its widespread deployment, says Alberto 
Santiago, chief of the Traffic Systems Branch at the Federal 
Highway Administration (FHWA). 

  One of the first states to lay the groundwork for that 
deployment will be California. The state has passed a law 
that makes conformance with the NTCIP mandatory for any 
traffic control systems sold there after the first of this 
year.

  People involved in the effort to develop the NTCIP are not 
cautious in assessing its value. It is "probably one of the 
most significant events in 20 years in transportation 
history," says Kenneth Vaughn, task manager for the NTCIP 
effort at PB Farradyne of Rockville, Md., which served as 
systems integrator in the final push to create the standard. 
The FHWA and the National Electrical Manufacturers 
Association (NEMA) have been working cooperatively on an 
open standard for several years. Last year, in an effort to 
accelerate the process, an NTCIP steering group was formed, 
composed of government agencies, systems integrators and 
consultants.

  The work began originally as an effort to develop an open 
standard for communication between different traffic signal 
controllers and traffic management centers (TMCs). But a 
broader vision of possibilities developed. The NTCIP now 
will work "like an Internet to communication devices in the 
field," says Don McWilliams, senior systems analyst at PB 
Farradyne. Besides traffic signal controllers, potential 
devices that the NTCIP will support include variable message 
signs (VMS), controls for video surveillance systems, ramp 
meters, highway advisory radio (HAR) systems, automatic 
vehicle identification (AVI) readers, environmental or 
weather sensors and other vehicle detection systems. Traffic 
management centers can also use it to communicate with one 
another. The work is resulting in "a suite of protocols 
rather than just one protocol," says Vaughn.

  The NTCIP protocol is based on International Standards 
Organization/Open Systems Interconnect (ISO/OSI) procedures. 
It uses existing standards and technology, works with high-
speed and low-speed communications links and supports legacy 
systems.

  The NTCIP will be one of many protocols to come under the 
umbrella of the national ITS system architecture. In one 
session on ITS at the TRB, agencies were urged to include 
the NTCIP in their specifications when they purchase 
equipment. The advice came from Robert Jaffe of the Loral 
Federal Systems team that is working on the national 
architecture. The keys to successful implementation of the 
ITS architecture are "open systems, open systems, open 
systems," he said.

  A new catch phrase that appeared on the lips of many ITS 
officials at this year's TRB is "buy smart." Proponents of 
the NTCIP say that to purchase systems that use the new 
protocol is to buy smart, because it they will prove cost 
effective in the long run.

  The NTCIP steering group is actively soliciting 
suggestions on how to spread the NTCIP gospel to local 
engineers and decision-makers. At the TRB they passed out 
"Surf'n NTCIP" buttons that displayed the address of the 
NTCIP World Wide Web home page: http://www.atms.volpe. 
dot.gov/ntcip/. They also distributed questionnaires asking 
if people had heard of the NTCIP and if they would 
participate in further work on it, plus a "reality check" 
question: "Would you use the protocol as it currently stands 
in a new system? If not, specify why not." Further 
information on the protocol can be obtained by faxing a 
request to Santiago at 703-285-2264.

  As pressure to deploy ITS systems has built up, so has the 
work on the NCTIP. Participants referred to the "lightning 
speed" at which it was finally put together. A year ago 
there was not even a good draft specification, says 
Santiago. PB Farradyne did not charge any fee for work 
specifically on the NTCIP, says Vaughn. The firm is working 
with the FHWA, under a contract worth about $5 million, on 
the development of real time traffic adaptive control 
systems (RT-TRACS). The NTCIP is integral to this work. If 
an additional contract for the NTCIP had been necessary, 
this could have delayed the standard for about a year and a 
half.

  A demonstration of the new protocol at the TRB went from 
idea to reality in four months, Vaughn says. For the 
demonstration, eight different signal controllers and three 
VMS from different manufacturers were linked to one computer 
over one telephone line. Another computer was linked to the 
first computer to show the ability of TMCs to talk to one 
another. Small colored lights representing traffic signals 
on a miniature roadway cycled through green, yellow and red 
either simultaneously or sequentially, depending on how they 
were programmed.

  The first three standards of the NTCIP are currently under 
legal review at NEMA. The FHWA expects to stage field 
demonstrations this summer at various locations. What is 
called the Caltrans version of the NTCIP -- which is already 
mandated -- is now, and will continue to be, in conformity 
with the NTCIP, says McWilliams.

  The NTCIP steering group consists of: the FHWA; the I-95 
Corridor Coalition; the California Department of 
Transportation (Caltrans); the states of Florida and 
Washington; the City of Los Angeles; the Texas 
Transportation Institute; Rockwell/Allen-Bradley Co.; 
Barton-Aschman Associates; DKS Associates; Intersection 
Development Corp.; Loral Federal Systems; and PB Farradyne. 
Other participants include ANSTEC, ARINC, Oak Ridge National 
Laboratories, and Opus One.

  Organizations planning to deploy the NTCIP include the 
public agencies on the steering group and Irvine, Calif.; La 
Mesa, Calif.; Las Vegas Area Computer Traffic System; 
Richardson, Texas; Santa Clara, Calif.; and Dade County, 
Fla., according to a Department of Transportation handout.

RAYTHEON PROMOTES
STAMP-SIZED RF TAG
FOR ITS APPLICATIONS

  Raytheon Co. in Tewksbury, Mass. is touting a new 35 GHz 
radio frequency (RF) tag the size of a postage stamp that 
can be read by a standard police radar gun. The tag can be 
used in applications involving electronic toll collection 
(ETC), smart parking, smart license plates, automobile 
identification and vehicle registration, the company says.

  In mass production, its cost would be competitive with 
other RF tags, says William McDonald, manager of ITS 
Programs at Raytheon. It's "fair to say that the retail cost 
of the tag would be less than $20," he says. The 35 GHz tag 
comes in two versions. A passive, read-only tag without a 
battery is the one that is the size of a postage stamp. An 
active tag with a battery is a little smaller than a half 
dollar. The communications range of the active tag is more 
than 1,000 feet, depending on where it is placed and on the 
weather, McDonald says.

  A police radar gun would have to be modified to include a 
small flat panel display to convey the information it 
receives from the tag. But since that part of the technology 
is available more or less off the shelf, it would help keep 
the cost of systems integration and deployment low, McDonald 
says. The technology for the system was developed by 
Raytheon's E-Systems Group under government contract. E-
Systems was acquired by Raytheon in the spring of last year.

  "It will be interesting to see if they can penetrate the 
electronic toll market," says Don Davis, associate program 
leader for transportation at the Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory, who has done extensive work on automatic vehicle 
identification (AVI) standards at the state and local 
levels. No standard currently exists for ETC, but many of 
the big players, both users and manufacturers, have made 
some choices, he says. In North America, nearly all 
electronic toll collection (ETC) systems use technology 
licensed at 915 MHz; in Europe most systems operate at 5.8 
GHz.

  "At this point in time I think it may be more confusing 
than anything to add yet another option to the menu," says 
Davis. McDonald says he hopes future architectural standards 
will permit a higher frequency range than what is envisioned 
at this point. The situation is fluid and options are 
flexible, he says.

  Unlike transmissions at lower frequencies, transmissions 
at 35 GHz are highly directional and make it possible to 
reduce cross-talk interference between lanes, says McDonald. 
The high frequency also provides a much higher rate of data 
exchange than tags currently used, he says.

  At the top of the microwave or Ka band, where the 35 GHz 
band is located, there are few existing applications, 
reducing the chance of interference, McDonald says. The 902-
928 MHz band, where North American AVI systems generally 
reside, is also used by other services, creating the 
potential for in-band interference. McDonald says he is not 
sure if commercial applications in the 35 GHz range require 
licensing but Raytheon "frequency people" are looking into 
that now.

  The tag could prove appealing to auto manufacturers 
because it is small enough to be placed almost anywhere on 
the vehicle for different uses, he says. "I believe that 
there are a number of car companies at this moment that are 
investigating the use of RF tags for industry use." Tags 
could assist car makers in the assembly process and could 
allow the electronic retrieval of data when a vehicle comes 
in for servicing, he says.

  Communications at higher frequencies could also find their 
way into automobiles through intelligent cruise control 
(ICC) systems, says McDonald. Within a few years, devices 
operating above 60 GHz will be produced and placed in cars 
in production volumes, he says. Another large potential 
market for high frequency tags is in applications involving 
license plates and vehicle registrations. If the tag is 
encrypted with a vehicle identification number (VIN) and the 
owner's ID, police could get an automatic read on the 
vehicle under zero light conditions, he says.

  All of these non-ETC applications could possibly have an 
effect on ETC standards. If a major car manufacturer rolled 
out a significant number of cars with factory-installed 
tags, that could in effect set a standard for future "smart 
cars" and electronic toll payment technology.

  "The industry has seen a lot of wild claims in the past. I 
wonder how real their product is," says Davis. But Raytheon 
has a track record of delivering components of radar 
technology. It has been involved in transponder technology 
for over two decades, McDonald says. It currently makes both 
silicon chips, used in 915 MHz systems, and gallium arsenate 
(GaAs) chips, used in higher frequency systems. Applications 
for its GaAs chips include high frequency intelligent cruise 
control (ICC) for a number of automotive tier one 
manufacturers, he says.

  The Raytheon chip used in the 35 GHz tag has been 
patented. McDonald says he is not permitted to discuss the 
internal technology, which he says is "compatible with 
industry manufacturing techniques."

CONGESTION PRICING
MAKES ITS DEBUT
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

  Congestion pricing -- enabled by ITS -- gained a toehold 
last month in southern California with the opening of the 
privately-owned SR 91 Express Lanes. In fact, that section 
of California currently is the only part of North America 
where congestion pricing projects are emerging from the 
planning stage. Public outcry recently halted an ambitious 
collection of congestion pricing programs in the state of 
Washington (see Inside ITS, Aug. 14, 1995). But in addition 
to the new commercial roadway in Orange County, a variably-
priced "HOV buy-in" project in San Diego is moving toward 
initial implementation this spring.

  The SR 91 Express Lanes, developed by the California 
Private Transportation Company (CPTC) in the median strip of 
state-owned SR 91, opened for business Dec. 27. The ten mile 
road is the first in the world to collect tolls entirely 
through electronic means. MFS Network Technologies in Omaha, 
Neb. supplies the electronic toll collection (ETC) system, 
with automatic vehicle identification (AVI) technology 
supplied by Texas Instruments in Attleboro, Mass.

  Patrons pay a variable toll, ranging from 25 cents to 
$2.50, to travel the Express Lanes. The toll varies 
according to a fixed schedule, so that the highest fee 
applies during peak travel periods and the lowest during 
hours when traffic is lightest. Vehicles with three or more 
occupants may use the lanes free of charge at all hours, 
though they must have transponders to validate their status. 
Drivers who do not wish to pay, or who do not have 
transponders, remain on the parallel freeway.

  CPTC is not disclosing either the number of transponders 
it is distributing or the volume of traffic the Express 
Lanes have seen so far -- a privilege it is allowed because 
it is not a public entity. The firm is "very pleased" with 
the response it has received from the public so far, says 
Greg Hulsizer, general manager at CPTC in Anaheim Hills, 
Calif. "We're literally working 'round the clock to fulfill 
all the orders, all the applications for transponders," he 
says, adding that traffic volume on the road has been 
building since the day it opened.

  As CPTC officials expected, the road is used most heavily 
during peak travel hours -- the westbound lanes in the 
morning and the eastbound lanes in the evening, Hulsizer 
says. This is in spite of the fact that the toll is highest 
at those times.

  Patrons who establish toll accounts with credit cards pay 
no deposit for their transponders but must put at least $40 
into a pre-paid toll account. Patrons who use cash or check 
must pay a $30 deposit and start their toll accounts with at 
least $50.

  CPTC officials at one point in their planning had talked 
about using actual traffic levels, as determined by traffic 
surveillance systems, to determine tolls. Under this system, 
the cost of using the lanes at the same hour on Thursday and 
Friday, for example, could have been different if actual 
traffic volumes were different.

  "We do have the capability to do that," Hulsizer says. But 
market research showed that customers "prefer some 
stability," he says. "They would prefer to know what the 
toll is when they wake up in the morning, and when they 
leave work. And so at least for the time being, we've 
decided to try and stick to our schedule."

  A little to the south of Orange County, however, real time 
traffic conditions eventually will determine what drivers of 
single occupancy vehicles (SOVs) pay for the privilege of 
using a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane under San Diego's 
planned buy-in program. The price will begin at $2.60 and 
rise as demand increases. "It's going to be run by the 
computer, and it's going to go as high as it needs to go to 
maintain a level of service B," says John Duve, project 
manager, advanced transportation at the San Diego 
Association of Governments (SANDAG).

  A consortium led by SANDAG is conducting the three year 
buy-in project under the federal Congestion Pricing Pilot 
Program, run by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). 
The federal agency is contributing 80 percent of the cost of 
the $16.1 million project, which focuses on an 8.5 mile, two 
lane reversible HOV lane in northeastern San Diego (see 
Inside IVHS, April 10, 1995).

  Participants had hoped to start operating an interim 
version of the system in the fall, but the target is now 
this spring. Among other things, the need to comply with 
regulations springing from an "executive order on 
environmental justice" has delayed the six month planning 
process, Duve says.

  The interim system will operate for six months to a year 
while participants are installing an electronic toll 
collection system. Under the interim system, variable fees 
will not be in effect. Rather, motorists will pay $100 per 
month for a transponder that will allow them to use the HOV 
lane. California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers will use 
portable readers to interrogate the transponders for 
information indicating whether the motorist's account is up 
to date. Single occupancy vehicles with unpaid accounts, or 
without transponders, will be pulled over.

  Participants still have not chosen a vendor to supply the 
ETC system. The California Department of Transportation 
(Caltrans) is responsible for that part of the project, Duve 
says. It's still not clear if the state agency will treat 
the HOV project as an extension to its contract with MFS 
Network Technologies to supply ETC for toll bridges in the 
state, or if it will open a new procurement, he says. Any 
system chosen would have to conform to the Caltrans 
specifications for non-stop ETC.

  It's also not clear yet how many transponders the project 
will require at the outset, but the number is likely to be 
small -- probably 3,000-5,000, Duve says. This is based on 
an estimate of 1,000 cars per hour paying to use the lanes 
during a three hour period when the HOV lane is open. Unlike 
most toll authorities, which distribute transponders through 
special customer service facilities, officials with the San 
Diego project plan to distribute tags through electronics 
retailers such as Radio Shack and Circuit City, he says.

VOICE-BASED SYSTEM
FOR ROUTE GUIDANCE
REACHES THE MARKET

  Two years after it announced it had developed a voice-
based route guidance system, Amerigon in Monrovia, Calif. 
has started shipping production units. Four manufacturers of 
audio compact disc players -- Alpine, Clarion, Eclipse and 
Kenwood -- are selling the "Interactive Voice System" (IVS) 
under their own labels.

  The IVS provides route guidance without the use of a 
vehicle location system. Instead, the user tells the system 
the location of the trip's starting point as well as the 
destination. Once the system generates a route, it provides 
a list of driving instructions, offering them one at a time, 
as prompted by the user. In addition to giving directions to 
addresses the user specifies, it can locate and direct him 
to restaurants, hotels, cash machines, tourist attractions 
and other points of interest stored in its database.

  The system does not include a screen or a set of buttons. 
Instead, it uses a voice recognition system to accept 
commands from the user, and voice output to provide 
directions, prompts and other messages. Amerigon claims the 
system can understand the full range of North American 
dialects and accents.

  Map databases and other software are stored on CDs. To 
operate, the IVS must be connected to a compatible car 
stereo CD system.

  Amerigon's product has undergone several changes since the 
company displayed a prototype at the Consumer Electronics 
Show (CES) in Las Vegas two years ago (see Inside IVHS, Jan. 
31, 1994). The company has abandoned its earlier name for 
the system, AudioNav, in favor of IVS. Each of the CD player 
manufacturers has given the product its own name, but the 
term IVS also appears on their packaging and in the 
software. The term is used to describe the product category; 
"it's sort of like VHS or GPS," says Paula Finnegan, 
Amerigon's sales and marketing manager for navigation 
systems.

  More significantly, the production unit relies on a 
different navigation database than the prototype. Amerigon 
has displayed versions of the system using data from Etak in 
Menlo Park, Calif., and the prototype system has been 
displayed in Etak's booth at trade shows such as the 
exposition at ITS America's annual meeting.

  The unit Amerigon currently is shipping, however, uses 
data from Navigation Technologies (NavTech) in Sunnyvale, 
Calif. Finnegan declines to explain the reason for the 
change. "We have license agreements with both and are still 
working with both," she says. The company could employ data 
from either firm, or both, in the future, she adds.

  Etak's understanding is that "Amerigon has always intended 
to use NavTech for their introductory product, and us for 
later products," says Pamela Crowley, an Etak spokesperson. 
Crowley speculates that when Amerigon decided on this 
course, probably two years ago, "at that point probably 
NavTech had better turn-by-turn data than we did." She would 
not draw direct comparisons between the quality of the turn-
by-turn navigation data available today from the two 
competing firms.

  Other changes include improvements to the speech 
recognition system, provided by Lernout and Hauspie Speech 
Products of Belgium, and the addition of non-volatile random 
access memory (RAM). The latter allows the system to store 
the vehicle's location (as indicated by the driver) when the 
car is shut off. Upon returning to the car, if the user 
immediately wants directions, the system will already know 
its starting point.

  The non-volatile RAM also allows the system to store up to 
ten frequently-used landmarks -- "like a speed dial 
feature," Finnegan says. The stored locations can be used as 
either starting points or destinations. To indicate a stored 
location the user says, for example, "number one," rather 
than following the usual procedure, which is to spell out 
the location letter by letter.

  The four manufacturers are selling the IVS for prices in 
the $600-$700 range. But unless the user already has a 
compatible CD player installed, the real cost of using IVS 
also includes the price tag for the audio system. Kenwood is 
selling the IVS and a CD player in a package as well as 
selling them separately; the other three treat the IVS only 
as a separate product, Finnegan says. Pricing varies among 
the manufacturers and depends on the features of the CD 
system, but the total cost of an IVS and a compatible CD 
player begins at about $1,000, she says.

  The IVS as sold by Kenwood and Eclipse can be linked to 
in-dash CD players manufactured by those companies, 
including systems the user may already have installed. The 
units sold by Alpine and Clarion connect to CD changers that 
are installed as add-ons to a car's existing stereo system. 
Customers buying the system from those companies must buy 
both the IVS and the changer, Finnegan says. Clarion 
customers also have the option of buying a "CD changer 
controller" to link the IVS to a previously-installed CD 
changer and in-dash stereo, she says.

  Whatever price the user pays for the hardware, it does not 
include access to the map databases. The IVS comes with a 
package of CDs containing data for all the metropolitan 
areas currently available. The customer, however, must call 
a toll free number to obtain an 11 digit pass code which 
activates the software. Amerigon charges $80 to activate one 
metropolitan area. Customers who activate more than one 
metro at once receive a ten percent discount on the second 
and subsequent databases.

  Amerigon chose to give away the discs but charge for 
activation, rather than simply sell the discs, largely for 
three reasons, Finnegan says. The first is that this saves 
the company money by allowing it to pack data for several 
metro areas on one disc. The metro database Amerigon uses 
requires less disc space than the corresponding database 
used in a screen-based navigation system because Amerigon 
doesn't need the code necessary to draw maps on screen.

  The second reason has to do with security, Finnegan says. 
The pass code a user obtains is keyed to a particular 
hardware unit. The customer cannot use the disc in a system 
installed in another car. The third reason is that this 
distribution method doesn't require retailers to stock discs 
for all available metro areas as a separate product line, 
she says.

  Databases currently available are: New York/New Jersey; 
Washington D.C./Baltimore; Los Angeles/Orange counties; Los 
Angeles five county extended coverage; San Francisco; San 
Diego; Las Vegas; Chicago; Detroit; and Indianapolis. 
Amerigon says ten additional databases will be available 
this spring. Material NavTech distributed at the ITS World 
Congress in Yokohama, Japan this fall indicates the company 
also has finished mapping Seattle/Tacoma; Sacramento; Santa 
Barbara, Calif.; San Bernadino and Riverside counties, 
Calif.; Phoenix; Denver/Boulder; Houston; Dallas/Fort Worth; 
Atlanta; Miami; Grand Rapids, Mich; and Philadelphia. It 
expects to complete Albuquerque, Austin/San Antonio, 
Minneapolis/St. Paul and Tampa/St. Petersburg this year.

  As new databases become available, Amerigon will market 
them directly to existing customers, Finnegan says. The 
company also will offer annual updates to the databases; 
pricing for those has not been determined, she says.

  Although the system's main function is to help drivers 
navigate, Amerigon had its eye on something more when it 
changed the product's name from AudioNav. "We're calling it 
IVS, Interactive Voice System, and getting away from just 
pure navigation, because there is the possibility of 
additional software titles in the future," Finnegan says. 
These might include guided tours, educational materials and 
children's games, all conducted through voice interaction. 
At the Winter CES in Las Vegas earlier this month, Amerigon 
demonstrated a voice-based game of blackjack "as a proof of 
concept," she says.

FUNDING EMERGENCIES,
NEED FOR INNOVATION
CHALLENGED ITS IN '95

  Last year was marked by both ITS funding crises and 
innovative attempts to fund ITS projects. Even as the 
Clinton Administration called for big cuts in spending on 
highways and other transportation infrastructure, the 
President began 1995 by asking the new Congress for close to 
$356 million for ITS programs in fiscal year 1996 -- $66.5 
million more than he requested the previous year.

  Of the new request, $100 million was for a new initiative 
called Trailblazer, which would fund model deployments of 
integrated suites of ITS technology for traffic management 
and travel information. Trailblazer was to be the first 
major foray beyond ITS research, testing and planning into 
the realm of real deployment. Besides this request for a new 
program, the budget was also complicated by the fact that 
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed a 
reorganization that would consolidate 10 agencies into three 
and restructure its funding mechanisms.

  With budget hearings still in progress, ITS proponents 
were alarmed to learn that the House version of last 
spring's balanced budget resolution called for eliminating 
the federal ITS program entirely. The Senate version of the 
resolution did not mention ITS, but the program took a hit 
over the summer when Clinton signed into law a compromise 
version of a rescission bill that took back, among other 
things, $40.03 million in FY95 funds that the ITS program 
had not yet spent.

  In the transportation appropriation for FY96, the ITS 
program came out with $222.78 million, showing that Congress 
wished to see the program survive, even though it declined 
to expand its funding. Trailblazer received no funding, but 
Congress set aside $10 million to fund operational tests 
whose focus would coincide with the objectives of that 
initiative.

   The tough fight for funding in 1995 could be just a 
prelude to more of the same in 1996. "At this juncture, the 
jury is still out on the question of whether the program is 
a sound investment of federal dollars. Some projects appear 
to be yielding useful results; others are floundering," says 
a report on the federal ITS program released by the U.S. 
Congressional Budget Office at the end of the year.

  As a high-ticket effort that involves years of development 
and a new mode of transportation, the automated highway 
system (AHS) program made an easy target for critics who 
spoke of ITS as "science fiction." The program did obtain 
funding, although at a reduced level, which will extend the 
number of years the effort requires. In November, a year 
after it was selected to lead this effort, the National 
Automated Highway System Consortium (NAHSC) achieved its 
first milestone when it delivered a systems objectives and 
characteristics document. Another long-term effort of the 
DOT, to define a national ITS architecture, moved into its 
second phase when teams led by Rockwell International and 
Loral Federal Systems were chosen from a field of four 
competitors to work cooperatively with the DOT.

  The DOT selected only four ITS operational tests for 
funding in 1995, down from 17 the previous year. The smaller 
scope reflected both the tighter funding situation and the 
DOT's assertion that it is time to move beyond testing and 
focus on deployment. Anticipating higher volumes of 
international traffic due to the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA), two of the tests picked in 1995 will 
examine automated border crossing systems for commercial 
vehicle operations (CVO) in California and Arizona.

  A much anticipated CVO test focused on Interstate 75 in 
the U.S. and Highway 401 in Canada officially began its two-
year test period late in the year. Advantage I-75 is testing 
the use of weigh-in-motion (WIM) and vehicle-to-roadside 
communications (VRC) technologies to allow pre-cleared 
commercial vehicles to bypass weigh stations.

  Another operational test was scaled back dramatically in 
1995. The Chicagoland Advanced Driver and Vehicle Advisory 
Navigation Concept (Advance) project, once touted as the 
world's largest ITS operational test, slashed the size of 
its route guidance test from 3,000 to 75 units. Among the 
reasons given by officials was the need to show results and 
the slow development of markets for route guidance systems.

  Cost was a factor in the decision by Greyhound Bus lines 
to remove the radar-based collision warning system it 
purchased from Vorad Safety Systems in 1992. The reported 
success of the system -- that accident rates decreased over 
20 percent in the year after the system was installed -- had 
become a staple of speeches in support of ITS. But Greyhound 
officials said the benefits gained from the technology 
didn't outweigh the cost of keeping them running. Eaton 
Vorad, the Cleveland-based company formed when Vorad joined 
forces with Eaton Corp. in 1993, scored a success last year, 
nevertheless. Freightliner in Portland, Ore. began offering 
the firm's collision warning system as an option on a new 
model truck it introduced this year. Freightliner became the 
first truck manufacturer to offer such a system on a new 
vehicle.

  The past year also saw several efforts to develop 
innovative funding arrangements for transportation projects 
in the U.S. The privately-financed SR 91 Express Lanes 
opened in southern California in December (see story on page 
8). In the Puget Sound region of Washington, the idea of 
congestion pricing has not taken on as well. Public outcry 
put a stop to a cluster of transportation improvements that 
were to be financed through congestion pricing mechanisms, 
using electronic toll collection (ETC) technology to collect 
revenues.

  On the East Coast, the Dulles Greenway, the first 
privately-owned toll road in the U.S. this century, was 
completed in September, six months ahead of schedule. So 
far, however, traffic on the road, which uses an ETC system, 
has been reported far below expectations. The adjoining 
Dulles Toll Road, operated by the Virginia Department of 
Transportation (VDOT), continued its rocky path toward the 
development of its own ETC system, an effort it has had in 
progress since 1990. Last year's events included the 
purchase and delivery of ETC hardware from Combitech Traffic 
Systems in Sweden, which VDOT ultimately decided not to use, 
and the firing of its prime contractor, Cubic Toll Systems. 
Late in the year, Syntonic Technology was appointed the new 
prime contractor.

  Helping to clarify some issues related to standards, the 
Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) issued a long-
awaited ruling on location and monitoring services in the 
902-928 MHz band. This put an end to speculation that the 
FCC planned to move vehicle-to-roadside communications (VRC) 
systems off the band entirely and assign them to higher 
frequencies. The ruling provided relief to many owners and 
vendors of ETC systems in the U.S., which all currently use 
that bandwidth, although it came as bad news to Combitech, 
which opened a U.S. office this year to help promote its own 
ETC systems, which operate at 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz.

  Elsewhere in the ETC arena, the president and CEO of 
AT/Comm in Marblehead, Mass. apologized in a letter to the 
chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MassPike) 
for an "overheated" and "offensive" campaign to win an ETC 
contract. The letter blamed the offenses on John Hassett, 
who had recently resigned as president of AT/Comm. MassPike 
awarded the contract to MFS Network Technologies in Omaha, 
Neb. Specifications for the system were based on a 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by several 
Massachusetts agencies to provide for interoperable 
electronic toll and traffic management (ETTM) standards 
within the state.

  No fewer than 15 manufacturers displayed navigation 
systems at the Tokyo Motor Show, and more rental cars in 
America added them as options in more markets. But sales of 
the first factory-installed units of Oldsmobile's Guidestar 
reportedly have been slow. The market for navigation systems 
in the U.S. was complicated by a patent dispute involving 
the two major suppliers of map data and navigation software 
for that market -- Etak in Menlo Park, Calif. and Navigation 
Technologies in Sunnyvale, Calif. -- and Zexel USA, a 
NavTech ally whose technology underlies several of the 
onboard route guidance systems currently for sale.

  While funding for ITS was in question through much of the 
year, laborers in the ITS field found the money to attend 
meetings in ever larger numbers. More than 4,500 attended 
ITS America's annual meeting in Washington, D.C. in March, 
and the 156 exhibitors there represented a 60 percent 
increase over the year before. The second ITS World Congress 
in Yokohama, Japan drew 3,400 participants with 
approximately 300 attendees coming from North America and 
just over 300 from Europe. The annual meeting of the 
International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association 
(IBTTA), combined with the third International Electronic 
Toll and Traffic Management (ETTM) Symposium, drew a record 
crowd of more than 1,100 to New York. The combined Vehicle 
Navigation and Information Systems (VNIS) '95 and Pacific 
Rim TransTech conferences, held in Seattle in July, drew 
about 900 registrants.

VOLVO'S WITHDRAWAL PRECIPITATES
DEMISE OF TELEGUIDE NETWORK

  The plan to shut down Sweden's Teleguide service eliminates
a medium for transmitting routing information to motorists.
The videotext network was scheduled to offer a range of
information services, including a point-to-point route
planning system configured by Volvo AB (see sister
publication, Inside IVHS, Sept. 28, 1992).

  Stockholm-based Teleguide, a consortium consisting of
Swedish Telecom, IBM Sweden and Esselte, disclosed earlier
this month that all services would be terminated April 1. The
fledgling service began operations only last March.

           Routing Never Gets Off the Ground

  Volvo's routing service never made it out of the starting
gate. While tests of the service were run on the videotext
network for two or three months, the routing feature was
never formally introduced as a Teleguide service. Volvo had
been planning to offer the routing service over Teleguide as
part of a customer service package that included maintenance
and car parts information.

  While Volvo officials involved in the project expressed
disappointment that Teleguide services would be terminated
this spring, the Swedish automaker may have contributed to
the demise of the information service by delaying or
effectively cancelling its introduction of services over the
videotext network. Volvo decided in December not to offer its
planned Teleguide services.

  "Volvo's decision was important for all the Teleguide
products. When Volvo got out, this was the 'last piece of the
coffin,'" says Thomas Rickne, marketing director of
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and transport planning
at Cyberlogik AB in Gothenburg, Sweden. Cyberlogik was the
supplier of map data and technical support for Volvo's route
planning service. Cyberlogik, in turn, used a routing
algorithm supplied by Distribution Planning Software (DPS) in
Halesowen, West Midlands in the United Kingdom. DPS
manufactures the LogiX product line of routing, scheduling
and fleet management software.

  Volvo's main contribution to the routing service had
focused on the development of the user interface for the
Teleguide terminals. Unlike routing software packages
designed to run on PCs, the Teleguide system was not designed
to display maps of the recommended routes. Rather, it
displayed the point-to-point driving directions as text on
dedicated terminals. Volvo's routing service would have
provided route recommendations for trips on the major highway
and motorway networks. Map data used in the system did not
include street level information, which would obviously
prevent the system from calculating routes to specific sites
within cities.

                     Coming Up Short

  In explaining Volvo's decision to pull out of the Teleguide
project, Jan Hellaker, manager of automotive telematics at
the automaker's facilities in Gothenburg, notes that the
22,000 users currently on the network fall short of the
80,000 that had been expected to have terminals in their
homes and offices by now.

  What really doomed the service, however, was not the lower
than expected number of users, but a lack of willing
investors, says Olle Elioth, managing director at Teleguide.
"We tried to find other investors. We were not successful in
that," says Elioth.

  Teleguide officials announced the plan to cease operations
after Swedish Telecom and Esselte, an office equipment and
software company, decided to withdraw from the project.
Esselte, which has struggled for the past few years, decided
that Teleguide didn't fit into the recently restructured
company, says Elioth.

  Swedish Telecom's decision to pull out of Teleguide
reflects its move out of videotext services altogether.
"They're tired of videotext," says Elioth, adding that
Swedish Telecom plans to shut down its business-to-business
videotext service on Jan. 1, 1994. It has about the same
number of users as Teleguide. "There will be no public
videotext service in Sweden from 1994 onwards," he says.

  Elioth expresses disappointment about the decision to close
the Teleguide information service: "We'll not see anything of
this kind in Sweden this side of the year 2000," he says.

  The three primary investors collectively lost 325 million
Swedish kronor ($43.5 million) on the Teleguide project,
according to Elioth.

  For Volvo, its troubles with Teleguide stemmed from higher
than expected development costs. Sources say Volvo had
trouble developing applications for the videotext
environment. "They were forced to do a lot of basic
programming," says Cyberlogik's Rickne, who adds that the
lack of good software support significantly inflated
development costs. RDS-TMC Tests Set For Dynaguide In
Southern Norway

  While U.S. transportation policy officials continue to
debate the data transmission capabilities of RDS-TMC, their
counterparts in Europe are conducting additional tests of the
system's ability to broadcast traffic information. In the
latest move, transportation officials in Norway are planning
the country's first RDS-TMC (radio data system-traffic
message channel) tests. The Public Roads Administration is
laying the groundwork for a TMC test in Norway's southeastern
corner, not far from Oslo.

  Initial plans call for using the Dynaguide TMC units
developed by Sweden's Volvo AB. Dynaguide, unlike most other
TMC designs, displays traffic information graphically, rather
than displaying TMC text messages.

  "The plan is to test 10 of the Dynaguide units this summer
to see if RDS receivers can work with Dynaguide," says Finn
Berg, project manager for the traffic information project for
the Public Roads Administration in Tonsberg, Norway.

      Volvo Wraps Up First Round of Dynaguide Tests

  Volvo is concluding an initial round of tests in
Gothenburg, Sweden of the first 100 or so Dynaguides built.
Jan Hellaker, manager of automotive telematics at the Swedish
automaker, says Volvo engineers are compiling information
about a six week evaluation of the Dynaguide units. The tests
-- which involved 70 drivers -- got underway in the first
week of December. Hellaker says response to units has been
"very good."

  Dynaguide hardware and software were developed for Volvo by
MMI Systems AS in Sandefjord, Norway. Erik Hovland, an MMI
official, says a handful of the units originally built for
Volvo's tests in Gothenburg could be used for the planned
project in Norway. "We've not decided how many units would be
used," he says. Cost estimates for the project are also not
available.

  The scope of the project should become clearer as Hovland
completes a study about RDS-TMC for the Norwegian
authorities. He says it should be finished by the first of
March. The official name of the project is "traffic
information and control -- year 2000."

  While Berg acknowledges that the government will most
likely foot the bill for the project, he declines to divulge
how much money has been budgeted for the initiative. Berg and
Hovland recently met with the Road Directorate in Oslo to
inform the national office about the project. Presumably,
funding approvals were sought as well.

          Lillehammer Olympics Could Benefit

  Assuming the project in Tonsberg -- a popular weekend
destination for Oslo residents in the summer -- is
successful, the RDS-TMC network could be expanded north to
Lillehammer in time for the winter Olympics next February. "I
think the Roads Administration is very interested to see the
expansion of this project up to the Lillehammer area," says
Hovland, who cautions that such planning is "very
preliminary."

  For the Tonsberg area tests, the planning for which is more
advanced, Hovland says the ALERT-C message protocol used in
the Dynaguide tests in Gothenburg would also be used in
Norway. Modifications recently made to ALERT-C by the
European Broadcasting Union would not be incorporated into
the planned Norway tests, Hovland says. Traffic messages,
however, would have to be translated from Swedish into
Norwegian.

  Dynaguide is an in-vehicle information system that converts
TMC text messages into visual symbols displayed on a
digitized roadway map. The unit consists of a 5" color LCD
that interfaces to a conventional RDS radio.

  Early planning for the Norway project has focused on the
Dynaguide unit. But the Public Roads Administration is also
considering other text-based TMC devices. "We're looking at
both text and graphical displays," says Berg.

  As the manufacturer of Dynaguide, MMI's Hovland is
obviously keen to feature Dynaguide in the test. "As far as I
know, no text-based TMC receivers are under consideration,"
says Hovland, who first approached Berg about establishing
the Oslo area RDS-TMC project.

  While Volvo is not directly involved in the project, a
delegation of Norwegian project officials is scheduled to
visit the automaker's R&D facilities in Gothenburg in mid
March. The trip is designed to familiarize the Norwegian
officials with operation of the TMC network.

  In addition to using similarly configured in-vehicle units,
the Norwegian project will use the same TMC transmission
gear, which is supplied by Sweden-based Teli. "We have to use
equipment we know for the Norway project," says Hovland.
Negotiations are currently underway with NRK, the Norwegian
broadcasting company, and a local radio station, about
transmitting the TMC messages over their subcarriers, says
Berg.

             PC Version Also Available

  Along with the portable units, project officials in Norway
are interested in testing stationary TMC units that feature
the same graphical interface as the Dynaguide design. Hovland
says the PC version of Dynaguide could be installed in hotel
lobbies, gas stations and ferry terminals. "It's already
developed," he says.

JAPAN POLICE AGENCY ADVANCES
IVHS EFFORTS OUTSIDE OF VICS

by Robert L. French
  While Japan's VICS program may be stuck in the mud, two
IVHS initiatives associated with the country's police agency
appear to be making headway independent of the cooperative
program. The Japan Traffic Management Technology Association
(JTMTA), an industry organization that operates under
National Police Agency (NPA) auspices, has helped develop a
real-time traffic information service and a new infrared (IR)
vehicle detector.

  Rather than challenging the legitimacy of VICS (vehicle
information communication system), the JTMTA claims the two
initiatives could spur VICS officials to get their project
going. But industry observers note that the new traffic info
system, called ATISS for advanced traffic information supply
service, essentially serves some of the same functions as
VICS aims to.

  VICS has been moving at a slower pace than RACS and AMTICS,
the competing predecessor projects that were more or less
subsumed by VICS in 1991. The Ministry of Post &
Telecommunications -- which is the equivalent of the Federal
Communications Commission in the U.S. -- practically forced
RACS and AMTICS participants to join the VICS project, say
sources.

  The RACS (Road Automobile Communication System) project of
the Ministry of Construction (MC) and the AMTICS (Advanced
Mobile Traffic Information Communication System) project of
the NPA were vigorously pursuing independent traffic
information and communication infrastructures to service
essentially identical in-vehicle navigation and information
systems. RACS and AMTICS underwent several stages of
experimentation between 1986 and their consolidation in 1991.

  The most visible VICS activity in recent months has been
the preparation for a VICS demonstration experiment,
according to the recent issue of the VICS Newsletter. The
VICS demo is scheduled to be in operation in Tokyo later this
year.

           A New Traffic Information Service

  In the meantime, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department,
in conjunction with JTMTA, has spent two years developing
ATISS to make graphic traffic information available in real-
time to terminals -- i.e., computers, fax machines, TVs, --
in homes or offices via public switched telephone networks or
CATV networks. ATISS may also service in-vehicle units via
mobile telephone networks. Computers and in-vehicle terminals
may use the ATISS information in conjunction with digital
road maps stored on CD-ROM.

  Traffic information to be supplied by ATISS is essentially
the same as that originally planned for AMTICS, but with the
addition of current travel time for selected road links. An
ATISS operating company owned jointly by the Tokyo metropolitan
government and private industry will be started in June 1993 to
provide traffic information, for a fee, within the Tokyo
metropolitan area. The company will maintain an ATISS traffic
information database using data from the traffic control center
of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and will interface
with the communications media. Commercial operation of ATISS is
expected to commence after two years of experimental operation
involving up to 4,000 terminals Officials are planning a similar
venture for Osaka.

            NPA Develops Optical Beacon

  The second police project is the "optical beacon," a new
type of IR vehicle detector that also serves as a high-
bandwidth communication device for supplying traffic
information to, and for receiving link travel times from,
equipped vehicles. The optical beacon was developed by the
NPA in conjunction with the JTMTA.

  As a vehicle detector, the optical beacon reportedly
functions as well or better than the ultrasonic detector
widely used in Japan. In addition, the optical beacon has
two-way communication capability with a downlink data rate of
1,024 kilobits and an uplink rate of 64 kilobits per second.
Sources say the optical detector is considerably less
expensive than the ultrasonic device. The NPA plans to
install 5,000 optical beacons per year starting in April this
year. The devices will be integrated into the traffic control
centers already in place in 74 major cities throughout Japan.

  The NPA's objective is to upgrade the existing traffic
control system and move toward the next generation system
under the UTMS (universal traffic management system) concept;
the optical beacon would function as an enabling technology
of the new system.

             VICS to Evaluate Optical Beacon

  The VICS Promotional Council, which has responsibility
through its committees for conducting investigations and
research as well as for promoting the use of VICS technology,
has agreed to study the optical beacon as one of several
possible communications media. Other candidate communication
links explored by VICS and/or the predecessor RACS and AMTICS
projects include microwave beacons, tele-terminals (cellular-
like mobile data communication systems) and FM sidebands (see
IH, September 1992).

  An agreement last fall by the VICS Promotional Council that
its operational body would be organized after consulting with
relevant government authorities lends credence to the notion
that the program has been stalled. The supply of VICS
information would begin soon after the operational body is
established. The VICS operation will collect and consolidate
traffic data from the MC for intercity and urban toll roads
and from the police departments for urban streets. The
operation will interface via two or more communication links
with in-vehicle units.

  Other current VICS activities include those of the
international liaison office of the VICS Promotional Council
which, in addition to publishing the VICS Newsletter, serves
as the principal interface between Japanese IVHS activities
and those in Europe and North America. VICS, in essence, is
the closest Japanese counterpart of ERTICO in Europe and IVHS
America.

TIGER PROJECT SEEKS LICENSE,
FUNDING FROM U.K. GOVERMENT

  Over the next several months, the ill-fated Autoguide
project, now dubbed TIGER, may finally get underway. The
project's two stumbling blocks -- funding support and a
license from the Department of Transport to operate a dynamic
route guidance system in central London -- are being
addressed with renewed vigor by private and public
participants.

            Statement in House of Commons

  The importance the British government is putting on the new
project was highlighted in late December when Steven Norris,
the Transport Minister for London, took the unusual step of
issuing a statement in the House of Commons explaining the
background of the project. In the statement he confirmed the
view that the latest developments in cellular radio have
superseded the infrared (IR) technology and a new trial was
being prepared which the government would monitor closely.

  However, due to the adverse publicity stemming from the
continued delay in implementing the IR beacon-based
Autoguide, both the Department of Transport and GEC, TIGER's
main backers, are wary about publicizing the new project.

        License Could Be Granted Within 10 Weeks

  In any event, it looks as if the project is proceeding.
Eric Sampson, a senior official at the Department of
Transport, estimates that a license under the Road Traffic
Act could be granted to TIGER (Traffic Information and
Guidance on European Roads) officials within the next 10
weeks. Several versions of a licensing agreement have been
drafted. "Lawyers are crawling over it, as lawyers do," he
says.

  While Sampson acknowledges that the licensing process is
advancing slowly, he says GEC is largely responsible for the
pace of the negotiations and that the firm does not seem
unhappy with the current status of the effort. "GEC is not on
my doorstep screaming and shouting," he says.

  In addition to seeking the license, TIGER officials have
applied for government funding for the project from the
Department of Trade and Industry. GEC's Nigel Stansfield, the
project manager, says the total cost of the trial should be
10 million pounds sterling to 15 million pounds sterling.
Project costs would be shared among TIGER participants and
the British government. Funding from the Department of Trade
and Industry would be channeled through the PROMETHEUS
program, which Stansfield says could provide 25 to 40 percent
of the project costs.

  Along with GEC, TIGER participants include: Ford, British
Telecom, and the two main motoring organizations, the Royal
Automobile Club (RAC) and the Automobile Association (AA).

           200 to 500 Cars Could Be Equipped

  Stansfield says each of the main participants will have a
specific role within the project. GEC will manage the trial
as well as operating a dedicated traffic information center,
which is slated to be in North London. Ford would supply test
vehicles, probably up to 200 but maybe as high as 500. The
RAC is set to supply the traffic information, which would be
transmitted to the North London traffic center from the RAC's
own traffic control center in Croyden, south London. The AA
would supply the in-vehicle digitized road maps while British.
Telecom would supply the in-vehicle communications hardware.
as well as the cellular link. TIGER is planning to use Cellnet,
a private cellular company which is 60 percent owned by British
Telecom.

  For in-vehicle navigation systems, TIGER will most likely
use equipment from Philips, Motorola and Robert Bosch,
according to Stansfield. Following the trial, TIGER officials
may decide to market one of the three systems or another
design.

  TIGER is designed to guide motorists through the least
congested streets. Dynamic traffic information would be
transmitted to the specially equipped cars over the cellular
network. The vehicles themselves would act as probes of the
roadway network as vehicle positions and travel speeds would
be transmitted back to the traffic center. The field trial's
boundaries have not yet been established. But it's expected
that the route guidance system would cover the area within
the city's North and South Circular Roads.

              Local Concern About Rat-Runners

  While the Department of Transport may be in favor of the
TIGER project, some local authorities have another opinion.
John Davies, director of highways for the Royal Borough of
Kensington and Chelsea -- one of the busy inner London
boroughs -- and also transport advisor to the London Boroughs
Association -- which represents the views of many London
boroughs -- fears route guidance systems are likely to
encourage motorists to abandon the main roads and start using
otherwise quiet residential streets, much to the annoyance of
local residents.

  He believes the deployment of more traditional traffic
mitigation measures would be a more effective way of reducing
local congestion. Davies favors better parking control and
"urban clearways," rather than trying to displace vehicles
from busy streets altogether.

  If necessary, Davies says he will not hesitate to prevent
cars equipped with route guidance systems from using
residential streets in his borough. "We shall make some side
streets one-way only and put chicanes and speed humps on
others to make sure motorists won't use them."

  Like other London borough engineers, Davies says he already
gets many letters from local residents complaining about
excessive traffic on residential streets, and he fears that a
route guidance system would simply encourage more motorists
to become "rat-runners," (who try to dodge traffic on the
major roads by driving on smaller, residential routes).

  The Department of Transport's Sampson acknowledges that
local concerns about rat-runners have to be addressed. "The
boroughs are worried that route guidance systems will send
traffic from the larger roads onto smaller roads," he says.

  As part of its role in the project, the Department of
Transport has announced it will hold discussions with all the
relevant bodies that might be affected by the project. They
include representatives from London's 33 borough councils,
the Metropolitan Police and London's Traffic Director.

  Despite his concerns, Davies does believe a dynamic route
guidance system would be useful in helping motorists find the
best bridges to drive across the river Thames. At present, he
says many motorists make uninformed guesses about which
bridges are least congested.

  Stansfield predicts that the main trial should begin in the
summer of 1994 and will last for at least six months.
Assuming the project is a success, he estimates that a
commercial product could be available by 1996 or '97, perhaps
with a price tag as low as 500 pounds sterling with an annual
subscription fee of 100 to 200 pounds sterling.

U.S. DELEGATION SEEKS EURO
SUPPORT FOR NEW ISO PANEL

  A group of IVHS industry officials in the U.S. is spearheading
an intiative to establish international IVHS standards. The IVHS
division of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in
Warrendale, Pa. has succeeded in establishing an international
IVHS standards committee within the International Standards
Organization (ISO) in Geneva.

  Earlier this month, the new technical committee, TC 204,
held a "preparatory meeting" in Geneva in an attempt to
solicit support and cooperation from European IVHS/RTI
officials already involved in standards making activity.
Seventeen officials attended the meeting. The main
standardization organizations in Europe were represented at
the one-day event, including the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), European Electrotechnical
Standardization Organization (CENELEC), European
Standardization Organization (CEN), International Telegraph
and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) and the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

      SAE Serves as Secretariat of New Committee

  "We really have the support of all these national
organizations," says Arlan Stehney, an SAE official who is
serving as secretariat of the new ISO committee. SAE, as an
organization, will serve as secretariat of TC 204 on behalf
of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI),
according to Stehney.

  While the list of organizations and acronyms may be
confusing, the stated purpose of the new committee is not,
say its organizers. "What the ISO does is really pull them
all together," says Stehney. "Their standards efforts will
channel into the ISO committee." He stresses that the new ISO
committee will not replace other RTI/IVHS standardization
efforts currently underway.

        International Standards: A Tall Order

  Electronic toll collection and other related applications,
such as road pricing, is an area of immediate concern to RTI
officials in Europe and to their counterparts in the U.S. As
the number of electronic toll systems competing in the
marketplace continues to grow rapidly, the incompatibility of
those systems threatens to compromise the convenience gains
promised by the technology. The well-documented difficulty
that state and regional officials have encountered in trying
to establish standards for electronic tolling underscores the
complexity of the issues the ISO is trying to address on an
international scale. The establishment of regional, let alone
national, standards has proved to be a daunting task.

  The initiative is obviously an ambitious one and it remains
to be seen whether the existing standardizing bodies will
fully cooperate with ISO's new IVHS committee, which,
incidentally, has tentatively adopted the European acronym
RTI, for road transport informatics.

             Duplication of Work Avoided

  Considerable work on IVHS/RTI standards is already underway
in Europe, particularly within CEN and CENELEC. "We're trying
to avoid any kind of duplication of work," says Siemens'
director of exterior relations, Heinz Sodeikat, who attended
the ISO meeting on behalf of the IEC and CENELEC. Sodeikat
points out that CEN and CENELEC have previously reached
agreements about which RTI application areas the two groups
will develop standards for. CENELEC focuses on
"electrotechnical" issues while CEN covers non-
electrotechnical systems, he says.

  While Sodeikat expresses a willingness to cooperate with
the new ISO committee, he notes that there are already "too
many" committees working on RTI standardization issues.
"Unfortunately, it's inevitable," he says.

  Dik Van Wijk, a project manager from the Dutch Ministry of
Transport who serves as chairman of CEN's RTI committee, is
supportive of the new ISO committee. What's more, he says
support for it is growing in Europe. Initially, officials
from many European countries "did not show much enthusiasm"
for the ISO initiative, says Van Wijk. But since the ISO
technical board formally approved the RTI committee plan in
December, more countries have expressed a willingness to
cooperate with it.

  Six countries, including three in Europe, have already
established official links to the ISO committee. They are the
Netherlands, U.K., Czechoslovakia, Japan, China and the U.S.
Others are expected to join. "Germany has already indicated
that they're interested," says Stehney.

  Even with their most optimistic outlook, organizers of the
ISO committee don't expect to establish international
standards for all IVHS applications. "There may be areas
where international standards are not viable," acknowledges
Stehney, who cites radio frequency allocation as a likely
problem area. "You can't standardize frequencies," he says.

  Richard J. Weiland, vice chairman of SAE's IVHS division,
agrees. "The magic word in the international arena is
harmonization," he says. Weiland is the general manager of
SEI Technology Group as well as chairman of the standards and
protocols committee of IVHS America, the Washington, D.C.-
based advocacy group that serves as an advisory committee to
the U.S. Department of Transportation.

  Along with other members of the U.S. delegation, Weiland
was pleased with the outcome of the Geneva meeting. Two
informal resolutions were passed. One recognizes the
organizations currently involved with RTI standardization in
Europe and recommends that once an initial work program is
accepted, that an ISO/CEN coordination meeting be convened.
The other resolution stemmed from a separate meeting the same
day with an existing ISO committee -- TC 22 -- that is
already working on RTI standards. TC 22 is ISO's
road/vehicles committee. The new and existing ISO committees
have agreed that TC 22 will retain primary responsibility for
man-machine interface and other in-vehicle systems while the
new RTI committee -- TC 204 -- will be responsible for
overall systems and infrastructure issues.

       ISO Committee Proposes 11 Working Groups

  ISO's new RTI committee is proposing to establish 11
working groups. They are 1. architecture and open system
interfaces; 2. spatial databases; 3. traffic/transit/parking
information collection and distribution; 4. traffic
management systems and coordination; 5. public, emergency and
commercial fleet management; 6. short range communications;
7. wide area communications; 8. navigation, positioning and
route guidance; 9. safety critical software; 10. human
interfaces and ergonomics; and 11. vehicle/highway
automation.

  The structure of the new committee and its program of work
will be discussed further at the first formal meeting of TC
204, which will be in Washington, D.C. Stehney says the event
is scheduled to take place April 19-21 at the Georgetown
University Conference Center. The meeting is open to
interested parties. For more information, call Stehney at
+412-776-4841.

GENERAL LOGISTICS EXPANDS
TRAFFICMASTER IN U.S. AND U.K

  General Logistics' Trafficmaster network is expanding
within the United Kingdom and, most recently, abroad as well.
The Luton, U.K. firm has secured its first licensee in the
U.S.

  Westinghouse Electric Corp. in Baltimore, Md. has licensed
the technology for the traffic information service from
General Logistics. For an undisclosed sum, Westinghouse has
acquired the exclusive rights to market and operate
Trafficmaster in four regions of the U.S. The system, which
notifies motorists about traffic congestion on local
highways, is currently operating on the M25 motorway in
London.

            Westinghouse Becomes U.S. Licensee

  "It's the only commercialized system successfully operating
in the world. There's no reason we shouldn't have it here,"
says Dan B. Zeitlin, manager of IVHS systems at Westinghouse
and the person in charge of its Trafficmaster project.

  As part of the agreement, General Logistics will supply
Westinghouse with the in-vehicle hardware and roadside
equipment as well as training and engineering support.
Depending on which firm you ask, the agreement extends for 12
or 15 years. Both parties describe the pact as a "long term
agreement."

   Westinghouse is planning to launch two Trafficmaster pilot
projects this year and to introduce commercial service at
those same sites next year. Don't expect to see
advertisements for Trafficmaster, however. The system will be
marketed under a different name, which Westinghouse hasn't
yet selected. The firm is open to suggestions, according to
Zeitlin, who says Westinghouse's legal department and
marketing gurus are mulling over a list of proposed names.
"It's a huge list," he says.

  While the two firms signed the agreement in late December,
neither has formally announced it. What's more, neither party
will say what the contract is worth nor what regions of the
U.S. are covered in the agreement. "I'm not at liberty to
disclose the value of the deal. But we're very happy with
it," says David K. Martell, chairman and managing director at
General Logistics.

  Westinghouse plans to release more details about the
agreement after it has secured approval from a local
transportation authority to proceed with a pilot project.
"Clearly, we need the public authorities' approval," says
Zeitlin. "We're having discussions with transportation
officials."

           Trafficmaster on Capital Beltway?

  Sources close to the project say Westinghouse is initially
targeting the Capital Beltway in Washington, D.C. and the
Baltimore Beltway as sites for the first pilot projects.
While Zeitlin declines to confirm this, he doesn't deny it
either. "Certainly, Maryland is of great interest because
we're based here. And the D.C. area is a good market," says
Zeitlin in response to questions about the two sites.

  Martell says the agreement permits Westinghouse to operate
Trafficmaster services in four states. Zeitlin says the
licensing agreement covers four territories, and that more
than four states are included in those territories. In any
event, Zeitlin says Westinghouse wants to establish
Trafficmaster services on the east coast, west coast and in
the midwest.

  At present, Westinghouse is the only Trafficmaster licensee
in the U.S. General Logistics, however, is currently engaged
in negotiations with other firms interested in marketing
Trafficmaster elsewhere in the U.S. Martell doesn't expect
any other agreements will be signed in the next "couple
months." He says the Westinghouse deal is "by far the most
advanced" of the initiatives underway in North America.
General Logistics has already signed licensing agreements
with firms in Italy and Austria.

           U.K. Expansion Set for April 27

  Back in the U.K., General Logistics has set April 27 as the
launch date for the expanded Trafficmaster network, which
will extend to Birmingham, Bristol and the Channel ports. The
existing network includes 120 infrared (IR) traffic detector
sites; the expanded network will add 300 more sites. Martell
says detectors at 230 of the 300 new sites have already been
installed.

  To date, Martell says there are more than 3,000
Trafficmaster subscribers using the London area network. Over
the past six months, he says 200 new subscribers have been
recruited per month. "With the geographic expansion, that
figure should increase dramatically," he says.

  Unlike most other IVHS projects in the U.S., Westinghouse's
Trafficmaster plan doesn't call for federal funding.
Trafficmaster is a commercial service: in the U.K., the
portable unit is priced at 199 pounds sterling and the
monthly subscription charge is 20 pounds sterling.
Installation is 50 pounds sterling. A rental option permits
subscribers to pay 30 pounds sterling per month in user fees
in addition to the 50 pound sterling installation charge.

  While pricing has not been established for the U.S.
introduction of Trafficmaster, the basic system design will
not be modified by Westinghouse, at least not initially. The
portable receiver is designed to work in a vehicle. The
unit's backlit LCD displays areas of congestion on the
motorway network by means of flashing blocks, which show the
location, speed and direction of snarled traffic.

  The system relies on a dedicated network of IR traffic
detectors that log the speed of passing vehicles. If the IR
devices determine that traffic is traveling below a pre-set
threshold of 30 mph, a message is relayed via a data radio
link supplied by Paknet, Ltd. to the Trafficmaster control
center in Luton. Updated traffic information is then
transmitted every three minutes from the control center to
the in-car receivers. The information is broadcast to the
portable units over the Air Call Paging network. Westinghouse
is planning to use IR traffic detectors and a paging network
for its Trafficmaster system in the U.S. "We're in
negotiations with a paging company," says Zeitlin.
Westinghouse may not, however, use a data radio link to
transmit information from the remote traffic detectors to the
control center. Zeitlin says project officials are
considering other means of transmitting the raw traffic data,
such as land lines.

         Westinghouse Initiates Negotiations

  The Westinghouse/General Logistics deal stemmed from
negotiations initiated by Westinghouse. "They approached us
about a year ago," says General Logistics' Martell.
Westinghouse, which is making a considerable investment in
several IVHS applications areas, sees Trafficmaster as one of
its traveler information system offerings. "This is only part
of it," says Zeitlin. In the future, Westinghouse may
integrate the Trafficmaster data with other traffic
management systems, he says.

U.K. RTI GROUP LINES UP
STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS

  The newly formed RTI/IVHS information group in the United
Kingdom has established a steering committee that includes
several key players in the industry. RTI Focus (UK) Ltd., a
new group with non-profit status based at the government's
Transport Research Laboratory in Berkshire, has the support
of the Department of Transport and major electronics firms,
transport consultancies and academia.

      Department of Transport Supports New Group

  Susan Harvey, the company's founding chief executive, says
the steering committee consists of representatives from the
Department of Transport, the Department of Trade and
Industry, the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), Peek
Traffic, GEC Traffic Controls, Jaguar, Dowty Electronics, the
Royal Automobile Club (RAC), the Met Office, University of
London Transport Studies Unit, Croyden Borough Council
(London), Strathclyde Borough Council (Glasgow), London
Transport, the Metropolitan Police, Travers Morgan and
Halcrow Fox.

  Harvey says that the steering committee members have had to
pay a hefty 4,000 pound sterling annual subscription fee,
which will help defray the 150,000 pound sterling start-up
and operating costs. However, she says the annual fee for the
steering committee members is expected to decline to 3,000
pounds sterling in the second year and to 2,000 pounds
sterling in the third year.

  Harvey says the next step for RTI Focus is to recruit
additional members. She expects the group to be fully
operational by June and, in time, to include up to 200 firms.
The cost of becoming a member without representation on the
steering committee has been set at 500 pounds sterling.

  The group's primary role, according to Harvey, is to
promote the interests of its members as well as advancing RTI
developments. One of the main benefits of membership, she
says, will be access to the large RTI database which is to be
established at the TRL and will contain details of industry
firms in the U.K. as well as RTI developments abroad.

  In addition, she says the group will publish a quarterly
newsletter, arrange four meetings a year for the steering
committee and organize two seminars per year which all
members would be eligible to attend.

         Liaison Sought With Other Associations

  RTI Focus has received support from officials in Brussels
and from the Department of Transport in London about
presenting papers at upcoming seminars, Harvey says. In the
future, she hopes the group will have enough funding to be
able to commission its own RTI research. The group has also
established contacts with officials at the ERTICO and DRIVE
offices in Brussels and at the IVHS America office in
Washington, D.C.

  Prior to starting up the RTI association, Harvey was an
industrial advisor and transport specialist at the National
Economic Development Office (NEDO) in London. In addition to
Harvey's role at RTI Focus, she has recently established a
new transport consultancy in London, named Traffic Solutions
Ltd. Harvey, along with partner Peter O'Neil, who formerly
worked at the DRIVE office in Brussels, is planning to do RTI
consulting work.

                 How Big Is The Market?

  A recent NEDO report estimates the size of the UK RTI
industry at about 60 million pounds sterling. By the year
2010, NEDO estimates the RTI market will be worth 3 billion
pounds sterling. "The same phenomenal growth is also being
predicted worldwide," says Harvey. The biggest potential
growth areas in RTI are dynamic route guidance systems and
electronic tolls, she says.

  Eamonn McArdle, managing director of Peek Traffic, believes
the new group will play a significant role in promoting RTI.
"We hope the group will campaign on behalf of major RTI
issues as well as helping to push sales of new U.K. RTI
products for all the members."

NEWS IN BRIEF

  *It looks as if the new presidential administration in
Washington, D.C. will continue to support, and fund, IVHS. As
part of his recently unveiled economic plan, President Bill
Clinton is calling for $345 million in IVHS funding for
fiscal years 1994-1997. The plan also calls for $100 million
in IVHS funding for FY98, which is beyond Clinton's current
term.

  While these numbers appear to be reduced from the IVHS
funding levels outlined in the six-year Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) passed in 1991, the
budget numbers cited above reportedly are intended to be
additions to the ISTEA provisions, according to the Federal
Highway Administration, which sought an explanation of the
figures from the Office of Management and Budget. ISTEA
authorizes $113 million per year in IVHS funding. If Congress
approves Clinton's plan, federal funding for IVHS over the
next four years could top $200 million per year. By
comparison, the federal government -- under the Bush
Administration -- has budgeted $143 million in IVHS funding
for the current fiscal year.

  *Copies of the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT)
IVHS strategic plan are available from the FHWA's office of
traffic management and IVHS. The DOT submitted the five year
plan to Congress in December as required by ISTEA. Requests
for copies can be faxed to the FHWA at 202-366-2249 or mailed
to the agency at 400 7th Street S.W., Washington, D.C.,
20590.

  The 67 page document outlines the goals and milestones of
the DOT's IVHS program for the next five years. "What is
needed is a 'smarter' surface transportation system, one that
actually functions as an integrated intermodal system,
offering improved safety, more efficient use of
infrastructure, and enhanced user choices through the
application of IVHS technologies and services," writes the
DOT in the executive summary of its report.

  While the report acknowledges IVHS America's contribution
to DOT's plan, the federal agency's report does not derive
directly from the five year strategic plan developed by the
Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, says George Beronio, a
systems engineer at FHWA.

  DOT's plan establishes 18 milestones to be accomplished
during the next five years. "Beyond 1997, deployment of a
nationally compatible IVHS system will become the
Department's primary concern. Work will shift towards
supporting deployment of IVHS user services, and continuing
progress on long-term IVHS goals, especially the Automated
Highway System," writes the DOT.

  *Following expansion of its Trafficmaster network up to the
Birmingham area, General Logistics is hoping to establish its
traffic information system in Scotland. David K. Martell,
chairman and managing director at General Logistics in Luton
near London, says negotiations are underway with the Scottish
Office about installing Trafficmaster on the motorways in the
Glasgow and Edinburgh area. While compatible with the system
in England, Martell says the Scottish system would be
operated separately.

  *For electronic toll and traffic management (ETTM) system
vendors, the order of the day seems to be to sue one another.
In the latest move, AT/Comm in Marblehead, Mass. has filed
two patent infringement suits against its chief competitors,
Amtech and Mark IV/Vapor. In the suits, filed in U.S.
District Court in Boston, AT/Comm claims "that the newest
generation of electronic toll collection systems known as
read-write, in the forms produced by Amtech and Mark
IV/Vapor, are in direct conflict with claims under AT/Comm
patents," according to a statement issued by AT/Comm. The
Massachusetts ETTM vendor says the suits could directly
affect procurements in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and
Orlando.

Japan's tire demand to hit 2nd highest in '95+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's domestic demand for motor vehicle tires for this year
is expected to rise 8.5% from last year to 1,027,000 tons, the
second highest level on record following the 1.03 million tons
posted in 1990, an industry association said Monday.
     The Japan Automobile Tire Manufacturers Association said demand
for new tires will reach 210,000 tons, up 0.7%, while that for
replacement tires will increase 8.2% to 403,000 tons.
     Demand for tires for export will rise 13.3% to 414,000 tons,
the association said.
     Akira Suzuki, managing director of the association, said,
''Total tire output for this year is certain to hit a record high
given production plans of domestic tire makers for November and
December.''
     The steady growth stems largely from brisk exports to Southeast
Asia and Europe, and strong demand for replacement tires,
particularly those for trucks, association officials said.
     Domestic demand for tires next year will fall 1.7% from this
year to 1.01 million tons, the association said.

Japan's Nov. vehicle output falls 9.1%++

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's motor vehicle output in November fell 9.1% to 863,460
for the sixth straight month of declines from year-earlier levels,
an industry association reported Monday.
     The figure brought the number of vehicles produced in the 11
months to November to 9,423,306, down 2.8% from a year earlier, the
Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
     Domestic sales of motor vehicles in November rose 4.6% to
593,073, while exports are estimated to have fallen 21%, it said.
     Passenger car output in November came to 655,067 vehicles, down
5.7% from a year earlier for the sixth straight month of decrease.
     Output of trucks fell 18.9% to 204,047, also marking the
sixth consecutive decline.
     Production of buses, however, rose 8.1% to 4,346 for the first
rise in seven months, the association said.
     Of passenger car production, automobiles with engine capacity
of over 2 liters accounted for 218,532, down 7.8%, and smaller cars
fell by the same margin to 354,714, it said.
     In contrast, output of minicars with engine capacity of less
than 660 cc jumped 12.3% to 81,821, it said.
     Sales of passenger cars in the domestic market in November rose
7.0% to 380,405, with sales of trucks up 0.8% to 211,784.
     Motorcycle production in November fell 9.0% from the same month
last year to 210,451, after rising 1.5% in October.
     The association said cumulative production of motorcycles in the
first 11 months of this year grew 2.0% over the same period
last year to 2,540,235.
     The association said sales for the whole of 1995 are estimated
to reach 2.74 million units, up about 0.5% over the previous year
and the first rise in three years.
     It said brisk sales of bikes with 50 cc engines were a major
factor for the gain.
     The association said production of 50-cc bikes for the
January-November period soared 10.3% over a year earlier to 886,077
units.

Toyota Motor to promote younger managers on merit basis+

NAGOYA, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Japan's top automaker Toyota Motor Corp. will start promoting
younger workers to managerial posts, in a personnel shakeup from
Jan. 1, on the basis of merit rather than seniority, company
officials said Monday.
     The officials, however, said only a few younger personnel were
appointed as department chiefs or deputy department chiefs this time,
since it was the first round of promotion reform.
     The company also unveiled a sweeping reorganization program
involving both domestic and overseas operations.
     Emphasis will be put on consolidation and realignment of
administrative and production departments in North America, where
local vehicle production is expected to increase, the officials said.

Kantor welcomes progress in Japan's auto market opening+

WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Thursday he
welcomes progress in Japan's market-opening and expansion of
Japanese automobile transplants in the six months since an
automotive trade accord with Japan was concluded.
     ''I am pleased with the progress made to date, particularly in
the areas of deregulation of the Japanese after-market and the
increased investment in Japanese auto transplant operations,'' he
said in a statement.
     The accord reached in Geneva between Kantor and Japanese trade
minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in June averted the imposition of 5.6
billion dollars in sanctions on Japanese luxury car imports.
     ''The progress in these areas translates into real benefits for
American workers and American companies,'' the statement said.
     ''We will continue to vigorously monitor implementation of the
agreement to ensure strict compliance,'' Kantor said, noting that
U.S. exports of autos and auto parts for the third quarter of 1995
have increased by 31% over the same period of last year.

Toyota tops TSE list of aggregated stock value+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Toyota Motor Corp. topped the 1995 rankings for high stock
value released by the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Friday.
     The list showed the closing price of Toyota stock at the end of
1995 trading Friday standing at 2,190 yen per share for an aggregated
value of 8,191.7 billion yen.
     Japan's leading automaker was followed by three financial
institutions, the Industrial Bank of Japan, Mitsubishi Bank and
Sumitomo Bank for second, third and fourth places.
     Domestic telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. ranked eighth and Nomura Securities Co. placed 10th.
     The exchange also said an average 357.02 million shares were
traded daily in 1995, up 8.6% over the previous year's 328.47
million shares.
     The value of daily trading, however, was down 5.5% at 315.7
billion yen, it said.
     The exchange said the trading value fell below 300 billion yen
from March to June but then turned upward in July on active buying by
foreign investors.
     In December, it said, the value of daily trading hit the year's
high of 471 billion yen.

5-year airport buildup program to begin in FY '96+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government on Monday endorsed the Transport Ministry's
five-year airport consolidation program which will entail total
investment of 3.6 trillion yen, starting in fiscal 1996, ministry
officials said.
     They said the budgetary appropriations were incorporated in a
draft budget for fiscal 1996.
     A total of 141.4 billion yen will be disbursed as public works
expenditures related to airport consolidation in the initial year, up
7.3% over the current year, they said.
     In addition, they said 563 billion yen will be earmarked for the
program from a special account for the airport consolidation program,
up 2.7% over the current year.
     The initial-year outlays will include 76.3 billion yen for the
expansion of New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, east of
Tokyo.
     An appropriation of 191.6 billion yen will be earmarked for the
construction of new runways at Haneda International Airport in
Tokyo, the officials said.
     The new fiscal budget also will include 30.5 billion yen for the
consolidation of two existing superexpress railways in northern Japan
and construction of a new superexpress line in the southern main
island of Kyushu, they said.
     The government will provide 4.8 billion yen for the
technological development of a linear motor railway and 14.7 billion
yen for construction of local railways, the officials said.

Snow, strong winds grip Hokkaido, air traffic disrupted+

SAPPORO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Snow and strong winds hit the main northern island of Hokkaido
on Monday, wreaking havoc with transportation systems as flights
into and out of New Chitose Airport and train runs were canceled.
     Ninety-nine schools in Hokkaido were also forced to close as a
Siberian cold wave gripped northern Japan and buffeted much of the
Japanese archipelago.
     A typhoon-strength low-pressure system centered in the Pacific
Ocean off Hokkaido disrupted transportation systems, causing 47
flights into and out of New Chitose Airport to be canceled along with
train runs.
     Chitose airport, the gateway to Hokkaido, had been
intermittently closed since Sunday evening.
     An estimated 43,000 passengers on the Japan Railways and other
railway systems in northern Japan were also stranded by the weather
when 117 train runs, including eight JR express train runs, were
canceled, railway officials said.
     One person was missing after a fishing boat was overturned in a
weather-related accident in the mouth of a river near Oga, Akita
Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast, police said.
     According to the Sapporo meteorological observatory, the low
pressure system east of Hokkaido is expected to bring heavy snow to
the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk region through Tuesday.
     During 24 hours by 3 p.m. Monday, 32 centimeters of snow had
fallen in Kushiro, while 23 cm were recorded in Tomakomai.  The 10
cm falling in Sapporo added to the 74-cm accumulation there, 53
cm more than the average.
     In western Japan, accidents caused by the rough weather were
also reported.  In Kyoto Prefecture, a 57-year-old man died when his
tractor hit a support post in his storehouse, causing the
snow-covered tin roof to collapse on him, police said.
     In neighboring Shiga Prefecture, a 52-year-old woman was found
dead in a stream near her home.  She is believed to have slipped on
the snow-covered road and fallen into the stream, police said.
     Road, train and air traffic systems were also affected by the
weather.
     The Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for heavy snow,
strong winds and high waves across wide areas ranging from northern
to western Japan.
     In some mountainous areas, snow of up to 80 cm is expected to
fall by Tuesday morning.

Air India plane makes emergency landing at Karachi+

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     A Dubai-bound Air India jetliner with 179 people aboard made an
emergency landing at Karachi airport Thursday after a hoax telephone
call that a bomb had been planted on the plane, Pakistani Television
Corp. (PTV) reported.
     PTV said the flight had originated in New Delhi and was in
midair when it was diverted to Karachi, following a call received by
Indian aviation authorities that a bomb was aboard.
     No bomb was found but the plane could not leave due to several
technical problems, PTV said.
     The passengers were accommodated in Karachi and being sent to
Dubai on different flights, it said.

More ship export contracts being made in yen+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     More yen-denominated export contracts for Japanese ships are
being made reflecting views in the industry that the yen is unlikely
to rise in the near future, a spokesman at the Japan Ship Exporters
Association said Monday.
     ''A lot of people apparently expect the yen to stay around
current levels against the dollar for the time being,'' the spokesman
said.
     He said the ratio of yen-based export contracts to all
contracts on a ton basis dropped to 20.8% in April and 14.5% in May,
but has increased over the months, standing at 52.4% in October and
53.3% in November.
     ''The share is likely to stay above 50% in December,'' he said,
noting that shipping companies are now willing to pay in yen because
record low interest rates in Japan make it attractive to procure
funds in the Japanese currency.
     During the dollar's drop which continued until last summer,
shipowners had asked to pay export contracts for ships in dollars,
fearing that payment in yen would prove costly should the yen rise
further against the dollar.

Kobe Port wins British award for postquake recovery+

KOBE, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The specialist British trade magazine Containerization
International says in its December edition it has chosen the
quake-ravaged port of Kobe in western Japan for its ''Company of the
Year'' award for 1995, port officials said Thursday.
     The magazine, which is distributed in some 120 countries, chose
the port over more than a dozen other companies and organizations
around the world for the rapid manner in which it is recovering from
the destructive impact of the Jan. 17 Great Hanshin Earthquake.
     The quake rendered much of the port of Kobe inoperable, and left
some 6,300 dead in the city and its environs.
     An official at Kobe's Port authority said he considers the award
the result of a concerted effort by the city's administration and the
private sector.
     ''We'd like to see the prize as an incentive toward recovery,''
he said.

Seibu Railway suffers 5.1 bil. yen forex loss+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Seibu Railway Co. has suffered a 5.1 billion yen foreign
exchange loss through helping a U.S. subsidiary but the loss will
not affect its fiscal 1995 earnings, a company official said
Thursday.
     The loss emerged after the railway operator bought preferred
shares issued by its Hawaiian subsidiary as part of its capital
increase, using 84 million dollars Seibu lent to it producing a
foreign exchange loss of 2.85 billion yen, Masao Horiguchi, managing
director of Seibu, told a news conference.
     Horiguchi said the replacement of the loans with preferred
shares is to reduce the burden of interest payments by Aina Kamalii
Corp. and thus to improve its earnings standing.
     Aina Kamalii runs hotels and golf courses in Hawaii.
     Seibu Railway has no plans to revise its earnings projection for
the current fiscal year ending March 31, announced Nov. 24, because
the loss had already been factored in, he said.
     According to the projection, Seibu Railway's unconsolidated
pretax profit will reach 500 million yen on operating revenues of 229
billion yen.  Net profits are expected to hit 2.3 billion yen.
     By the end of next March, the company will replace another 76
million dollars worth of the loan with preferred shares to be issued
by Aina Kamalii, producing a foreign exchange loss of some 2.3
billion yen, but this loss, too, has been discounted, Horiguchi said.
     The rest of Seibu Railway's loans to Aina Kamalii, totaling 560
million dollars, will be replaced with preferred shares in the next
fiscal year, he said.
     This is likely to incur a foreign exchange loss of some 4
billion yen, which the company is considering offsetting by selling
land, he said.

ADTRANZ AND POLISH RAIL TO SIGN USD200 MILLION DEAL

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

ADTRANZ, the joint venture between ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swedish-Swiss
engineering group, and Germany's motor vehicle and transport giant DAIMLER
BENZ may sign a USD200 million deal for the delivery of modern electrical
locomotives with Polish State Railways (PKP) for the delivery of
electrical locomotives. In September, the Polish Privatisation Ministry
signed an initial agreement with Adtranz on selling 75% of rolling-stock
maker PAFAWAG on the condition that the Polish firm and PKP agree on a
locomotive delivery programme. Under the agreement, Adtranz would pay
USD3.7 million for a stake in ailing Pafawag, bringing modern technology
to Poland's only rolling-stock maker, and invest USD28.1 million over the
next six years. PKP plans to invest 8 billion Zlotys for modernising its
rolling-stock over the next five years.

BRITISH AIRWAYS AND BANQUE RIVAUD TO SAVE AIR LIBERTE

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

BRITISH AIRWAYS, in association with the French RIVAUD group, was
authorised on November 5 to salvage AIR LIBERTE, a French private airline
placed under a legal recovery procedure in September after chalking up
losses of nearly one billion Francs since 1993. Final approval for the
takeover is expected on December 15, following an observation period of 40
days. The two partners plan to inject 630 million Francs into the company,
including 150 to be committed by British Airways. With TAT and Air Liberte
under its belt, BA will control 20% of air traffic flying out of Orly
Airport, and will further increase its influence with the introduction of
new flights and more links to Nice-Toulouse and Bordeaux. BA hopes to have
Air Liberte solvent again within three years. The British plan has gone
down well with Air Liberte's employees, but not with the civilian aircraft
pilots' union, which fears job losses.

UNITED STATES APPROVES SAS/UNITED AIRLINES ALLIANCE

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

The United States Department of Transportation approved, on November 5, a
cooperation alliance between SAS, the Scandinavian airline, and UNITED
AIRLINES of the US. The Department also granted anti-trust immunity to the
three-way SAS-United-LUFTHANSA alliance as part of the open sky Agreement
signed by the US and Germany last Spring. SAS and United Airlines, which
signed a cooperation accord in September 1995, have been jointly offering
66 "code-sharing" transatlantic flights since April.

AIRBUS: HISTORIC DEAL WITH USAIR

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

The European consortium Airbus Industrie has made a significant
breakthrough into the world market by winning a contract with USAir, the
United States' fifth largest airline, for a confirmed order of 120
aircraft from the single-corridor family (A319/320/321), a to-be-confirmed
order for 120 others and an option on another 160 aircraft. This
agreement, for which a final contract must still be prepared, is worth
some USD18 billion and constitutes a victory over Boeing, Airbus's main
competitor.

For the past several months, Airbus has been running nearly neck and neck
with Boeing. Last Spring, the European consortium sold 30 A320s to China,
a market until recently dominated by Boeing and its B737. In July, Airbus
won a contract worth USD two billion to sell 45 aircraft to General
Electric's leasing company. Since their introduction in the early 1980s,
1,110 planes from the A319/320/321 family have been sold to 64 airlines
(450 of them to North American customers), of the 2,204 machines that
Airbus has sold worldwide. The diversification of a single type of
aircraft into several versions is a concept that appeals to airlines, as
it allows them to achieve operational economies. The same pilot is
qualified to fly all three aircraft, which have identical cockpits, and
maintenance, a source of considerable costs, is also similar. During the
first ten months of the year, Airbus captured 42% of the market with 125-
and 350-seat planes, the same range covered by the A319/320/321/330
twin-engine models and the four-engine A340.

AIRPORTS: PANOPLY OF INITIATIVES TO REDUCE NOISE

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

As the European Commission launches an offensive against noise within the
framework of its November 5 Green Paper on this issue (see separate
article in Section III), European airports are up in arms. After British
authorities enacted drastic regulations on London's airports, sparking
protests from airlines, the Italian Environment Ministry introduced a
series of measures aimed at quelling noise around the country's airports
on October 21.

The Italian measures would close airports between midnight and six in the
morning and apply only to civil aviation. The international airports of
Fiumicino in Rome and Malpensa in Milan would remain open, but only for
international flights. This proposed noise reduction Decree would also
change certain flight paths, institute a noise inspection for each
aircraft every two years and require airport management companies to
present a noise reduction plan to municipalities affected by their
activities. Companies that break the rules will be fined two million Lire
for violations during the day, five million for excessive night noise and
seven million for nocturnal landings at international airports. A second
Decree concerns urban development in the areas surrounding airports and
would prohibit the construction of housing where noise exceeds 65 decibels.

IATA protests against British measures.

The anti-noise regulations published by the British Government last Summer
sets maximum noise levels for aircraft taking off from Heathrow, Gatwick
and Stansted at three decibels below international standards, effective
January 1, 1997. More frequent inspections and heavy fines for violators
are also provided for. The International Air Transport Association (IATA)
is opposed to the regulations, "the main impact of which will be to
penalise all airlines, including those with the most modern aircraft".
Parallel to its General Assembly in Geneva, the Association decided to
initiate legal proceedings against the British Government's Decree. The
new standards, which would be the strictest in the world, according to the
IATA, would prevent companies from using their planes at full capacity and
penalise even those most concerned about the environment.

OPEN SKIES STILL OVER THE HORIZON

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

Meeting in Geneva on November 4 and 5, the member companies of the
International Air Transport Association (IATA) observed that their numbers
include both supporters and opponents of worldwide deregulation. The major
American, European and Asian companies take an ultra-liberal view, while
the smaller companies of the developing world, unsure as to whether they
can survive in an overly competitive environment and desirous of remaining
independent on issues of national sovereignty, have reservations or simply
reject the idea of global liberalisation. While not categorically opposed
to deregulation, some smaller airlines in the European Union wonder how
the process of deregulation, already largely under way within the
Community, can be enlarged to encompass non-European, i.e. American
carriers.

However, the prospect of an open sky between Europe and the United States,
which have similar attitudes to liberalisation, is still apparently some
time off, given the harsh competition on this market of 600 million
travellers, which accounted for more than half of worldwide passenger
traffic in 1995, according to the IATA. The Americans criticised the
subsidies that European carriers receive and the Community regulations
that protect them, while the European Commission's representative accused
American authorities of not considering the liberalisation of its market a
priority.

The 254 member countries of the IATA are expected to achieve record net
profits of USD5.5 billion in 1996, a return rate considered encouraging.
The main reasons are restructuring and reductions in operating costs,
although the rising price of fuel is still a concern. The next General
Assemblies of the IATA will be held in November 1997 in Amman, Jordan, and
in June 1998 in Montreal.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL: WILL THE EUROPEAN UNION JOIN A REVAMPED EUROCONTROL?

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

In the wake of its March White Paper on air traffic control, the European
Commission unveiled a draft brief for the negotiation of Community
membership in Eurocontrol, which is responsible for management of air
traffic in Europe, on November 13, "so that the European sky can be
managed as a common resource, unrestricted by national boundaries".
However, the Community cannot join Eurocontrol unless its current areas of
competence and powers are reformed and enhanced. The Commission is hoping
that the Council of Transport Ministers will reach a common position on
the proposed mandate at its December 12 and 13 meeting. The European Civil
Aviation Conference (ECAC) will issue an opinion on the revision of the
Eurocontrol Convention in February 1997, within the framework of its
INSTAR strategic study.

In a White Paper published on March 6, the Commission discussed the need
to improve European air traffic control and combat growing congestion,
which causes delays and creates additional costs for carriers. The third
option set out in the White Paper, and the Commission's favourite,
provides explicitly for the EU's accession as a full member to a
"reinvented Eurocontrol", to ensure Community competence over air traffic
management and avoid any clash of competence between the two organisations
by allowing the Member States to speak with a single voice. This approach
would separate regulatory tasks (which would be the province of the new
Eurocontrol) and operational activities (the responsibility of the Member
States).

In the draft mandate it tabled on November 13, the Commission defines the
steps it considers necessary to take to implement the recommendations of
the White Paper. But two main elements must still be clarified, i.e. what
additional responsibilities and powers will be conferred upon Eurocontrol
to make the organisation capable of fulfilling its new role, and under
what procedure will the Community become a member of the reformed
organisation? Thinking strategically, the Commission plans to submit its
proposals for the Council's opinion before the end of the year (with a
view to a common position at the Transport Council of December 12 and 13),
to pre-empt any attempt by the 33 member countries of the European Civil
Aviation Conference (ECAC) to reform Eurocontrol without taking account of
the Community position at their Ministerial meeting in February.

Eurocontrol Convention review.

The EU's Transport Ministers must take a position as to whether to grant
the Commission a brief to negotiate with the non-EU members of Eurocontrol
on a revision of the Eurocontrol Convention which would expand the
organisation's role and allow the European Union per se to join. The
mandate is also expected to give the EU the right to vote and thus to
oppose any decision it considers contrary to Community interests.

Two models for Eurocontrol reform.

Meanwhile, the ECAC is working to finalise INSTAR, a strategic study on
the reform of European air traffic control. Although the Commission would
prefer the particular approach mentioned above, the White Paper left the
way open to new discussions with all concerned organisations, including
ECAC. In the intervening months, the two models have converged
significantly, although certain important points, including some related
to the competence of the future Eurocontrol, must still be settled,
including:

* the principle of a separation between regulatory functions and provision
of services;

* proposals concerning management of airspace (the Commission sees the
future Eurocontrol as having responsibility for structuring the European
airspace, defining military zones and flight paths and improving control
in border areas);

* the definition of common objectives for safety services and access to
airspace (which would devolve upon the revamped Eurocontrol under option 3
of the White Paper);

* coordination of technological research and development activities (the
ECAC would like this to be the task of Eurocontrol, while the Commission
would prefer this coordination to take place within the EU's Framework
Programmes for research);

* the creation of financial mechanisms to support common policy on air
traffic control (the Commission considers it important to allow the new
Eurocontrol to fund common initiatives).

Eurocontrol presents annual report for 1995.

In 1995, Eurocontrol had two good reasons to be satisfied with its
performance: on the one hand because it practically completed the third
and final phase of its EATCHIP programme on the harmonisation and
integration of air traffic control, and on the other as the new Central
Flow Management Unit (CFMU) took up its mission to reduce the congestion
of European airspace (becoming fully operational in March 1996).
Eurocontrol currently has 22 member countries: the EU Member States minus
Finland and Spain (accession pending), plus Turkey, Malta, Cyprus,
Hungary, Switzerland, Norway, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Romania
(the accession of Croatia and the Slovak Republic is being formalised).
Eurocontrol also has an important role to play in the management of
European air traffic since, having been recognised as the responsible
authority by a European Parliament Resolution of November 1995, it is now
regarded by the European Commission as having an essential contribution to
make to reforming the management of Europe's skies.

BRITISH AIRWAYS/AMERICAN AIRLINES ALLIANCE ON HOLD

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

A proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines, aimed
at establishing the world's largest air transport entity, is conditional
upon a number of decisions. It must be approved by London, Washington and
the European Commission, and its fate is also hinges on the outcome of
open sky pact negotiations between the United States and the UK. The
United States' approval is contingent upon the conclusion of an open sky
Agreement. The approval of the British Government is considered the most
easily overcome regulatory obstacle for BA and American, which are hoping
to get the go-ahead by the end of November. Based on a report by the
Office of Fair Trading, one of the UK's competition authorities, the
Ministry of Trade and Industry could accept the project, subject its
approval to conditions or instigate another phase in the competition
inquiry, by submitting the proposal to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.

The resumption of negotiations between the UK and US in Washington on
November 7 and 8 is considered a good omen for the future of British
Airways. Discussions so far have always foundered (on August 27, the
American delegation suspended talks on the ground that British proposals
were inadequate) and experts doubt that the companies will be able to
implement their agreement before the planned date of their alliance in
April 1997. Talks between the two countries could resume at Ministerial
level in early December. The main point of discussion is access for
American carriers to London's airports, including Heathrow. The proposed
BA/AA alliance sparked a strong reaction from USAir, the fifth largest
American company, which criticised a code-sharing agreement with British
Airways in protest.

NEW COMMISSION LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES FOR 1997

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

On October 16, the Commission adopted its work programme for 1997 which it
unveiled to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on October 22. Of the 16
legislative initiatives planned for next year, five directly concern
transport policy. These proposals cover:

* training of safety advisors for road, rail or inland waterway transport
of hazardous goods;

* the composition of boat crews, rest and navigation time;

* the measurement and control of noise in airport zones;

* the granting of certificates to air carriers;

* harmonisation measures necessary for the deployment of telematics in the
area of road transport.

The European Parliament gave the work programme a frosty welcome on
October 22, criticising the Commission for its lack of initiative in
proposing new legislation to an increasingly hostile Council of Ministers.

EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT FAVOURS BUDGET INCREASE FOR TRANSPORT

from TRANSPORT EUROPE, 15 November 1996, No. 67

The European Parliament proposed, on October 24, an increase of some ECU
800 million to the EU's draft Budget for 1997, over the amount agreed on
by the Council of Ministers in July. The additional funds would be used
for trans-European transport networks and the budget line on transport
policy, in which the Council planned to make severe cuts.

As is its right within the limits of the financial perspective, the
Parliament restored credits that the Council had dropped in July. In the
area of internal policy, the Parliament decided to create a reserve of ECU
300 million, including putting ECU 73 million in a negative reserve to
finance the 14 priority trans-European transport projects. This accounting
trick would allow it to dip into funds from heading 3 during execution of
the Budget. The Parliament also allocated more money to budget lines the
Council had cut, such as the environment, consumer protection, equal
opportunities for men and women, information and communication, the fight
against fraud and transport. Payment appropriations for transport now
total ECU 28.495 million (compared to 27.7 in the Council's proposal), but
remain well below those in the 1996 Budget (30.582 million).

INDONESIAN SKIES OPEN

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

JAKARTA - Indonesia has extended a full open skies policy to
Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries in a move
to encourage development in two east Indonesian provinces
Kalimantan and Sulawesi, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines.

Minister of transportation, Mr Haryanto Dhanutirto, told parliament
the facility will cover only point-to-point services and not
stopovers to overseas destinations. Airlines from Brunei, Malaysia
and the Philippines, partners of the East Asia Growth Areas (EAGA),
can now link the major cities in Kalimantan and North Sulawesi.

TOURISM CO-OPERATIVE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Gina Putong

HONG KONG - Tourism authorities in Hong Kong are strengthening co-
operative marketing promotions with the territory's counterparts in
China.

Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) chairman Mr Lo Yuk Sui said
Pearl River Delta Tourism Marketing Organisation initiatives are
being expanded.

Mr Lo reminded HKTA's annual general meeting of the tourism
industry's role as the second largest foreign exchange earner for
the territory's economy.

He said: "(Hong Kong) is assured of a positive future as China's
most open window on the world. We are now planning to expand our
Pearl River Delta Tourism Marketing Organisation initiative and
will also be co-operating as fully as possible with next year's
'Visit China Year 1997'."

He said joint efforts would be undertaken with the China National
Tourism Administration (CNTA) for exhibition booths, travel trade
shows and promotions of cruise hubs.

Ms Amy Chan, HKTA executive director, expressed confidence that
with verbal reassurances from Chinese officials that visa and
travel policies "should more or less remain the same", the industry
would continue to flourish after the handover next year.

ASIA HAILS NEW LEISURE ALLIANCE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Jeff Zuckerberg

HONG KONG - Executives of Thomas Cook in Asia have welcomed their
company's plans to form what they claim is the world's largest
leisure travel alliance with the giant American Automobile
Association (AAA).

Ms Keller Mak, general manager of Thomas Cook Hong Kong, said:
"This alliance will be a big incentive for people in Hong Kong or
elsewhere in Asia to travel with Thomas Cook when travelling to the
US. And this is a large sector of our business.

"We are leisure travel specialists, with over 30 per cent of our
business being travel to the US."

The alliance - which becomes fully operational on January 1 next
year - provides all leisure travellers who make international
arrangements through AAA access to the Thomas Cook "Worldwide
Customer Promise".

The Worldwide Customer Promise includes the following no-fee
services for holidaymakers: airline reservation changes, ticket
revalidation or rerouting, hotel and car rental reservations,
changes to travel arrangements and travel planning; and emergency
local telephone calls.

AAA will provide reciprocal services to Thomas Cook customers in
the US.

In addition to enhanced customer service, the AAA-Thomas Cook
alliance will focus on new technology applications and electronic
distribution.

The first joint project begins in January when AAA joins the
Catalist Trading Exchange.

Catalist is an electronic leisure travel booking system developed
by Thomas Cook, which integrates into AAA's new AVATAR system.

The system allows travel counsellors to create electronically-
customised vacations for independent or group travel.

"AAA's alliance with Thomas Cook allows the association to deliver
unparalleled customer service far beyond its borders," said Mr
Graeme Clarke, senior vice- president, AAA products and services.

"Today's announcement provides AAA members the same level of
security and peace of mind whether they are visiting Boston,
Britain or Beijing."

Future initiatives for the partners will include negotiations with
multinational suppliers and co-operative ventures in foreign
exchange and publishing.

IHA'S SPEARMAN RETIRES TO SPAIN

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE International Hotel Association (IHA) will bid farewell to Mr
Robin Spearman on September 21 when he retires to the Costa Del Sol
in Spain.

Mr Spearman has headed the Hong Kong office of the IHA since it
opened in May 1995.

Mr Andrew Jones, vice-president of human resources at the Marco
Polo Hotel, will take over Mr Spearman's position commencing
October 1.

After 21 years with Hilton International, Mr Spearman came to Hong
Kong in 1989 to head human resources at Holiday Inn Asia Pacific.

It was a very demanding position because with seven hotels in
China, Holiday Inn was hit hard in the aftermath of the Tiananmen
Square incident.

Mr Spearman was responsible for overseeing the evacuation of its
expatriate personnel from China and then subsequently rebuilding
that infrastructure.

While in Hong Kong, he was also chairman of the human resources
committee of the IHA, chairman of the advisory board for Hong Kong
Technical College and a member of the advisory boards for the hotel
programme at the Hong Kong Polytechnic and for PATA.

"I am very sad to be leaving Hong Kong," he said. "There's a family
feeling here in the hotel industry. But I'll be back next year -
either for the Cricket Sixes or for the handover."

Mr Spearman plans to take it easy for the next few months before
possibly teaching at a new hotel school in Spain.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT GROWING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

LICENCE has been awarded to Cantho Tourism and France's Electricite
et Eau de Madagasca for a US$4.2 million joint venture hotel
project in the Mekong Delta town of Cantho.

This will be the second hotel project for the French company, which
recently secured the first licence issued since early 1994 for a
100 per cent foreign-invested hotel project in Sapa.

Also considering investment outside Vietnam's mainstream
destinations is the Malaysian company of Goh Hock Guan, which has
signed an agreement for a US$12 million hotel development in Hoa
Binh.

Goh Hock Guan has, in the past, expressed interest in projects in
both Ha Long Bay and Hue, neither of which has seen any progress,
but Hoa Binh authorities express confidence in the company's
commitment to the Hoa Binh project. The second stage involves
constructing a golf course.

Saigontourist, meanwhile, is seeking foreign investment for a
health and spa resort in the province of Binh Chau.

LAOS CONTINUES TO DEVELOP

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

HOTELS are springing up all over Vietnam. Hanoi has 26 hotels under
development, while Ho Chi Minh City has 23. Danang and China Beach
are also sites for new hotel projects.

One of these new hotels has already started accepting bookings for
16 of its eventual 40 rooms.

It is the first foreign joint venture property to be built in the
former French retreat area of Tam Dao, 80km outside Hanoi. Other
hotels that have soft opened are the five-star Hanoi Daewoo and Na
Trang Lodge, the first international standard hotel in Na Trang.

Vietnam already has 26,000 international standard hotel rooms.

About 11,000 of these rooms were supplied by 160 joint ventures.
One of the first joint ventures is the three-star Century Riverside
Hotel Hue, managed by Century International Hotels since 1992.

  Meanwhile, the go-ahead has been given for a US$209 million joint
venture development project on a site overlooking the former US
embassy in central Ho Chi Minh City.

  The Asian Plaza Complex is expected to be completed by the turn
of the century.

CAMBODIANS HOLD TREK TOURS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

OPERATORS hoping to open new destinations in Cambodia's north-
eastern corridor, marketing the allure of untouched hill tribes,
will have to wait say members of Cambodia's travel trade.

Trekking tours to Modulkiri and Ratanakiri might inspire a
pioneering spirit in the hardest of backpackers, but mainstream
travel companies are cautious about the area's immediate potential.

This is in spite of an aggressive stance from Cambodia's Ministry
of Tourism which would like to promote new destinations. Both
provinces were spared during years of conflict, are reportedly free
of mines and offer cross border opportunities for selling packages
into northern Vietnam.

"We've seen the success of eco-tourism in neighbouring countries
and now we want to promote the natural, cultural and environmental
advantages in these areas," said under-secretary of state for
tourism, Mr Sok Chenda Sopea.

Local tour operators remain indifferent about sending clients to
destinations off Cambodia's beaten track.

"It is often mentioned but it is not ready for groups,' said Ms
Nongnuj Dobbs, Phnom Penh office manager for East-West Cambodia.

Lack of infrastructure, and only four weekly flights by Royal Air
Cambodge limit short-term development potential.

VIETNAM: AIRPORT INVESTMENT GROWING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

A RENOVATED domestic arrivals hall has opened at Hanoi's Noi Bai
International Airport and work is underway on a new US$60 million
terminal building, scheduled for completion by end 1997.

Doubts have been raised over expected Japanese involvement in the
project, and a Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV)
official said the government will finance the initial stages.

An agreement has been signed with the German firm, Thyssen, for the
supply and installation of terminal equipment. Under the deal, a
loan of about US$17 million will be provided.

Meanwhile, in Ho Chi Minh City, five foreign firms are competing
for investment in a new terminal building for Tan Son Nhat
International Airport. The building will allow Vietnam's main
gateway to be upgraded to an eight million-pax capacity.

Sources have suggested that departure taxes are likely to be raised
at both airports to cover costs.

And Royal Brunei Airlines has begun its twice-weekly Boeing 747
service between Myanmar and London.

The flights leave Brunei on Mondays and Thursdays and stop over in
Yangon and Abu Dhabi before proceeding to London's Heathrow
airport.

COMFORTABLE CHAOS IN HANOI

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AN oasis of green-shuttered calm, a city of enchanting lakes and
crumbling French architecture, the refined older sister to an
explosive young Ho Chi Minh City - these are some of the images of
Hanoi trotted out by Vietnam guidebooks.

You should not believe it. From the vantage point of a cyclo
(rickshaw) tour through Hanoi's ancient quarters, it was clear to
me that Vietnam's capital is anything but peaceful. Life is lived
out at full throttle as motorcycles seem to hoot their way not just
around you, but over and under you, in their impatience to get on
with life.

I had insisted we travel only by the ubiquitous cyclo - still a
leading form of transport outside Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. But I
hadn't bargained for the aftermath of typhoons Frankie and Nicki,
which left me knee-deep in water before I had even reached the
rendezvous.

When I finally arrived, my guide, Mr Hieu, was all smiles - and so
was I when I found he had lined up a car as well as a couple of
cyclos for us.

First stop for visitors to Hanoi is usually the Ho Chi Minh
Mausoleum, a fascinating if somewhat eerie monument housing the
embalmed body of the former leader affectionately known as Uncle
Ho.

It was Thursday and the mausoleum was closed. We headed instead to
the modernist, Russian-built Ho Chi Minh Museum for a quick tour of
the former leader's life. The exhibits are interesting but the
English language is scarce so a guide is much needed.

Next stop was the One Pillar Pagoda where we interrupted
preparations for a ceremony honouring a leading monk who had
recently died. Later we saw the charming Tran Quoc Pagoda
overlooking West Lake and the White Horse Pagoda where a white-
bearded monk talked about travel writer Barbara Cohen.

Hanoi's French quarter - walled colonial villas in wide tree-lined
boulevards - was seen from the comfort of the car en route to the
Temple of Literature, an 11th century centre of learning where Mr
Hieu pointed out the faint etchings on stone tablets that list each
year's three most outstanding scholars.

We were plunged from this scene of erudition into living Hanoi a
few minutes later, as we eased ourselves in cyclos and bumped and
swerved our way around the Water Tower, past half-hidden pagodas
and through the 36 narrow streets that make up the old quarter -
Silk Street, Herb Street, Steel Street and Flower Street.

Silk Street is the heart of Hanoi's tourist district and, according
to Mr Hieu, the owners of the yellow and green shophouses are
prosperous enough to own a second family home in other areas of
Hanoi where space and water are in better supply.

Beyond Silk Street, however, and we were passing family rattan
factories and wizened old women with blackened teeth selling
obscure cigarettes for a few cents each.

Proprietors here have not fared as well. Life is traditional,
fascinating and raw. This part of Hanoi will not live out economic
reforms.

This tour was arranged by Vietnamtourism Ho Chi Minh City, tel:
(844) 826-4154. Similar tours are available on request from most
tourism companies. Scheduled tours can be picked up at the city's
backpacker cafes.

A DESTINATION WITH AUTHENTICITY

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AGAINST a spectacular backdrop of silver-scarred mountains and
descending fog, a group of foreign tourists sit in a wooden hut.
They are offered bitter tea by a barefoot hostess clad in
embroidered scarlet, huge silver earrings hanging from her ear
lobes.

She belongs to one of the 60-odd ethnic minority groups based in
Vietnam's central highlands and mountainous north. Closely linked
to the Thai hilltribes, some of these groups have lived in Vietnam
for hundreds of years, others for thousands.

Virtually all retain a traditional lifestyle yet to be eased by
such conveniences as electricity and potable tap water.

The foreign tourists, meanwhile, form part of a growing group of
not-so-young visitors to Vietnam, willing to trek considerable
distances from base camps at places such as Sapa, Hoa Binh or Mai
Chau and to temporarily forego modern comforts for the chance to
get firsthand experience of the ethnic minority lifestyle before
the area becomes over-trekked.

Saigontourist, Ben Thanh Tourist, Vietnamtourism Ho Chi Minh City
and other leading tour operators offer trips around central or
northern Vietnam which include between two and five days of walking
and one or two overnight stays in ethnic villages.

While such tours are not a priority on the Vietnam National
Administration of Tourism's (VNAT) agenda, they nonetheless fit in
nicely with the image the NTO is trying to promote - as a rich
cultural destination.

"Cultural tourism" is the buzzword in industry circles and although
definitions are understandably soft, it is perceived as
educational, relatively environmentally friendly, and non-intrusive
for the host country.

More importantly, it addresses growing concerns shared by other
emerging destinations about the possible loss of Vietnam's cultural
identity in the face of increasing numbers of foreign visitors
touring more diverse destinations.

Explained Mr Do Quang Trung, chairman of the VNAT: "We are trying
to preserve our cultural and ecological environment and at the same
time promote tourism, which is a difficult task.

"I think we need to focus more on introducing our culture to
foreign visitors for this."

The idea of cultural tourism is not new and Vietnamese tour
operators are fired up by the idea of boosting cultural interest.

Said Mr Nguyen Van Nhi, general director of Vietnamtourism Ho Chi
Minh City: "We need to learn from other countries on how to
preserve the unique features of our country.

"We also need to create a more interesting product for tourists,
take them into the rural countryside, fruit gardens and pottery
villages.

"Or maybe take them into small family homes so they can see what a
family altar is like, rather than just be told.

"Basically we need to increase the cultural interest of tours in
Vietnam, not just in obvious ways.

"Culture influences so much, down to the way we arrange our
belongings in our houses. We need to create a specifically
Vietnamese product that is to do with history and culture.

"I believe that this is what people really want.

"Vietnamese, for example, are very interested in American culture,
and I am sure it works the other way too."

The new emphasis on culture - both popular and refined - is making
its way into tour programmes with Saigontourist now incorporating
farm visits in its Mekong Delta tours.

Conservationists in the former imperial capital of Hue are planning
authentic arts performances in the former Royal Theatre when
restoration work is finished next year.

It is also matched by a national enthusiasm for architectural
conservation that is applauded by most but has caused havoc for
developers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

Sadly, few believe such enthusiasm is enough.

AMAGINE a Hong Kong-based tour operator offering two- to three-
night cruises into southern China, passing through old villages,
visiting ethnic communities and historic sights, and seeing the new
houses of rich Chinese who have returned after making money in

After the cruise, passengers would have the option of a train
connection across the Thai border and down all the way into

Or, with the generating interest in eco-tourism, take a cruise to a
stalagmite colony in coral under the waters near Sai Kung and west
of Tun Mun.

These are potential new cruise opportunities which 26-year tourism
industry veteran, Mr Edmund Tsang, sees as future possibilities for
Hong Kong's cruise tour industry.

Mr Tsang, who joined Watertours of Hong Kong in January this year
as general manager, is deputy chairman of the Travel Industry
Council of Hong Kong. While he has an interest in promoting the
products of his own company, he has a broad perspective on the
cruise industry, having served on the boards of a string of travel
trade associations.

Watertours of Hong Kong, the largest of the local cruise tour
operators, handled about 130,000 passengers last year. Mr Tsang
predicts a modest 15 to 20 per cent increase in the business in the
next few years, but growth, he believes, will be contingent on the
government's willingness to improve and increase the number of
berthing facilities.

"Right now, part of the harbour is a bit discouraging because of
the choppy waters caused by high-speed water traffic," he said.

"There is no real concern by the government for those who love
boating.

"With many people trying to board private and corporate vessels at
the same time, the tour operators are loading at Queen's pier and
the Kowloon public pier.

"The situation is jammed."

The Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) among others, is
advocating that a new international passenger terminal be built,
perhaps at the present Kai Tak site.

Mr Tsang would like to see this also used as a boarding place for
local boating.

He has recommended to the government that other new boarding areas
for pleasure junks and tour operators be located in different parts
of Hong Kong, closer to where people live, such as at Tun Mun or
Kwun Tong.

His interest is not just in the overseas market, but also local
residents, partly because the expanding market of visitors from
China rely on Hong Kong relatives to guide and accompany them on
local sight-seeing tours.

Boarding points have to be conveniently located, and tours suitably
priced and promoted, for local people to think of taking their
China relatives on a trip.

Mr Tsang wants to see tours such as those to Lei Yue Mun and Lamma
Island marketed to Asian visitors not only as a seafood-eating
opportunity, but also as a chance to worship at the old temples in
the area.

On Lamma, he sees there are opportunities for Chinese and other
visitors to have a drink in the bars with the established
expatriate community, to talk to them and find out why they enjoy
the simpler style of life they have chosen in Hong Kong.

Mr Tsang notes that the water cruise business has adapted over the
years to accommodate the different interests of tourists as the
market changes and grows more sophisticated.

"In recent years, Asians have dominated the market. Many,
especially young Asians, are western-educated and are interested in
the cultural and historical side of Hong Kong.

"They are interested in seeing Po Lin Monastery on Lantau.

"The elderly don't tend to have this interest. They want to
concentrate on shopping.

"But younger Japanese, Malaysians and Singaporeans in particular
want to do what the European tourists do.

"They are likely to have afternoon tea at the Peninsula and travel
on the same boat as Europeans."

HONG KONG: THEME PARK IDEA TAKING OFF

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) has given a working title
to its plans to host a massive fair at the end of the century on
the runway at Kai Tak airport.

  Mr Mason Hung, the senior manager for product development at the
HKTA, said there would be so many millennium fairs around the world
that it had been provisionally decided to call Hong Kong's event an
exposition to set it apart from the rest.

  Plans for the Hong Kong Exposition are now being put to a
feasibility test, but could include a major business and trade
event.

  There could also be a permanent theme park on the huge site,
which will become available once the airport is relocated to Chek
Lap Kok in 1998.

HONG KONG: GOING TO WATER FOR HANDOVER

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AFTER 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong returns to China on June
30 next year. Inbound tourist operators are advising clients not to
visit during the week of the handover - unless they have a special
interest in politics and already have accommodation confirmed.

Plans for the official change of sovereignty ceremony on June 30
and the celebrations on July 1 are expected to be announced at the
end of September. But a mascot for the celebrations has already
been chosen. The Preparatory Committee - the body appointed by
China to prepare for the new Special Administrative Region - has
selected the dolphin as the celebration mascot.

The dolphin may seem a strange choice, considering Hong Kong is not
usually associated with these animals.

However, a rare white (or pink) dolphin (sousa chinensis) is native
to Hong Kong, it can still be seen in the waters north of Lantau
Island, in the same area where the new Chek Lap Kok airport is
being built.

If there is irony in choosing an endangered animal as the handover
mascot, the Preparatory Committee seems to have missed it.

Seeing Hong Kong's dolphins in the wild is the latest tourist
attraction being marketed to international visitors by the Hong
Kong Tourist Association (HKTA). Two cruises are available,
organised by Hong Kong Dolphinwatch, a small, independent eco-
tourism operation.

Another new special interest cruise, the New Airport Tour, has been
developed by the HKTA for aviation enthusiasts and those interested
in the massive new airport construction.

The tour takes passengers into roughly the same waters as Hong Kong
Dolphinwatch, passing under the nearly completed Tsing Ma Bridge
and around to the north side of Lantau.

A land section of the tour visits the old Kowloon Walled City site,
now a park, where jets can be seen flying low over the tops of
buildings, then to Lung Cheung Lookout where aircraft are viewed
landing and taking off from the Kai Tak runway.

Before boarding the boat, tourists are taken to the Chek Lap Kok
Airport Core Programme Exhibition Centre.

Watertours of Hong Kong is among those operators which will
organise the New Airport Tour on request for special groups.

Other new or improved water tours have added to Hong Kong's cruise
options.

While visitors can still enjoy Pearl of the Orient harbour cruises
by day or night, they can now spend more time exploring the 235
islands which surround Hong Kong.

Lantau Island is particularly favoured by the tour operators,
partly because it is a tranquil green contrast to Hong Kong, but
mainly because of the popularity of the Giant Buddha at Po Lin
Monastery and Tai O fishing village.

Both Watertours and HYFCO Travel Agency offer cruises to Lantau,
but Watertours has recently extended its Lantau trip to give people
the option of an overnight stay on the island.

Mr Edmund Tsang, general manager of Watertours, says that in the
past people visiting Lantau and Cheung Chau have asked to spend
more time looking around the island.

To meet the demand, he has modified two cruises. The Cheung Chau
Island Hopping Tour now enables passengers to spend 90 minutes
visiting the beach and historic sites on Cheung Chau, as compared
with just 40 minutes in the past, and gives people the option to
hop across to Lantau Island

On the "Romantic Lantau" trip, tourists can elect to stay a night
at Lantau's Silvermine Bay Hotel or hop across to Cheung Chau
Island.

Watertours also offers tailor-made cruises for groups. These
include trips to Lamma Island for hiking and a seafood dinner,
treasure hunt expeditions to the old pirate haunt on Cheung Chau,
and tours which couple inspections of the new airport
infrastructure with archaeological sites.

The cost of the New Airport Tour depends on group size and
itinerary. Watertours' Cheung Chau Island trip (without the Lantau
add on) is HK$310 (US$40).

The Lantau tour, without an overnight stay is HK$465 for adults,
including lunch. With an overnight stay, prices start at HK$850.

Visitors who prefer a little adventure and independence can
formulate their own itinerary and visit the islands for a fraction
of the organised tour prices.

HONG KONG: NEW PARK PLANS CONSIDERED

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AN exhibition and observation centre is being planned as a possible
addition to a new theme park in Hong Kong.

Ma Wan island is the site proposed for a theme park presenting the
history of Hong Kong and a south China fishing village. The island
is likely to be selected as the locale for a "film city" project
intended to be an Asian Universal Studios.

Ma Wan island is the location of one end of the Tsing Ma Bridge,
the world's longest suspension bridge built as part of the traffic
infrastructure for the new airport.

The Hong Kong Tourist Association is embarking on feasibility
studies and is in discussion with the Hong Kong government about
the various plans.

An option is to incorporate a site at Wok Tai Wan, providing an
observation point for one of Hong Kong's newest landmarks.

Meanwhile, Pearl of the Orient has two new destinations combining
Lantau Island and Tsing Ma Bridge. From Victoria Harbour, visitors
can visit the Po Lin Monastery and the Buddha on Lantau Island.

The Tsing Ma Bridge is the major sightseeing point during the trip.

HONG KONG: A BACK-FLIP ON ECO-TOURISM

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

IT is an extraordinary sight. On the edge of the dusty, flattened
tract of reclaimed land soon to become Hong Kong's new airport
runway, eight or nine curious dolphins surfaced by our boat.

Children and adults alike, poised with binoculars and cameras said
in chorus: "Wah! There they are again!"

I saw a six-year-old boy look at his father and exclaim: "It's even
better than the fireworks at Chinese New Year".

Environmentalist Mr Bill Leverett has been taking Hong Kong
residents on cruises around the north of Lantau island to see the
dolphins since March 1995. Only recently, with the help of the Hong
Kong Tourist Association (HKTA), has he begun marketing his tours
to international visitors.

"I wanted to raise awareness of the plight of the pink dolphins,
give them an economic value by helping them contribute to the
tourist economy, and generate revenue for research and campaigns,"
he said.

Hong Kong Dolphinwatch is one of the territory's few attempts at
eco-tourism. Passengers learn about the dolphin, how they are
endangered, and what can be done to help protect the marine
environment.

I was astonished that, while the dolphins are threatened by loss of
food, overfishing, pollution and boat traffic, Hong Kong
Dolphinwatch has about a 98 per cent success rate in sighting some
of the 80 to 200 dolphins which live in the area,

In less than 18 months, Hong Kong Dolphinwatch has taken about
3,500 people on dolphin-spotting trips.

There are two versions of the tour.

The one I took runs on Wednesdays, beginning with a 10.00 pick-up
at Queen's Pier, Central, and by the Star Ferry Pier in Tsim Sha
Tsui.

The comfortable pleasure cruise motored across the harbour under
the new Tsing Ma suspension bridge, then meandered slowly through
the waters near Chek Lap Kok on the lookout for the dolphins.

We sighted our first dolphin within a couple of hours of leaving
Central. We saw them in twos and threes at regular intervals, some
bone porcelain white, others a pinky colour.

After a large hot buffet lunch served on board, the boat was
surrounded by eight or nine dolphins.

On Sundays, the trip gives passengers more time near the dolphins,
with less time on the boat.

The weekend takes passengers from Tsim Sha Tsui by coach to Tuen
Mun, where a larger boat waits. Lunch is served at Tai O, the old
fishing village and tourist attraction on the north shore of
Lantau.

The tour costs HK$400 (US$52) per adult and HK$200 for children.

Mr Leverett contributes 10 per cent of proceeds from his cruises to
Hong Kong's Friends of the Earth Water Action Group.

Hong Kong Dolphinwatch also sells dolphin-related merchandise such
as tee-shirts, postcards and books.

Hong Kong Dolphinwatch can be contacted at tel: (852) 2984-1414,
fax: 2984-7799 and it can also be E-Mail: at dolphins@hk.super.net.

DEVELOPMENT PUSH FOR LANTAU

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE first thing most visitors to Hong Kong see as their aircraft
swings over the new Chek Lap Kok airport development is the Giant
Buddha on Lantau Island.

Most see no more of the Buddha or Lantau, but those who take the
time to explore this island and stay longer than the standard
organised day tour are generally rewarded with an experience of
Hong Kong beyond the cliches of tourist brochures.

Lantau is twice the size of Hong Kong Island. At present, only
eight per cent of all visitors to Hong Kong - and 18 per cent of
visitors from mainland China (now Hong Kong's largest and fastest
growing visitor market) - take a trip to Lantau. Most of these
visitors see little more than the Giant Buddha at Po Lin Monastery
and Tai O fishing village.

The Hong Kong Tourist Association's (HKTA) major Visitor and
Tourism Study (Vistour), which outlines the NTO's strategies for
the future of tourism in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, recommends the south-west part of Lantau be officially
classified as "Leisure Island".

The study recognises the appeal of the island's mountain scenery,
attractive coastal areas and its open environment. It also notes
that accessibility to Lantau is about to be radically altered by
the creation of new infrastructure serving the airport on its north
side which will link the island by rail and road to Kowloon and
Hong Kong.

Fortunately for Lantau, and the quality of life of Hong Kong
residents who enjoy the island on weekends, the HKTA does not
recommend all out tourist development. It recognises that there is
a fine line between giving the greatest number of people access to
the island and retaining the tranquil, green environment which is
central to the island's appeal.

Plans for the island include a cable car link between the township
of Tung Chung - formerly a small, remote fishing village on the
north side of the island which has grown in the past couple of
years into a thriving settlement servicing the airport construction
teams - to Ngong Ping (Lantau Peak).

 The project, which would be relatively inoffensive to the natural
environment, would enable easier access to the Giant Buddha and the
surrounding country park trails.

The government says it will not develop the present one-lane road
connecting Tung Chung with the southern part of the island.

The HKTA notes the increased number of people likely to use
Lantau's country parks and landscape protection areas would need to
be monitored.

"Any new development would need to be very carefully considered and
sited," the Vistour study said.

Nonetheless, the HKTA does propose a resort-style hotel near Po Lin
Monastery, possibly in conjunction with a golf course at Tung
Chung.

It is worth discovering Lantau Island, with its ancient forts, old
fishing villages and serene hillsides before the new airport is
completed (due in the first half of 1998) and whatever changes are
due to take place - well thought out or accidental, good or bad -
alter the character of the island and bring it into the 21st
century.

HIGH AIRPORT INVESTMENT

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

HONG KONG - Asia/Pacific hubs face radical change as extended-range
twinjets allow point-to-point flights to overfly traditional
transfer points, according to a leading regional aviation boss.

Mr John Mok, head of strategic planning for the Airport Authority
of Hong Kong, has predicted "the Asia/Pacific region alone will
need up to US$200 billion in airport infrastructure investment by
2010 to keep pace with traffic growth".

He said high capital costs in Asia/Pacific are a function of high
demand forecasts - 400 million passengers over the next 15 years,
more than half the world's total.

"Asia/Pacific is investing more in the development of its aviation
infrastructure than any other region in the world today," he said.

"However, it is in Asia/ Pacific where the competition for funds to
build a broad spectrum of infrastructure...is also the greatest.

"The potential risk of inadequate funding for airport development
will only grow in the future."

DE LIMA TO CLOSE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

LANGKAWI - De Lima Resort, the island's largest resort, will cease
operations on September 15.

A short statement by its owner, Accruvest Hotel Management, said
that the resort would be closed for "major renovation" and that
future plans were being drawn up.

De Lima Resort, envisioned to be Langkawi's "most affordable
holiday hideaway" comprising 1,500 rooms, is operating only 100
rooms.

Standard and superior rooms have been priced between RM60.50
(US$24) and RM110.

TTG Asia understands that the resort will be closed for more than a
year in view of the extensive renovation works.

In its place will be a four-star hotel based on a Japanese concept.

There are plans to either rebuild or upgrade the chalets and
bungalows, which were built in a record 53 days during phase one of
development in 1992.

Mr Peter Mueller, chief executive officer of Kuala Lumpur-based
Granite Hotels & Resorts (GHR) which manages De Lima Resort, said
the 430 staff would be "terminated" and not retrenched as reported
by some media.

They include Mr Mohanadas Kumaran and Mr Ibrahim Nordin, who were
recently appointed general manager and resident manager
respectively.

Mr Mueller does not foresee any problems relocating the staff to
other hotels, particularly in Langkawi, in view of tight labour
problem that is affecting the whole country.

As for tour agencies such as Sala Tours & Travel Agency who have
made bookings earlier with De Lima Resort and prepaid them, these
bookings will be upgraded to the five-star sister property
Langasuka Resort's (LR) deluxe rooms and above.

A deluxe room at LR costs RM165.

HOTELS FEAR PHONE SURCHARGE CUT

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Virginia Saunders

JAKARTA - Hoteliers fear telephone surcharges are to be cut to keep
pace with Singapore's move to lower telecommunications charges.

Surcharges in Singapore hotels will be cut to S$0.30 (US$0.21) for
each direct call or fax to Malaysia from January. Current
surcharges in Indonesia range from 25 to 50 per cent

Concern has been heightened after a ministerial decree increased
rates on international long distance telephone calls from Batam to
Singapore.

The new Indonesian rate from September 1 increased Batam to
Singapore calls to Rp1,300 a minute (US$0.52) from Rp1,000. Outside
Batam, the calling rate to Singapore from any point in Indonesia is
Rp2,600 per minute. Calls from Singapore to Batam are S$0.50 per
minute, and S$1.80 per minute to other points in Indonesia.

The new rate and the current surcharges make calls from Indonesian
hotels one of the most expensive within the ASEAN region. Although
there are discounted hours, the state-owned domestic
telecommunications provider, PT Telkom, has changed the period when
50 and 75 per cent discounts apply on long distance calls.

Telkom offers 50 per cent discount on long distance calls between
18.00 and 21.00.

Discounted calls of 75 per cent have been moved from 21.00-06.00 to
23.00-08.00. Hotel surcharges are 25 per cent to 50 per cent more
than the normal rate for long distance calls.

PT Telkom said the decision to change was caused by a strong demand
for long distance calls after 21.00, which has "surpassed the
capacity of Telkom network facilities".

Long distance calls from 06.00-09.00 and from 15.00-18.00 are
subject to normal tariffs.

In 1994, Casa Grande, a group of Jakarta hoteliers, was able to
defer a plan by the ministry of telecommunications to regulate
surcharges on phone calls at a lower rate than that imposed by
hotels.

Most Jakarta hotels levy a surcharge of 45 to 50 per cent while
other provinces, including Bali, add 25 per to all hotel calls.

Jakarta hoteliers said they have not received any complaints from
guests over the surcharges. However, with the increase in telephone
rates and with surcharges being arbitrary, hoteliers are concerned
that they may be asked to reduce their surcharges to make doing
business in Indonesia more competitive.

One hotelier told TTG Asia calls from Singapore have been reduced
to a bare minimum "because they feel it will attract the MICE
market, now that there is a decline in tourist arrivals to
Singapore".

But, Inter-Continental says, this will not replace travel agents.

"Introducing on-line reservations via Travel Web shows we see the

does not mean we will see our travel agents as any less important,"
said Mr Michael Stajdel, senior vice-president of marketing and

of what to do in the destination, check the latest weather, and
print their clients a copy to take away."

NEW CYBERNOMICS THREAT TO TRAVEL AGENTS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

CYBERNOMICS - the convergence of technical and economic
undercurrents - is changing the way the travel industry does
business and, in the process, threatening the livelihood of travel
agents," cautions Mr Chris Lyle, chief of the economics and
statistics branch of the International Civil Aviation Organisation
(ICAO).

The costs to air carriers of using a CRS as a distribution channel
have come into the limelight recently. Cost levels are increasing,
and new forms of charges such as cancellation fees have arisen.

"Due to the economic undercurrents, airlines, hotels and other
travel service companies will choose to have fewer travel agents,
pay less commissions and move towards greater direct sales through
various automation options.

"Technology is increasing the capability for leaving the travel
agent - and even the CRS - out of the distribution chain entirely,"
Mr Lyle said.

For example, the method of selling airline tickets - through a CRS
or on-line service - is changing.

Airlines such as Lufthansa - which is using CD-ROMs - and Alitalia,
British Airways/ USAir, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Swissair and
United - which use diskettes - are either giving access to a CRS
via an airline server or direct access to the airline's individual
reservation system.

On the hotel side, Hilton is now distributing CD-ROMs to facilitate
Internet booking.

"Next, you have the recent substantive entrances into marketing
through World Wide Web sites on the Internet, as well as by many
other travel services.

"Currently, more than 100 major airlines from 62 countries have Web
sites. Further, US-based airlines have responded to the economic
undercurrents by placing a commission cap on domestic fares," said
Mr Lyle.

"After considerable initial fuss, the concept now seems to have
taken a firm foothold in the US. The first year of the cap is
reported to have produced an improvement in the bottom line of US
airlines to the tune of about US$400 million, no significant change
in market share between airlines imposing the cap and other
airlines, and a significant but not earth-shattering increase in
the number of closings of travel agents."

Not surprisingly, therefore, airlines outside the US are
considering similar action. More than one European airline is
reducing overrides and incentive payments.

Lufthansa has already announced it will be reducing basic levels of
commission where electronic ticketing is concerned. SAS has
effectively reduced commission via the SAS Travel Plan, a form of
electronic season pass, and start-up carrier EasyJet in Europe
appears to be taking the ValuJet approach to commissions, that is,
avoiding them if possible.

Another quirk in the commission structure is that at least one
airline in the US is now offering a bigger commission for booking
outside a CRS than when using a CRS.

While the CRS will stay in a focal role for some time, Mr Lyle
believes there will be a greater use of other travel distribution
channels that are now becoming available along with greater
interaction amongst these channels.

"One particular benefit of the evolution of new distribution
channels, notably the Internet, has been to sharpen the competitive
edge of the incumbents and the CRS."

Are we seeing the beginning of the end of the travel agent? Mr Lyle
thinks this seems unlikely.

"First, travel agents provide a much broader and often much more
personalised service to passengers than the airlines do directly.

"They are not tied to an individual supplier and offer expert (and
hopefully impartial) advice on different carriers, fares and
routings, different hotels and different car hire companies, just
to name a few products, and agents can themselves offer benefits.
For example, a franchising chain already has a frequent traveller
award programme.

"Second, sonic travel agency chains have major purchasing power and
are able to negotiate private fares with the airlines, passing on
at least some of the savings to their clients.

"They are acting as consolidators as well as agents. Thus, there is
no reason why a travel agent cannot make greater use of the
Internet to serve these clients."

Consequently, while there is likely to be some sort of shake-out,
coupled with more intensive consolidation into consortia or
franchising networks, travel agents appear to be here to stay
because of the value-added services they provide.

"However, the surviving agent will be aggressively automated, in a
niche market or part of a chain, and, most importantly, client
driven," said Mr Lyle.

NEW LIFE TO EVENT WHICH MAINTAINS ITS INTEGRITY

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

PATA's recent acquisition of VUSAMART, a three-day fair for North
American inbound traffic from September 9-12, gave new life to the
event's educational dimension but kept its original integrity of a
"business marketplace" intact, said show founder and PATA director
for the Americas, Mr Richard Valerio.

"When you have an organisation with one mind running it, mine,
there's always a limit," Mr Valerio told TTG Asia.

PATA broadens the event's educational scope and educates the
American market on Asia/Pacific trends before it is too late, he
said, citing a speech during the PATA marketing conference on the
growing economies and travel patterns of the Asia/Pacific.

"Now we have people who can deliver a real message, something
people can chew on," he said.

Mr Bill Hastings, PATA director-communications, added: "PATA brings
a global creditability, certainly a high level with Asians and
provides us with more opportunities (with companies) who have been
traditionally outbound operators in the Pacific Asia."

The reality is Asians like big cities, but new niche markets of
younger travellers are emerging, said Mr Valerio.

In October, he and PATA president and CEO, Mr Lakshman Ratnapala,
are meeting the Mexican minister of tourism to discuss ways to
develop infrastructure and marketing capabilities suited to the
Asia/Pacific region.

Travel to South America remains limited due in part to a lack of
air lift.

Mr Valerio has met industry leaders in Brazil, Argentina and Chile
to discuss ways forward.

MYSTERY OF ABSENT FRIENDS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

Travel planners from Australia, New Zealand and India were not to
be found in the halls of the Walt Disney World Resort convention
hall at this year's 11th annual VUSAMART.

Australia and New Zealand, invited for the first time this year,
were not in participation possibly due to short notice.

Mr Richard Valerio, PATA director for the Americas, began talking
with their national carriers in January to assist him in
identifying qualified companies.

India's absence, on the other hand, remains a mystery.

In 1994, one Indian company attended, followed by an additional
three last year. This year, not one graced the theme park city of
Orlando.

"Why not here? I wish I had the answer. Hopefully the Indian press
will take 'em and shake 'em," said Mr Valerio.

He remained optimistic of the nation's potential as an inbound
market to North America. "The India market is certain to explode
and when they're ready, we'll be ready."

SPOTLIGHT ON USTTA OPTIONS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE American government and private sector are looking at a number
of options following the demise of the United States Travel and
Tourism Association (USTTA), the country's national tourism
organisation, earlier this year.

One proposal is for a council along the lines of a privately-funded
NTO, said PATA director for the Americas, Mr Richard Valerio.

If approved, its establishment is still not expected for a further
two years.

PRAISE FOR TWO-WAY TOURISM

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

PATA officials defended the association's so-called "two-way
tourism" policy against criticism this year from those who
questioned whether it was an appropriate activity.

"Two-way tourism is an evolutionary process which some people have
been ignoring," said Mr Richard Valerio, PATA director for the
Americas.

"If we are suggesting to be a global society, you can't expect an
association to be isolated. The voice of the Pacific is not only
one-way."

Reaction to PATA's promotion of two-way tourism has been positive,
but some who have disagreed have spoken loudly and attracted
attention, said PATA director of communications, Mr Bill Hastings.

PATA's charter is to promote travel to and within Pacific Asia and
certainly the North America continent is within the PATA region, Mr
Hastings told TTG Asia, pulling out a PATA brochure with the North
American continent, including Canada, the US and Mexico clearly in
view.

"Unless we adjust to the change in the marketplace, we are not
providing the services we are here for."

ASIAN MARKETS POSE A CHALLENGE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

North Americans at the PATA marketing conference on September 10
were told Asian markets are complex and the US faces competition
with attractive Asian destinations.

In his "Marketing Segmentation in Asia" presentation, Mr Brian
Deeson, president and CEO of Century International Hotels in Hong
Kong, selected five "lesser-known" Asian countries, including
India, Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan, to highlight as
examples of complexity.

He said: "Travel patterns are like ripples on a pond. People tend
to travel firstly within a very small radius from their own home
and then to increasingly remoter destinations as their
sophistication and spending capability increases.

"This means that by the time an Asian traveller hits North America,
he or she has probably already had several trips within Asia and
therefore, in relative terms, is quite a sophisticated traveller."

On India, a vast country frequently overlooked by its Asian
neighbours, Mr Deeson noted: "There are an estimated 300 million
Indians who could be classified as middleclass and thus have the
ability to travel outside the country as their lifestyles improve.
The market potential is therefore enormous."

Indian expenditure first goes to appliances, then cars and thirdly
travel, he said, adding that the greatest hindrance to increased
overseas travel has been a lack of international connections.

Mr Deeson was upbeat on "the recommencement of around-the-world
flights by United Airlines, taking in Delhi on a daily basis and
thus linking it to Europe and North America via Hong Kong".

On the Korean market, one of North America's most important in
Asia, Mr Deeson said overseas travel is fashionable and the desire
and means for such a leisure activity is spread throughout the
country.

Prospects for growth are good. The 1996 forecast for departures
varied from 4.2 to 4.5 million and double-digit growth per year
will be sustained until the year 2000.

Travel remains dominated by group tours.

"Korea is only what one operator termed 'flirting' with FIT
travel," he said.

Growth from Singapore, which on a per capita basis has the highest
number of travellers in the world, is expected to reach a plateau
by the turn of the century due to its small population. From 1991
to 1995, the number of visitors to the US grew marginally from
57,000 to 88,000.

"While the overall market will not grow, there are tremendous
opportunities for growing target niche-market segments," noted Mr
Deeson.

Thailand was also highlighted as "one of the more advanced
developing countries in Asia" with a population exceeding 60
million.

Thai traffic to the US doubled from 1991 at 47,000 to 94,000 last
year.

As for Taiwan, similar in some travel habits to Koreans and
Japanese, the over-50 crowd took a million trips abroad in 1994 and
are greatly influenced by what tour operators are featuring.

MIXED VIEWS OVER PULL-OUT

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

REACTIONS to the announced pull-out of the Canadian Tourism
Commission from PATA were mixed at the annual VUSAMART.

Mr Randy Ng, manager of Classic Holidays Tour & Travel of
Vancouver, said the decision will have a "spiritual effect" on the
Asian market.

"Before (Tourism Canada was a PATA member), people didn't think
Canada belonged to the Pacific Rim, but with PATA there's a sense
of belonging," Mr Ng told TTG Asia.

"Asians think Canada is cold, in the North Pole. But when with
PATA, they think it's part of the Pacific. It's easier to sell."

Representatives of two other Canadian-based travel companies
believed Tourism Canada paid so little attention to Asian markets
that the move will have virtually no impact.

"The influence will not be that crucial as far as the Asia/ Pacific
market is concerned because most Canadian operators have their own
connections and do their own sales trips," said Ms Cynthia Lau,
deputy general manager of TourLink Holidays, which focuses on the
Thai, Malaysian and Singaporean markets.

She said the national tourist office does not see Thailand and
Malaysia as potential markets, only as a surplus, "something like a
dessert".

Mr Raymond Chu, sales manager of Royal Canadian Travel of Ontario,
whose major market is Thailand, agreed: "Even though they pulled
out of PATA, we still sell to the Orient. We have our own
clientele.

"Those agents don't care if it's PATA or not PATA. As long as you
offer good service and good price, they give you business."

Last month, Tourism Canada announced the NTO was not renewing its
membership of PATA, citing a lack of sufficient benefits.

The organisation has a grace period until July 1, 1997, when
membership fees are due again.

THUMBS UP FOR PATA'S FIRST US FAIR

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

ASIA/Pacific travel buyers expressed general approval for PATA's
first attempt at running VUSAMART.

Mr Warren Ho, director of Ambience Holidays of Singapore, a GSA
operator and wholesaler, said the show was well-organised and
precise.

He said: "Not much time is wasted. We made a few good contacts and
renewed old contacts."

Of the new contacts, Mr Ho met mostly hotel chains and convention
bureaus which are not represented in Singapore.

"It is good to get feedback on how they are operating and it's good
for information gathering."

Ambience Holidays' primary focus is on the main gateways to the US.

Ms Rolland Cheng, a manager at Shangri-La Holidays Travel Lines of
San Francisco, said she had found new products.

As a ground handler of 50,000 to 60,000 people a year mainly from
Taiwan and a few South-east Asian countries, Ms Cheng said her
clients would be interested in Cancun in Mexico, and New Orleans.

"Normally, people stay on the west or east coast, so it's good to
know about these places," she said.

With little first-hand experience in New Orleans, she was
enthusiastic to learn about the casinos there.

Ms Cynthia Lim, senior outbound manager of Ho Wah Genting Travels
of Kuala Lumpur, said most of her previous groups have visited Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas.

But after her first attendance at VUSAMART, she planned to also
promote Orlando and New York. While her clients to California have
seen Disney World and Universal Studios in action, Orlando also
offers Pleasure Island, an attraction she considered to be a hit
with her younger guests.

Although she had spoken with several hotels and ground agents, Ms
Lim was not looking for direct hotel contacts as she brought in
only two to three groups to the US per month and had a ground
handler to make all hotel arrangements.

She will be back next year to follow the trends.

Mr Kim Young-sun, president of The Korea Times Travel of Seoul,
said: "First I'm here to meet old friends, to exchange opinions and
to promote common interests."

Mr Kim was disappointed at not seeing everyone he had hoped would
attend the Orlando event.

CRUISE CALL TO THAILAND

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

BANGKOK - Thailand should develop its cruise industry and create
all-inclusive resort deals if it wants more of the US outbound
market, according to the US travel agents' top official.

American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA) president and CEO, Ms
Jeanne Epping, made these observations as ASTA prepared for its
World Congress in Bangkok from October 6-12.

She also noted that the biggest obstacle to overcome for Americans
travelling to Thailand is flight time and cost, although the
country offers some of the region's best prices.

Ms Epping told TTG Asia the Thai government needed "to develop its
cruise industry and encourage more ships to cruise its island and
look to all-inclusive resort pricing in special packages like those
offered by Hawaiian and Caribbean suppliers".

She added: "It should also offer more off-season pricing packages".

If all goes well during the World Congress, she predicted Thailand
could become Asia's top destination for Americans.

ASTA research claims previous host countries have experienced an
increase in arrivals between 10 and 40 per cent after hosting the
congress.

Last year, 328,000 Americans visited Thailand.

SINGAPOREANS GOING FOR ECO-TOURS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Natalie Chen

SINGAPORE - More Singaporeans are opting for eco-adventure tours
with the market for such holidays ready to jump by 50-60 per cent
this year, said Mr Chang Theng Hwee, managing director of Country
Holidays Travel.

He estimated the niche market was still relatively small, making up
less than five per cent of the Singaporean outbound market.

But the Singaporean market for eco-adventure tours is the largest
in South-east Asia due to the population's environmental awareness.

"There are even less operators in this line which allows for our
growth in the local market," said Mr Chang.

Mr Benny Ng, assistant tour manager of Country Holidays Travel,
said the "hip to be green trend" has contributed to the popularity
of tours.

"Most of our clients like to know that their dollars are helping to
save the environment and the local indigenous population," he said.

Mr Chang said eco-adventure tours are a few hundred dollars more
expensive than standard packages.

Popular extras include visiting a private game park and having
meals prepared by their own cooks. The idea of exclusiveness and
hygiene appeal to consumers' tastes and they are prepared to pay
for quality.

Mr Ng said: "For eco-adventure tours, you can't be cheap because it
affects the quality and aim of such travel."

Mr Chang said a key reason for growth was that clients belonged to
the upmarket category.

"Even with the economic slowdown we are not affected because our
clients can afford the tours."

But he said the danger of eco-adventure tours lay in the abuse of
the term. He said: "Anyone can organise an 'eco-adventure' tour but
they may not carry out environmentally friendly practices."

He cited trekkers to the Himalayas, who used firewood instead of
kerosene, hence contributing to deforestation.

JAKARTA HOTEL NAME CHANGE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

JAKARTA - Hotel Equatorial Jakarta has changed its name to
Millenium Sirih Jakarta after CDL Hotels Group, owners of Millenium
Hotels and Resorts, took an 80 per cent majority ownership from
former owner Tanah Abang.

Agents and operators' contracts and agreements will be honoured,
according to the hotel.

General manager, Mr Alfred Portenschlager, is no longer affiliated
with Hotel Equatorial after receiving a notice of termination when
Millenium's management revealed plans to bring over a new team
starting September 15.

A new general manager, Mr Joseph Khong, will be installed,
replacing acting general manager, Mr Klaus Doehling.

Mr Portenschlager has joined Santika Hotels, an Indonesian company,
as general manager and corporate technical assistant director.

He will be responsible for the opening of the four-star 320-room
Jakarta Santika in the third quarter of 1997.

This is the third name change for Hotel Equatorial, which started
out as Grand Metro Equatorial.

ANA FLAT OUT FOR SUCCESS

TOKYO - All Nippon Airways (ANA) is claiming high acclaim from
first class passengers with the introduction of a new seat on its
Boeing 747s.

The hi-tech seat, developed by ANA in co-ordination with France's
leading aeroplane seat maker Sicma for nine months, is designed to
recline 180 degrees at the touch of a button.

The aptly named "Full Flat Seat" has been introduced aboard the
first class cabins of the B747-400 jets, in operation for long-haul
services. A spokesman said load factors have risen to 60 per cent
per flight on these services from 30 per cent previously.

AUSTRALIA: SINGLE AIR MARKET GOAL

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

AUCKLAND - Air New Zealand's NZ$544 million (US$370 million) buy
into Ansett Australia will bring the proposed Australasian single
aviation market a step closer to reality, opening up new
opportunities for Asia's travel trade.

Air New Zealand chief executive, Mr Jim McCrea, assuming approval
from the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board and endorsement
by shareholders at a special meeting on September 27, said: "Once
this investment is made, the governments would then consider their
next step to harmonisation and rationalisation of the current
rules."

Over the past two years, the trans-Tasman aviation market has been
progressively deregulated, although wholly Australian-owned Ansett
New Zealand has been flying domestically in New Zealand since 1987.

Mr McCrea believes the next step is to allow any New Zealand or
Australian carrier to operate freely across the Tasman Sea and
within each other's countries.

"But it's up to the governments to negotiate that arrangement."

Mr McCrea said that as well as sharing in Ansett Australia's
domestic business, Air New Zealand could become involved in
international expansion through Ansett International, which already
flies to Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and Taiwan.

He said: "I am delighted. It hasn't sunk in yet. Some of us have
spent...in excess of two years on this thing, every day of the
week.

"It's going to be very, very good for New Zealand and Australia.
It's going to be very, very good for Air New Zealand. And it's
going to be very, very good for Ansett."

It is looking at how it can integrate its fleet with Australian
domestic services and market them together.

ASIANS WOOED WITH OUTBACK DEAL

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Margie T Logarta

ADELAIDE - South Australia is hoping a unique cultural event will
put it on the tourism map in key Asian markets.

"Opera in the Outback" in the Flinders Ranges from September 18-21
next year may just lure Asians to venture into unknown territory.

The first concert, staged in 1988 to mark Australia's bicentennial,
attracted an audience of 9,300. The latest venture, featuring Dame
Kiri Te Kanawa, is expected to lure 12,500.

Some 2,000 seats have been reserved for international visitors.

The spectacle will be staged in Yalkarinha Gorge, whose magnificent
hills and towering gum trees provide a stunning backdrop.

Next year's presentation has been expanded to include a colourful
range of activities by surrounding communities, including train
rides on the historic Pichi Richi Railway in restored steam
locomotives, rodeos, country music concerts, sheep shearing, native
story-telling, bush tucker meals and open-air vintage theme parties
with live classical quartet.

The only Asians to have travelled through the South Australian
outback have been Japanese in rented cars or motorbikes on their
way to other states.

"They haven't been aware of what they can actually do," said Mr
David Tarr, chairperson, Flinders Ranges and Outback Tourism South
Australia.

He said Opera in the Outback gave Asians the ideal introduction to
an area millions of years old and teeming with incredible wildlife.
"They can see kangaroos, emus, eagles and reptiles while getting a
package which doesn't force them to go out of their safety zone."

Mr Scott Ireland, In Front Management director and ex-Singapore
resident, said although Singaporeans remained fascinated by Sydney
and the Gold Coast, a small but increasing number were realising
there was more to Australia than cities and beaches.

"If you were to combine an interesting cultural product, a bit of
wilderness, a bit of cold weather and lots of hands-on options,
then South Australia offers great potential," he said.

The Opera in the Outback packages start from A$360 (US$290) to
A$690.

LAOS' TRAGIC LOSS A LESSON FOR INDUSTRY

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

THE death of Claude Vincent serves as a grim reminder of the
potential pitfalls of travelling in the emerging tourism markets of
former Indochina.

A dangerous cocktail of war, weaponry and poverty in Laos
contributed to this senseless act of violence that cost Mr Vincent
his life. This is a scenario that has played itself all to often in
Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar and at times even Thailand.

We are often reminded that this can easily happen in New York or in
Europe, and cases of Asian visitors slain on trips to North America
are not unknown.

But that knowledge does little to soften the loss.

Few foreigners, in Laos, or in other countries in the region have
done more for their adopted country than Mr Vincent.

He was fond of saying that Laos was his country, his people, and he
worked with a passion that showed his commitment to his adopted
land.

After moving to Laos, he was one of only five or six expatriates
who stayed on after the liberation of Vientiane in 1975.

Having started a tour company in the early 1970s, he continued to
operate tours for visiting dignitaries heading to Vietnam until a
Vietnamese Embassy opened in 1977.

From 1977 untill 1989 he worked in trading coffee and in the
transportation industry, which opened his eyes to the beauty of
southern Laos, where several of Sodetour's lodges are located.

After returning to tourism with the Lao National Tourism Company in
1989, Mr Vincent started Sodetour in 1992, and the network of
lodges soon followed.

He was active in forming the Tourism Development Coalition in 1993
and was well know in the foreign community as a liaison between
Laotians and westerners.

This sad event should make the industry as a whole pause for
thought as operators rush into expanding markets. Concerns over
people's safety and security should never exceed the need to buy
and sell travel.

His passing also serves as a reminder of the dangers of tourism
expanding faster than the infrastructure and national development
in countries around the region.

LAO AVIATION STRUGGLES

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

VIENTIANE - Lao Aviation's new management team from joint-venture
partner China Yunnan Airlines is struggling to improve service and
bring the national carrier into the black one year after taking
over the reins.

Low load factors and local agents' expressed reluctance to sell the
airline leave several unanswered questions.

The Vientiane-Chiang Mai route is only running in the 30 per cent
range.

Nevertheless, Lao Aviation will still lease a second B737-200
(delivered on November 1) from the US and apply to fly to Hong
Kong, Macau, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Flights from Vietiane to
Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh and Phnom Penh will be added.

FEE BATTLE LOOMING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Gina Putong

HONG KONG - Travel agents are hoping airlines will not resort to
raising air fares too high to buffer major increases in charges at
Chek Lap Kok airport.

Airlines and travel agents are waiting on the airport authority to
announce the cost structure for landing and other fees at Chek Lap
Kok.

P & O manager, Ms Irene Law, said she understood there should be a
premium for using a new airport such as Chek Lap Kok.

Ms Law said: "Although we have heard about the expected increased
rates for the new airport, it is still too early to say how much
airfares would be hiked. The question we ask is, to what extent?"

Mr Terence Wong, manager of Hong Thai Citizens Travel Services,
said travel agents would not worry about hiked rates.

He said air fares would not be able to climb too high as there
would be heightened competition as more airlines used the new
airport.

Another industry source believed that airlines had inherent
structures to provide leeway for such increases.

"Airlines will have to do cost-altering in other aspects of their
operations to balance off the increase so that it will not cause
air fare hikes which are too high," he said.

He believed that Hong Kong's airport would continue to be strategic
for airlines compared to neighbouring airports in China and Macau.

Various Asian airlines want to see at least some of the airport
authority's books before agreeing to pay higher charges for Chek
Lap Kok.

Orient Airlines Association, the major regional representative
airline body, warned of the detrimental effects the hiked rates
would have on airlines and travellers.

Mr Richard Stirland, director-general of the association, said the
news was "extremely disturbing for airlines and bad news for
travellers".

Mr Stirland expected a negative impact on tourism and trade to be
the result.

He said it was idle to assume airlines could simply absorb such an
increase without either passing it on to passengers through higher
fares or re-examining the economics of all services to Hong Kong.

AGENTS CAN WIN GAMES EXCLUSIVE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Laura Lee

KUALA LUMPUR - Travel agents are being promised a share of the
action by the company which has been appointed to handle hotel
reservations for the Commonwealth Games in 1998.

Sukom Accommodation Bureau (SAB) '98, a specialised department set
up between organisers Sukom Ninety Eight and the UK-based Byrom
Consultants to organise lodging for visitors to the games, is not
designed to take away business from travel agencies.

Sukom Ninety Eight executive chairman, Gen (R) Tan Sri Hashim Mohd
Ali, told TTG Asia that SAB '98's role was a complementary one.

It would not have a monopoly over room bookings for the
Commonwealth Games as organisers want to avoid sky-high prices.

An estimated 6,000 rooms, ranging from dormitory-style to five-star
suites, have been selected from 44 hotels in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor
and Langkawi. Properties include: Hotel Istana; The Legend Hotel &
Apartments; Hotel Nikko; New World Hotel; Swiss Garden Hotel;
Renaissance Palm Garden; Sheraton Subang Hotel; Sunway Lagoon
Resort Hotel; Burau Bay Resort; and Radisson Tanjung Rhu.

Byrom Consultants event manager, Mr Jaime Byrom, praised Sukom
Ninety Eight for its early preparations.

He said: "We find Sukom Ninety Eight the most dynamic organising
committee that we have come across so far.

"We never had a brochure done two years before the event."

OPERATORS HAIL BEIJING'S DRIVE TO RAISE STANDARDS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

HONG KONG - A nation-wide drive to monitor and remedy tourism
problems has got the thumbs up from China inbound travel agents
raring to see better business in the mainland.

Travel agents are lauding the National Tourism Administration's
service quality supervision system to promote standard service
within the country's tourism sector, which they say is gaining good
ground since its implementation this June.

"Efforts like these are going to bring in good business for us in
the long run," said Ms Eva Lai of Swire Travel.

Apart from getting less complaints from clients, she has noticed
that travellers are feeling more confident about going on a holiday
to the mainland.

But she said Chinese authorities should pay attention to details
when implementing measures.

Patterson Travel Service director, Mr Ling Kam Man, said that in
the past two years, service from travel agents and hotels has been
a lot better than before, especially with new five-star hotels
opening.

HAWAII EYES VISA WAIVER

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

SEOUL - The state of Hawaii is pushing hard for a visa waiver for
Korean tourists visiting the US.

"Hawaii is now working very hard on the issue of waiving visas for
Koreans," said Mr Kazumasa Tamura, vice-president of the Asia &
Pacific division of the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau.
"There is strong official support in Hawaii among the governor and
senators."

Mr Tamura, who was in town for the Korean World Travel Fair
recently, said he expected the number of Koreans visiting Hawaii to
triple if visas were waived.

In 1995, 100,000 Koreans visited Hawaii.

However, Mr Paul Linneman, information officer at the US Embassy in
Seoul, said the law states clearly that a waiver can only be
considered if the rate of visa refusals for a country is less than
two per cent.

"Currently, between five and seven per cent of Korean applicants
are refused visas and this clearly falls outside the current
guidelines."

The US began the visa-waiver system in 1989 and among the first
beneficiaries were the UK and Japan.

HONG KONG: TRADE DOES NOT FEAR NET

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Gina Putong and Susie Zanardi

HONG KONG - Travel agents here are confident that direct airline
booking via the Internet will not threaten their livelihood.

"Although customers may book their tickets for simple travel plans
through the Internet, travel agents need not view this development
through wary eyes," said Mr Wyn Li, KLM sales and marketing manager
for China, Hong Kong and Macau.

"There will always be an important role for travel agents in the
scheme of things. The more complicated holiday plans will entail
different itineraries and flight schedules from various airports,
which customers don't have the patience for, even if the
information may be available to them," he said.

For such service, the customer will still turn to the travel agent.

Mr Li was commenting on a recent announcement by Dutch airline KLM
that limited ticket booking service for its flights would be
available via the Internet. Cathay Pacific Airways also said it was
keen to sell tickets on the Net within the next two years.

Mr Richard Willis, regional director and general manager of P&O
Travel, encouraged travel agents to embrace these technological
advancements as they would come fast and slick. "Most travellers
cannot handle the complex fare structures and won't really have
access to all the comparative airline fares and schedules," he
said.

Going on the Net, he said, would only serve to highlight the travel
agent's role as consultant and "custodian of the client".

"It would only be a threat if travel agents become complacent and
fail to face up to technology," said Mr Willis.

Ms Ridy Suen, leisure travel manager for Thomas Cook, said that the
Internet could be turned into an advantage for the agent. "On our
part, we have begun packaging holiday destinations - which include
air fare, accommodations and other services - and made them
available on our Web site and the response has been very good."

But Mr David Ho, managing director of Sime Travel in Singapore,
said: "Whether it is KLM or any other airline, the moment it
infiltrates into customer fares, it will affect agents. But those
who need other services will still go to agents."

Mr James Reinnoldt, Northwest regional managing director for South-
east Asia and Greater China, said: "In Internet sales, airlines
find the customers. The agent only issues the tickets. But for the
full range of service provided by agents, we will still pay the
full nine per cent."

JAKARTA RATES STILL FALLING

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

JAKARTA - Five-star Gran Melia's opening salvo of US$145 per night
could change the way the market looks at Jakarta hotels.

Now suffering from a high inventory of hotel rooms, with more to
open in 1997, Jakarta's hotel rates have been on a downward spin
for a few months, though some continue to maintain US$200 a night.

Hoteliers have been closely monitoring Gran Melia, which soft-
opened in July. Its opening rates have had an impact on hotels
within the "golden triangle" - the confluence of three major
avenues in Jakarta.

Some four-star hotels feared it could be disastrous for them if
Gran Melia opened with US$139 a night, while some five-star
properties said they would hurt if the opening rate was less than
US$169.

Gran Melia general manager, Mr Eberhard Linke, told TTG Asia: "We
must be realistic. We do not live in Utopia. We know the market and
what it can do".

Mr. Patrick Fiat, general manager of Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, said
he is monitoring Gran Melia's pricing strategy.

"If they go down that will pull down everybody - Holiday Inn,
Mandarin, Hilton, and Regent," he said.

SINGAPORE: ATTRACTIONS DISTRACTIONS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Margie T Logarta

SINGAPORE - Dwindling visitor numbers have prompted the Association
of Singapore Attractions (ASA) to organise a series of workshops to
educate members about the needs of inbound markets.

A survey by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB), showed an
11.2 per cent decrease in entries to tourism attractions in 1994,
attributed to keen regional competition and shorter stays. In 1995,
the figure improved to only a 1.5 per cent drop due to rock-bottom
prices.

ASA chairman, Mr Francis Phun, said the seminars will prepare the
organisation for aggressive promotions.

He said: "We had some sales missions in the past but the results
were not fantastic. We are now in the process of taking stock of
ourselves so we will know how to reposition ourselves better."

Speakers will include chief executives of some of ASA's member
organisations and travel specialists who will share insights on
individual markets such as the Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese.

Mr Phun said tourism entrepreneurs cannot depend on the STPB for
survival.

"We have to stop being passive and bring in the business ourselves.
If we can bring the cake back to Singapore, then that is the time
we can share it."

The island's humid environment, he added, had also been identified
as a factor linked to the decrease in visitor patronage.

LUFTHANSA QUITTING NEPAL

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Neelam Mathews

KATHMANDU - Nepalese tour operators are blaming the government for
a slowdown in tourism growth following Lufthansa German Airlines'
decision to give notice to quit the kingdom.

Operators said despite Nepal proclaiming its Visit Nepal Year,
landing and parking charges in the first six months have been
increased by 50 per cent and fuel charges by 30 per cent.

With calls being made for a new airport, sources contend there is
nothing on the horizon. They do not expect swift action as the
present airport was built with 70-80 per cent foreign aid.

The travel trade says pollution and lack of planning is leading to
the decline of Nepal's tourism.

Lufthansa, the only European carrier flying directly to Kathmandu,
has explained why it is almost certain to withdraw from Nepal.

Low yields, the end of double digit tourism growth and difficulties
with the location of its international airport, are being cited as
main reasons.

Lufthansa flew more than 25,000 passengers last year into Nepal but
the airline's board is expected to decide for a stop in operations.

Following Lufthansa's directive to German tour operators that the
carrier will not accept bookings to Nepal after April next year, Mr
Kavin Sethi, corporate communications director Asia/Pacific, flew
to the country to inform the trade.

Mr Sethi said: "The board is reviewing the viability of the route
as part of an overall exercise to ensure permanent competitiveness
for the Lufthansa product."

The unique location of Kathmandu airport in a valley, with a 3,000m
runway instead of the conventional 4,000m, is being cited by
Lufthansa as a reason for a cut in profits.

Most aircraft flying into Kathmandu are twin-engined. To ensure
safety in case of engine failure during take-off, either passenger
or fuel load has to be reduced. Except for nearby-based Thai
Airways International, all carriers stop en-route to refuel.

Mr Sethi said: "This has led to additional costs as we require
three sets of crew as against two on a direct haul for the same
distance.

Lufthansa started operations in Nepal nine years ago. Since then,
its presence in the Himalayan kingdom has grown continuously.

To meet the growing travel and export demand in the Nepalese
market, Lufthansa has three weekly flights via Karachi to
Frankfurt.

"We have been the only western carrier to offer direct services to
Kathmandu.

"The others are all east-bound carriers."

NO MORE FLIGHTS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

KATHMANDU - The Royal Nepal Airlines has cancelled its India and
Paris flights for an indefinite period because of a shortage of
aircraft.

For several days, the airline has run press advertisements telling
clients to contact travel agents without spelling out its impending
intentions.

The India sector is the most lucrative route for the carrier. RNA
flies twice daily to New Delhi and once weekly to Mumbai and
Calcutta.

The cancellation follows the expiration of a leased B-727 from
Aviogenex of Serbia. The contract had expired four months ago.

REBELS HURTING IRIAN TREKKING TOURS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Virginia Saunders

JAKARTA - Tour operators offering mountain climbing packages in
Irian Jaya have seen business fall by at least 40 per cent this
year because of military operations against Irian Jaya rebels.

"We are all hurting," said Mr Chaksana Said, marketing manager of
Trekmate Outdoor Adventures.

"The hostage situation in Irian has been going on since January,
and a second abduction came in August right after the first one was
resolved. We have had to cancel all our tour packages and readjust
our plans for the whole year."

Members of the Free Papua Movement in January kidnapped 26 people,
including seven foreigners. In May, a military rescue operation saw
two Indonesian hostages killed before the others were rescued.

On August 14, an armed group seized 16 logging workers near the
south-eastern base of Cartensz peak.

Authorities have closed the glacier-covered Cartensz Pyramid, the
fifth highest peak in the world at 4,884m.

Trekmate, which was selling Irian Jaya to an international
adventure market, was enjoying brisk business before the crisis.

Mr Eka Agus Rachman, managing director, said: "The Cartensz Pyramid
is the main objective of these seasoned professional climbers. We
have tried offering other alternatives, but they won't climb any
other mountain in Indonesia. It is either Cartensz or nothing".

Expeditions to Cartensz start from US$1,900 per person. Trekmate is
looking at running more outward bound programmes and shifting to
soft adventure tours in Baliem Valley at the base of the peak.

Mr Said added that hard adventure programmes in Indonesia had
difficulties with travel insurance.

Trekmate does not know when Cartensz will reopen for trekking tours
and expeditions. Mr Said said it was up to the government.

INDIA: AGENTS SLAM IA FARE HIKE

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Neelam Mathews

NEW DELHI - Tour operators have condemned a 16.3 per cent fare rise
on domestic carrier Indian Airlines (IA) from September 22.

The rise will be in effect on all routes except in the north-
eastern sector, where the hike will be 10 per cent. According to
Indian Airlines, the US dollar fare will be revised with effect
from March 1.

Indian domestic traffic, of which 70 per cent is corporate, is not
likely to decline significantly but tour operators fear the leisure
market  will suffer a 15 per cent fall.

A Delhi-Mumbai one-way business class ticket will now cost US$176
instead of the previous US$151.  Economy goes up to US$118 against
US$101. Delhi to Madras by economy will be US$179 (formerly
US$154), and business class US$267 (US$230). Some fares can go up
by 15 to 30 per cent, depending on the sector.

"Indian tourism seems to be bent on stomping on its own feet," said
Ms Mili Sham, tour manager for Travel Inn.

"We're sending a crystal clear message to the world that we are
unreliable. What happens to my tours that have already been paid
and booked for the months between April to June 1997 based on IA's
present tariff?"

She said that her company now either faced law suits or absorbed
the cost which she claimed.

Mr Rajiv Wahie, Vacations Travels and Tours sales director, said
India was pricing itself out of the market. "IA had a 15 per cent
price hike in January this year...now comes another bombshell."

TOUR AGENTS KILLED IN LAOS

from TRAVEL TRADE GAZETTE ASIA, September 20-26, 1996, 1078

By Tom Racette

BANGKOK - Mr Claude Vincent, director of Vientiane-based Sodetour,
and three staff have been killed in an ambush on a newly-built
portion of highway 13 to Luang Prabang.

Sources in Vientiane said Mr Vincent was transporting a recently-
purchased minivan with six other staff members on September 12 to
the company's new provincial office in the northern city of Luang
Prabang.

In an apparent robbery, unknown assailants riddled the van with
bullets and made off with currency and valuables worth more than
US$9,000, said marketing manager of That Luang Tour, Mr Surith
Sengsavang.

A French resident of Laos for more than 30 years, Mr Vincent was a
tireless promoter of Lao tourism and had travelled extensively
around the country without incident.

Travelling by road from Vientiane to Luang Prabang is not
considered safe. Another assault outside the town of Kasi took
place eight months ago in the same spot where Mr Vincent was
killed, said Novotel Vientiane general manager, Mr Arnauld Kindt.

He expressed surprise that Mr Vincent had taken highway 13 to Luang
Prabang.

He said: "He always told me it's safe to travel anywhere in Laos,
but not there. Not by road."

Mr Kindt was among a number of South-east Asian trade professionals
ready to pay tribute to Mr Vincent, saying he was the first to
promote the country in foreign markets.

He continued: "He was the one to explain and promote the country to
European travel agents after Laos opened to tourism. His door was
always open to people who wanted advice on where to go and what to
see."

Tour operators told TTG Asia that only foreign backpackers on local
transport make the journey.

"Our company never sells programmes with land transfers to the
north. We receive requests from abroad but we always refuse.
Officially, it isn't allowed," said Diethelm Travel Laos managing
director, Ms Vayakone Bodhisane.

According to Mr Surith, the incident highlighted the risk of
overland transfers in a country which is just opening up to
tourism.

"The new road to Luang Prabang is still very dangerous. We can't
guarantee our clients' safety and something like this can still
happen anytime."

Mr Bounty Sayarath, product manager for Sodetour, said operations
would "continue as usual" for the immediate future.

Mr Vincent, 56, is survived by his wife and four children.

The other staff killed in the attack were Lao nationals: Mr Sythong
Bounsavath, guide; Mr Phomma Lamlong, administrator; and Mr
Thongphanh Thippakdee, driver.

Three other staff were understood to have been in the bus at the
time of the attack. One is reported to be seriously wounded while
the other two escaped injury.

Finding quality information covering the events that shape the culture in third world countries can be a difficult task, especially if you rely solely on the American news media.  Dr.  William Close discovered the value, timeliness and breadth of NewsNet's international newswires in finding exactly this type of information.  For many years, Dr.  Close has relied on NewsNet to help keep him informed on the current happenings in Zaire, where he lived and worked for 16 years, as well as several other Central African Countries.<P>

Dr.  Close, who first went to live in Zaire in 1960, has extensive experience with third world countries.  He served as the personal physician to the President of Zaire, the chief doctor for the Congolese army, and as manager of a 2,000-bed hospital.  When the first Ebola epidemic struck in Zaire in 1976, he ran logistics for the team of international scientists who dealt with the epidemic.<P>

Since his return to the U.S.  in 1976, Dr.  Close has maintained regular contact with his associates in Zaire and helps to facilitate medical relief by acting as an unofficial liaison between the Center for Disease Control and the Zairian government.  Dr.  Close, has become a regular NewsNet user in order to stay current with news and events taking place in Zaire and other countries, and finds that the international newswire services provide the best coverage for his needs.<P>

One topic he monitors regularly on NewsNet is the Ebola virus.  Drawing on his experiences living in Africa, Dr.  Close wrote a documentary novel this year titled "Ebola," published by Ballantine/Ivy.  The book deals with events in the tropical rain forests before the arrival of the scientists.  It is the story of people involved in a terrifying intrusion seen through the eyes of a Flemish nun.<P>

Dr.  Close is an avid NewsFlash user, he finds it to be particularly useful while he's traveling.  "With NewsFlash," he said, "I can keep up to date with what's going on all over the world."  Too many people today are misinformed about third world countries, according to Dr.  Close, and keeping up to date with the help of NewsNet and NewsFlash is one way individuals can combat this problem for themselves.  "If you have NewsNet," he related, "you can download tailored information in order to be well informed in the areas relating to your particular interests."<P>

<P>
</P><A NAME="Objective"><IMG SRC="IMG00049.GIF"></P></A>
<P>
Rosenberg's objective is to consistently outperform each client's
designated benchmark and to control risk relative to that benchmark.
We do not earn the extraordinary return, or &quot;alpha,&quot;
by timing the market or by &quot;betting&quot; on factors, such
as size, beta, industry, growth, which contribute too much risk
per unit of return. Our portfolios are fully invested and have
the same exposure to these factors as the benchmark. We add value
at the portfolio level through our stock selection process, and
diversify investment risk across the several hundred holdings
in our portfolios. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="Philosophy"><IMG SRC="IMG00050.GIF"><B><FONT SIZE=4>
</P></FONT></B></A>
<P>
At heart, we are fundamental investors. We believe that stock
prices imperfectly reflect the present value of the expected future
earnings of companies, their &quot;fundamental value&quot;. Since
market prices will converge towards fundamental value over time,
we believe that any investor who can accurately determine fundamental
value, and who applies a disciplined investment process to select
those stocks that are currently misvalued, will outperform the
market over time. </P>
<P>
The premise of our investment philosophy is that there is a link
between the price of a stock and the underlying financial characteristics
of the company. In other words, the price reflects the market's
assessment of how well the company is positioned to generate future
earnings and/or future cash flow. We identify and purchase those
stocks which are slightly misvalued -- they are cheaper than similar
stocks with the same financial characteristics. We are confident
that the market will recognize the &quot;better value&quot; and
move to correct the mispricing by purchasing the stocks in our
portfolio. Common sense suggests that this relationship between
price and fundamentals will persist and our strategy will be successful
into the future. </P>
<P>
Our determination of the &quot;average&quot; valuation for a stock
is based upon a comparison of similar companies. We know that
in any group of similar companies, there are always some that
are overvalued, some that are undervalued, and some that are fairly-valued
relative to the average valuation for the group. These moderate
valuation errors are present in every sector of the market and
can be identified through rigorous quantitative analysis of fundamental
data. </P>
<P>
In determining whether or not a stock is fairly priced, our system
considers each company's current valuation, its future earnings,
and investor sentiment toward the stock. We identify an undervalued
stock, hold it in the portfolio until the market recognizes and
corrects for the misvaluation, then sell the stock at a significant
premium to its purchase price. A simplified example of this would
be purchasing a stock which is 10 percent cheaper than similar
stocks and holding it until the market corrects the relative misvaluation
to within 3 percent. Our portfolios are composed of undervalued
stocks from every sector represented in the client's benchmark,
with a typical portfolio consisting of several hundred stocks.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Decision"><IMG SRC="IMG00051.GIF"></P></A>
<P>
Rosenberg's decision process is a continuum. Our research function
analyzes the 15,000 securities in our global universe, both fundamentally
and technically, and determines the risk characteristics of the
client's benchmark. Our portfolio management function optimizes
portfolio composition, executes trades, and monitors performance
and trading costs. </P>
<P>
Factors crucial to the success of our approach include: (1) accurate
and timely data on a large universe of companies; (2) subtle quantitative
descriptors of value and predictors of changes in value; (3) insightful
definitions of similar businesses. The essence of our approach
is rigorous attention to all aspects of the investment process,
from stock selection to portfolio construction, to trading. We
take great care assimilating, checking and structuring the input
data on which our models rely. We are confident that if the data
are correct, the recommendations made by our system will be sound.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Stock"><B><FONT SIZE=4> <IMG SRC="IMG00052.GIF"></P></FONT></B></A>
<P>
Fundamental valuation of stocks is key to our investment process,
and the heart of our valuation process lies in the Appraisal Model.
Analysis of companies in the United States and Canada is conducted
in a single unified model. The model discriminates where the two
markets are substantially different, while simultaneously comparing
companies in the two markets according to their degrees of similarity.
European companies and Asian companies (other than Japanese) are
analyzed in a nearly global model, which includes the United States
and Canada as a further basis for comparative valuation but which
excludes Japan. Japanese companies are analyzed in an independent
national model. </P>
<P>
An important feature of the appraisal model is the classification
of companies into any of 166 groups of &quot;similar&quot; businesses.
We decompose each company into its individual business segments,
and compare each segment with similar business operations of other
companies operating both within national markets and across markets.
Subject to the availability of data within national markets, we
appraise the company's assets, operating earnings, and sales within
each business segment, accepting the market's valuation of that
category of business as fair. We then integrate the segment appraisals
into three valuation models for the total company: balance sheet,
income statement, and sales and simultaneously adjust the segment
appraisals to include appraisals for variables which are declared
only for the total company, such as taxes, capital structure,
and pension funding. The result is a single valuation for each
of the 15,000 companies we follow. </P>
<P>
The difference between Rosenberg's valuation and the market price
reflects an opportunity for profit. We develop &quot;appraisal
alphas&quot;--the expected rate of extraordinary return--by adjusting
for the rate at which the market has corrected for such misvaluations
in the past. </P>
<P>
A second sphere of analysis is captured by our proprietary Earnings
Change Model, which analyzes more than 20 explanatory variables
to predict individual company earnings over a one year horizon.
The variables are fundamental and fall into three categories:
measures of past profitability, measures of company operations
and consensus earnings forecasts. The earnings change model is
independent of the appraisal model and projects the change in
a company's earnings in cents/current price. The value of the
projected earnings change is converted to an &quot;earnings change
alpha&quot; by multiplying the projected change by the market's
historical response to changes of that magnitude. </P>
<P>
Finally, Rosenberg's Investor Sentiment Model quantifies investor
sentiment about features of stocks which influence price but which
are not captured by the appraisal model or the earnings change
model. We identify high quality companies by looking at past price
patterns and by predicting the probability of deficient earnings.
Our models also capture market enthusiasm towards individual stocks
by looking at broker recommendations and analyst estimates.</P>
<P>
Each company's earnings change alpha and investor sentiment alpha
is added to its appraisal alpha to arrive at a total company alpha.
Stocks with large positive total company alphas are candidates
for purchase. Stocks held in a portfolio with total company alphas
that are only slightly positive, zero or negative in ranking are
candidates for sale. </P>
<P>
Before trading, we systematically analyze the short-term price
behavior of individual stocks to determine the timing of trades.
Our model quantifies investor enthusiasm for each stock by analyzing
its short-term performance relative to similar stocks as well
as changes in analyst and broker opinions about the stock, and
earnings surprises. We develop &quot;trading alphas&quot; - the
expected short-term extraordinary return - which enables us to
purchase stocks from supply and to sell stocks into demand, greatly
reducing trading costs. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="Optim"><IMG SRC="IMG00053.GIF"><B><FONT SIZE=4> </P></FONT></B></A>
<P>
The portfolio optimization system optimizes the trade-off between
risk and reward relative to the client's benchmark. It exploits
the information developed by the stock selection models to maximize
active return, while eliminating unnecessary active risk. Within
each of the following zones, the optimizer recommends positions
in companies which in aggregate constitute the most efficient
portfolio: the United States, Canada, Europe, Pacific Basin, and
Japan. The optimizer simultaneously considers fundamental alphas,
trading alphas, and risk and quantifies the &quot;net benefit&quot;
to the portfolio of each recommended transaction. A stock is considered
for sale when a higher alpha stock with complementary risk characteristics
has been identified. No transaction will be executed unless the
opportunity offered by the purchase candidate sufficiently exceeds
the potential of an existing holding to justify the transaction
costs. In most markets, portfolios are reoptimized continuously
throughout the day, allowing us to respond immediately to investment
opportunities. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="Trading"><IMG SRC="IMG00054.GIF"></P></A>
<P>
Our trading system aggregates the recommended transactions from
the individual portfolios and determines the feasibility of each
recommendation in light of the stock's liquidity, the expected
transaction costs, and general market conditions. It relays target
price information to our trader for each stock considered for
purchase or sale. All transactions are executed within the price
range determined by the trading system. As portfolios are reoptimized
throughout the day, new targets are set which reflect relative
changes in the valuations of our holdings. We continuously monitor
trading costs to determine the impact of commissions and price
disturbance on our portfolios. </P>
<P>
In the U.S., trades are executed through any one of four trading
strategies: traditional brokerage, networks, accommodation, and
package or &quot;basket&quot; trades. The network arrangements
we have developed with Instinet, POSIT, and other institutional
investors facilitate large volume trading with little or no price
disturbance and low commission rates. Accommodative trading (which
we also refer to as our &quot;match system&quot;) allows institutional
buyers and sellers of stock to electronically present us with
their &quot;interest&quot; lists each morning. Any matches between
the inventory which the brokers have presented and our own recommended
trades are signaled to our traders. Since the broker is doing
agency business and has a client on the other side of the trade,
we expect that he will be accommodative in the price. Our objective
in using this match system is to execute most trades on our side
of the bid/ask spread so as to minimize market impact. </P>
<P>
In Europe, the method of trading depends partially on the market
on which we trade. On the European continent, we typically trade
on the exchange, giving orders to brokers for execution either
on an electric exchange (France, Germany, Spain), via open cry
(Switzerland, the Netherlands), or via auction (Italy). We occasionally
deal directly with market makers who effect trades on the ISE
for United Kingdom stocks and on the SEAQ for European securities.</P>
<P>
The high fixed commission schedule in Tokyo combines with the
30 basis point transfer tax on sales to create a costly trading
environment. At the same time, because there are not many market
makers, opportunities exist to improve market impact through careful
timing of trades. </P>
<P>
In general, our approach in Japan relies on limit orders: we prefer
a patient approach to trading, waiting for the other side of the
market to come to our limit. We place limit orders at the opening
auction and selectively place limit orders throughout the day.
In some cases, we use the expertise of the broker to help us with
the timing and structure of these orders. We also use working
orders when trading urgently, especially when investing an initial
cash flow. </P>

<TITLE>why barr rosenberg mutual funds</TITLE>

<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word 2.03z">
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Why Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds?<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=5>We exploit unrealistic forecasts...</FONT></B></I>
<P>
Most investors emphasize a company's earnings growth prospects
when making investment decisions. When formulating their earnings
growth forecasts, these investors focus too much on past earnings
growth and are unrealistic in expecting current trends to persist.
Most investors don't recognize, for example, that more than 90%
of the companies in the top decile of earnings growth do not sustain
that growth in subsequent years. Even among companies with just
above-average earnings growth, 80% fail to sustain that growth!
These examples show how the powerful forces that drive competitive
economies greatly influence the prospects of individual companies.
<P>
At Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds, our process is designed to temper
individual stock analysis with rigorous consideration of the broader
forces at work in competitive economies. Evidence from analyst
earnings forecasts indicates that these competitive forces are
underestimated by most professional analysts, creating errors
and inconsistencies in the way analysts and other investors value
companies. Our systems are designed to systematically search out
and exploit these inconsistencies.<BR>
<P>
<A NAME="OLE_LINK5"><I><B><FONT SIZE=5>We avoid the shortcuts
taken by other...</FONT></B></I></A>
<P>
The human mind cannot process the overwhelming amount of information
that is available on markets, industries and individual companies.
Research in behavioral science shows that when people try to make
important and timely decisions based on overwhelming amounts of
information, they often rely on decision shortcuts. Used incorrectly,
these decision shortcuts can lead to incorrect conclusions. These
decision shortcuts often lead investors to:
<UL>
<LI>Extrapolate recent trends too far into the future.
<LI>Rely too much on the experience of a particular company without
properly considering the experiences of all similar companies.
<LI>Ignore information that contradicts their existing beliefs.
<LI>Infer that simultaneous occurrences necessarily have a cause-and-effect
relationship.
</UL>
<P>
At Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds, our expert systems do not take
these decision shortcuts. Our comprehensive approach to valuing
a company allows us to consider a change in any of the 200 fundamental
factors we evaluate in the complete context of all the other factors.
We will not fall prey to overweighting the one or two factors
that grab traditional investors attention at the moment.
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=5>We build superior models...</FONT></B></I>
<P>
Research in many fields, including financial analysis, documents
an interesting phenomenon regarding expert decision making. If
you can quantify enough of the key variables that an expert looks
at in making a decision and do a good job of describing the analytical
steps the expert takes in forming a judgement, you can build a
model of the expert's decision process that will outperform the
expert. This counter-intuitive finding stems from the fact that
human experts often apply their judgments inconsistently. Even
if the model misses some details, these are more than offset by
the benefits of consistency. Investors often can't employ exactly
the same standards used in judging a stock today that were used
yesterday. The more details an expert has to consider, the more
likely it is that inconsistencies in judgment will arise.
<P>
At Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds, we have put a great deal of effort
into developing innovative and systematic models of a financial
expert's reasoning. By consistently applying these models, our
investment process ensures the discipline necessary to make superior
decisions.

level of Distribution Fee borne by each class. <BR>

Absent such agreement by the Manager to waive its fee and bear such expenses, management fees would be 0.90% for the U.S. Small Cap Series&nbsp;and Total Fund Operating Expenses for the U.S. Small Cap Series&nbsp;would be 1.25% for Institutional Shares, 1.50% for Adviser Shares and 1.75% for Select Shares and management fees would be 1.00% for the Japan Series&nbsp;and Total Fund Operating Expenses for the Japan Series&nbsp;would be 7.26% for Institutional Shares, 7.51% for Adviser Shares and 7.76% for Select Shares. Absent such agreement by the Manager to waive its fee and bear such expenses, management fees would be 1.00% for the International Small Cap Series.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>U.S. Small Capitalization Series<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The investment objective of the U.S. Small Capitalization
Series&nbsp;is to seek total return greater than that of the Russell
2000 Index through investment primarily in equity securities of
smaller companies which are traded principally in the markets
of the United States. Total return is a combination of capital
appreciation and current income (dividend or interest). In the
case of the Fund, total return will be measured by changes in
value of an investment over a given period, assuming that any
dividends or capital gains distributions are reinvested in the
Fund rather than paid to the investor in cash. The Fund does not
seek to <I>maximize</I> total return but, as indicated above,
seeks a total return greater than that of the common stocks referred
to above. Because the companies in which the Fund invests typically
do not distribute significant amounts of company earnings to shareholders,
the Fund's objective will place relatively greater emphasis on
capital appreciation than on current income. The Fund's investment
objective is non&#173;fundamental and thus may be changed by the
Trustees without shareholder approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is currently expected that, under normal circumstances,
most of the Fund's assets will be invested in common stocks of
companies with total market capitalization of less than $750 million
(&quot;small capitalization securities&quot;). This corresponds
with the defining range of market capitalization of companies
in the Russell 2000 Index. Investments in issuers of small capitalization
securities may present greater opportunities for capital appreciation
because of high potential earnings growth, but may also involve
greater risk. See &quot;General Description of Risks and Fund
Investments&nbsp;- Companies with Small Market Capitalizations&quot;
below. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To meet redemptions or pending investments in common
stocks, the Fund may also temporarily hold a portion of its assets
not invested in small capitalization securities in full faith
and credit obligations of the United States government (e.g.,
U.S. Treasury Bills) and in short&#173;term notes, commercial
paper or other money market instruments of high quality (i.e.,
rated at least &quot;A&#173;2&quot; or &quot;AA&quot; by Standard&nbsp;&amp;
Poor's (&quot;S&amp;P&quot;) or Prime 2 or &quot;Aa&quot; by Moody's
Investors Service,&nbsp;Inc. (&quot;Moody's&quot;)) issued by
companies having an outstanding debt issue rated at least &quot;AA&quot;
by S&amp;P or at least &quot;Aa&quot; by Moody's, or determined
by the Manager to be of comparable quality to any of the foregoing.
See also &quot;General Description of Risks and Fund Investments&nbsp;-
Stock Index Futures&quot; below. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Also, the Fund may invest without limit in common
stocks of foreign issuers which are listed on a United States
securities exchange or traded in the United States in the OTC
market. Investments in common stocks of foreign issuers may involve
certain special risks due to foreign economic, political and legal
developments. See &quot;General Description of Risks and Fund
Investments&nbsp;- Special Consideration of Foreign Investments&quot;
below. The Fund will not invest in securities which are principally
traded outside of the United States. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Fundamental Policies.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
The Fund will normally invest most of its assets in small capitalization
securities, and it is a fundamental policy of the Fund, which
may not be changed without shareholder approval, that at least
65% of the Fund's total assets will be invested in small capitalization
securities. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>International Small Capitalization Series<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The investment objective of the International Small
Capitalization Series&nbsp;is to seek total return greater than
the Cazenove Rosenberg Global Smaller Companies Index excluding
the United States (&quot;CRIEXUS&quot;) through investment primarily
in equity securities (i)&nbsp;that are traded principally in securities
markets outside of the United States and (ii)&nbsp;that represent
interests in companies currently with market capitalizations of
between $15 million and $1 billion at the time of purchase by
the Fund. Such companies are referred to herein as &quot;small
capitalization companies.&quot; CRIEXUS is comprised of stocks
of small capitalization companies in mature markets. Total return
is a combination of capital appreciation and current income (dividend
or interest). In the case of the Fund, total return will be measured
by changes in value of an investment over a given period, assuming
that any dividends or capital gains distributions are reinvested
in the Fund rather than paid to the investor in cash. The Fund
does not seek to <I>maximize</I> total return but, as indicated
above, seeks a total return greater than that of the common stocks
referred to above. Because the companies in which the Fund invests
typically do not distribute significant amounts of company earnings
to shareholders, the Fund's objective will place relatively greater
emphasis on capital appreciation than on current income. The Fund's
investment objective is non&#173;fundamental and thus may be changed
by the Trustees without shareholder approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There are no prescribed limits on geographic asset
distribution and the Fund has the authority to invest in securities
traded in securities markets of any country in the world. It is
currently expected that the Fund will invest in approximately
twenty different countries across three regions&nbsp;- Europe,
Pacific and North America (excluding the United States). Under
certain adverse investment conditions, the Fund may restrict the
number of securities markets in which its assets will be invested,
although under normal market circumstances, the Fund's investments
will involve securities principally traded in at least three different
countries. See &quot;General Description of Risks and Fund Investments&nbsp;-
Special Considerations of Foreign Investments&quot; and &quot;General
Description of Risks and Fund Investments&nbsp;- Foreign Exchange
Transactions&quot; below. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under normal circumstances, at least 90% of the Fund's
total assets will be invested in common stocks of small capitalization
companies. It is the non&#173;fundamental policy of the Fund to
invest at least 65% of the Fund's total assets in common stocks
of small capitalization companies. Investments in such companies
may present greater opportunities for capital appreciation because
of high potential earnings growth, but may also involve greater
risk. See &quot;General Description of Risks and Fund Investments&nbsp;-
Companies with Small Market Capitalizations&quot; below. <BR>

United States issuers traded on United States securities markets.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Japan Series<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The investment objective of the Japan Series&nbsp;is
to seek total return greater than that of the Tokyo Stock Price
Index (&quot;TOPIX&quot;) of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. TOPIX is
a capitalization weighted index of all stocks in the First Section
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Total return is a combination of
capital appreciation and current income (dividend or interest).
The Fund will seek to meet this objective primarily through investment
in Japanese equity securities, primarily in common stocks of Japanese
companies. The Fund expects that any income it derives will be
from dividend or interest payments on securities. The Fund's investment
objective is non&#173;fundamental and thus may be changed by the
Trustees without shareholder approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is currently expected that, under normal circumstances,
the Fund will invest at least 90% of its assets in &quot;Japanese
Securities,&quot; that is, securities issued by entities (&quot;Japanese
Companies&quot;) that are organized under the laws of Japan and
that either have 50% or more of their assets in Japan or derive
50% or more of their revenues from Japan. While the Fund will
invest primarily in common stocks of Japanese Companies, it may
also invest in other Japanese Securities, such as convertible
preferred stock, warrants or rights, as well as short&#173;term
government debt securities or other short&#173; term prime obligations
(i.e., high quality debt obligations maturing not more than one
year from the date of issuance). See &quot;General Description
of Risks and Fund Investments&nbsp;- Foreign Exchange Transactions&quot;
below. The Fund will not customarily purchase warrants or rights,
although it may receive warrants or rights through distributions
on other securities it owns. In those cases, the Fund expects
to sell such warrants and rights within a reasonable period of
time following their distribution to the Fund. The Fund does not
currently expect to own warrants or rights with an aggregate value
of greater than 5% of the Fund's assets. Refer to the Statement
of Additional Information for further information with respect
to the Fund's investments in warrants or rights. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Fund currently intends to make its investments
in Japanese equity securities, principally in well&#173;established
Japanese Companies that have an active market for their shares.
Japanese Companies will be considered well&#173;established if
they have been subject for at least two years to the financial
accounting rules&nbsp;for a company whose securities are traded
on a Japanese securities exchange. In the discretion of the Fund's
management, the balance of the Fund's investments may be in companies
that do not meet all such qualifications, although the nature
of the market for the shares will always be an important consideration
in determining whether the Fund will invest in such shares. The
Fund anticipates that most Japanese equity securities in which
it will invest, either directly or indirectly (by means of convertible
debentures), will be listed on securities exchanges in Japan.

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Index Futures.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> The Fund
may also purchase futures contracts or options on futures contracts
on the Tokyo Stock Price Index (&quot;TOPIX&quot;) or the NIKKEI
225 Index (&quot;NIKKEI&quot;) for investment purposes. TOPIX
futures are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade and NIKKEI futures
are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. See &quot;General

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Risks of Investing in Japanese Securities.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
Unlike other mutual funds which invest in the securities of many
countries, the Fund will invest almost exclusively in Japanese
Securities. Generally, the Manager will not vary the percentage
of the Fund's assets which are invested in Japanese Securities
based on its assessment of Japanese economic, political or regulatory
developments or changes in currency exchange rates. However, the
Manager reserves the right to hedge against a possible decline
in the Japanese Securities market by utilizing futures and options
on futures on Japanese stock indices as described above with respect
to 100% of the Fund's total assets. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Because a high percentage of the Fund asset's will
be invested in Japanese Securities, investment in the Fund will
involve the general risks associated with investing in foreign
securities. See &quot;General Description of Risks and Fund Investments&nbsp;-Special
Considerations of Foreign Investments&quot; below. In addition,
investors will be subject to the market risk associated with investing
almost exclusively in stocks of companies which are subject to
Japanese economic factors and conditions. Since the Japanese economy
is dependent to a significant extent on foreign trade, the relationships
between Japan and its trading partners and between the yen and
other currencies are expected to have a significant impact on
particular Japanese companies and on the Japanese economy generally.
The Fund is designed for investors who are willing to accept the
risks associated with changes in such conditions and relationships.

INVESTMENTS<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Investment Risks.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> An investment
in the Funds involves risks similar to those of investing in common
stocks directly. Just as with common stocks, the value of Fund
shares may increase or decrease depending on market, economic,
political, regulatory and other conditions affecting a Fund's
portfolio. These types of risks may be greater with respect to
investments in securities of foreign issuers. Investment in shares
of the Funds is, like investment in common stocks, more volatile
and risky than some other forms of investment. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Companies with Small Market Capitalizations.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
As specified above, the U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;and
the International Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;will invest
a relatively high percentage of their assets in companies with
relatively small market capitalizations (generally, market capitalizations
of under $750 million for the U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;and
under $1 billion for the International Small Capitalization Series).
Companies with small market capitalizations may be dependent upon
a single proprietary product or market niche, may have limited
product lines, markets or financial resources, or may depend on
a limited management group. Typically, such companies have fewer
securities outstanding, which may be less liquid than securities
of larger companies. Their common stock and other securities may
trade less frequently and in limited volume and are generally
more sensitive to purchase and sale transactions. Therefore, the
prices of such securities tend to be more volatile than the prices
of securities of companies with larger market capitalizations.
As a result, the absolute values of changes in the price of securities
of companies with small market capitalizations may be greater
than those of larger, more established companies. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Special Considerations of Foreign Investments.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
Investing in foreign securities (i.e., those which are traded
principally in markets outside of the United States) involves
certain risks not typically found in investing in U.S. domestic
securities. These include risks of adverse change in foreign economic,
political, regulatory and other conditions, and changes in currency
exchange rates, exchange control regulations (including currency
blockage), expropriation of assets or nationalization, imposition
of withholding taxes on dividend or interest payments, and possible
difficulty in obtaining and enforcing judgments against foreign
entities. Furthermore, issuers of foreign securities are subject
to different, and often less comprehensive, accounting, reporting
and disclosure requirements than domestic issuers. In certain
countries, legal remedies available to investors may be more limited
than those available with respect to investments in the United
States or other countries. The laws of some foreign countries
may limit a Fund's ability to invest in securities of certain
issuers located in those countries. The securities of some foreign
issuers and securities traded principally in foreign securities
markets are less liquid and at times more volatile than securities
of comparable U.S. issuers and securities traded principally in
U.S. securities markets. Foreign brokerage commissions and other
fees are also generally higher than those charged in the United
States. There are also special tax considerations which apply
to securities of foreign issuers and securities traded principally
in foreign securities markets. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The risks of investing in foreign securities may
be intensified in the case of investments in emerging markets
or countries with limited or developing capital markets. Prices
of securities of companies in emerging markets can be significantly
more volatile than prices of securities of companies in the more
developed nations of the world, reflecting the greater uncertainties
of investing in less developed markets and economies. In particular,
countries with emerging markets may have relatively unstable governments,
present the risk of nationalization of businesses, restrictions
on foreign ownership, or prohibitions of repatriation of assets,
and may have less protection of property rights than more developed
countries. The economies of countries with emerging markets may
be predominantly based on only a few industries or dependent on
revenues from particular commodities or on international aid or
development assistance, may be highly vulnerable to changes in
local or global trade conditions, and may suffer from extreme
and volatile debt burdens or inflation rates. Local securities
markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable
to respond effectively to increases in trading volume, potentially
making prompt liquidation of substantial holdings difficult or
impossible at times. Consequently, securities of issuers located
in countries with emerging markets may have limited marketability
and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements.
Also, such local markets typically offer less regulatory protections
for investors. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Foreign Exchange Transactions.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
The International Equity Portfolios of the Trust (i.e., the International
Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;and the Japan Series) do not
currently intend to hedge the foreign currency risk associated
with investments in securities denominated in foreign currencies.
However, in order to hedge against possible variations in foreign
exchange rates pending the settlement of securities transactions,
the International Equity Portfolios reserve the right to buy or
sell foreign currencies or to deal in forward foreign currency
contracts; that is, to agree to buy or sell a specified currency
at a specified price and future date. The International Equity
Portfolios also reserve the right to invest in currency futures
contracts and related options thereon for similar purposes. For
example, if the Manager anticipates that the value of the yen
will rise relative to the dollar, a Fund could purchase a currency
futures contract or a call option thereon or sell (write) a put
option to protect against an increase in the price of yen&#173;denominated
securities such Fund intends to purchase. If the Manager anticipates
a fall in the value of the yen relative to the dollar, a Fund
could sell a currency futures contract or a call option thereon
or purchase a put option on such futures contract as a hedge.
If the International Equity Portfolios change their present intention
and decide to utilize hedging strategies, futures contracts and
related options will be used only as a hedge against anticipated
currency rate changes (not for investment purposes) and all options
on currency futures written by a Fund will be covered. These practices,
if utilized, may present risks different from or in addition to
the risks associated with investments in foreign currencies. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Stock Index Futures.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> A
stock index futures contract (an &quot;Index Future&quot;) is
a contract to buy an integral number of units of the relevant
index at a specified future date at a price agreed upon when the
contract is made. A unit is the value at a given time of the relevant
index. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In connection with a Fund's investment in common
stocks, a Fund may invest in Index Futures while the Manager seeks
favorable terms from brokers to effect transactions in common
stocks selected for purchase. A Fund may also invest in Index
Futures when the Manager believes that there are not enough attractive
common stocks available to maintain the standards of diversity
and liquidity set for the Fund pending investment in such stocks
when they do become available. Through the use of Index Futures,
a Fund may maintain a portfolio with diversified risk without
incurring the substantial brokerage costs which may be associated
with investment in multiple issuers. This may permit a Fund to
avoid potential market and liquidity problems (e.g., driving up
or forcing down the price by quickly purchasing or selling shares
of a portfolio security) which may result from increases or decreases
in positions already held by a Fund. Certain provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code may limit this use of Index Futures. A Fund
may also invest in Index Futures in order to hedge its equity
positions. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In contrast to purchases of a common stock, no price
is paid or received by a Fund upon the purchase of a futures contract.
Upon entering into a futures contract, a Fund will be required
to deposit with its custodian in a segregated account in the name
of the futures broker a specified amount of cash or securities.
This is known by participants in the market as &quot;initial margin.&quot;
The type of instruments that may be deposited as initial margin,
and the required amount of initial margin, are determined by the
futures exchange on which the Index Futures are traded. The nature
of initial margin in futures transactions is different from that
of margin in securities transactions in that futures contract
margin does not involve the borrowing of funds by the customer
to finance the transactions. Rather, the initial margin is in
the nature of a performance bond or good faith deposit on the
contract which is returned to the Fund upon termination of the
futures contract, assuming all contractual obligations have been
satisfied. Subsequent payments, called &quot;variation margin,&quot;
to and from the broker, will be made on a daily basis as the price
of the particular Index fluctuates, making the position in the
futures contract more or less valuable, a process known as &quot;marking
to the market.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A Fund may close out a futures contract purchase
by entering into a futures contract sale. This will operate to
terminate the Fund's position in the futures contract. Final determinations
of variation margin are then made, additional cash is required
to be paid by or released to the Fund, and the Fund realizes a
loss or a gain. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A Fund's investment in Index Futures involves risk.
Positions in Index Futures may be closed out by a Fund only on
the futures exchanges on which the Index Futures are then traded.
There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist for
any particular contract at any particular time. The liquidity
of the market in futures contracts could be adversely affected
by &quot;daily price fluctuation limits&quot; established by the
relevant futures exchange which limit the amount of fluctuation
in the price of an Index Futures contract during a single trading
day. Once the daily limit has been reached in the contract, no
trades may be entered into at a price beyond the limit. In such
events, it may not be possible for a Fund to close its futures
contract purchase, and, in the event of adverse price movements,
a Fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments
of variation margin. When the Fund has purchased a futures contract,
its risk is, however, limited to the amount of the contract. The
futures market may also attract more speculators than does the
securities market, because deposit requirements in the futures
market are less onerous than margin requirements in the securities
market. Increased participation by speculators in the futures
market may also cause price distortions. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A Fund will not purchase Index Futures if, as a result,
the Fund's initial margin deposits on transactions that do not
constitute &quot;bona fide hedging&quot; under relevant regulations
of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission would be greater
than 5% of the Fund's total assets. In addition to margin deposits,
when a Fund purchases an Index Future, it is required to maintain,
at all times while an Index Future is held by the Fund, cash,
U.S. Government securities or other high grade liquid debt obligations
in a segregated account with its Custodian, in an amount which,
together with the initial margin deposit on the futures contract,
is equal to the current value of the futures contract. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Illiquid Securities.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> Each
Fund may purchase &quot;illiquid securities,&quot; defined as
securities which cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary
course of business within seven days at approximately the value
at which a Fund has valued such securities, so long as no more
than 15% of the Fund's net assets would be invested in such illiquid
securities after giving effect to the purchase. Investment in
illiquid securities involves the risk that, because of the lack
of consistent market demand for such securities, the Fund may
be forced to sell them at a discount from the last offer price.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Portfolio Turnover.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> Portfolio
turnover is not a limiting factor with respect to investment decisions.
Although the rate of portfolio turnover is very difficult to predict,
it is not anticipated that, under normal circumstances, the annual
portfolio turnover rate for each of the Funds will exceed 100%.
In any particular year, market conditions may well result in greater
portfolio turnover rates than are presently anticipated. The rate
of a Fund's portfolio turnover may vary significantly from time
to time depending on the volatility of economic and market conditions.
High portfolio turnover involves correspondingly greater brokerage
commissions and other transaction costs, which will be borne directly
by a Fund, and could involve realization of capital gains that
would be taxable when distributed to shareholders of such Fund.
To the extent portfolio turnover results in the realization of
net short&#173;term capital gains, such gains ordinarily are taxed
to shareholders at ordinary income tax rates. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Loans of Portfolio Securities.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
Each Fund may lend some or all of its portfolio securities to
broker&#173;dealers. Securities loans are made to broker&#173;dealers
pursuant to agreements requiring that loans be continuously secured
by collateral in cash or U.S. Government securities at least equal
at all times to the market value of the securities lent. The borrower
pays to the lending Fund an amount equal to any dividends or interest
received on the securities lent. When the collateral is cash,
the Fund may invest the cash collateral in interest&#173;bearing,
short&#173;term securities. When the collateral is U.S. Government
securities, the Fund usually receives a fee from the borrower.
Although voting rights or rights to consent with respect to the
loaned securities pass to the borrower, a Fund retains the right
to call the loans at any time on reasonable notice, and it will
do so in order that the securities may be voted by the Fund if
the holders of such securities are asked to vote upon or consent
to matters materially affecting the investment. A Fund may also
call such loans in order to sell the securities involved. The
risks in lending portfolio securities, as with other extensions
of credit, include possible delay in recovery of the securities
or possible loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower
fail financially. However, such loans will be made only to broker&#173;dealers
that are believed by the Manager to be of relatively high credit
standing. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Manager's Discussion of U.S. Small Capitalization
Series&nbsp;Performance<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For the fiscal year ending March&nbsp;31, 1996, the
total return of the U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;was
35.69% after deduction of fees and expenses, more than 6 &#189;
percentage points above the total return of the Russell 2000 Index.
The Manager believes that the U.S. Small Capitalization Series'
total return was the result of an overall rise in the market combined
with the Manager's identification of undervalued U.S. small company
stocks. In the last fiscal year, the prices of the undervalued
U.S. small company stocks selected by the Manager generally rose
towards the Manager's estimates of their fair value. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;has built
a diversified portfolio that closely tracks the risk factor and
industry profile of the Russell 2000 Index while emphasizing companies
that are selling at prices below the Manager's estimates of their
fair value. The total return of the U.S. Small Capitalization
Series&nbsp;has exceeded the total return of the Russell 2000
Index since inception of the Fund as well as in the latest 3&#173;
and 5&#173; year fiscal periods of the Fund. <BR>

<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>During the last fiscal year, the total return of
the Japan Series after deduction of fees and expenses was less
than the total return of its Tokyo Stock Price Index (&quot;TOPIX&quot;)
benchmark; however, the Series has outperformed the TOPIX benchmark
over the latest 3&#173; and 5&#173;year periods. Since inception
in January 1989, the Japan Series has outperformed the TOPIX by
an average of 1.66% per year while matching the risk factor, industry,
and capitalization characteristics of the benchmark. The Japan
Series maintains a diversified portfolio of moderately undervalued
securities identified by the Manager's proprietary stock selection
models. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Under normal circumstances, the Japan Series' investments

</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Manager's General Investment Philosophy and
Strategy<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Manager attempts to add value relative to the
designated benchmark through a quantitative stock selection process,
and seeks to diversify investment risk across the several hundred
holdings in each Fund. In seeking to outperform each Fund's designated
benchmark, the Manager also attempts to control risk in the Fund's
portfolio relative to the securities constituting that benchmark.
So that each Fund is substantially invested in equities at all
times, the Manager does not earn the extraordinary return, or
&quot;alpha,&quot; by timing the market. The Manager seeks to
avoid constructing portfolios that significantly differ from the
relevant benchmark with respect to characteristics such as market
capitalization, historic volatility, or &quot;beta,&quot; and
industry weightings. Each Fund seeks to have a similar exposure
to these factors as the designated benchmark. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Investment Philosophy.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
The Manager's investment strategy is based on the belief that
stock prices imperfectly reflect the present value of the expected
future earnings of companies, their &quot;fundamental value.&quot;
The Manager believes that market prices will converge towards
fundamental value over time, and that therefore, any investor
who can accurately determine fundamental value, and who applies
a disciplined investment process to select those stocks that are
currently undervalued (i.e., the price is less than fundamental
value), will outperform the market over time. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The premise of the Manager's investment philosophy
is that there is a link between the price of a stock and the underlying
financial and operational characteristics of the company. In other
words, the price reflects the market's assessment of how well
the company is positioned to generate future earnings and/or future
cash flow. The Manager identifies and purchases those stocks which
are undervalued (i.e., they are currently cheaper than similar
stocks with the same characteristics). The Manager believes that
the market will recognize the &quot;better value&quot; and that
the mispricing will be corrected as the stocks in the Funds' portfolios
are purchased by other investors. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Determination of the relative valuation of a stock
is based upon a comparison of similar companies. In any group
of similar companies, it is the Manager's view that there are
always some that are overvalued, some that are undervalued, and
some that are fairly&#173;valued relative to the average valuation
for the group. These moderate valuation errors are believed to
be present in every sector of the market and can be identified
through rigorous quantitative analysis of fundamental data. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In determining whether or not a stock is attractive,
the Manager considers the company's current estimated fundamental
value as determined by the Manager's proprietary Appraisal Model,
the company's future earnings, and investor sentiment toward the
stock. The Manager identifies and causes a Fund to purchase an
undervalued stock and to hold it in the relevant Fund's portfolio
until the market recognizes and corrects for the misvaluation.
The Funds' portfolios are composed of undervalued stocks from
every sector represented in the relevant Fund's benchmark, with
a typical portfolio consisting of several hundred stocks. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Decision Process.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> The
Manager's decision process is a continuum. Its research function
develops Models which analyze the 12,000 securities in the global
universe, both fundamentally and technically, and determines the
risk characteristics of the relevant Fund's benchmark. The portfolio
management function optimizes each portfolio's composition, executes
trades, and monitors performance and trading costs. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The essence of the Manager's approach is rigorous
attention to important aspects of the investment process. Factors
crucial to successful stock selection include: (1)&nbsp;accurate
and timely data on a large universe of companies; (2)&nbsp;subtle
quantitative descriptors of value and predictors of changes in
value; and (3)&nbsp;insightful definitions of similar businesses.
The Manager takes great care assimilating, checking and structuring
the input data on which its Models rely. The Manager believes
that if the data is correct, the recommendations made by the system
will be sound. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Stock Selection.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> Fundamental
valuation of stocks is key to the Manager's investment process,
and the heart of the valuation process lies in the Manager's proprietary
Appraisal Model. Analysis of companies in the United States and
Canada is conducted in a single unified Model. The Appraisal Model
discriminates where the two markets are substantially different,
while simultaneously comparing companies in the two markets according
to their degrees of similarity. European companies and Asian companies
(other than Japanese companies) are analyzed in a nearly global
Model, which includes the United States and Canada as a further
basis for comparative valuation, but which excludes Japan. Japanese
companies are analyzed in an independent national Model. The Model
incorporates the various accounting standards which apply in different
markets and makes adjustments to ensure meaningful comparisons.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An important feature of the Appraisal Model is the
classification of companies into one or more of 166 groups of
&quot;similar&quot; businesses. Currently, in the United States,
160 groups are applicable; in Japan, 122 groups are applicable;
and in Europe, 154 groups are applicable. Each company is broken
down into its individual business segments, and each segment is
compared with similar business operations of other companies doing
business in the same geographical market. In most cases, the comparison
is extended to include companies with similar business operations
in different markets. Subject to the availability of data in different
markets, the Manager appraises the company's assets, operating
earnings and sales within each business segment, accepting the
market's valuation of that category of business as fair. The Manager
then integrates the segment appraisals into balance sheet, income
statement, and sales valuation models for the total company, and
simultaneously adjusts the segment appraisals to include appraisals
for variables which are declared only for the total company, such
as taxes, capital structure, and pension funding. The result is
a single valuation for each of the 12,000 companies followed.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The difference between the Manager's appraisal and
the market price is believed to represent an opportunity for profit.
For each stock, the Manager develops &quot;appraisal alphas&quot;
(i.e., the expected rate of extraordinary return) by adjusting
for the rate at which the market has corrected for such misvaluations
in the past. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second sphere of analysis is captured by the Manager's
proprietary Earnings Change Model, which analyzes more than 20
variables to predict individual company earnings over a one year
horizon. The variables are fundamental and fall into three categories:
measures of past profitability, measures of company operations
and consensus earnings forecasts. The Earnings Change Model is
independent of the Appraisal Model and projects the change in
a company's earnings in cents/current price. The value of the
projected earnings change is converted to an &quot;earnings change
alpha&quot; by multiplying the projected change by the market's
historical response to changes of that magnitude. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Finally, the Manager's proprietary Investor Sentiment
Model quantifies investor sentiment about features of stocks which
influence price but which are not captured by the Appraisal Model
or the Earnings Change Model. This Model measures company quality
by looking at past price patterns and by predicting the probability
of deficient earnings. The Investor Sentiment Model also captures
market enthusiasm towards individual stocks by looking at broker
recommendations and analyst estimates. Investor sentiment alphas
are developed by multiplying the Model's sentiment scores by the
market's historical response to such scores. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each company's earnings change alpha and investor
sentiment alpha is added to its appraisal alpha to arrive at a
total company alpha. Stocks with large positive total company
alphas are candidates for purchase. Stocks held in a portfolio
with total company alphas that are only slightly positive, zero
or negative are candidates for sale. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Before trading, the Manager systematically analyzes
the short&#173;term price behavior of individual stocks to determine
the timing of trades. The Investor Sentiment Model quantifies
investor enthusiasm for each stock by analyzing its short&#173;term
performance relative to similar stocks, changes in analyst and
broker opinions about the stock, and earnings surprises. The Manager
develops a &quot;trading alpha&quot; for each stock (i.e., the
expected short&#173;term extraordinary return) which is designed
to enable the Funds to purchase stocks from supply and to sell
stocks into demand, greatly reducing trading costs. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Optimization.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> The Manager's
portfolio optimization system seeks to optimize the trade&#173;off
between risk and reward relative to each Fund's benchmark. It
exploits the information developed by the Manager's stock selection
Models to maximize return relative to the benchmark, while avoiding
a portfolio with exposure to any other extraneous factors that
would distinguish the Fund's portfolio from the stocks constituting
the relevant benchmark. Within the geographic zone appropriate
for each Fund, the optimizer recommends positions in companies
which in aggregate constitute the most efficient portfolio. The
optimizer simultaneously considers total company alphas, trading
alphas, and risk and quantifies the expected &quot;net benefit&quot;
to the portfolio of each recommended transaction. A stock is considered
for sale when a higher alpha stock with complementary risk characteristics
has been identified. No transaction will be executed unless the
opportunity offered by the purchase candidate sufficiently exceeds
the potential of an existing holding to justify the transaction
costs. In most markets, portfolios are reoptimized continuously
throughout the day, allowing the Manager to respond immediately
to investment opportunities, subject to certain limitations on
short&#173;term trading applicable by virtue of each Fund's intention
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal
Revenue Code. <BR>

<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Trading.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> The Manager's
trading system aggregates the recommended transactions for each
of the Funds and determines the feasibility of each recommendation
in light of the stock's liquidity, the expected transaction costs,
and general market conditions. It relays target price information
to a trader for each stock considered for purchase or sale. Trades
are executed through any one of four trading strategies: traditional
brokerage, networks, accommodation, and package or &quot;basket&quot;
trades. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The network arrangements the Manager has developed
with Instinet Matching System (IMS), Portfolio System for Institutional
Trading (POSIT), and the Arizona Stock Exchange (AZX) facilitate
large volume trading with little or no price disturbance and low
commission rates. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Accommodative trading (which we also refer to as
the Manager's &quot;match system&quot;) allows institutional buyers
and sellers of stock to electronically present the Manager with
their &quot;interest&quot; lists each morning. Any matches between
the inventory which the brokers have presented and the Manager's
own recommended trades are signaled to the Manager's traders.
Since the broker is doing agency business and has a client on
the other side of the trade, the Manager expects that the other
side will be accommodative in the price. The Manager's objective
in using this match system is to execute most trades on the Manager's
side of the bid/ask spread so as to minimize market impact. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Package trades further allow the Manager to trade
large lists of orders simultaneously using state of the art tools
such as the Instinet Real&#173;Time System, Instinet Order Matching
System and Lattice Trading System. Those tools provide order entry,
negotiation and execution capabilities, either directly to other
institutions or electronically to the floor of the exchange. The
advantages of using such systems include speed of execution, low
commissions, anonymity and very low market impact. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Manager continuously monitors trading costs to
determine the impact of commissions and price disturbance on the
Funds' portfolios. <BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under separate Management Contracts with the Trust
on behalf of each Fund, the Manager selects and reviews each Fund's
investments and provides executive and other personnel for the
management of the Trust. Pursuant to the Trust's Agreement and
Declaration of Trust, the Board of Trustees supervises the affairs
of the Trust as conducted by the Manager. In the event that the
Manager ceases to be the manager of a Fund, the right of the Trust

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The organizational expenses of the U.S. Small Capitalization
Series&nbsp;and the Japan Series were borne by the Manager and
such expenses of the International Small Capitalization Series
will be borne by the Manager. Each Fund will pay all other expenses
incurred in the operation of such Fund, including, but not limited
to, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes in connection with
the Fund's portfolio transactions, all applicable taxes and filing
fees, distribution fees, shareholder servicing fees, the fees
and expenses for registration or qualification of its shares under
the federal or state securities laws, the compensation of trustees
who are not partners, officers or employees of the Manager, interest
charges, expenses of issue or redemption of shares, charges of
custodians, auditing and legal expenses, expenses of determining

Funds Distributor,&nbsp;Inc. (the &quot;Distributor&quot;), a

the Distributor will become a wholly&#173;owned subsidiary of

<FONT SIZE=2>Solely for the purpose of compensating the Distributor
for services and expenses primarily intended to result in the
sale of Select Shares of the Funds, such shares are subject to
an annual Distribution Fee of up to 0.50% of the average daily
net assets attributable to such shares in accordance with a Distribution
Plan (the &quot;Distribution Plan&quot;) adopted by the Trust
pursuant to Rule 12b&#173;1 under the 1940 Act. Currently, each
Fund pays the Distributor an annual Distribution Fee of 0.25%
of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Select
Shares. Activities for which the Distributor may be reimbursed
include (but are not limited to) the development and implementation
of direct mail promotions and advertising for the Funds, the preparation,
printing and distribution of prospectuses for the Funds to recipients
other than existing shareholders, and contracting with one or
more wholesalers of the Funds' shares. The Distribution Plan for
Select Shares went into effect on August&nbsp;5, 1996. The Distribution
Plan is of the type known as a &quot;compensation&quot; plan.
This means that, although the trustees of the Trust are expected
to take into account the expenses of the Distributor in their

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The offering price for shares of each Fund is the
net asset value per share next determined after receipt of a purchase
order plus the applicable Fund Reimbursement Fee. See &quot;Net
Asset Value.&quot; The payment of a Fund Reimbursement Fee by
each cash investor, which is used to defray the significant costs
associated with investing the proceeds of the sale of the shares
to such investors, is designed to eliminate the diluting effect
such costs would otherwise have on the net asset value of shares
held by pre&#173;existing shareholders. The amount of the Fund
Reimbursement Fee represents the Manager's estimate of the costs
reasonably anticipated to be associated with the purchase of portfolio
securities by the Funds and is paid to and retained by the Funds
and used by the Funds to defray such costs. No portion of the
Fund Reimbursement Fee is paid to or retained by the Distributor
or the Manager. The Fund Reimbursement Fee for each Fund, expressed
as a percentage of the net asset value of the shares of each Fund,
is as follows: U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;- 0.25%;
International Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;- 0.50%; Japan
Series&nbsp;- 0.50%. Reinvestments of dividends and capital gains
distributions paid by the Funds, in&#173;kind investments, investments
made through the Barr Rosenberg Automatic Investment Program and
additional investments of 401(k) participants are not subject
to a Fund Reimbursement Fee. Also, investors may be charged an
additional fee if they effect transactions through their particular
broker or agent. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As described below, the net asset value of the Japan
Series shares is determined as of 3:00 p.m., Tokyo time. See &quot;Net
Asset Value.&quot; Due to the 14 hour difference between Tokyo
time and New York time, investors who call in purchase orders
after 1:00&nbsp;a.m. New York time (with adjustment for daylight
savings time) will get the price of Japan Series&nbsp;shares as
determined on the next business day in Tokyo. In such circumstances,
investors should expect to receive the price published on the

<FONT SIZE=2>The Fund(s) to be purchased should be specified on
the Account Application. Purchases are accepted subject to collection
of checks at full value and conversion into federal funds. In
all cases, subject to acceptance by the Trust, payment for the
purchase of shares received by mail will be credited to a shareholder's
account at the net asset value per share of the Fund next determined
after receipt with deduction of any Fund Reimbursement Fee, even
though the check may not yet have been converted into federal

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Additional Cash Investments<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Additional cash investments may be made at any time
by mailing a check to the Trust at the address noted under &quot;Initial
Cash Investments by Mail&quot; (payable to Barr Rosenberg Series&nbsp;Trust)
or by wiring monies to Investors Fiduciary Trust Company as outlined
above. Notification must be given at 1&#173;800&#173;447&#173;3332
prior to 4:15&nbsp;p.m., New York time, of the wire date. The
minimum amounts for additional cash investments are $10,000 for
Institutional Shares, $1,000 for Adviser Shares and $500 for Select
Shares. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Investments In&#173;Kind (Institutional Shares)
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Institutional Shares may be purchased in exchange
for common stocks on deposit at The Depository Trust Company (&quot;DTC&quot;)
or by a combination of such common stocks and cash. Purchase of
Institutional Shares of a Fund in exchange for stocks is subject
in each case to the determination by the Manager that the stocks
to be exchanged are acceptable. Securities accepted by the Manager
in exchange for Fund shares will be valued as set forth under
&quot;Determination of Net Asset Value&quot; (generally the last
quoted sale price) as of the time of the next determination of
net asset value after such acceptance. All dividends, subscription
or other rights which are reflected in the market price of accepted
securities at the time of valuation become the property of the
Fund and must be delivered to the Fund upon receipt by the investor
from the issuer. A gain or loss for federal income tax purposes
would be realized by investors subject to federal income taxation
upon the exchange, depending upon the investor's basis in the
securities tendered. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Manager will not approve the acceptance of securities
in exchange for Fund shares unless (1)&nbsp;the Manager, in its
sole discretion, believes the securities are appropriate investments
for the Fund; (2)&nbsp;the investor represents and agrees that
all securities offered to the Fund are not subject to any restrictions
upon their sale by the Fund under the Securities Act of 1933,
or otherwise; and (3)&nbsp;the securities may be acquired under
the Fund's investment restrictions. In addition, portfolio securities
acquired in exchange for Fund shares will (1)&nbsp;be acquired
for investment and not for resale; (2)&nbsp;be liquid securities;
and (3)&nbsp;have a readily ascertainable value. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Other Purchase Information<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An eligible shareholder may also participate in the
Barr Rosenberg Automatic Investment Program, an investment plan
that automatically debits money from the shareholder's bank account
and invests it in Select Shares of one or more of the Funds through
the use of electronic funds transfers. Investors may commence
their participation in this program with a minimum initial investment
of $10,000 and may elect to make subsequent investments by transfers
of a minimum of $50 into their established Fund account. You may
contact the Trust for more information about the Barr Rosenberg
Automatic Investment Program. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For purposes of calculating the purchase price of
Fund shares, a purchase order is received by the Trust on the
day that it is in &quot;good order&quot; unless it is rejected
by the Distributor. For a purchase order to be in &quot;good order&quot;
on a particular day a check or money wire must be received on
or before 4:15&nbsp;p.m. New York time (in the case of Adviser
Shares or Select Shares) of that day or, in the case of Institutional
Shares, the investor's securities must be placed on deposit at
DTC prior to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. New York time or, in the case of
cash investments, the Trust must have received adequate assurances
that federal funds will be wired to the Fund prior to 4:15&nbsp;p.m.
New York time, on the following business day. If the consideration
is received by the Trust after the deadline, the purchase price
of Fund shares will be based upon the next determination of net
asset value of Fund shares. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Trust reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
to suspend the offering of shares of its Funds or to reject purchase
orders when, in the judgment of the Manager, such suspension or
rejection would be in the best interests of the Trust. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Purchases of a Fund's shares may be made in full
or in fractional shares of the Fund calculated to three decimal
places. In the interest of economy and convenience, certificates

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Shares of all Funds may be used as a funding medium
for IRAs and other qualified retirement plans (&quot;Plans&quot;).
The minimum initial investment for an IRA or a Plan is $10,000.
An IRA may be established through a custodial account with Investors
Fiduciary Trust Company. A special application must be completed
in order to create such an account. A $5.00 establishment fee
and an annual $12.00 maintenance and custody fee is payable with
respect to each IRA. In addition, a $10.00 termination fee will
be charged when the account is closed. Shares may also be purchased
for IRAs and Plans established with other authorized custodians.
Contributions to IRAs are subject to prevailing amount limits
set by the Internal Revenue Service. For more information about
IRAs and other Plan accounts, call the Trust at 1&#173;800&#173;447&#173;3332.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>REDEMPTION OF SHARES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Shares of each Fund may be redeemed by mail, or,
if authorized, by telephone. A Fund Reimbursement Fee is charged
at the time of redemption on all redemptions except in&#173;kind
redemptions of Institutional Shares and redemptions made under
the Systematic Withdrawal Plan. The Fund Reimbursement Fee paid
on such redemptions is used to defray the significant costs to
existing shareholders associated with the sale of Fund portfolio
securities to satisfy the redemption requests and to eliminate
the diluting effect such costs would otherwise have on the net
asset value of shares held by existing shareholders. The amount
of the Fund Reimbursement Fee represents the Manager's estimate
of the costs reasonably anticipated to be associated with redemptions
and is retained by the Funds to defray such costs. No portion
of the Fund Reimbursement Fee is paid to or retained by the Distributor
or the Manager. The Fund Reimbursement Fee for each Fund, expressed
as a percentage of the net asset value of the shares redeemed
of such Fund, is as follows: U.S. Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;-
0.25%; International Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;- 0.50%;
Japan Series&nbsp;- 0.50%. The value of shares redeemed may be
more or less than the purchase price, depending on the market
value of the investment securities held by the particular Fund.

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Trust will redeem its shares at the net asset
value next determined after the request is received in &quot;good
order&quot; and will deduct from the proceeds the applicable Fund
Reimbursement Fee. The net asset values per share of the Funds
are determined as of 4:15&nbsp;p.m., New York time, on each day
that the New York Stock Exchange,&nbsp;Inc., the Trust and the
Distributor are open for business. Requests should be addressed
to Barr Rosenberg Series&nbsp;Trust, 237 Park Avenue, New York,
New York 10017. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Requests in &quot;good order&quot; must include the
following documentation: <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>(a) a letter of instruction, if required, or a stock
assignment specifying the number of shares or dollar amount to
be redeemed, signed by all registered owners of the shares in

</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Signature Guarantees<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To protect shareholder accounts, the Trust and its
transfer agent from fraud, signature guarantees are required to
enable the Trust to verify the identity of the person who has
authorized a redemption from an account. Signature guarantees
are required for (1)&nbsp;redemptions where the proceeds are to
be sent to someone other than the registered shareholder(s) at
the registered address, (2)&nbsp;redemptions of $25,000 or more,
and (3)&nbsp;share transfer requests. Signature guarantees may
be obtained from certain eligible financial institutions, including
but not limited to, the following: banks, trust companies, credit
unions, securities brokers and dealers, savings and loan associations
and participants in the Securities and Transfer Association Medallion
Program (&quot;STAMP&quot;), the Stock Exchange Medallion Program
(&quot;SEMP&quot;) or the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature
Program (&quot;MSP&quot;). Shareholders may contact the Trust
at 1&#173;800&#173;447&#173;3332 for further details. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>By Telephone<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Provided the Telephone Redemption Option has been
authorized by an investor in an account application, a redemption
of shares may be requested by calling the Transfer Agent at 1&#173;800&#173;447&#173;3332
and requesting that the redemption proceeds be mailed to the primary
registration address or wired per the authorized instructions.
If the Telephone Redemption Option or the Telephone Exchange Option
(as described below) is authorized, the Transfer Agent may act
on telephone instruction from any person representing himself
or herself to be a shareholder and believed by the Transfer Agent
to be genuine. The Transfer Agent's records of such instructions
are binding and the shareholder, and not the Trust or the Transfer
Agent, bears the risk of loss in the event of unauthorized instructions
reasonably believed by the Transfer Agent to be genuine. The Transfer
Agent will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions
communicated are genuine and, if it does not, it may be liable
for any losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent instructions.
The procedures employed in connection with transactions initiated
by telephone include tape recording of telephone instructions
and requiring some form of personal identification prior to acting
upon instructions received by telephone. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Systematic Withdrawal Plan<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An owner of $12,000 or more of shares of a Fund may
elect to have periodic redemptions made from the investor's account
to be paid on a monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual basis.
The maximum payment per year is 12% of the account value at the
time of the election. The shareholder will normally redeem a sufficient
number of shares to make the scheduled redemption payments on
a date selected by the shareholder. Depending on the size of the
payment requested and fluctuation in the net asset value, if any,
of the shares redeemed, redemptions for the purpose of making
such payments may reduce or even exhaust the account. A shareholder
may request that these payments be sent to a predesignated bank
or other designated party. Capital gains and dividend distributions
paid to the account will automatically be reinvested at net asset
value on the distribution payment date. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Further Redemption Information<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Redemption proceeds for shares of the Trust recently
purchased by check may not be distributed until payment for the
purchase has been collected, which may take up to fifteen business
days from the purchase date. Shareholders can avoid this delay
by utilizing the wire purchase option. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If the Manager determines, in its sole discretion,
that it would not be in the best interests of the remaining shareholders
of a Fund to make redemption payment wholly or partly in cash,
the Fund may pay the redemption price of Institutional Shares
in whole or in part by a distribution in kind of readily marketable
securities held by the relevant Fund in lieu of cash. There will
be no Fund Reimbursement Fee on redemptions in kind of Institutional
Shares. Securities used to redeem Fund shares in kind will be
valued in accordance with the Fund's procedures for valuation
described under &quot;Determination of Net Asset Value.&quot;
Securities distributed by the Fund in kind will be selected by
the Manager in light of the Fund's objective and will not generally
represent a <I>pro rata</I> distribution of each security held
in the Fund's portfolio. Investors may incur brokerage charges
on the sale of any such securities so received in payment of redemptions.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Trust may suspend the right of redemption and
may postpone payment for more than seven days when the New York
Stock Exchange is closed for other than weekends or holidays,
or if permitted by the rules&nbsp;of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, during periods when trading on the Exchange is restricted
or during an emergency which makes it impracticable for the Funds
to dispose of their securities or to fairly determine the value
of their net assets, or during any other period permitted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the protection of investors.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>EXCHANGE OF FUND SHARES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Funds offer two convenient ways to exchange shares
in one Fund for shares of another Fund in the Trust. Shares of
a particular class of a Fund may be exchanged only for shares
of the same class in another Fund. There is no sales charge on
exchanges, but both the Fund from which the exchange is made and
the Fund into which the exchange is made will charge any applicable
Fund Reimbursement Fee. Before engaging in an exchange transaction,
a shareholder should read carefully the information in the Prospectus
describing the Fund into which the exchange will occur. A shareholder
may not exchange shares of a class of one Fund for shares of the
same class of another Fund that is not qualified for sale in the
state of the shareholder's residence. Although the Trust has no
current intention of terminating or modifying the exchange privilege,
it reserves the right to do so at any time. Except as otherwise
permitted by regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Trust will give 60 days' advance notice to shareholders of
any termination or material modification of the exchange privilege.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An exchange is taxable as a sale of a security on
which a gain or loss may be recognized. Shareholders should receive
written confirmation of the exchange within a few days of the
completion of the transaction. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A new account opened by exchange must be established
with the same name(s), address and social security number as the
existing account. All exchanges will be made based on the respective
net asset values next determined following receipt of the request
by the Funds containing the information indicated below. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Exchange by Mail<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To exchange Fund shares by mail, shareholders should
simply send a letter of instruction to the Trust. The letter of
instruction must include: (a)&nbsp;the investor's account number;
(b)&nbsp;the class of shares to be exchanged; (c)&nbsp;the Fund
from and the Fund into which the exchange is to be made; (d)&nbsp;the
dollar or share amount to be exchanged; and (e)&nbsp;the signatures
of all registered owners or authorized parties. All signatures
must be guaranteed by an eligible guarantor institution including
members of national securities exchanges, commercial banks or
trust companies, broker&#173;dealers, credit unions and savings
associations. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Exchange by Telephone<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To exchange Fund shares by telephone or to ask questions
about the exchange privilege, shareholders may call the Trust
at 1&#173;800&#173;447&#173;3332. If you wish to exchange shares,
please be prepared to give the telephone representative the following
information: (a) the account number, social security number and
account registration; (b)&nbsp;the class of shares to be exchanged;
(c)&nbsp;the name of the Fund from which and the Fund into which
the exchange is to be made; and (d)&nbsp;the dollar or share amount
to be exchanged. Telephone exchanges are available only if the
shareholder so indicates by checking the &quot;yes&quot; box on
the Account Application. The Trust employs procedures, including
recording telephone calls, testing a caller's identity, and sending
written confirmation of telephone transactions, designed to give
reasonable assurance that instructions communicated by telephone
are genuine, and to discourage fraud. To the extent that a Fund
does not follow such procedures, it may be liable for losses due
to unauthorized or fraudulent telephone instructions. A Fund will
not be liable for acting upon instructions communicated by telephone
that it reasonably believes to be genuine. The Trust reserves
the right to suspend or terminate the privilege of exchanging
by mail or by telephone at any time. <BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With the exception of the Japan Series, the net asset
value of each class of shares of each Fund will be determined
once on each day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open
as of 4:15&nbsp;p.m., New York time. In the case of the Japan
Series, the net asset value of each class of shares of that Fund
will be determined once on each day on which the Tokyo Stock Exchange
is open as of 3:00&nbsp;p.m., Tokyo time. Due to the 14 hour time
difference, 3:00&nbsp;p.m. Tokyo time corresponds to 1:00&nbsp;a.m.
New York time (with adjustments for daylight savings time). Accordingly,
purchase orders received for the Japan Series&nbsp;after 1:00
a.m., New York time (with adjustments for daylight savings time)
will receive the offering price determined on the next business
day in Japan. See &quot;Purchase of Shares&quot; above. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The net asset value per share of each class of a
Fund is determined by dividing the particular class's proportionate
interest in the total market value of the Fund's portfolio investments
and other assets, less any applicable liabilities, by the total
outstanding shares of that class of the Fund. Specifically, each
Fund's liabilities are allocated among its classes. The total
of such liabilities allocated to a particular class plus that
class's shareholder servicing and/or distribution expenses, if
any, and any other expenses specially allocated to that class
are then deducted from the class's proportionate interest in the
Fund's assets. The resulting amount for each class is divided
by the number of shares of that class outstanding to produce the
&quot;net asset value&quot; per share. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Portfolio securities listed on a securities exchange
for which market quotations are available are valued at the last
quoted sale price on each business day, or, if there is no such
reported sale, at the most recent quoted bid price. Price information
on listed securities is generally taken from the closing price
on the exchange where the security is primarily traded. Unlisted
securities for which market quotations are readily available are
valued at the most recent quoted bid price, except that debt obligations
with sixty days or less remaining until maturity may be valued
at their amortized cost. Exchange&#173;traded options, futures
and options on futures are valued at the settlement price as determined
by the appropriate clearing corporation. Other assets and securities
for which no quotations are readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith by the trustees of the Trust
or by persons acting at their direction. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>DISTRIBUTIONS<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each Fund intends to pay out as dividends substantially
all of its net investment income (which comes from dividends and
any interest it receives from its investments and net realized
short&#173;term capital gains). Each Fund also intends to distribute
substantially all of its net realized long&#173;term capital gains,
if any, after giving effect to any available capital loss carryover.
Each Fund's policy is to declare and pay distributions of its
dividends and interest annually although it may do so more frequently
as determined by the Trustees of the Trust. The Funds' policy
is to distribute net realized short&#173;term capital gains and
net realized long&#173;term gains annually, although it may do
so more frequently as determined by the Trustees of the Trust
to the extent permitted by applicable regulations. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>All dividends and/or distributions will be paid out
in the form of additional shares of the Fund to which the dividends
and/or distributions relate at net asset value unless the shareholder
elects to receive cash. Shareholders may make this election by
marking the appropriate box on the Account Application or by writing
to the Administrator. There is no Fund Reimbursement Fee charged
on reinvested dividends or distributions. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>TAXES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each Fund intends to qualify each year as a regulated
investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. So long as a Fund distributes substantially
all of its dividend, interest and certain other income, its net
realized short&#173;term capital gains and its net realized long&#173;term
capital gains to its shareholders and otherwise qualifies for
the special rules&nbsp;governing the taxation of regulated investment
companies, the Fund itself will not pay federal income tax on
the amount distributed. Dividend distributions (<I>i.e.</I>, distributions
derived from interest, dividends and certain other income, including,
in general, short&#173;term capital gains) will be taxable to
shareholders subject to income tax as ordinary income. Distributions
of any long&#173;term capital gains are taxable as such to shareholders
subject to income tax, regardless of how long a shareholder may
have owned shares in such Fund. A distribution paid to shareholders
by a Fund in January&nbsp;of a year is generally deemed to have
been received by shareholders on December&nbsp;31 of the preceding
year, if the distribution was declared and payable to shareholders
of record on a date in October, November&nbsp;or December&nbsp;of
that preceding year. Each Fund will provide federal tax information
annually, including information about dividends and distributions
paid during the preceding year. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If more than 50% of a Fund's assets at fiscal year&#173;end
is represented by debt and equity securities of foreign corporations,
the Fund may (and the Japan Series and the International Small
Capitalization Series intend to) elect to permit shareholders
who are U.S. citizens or U.S. corporations to claim a foreign
tax credit or deduction (but not both) on their U.S. income tax
returns for their <I>pro rata</I> portion of qualified taxes paid
by the Fund to foreign countries. As a result, the amounts of
foreign income taxes paid by such Fund would be treated as additional
income to shareholders of such Fund for purposes of the foreign
tax credit. Each such shareholder would include in gross income
from foreign sources its <I>pro rata</I> share of such taxes.
Certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code may prevent
shareholders from receiving a full foreign tax credit or deduction
for their allocable amount of such taxes. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The foregoing is a general summary of the federal
income tax consequences of investing in a Fund to shareholders
who are U.S. citizens or U.S. corporations. Shareholders should
consult their own tax advisers about the tax consequences of an
investment in the Funds in light of each shareholder's particular
tax situation. Shareholders should also consult their own tax
advisers about consequences under foreign, state, local or other
applicable tax laws. </FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST AND OWNERSHIP
OF SHARES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Trust is a diversified open&#173;end series investment
company organized as a Massachusetts business trust under the
laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts by an Agreement and
Declaration of Trust (the &quot;Declaration of Trust&quot;) dated
April&nbsp;1, 1988, as amended from time to time. The U.S. Small
Capitalization Series&nbsp;commenced operations on or about September&nbsp;13,
1988. The Japan Series&nbsp;commenced operations on or about January&nbsp;3,
1989. The International Small Capitalization Series&nbsp;expects
to commence operations on or about the date of this Prospectus.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to
issue an unlimited number of full and fractional shares of beneficial
interest which are presently divided into three series. Interests
in each of the Funds described in this Prospectus are represented
by shares of such Fund. The Declaration of Trust also permits
the Trustees, without shareholder approval, to subdivide any series
of shares into various sub&#173;series of shares with such dividend
preferences and other rights as the Trustees may designate. While
the Trustees have no current intention to exercise this power,
it is intended to allow them to provide for an equitable allocation
of the impact of any future regulatory requirements which might
affect various classes of shareholders differently. The Trustees
may also, without shareholder approval, establish one or more
additional separate portfolios for investments in the Trust or
merge two or more existing portfolios. Shareholders' investments
in such a portfolio would be evidenced by a separate series of
shares. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each Fund is further divided into three classes of
shares designated as Institutional Shares, Adviser Shares and
Select Shares. Each class of shares of each Fund represents interests
in the assets of that Fund and has identical dividend, liquidation
and other rights and the same terms and conditions except that
expenses, if any, related to the distribution and shareholder
servicing of a particular class are borne solely by such class
and each class may, at the Trustees' discretion, also pay a different
share of other expenses, not including advisory or custodial fees
or other expenses related to the management of the Trust's assets,
if these expenses are actually incurred in a different amount
by that class, or if the class receives services of a different
kind or to a different degree than the other classes. All other
expenses are allocated to each class on the basis of the net asset
value of that class in relation to the net asset value of the
particular Fund. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each class of shares of each Fund has identical voting
rights except that each class has exclusive voting rights on any
matter submitted to shareholders that relates solely to that class,
and has separate voting rights on any matter submitted to shareholders
in which the interests of one class differ from the interests
of any other class. Each class of shares has exclusive voting
rights with respect to matters pertaining to any distribution
or servicing plan applicable to that class. Matters submitted
to shareholder vote must be approved by each Fund separately except
(i)&nbsp;when required by the Investment Company Act of 1940,
all shares shall be voted together and (ii)&nbsp;when the Trustees
have determined that the matter does not affect all Funds, then
only shareholders of the Fund or Funds affected shall be entitled
to vote on the matter. All three classes of shares of a Fund will
vote together, except with respect to any distribution or servicing
plan applicable to a class or when a class vote is required as
specified above or otherwise by the Investment Company Act of
1940. Shares are freely transferable, are entitled to dividends
as declared by the Trustees and, in liquidation of a Fund portfolio,
are entitled to receive the net assets of that portfolio, but
not of the other Funds. The Trust does not generally hold annual
meetings of shareholders and will do so only when required by
law. Shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares
may remove trustees from office by votes cast in person or by
proxy at a meeting of shareholders or by written consent. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Declaration of Trust provides for the perpetual
existence of the Trust. The Trust, may, however, be terminated
at any time by vote of at least two&#173;thirds of the outstanding
shares of the Trust. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Shareholders could, under certain circumstances,
be held personally liable for the obligations of the Trust. However,
the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account
of that liability is considered remote since it may arise only
in very limited circumstances. </FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>SHAREHOLDER INQUIRIES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Orinda, CA, October 1, 1996: Rosenberg Institutional Equity
Management has announced that it has expanded shareholder eligibility for
its U. S. Small Capitalization Fund and its Japan Fund to include retail
investors. Rosenberg has advised these funds since their inception in 1989,
but, to date, they have only been available to the institutional clients
of the Rosenberg group of companies. Rosenberg has also announced that
it will act as advisor to a newly formed International Small Capitalization
Fund, which is available to both retail and institutional clients. Furman
Selz LLC, New York, has been named administrator and distributor for the
funds. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The performance objective of each of the three funds is
to achieve a total return (capital appreciation and current income) greater
than that of its respective benchmark: the Russell 2000 Index for the U.S.
Small Capitalization Fund, the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) for the
Japan Fund and the Cazenove Rosenberg Global Smaller Companies Index excluding
U.S. companies (CRIEXUS) for the International Small Capitalization Fund.
The U.S. Small Capitalization Fund invests primarily in equity securities
of small companies based in the U.S., with total market capitalization
similar to the companies included in the Russell 2000 Index. The Japan
Fund invests primarily in common stocks of Japanese companies traded in
Japanese markets. The International Small Capitalization Fund will invest
primarily in equity securities of smaller companies that are traded principally
in securities markets outside the </font></p>

<ul>
<p><font SIZE=+1>U.S. and that have a current market capitalization between
$15 million and $1 billion. The funds will maintain risk factors and industry
exposures similar to their benchmarks. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>For over 25 years, Barr Rosenberg, the founder of Rosenberg
Institutional Equity Management, has pioneered the application of quantitative
techniques to solving sophisticated investment problems. His research is
the basis for much of the investment technology used by money managers
today. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management, formed in 1985,
currently manages approximately $3.4 billion - including $683 million invested
outside the U.S. - in broadly diversified equity portfolios for pension
funds, endowments and foundations. The firm maintains its headquarters
in Orinda, California and has offices in London, Tokyo and Singapore. </font></p>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Philosophy and Strategy<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
At Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management, we believe that
stock prices imperfectly reflect the present value of the expected
future earnings of companies, their &quot;fundamental value.&quot;
Over time, we believe that the price of a company's stock will
converge towards this fundamental value, and that any investor
who can accurately determine fundamental value and apply a disciplined
investment process to select undervalued stocks (based on a comparison
between current prices and fundamental value) will outperform
the market over time.
<P>
Our research convinces us that modest valuation errors among
groups of similar companies are present in every sector of the
market. We have developed a <A HREF="model.html" >series of quantitative models </A>which
rigorously analyze fundamental data to identify these misvaluations.
Using the results from these models, we build broadly diversified
portfolios of these undervalued stocks, holding the individual
stocks until the market recognizes and corrects the misvaluation.
Our Fund's portfolios are composed of undervalued stocks from
every size sector and industry group represented in each Fund's
specific benchmark, with the typical portfolio consisting of several
hundred stocks.
<P>
Each Barr Rosenberg Mutual Fund relies on our proprietary stock
selection and risk models. In constructing the portfolios for
the Funds, we will avoid significant deviations from the size,
industry and risk factor characteristics of the respective benchmark.
In addition, we will not seek to earn extraordinary return by
timing the market, so the Funds will remain nearly fully invested
in equities at all times.

the Risk Model helps build optimal portfolios. These models operate

<I>The Appraisal Model is the heart of our approach. This model
carefully analyzes the detailed fundamental data for all companies
in the market and determines the &quot;fair value&quot; for each
company. The model makes subtle and detailed measurement of the
value of every company's business, based upon a comprehensive
assessment of earnings, assets and sales in the industries in
which the company operates. The model appraises detailed line
items of the balance sheet and income statement, as well as off-balance
sheet items. The Appraisal Model identifies companies that are
currently priced below their fair value as stocks to buy.</I>

<FONT SIZE=4>Earnings Change Model</FONT>
<P>
<I>The Earnings Change Model forecasts future earnings for companies.
It enables Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds to invest in companies
that are expected to have superior future earnings growth, and
to sell companies that are expected to have declining earnings
in the future.</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Investor Sentiment Model</FONT>
<P>
<I>The Investor Sentiment Model forecasts short-term price trends.
It assists us in buying stocks before they have a rise in performance,
and in selling stocks before their prices fall. The model studies
detailed data on investor attitudes, including analysts' earnings
estimates, brokers' recommendations and dealers' positions as well as 
stock market returns and trading volume, to infer momentum and enthusiasm 
for individual stocks.</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Risk Model</FONT>
<P>
<I>The Risk Model uses the information developed by the stock
selection models to maximize return while minimizing active risk.
It predicts the contribution of each stock to the risk and reward
of the aggregate portfolio. The size of any one position is determined
by the optimizer as it constructs the most efficient portfolio.</I>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of Lead-Based Paint (LBP) poisoning is the Number 1 environmental cause of illness and death among pre-school children. The federal Centers for Disease Control reported that approximately one in six young children have elevated blood-lead levels associated with such adverse health problems as hemotologic and endocrinologic disorders, decreased intelligence and learning ability and behavioral distrubances.  As concerned parents, teachers, and owners of childcare centers and pre-schools, it is imperative to know if our homes, educational institutions, and recreational facilities pose potential Lead-Based Paint hazards to our children.  

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrors of Lead-Based Poisoning are common and all too real; the good news is Lead-Based Paint Poisoning IS entirely preventable.  There are two basic assessment techniques recognized by federal and state governments to determine Lead-Based Hazards.  The first is the Lead-Based Paint Risk Assessment which is designed to identify circumstances where children are at risk for Lead-Based Paint Poisoning generally in the forms of Lead contaminated dusts generated from renovations, soils and water.  The second is the Lead Inspection which is design to identify each structural component within the home or other facility which contains Lead-Based Paint.  Though banned in 1978, it is estimated that approximately fifty-seven million homes, excluding public housing contain Lead-Based paint.  

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentinel is committed to the elimination of childhood Lead poisoning; as a public service, we have designed the following Risk Assessment & Lead Inspections informational surveys.  These surveys are intended to alert parents and owners of facilities frequented by pre-school children of potential Lead-Based Paint dangers.  After completing the surveys, please proceed to the informational section entitled "Lead-Based Paint Poison Prevention" if your survey results indicate LBP risk factors are present.

<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<P><font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radon and it's daughter by-products are naturally occurring radioactive compounds resulting from the normal decay of uranium.  As radon gas forms, it seeps upward to the surface of the Earth and spews into the open air, quickly dissipating.  As it escapes through soil and rock, it may enter basements, foundations, or crawlspaces of houses and buildings through cracks and crevices.  Upon entering a dwelling, it may become concentrated inside, resulting in radon exposure risks to occupants.  While inhalation of radon gas poses the most significant health risk, radon gas may also pervade groundwater supplies, posing a health hazard in drinking water as well.</font></p> 
<P><font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to tobacco smoke, radon gas and its daughters are the most serious environmental carcinogen known.  It is invisible, tasteless and odorless; without proper testing, its presence cannot be detected.  Continued exposure to radon can significantly increase the risk for lung cancer.  As with many other environmental pollutants, risks due to radon exposure are far greater for smokers and those persons affected by passive smoking.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Action Level is 4 pCI/L.  The EPA has estimated that radon concentrations in 1 out of 4 homes in the United States exceeds the Action Level.</font>
<P><font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, radon can be easily detected and steps taken to greatly reduce radon risks.  Sentinel offers affordable test kits to measure radon levels in your home or occupied facility.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the oil embargo of the 1970s, greater emphasis has been placed on energy conservation measures. In particular, some of these such as the reduction of outside make-up air and the elimination of air infiltration have a direct effect on the indoor air quality of our building. Sentinel, Inc. personnel are trained in the procedures for monitoring indoor air quality including "sick building syndrome" and "building related illness". There is an increased awareness of potential health hazards associated with the indoor environment. The Sentinel staff of microbiologists, chemists and industrial hygienists are sensitive to these concerns and are experienced in the identification and subsequent cost effective treatment of IAQ problems commonly encountered.</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In providing IAQ services, Sentinel, Inc. personnel use only recognized procedures and practices recommended by OSHA, NIOSH, ASM, ASHRAE and ACGIH for air sampling and microbiological investigations including ASHRAE 62-89 "Ventilation for Indoor Air Quality Standard", NIOSH "Occupational Exposure Sampling Strategy Manual" and the ACGIH "Guidelines for the Assessment of Bioaerosols in the Indoor Environment".</P>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the oil embargo of the 1970s, greater emphasis has been placed on energy conservation measures. In particular, the reduction of outside make-up air and the elimination of air infiltration have had a direct effect on the indoor air quality of our buildings. As such, there is an increased awareness of potential health hazards associated with the indoor environment. The World Health Organization estimates that up to 30% of the office buildings worldwide may have significant problems, with up to 30% of the occupants experiencing health effects which may be related to poor IAQ. Health related complaints include headaches, sinus problems, congestion, dizziness, nausea, fatigue and irritation of the eyes, nose & throat. The Sentinel staff of microbiologists, chemists and industrial hygienists are sensitive to IAQ concerns and are experienced in the identification and subsequent cost effective treatment of IAQ problems commonly encountered.</P>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the answer to one or more of the above questions was "Yes", it is advisable that the following precautions be taken:
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have your pediatrician or the Department of Public Health check your child's blood lead level. Should your child's blood-lead level be elevated, your health care professional will recommend 
precautionary measures to follow and/or treatment for your child. Pregnant females answering "Yes" to
 any of the above questions should also have a blood test performed for Lead.  While the greatest concern
 for LBP poisoning is focused on young children and unborn fetuses because of the severe developmental
 impacts on these individuals, adults may also experience health risks to virtually every organ system in the body when lead is ingested or inhaled.  Therefore, adults answering "Yes" to one or more of the above questions, should also consider blood testing for Lead.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a Lead Risk Assessment performed by a Lead Risk Assessor accredited through the
 USEPA Model Curricula Program.  To obtain names of Accredited Risk Assessor in your area, you may 
call Sentinel for assistance at (205) 534-9800; Fax (205) 534-9878; or by<A href="MAILTO:sentinel@traveller.com"> e-mail</a>

<p><IMG ALIGN="Right" SRC="new-gaw2.gif" ALT="Generator Associate" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="145">
<font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accuracy and accessibility of information is of equal
importance. The companies who possess quick access to accurate information
about waste streams, waste quantity, disposal history and on-site inventory
have a distinct advantage over companies who do not. How organized are your
company's records? Knowing the disposition of your waste is important to
state regulators and Generator Associate is the answer.
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>MANIFEST Printing</B></center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to create shipping documents from scratch. The system contains an extensive list of transporters, disposal facilities and waste streams to make manifesting quick. If you choose to manage your inventory, just point at the on-site inventory to ship and you're done. Even if you are shipping waste to many different states, the system includes all state specific manifests. We can recommend several different printers for printing through these 6 and 8 part forms.
</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ESS can provide you with inexpensive dot-matrix printers for printing 6 and 8 part manifests.
</P>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>MANIFEST Returns and COD's</B></center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After shipping waste is complete, the system will help track and ensure the return of your manifests and track certificates of disposal, recycling, etc. These reminders insure your company has complete documentation to avoid potential costly fines.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Inventory CRADLE to GRAVE</B></center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GA is capable of handling your on-site waste inventory. As soon as waste begins accumulation, GA starts tracking the waste for eventual on-site disposal, on-site recycling or shipment to an off-site disposal facility. Generator Associate can handle repackaging of waste, consolidation of waste into other containers and disposal processing.
</P>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Container LABELING</B></center>
<br>
<p><IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="Right" SRC="cp3-75c.gif" ALT="Container Labels" WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="112">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GA is designed to make container labeling a side effect of your other work instead of a job unto itself. Simply select a manifest and GA prints all the labels you will need in just about any format. Bar coding of waste turns outbound shipments into a painless task.
</P>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where you need a manifest quickly, simply choose a profile and a generator and you're done.
</P>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>LAB PACK Support</B></center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are faced with sorting, packing and tracking individual items in a lab-pack, GA can help you catalog, organize and even bar code these items. GA tracks all of your lab-pack items individually, the container in which they are stored and the eventually destruction of the container's contents.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You begin by entering and categorizing each item in the system, optionally attaching a bar code. You then generate reports which group the items by compatibility class, physical characteristics, etc. And last, you assign each item to a container, optionally using the attached bar code to speed the process.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Disposal Facility DECISION SUPPORT</B></center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are faced with disposing of your waste off-site you want to choose dependable facilities which also provide a competitive price for their service. Generator Associate keeps up with all of your disposal facility pricing and where waste has gone historically. Drawing on this data, GA can provide you the information you need to quickly find a disposal site to match.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Waste Stream PROFILES</B></center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GA's extensive profiling capability makes characterizing waste a snap. Track as little or as much information as you need. You can quickly build manifests using your company's profiles. Destination facility profiles include their effective dates to remind you before your profiles are about to expire. You can easily create general profiles and customize them on your manifests.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Custom FORMS you design</B></center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generator Associate is flexible enough to handle just about any form you will need, even if they are specific to your company. The system contains a document editor which allows you to build upon the pre-designed forms. Should you need a special work order or other forms, simply start the editor, add your company logo and go from there!
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Management Reports</B></center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included are management reports which use your site's hazardous/non-hazardous waste disposal history. These reports can assist you with determining trends within your company.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Waste Disposal History</B></center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have recorded waste shipments, the system tracks the specific waste disposal costs for each shipment. The system automatically maintains a list of all shipments that have not been invoiced and allows you to quickly enter the disposal costs directly from the facility or contractor's invoice. You can easily request reports by waste stream/waste stream category (dept.) to pinpoint your waste disposal costs.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>State BIENNIAL reporting (forms OI and GM) and TAX forms</B></center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most states, reporting typically only comes once every two years, but when the time comes, collecting all the detailed records can be tedious at best. All companies must track a tremendous amount of information concerning hazardous waste, EPA I. D. numbers, waste streams and classes, transporter information and disposal certification to complete these reports for state regulators.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generator Associate turns your state reporting nightmare into a dream. Using waste receipts and outgoing shipments already tracked through manifesting, the system combines all of this information to automatically print the reports for you. Optionally, in some states you can submit the report using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Integrated SPREADSHEETS</B></center>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have accumulated historical data, Generator Associate allows you to quickly manipulated it using a built-in spreadsheet. With just a few easy menu choices you can manipulate your historical data using the system. For users who are already familiar with Excel, the system allows you to save the data in Excel spreadsheet format.
</P>

<P>
<font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accuracy and accessibility of information is of equal importance. The companies who possess quick access to accurate information about waste streams, waste quantity and disposal history, generator history and marketing data have a distinct advantage over companies who do not. How organized are your company's records? Servicing your customer's needs is important and Transporter Associate is the answer.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><a NAME="ManifestPrinting"><!----></A><b>Manifest Printing</b></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to create shipping documents from scratch. The system contains an extensive list of transporters, disposal facilities and waste streams to make manifesting quick. If you choose to manage your client's inventory, just point at the on-site inventory to ship and you are done. After shipping waste is complete, the system will help manage the return of your manifests and track certificates of disposal, recycling, etc.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentinel can provide you with inexpensive dot-matrix printers for printing 6 and 8 part manifests.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><A NAME="WorkOrders"><!-- --></A><B>Work Orders and Customer Quotes</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work orders capture your customer's service needs quickly. Once service requests are complete, TA can quickly generate quotes, manifests, custom forms or custom letters. TA tracks all your work orders and quotes so you know when and how many are completed and eventually accepted. When you are ready, TA provides equipment and personnel scheduling to fulfill your customer's needs.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With TA, you can quickly pull reports showing outstanding work orders, work orders lacking quotes or quotes lacking work orders, quotes accepted, etc. for any time period. TA combines these tasks to provide your company with great customer service management tools.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><A NAME="ContainerLabeling"><!-- --></A><B>Container Labeling</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TA is designed to make container labeling a side effect of your other work instead of a job unto itself. Simply select a manifest and TA prints all the labels you will need in just about any format. Bar coding of waste turns outbound shipments into a painless task.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where you need a manifest quickly, simply choose a profile, a generator, and you are done.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><A NAME="WasteStreamProfiles"><!-- --></A><B>Waste Stream Profiles</B></center>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TA's extensive profiling capability makes characterization of waste a snap.
Track as little or as much information as you need. The system can even partition
these profiles for easy generator client management, no need to wade through
hundreds of profiles.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><A NAME="LabPack"><!-- --></A><B>Lab Pack Support</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are faced with sorting, packing, and tracking individual items in a lab-pack, TA can help you catalog, organize and even bar code these items. TA tracks all of your lab-pack items individually, the container in which they are stored and the eventually destruction of the container's contents.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You begin by entering and categorizing each item in the system, optionally attaching a bar code. You then generate reports which group the items by compatibility class, physical characteristics, etc. And last, you assign each item to a container, optionally using the attached bar code to speed the process.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Disposal Facility Decision Support</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are faced with disposing of your client's waste off-site you want to choose dependable facilities which also provide a competitive price for their service. Transporter Associate keeps up with all of your disposal facility pricing and where waste has gone historically. Drawing on this data, <I>TA</I> can provide you with the information you need to quickly find a disposal site to match.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Waste Disposal History</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have recorded waste shipments, the system tracks the specific waste disposal costs for each shipment. The system automatically maintains a list of all shipments that have not been invoiced and allows you to quickly enter the disposal costs directly from the facility or contractor's invoice. You can easily request reports by waste stream/waste stream category (dept.) to pinpoint your waste disposal costs.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><A NAME="Forms"><!-- --></A><B>Forms You Design</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transporter Associate is flexible enough to handle just about any form you will need, even if they are specific to your company. The system contains a document editor which allows you to build upon the pre-designed forms. Should you need a special work order or quotation, simply start the editor, add your company logo and go from there!
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><A NAME="StateReporting"><!-- --></A><B>Transporter State Reporting and Generator
State Biennial reporting (forms OI and GM)</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transporter Associate can print the forms and calculate taxes required by state regulatory agencies. Drawing on the existing manifesting and shipment data, the system can automatically generate these forms for you. At any time, management can access your companies current liability instantly. In some states, you can submit your reports using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some environmental consulting firms assist their customer with filing state regulatory reports. It typically only comes once every two years, but when the time comes, collecting all the detailed records together can be tedious at best. Your company must track a tremendous amount of information concerning hazardous waste, EPA I.D. numbers, waste streams and classes, transporter information and disposal certification to complete these reports for state regulators.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Client Contact Management</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the most of your business contacts. Keep track of all manifesting, billing and site contact information in one place. Keep notes of your dealings with your clients. Print mail-merged letters and forms instantly. Transporter Associate does all of this easily to help you manage your business relationships more productively.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Generator Inventory Cradle to Grave</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as waste begins accumulation, TA starts tracking the waste for eventual on-site disposal, on-site recycling or shipment to an off-site disposal facility. Transporter Associate can handle repackaging of waste, consolidation of waste into other containers, tank storage and disposal processing.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Your Support and Training</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentinel provides extensive support to get your company up and running with Transporter Associate quickly. To keep your system up to date, we can offer extended service which includes updates for new features, changes in manifest forms, container labels and regulatory reporting requirements. We include unlimited phone support for answering your questions. If needed, Sentinel can provide you with on-site training.

<br>
<center><B>Manifest Printing</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to create shipping documents from scratch. The system contains an extensive list of transporters, disposal facilities and waste streams to make manifesting quick. If you choose to manage generator inventory, just point at the on-site inventory to ship and you're done. After shipping waste is complete, the system will help manage the return of your manifests and track certificates of disposal, recycling, etc.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Container Labeling</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>MA</I> is designed to make container labeling a side effect of your other work instead of a job unto itself.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where you need a manifest quickly, simply choose a profile, a generator and you're done.

<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Disposal Facility Descision Support</B></center>

<center><B>Waste Disposal History</B></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have recorded waste shipments, the system tracks the specific waste disposal costs for each shipment. The system automatically maintains a list of all shipments that have not been invoiced and allows you to quickly enter the disposal costs directly from the facility or contractor's invoice. You can easily request reports by waste stream/waste stream category (dept.) to pinpoint your waste disposal costs.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>

    HEIGHT="145"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accuracy and accessibility of information is of equal importance. The companies who possess a quick means of creating accurate forms and labels have a distinct advantage over companies who do not. How organized easily can your company create these documents? Accurate&nbsp;waste forms are important to state regulators and Forms Associate is the answer.

<br>

<br>
<center><A NAME="1"><!-- --></A><B>Manifest Printing</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to create shipping documents from scratch. The system contains an extensive list of transporters, disposal facilities and waste streams to make manifesting quick. If you choose to manage your inventory, just point at the on-site inventory to ship and you're done. Even if you are shipping waste to many different states, the system includes all state specific manifests. We can recommend several different printers for printing through these 6 and 8 part forms.
</p>
<br>

<p><IMG BORDER="0" ALIGN="Right" SRC="cp3-75c.gif" ALT="Container Labels" WIDTH="124" HEIGHT="112">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FMA is designed to make container labeling a side effect of your other work instead of a job unto itself. Simply select a manifest and FMA prints all the labels you will need in just about any format. Bar coding of waste turnsoutbound shipments into a painless task.
</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where you need a manifest quickly, simply choose a profile and a generator and you're done.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Custom Forms You Design</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forms Associate&#174 is flexible enough to handle just about any form you will need, even if they are specific to your company. The system contains a document editor which allows you to build upon the pre-designed forms. Should you need a special work order or other forms, simply start the editor, add your company logo and go from there!
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Management Reports</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included are management reports which use your site's hazardous/non-hazardous waste disposal history. These reports can assist you with determining trends within your company.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Integrated Spreadsheets</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you have accumulated historical data, Forms Associate&#174 allows you to quickly manipulated it using a built-in spreadsheet. With just a few easy menu choices you can manipulate your historical data using the system. For users who are already familiar with Excel, the system allows you to save the data in Excel spreadsheet format.
</p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><B>Easily Import from Legacy Systems</B></center>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases companies will have an existing system for tracking some part of their hazardous waste and/or material. Forms Associate&#174 has a user friendly import feature to smooth your transition. Importing can draw upon any DBF or comma-delimited format file.

<br>
<center><font size=5><b>Technical Specifications</b></font></center>
<p><font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tank Manager&#174 was designed to help those who are responsible for maintaining or inspecting aboveground storage tanks (AST) or underground storage tanks (UST).  With Tank Manager&#174 , you can schedule inspections and maintenance, track inspection results, record inventory levels and provide detailed or summary reports on the information entered.</font></p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><font size=5><b>Regulatory Compliance</b></font></center>
<p><font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently a wide variety of regulations, codes, and standards dealing with aboveground and underground storage tanks.  Regulations exist on the national, state and, in some locations, local levels.  Tank Manager&#174 is designed to help you stay in compliance with these regulations.  The program assists you to ensure required inspections are performed on time, and inspection results are recorded and available for review and analysis.  Tank Manager&#174  will also track the inspection histories for each aboveground storage tank, documenting and recordkeeping requirements of current regulations.</font></p>
<br>
<center><img src="senhr.gif" height="5" width="536"></center>
<br>
<center><font size=5><b>Inventory Management</b></font></center>
<p><font size=4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tank Manager&#174 will track all of your aboveground and underground storage tanks as well as the product and inventory levels in each of these tanks.

<br>
<center><font size=5><b>Predictive Maintenance</b></font></center>
<p><font size=4>Tank Manager&#174 includes fields to allow you to enter specific inspection results including engineering tests and thickness readings.  Keeping track of wall thickness, bottom plate thickness, and settlement information can help you determine corrosion and deterioration rates, which is extremely useful in predicting possible failures.  By taking a proactive approach to predictive maintenance, you can prevent unexpected failures before they happen, thus reducing downtime, product loss, and associated cleanup costs of leakage.</font></p>
