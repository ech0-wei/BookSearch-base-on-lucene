COMMENT

Cable telephony is not futuristic, it's happening now, cutting users'
bills and earning cable operators significant profits, utilising
existing catv infrastructures. It's also a vital component in cable's
move to being the first choice provider of access to interactive
services.

Yet in the UK where liberalisation occurred some five years ago, an
astonishing 65 per cent of UK telecoms managers did not even know that
cable TV companies offered telephony services according to a recent CIT
Research report, Business Telecoms trends in the UK 1995.

This level of ineptitude in marketing, this gross failure to accelerate
the recouping of capital investment, is almost beyond belief. If the
telecommunications professionals don't even know that cable is here in
the telecom market is it any surprise that connection rates generally
are not higher? It means that the salesman is often trying to persuade
people to buy something that many have never even heard of.

The UK may be a test bed for liberalised cable technology, but probably
the biggest lesson learnt from the British experiment is how not to
market cable telephony.

Let your customers know what you are offering and what its benefits are
- its so simple - isn't it? So why hasn't it happened in Britain?
Because, CCA notwithstanding, the UK's cable operators are more divided
than the former Yugoslavia. In five years they have never managed to
cooperate sufficiently well to be able to put out a single national
campaign on terrestrial TV.

And yet despite almost no one knowing cable telephony exists, it is a
roaring success with penetration rates and income levels exceeding
catv. It makes you wonder how many people would know who to call to
install cable TV, or even know if that is available in their area.

No such problems in Chile or Russia, to name but two countries where
the shortage of copper in the ground (what an ironic statement to make
about Chile) means that integrated hybrid coax fibre from the catv
companies is actually a preferred route to introduce telephony. For
countries such as Holland where a mature cable network exists, the use
of ASDL upgrading, or overlay technologies may look more appealing -
certainly financially given the costs of laying cable.

In truth there is not one simple answer, and local circumstances,
including infrastructure and regulatory climate and historical/cultural
factors will dictate the route to converged interactive services.

But there can surely be no doubting now that this is the destination of
the superhighway, and whether you upgrade your current route or build a
new one, without an on-ramp your country and economy is doomed to
suffer the plight of an information backwater.

SPANISH FRANCHISES IN CHAOS

The Spanish cable law bill, finally approved by parliament, comes into
force early this month (December) backed by all political parties
except the conservative Partido Popular, which remains firmly opposed
to the bill.

The first legal cable licences are to be awarded by the government by
mid-1996, for 15 year periods. The PP says the Spanish parliament is
churlish rushing through the new cable law without the support of a
party which could be in power by spring, and claimed the bill was anti-
competitive and advantaged Telefonica.

Madrid, Valencia and Vigo, whose councils are held by PP, have given
the go-ahead to public meetings awarding cable licences on their own
terms. Minister of public works Jose Borrell commented, "Investors in
these towns are taking a big risk because the licences are just for
television and not any other services, which must comply with the law."
Other political parties warned of the possibility these licences being
nullified.

A spokesman for Spanish Cable Telecommunications Association, Ademat,
adds, "We are against this law as it is incomplete and does not prevent
monopolies like Telefonica/Canal Plus." Cablevision, a joint venture
between Telefonica and Canal Plus, started a 5,000 home test
transmission in Barcelona, running until January 31 offering 34
channels for free.

Cable operator Multitel says that Telefonica will retain its dominant
position as it can offer television and telephony services before other
operators who must wait for liberalisation in 1998. Multitel added that
limits on the number of subscribers should refer to the number of homes
passed not subscribed ones. The cable bill states that no operator can
have over 1.5 million subscribers (almost 5 million homes passed) to
prevent a company having 50 per cent of the potential cable market (12
million homes).

The PP has since said it will award cable licences at the beginning of
December in all 54 towns with over 100,000 inhabitants in which it
governs. These licences would cover telecoms and catv, and run for 20
years.

Telefonica will also need to receive the PP's go-ahead to operate catv.
However, the PP will not allow municipal investment in local cable
networks, while foreign ownership will be restricted to 40 per cent.

Sandy Saunderson has been appointed director of business
telecommunications at Cable London with responsibility for business
telephony and television.

TELEPHONY LEADS GROWTH

Videotron's latest figures show dramatic growth in revenue and
operating cash flow led by telephony, with a 53 per cent revenue
increase to #57.5 million for the fiscal year ending August 31, but net
losses doubled to #13.2 million.

Residential telephony revenues are up a vast 79.9 per cent to #27.3
million, exceeded by business telephony, up 87.9 per cent to #5.7
million, telephony income having overtaken catv revenues (themselves up
26.5 per cent to #24.5 million) to account for almost 60 per cent of
revenues. Operating cash flow/EBITDA has more than doubled, from #2.2
in 1994 to #6.9 million in 1995.

"We have entered the new fiscal year with 45 per cent of our network
built-out for cable television and 39 per cent for both cable
television and residential telephone. The forthcoming year will be
marked by our transition from a high technology construction company to
a full-service telecommunications company," says Louis Brunel,
Videotron CEO and managing director.

Total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 (compared to 1994)
saw 38.6 per cent growth to #15.8 million; catv revenues jumped 26.5
per cent to #6.5 million for the quarter with monthly revenue per
customer up from #20.25 to #21.28. Annualised churn came down from 31.2
per cent to 29.6 per cent despite a rate card increase.

Residential telephony revenues of #31.18 per month were achieved, with
churn of 17.4 per cent. The quarter's business telecommunications
revenues were up a third to #1.5 million with business churn falling
from 20.3 per cent to 17 per cent. Loss from operations was #2.0
million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995, up 60 per cent, with the
year's losses at #7.4 million, up 34.2 per cent.

DUTCH REGULATORY DISPUTE

The Dutch cable regulatory regime looks set to be altered following two
broadcasters - Eurosport and Arcade - each filing complaints alleging
operators had abused their local monopolies when they asked for high
carriage fees. Junior minister of culture Ad Nuis said he would prefer
cable operators to come under general competition law, but
parliamentarians appear to favour a new law directed specifically at
the sector, a view which gained extra support following the cable
operators' poor performance at a recent parliamentary hearing.

Nuis received support for a separate proposal to transform Holland's
public broadcasting system by merging the 30-plus pubcasters into a
single network by the year 2000. He proposed that the a newly-formed
public body would offer one or two channels instead of the current
three, with one of the services remaining commercial-free.

Nuis appointed a committee to study the future of the Dutch public
broadcasting system. Chaired by Democrat Mijndert Ververs, the group
will make its recommendations by April, allowin further debate before
summer's parliamentary recess.

EXPRESSVU SCHEDULES LAUNCH FOR DECEMBER 1

Canada Canadian DTH provider ExpressVu finally scheduled its launch for
December 1, delayed from September 1. Blaming the late launch on the
Canadian cable industry, ExpressVu explained that a shortage or
transponder space on Anik E-1 was caused by the cablecos refusing to
get out of the way. Instead of delivering the 100 channels the company
had hoped for, ExpressVu will launch with 40, and move up to over 100
early in 1996, when transponder space becomes available. .

DISNEY CHANNEL TELLS OPERATORS TO OFFER THE CHANNEL AS A FREE BONUS

UK The Disney Channel has told cable operators that they have to
continue to offer the channel as a free bonus channel to subscribers
who take both BSkyB premium movie channels. This is despite a ruling
from the UK Office of Fair Trading saying that BSkyB must offer The
Disney Channel to cable operators on a non-exclusive basis - enabling
the operators to negotiate carriage terms directly with Disney.

ECC '95 PREVIEWS INTERACTIVITY

October's European Cable Communications show was the biggest dedicated
cable event on the continent, with all the main hardware and software
companies present, the telecos taking further steps into the cable
market, a range of cable targeted programming companies, from Travel
and NCB to Playboy,TVX and Penthouse - the latter two hot channels in a
frosty ownership dispute to UK rights, and attendance from throughout
Europe.

Response to the conference was also positive, boosting international
representation with several East European visitors in addition to
visitors from the rest of Europe, Israel, Turkey and India.

The majority of exhibitors and visitors remained British.

Convergence, DVB and MPEG compliance featured strongly throughout the
show - some of the thunder stolen by major unveilings at Telecom '95 in
Geneva less than a fortnight before.

In his opening speech, UK minister for science and technology, Ian
Taylor declared "Anti-competitive or restrictive behaviour will elicit
a firm response from the authorities." In a thinly-veiled warning to
BSkyB, Taylor said that although companies which risk their capital and
work hard are entitled to a commensurate return, ignoring de facto
monopolies could do as much harm as restoring legal monopolies. The
government would tighten up its regulation of pay-TV and access
systems.

The head of the European Commission directorate general for competition
Herbert Ungerer also delivered a warning to 'gatekeepers' of
conditional access saying markets must first be liberalised before
dominant players can be allowed to join forces. "We cannot risk digital
interactive TV or global mobile satellite systems markets being sewn up
by defensive commercial moves before they are open to competition. The
risk of collusion and abuse of dominant position clearly outweighed
potential benefits of co-operation and convergence," said Ungerer,
citing the proposed alliance between Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom and
the Kirch-group in Germany.

De facto monopolies were also attacked by the director general of the
UK telecommunications regulatory body Oftel, Don Cruickshank who
criticised BT's agreement with the labour party, saying that it was
anti-competitive in nature.

Director-general of the CCA Richard Woollam described BT's deal with
labour as "an attempt to destabilise investor companies."

During the show the UK's three largest cable companies, Nynex
Cablecomms, Telewest and Bell Cablemedia announced they are to launch
the first phase of the multimedia services trial in January 1996 to
lead to the development of commercial applications, as well as
establish standards to achievement the equivalent of a single national
network for multimedia broadband services.

Comcast is to roll-out digital music service Music Choice to its
Cleveland and Darlington franchises following its successful launch in
Birmingham adding a potential 225,000 homes to Music Choice's reach.

Scottish Television is to launch a cable channel, the Scottish Channel,
to be entirely made in Scotland, following the channel's recent
alliance with Flextech.

The Travel channel launched an Internet Web site in conjunction with
its US sister company, The Travel Channel. The Web site will allow an
estimated 35 million Internet users free access to an on-line network,
comprising a wide range of interactive travel information. Truly
complementary, additional data on programmed destinations is provided
by Internet, which alerts browsers to forthcoming programmes likely to
be of interest to Web surfers. Access the web using the following URL :
http://www.travelchannel.com/

European Business News is launching a new weekend show for teenagers
and students The Insiders' Guide To Business, designed to demystify
business concepts and jargon and encourage young people to see business
in a new way.

Ericsson launched its new Pay TV Delivery System offering extended
services such as pay per view and premium channels over cable networks
without the subscriber needing to install any additional equipment. It
also demonstrated its Universal Personal Telecom-munication and hybrid
fibre/ coax video telephony system.

Scientific Atlanta introduced its new System 70 fibre optic platform,
supporting applications such as low cost broadband delivery of basic
programming, targeted service delivery to small pockets of subscribers,
ring interconnection and headend consolidation.

Bytel announced the release 26 of its care and billing system Bytel SMS
with additional functionality for cable and telecommunications
operators.

Ascom Telecommunications showed its Baseband ATM modems. CableData
demonstrated its Intelecable Interactive Broadband Module used to
manage and bill interactive services such as VOD. It also showed
interactive service features such as Viewer Profile and transaction
Processing on Intelecable.

BSKYB - "WE WERE RIGHT"

Allen Saunders, executive director, corporate communications at Nynex
CableComms UK, is disappointed with current catv market penetration,
but emphasises low churn rates

Nynex now has 40 per cent of its UK franchises built out, with 165,000
catv subscribers and 190,000 telephone lines installed, and is on
schedule to complete its system, passing 2.7 million homes, by the end
of 1998.

But first nine months pre-tax losses rose 51 per cent to #78.5 million
for 1995 compared to the same period 1994 - as expected.

Residential telephony is a significant success story, with penetration
at 23.8 per cent, and revenues more than doubled to #24.2 million,
vindicating the policy of maintaining a 25 per cent differential below
BT rates. But catv penetration at 18.9 per cent falling from 19.5 per
cent, and significantly short of the industry average of 21 to 22 per
cent. Television revenues doubled - to #26.4 million, and turnover for
the period also doubled, to #57.1 million.

Saunders comments, "We are not satisfied with the level of penetration
and this is a high priority issue for us - we place a great emhpasis on
keeping our churn rates down, probably the lowest in the industry. What
is critical is customer retention. Our last published telephony churn
figure was 15.8 per cent - industry estimates suggest 12 per cent is
accounted for by people moving house and those taken off for bad debt.
We don't really make it easy as we have a 12 month contract, strongly
encourage direct debit, and we don't offer free or discounted
introductory services."

"The product mix is good and getting better with channels like Disney,
and there will be several more coming on in 1996 when we are confident
the industry will break through the barrier. It has grown faster than
the US, developing a multichannel service in just four years."

Nynex was criticised by other cable companies when, along with
Telewest, it entered into a separate agreement with BSkyB. Saunders
says, "It was the right thing to do at the time; after Oftel's
intervention, the rest of the industry ended up with better terms.

"Bundling of programmes is an issue that has to be addressed. My
personal view is that catv will evetnually become an a la carte
service. As a viewer, I want to pay for what I want, when I want it.
People are currently being forced to take channels that they don't
want."

"Some companies have been successful with packages and others with a la
carte so it is not clear which is the best system. There has to be some
latitude in programme packaging and this will be a key factor in
getting revenues from our customers."

On Murdoch, Saunders said, "You have to admire what he has done - he
bet his business on satellite in the UK. But you must question the
Hollywood studios signing up films for such a long time - and Premier
League TV."

"As individual operators we probably haven't done a good job of
explaining our excellent product mix. Our marketing has not been so
good. On telephony - we have brought true competition to BT and have
helped the end user. We have considerble experience in the telecoms
world - its not new to us. People are amazed at the cost savings (of
switching to cable)."

"Number portability due in 1996 could add five to 10 per cent of homes
passed, increasing our penetration 25 per cent ."

Cable telephony probably won't retain its current levels of cost
differential next century as regulators bring BT costs down - then the
differentiation will be the service provider. "Our philosophy is to get
the customer for life. Both the level of service and the service range
has to be the latest and the best - you can't have a failing network."

Would Nynex use ADSL technology to bring (existing) networks to the
standard of fibre? "No. In the US we are committing to change copper
networks for fibre. The Select Party review which said early entry by
BT into the entertainment market would result in #10 billion to upgrade
to fibre described something which it is going to have to do anyway."

"A billion pounds was wiped off cable stock when (oppositionleader)
Blair made his unclear statement. What will they (BT) do to help the
hospitals, schools or libraries that they have connected? We are the
unsung heroes, connecting them today."

There was a silver lining however as, "It was a key part of Blair's
speech and so it was good to get cable on the political agenda. It has
a raised public awareness of cable."

On new technologies, Saunders explained, "We have commercial
interactive services on trial and have talked with a lot of people, but
nothing is concluded at this stage. There is a market requirement for
games, but it has to be packaged at the right price for the user. We
welcome PPV coming in and expect to have something in place in 1996. We
expect time shifting will also be a great winner, provided as a form of
pay per view."

Lack of commercial interactive services reflects perceived market
readiness, availability of service providers and pricing rather than
implementation issues explains Saunders, declaring, "Technology is not
a problem, we have a network that will take whatever you want put down
it."

TELEPHONY: THE BIG PICTURE

A new report on the UK Cable Market from Goldman Sachs provides an
excellent overview of the current UK cable market, including many
observations on cable telephony in the UK that will have relevance to
other catv operators looking to introduce telephony

The main thrust of the report is that competition will continue to
increase and prices will fall, but that the market remains a lucrative
one with great potential for revenue earnings, though its relative
small size could result in mergers.

Combined catv/telephony revenues in the UK are currently around #60
($100) per home, triple the $32 per home achieved in the US. Cable
franchise areas are exclusive and interconnect charges are regulated,
so profitability is ensured, which has spurned on the UK build rate,
leaping 55 per cent to 850,000 homes passed in the first half of 1995.

Long term forecasts for cable telephony penetration are 38 per cent by
2003, but the average residential penetration is 25 per cent though
Diamond Cable is achieving 45 per cent. This has been achieved prior to
number portability which should be in force in 1996 - forecast to boost
penetration by 6 to 8 per cent. "The lack of portability acts as a
disincentive to changing supplier and if this barrier is removed I am
convinced that suppliers will strive to improve their services to
attract new customers and improve efficiency," says Don Cruickshank,
director general of Oftel.

Business telephony penetration varies wildly between operators, from
single figures to 23 per cent, and it accounts for 45 per cent of
revenues at Diamond Cable.

BT has a 90 per cent share of the #12.8 bn ($20.2 bn) UK telephony
market. But since opening up, this relatively small market has become
highly competitive with multiple long distance operators, multiple
wireless operators, and a growing number of local exchange operators
(BT, Mercury, Colt and the cable operators) hence there is expected to
be pressure for consolidation. Goldman Sachs suggests that UK cable
revenues (including catv and interactive services) are set to rise
1,900 per cent from #350 m ($553 m) in 1994 to #6.7 bn ($10.59 bn) by
2003.

Interconnect pricing is controlled by Oftel, but if and when BT looses
more than 25 per cent of the market (expected around 2001), current
legislation says cable will have to pay an Access Deficit Charge,
contributing toward the subsidy that BT claims it makes in local
interconnect pricing - though by that time open competition is
expected.

Meanwhile, BT is expected to increase its competition for the local
loop on the basis of Oftel dictated pricing - annual price reductions
equal to inflation (RPI) minus a productivity factor of 7.5 per cent
through to 1997. This equals some #400 m of annual price reductions,
but BT staffing is falling by 10,000 per year saving #250 m with
further savings in office space etc while lines are growing by 2 per
cent annually. BT would need to spend #15 billion ($23.7 bn) to rebuild
its network with fibre optic cabling. Most regional Bell Operating
Companies in the US have announced switched broadband overlay trials,
rather than using ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line)
technology, and so BT was expected to upgrade its network to fibre. But
a potential future Labour government (currently poll favourites) may
legislate to make it attractive to BT to interconnect with cable for
broadband services in the local loop rather than replicate the cable
companies' network.

Telecommunication companies Mercury and Energis are not seen as local
loop competitors, but their direct competition with BT in the long
distance interconnect should reduce interconnect charges to cable
companies. BT has introduced a range of incentives to maintain its
customers and also sends direct mail and calls people in newly cabled
areas to dissuade them from subscribing to cable telephony. It has also
(up until now) refused customer's number portability to cable, and
markets satellite dishes through its BT shops.

Videotron and Diamond Cable have responded by offering free local calls
between cable subscribers, and in all categories, cable telephony has
responded to BT price cuts, maintaining a pricing differential of 10 to
15 per cent below BT in every tariff category, with Nynex CableComms
saying it will maintain a 25 per cent discount to BT for the medium
term.

Another problem for BT is that it is the higher usage customers which
it is loosing. BT's average monthly residential spend is #18.50
compared to cable's residential telephony spend of #24. This may result
in targeted price reductions from BT in relation to specific
competitors and sectors, but it is not allowed to vary its pricing
geographically. However, it can use strategies such as price discounts
to selected numbers which are also BT, so that one person switching
would affect a whole circle of friends.

Both usage and the number of lines in the market is expanding
sufficiently to more than make up for the price declines as falling
prices stimulate usage growth.

In the face of falling prices, the report says success in the
telecommunications market will increasingly be driven by product
innovation, itself driven by software and marketing which highlights
these innovations.

Cable companies are buying the latest generation of switches to lead
the introduction of new services including voice mail, and Teen Talk
(Bell Cable) with different numbers on the same line.

The introduction of Centrex in business sites provides phantom PBX
internal communications solutions to form the local switch.

In London the interconnect local group has launched Integrated
Communications Network capital wide, offering private networks and
circuits and high speed data links plus standard telephony. This is
expected to be followed by the launch of a national cable business
telephony initiative with its own branding, expected within 18 months,
possibly using a company such as Energis for its long distance
operator.

BT and Mercury interconnection charges including local switching make
investment by cable companies in their own switches not only viable but
virtually inevitable, and most now have their own local switching
(Digital Local Exchanges). For an optimal nationally switched network,
a national joint venture between cable companies and perhaps a third
party is postulated.

Cable companies are advised to bid for wireless local loop licences in
their own areas for both defensive and offensive reasons, as the main
cost is the headend switching which could be merged with the catv
headend - and wireless would extend cable's telecommunication service
into rural areas.

For US companies looking to replicate their success in the UK back
home, costs will be higher as they will have to upgrade existing cable
plant through hybrid fibre/coax rebuilds and the deployment of
switching, independent power and subscriber network interface devices.

LOCAL LOOP BARS COMPETITION

Removing the local loop from state monopolies is seen as the biggest
barrier to competition, with the local loop accounting for 70 per cent
of the huge cost of building a national phone network.

The stranglehold on local telephone lines by state-owned monopolies
like France Telekom and Deutsche Telecom threatens to prevent the
genuine opening of European telecoms markets to competition by the
start of 1998 says a new report by the Economist Intelligence Unit. It
suggests that the local loop should be owned by independent companies
concerned only with providing local access for any telecom operator,
and that these companies should get a set exclusive period in return
for upgrading the network to handle multimedia services.

BT in the UK saw its labour force cut by some 40 per cent (100,000
jobs) following privatisation, hence there is strong political and
union pressure to prevent a repetition in continental Europe's PTTs.

The Association of Private European Cable Operators (Apec) has called
on Europe's regulatory authorities to allow catv operators to directly
interconnect their networks, not via telecom leased lines but by their
own means - similar to the interconnect groups now being established in
the UK. It has also called for liberalisation of telephony on
alternative infrastructures before January 1998, with the January 1996
limited liberalisation as merely a timid first step.

Again, mirroring the UK model, Apec has called for seven to 10 year
periods of exclusivity rather than allowing public telecoms
organisations to enter entertainment markets as sooon as cable
operators enter voice telephony, citing the PTTs dominant postion and
decades-old monopolies as advantages to be overcome. A quick solution
to the problems of number portability and universal service are also
called for.

CORNERSTONE OFFERS COMPETITIVE EDGE

Global catv market players are increasingly turning to suppliers for
services beyond traditional voice switching to provide a competitive
edge to attract subscriber business.

Commercially attractive solutions are sought in the switching,
transport and access portions of their broadband networks. Nortel in
the UK is enlarging its product portfolio to meet this demand by
operators to deploy advanced data and multimedia services to business
and residential communities.

Flexibility is an essential part of Nortel's Cornerstone range which
comprises a family of coax access systems that interface seamlessly
with its switching, data and transmission products and can be tailored
to specific catv franchise requirements.

Cornerstone allows catv operators to introduce multiple services on to
their networks incrementally.

Cornerstone Voice and Cornerstone Data, enable existing HFC networks to
carry additional services, generating new revenue through controlled
incremental investment.

The Voice option enables narrowband services, from standard telephony
to advanced CLASS (customer local area signalling) features - such as
caller ID and call waiting - to be delivered over standard HFC plant.
Transmission quality, reliability and grade of service can exceed the
current copper telephony infrastructure.

Cornerstone Data enables catv operators to enter the growing home
working market, delivering high-speed data communications services
across their existing network, letting the service provider offer a
highly-competitive quality of service and feature set.

The emphasis is on delivery at a reasonable cost to subscribers, with
only minor modifications to existing cable plant and low capital
investment, even at low penetration levels.

By sharing bandwidth among a number of users, the Data option provides
a high peak rate to each user as most users only need network access
for a short time, downloading Web pages, or graphics files from an
office server. It uses ATM between the head-end and the data port to
ensure bandwidth is fairly distributed between users.

Cornerstone Data also lets operators charge users for the bandwidth
they take, not their connect time, allowing subscribers to browse
without having to disconnect then re-connect to a service and without
incurring bills for idle connect time.

Future Cornerstone products undergoing field trials offer multimedia
and wireless applications. Multimedia applications include highly
interactive services such as educational VOD, home shopping and
interactive games.

Cablevision Lightpath, the telephony subsidiary of Cablevision Systems,
is piloting and plans wide-scale deployment of services based on
Cornerstone Voice over its catv network in the New York City area. New
Brunswick Telephone is the first implementation of multimedia
applications with services due to include educational VOD, interactive
home shopping and advanced telecommunications services.

In October, Bell Cablemedia chose Nortel's ATM Magellan Passport switch
to run BCM's pilot data service in its London franchise area. This new
network includes Internet access, videoconferencing, LAN
interconnection and voice over ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode).
Magellan Passports are being deployed alongside Nortel Rapport Internet
access dial-up switches.

LOW-COST INTERACTIVITY IMPLEMENTED AND OPERATIONAL

Israel's Gad Line has developed a communication system for telephony
over cable allowing low cost implementation of a variety of interactive
applications which is already fully operational, serving subscribers
worldwide. Gad Line saw the potential to take advantage of the two-way
broadband coax/fibre network infrastructure by utilising it to meet the
demand for efficient two-way video, voice and data communication
channels.

Its voice/data system incorporates communal telephony, public telephony
emergency and security features, data transfer including facsimiles,
the Internet etc and utility management. The utility feature has been
implemented by a German electric company to monitor electricity
consumption, and an exclusive residential complex in Brazil uses the
system for its security and internal telephony features. Other
voice/data systems have been installed internationally. The system's
largest contract is for the telephonic networking of Tianjin, China,
with its population of 8 million.

By mid-1996 Gad Line expects to have pilot schemes starting on its
digital system for the transfer of E1/T1, long-distance learning, home
shopping, VOD etc utilising microelectronic integrated technology
within one unified system.

The existing analogue voice/data system utilises frequencies which are
not occupied by the cable television channels over the catv network
with FDM technology with FSK modulation. The system comprises a
subscriber modem as the basic unit which is sited at the home or office
of the use. This unit interfaces between a standard telephone, fax or
computer and the catv network. It blocks noisy frequencies, allocates
the free frequencies to the subscribers, and is used for assigning ad
changing subscriber ID numbers.

Trunk interface units and trunk protocol converters perform the link
and the protocol conversion between the Public Switched Telephony
network and the telephony over cable system.

HYBRID FIBRE COAX CABLE TELEPHONY ON SHOW

During ECC '95 Ericsson demonstrated its hybrid fibre coax telephone
delivery system, developed in collaboration with First Pacific
Networks. There is no telephony overlay in integrated delivery - only
the hybrid fibre coax cable TV network is built. An RF modem in the
home connects to the incoming coax and provides a master socket and an
outlet at the set top box for cable TV. FPN's 10001 product has proven
itself in the UK, reducing overall build costs.

LETTING THE LOOP LOOSE

Terry Meredith of West End discusses integrating telephony and TV in a
cable network using HFC with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
to overcome capacity limits on the local loop

The initial premise is that operators using hybrid fibre/coax (HFC) can
save between 10 to 30 per cent in costs (depending on the country)
compared to an overlay approach. Using HFC, operators with installed
catv networks can avoid the civils cost of cable laying, gaining
privacy and security, which must be ensured by HFC due to the change
from a traditional copper star wired network to a shared star/bus
architecture.

Bandwidth efficiency is essential. The return path of a catv network is
typically five to 55 MHz, and an integrated HFC architecture must pack
circuits into this bandwidth without lowering the grade of service or
needing the local loop to be engineered.

Reliability of catv networks must also be assured, enabling them to
support lifeline telephony services, and so power plant must be planned
to provide the necessary levels of resilience, with home units
providing various powering options. Also, integrated TV/telephony must
provide flexible end to end service provision.

When looking at the architectural options available, HFC is the first
choice due to its broadband capability, with RF catv designs able to
provide multiple services on a single network. Standard catv
architecture with a bolt-on approach is the most cost effective
solution, eliminating construction, minimising cost and delivering
services to the customer as soon as they sign on.

In a catv network which has a return path implemented, telephony (plus
data and interactive services) can be added using the WestBound 9600
Broadband Access Platform by connecting a WestBound 9645 Broadband
Manager at the headend and one of a range of subscriber drops at the
user end. The WestBound 9600 supports multiple value added services
such as internet access and telephony. Every 64kB/s channel from the
headend is guaranteed a path in the same way as a traditional copper
network PTT, so there is no blocking and the integral cross connect
functionality at the head end is an important factor for leased line
networks.

It is possible to pack 480 x 64K channels into one 8MHz catv channel in
a totally on-blocking way eg 12 MHz supporting 720 channels provide for
greater than 100 per cent penetration in a typical HFC catv design. And
there are a range of other benefits accruing from use of orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing - utilising 500 carriers (tones) each
2kHz wide and carrying 10kB/s of information. If ingress hits one of
the 2kHz bands, its affect is minimal, unlike single carrier systems
such as QPSK.

Security features include unique frequency allocation per subscriber,
and inherent random scrambling, similar to PCM AMI techniques.

Multiple integrated services for the residential and business market
include supporting digital or analogue telephony, with Centrex working,
leased line services for telephony and data, Lan interconnect services
with optional integral frame relay connectivity; teleworking
home/office connections, remote Lan, speeds up to 256kB/s; Infonet
services to add information services and gateways to third parties such
as the Internet. Future uses are expected to incorporate multimedia
services networks and the architecture - if not the infrastructure - is
already established to handle these services.

Continental Europe is particularly enthusiastic about employing 'bolt-
on' solutions to introduce telephony while the UK has an overlay
mentality, whereas in Eastern Europe and Latin America there are
bottlenecks in their local loops, with not enough copper in the ground,
are finding it more cost effective to increase telephony via catv
development. "We are aiming to be the local loop company in these
countries," says Meredith.

PARTNERSHIPS EXTEND ADC BROADBAND OFFERING

During Telecom 95 ADC Telecommunications Inc and Nokia
Telecommunications signed an agreement to cooperate on product
development for the global cable TV and telecommunications markets
based on ADC's Homeworx hybrid fibre coax broadband access platform and
Nokia's ACM2 access products. This will include joint development of
interfaces for EISI standard countries, and joint development of next
generation broadband platform solutions

"Our overlay system uses Nokia's SDH overlay for data using ACM2 - we
can take overlay networks to integrated networks," explained ADC's
Lynne High, adding that the cooperation meant the companies were able
to expand more rapidly, from a video product today to the incorporation
of voice/data from the same company.

ACM2 is a two megabit per second primary rate family for voice and data
services, while the Homeworx platform transports both digital and
broadband signals as well as narrowband telephony and data services
over HFC. ADC has also formed a telecom alliance with Hitachi telecom,
initially focused on sales and marketing, offering an end-to-end
solution for customers, including marketing Hitachi's Synchronous
optical network and ATM equipment with ADC's Soneplex and Homeworx
broadband access/transport platforms. A second phase will include a
joint venture for new products and further product integration. A cable
modem jointly developed with NetComm is scheduled to be available in
mid-1996.

CABLE ARRIVES AT TELECOM '95

As the divide between industry sectors becomes ever more blurred, the
cable fraternitynow participates in the encroaching telephony market -
including its four yearly extravaganza in Geneva, Telecom '95, held in
early in October.

Sponsored by the International Telecommunications Union, the show saw a
reputed $1 billion spent on stands by the 1,066 exhibitors, sprawled
over four exhibition floors, thronging with 189,671 participants - up
18 per cent on the 1991 event.

Larry Ellison, chairman and CEO or Oracle Corporation outlined his view
of the future - a fast network delivering everything to cheap set top
boxes. Under the company's plan, cable television would remain separate
from other devices such as computers and telephones but those devices
would be almost disposable.

 Network connected devices would download all the software and systems
needed to run direct from the network when switched on. The cable
providers couldchange systems often as the devices re-configure
themselves each time they are switched on. Set-top boxes being used by
BT in its interactive TV trials are the first examples of such
products.

Ellison suggests that "there is nothing less important than movies on
demand (MOD)" and he sees education, news on demand and commerce as far
more important, saying no cable company could justify building a new
network for Movies On Demand.

Ipitek Corporation was showing its new software system that allows
cable companies to make use of existing connections to satellite farms,
TV stations and other facilities by offering to route traffic between
them and charge for the service. Using new computer software in
conjunction with the California-based company's line up of Fibrehub and
Imtran Fibre Optic Transmission System units, the system offers more
flexibility and remote control of each point on the network from a
single PC.

ADC Telecommunications announced a development agreement with Nokia and
showed its line of Homeworx broadband access platforms (also see ADC
article this issue).

Ortel was receiving interntional interest for its linear optics
technology. The recently developed System-1000 unit allows operators to
take the complete frequency range from a satellite head end and send it
up to 40 km to the cable company. Ortel's Richard Mullikin, business
manager of satellite communications, said, "Ortel's System 1000 is
capable of accepting greater frequency ranges, it is cost-effective and
can be installed in a day."

Nortel launched Cogent at the show, an independent subsidiary of
Nortel, created to provide a complete consultancy for companies wishing
to build new networks or upgrade existing ones.

Brian Gowers, managing director of Cogent, explained the company would
supply its own personnel to initially come up with a network plan for
the desired system and, once agreed on, would offer contracts for
supply of the equipment.

Gowers stressed that it wasn't just a way to sell Nortel equipment,
pointing out that it chose Alcatel access equipment. He added tht none
of Nortel's competitors had refused to provide detailed technical
specifications for he bides and tht showed that they al recognised
Cogent as being independent.

As the system is built, Cogent supply key management personnel and will
take charge of hiring and training of employees in all areas of the
business from operation to sales.

The relationship built up with Cogent continues through to after-system
launch with Gowers adding, "We wouldn't want to exit less than 12
months after launch. Trying to step out too soon is a recipe to fall
over. It is a long term relationship."

The expo also saw the public debut of several new multimedia operating
systems. Sony unveiled its new system, Apertos, complete with a
futuristic looking set top box dubbed Pecchi, the Personal
Entertainment Computer and Communicator for Home Interaction.

Apertos offers a system on which operators can build complete
multimedia and video on demand services while the Pecchi box acts like
a traditional set top box as the interface between the network and in
home equipment which can now include a television set and radio tuner
plus computer or cable telephone.

Also competing was NEC Corporation which debuted a system that included
a broadband access network management system for fibre- to-the-curb and
fibre-to-the-building, and a service management system for VOD.

The ITU used the occasion to release its 250 page second World
Telecommunication Development Report on the state of telecoms around
the world. Among its main finding was that, internationally, the number
of new subscribers to cable television is continuing to rise.

In 1994 14.5 million cable subscribers were added, exceeding the 13.7
million rise in 1993. According to the ITU figures, almost 173 million
homes world-wide are now cabled including 76 million in the USA, 57
million in Asia and 38 million in Europe.

INTEGRATION ON TRIAL

Annual revenues for telephony via cable are now #330 million in the UK,
and forecast to exceed #1 billion by the year 2000, but this success
relies heavily on the capital needed to build the system. Previously
operators had to install an entirely separate network for
telecommunications, but integrated cable telephony (RF to the
Kerb/Home) based on transmission of the telephony signals within the
existing network lets the telephony system share the duct, street
cabinets, power and cabling of broadcast services.

Hughes Network Systems has tested its own integrated cable telephony
system, called Cable Telephony Transport System (CTTS), in an
operational environment.

Details are confidential but results are positive. CTTS has performed
well, delivering a reliable telephony service over the HFC network.
Telephony via an HFC network depends on two key subsystems. It
comprises a head end unit installed at or close to the catv head end,
and a number of remote nodes. Each remote node contains at least one
remote interface unit and primary multiplexer and servicing at least 30
subscribers. Concentration can be added to increase the number of lines
carried over the network. At the head end, traffic is presented as EI
(or TI) streams for direct connection, or via further transmission
links, to an exchange switch.

A cross connect facility in the headend enables grooming and
consolidation of traffic carried over the network. A network manager
provides configuration control and status and alarm monitoring. The
remote node is co-located with the catv equipment, usually sited in a
street side cabinet or in the utility room of an appartment. The home
link is made by copper pair to a standard telephone outlet eliminating
installation of equipment in the home.

Alternatively, diplexers can be used to add the telephony signal to the
coaxial drop cable so that no additional wiring is needed. This allows
some 30 to 60 homes to be served by a single remote node. By using
common circuitry the cost is shared over several lines, as opposed to
'RF to the home' where each telephone line has its own dedicated
equipment. RF to the kerb suits medium to high penetration areas
whereas 'RF to the home' is best used where penetration remains low.
Upgrade of the service, adding customers and maintenance, are simple
and quick, virtually eliminating home visits.

System power and backup is controlled by the operator. The system is
also very secure. Only signals designated for a given customer are
delivered to the premises so one customer cannot assume the identity of
another. For the business user, a range of line card types can be
fitted to the PMUX to provide ISDN and other data services. Also the
RIU can be used directly (without the PMUX) to provide 2048kbt/s
service.

And the system provides the infrastructure for interactive services in
the future. With the Hughes system, utilisation of bandwidth is very
efficient and can be configured for either narrow or broadband
services. Later cable modems will offer high performance ethernet over
the cable network providing high speed data communications plus
entertainment services, Internet and general on-line information.

TELLABS DEMONSTRATES REMOTE SERVICE UNIT

Tellabs demonstrated its new single-residence remote service unit (RSU)
for its Cablespan 2300 cable telephony system at ECC '95, delivering
integrated cable television and telephony services over standard
coaxial cable to the subscriber.

Single and multiline versions are available with the initial release
supporting basic telephone services for homes and small business
applications.

Compact design, low power consumption, remote provisioning to speed up
installation and service turn-up, extensive fault locator diagnostics
and ability to accommodate future network services such as ISDN and Lan
to the home are incorporated in the system which is designed to be
fully compatible with international catv and telecom networks.

The RSU enables the Cablespan system to service single home, apartment
block and business catv hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) applications. A key
function of the Cablespan 2300 system is in transforming broadcast CATV
only HFC networks into fully interactive telecommunications networks.

Tellabs Cablespan 2300 telephony over cable system with the RSU is
being used by Viacom Cable to deliver a residential telephone service
over catv for a 200 home trial in Castro Valley, San Francisco, running
from January to June 1996. Integrated catv and telephony including
direct dial local and long distance calling, custom calling and
operator assisted services will be included, and the system can deliver
voice and data services, seamlessly upgrading the existing cable TV
network. Time Warner Communications, Adelphia, Time Warner
Entertainment/Advanced Newhouse and Telewest are also evaluating
Cablespan for cable telephony.

PERSONAL SERVICE SOUGHT

In this fast moving industry, cable operators cannot presume to compete
with the telcos on price alone, so what is available for the cable
operators to enable them to maintain their penetration of the telephony
market? Tony Daniels reports

Telcos are readying themselves for an era of free bandwidth, and it
won't be long before free (or extremely cheap) calls become
commonplace. Even Arno Penzias, vice president of research at Bell
Labs, strikes a cautionary note, "AT&T Telcos should be terrified of
the prospect of free bandwidth. But the answer is change - and change
is coming." The strategy of the cable operators must be to move away
from marketing telephony offerings on price to a value-added service
basis.

UK cable operators offer savings on charges, itemised billing, and the
service advantages of a local network. Industry estimates put the
number of telephone exchange lines installed at 1.2 million, in over 50
regional franchise areas. This compares with 5.8 million broadband
homes passed (1.1 million subscribers), a telephony penetration rate of
20.7 per cent.

Goldman Sachs is a little more conservative, putting the expected
number of cable telephony subscribers by 2000 at 5.1 million (ie 15 per
cent).More value must be offered to meet forecast penetration by the
end of the decade.

The CCA expects cable telephony to increase from 1.3 million lines by
the end of 1995 to 5.7 million lines by the end of 2000, and a
corresponding increase in telephony penetration from 29 to 51 per cent,
with business cable telephony lines to rise from 8 to 12 per cent by
2000 - not much in terms of installed lines, but business-derived
revenue will be significantly higher. Centrex services could provide
small businesses with several advantages, giving callers the impression
of a much larger and efficient organisation. Key features include a
range of call transfer and forwarding options, including 'ring back
when free.'

Bell Cablemedia has taken a lead in developing innovative tariffing and
service packages including call waiting and call barring, with voice
mail following swiftly behind. BT subscribers can get all of these
services - and more besides, but BCM will soon be offering a dual-
number and dual-ringing tone service, so that users can differentiate
an incoming business call from a residential one.

Data is the obvious way that cable companies can capitalise, with fast
file transfer for business users and high-speed Internet connections
for homes. Motorola Multimedia has done significant work on cable
modems and BCM is working on its caller line identification (CLI)
service, including the manufacture of specially branded display
telephone sets. Hughes Network Systems is advocating an integrated
telephony over cable service, which offers full E1 (2Mbit/s) from the
head-end to the curb-side, as opposed to the traditional overlay
network. Telewest trialed the equipment, and has recommended that its
franchisees take up the system.

According to Richard Stevens, business development manager for cable at
Hughes Network Systems, "Telewest is holding back on the level of
deployment until they have more information; they are now testing their
own processes, which in turn will determine operational costs. "At the
head-end there is an E1 interface to the switch, and each networked
switch can support up to 20 remote curb-side nodes, again connected by
E1 lines to a mux card in the cabinet. Such systems enable cable
operators to deliver high speed data, such as file transfer or Internet
access, to the SoHo and residential markets. Although according to
Stevens, "We are likely to see such applications happening in the US
first, with some roll-out in 1996, but real roll-out will not be until
1997."

Personal numbering is still a few years away and subject to regulatory
clearance, but Ericsson is promoting its 'universal personal
telecommunications' service, which is a value-added feature of its
intelligent network switches. The service gives a subscriber a single
number, which he then uses for home, business and mobile purposes.

What is in effect a 'virtual' personal numbering system is available
today from TPS of the UK. Its Personal Assistant value added system
integrates different services, media and equipment under a single
personal number. Subscribers can consolidate their work, home and
mobile phone and fax numbers on one number, managing incoming and
outgoing calls to their own requirements.

It also offers 'find me' call completion, caller screening, fully
featured voicemail, fax store and forward, 'cardless' phone card, and
SMS support. The system knows where you are and when you are available,
and will announce calls so that they can be screened. At any time
during a call, the subscriber can transfer the caller to the voice-mail
service, to be acted upon at a more convenient time. The service is
available to telephony operators as either a service bureau
implementation or a full system sale.

US PREPARES FOR DIGITAL FUTURE

In the face of competition from DBS and DTH satellite services and
impending competition from telcos, North American cable companies now
view digital video compression as a necessity rather than a luxury.

North American viewers only watch 12 to 14 channels but the increased
bandwidth is needed to provide the 'information highway' services and
convergence services that telcos also plan to offer. Rich D'Amato chief
spokesman for the US National Cable Television Association expects
incremental investment of, "About $25 billion (#16 billion) over the
next five to six years to enable cable plant to provide both telephony
and robust video or online services."

Finance is sought for the new services, but the cablecos must be
competitive telecommunications providers, so they are demanding a level
playing field to compete with the telcos. Some states currently allow
cablecos into local telephony and some do not, but there is a
telecommunications bill now in Congress. For two years the spectre of
DBS hitting cable profits has gnawed away at cable's ability to raise
capital. The American cable industry has revenues of $23 billion
yearly, compared to the telcos' $100 billion, so unequal competition
would allow the telcos to swamp cable with their financial clout. Rate
caps were put on US cable prices in 1992.

"Should the legislation be passed,' says D'Amato, you will see cable
operators plan to get into telephony and investment in technologies to
increase capacity and signal quality. Remove regulatory uncertainties
and the bankers will lend money."

The proposed deregulation lifts the rate caps imposed in 1992,
overrides state legislatures and provides for competitive cross-entry.
The White House is not pleased with the thought of lifting cable rate
caps, but wouldn't veto it if it was well supported. It may be passed
this session or held until next year.

Increased capacity is sought by US cablecos to offer consumers a bundle
of services including video, telephony, online access and interactive
services.

"We telephony see as part of our future, carrying us into a leadership
position in telecommunications. It will include video services,
interactivity and access to home banking, shopping, energy management -
the services required from a full service telecommunications provider,"
says D'Amato. "Cable and telephone companies will be offering very
similar services."

Digital video compression will be introduced in 1996, meantime channel
capacity is being increased through fibre deployment. "Channel capacity
and system rebuilds come down to the deployment of fibre and the
addition of digital boxes. Digital boxes come down to manufacturers
producing them in sufficient quantities at affordable prices," says
D'Amato.

TeleCommunications Inc (TCI) is introducing compression on a market by
market basis in mid1996, but other major cable operators are holding
back. Time Warner Cable and Continental Cablevision have adopted a
'wait and see' strategy.

"Digitisation is unquestionably an important trend," says Time Warner
Cable spokesman Mike Luftman. "But we don't have any plans to take any
of our cable systems digital in the near term. Our Orlando Service
Network finds out what digital services people want and we use our
upgraded networks to introduce more analogue cable services, local
telephony and online computer services now. Ultimately a great deal of
TV is going to be digital but we are increasing our analogue capacity
through fibre rebuilds first."

Luftman says that close to 50 per cent or Time Warner, (TW) systems
have been fibred and more than 90 per cent will have been rebuilt by
the year 2000. He points out that while rebuilding with fibre is cost
efficient in urban and suburban areas, smaller operators in rural areas
will probably opt for the introduction of DVC with minimal fibre. "Some
systems in rural areas don't see the payback in fibre rebuilds. For
them digitisation is more important because it will allow them to
deliver more channels in the near future and it is a cost efficient way
to get channel capacity without rebuilding their systems."

For TW, the prospect of bundling services is important. "People will be
presented with at least two choices of providers of bundled services
and being in the market first is a substantial advantage.

"There's no question that cable will get there first because of the
nature our networks" says Luftman. He sees deregulation as providing
opportunities, rather than easing a credit crunch. "We don't have a
capital problem. Deregulation is important because we need access to
telephony through deregulation to gain a fair and competitive playing
field. Telephony is very important. Once you have these upgraded
networks you have this tremendous opportunity. It would be
irresponsible not to take advantage of the opportunity that local
telephone offers. If telephone is going to compete in television then
it is important to get up and compete in their business as soon as
possible."

David Fellows, Continental Cablevision's vice president of technology
and engineering sees it differently, "We are the only major MSO which
has not placed orders for DVC set tops. I want to be within six months
of a real delivery date, to be able to look at a box and kick it and
know what the price is before signing. We will be rolling out digital
compression with the rest, but at the moment we view that as a high end
tier, ten per cent of our customers."

Continental is waiting for the price to come down before going digital.
"Digital boxes seem to be north of $400 for just a decompression box,
not an Orlando full service interactive box. And for $400 I don't think
adding a hundred channels as opposed to 20, is going to pay for them."

Instead, Continental plans to introduce advanced analogue boxes which
permit the use of a virtual channel which can act as an advanced
program guide or a weather or traffic channel.

Through its participation in Primestar, the cable consortium DTH
operator, Continental has concluded that you don't need hundreds of
channels. "We are doing more market testing, but it appears if you have
just ten different movies on with start times every hour, that's good
enough. You don't have to go to start times of every five minutes and a
library of ten thousand titles to get enough revenue to pay for an
analogue box," says Fellows.

Continental is launching an IP0 and applying to various states for
alternative local telephony provider status. 'The pre-emption of state
law by a federal bill would make explaining our plans to analysts
simpler, then we would have to go through a state by state plan.

In Canada deregulation will not finally arrive until local rates are
rebalanced to make local telephony profitable. Long distance charges
curently subsidise local rates. Until the technology arrives and is
installed to permit interconnectivity and number portability, telcos
and cable companies will not be allowed into each other's businesses.

Financial analysts warned the market to avoid Canadian cable operators
due to the threat of DBS and telco competition, but this hasn't
thwarted their ability to raise capital. Colin Watson, president of
Rogers Cablesystems Ltd, Canada's largest MSO says, "The capital market
is certainly adequate. We have managed financings in the US and expect
to continue to do that. There is a lot of regulatory uncertainty on the
issue of cable and telephone competition which I believe has
destabilised the financial markets but it doesn't do anything to the
fundamentals. The informed investor is very enthusiastic about cable."

Rogers has ordered digital set top boxes from General Instrument and
plans to start rolling them out in the third quarter of 1996. Rogers
plans to continue rebuilding its networks until it reaches 625MHz which
is effectively the coming North American standard, providing 90
channels. It plans to use 70 channels for analogue services and 20
channels for DVC at a ratio of 12 to 1, eventually giving it 240
digital channels.

Shaw, Canada's second largest MSO, is building out its systems until
they reach 550MHz. It is in negotiations for digital set top boxes and
plans to start introducing compression in mid-1996.

Rogers' Colin Watson is optimistic. about the potential effect of
digital services on revenue, "There is a relatively flat growth in
traditional cable company revenues but there will be tremendous growth
in revenues from highspeed access for computers and, subsequently,
telephone revenues. Within 10 years new services will provide 50 per
cent of our revenue and that's conservative. "

Michael D'Avella, Shaw's senior vice-president for planning predicts,
"In five years from now new services will provide 30 to40 per cent of
revenues."

Telephony is seen as a 'must have' to compete in the one stop shopping
market beyond 2000, but most American MSOs believe that immediate
growth will come from providing access to online services with
superfast cable modems.

"We already have high speed access in New England and next year we will
start selling the service. Nobody else does it at the speeds we can
offer so you aren't taking a telephone customer and trying to explain
why your dial tone sounds better," says Continental's Fellows.

"Adding in enhanced PPV and revenue from digital services, I think that
in five years, new services might provide 50-60 per cent of revenue,"
says Fellows

He believes these services will migrate from the PC to the TV. "The
companies we are talking to are aimed at the computer and I believe
compelling interactive services will emerge from the PC arena and cut
their teeth there, then versions will be transferred to TV. For home
banking you want a keyboard in front of you."

For many MSOs, digitisation means satellite-proofing. "It means we can
have a service that is much better than any satellite offering," says
Watson, "We will have many many many more channels of PPV, a fully
digitised spectrum and all the local channels."

Cable telephony means increased revenues, but more importantly it lets
cablecos to compete with the telcos as they enter video. Online
services seem poised as cable's great potential in the US. High speed
access is a service cablecos can provide now. "We believe the growth in
PCs and the absolutely astounding interest in gaining access to the
World Wide Web and Internet are the next bonanza in terms of growth
opportunities," says Michael D'Avella.

TIGERS PROWL THE CATV MARKET

Taiwan, one of East Asia's foremost tiger economies, has seen a
plethora of electronics manufacturers enter the cable television
market, supplying many of the oft-overlooked components that keep a
system running. And the government's emphasis on promoting its high
tech industries mean that Taiwan is not just a low cost 'clone product'
maker, but is increasingly conducting its own research and development.

One manufactuerer with a 25 year track record is Trans Electric which
specialises in catv/smatv systems. Its annual sales of over 10,000 catv
headend modulators make the company the dominant Asian supplier. Trans
Electric's PX set top converter is used by half the domestic market and
internationally it has seen sales of over 3.5 million sets.

The company has its own catv technology centre and laboratory in
Taiwan, the first in the country, supporting its research and
development and quality control as well as providing a support and
service centre for its customers. Trans Electric is also the sales
distributor for Philips Magnavox catv distribution products and the
licensed manufacturer of the Zenith addressable scrambling system.

The company portfolio comprises headend equipment; distribution
equipment and subscriber equipment.

Lead Universal International Corporation, with its Chainford
Electronics Company factory, manufactures a broad range of catv parts
and accessories including both passive and active products ranging from
outdoor trunk amplifiers and line extenders to indoor splitters.

Exemplifying the Taiwanese approach to high levels of customer service,
Manager Kennex Huang says, "Our thirteen years in this field have
enabled us to provide high performance reliable equipment with
competitive pricing. We are also competitive on service, with a quick
delivery time of three weeks after receiving payment. Our recently
developed 750 MHz amplifier will be entering production in 1996." The
company produes various types of amplifiers, line extenders, power
inserters/combiners, line splitters, couplers, directional taps, power
supplies and catv connectors.

There are also many tightly focused companies in the market such as
Ding Yih Industrial Co which manufactures catv coaxial cable connectors
and RF coaxial cable connectors suitable for a wide range of cable
types and sizes.

Jack Chang, CEO at Favorlangh Communication Consulting Inc explained
that his company, "Provides specialised market research on retainer or
on a project by project basis,drafting franchise proposals and
evaluating opportunities."

GIVE 'EM A WINCH

Dramatic growth in the installation of fibre optic cable above and
below ground and sub-sea is pushing technological developments with new
products and techniques

In the UK companies such as Energis and Eastern Electricity have been
installing overhead fibre optic cables - ADSS (all dielectric self
supporting cables); OPGW (optical path ground wire) and WRAP (fibre
optic cable wrapped around the earth on transmission towers). CBS
Products noted that most of the existing stringing winches did not have
the necessary tension control required by fibre cables. It designed
tensioners to provide controlled braking via hydraulic variable
controls, and secondary braking through the use of hydraulic disc
brakes.

In any stringing operation a cable pulling bond or rope is first
installed along with running out blocks.

Fibre optic cable installation lengths are long to reduce splicing
which is costly and increases signal loss, but this results in the need
for a fibre puller able to take 5 km of rope. The pullers and tensioner
also need to be versatile to cope with arduous environments.

CBS supplies a range of solutions to meet these demands; trailer
mounted machines with high ground clearance for towing behind all
terrain vehicles to light weight machines that can be manually
transported in inaccessible site locations.

Underground fibre cables are usually installed manually with pulling of
cable by hand, whereas copper communications cables are installed using
small diameter (150 mm) capstan winches that provide large tension
capacities (4000 kg); these winches are then used to pull fibre cables
that require tensions as low as 200 kg.

To protect the cables from over tensioning, a simple fused swivel is
employed by CBS, rated for the maximum allowable cable load. If the
fused swivel breaks mid pull, the ends of the swivel need to be located
and retrieved. The two ends then need to be reconnected before the pull
can recommence. Also, the draw rope is usually left on the ground.

CBS' new winch has integral hydraulic load monitoring pre-set for the
level of pull at which the torque is relieved from the capstan's
hydraulic motor to stop the pull. Tension remains in the cable due to
the number of wraps of draw rope around the capstan. The winch has a
removable rope-take drum. A large diameter (760 mm) capstan allows
greater lengths of installation cable to be wrapped around, allowing a
second winch to assist the pulling winch.

Mid-point pulls, or pulls that have severe changes in direction require
cable figure eighting to ensure the cable does not kink or snag. CBS
has introduced its C-1050 cable fleeters with mid-assist winching,
currently being used in the UK and Malaysia to overcome problems
associated with figure eighting which usually takes up large areas of
pavement, roads, or motorway hard shoulder.

At mid point there is no loose end, so the cable taken off the drum is
looped through a hydraulic cable feeder which takes cable into a
detachable drum at a rate of 100 m per minute, hence it can move 2 km
of cable in 20 minutes.

CUSTOMER DATABASES ALL MAPPED OUT

In Britain Ordnance Survey large scale maps have been essential tools
of the construction sector for more than a century thanks to their
level of detail.

Developments in cost effective GIS and CAD systems generated a national
demand for data that allowed the Ordnance Survey to accelerate its
programme of converting large scale maps to a digital form. Helped by
utility sector customers, the vast task was completed in April 1995.

OS can now produce site centred Superplan plots, the OS's replacement
for traditional large scale maps. Each Superplan Plotting System is
connected via ISDN link to the OS's main database offering on-demand
access to the latest mapping of any part of Great Britain.

A new large scale digital map data product used throughout the cable
and construction industries is OS's Land-Line, used by most local
authorities instead of conventional paper mapping. Land-Line data is
not just used as a screen image, but is increasingly manipulated and
merged with other datasets such as cable or service networks. The
number of plots now being produced for use as working documents or
archive copies means that the volume of mapping in use is increasing
rather than decreasing.

When Land-Line is used with suitable GIS software, linked to one or
more databases, the resulting spatial-data asset management system can
be an efficient way of dealing with large amounts of constantly
changing information.

OS's Address point is another data product suitable for use by the
cable industry, providing a geographical reference for each postal
address in Great Britain. Frequently liked with Land-line, it is
reported to be proving an effective way of geo-referencing a customer
database for purposes as varied as marketing and network growth
planning and fault identification.

Accurate up-to-date data using quality datasets enables efficient and
economic development of existing and potential customer databases.

ENCLOSURES MEET HIGHER SPECIFICATIONS

Six new enclosures were launched by Malcoe at this year's ECC show,
built using Malcolite, a structural foam/aluminium composite, for each
body panel. These light-weight panels are further reinforced by a load
bearing cage incorporated into the panels during manufacture. Benefits
include enhanced physical security, noise insulation, and enhanced
thermal properties. Integrated doors leave a near seamless outline not
cluttered with locks, hinges or flanges. Cable entry can be top or
bottom, and the cabinets are rated to IP*6. The Cablestation
accommodates fibre, cable, cellular and microwave technologies, with
all around access to electronic equipment via front or rear doors.
Internal surfaces including doors can incorporate a slim-line heat
exchanger. Sealed equipment chambers prevent water, dust and pollution
ingress.

Also in the company's product range are: the Norfolk radio base station
with extensive anti-vandal features, sealed thermal chamber, heat
exchanger and removable acoustic cowl; the Leicester accommodates
fibre, copper and coax, suitable for joint Telecoms/catv systems, with
powerful cooling and ventilation systems, and removable thermal
chamber; the Stirling 'cost effective' model has a fixed double skin
for thermal management; and the Hallmark describes a method of
manufacture rather than an actual product, offering a stainless steel
enclosure.

Malcoe's new Telecoms division offers design, configuration and testing
services from enclose selection to site fitting.

FLAG

Work has begun on cable laying for the Fibre Optic Link Around the
Globe (FLAG) - at 27,000 km, the world's longest fibre optic
communications cable, scheduled to run from Europe to the Far East with
landing points in the UK, Spain, Italy, Egypt, the UAE, India,
Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, China, Korea and Japan.

Bandwidth transmission capacity will be up to 120,000 digital circuits
at 64/kb/sec, using two fibre pairs each operating at 5 gigabits per
second, and more than 40 carriers have already agreed to purchase
capacity.

Nynex Network Systems is the managing sponsor of FLAG, heading a
consortium of investors from the US, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and
Thailand putting up $1.5 billion capital for the project.

The cable system is being built by AT&T Submarine Systems Inc, and KDD
Submarine Cable Systems of Japan, and is scheduled to go into service
in October 1997.

The cable runs underwater for 26,000 km, linking with existing Pacific
and Atlantic fibre optic cables to span the globe. Primarily intended
for telephony and data, it will also form a faster alternative route to
satellite for video used in special circumstances, allowing live
transcontinental broadcasts to virtually loose their time delay.

STEEL GETS HOT, HOT, HOT

Broadband outside plant managers need to ensure that they specify
enclosures which minimise temperature to reduce chip failure rates says
George Sell, market research and product development at Channell
Commercial Corporation

Heat does affect the performance and reliability of RF amplifiers, but
while amplifier manufacturers have set operating temperature range
specifications, included heat sink features, and provided warranties
covering initial performance, they don't cover heat damage, reliability
and failure rates, and performance over the life of the amplifier
product.

Broadband telecommunications customers assume the life expectancy of RF
amplifiers is longer than the warranty period (typically three years)
with reliability throughout its life. But manufacturers have not
addressed these issues because their customers have not raised them.

Enclosure manufacturers pay lip service to heat dissipation but provide
little evidence for their claims. The operating temperatures of 40oC to
+60oC sets low and high temperature operating extremes, and, short-term
warranties deal with the occasional 'infant mortality' of products
deployed. But these provisions do not address the impact of temperature
on the long-term reliability of RF amplifiers. Neither specifications
(nor warranty coverages) address failure rates over the life of the
product, nor project a life expectancy for the products.

Heat impact on operating performance and life of amplifiers needs to be
measured and here users can turn to extensive testing by the US
Department of Defense (DoD) on integrated circuit performance relative
to heat impacts. The US DoD document MIL-HDBK-217 (MIL-SPECS) provides
a measure of heat impacts on component integrated circuit (IC) chip
failure rates.

MIL-HDBK-217 states that the transistor failure rate doubles for every
9oC (16.2oF) increase in die temperature. This applies at any
temperature and is not a range of threshold. Therefore, the cooler the
operating temperature maintained, the lower the failure rate over the
life of the component IC chips in the RF amplifier. Consequently,
broadband outside plant designer should specify enclosures that best
quantifiably maintain the lowest operating temperatures for the RF
amplifiers they house.

Previous relevant tests include those by broadband system engineers in
Sacramento, California, 1988; enclosure and amplifier product tests
conducted by Channell Commercial Corporation in Temecula, California,
1990; and proprietary field tests of new high frequency amplifier
products conducted by an amplifier manufacturer in Sunnyvale,
California, 1993, employing metal and thermoplastic enclosures.

The Sacramento tests were conducted by the local cable television
system to help decide between Reliable's (now Reltec) traditional metal
enclosures or Channell Commercial's thermoplastic enclosures. Superior
heat dissipation was the criterion.

Test results at the extreme ambient temperature of 38.3oC (101oF)
indicated the coolest reading on the IC chip as 60.6oC (141 oF). or
4.4oC (40oF) over ambient using the Channell CPH1730/500. At the low
temperature extreme of 11.1oC (52oF) ambient, Channell's had the best
showing for IC chip temperature at 37.8oC (100oF), or 8.9oC (48oF) over
ambient. Reliable's had 24.4oC (76oF) over ambient, or 53.3oC (128oF).

In both termperature extremes there was a consistent difference in
temperature on the IC chip, between the results for the Reliable and
Channell enclosures, an increment of about 15.5oC (28oF), with the
Channell enclosure having the best results.

Applying the MIL-HDBK-217 figures, that would mean deploying an RF
amplifier in the Reliable TV-1832/A would increase the predictable
failure rate for the IC chips by nearly three and a half times over the
same amplifier mounted in Channell Commercial's CPH1730/500. And this
differential factor will likely hold true at any temperature within the
specified operating range.

Testing by Channell Commercial in Temecula, California, in 1990 covered
22 different production models of enclosures from four leading
manufacturers and various amplifier models from three leading
manufacturers to gather temperature data on amplifiers, but comparative
data on enclosure heat dissipation was also collected.

The amplifiers tested were: Magnavox 450MHz and 550MHz trunk
amplifiers, 450 MHz and 550MHz line extenders; Scientific Atlanta
450MHz and 550MHz trunk amplifiers, 450 MHz and 550MHz line extenders;
Jettold 450 MHz and 550 MHz trunk amplifiers, 450 line extenders.

The enclosure models included in the tests were: Pyramid 1S30.;Moped;
Reliable TV-104, TV-106, TV-1024, TV-1228, TV-1832 and Channell
Commercial CPH1230/STD, CPH1230/500, CHP1730/5TD, CPH1730/500. Data was
recorded by sensors at four locations inside each enclosure's covers
and amplifiers.

Data was collected at thirty minute intervals, twenty-four hours per
day over 30 days. The test data is proprietary but it showed the
superiority of the Channell Commercial enclosure products in terms of
amplifier heat dissipation, especially the 1230 and 1730 units with the
series 500 heat dissipation covers.

The results of the proprietary field tests of new high frequency
amplifier products by a major manufacturer in Sunnyvale, California, in
1993, remain proprietary, however, the test data confirms the data from
the two earlier tests.

Channell thermoplastic enclosures achieve high performance through
their wall thicknesses, louvering, and type and quality of materials
used in their manufacture. And, special heat dissipating covers enhance
performance in severe sun loading conditions. RF amplifier
manufacturers strive for higher frequencies and wider bandwidths,
making the effect of heat dissipation and heat rise on electronics ever
more critical. Amplifiers nominally generate 50 W of heat dissipation,
but worse case parameters easily exceed 100 W.

Field tests show that above 36.7oC (98oF), the heat dissipation
characteristics of Channell Commercial enclosures diverge from the
norm. Other enclosures, especially metal units, track linearly with
increases in ambient temperature, while Channell's track more
positively toward a cooler scale of temperature on the IC Chip. Even if
all other design factors were equal, such as vents and louvers,
attention to convection principles, heat sinking metal bracketry for
amplifier mounting, the amount of free air surrounding the mounted
amplifier etc, the difference between the materials used for
manufacturing enclosures would still be significant. For heat
dissipation, thermoplastic enclosures out-perform metal enclosures.

HDPE MAKES DUCT 'VIRTUALLY INDISTRUCTIBLE'

Behind the glamour world of breaking news and sports finals lies the
ducting that actually carries cable, bringing programmes to viewers
homes.

Priorities here are durablility and ease - hence cost - of
installation. Ducting designed specifically for the catv and
telecommunications industries is supplied by Dura-line who's HDPE Main
Duct System is a total duct solution comprising durable product with
high impact resistance and tensile strength to simplify installation.
It can be buried directly using conventional civils techniques, or
ploughed straight into the ground, even at sub-zero temperatures
without duct shattering; it is also flexible enough to substantially
reduce the need for angled bends.

The company's Silicore Sub Duct comprises a virtually indestructible
HDPE outer with co-extruded permanent lubrication producing an
extremely low coefficient of friction to ensure that even under high
pulling loads, cable and ropes do not burn through the sub duct's walls
and it does not deteriorate or diminish with age. Coil set is totally
eliminated during coiling manufacture when the memory is set in a
permanent straight line - so the sub duct does not coil or corkscrew
when pulled from the drum.

Last year the company opened a manufacturing facility in the UK to
handle the UK demand for main duct and sub-duct products. Advanced
engineering features included in the product range are printing,
striping and colour coding. Other products in the company's portfolio
include customer feeds, speciality duct for fibre optic, underground
chambers, slot boxes, cable pulling lubricants and a range of cable
pulling and sub duct accessories.

Dura-line has recently appointed Cliff Moss, formerly of IBM, as its
managing director.

KNOCK, KNOCK

Mike Shuff interviews a former cable salesman who tells of his
experiences

MS. When did you begin door-to-door cable selling?

Dave. I started in 1993. I was put on a training course, and, by the
end, I was more or less convinced that the company knew what it was
talking about. But, after a few weeks of door knocking, I knew the real
story.

MS. What was the training course like?

Dave. The course ran over five days, We went through everything from
product knowledge to 'dealing with people'; that is, what to say. You
were told to do this and that, but when you actually faced these
situations things turned out different.

MS. What were you told to say to prospective customers?

Dave. We were told that it was going to be a soft sell, hand delivering
glossy literature and then knocking on the door. In some areas, even
the literature drops had not been done. First I had to 're-market' to
areas where most people had already declined the service, so it was
difficult to sell there. In the end, I was mainly selling the phone.

MS. Was the telephone service widely available then?

Dave. No, not in all areas. It was very annoying when you were given a
good sales lead... a prospective customer who had phoned or written
requesting information. The fact that the service was not available
meant that the call was a waste of my selling time.

MS. You were a 'Cable Advisor,' how did you sell?

Dave. Yes. The term 'salesman' was not used. In fact, we were sent to
close the deal. I was told that I should spend no more than 20 minutes
tops on any sales visit before closing. If I was selling the telephone
service, I would knock at the door and come out with something
guaranteed to get attention. "Hello! Do you know the advantages of
being on cable telephone? You only pay for the exact amount of time the
call takes... so you can really save money. Would you like me to go
through your phone bill for you, to show you were you could be saving
money?" which worked better than saying, "I've come to talk about the
benefits of cable." I was never told how it would save money, I just
read the literature.

MS. Who did you approach?

Dave. Generally it was the male owner of the house. On one or two
occasions, I thought that I had closed, only to find I had lost it
because the woman had not been involved.

MS. So its a family decision?

Dave. Yes. The children were also influential, very keen on cable
television because it's new and they can get lots of channels. They can
brag at school "Did you see so and so on cable last night?"; especially
to the kids in their class who don't yet have it.

MS. When were the best times to call?

Dave. We usually called between 6 and 8 o'clock pm. It was difficult to
get both husband and wife together at that time as wives were usually
busy with the domestic routine around dinner. This wasn't recognised by
the compay. They assumed that everybody was at home at this time;
therefore, that was the best time to sell.

MS. Were you encouraged to work outside the set hours?

Dave. Yes. I was working seven days a week. I didn't like working on
Sunday so I would use this day for pre-arranged appointments only, but
plenty of cable advisors were working longer hours, and signing up
exactly the same number of customers.

MS. What was the problem?

Dave. What you've got to accept is, there is no point in calling on
people who genuinely don't want the service. We were just given areas.
You knew almost straight away whether you had got a good area for sales
or a bad, dried-up one. There were certain areas that you knew you were
going to sell very well. A new run in a better quality council estate
was bound to provide a good crop of cable connections, These customers
wanted exactly what cable could offer immediately. Lots of sport, more
channels. films so that they didn't have to rent videos from the shops.
Better off areas simply didn't want catv - they had plenty of other
things to do and were only interested in cheaper telephone services.

MS. Who was interested?

Dave. People who had asked the company for information were generally
professional types wanting to slash large telephone bills. But the
telephone service wasn't always available which prevented me closing
the deal. One time I had sold the whole of a block, but nobody could be
connected because the people who put in the ducts had installed the
wrong type. I got fed-up making excuses for the company.

MS. What was the biggest fault in the marketing plan?

Dave. They did not listen to the actual customers, and tailor cable
services to their needs. Advertising is essential. I would open a
freephone number for anyone wanting to know more about cable. I would
advertise in local newspapers and on the local TV.

MS. What is the average 'life expectancy' of a salesman and how are
they paid?

Dave. Selling life is short. They burn you out. Normally you last
between three and six months. There was a small basic pay, then
commission. In theory, you could earn a lot of money. But salesmen fell
out with their supervisors and were out of a job. I have yet to receive
commission owed.

VOD - DELIVERED

Effective management and analysis of data, whether for programme or
system networks, billing, marketing subscriptions or general finance,
needs dedicated powerfulsoftware applications - and programs for the
catv industry are increasingly available

Wiztec Solutions of Israel has introduced Video on Demand, and plans to
incorporate telephony capability next year in its multilingual cable
subscriber management and billing System (SMS) Wizard.

Wiztek was formed in January from Digital Equipment Company's sale of
its subsidiary DECSys. Its Wizard system includes a complete cable and
satellite TV Infomanagement system for RdB and Oracle databases, and
additional databases in the new year.

Svenka Kezurer of Wiztec adds, "We have also looked at industry video
servers and developed APIs to support a variety of different servers
and any new entrants."

The company already provides Video on Demand billing facilities and is
currently running a pilot billing and customer service scheme for an
interactive games channel. It also plans to be involved in interactive
services. Kezurer explained, "We provide the interface at the entry
point where a customer who wants to use an interactive service first
needs to get authorisation fro the Wiztec database. Afterwards the
systems again interface with the Wiztec system which will provide all
the information on what exactly was provided, how much data was used or
downloaded, and for how long - which would allow charging for Internet
usage on duration used or data transferred. We can set up all kinds of
software to charge according to different services offered and their
different rates."

Kezurer added, "We recognise that telephony is a must in the UK today,
and will provide this capability by the end of next year, aiming at
cable companies providing telephony as a new service."

The company says its flexible approach to tailoring pricing proposals
and payment terms is more adaptable to the diverse norms of the
international market.

Flexibility and openness of the product itself allows the core system
to adapt to growing demands, simplifying maintenance. A $2 million
order for Wizard SMS system software and services for Singapore Cable
Vision (SCV), delivered and running by May 1st after a mid-February
authorisation, is cited as exemplifying Wiztec's flexibility and
ability to stand by a commitment. Randall Coieman, president of SCV
said that the $500 million 30 TV channel and interactive multimedia
services operation chose Wizard for its rich functionality, high level
of support and flexibility of tailoring to requirements.

A Wizard system installed at Telkabel in Austria will enable the
company to offer its 420,000 subscriber base enhanced Pay TV options as
well as PPV and VOD.

REAL-TIME DECISIONS

Cable companies increasingly require real-time information to track
market influencing news stories as they break.

International deregulation is resulting in rapid expansion of cable and
companies with real-time news feeds are best able to capitalise on
emerging opportunities for strategic alliances, mergers and
acquisitions and new services. Real-time data is also used to
streamline company management systems. Tenfore's financial information
service is often integrated with existing software packages. Access to
real-time data such as news stories, foreign exchange rates and stock
market prices allows a quick response to market changes and is
gradually replacing traditional information intermediaries. By setting
specific filters on international news feeds, users are informed of
significant market influencing stories as they break, with time to
digest and act upon them rather than still trawling through the press
cuttings.

Short and medium term cash management can be enhanced by using real-
time financial data on deposit, interbank and forward rates. The
Tenfore system also helps with hedging foreign exchange risk. Forex and
forward prices can be viewed on the PC screen, in a chart or in a
'live' spreadsheet. Tenfore's software allows real-time tracking of
market movements. Global prices can be displayed and real-time ticker
graphs track 'bid', 'ask', 'last trade' or 'volume' according to
requirements.

Users can view real-time and historic data on shares, forex or indices
to present in graphs, spreadsheets or company reports, updatedable in
real-time.

Tenfore subscribers get free use of software for analysing data;
compatibility with other software programmes enables ease of
integration. Live data can be pasted into other Windows compatible
programmes like Exel and Word, updated in real-time.

OPEN SYSTEMS - UP TO A POINT

Information exchange between catv and telco systems, not integration,
is needed says Barco whose Rosa system intefaces with telecom mangement
systems

Minimising downtime and network redundancy are two of the most
important considerations in tele-communications, whereas catv has been
driven by the number of channels, not their quality or availability.
'How else could a customer get all of these programs ?'

But DTH satellites now offer an alternative, while digital DTH and new
high pay interactive services will demand optimum network reliability.
So cable companies must provide an attractive package of programs, plus
services not available via satellite, of excellent quality, and
availability comparable to telephony. Operators have to dramatically
improve their network reliability and quality.

Pre-convergence, Barco developed a catv management concept,
establishing standards for communication between equipment, developing
a propriety protocol supporting communication via normal PSTN lines.

Full Service Networks are now demanded with integration of catv into
Telecom Network Management systems a priority.

The Telecom industry has long been highly regulated with widespread
standard protocols and interfaces for communication between different
systems. Hence adapttation of management concepts with open standard
interfaces to higher level management systems is needed with full
client server architectures, ideally able to interface with non-
proprietary products.

But it does not seem relevant, or economical, to completely integrate
telco and catv systems. More appropriate and feasible is sufficient
integration for information and tasks to be exchanged from one system
to the other. A first step is in-depth monitoring of the headend and
network. This provides the operator with the information required to
respond quickly and efficiently to problems before they are noticed by
the subscriber.

Secondly, backup and rerouting systems need to be established to
increase the network's overall Mean Time Between Failures. Finally,
links to existing Network Management systems and Subscriber Management
systems need to be established to provide accurate management
information and information to customer support for proactive responce
to incoming calls.

Analysing how many people telcos need per 1000 subscribers to obtain
the service they are providing and comparing that with catv, telco
figures turn out to be higher by a factor of 10. Hence catv operators
who want to offer similar services will have to build a similar service
organisation using an efficient tool to manage this workforce and
minimising operational costs.

Barco's ROSA (RCDS Open Systems Architecture) system is designed to
fulfil this function. Starting with its FSM860 Headend Supervisor,
Barco has supplied monitoring and management tools for catv headends
and networks. All existing RF products have been equipped with
monitoring and remote control interfaces and all new units have a
serial control bus (Remote Control and Diagnostic System bus - RCDS)
allowing full remote control and automatic configuration.

The RCDS protocol was especially developed to configure and manage
hardware equipment in a catv environment making them easier and less
expensive to integrate into a management system. ROSA provides self-
healing capabilities, system performance testing and statistical
information to optimise operations and maintenance workforce.

A user-friendly GUI allows the user to define his own windows and views
on the information present in the system. The open architecture of the
database allows access by other systems via ODBC .

The ROSA system can be used as a powerful stand-alone management tool,
and as an intelligent element manager able to interface with overall
Telecom Network Management systems at different levels. ROSA also
provides the redundancy level needed for the headend to be competitive
with availability figures reached by Telecom switches. ROSA handles
multiple headends, distribution nodes and catv networks. For
communication between the sites and a Central Management Centre ROSA
supports X25, X31, ISDN, PSTN and other connections. Its modular
approach allows gradual integration into the CATV system.

GLOBAL DATA ACCESS

Building on its core database expertise, Oracle now provides
applications for specific catv industry sytem requirements

A key to cable operators increasing penetration figures is developing
billing and financial management systems which can turn customer
activity into revenue streams so cable operators should review their
information technology infrastructures now.

Oracl, which started as a developer of relational database software,
now provides information management tools forming the backbone of
applications for billing, subscriber management, financial management,
human resources and data warehousing (extracting information from a
variety of other systems and putting it onto one large database that
everybody can access).It also provides applications to help cable
operators proactively identify new areas of opportunity and broaden the
range of services they offer.

Customer account history is analysed in minute detail to build up
customer profiles and steer marketing and customer service activity,
helping build longer-lasting and more profitable customer
relationships.

Ocacle's multimedia and World-Wide Web products enable it to provide
cable operators with a new range of commercial services, and is working
with telcoms operators worldwide to test and deploy interactive and on
demand services. Oracle is helping create information warehouses that
can manage, store and organise all the multimedia data for these
services, and its media servers support millions of clients and a host
of consumer devices.

Telecommunications-related activity now accounts for 23 per cent of
Oracle's US $3 billion world-wide turnover and its dedicated team of
more than 130 telecoms consultants now service every major cable
operator in the UK. Oracle recently supplied a suite of financial
applications including stock control, purchasing and foreign currency
management to Telewest Group, UK. For Bell Cable Media, Oracle is
putting in a financial suite to manage its UK franchises and an inter-
admin accounting system to manage wholesale retail telecommunications
traffic by different interconnect partners.

Birmingham Cable's new subscriber management and billing system is
based on Oracle technology. And Nynex, whose key supplier for billing
systems is IBM, made substantial purchases of Oracle technology last
year to deploy across all its UK franchises.

Oracle provided staff to see what the cable operators wanted, then
developed a technology approach responsive to the individual and
rapidly changing needs and goals of its potential client base.

NETWORK TRANSMISSION ENHANCED

The Harmonic Lightwaves HL 5000 series network management system
developed to enhance network transmission performance and subscriber
satisfaction will continuously and automatically poll up to 500 network
elements, displaying status on screen, with immediate problem
identification and alarm for early trouble shooting.

Colour coded indicators allow operators to dispatch service technicians
directly to trouble sites, so minimising down-time. Background polling
is constant with logging of performance history time and date stamped
for analysis of recurring problem areas, forecasting of service
requirements and planning preventative maintenance.

Four screen levels lead the user through problem identification; first
screen - complete system overview; second - zoom in on selected
network; third - digital or alarm level view of the chosen equipment;
fourth - the analogue or parameter level indicators of the selected
hardware. After problem identification and location the operator can
restore the system. Components in an NMS 5000 system are: software,
computer, transponder, and serial port interface. Advantages include
real-tie system management, control and monitoring at the headend or
hub, instant access to system status; performance logging; malfunction
pinpointing; layered software; secure remote monitoring and
troubleshooting and ability to drive alarms and third party interfaces.

RISK MANAGEMENT PAYS DIVIDENDS

Customer analysis and profiling reduces bad debt and can also
facilitate packaged marketing, fostering customer loyalty

It is critical for cable operators to get a fast return on investment,
hence whatever the technology, territory or sales environment, the key
business areas of marketing and risk management play a key role in
achieving this objective.

The pressure to recruit new subscribers should be balanced with a
realistic view of risk management. Return on investment and
profitability also relys on customers using the service and paying
their bills.

In areas where the licence requirement is to offer the service to all
in franchised areas, door-to-door is a logical means of achieving
blanket coverage. Moreover, it is a tried and tested tactic in the US
and represents proven experience which MSO's apply in new territories,
with telemarketing and direct mail as a support tactic. It is a key
requirement to target activity appropriately. Both catv and telephony
may be viewed by operators as mass services within concentrated
geographical areas, the method of marketing varies according to
different user groups as families young people and senior citizens view
the same services very differently.

Different targetting tools are used to achieve different objectives.
Area Analysis - understanding the territories in which operators work -
is critical for both engineering and sales/marketing activity. These
areas include franchises, nodes and sales territories, all of which
drive build and sales initiatives. Cable operators use geo-demographic
data alongside post office and local authority data. Many UK operators
use CCN's Mosaic to classify individual postcodes as neighbourhood
types. The analysis entails reporting and mapping; mapping can be
undertaken within the Mosaic software and, for more detailed
definition, within operators' own geographic information systems (GIS).

Customer analysis and communication: understanding the profile of
customers is vitally important to operators if they are to provide the
best service and to foster loyalty. The analysis of customer behaviour
(ie service take-up, payment history, attitude to service etc) is
undertaken using operators' own data as well as external data such as
Mosaic. Resulting analysis is used to target direct response (mail or
phone), direct sales activity and to provide management information.
CCN has designed an appropriate PC database package specifically for
use by cable companies.

After identifying customer types most appropriate for cable services,
sales and marketing activity is initiated. Risks attached to taking on
new business include - will the applicant pay? Is the applicant who
they say they are? As cable develops there is increased risk of
consumers swapping suppliers and of fraudulent activity. With swapping,
there is the temptation to run up a bill with one supplier before
defaulting and moving to another (eg BT to cable). There is also a
growing threat from serious fraudsters using features such as three-way
calling to divert calls internationally in call selling operations
which never pay service bills.

Operators check creditworthiness using their own proof of identity
procedures as well as credit referencing techniques supplied by
agencies such as CNN.

Isuses and solutions involved include: application risk assessment
where potential customers wishing to apply for service are credit
checked using Credit Referencing Agency (CRA) data. Scorecards used to
assess applications range from generic designs such as CCN's Delphi
through to bespoke cards designed to incoprorate the operators own
poliices.

Application processing entails capturing the details of an applicant,
applying the scorecard and delivering the result for installation
action to create an efficient customer service. Systems such as CCN's
autoscore incorporate the individual requirements of each client.

Previous fraudulent activity is one of the best warning signs for
avoiding or intercepting the risk of fraud. CCN's Detect compares
existing and previous credit applications to identify inconsistencies
which may signal a potential fraud. The credit industry fraud avoidance
scheme (CIFAS) is another initiative which enables its members to share
information that is useful in identifying potential frauds, which
operators access through their CRA.

Once a history of customer behaviour has been built, further risk
scoring can be based on real experience. 'Behavioural scoring' allows
operators to identify customers for PPC or value added services.

CCN's international network operates marketing systems, CRA bureau
facilities and scoring services according to the data available in each
territory.

This flexibility enables key business issues to be addressed regardless
of the environment.

Operators have an opportunity to gain competitive advantage by making
full use of the technology and software available to the cable industry
to manage their marketing, risk and ultimately, profitability to
maximum effect.

IT'S A GO: ECHOSTAR LAUNCH PAVES WAY TO DBS

     Beijing, Englewood, CO -- EchoStar's satellite launched
successfully into orbit Dec 28 culminating a "huge event" in the
company's history, pres Carl Vogel said, as it grows out from big to
small dishes.  Propelled atop a Chinese-made Long March 2E launch
vehicle in Sichuan province, the $200mln bird launches EchoStar to
contender-status in the surging DBS marketplace.  Wall Street gave its
immediate approval: the day before the launch Echostar's stock traded
shy of $21/share; Friday it ranged near $25.  Vogel said the satellite
can support 100 channels, with service beginning Feb or March from
Cheyenne, WY.  Vogel said the Cheyenne location will allow EchoStar to
send its signals to Europe and Asia.

JUST SAY NO: VA VILLAGE TURNS BACK ON CABLE SERVICE:

     Waterford, VA - In the tiny, 262-year-old village of Waterford,
VA--where the 250 residents still pick their mail up at the post
office and drink well water--cable TV is persona non grata. 
Cablevision of Loudoun had planned to bring service to Waterford, but
dropped the proposal after residents' unenthusiastic response to a
survey.  Some said cable lines hanging from utility poles would ruin
the ambiance of the village near Washington, DC, and others said cable
would prompt families to watch more TV instead of socializing with
neighbors.  With cable wired to 63% of U.S. households, some cable
industry officials said they could not recall another case in which a
community rejected cable.  "Most communities are frustrated that they
can't get cable," observed a TCI exec.

YEAR IN REVIEW: 

     1995 was a year in which stock prices reached record levels and
cable industry shares rebounded from reregulation with hopes of
deregulation.  The perception is that while inflation may be in check,
the new low yield on the 30-year long bond indicates that the economy
may be sputtering.  Market sages predict that small cap and
international equities are places to investigate.  As long as grumpy
old men--starring Veto Bill Clinton and featuring a cast of stubborn
congresspersons--hold the nation hostage with political self interest
and a bad case of moral indignation, the refreshing thought of
conservative fiscal restraint could well give way to a very nervous
stock market.  Although most citizens did not notice that the
government was closed down, a resolution of the budget impasse is
necessary to level the playing field at least back to politics as
usual. -- Philip M. Getter, Josephthal Lyon & Ross

     The Cable Guy   ...is a movie currently being filmed (I think);
anyway, that hot comic actor Jim Carrey is getting $20,000,000 to star
in it. 
     Last week (just in time for something to write about!), my
friends in Texas, Bill Arnold and Nancy McMurray of the great Texas
Cable TV Association (mark your calendars for February 21-23 to make
certain you are in San Antonio with us!), sent me something that
purports to be a draft copy by Lou Holtz, Jr. 
for script of The Cable Guy.
     Now, I cannot attest to the verity of the package that arrived
from Austin, but I can attest that I'm certain the National
Association of Broadcasters paid to have it written!
     (It is, by the way, kind of funny in a sick way.)
     In fact, one of the more poignant (for those of us in the cable
industry) scenes involved The Cable Guy telling his "mark" all about
how he--because he can turn state's evidence and testify against the
poor schmuck who got cable for "free"--can get away with stealing
while the general, unwashed public cannot.
     "Me ... I'm just the cable guy.  How many of us are there in the
entire country?  Five thousand?  Ten thousand?  I'm one bad apple in a
small group. 
     "But you ... You're Joe Citizen.  You're one of five hundred
million people who'd love to get cable for free ... This is a
multi-billion dollar industry and still growing.  They've got to make
an example of someone..."
     And, just in case you might think any news or publicity is "good
news," check out this description of the Friendly Cable office:
     "The Friendly Cable building is exactl what you would expect it
to be.  The office building was probably built in the 'cable rush' of
the early eighties.  It lloks like one of those new three-story
buildings that was built cheply.  There is a CLOSE-UP of the company
logo on the door.  The logo is a big
television set whose picture tube has eyes, a nose, and an ear-to-ear
grin 
  ... "
     The script, of course, revolves around everyone's greed at
getting something for nothing ... in this case, free cable premium
channels.
     Oh, if only people did want premium channels so badly!  (Just
kidding.) Carrey is perfect for the insidious, insinuating and
downright dangerous cable guy ... can't wait to see the movie.  Think
the studio will do a special preview for us?  Maybe at the NCTA?
     This movie is no favor to the cable industry ... but that's just
tough luck unless the industry can unite to make amnesty  (temporary,
naturally) a major tie-in with the release date.  Just thinking out
loud ... any takers?  Any other ideas?  Want a bootleg copy of the
script?
     Random Notes:
     *1996?  4 more years?  In Clinton's case, it sounds like a curse.
     Happy New Year, anyway.

TV NATION
On-line program listings have potential for publishers and viewers

For the true television aficionado, the weekly listings printed in a book
distributed over the weekend are not enough.

Canceled shows, vague sports listings ("If the playoffs go to seven games,
then none of these programs will air.")  and the whims of station managers are
not accurately reflected.

The listings in the daily paper are marginally better, but they're usually
still 48 to 72 hours out of date.

For those with cable, there is usually a "preview" channel that has a window in
which specific programs are advertised, along with a "crawling" listing. The
problem is that for a 50-channel service, the "crawl" is literally that, taking
three to four minutes to get through all 50 channels.

No, the true TV aficionado wants his or her listings on computer -- in theory.

That theory has been adopted by the two major providers of TV listings. Both
Tribune Media Services and TV Data Technologies have built systems that allow
readers to access listings on-line, either through bulletin board systems
(BBSes) or the World-Wide Web.

Our resident TV aficionado, Pete Wetmore, who edits an award-winning TV book in
real life, takes a look at the two products (Tribune's is in operation in a
couple of places; TV Data plans to unveil its offering next month).

Wetmore comes away impressed with the technology, but a bit puzzled as to why
people would spend lots of time in front of their computers just to plot their
existence in front of the TV.

Nonetheless, this new technology does give one a chance to pause: With a good
on-line TV listings service and a mailroom that can handle "tailored"
newspapers, a publisher could stop sending the weekly TV book -- or even the
daily TV listings page -- to subscribers who partake of the on-line version.
That's quite a lot of newsprint.

Another example of how new technology can save newsprint comes from the Dayton
Daily News in Ohio. As the "local" paper for the Proximity Peace Talks -- held
to discuss the future of the former Yugoslavia at nearby Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base -- the paper was able to score a scoop: It acquired a complete copy
of the peace accords just after they were initialed.

Inside, we reprint a column Dayton Daily News Editor Max Jennings wrote for the
paper because it explains that in a newsprint-only world, he would not have
been able to adequately leverage the scoop. But with a World-Wide Web site, the
Dayton paper was able to reproduce the entire accords -- and make them
available to people around the world.

Jennings' point is that this new medium not only gives him the opportunity to
do new things, it also gives him the opportunity to give readers what newsprint
would have never allowed him to provide.

Our next stop is also new media-oriented: Rick Smolen, a photojournalist with a
long history at National Geographic as well as the Day in the Life coffee-table
books, pushes the envelope he pretty much personally created in photojournalism
CD-ROMs, with Alice to Ocean and Passage to Vietnam, with a new project: 24
Hours in Cyberspace.

Kurt Foss, electronic photojournalism expert (he's a big part of the digital
efforts of the National Press Photographers Association), talks to Smolen and
his merry band of picture takers about how they plan to move beyond CD-ROMs and
into the World-Wide Web for this new venture (Foss is a participant as well).

A shifting of thought patterns is also the basis for a piece by Cole Group
Consultant Mike Middlesworth, who talks about what a publisher should look for
when attempting to move into new technology -- and, specifically, what a
publisher should seek when retaining a consultant.

And, lastly, in the Hellbox we have news from P.INK and ISGI -- the two
German-based front-end suppliers have encountered rough patches recently, and
we take a look at what's going on.

Yes, so far we are a TV nation (though the Michael Moore show by that name was
recently canceled by its second network; your printed listings might reflect
it), but it seems like in a very short time we might become a PC nation.

-- David M. Cole

ON-LINE TV LISTING SERVICES NOW AVAILABLE FOR BBSES AND WEB

Digitized TV listings are a thing of the present.    The two major suppliers of
television program listings -- Tribune Media Services of Chicago and TV Data
Technologies of Queensbury, N.Y. -- introduced electronic listings last June at
NEXPO '95 in Atlanta.

Since then, Tribune has moved into the newspaper marketplace and TV Data has
taken its entry back to the drawing board.

In theory, digitized listings provide an easy way to find out what's on TV in
the 500-channel world the cable industry says is lurking just around the corner
-- an impossible task in the print realm, unless a publisher wants to make his
or her TV book a loss leader with capital "L"s.

By providing a PC-equipped television viewer with access to a database and a
slick GUI, the suppliers reasoned, newspapers could open a new revenue stream
-- through subscriptions and on-screen advertising -- and spend less time
keeping up with changes on the local cable systems.

And maybe one day, it was suggested, newspaper subscribers who took digitized
listings could be stricken from the print distribution list, saving the
newspaper old money while making new.

Both Tribune and TV Data have products now, and in the works, that deliver
listings (and ads) via either a BBS or a home page on the World-Wide Web.
Tribune has TV Week Interactive running on two web sites and a third is ramping
up to go on-line this month. TV Data plans to roll out its Internet version of
TV Data Online at the Interactive Newspapers conference Feb. 21-24 in San
Francisco.

Each iteration offers grids 10 or so channels deep, program details, search
engines for tracking down that elusive movie from the 1940s you're dying to
tape, customizable listing displays and the fun of playing with the future
now.

But having seen both suppliers' efforts in some form, this TV book editor has
to pose a $64,000 question: Who's going to use it?


Many viewers soon may have four ways to find out what's on TV:

*Their friendly, reliable, home-delivered weekly TV book. Compact, portable and
recyclable, the printed guide's contents are accessed with a flick of a thumb
and finger.

Occasionally, it arrives damp (or not at all), but it's cheap (as little as 35
cents, if the book is distributed any day but Sunday), it doesn't have to be
downloaded or dialed into (no phone charges), and it doesn't require a tribute
to Bill Gates to own one.

*On-screen guides. Many cable systems have set aside one channel to display
continuous, rolling listings. As cable has advanced, these displays have become
interactive, provided the subscriber has a box and a remote from the cable
company. Thus, a click on-screen changes channels to the desired program.

*The off-line PC application (no Macs need apply). Dial up the local
franchise's modem, set your software to receive and in a matter of minutes, a
week's worth of listings (two, if the franchise is Tribune's) are on your hard
drive.

Click on the application and, if you've done this before and have set up your
own customized view of TV land, you have tailored listings for on-screen review
or output to a printer.

*The on-line web source. Dial up the WWW, go to your local source (for that
matter, go to a distant site) and start asking for shows you want to see, or
click a button to see the grid for what's on right now, or scan the features
text for best bets, or -- Hey! Don't get too involved -- you're taking time
away from watching TV!

And that may be the telling issue with digitized listings: No matter how easy
they are to access, will viewers want to take the time to go to one video
screen to see what's on another? Or, even worse for broadcasters, will they
become so enchanted with surfing the listings that they forget why they went
there in the first place?

Perhaps there won't be a fair test until the 500-channel age dawns. For now,
we'll quit questioning the value of these packages and take a look at what they
do.

To get a sense of how non-print listings work, we screen tested the off-line
application TV Data Online (which is to be joined by a 'Net version shortly)
and visited three sites using Tribune's TV Week Interactive.

TV Data provided a phone number and password in order to download a demo of TV
Data Online. The Windows-based program (there are no plans for a Mac version
from either TV Data or Tribune) was a hefty 2.2 megabytes big, which took a
while to bring in at 9600 bps.

Listings downloads are much smaller, 250 kilobytes and up, depending on the
number of channels and cable systems in the subscriber's area.

When the app was kicked into gear, it first announced that new data were
available, and given permission, it brought in new material for movies,
features and grids a day at a time. Updating each day, on a Compaq '486 without
any special goodies, took about 30 seconds.

With TVDO, the user can set depths and widths for grid entries. Keep clicking
on a down arrow and soon five lines of text are displayed for each channel --
and "ABC" in a half-hour box becomes ABC World News This Morning. Similarly,
the width per box can be expanded and "ABC" again grows to its full title.

To see details about a program, just click on its box and a text window opens,
showing a synopsis of the show, who stars in it and other air times. (This last
bit of info is certainly a step ahead of the printed guide, aside from movie
logs.)

By going into a channel lineup dialog box, Mr. or Ms. Viewer can create a
user-specific lineup. Channels can be chosen from the master list for the cable
system being referenced, then sorted by channel, call letters or random (to add
an element of surprise, we presume).

When the setup is done, the user tells the app to store the new order, and a
data sort is performed -- taking another few seconds.

TVDO's grid is white with colored lettering, giving a visual cue as to the
nature of the program's content. Some time segments get pretty bright and
cheery, and perhaps too dazzling to be meaningful. But the visually intuitive
may find the idea practical.

One welcome feature in TVDO is keyboard commands. Menu choices can be keyboard
driven; at the right side of the screen are buttons with the same choices for
the mouse-and-click crowd. Among the buttons are days of the week, for quick
access to daily grids.

Two other screens give access to program details. One, Best Bets, opens a
screen with four buttons -- Best Bets, Soap Talk, TV Q/A and TV Trivia. A click
on Best Bets brings up text, with paragraphs alternating black and blue. The
text is identical to features copy provided to print clients of TV Data
Technologies.

Fortunately, we had a good look at TVDO before calamity struck -- the
application bombed. On restart, it asked whether to process new data again. We
declined, not wishing to spend the time, and found that our channel lineup
preferences had been saved.

When TVDO bombed a second time, it came back devoid of grid info, just a
garden-variety spreadsheet grid (from BaseCode) -- and no evident way through a
menu to tell it to go find the data it had refreshed before.

Upon reflection, we concluded that the curse we cast on suppliers at NEXPO
booths, where we're renowned for causing demos to explode, had visited yet
another supplier. Sorry about that.

(To get a static gander at TVDO, you can surf over to TV Data's web site,
http://www.tvdata.com/.)


Tribune's truly on-line product can be seen at three web sites -- Tribune's
demo home page (http://www.tmstv.com), Continental Cablevision of New England
(http://www.continental.com/) and Arizona Central (http://www.azcentral.com/),
the recently started web service of Phoenix Newspapers that also has a presence
on America Online.

On a first visit, the viewer is asked to designate which state and city in
which he or she lives. A multi-digit code is assigned to the user for future
use, or more simply, the viewer can bookmark a page past the initial sign-up to
provide rapid access the next time around.

A tour of these three sites shows the advantage to having 'Net access: no
lengthy download (we were running on a Mac Quadra 650 through a 28.8 kbps modem
to a local Internet provider), no strange interface (we are partial to Macs, we
admit) and fairly good response time.

Totally mouse-driven, Tribune's interface varies from site to site except for
its grids, which are color-coded click-maps.

On Arizona Central, movie titles appear in green, sports in yellow,
news/talk/special affairs in magenta, gray for everything else. Continental
uses a wider range: red movies, green children, blue drama (although talk
appears to be the same color), magenta comedy, green-on-gray news, a darker
green for documentaries and cyan for sports.

It makes for quite a display -- probably useful for some programming executives
plotting their next season, but near overkill for the common Joe, who has to
read the program block title to know just what's what anyway.

While Continental goes with grids and program searches right off, Arizona
Central features a color pic of the week's cover story, with a link to the
text. As with TVDO, the content is drawn from the print-oriented product. (One
drawback: The picture remains even after the program has aired.)

The Tribune search screen is simple but comprehensive, with fields for program
and/or episode title, and description. Click on the category field and a pop-up
menu provides so many choices, they stop at the letter "H."

The search can be narrowed by date, including those gone by, to the last day in
the data cycle (from Saturday through the second Friday hence). One of four
time blocks can be selected to further narrow the search.

Once done, the search returns a list of programs, with name, date, time,
channel number and service, program category and a few words about its content
(movies get stars). After one search on Arizona Central, we printed out 12
pages -- 45 items -- of "educational" programs airing for a one-week period.

And there you have it -- literally. Go take a look at the Tribune sites, and
drop by TV Data in a few weeks to see its 'Net offering when it becomes
available.


How does all this play in Peoria? Dunno, but several score miles west, a few
folks in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, have found it to their liking.

One of the first Tribune customers to go live was the company that publishes
the Cedar Rapids Gazette, which put the bulletin board version up for
subscribers early in the fall on FYIowa, a collection of electronic services
run by Interactive Media.

"Interactive Media basically is coordinating the efforts of all of the Gazette
companies," said Administrator Jim Debth. "When you go to FYIowa, FYIowa is the
umbrella for the Gazette, Iowa Farmer Today and Kcrg-TV."

FYIowa is overseen by Interactive Media, with two full-time people and a
half-time graphics person. One full-time person from the Gazette works on it as
well, Debth said, while one person at Iowa Farmer Today spends part of his time
at it, as do two people at Kcrg.

FYIowa also has a home page (http://www.infi.net/fyiowa/) through Internet
provider InfiNet of Norfolk, Va. In January, it will offer TV Vision, named
after the Gazette's weekly TV book. Now, subscribers to FYIowa's BBS can
download TV Vision for off-line use.

It's one of the first -- perhaps only -- instance where TV listings have
generated a revenue trickle. About one BBS user in 10 downloads the listings,
Debth said. Rates are $5.95 a month for 10 hours, $7.95 for 20 hours and $10.95
for 30 hours. Subscribers to the Gazette get $1 off.

"We actually have some reasonable response," Debth said about subscribers' use
of the BBS listings. "It'll be much more easy to get on our web site because
you won't have to download files."

While FYIowa will use the print name TV Vision, on-line "it'll be a much more
'Net-looking graphic," Debth said. Working with Tribune to prepare a web
version has been a snap, he said.

"Fortunately, we haven't had to do any of it ourselves, other than the graphic
we've provided them," Debth said. "We just kind of tell them this is how we'd
like the page to look."

That's the idea, according to Barbara Needleman, a marketing executive at
Tribune Media Services.

"We put up a site for them and design some wallpaper for it," said Needleman,
then wait for the client to ask for modifications. "If you put something on it,
they know what they want to change."

While Interactive Media may gain a smidgen of income from TV Vision off-line,
most publishers continue to feed the 'Net while not taking money back from the
content bottom-feeders.

"I don't think anyone is pricing it," Needleman said -- except, of course,
Tribune. While declining to provide a dollar figure for its fees, Needleman
indicated that TV Week Interactive was priced attractively, especially since
four tiers of service were available.

"There's different functionality in each of the tiers," she said, so costs and
benefits can be correlated well. "We've made it so that it's affordable for
papers who want to put something out but don't want to spend a lot of money
now, all the way to papers who want to do very cable-specific products."

At TV Data, pricing is not the immediate concern -- getting the product ready
for prime time is. Going back to the digital workbench was a marketing and
design decision, according to Mike Laddin, vice president for marketing and
product development.

"Frankly," Laddin said, "we felt there was some additional work we needed to do
on the product. We took some more time to make sure we did it right."

So he turned to Kevin Joyce, who had to look at his business card to find his
latest title: interactive and on-line services product manager. ("Maybe it
should be 'whatever is hot' product manager," he joked.)

Describing the NEXPO iteration of TV Data Online as "a very young product,"
Joyce said TV Data wanted to improve search times and screens.

"We cleaned up the user interface to the point that we threw out some things
that were confusing -- too many buttons, too many layers, too many menu items,"
he said of the CodeBasic-driven product. The result: "We reduced the amount of
steps for an action to take place, and made it easy to navigate."

Joyce said that last summer, TV Data also realized it had to contend with
several ways of delivering the data, not just through a BBS. "The Web, I think,
caught everybody by surprise," Joyce said. "It proves people are thirsty for
information and visual information."

As Prodigy was the first to show an interest in digital listings from TV Data,
it was natural to prepare for distribution through an on-line service -- but
also a proprietary bulletin board service, in this case Worldgroup from
Galacticomm of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for localized dial-up delivery, and
eventually on the Internet.

"There are a lot of flavors and ways that newspapers are setting up their
on-line services," Joyce said. "We didn't want to be tied directly or
intimately to any one style."

Hence, TV Data had to back up a bit from its ties to Galacticomm to make sure
that preparing for distribution via that route did not shut off other avenues,
such as a BBS already running at a newspaper that simply wanted to add TVDO to
its menu.

"We needed this product to work on a variety of delivery platforms," Joyce
said, although it is "totally a Windows-based product" in terms of the
end-user, unless you're running Win95. Cranking up for Win95 is undecided, as
"we're going to look and see what kind of a lifespan these off-line
applications have in general."

Is Laddin worried that Tribune has the jump on TV Data? Not hardly.

"In terms of the market overall and where we stand," Laddin said, "it's a new
media and it's an emerging marketplace for everyone -- Tribune, ourselves, the
newspapers."

"Everybody is very interested," he said. "There's a lot of activity, but the
papers are moving at a very deliberate way because everybody in the market is
still trying to figure out how they're going to make money. Short term,
nobody's making any money at this, at least up to now."

Compared to Tribune Media Services, TV Data has an enormous client base: more
than 2500 print clients, and a burgeoning role in providing data to on-screen
providers, such as cable companies and a new enterprise called VideoGuide Inc.
(http://www.vgi.com).

With backing from the Japanese trading firm Marubeni and consumer electronics
giant Sanyo, VideoGuide has set up a delivery system that uses the radio
frequencies of wireless pagers and presents listings on-screen (freshly
downloaded overnight). The viewer can click -- using VideoGuide's remote -- to
view or tape a program.

The product is being marketed through Tandy Radio Shack stores and other major
retailers in selected areas.


And so, as they say in TV land, stay tuned. How and when -- not whether --
digital listings end up in your home is the question.

More importantly, whether your newspaper will make any money off them is an
even more open question than it was last summer, when TV Week Interactive and
TV Data Online were rolled out.

The challenge lies ahead for publishers, while the suppliers have their part of
it well under way. For all, it's a big time learning experience.

What's it like, developing an on-line product? Kevin Joyce can tell you:

"Sometimes you end up reinventing the wheel. Sometimes you do it the right way
or a better way. At the very least, you do it the way you wanted it to be
done."

DATELINE DAYTON: ON THE WEB, SOMETIMES THE LITTLE GUY WINS

(This article ran as a column in the Dayton Daily News on Dec. 3, 1995, and is
reprinted here with permission.)


The story of how a midsize Midwestern daily scooped the world begins on the
blustery night of Nov. 22, the day the historic Bosnia peace plan was signed at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside Dayton, Ohio.

Most of the stories had been written and edited at the Dayton Daily News when a
couple of editors who rarely get to leave the office decided to go to the base
and have a look-see themselves.

John Thomson, the assistant managing editor, and Kevin Riley, a news manager,
decided this night that there might be some map information they could get
their hands on that could be used in our package on the complex agreement.

As they drove toward the base, their conversation turned philosophical.
Thomson, who has been in the business for more than 20 years and therefore
should know better, turned to Riley and said something to the effect that "the
only difference between the New York Times and us is our heads."

"We can do anything they can do," Thomson said, "if we just get our minds
right."

In that frame of mind, the pair sauntered into the press center, where a
three-star general was briefing a cluster of tired reporters.

During the briefing, they noticed a couple of out-of-town journalists had a
phone book-sized document no one else seemed to have. Thomson and Riley set out
to get their own copy, which they did. (How, dear reader, is a professional
secret.)

Closer inspection revealed that the document was, in fact, the complete
156-page version of the peace agreement.

The highly technical, precise language spelling out the details of the land
division was not grist for the local Ohio paper, but it certainly would be
fascinating stuff to the residents of the former Yugoslavia and their
neighbors, as well as to academics and other experts from around the world.

"What if," Riley asked Thomson, "we went back right now and scanned this into
our web site? Hey, we could scoop the world."

They headed back at flank speed to the office while alerting Newsroom Systems
Manager Jeff Adams that he had work to do. By 2 a.m., most of the pages had
been scanned in to the newspaper's Access Dayton web site on the Internet
(http://www.access-dayton.com).

Our web site had been the primary creation of another newsroom computer
enthusiast, Joe Cunningham. He set it up soon after the announcement that the
historic peace talks would be at Wright-Pat. Every bit of reporting we did on
the subject went onto the site, along with our photos, cartoons and the content
of a special 12-page section we produced on the opening day.

As was appropriate, our coverage was more comprehensive and detailed than
anyone else's we saw, and even before the latest caper with the final
agreement, the web site had become known to thousands, if not tens of
thousands, of people all over the world.

The technology allows easy tracking of how many hits a site gets, and from
where; in the first few hours, 525 people requested information from our
Bosnian web site.

We were astonished at what we had wrought. We had our data accessed and
downloaded from all over Eastern Europe, Russia, Canada, a dozen countries in
Latin America, the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Sweden, Singapore,
Australia -- every point of the globe.

We also found our reporting subjected to international review and criticism.

Vladimir Vuksan from Sarajevo sent a scathing e-mail to us that began: "I was
thoroughly disgusted to read the article (from the Dayton Daily News) in regard
to the rescue of an American airman by Serbian Chetniks. In those two pieces,
Serbian Chetniks are glorified as if they were the freedom fighters fighting on
the side of the Allies.

"Nothing could be more false. Serbian Chetniks were on the side of the Axis
through the most of the World War II and have done horrendous crimes against
Croatian and Muslim populations."

The next day, I received a personal e-mail from another unexpected source. It
began, "I read your column in Sunday's paper on all of the troubles you have
had telling foreign media representatives that Dayton is a place with qualities
not to be missed and to be taken into account.

"As one of those most deeply involved in all of these negotiation issues during
the past months, I can confess to having been somewhat surprised and even
skeptical when Wright-Pat and Dayton emerged as one of the alternatives.

"But that is now past us. After close to a week here, I can assure you that we
all feel that the choice of location was a good one. ... I can assure you that
we have all found Dayton much more to our liking than I believe any one of us
expected would be the case. And we appreciate seeing the world through the
prism of the Dayton Daily News!"

It was signed by Carl Bildt, who identified himself as co-chairman of the
Proximity Peace Talks, European Union special representative. To my knowledge,
Bildt was unavailable to the hordes of journalists covering the talks, yet here
he was writing me like an old school chum.

It's amazing stuff, this Internet. Which brings me to the conclusion of our
worldwide-scoop story.

The world knows now that a little paper in the middle of the United States is
the repository of the complete peace agreement. Accesses in early December hit
7000 in one day, again from every point of the globe, especially central
Europe.

And our list of admirers continues to grow. Our latest e-mail was from none
other than the U.S. State Department itself, which acknowledged it was the
Dayton Daily News -- not the federal government -- that disseminated the
information first.

Debi Guido-O'Grady, from the State Department's bureau of public affairs,
wrote: "Congratulations on an excellent site on the peace talks. You certainly
beat us in getting the full text of the agreement up on the Web.

"How long do you expect to keep the Dayton site active? While we are not
supposed to link to nonofficial sites, I was thinking of bringing up a 'reading
room' for other great resources for information (like yours) on Bosnia, on the
U.S. Department of State's official home page
(http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/dosfan.HTML)."

Thank you, State Department. It just shows you what can happen when you come up
against some of us Midwestern hayseeds.

PHOTOJOURNALISTS TO CHRONICLE CYBERSPACE FOR CD, BOOK, WEB

For more than a decade, photojournalist Rick Smolan and a roving band of
camera-toting friends have been steadily breaking new ground by combining the
power of great images with the changing tools of publishing.

Next month, he and his aptly named production company, Against All Odds, take
on their biggest challenge to date: documenting the worldwide impact of the
Internet.

Smolan began his series of popular Day in the Life coffee-table picture books
in the early '80s. For each, Smolan and 100 or so of his colleagues would
document one 24-hour period of life in a single country; each successive entry
has sought to be more technologically ambitious than the last.

His highly acclaimed From Alice to Ocean coverage -- photographed in the '70s
on assignment for National Geographic -- detailed a woman's solo trek across
the Australian Outback and became the first combination picture book
(Addison-Wesley, 1992, $49.95) and interactive CD-ROM.

Most recently, a similar but more sophisticated book-and-CD, Passage to
Vietnam, were the product of 70 photojournalists spending a week documenting
life throughout the nearly forgotten southeast Asian country, which has changed
considerably since the end of the war two decades ago.

Smolan's multimedia company, based in Sausalito, Calif., has gathered awards
hand-over-fist for Passage (Against All Odds, 1995), which skillfully blends
outstanding still images, maps, text, sound, video and related materials into
an awesome educational production.

Innovative features include a three-dimensional navigational device called the
Quebe, which gives a user a multitude of ways to experience the graphics-rich
content; several Forrest Gump-like appearances by a digitized Smolan, who drops
into several still images to narrate, and a gallery where selected
photographers stroll in and out of the scene while describing their
photographic portfolios and philosophies.

Sounds like a project that may be difficult to top, right? Wrong, at least if
Smolan's Feb. 8 project -- dubbed "24 Hours in Cyberspace: Painting on the
Walls of the Digital Cave" -- comes anywhere close to expectations.

"We have spent the last 12 years traveling around the world, documenting
different cultures," said Smolan. "For us, cyberspace is another culture and
place that we are going to, with the goal of documenting it during a typical
24-hour time period. But this time around, because of the nature of the new
medium itself, people can actively take part in the project, and respond with
their own point of view."

As with previous efforts, Smolan and his project team will hire and dispatch
100 of the world's top photojournalists around the globe to bring back stories
that reveal the myriad ways global telecommunications technologies are
affecting the professional and personal lives of people.

After soliciting story suggestions via the Internet and several commercial
services for the last few months, and screening digital-savvy photographers for
potential participation, the Cyber24 project team is putting in long hours this
month making final connections and arrangements that should make this one of
the largest on-line events ever conducted.

Karen Mullarkey, a free-lance visual consultant and former director of
photography at Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and Rolling Stone, leads the story
development team. Affiliations with a number of media, military, government and
business organizations will supplement the work done by the project
photographers.

Tentative plans include live support from the Associated Press and Reuters, the
Department of Defense (including peacekeeping photo coverage from Bosnia), the
Smithsonian Institution, Nasa, the United Nations and Disney. In addition,
millions of people on-line are being invited to submit their own stories of how
the digital revolution is affecting their lives.

J. Carl Ganter, an assignment editor for the project, is a veteran photographer
for several of Smolan's Day in the Life projects. But this time, he's on the
other side, just one member of the team that's trying to pull this daunting
project together.

"The cooperation between cutting-edge firms (and project underwriters) like
Adobe Systems, Sun Microsystems and Eastman Kodak is exciting," he said.
"Imagine importing a digital picture and running Photoshop in the blink of an
eye. To do this, the tech team has put together an amazing high-speed network
to handle the huge blocks of text, digital pictures, audio and video generated
on the day."

Ganter, who's also coordinating and editing audio for the project, says web
cruisers (http://www.cyber24.com/) will be able to hear photographers' comments
about their subjects -- minutes after the pictures are published.

"After photographers transmit their images to headquarters, we'll debrief them
by telephone, edit their recorded comments and include them in the site,"
Ganter said. "So visitors to Cyber24 will have a chance to be virtually on
assignment with the team. There will be a lot of other exciting, cutting-edge
multimedia surprises as well."

One of the newest photo technologies to be used is a method for creating
interactive, 360-degree photographs called PhotoSpheres by merging two separate
still images with software developed by Knoxville-based Omniview Inc.. Ten or
12 world landmarks will be photographed and published as spherical scenes on
the project's web site. A special free downloadable OmniView viewer will be
needed to view and navigate inside the images.

Mission Control for the project will be in San Francisco's China Basin, where
all photos and stories will be transmitted throughout the "day," a 48-hour
period as Feb. 8 moves across the world's time zones.

On that date, an instant web site will be updated every 30 minutes or so --
beginning at midnight Pacific Standard Time -- as new content is received,
cataloged into an Illustra database and uploaded to the web pages designed by
Clement Mok, the former art director of Apple Computer and the designer
responsible for the look of the Microsoft Network.

After a few days, the project home page will close. Around March 15, after a
team of editors has had a chance to review all content captured by its select
photographers and other participants, a permanent "time capsule" web site will
open with additional materials (it will also be a showcase for the latest in
web publishing tools).

A picture book and CD will be released in the fall.

Faculty at the Rochester Institute of Technology are coordinating "the world's
largest photo classroom," a parallel, collaborative project for journalism
educators and students worldwide. The best stories will be added to the
project's main web site, while the schools also will maintain their own home
pages with additional materials related to 24 Hours.

Prizes donated by corporate sponsors will be awarded for the top student
entries.

Global participation on the date is being strongly encouraged; specifications
and submission details are available on the web site. Entries may be
transmitted via the Internet or one of several commercial on-line services,
including America Online, CompuServe and PressLink.

The project will be the featured event at the grand opening of the Internet
1996 World Exposition (http://park.org/fair/), a world's fair for the
information age.

HOW CONSULTANTS CAN PLAY KEY ROLES IN PLANNING BIG PROJECTS

One day recently a friend said to me, "I know you're a consultant, but what do
consultants do and why do people hire them?"

I gave him what was essentially a non-answer and we went on to other things.

Later, after I'd thought about it a bit, I told him I'd kind of kissed off his
question and that, if pressed, I'd have to say this:

Consultants help businesses improve profits by helping solve problems, and
there are as many reasons for hiring them as there are problems in running a
business.

Newspapers, for example, hire consultants for a variety of reasons.

Sometimes, a specific problem requires technical expertise not found among
those on the payroll. Planning a computer network, for example, is often a
one-time job where a consultant can come in, examine the problem and make
recommendations in a much shorter time than it would take someone on the staff
to get up to speed.

Often a newspaper can benefit from having a problem looked at by "a fresh eye,"
someone who's not too close to the situation -- a person who is not involved in
internal turf wars, nor carries any baggage as far as relationships are
concerned.

Remember, too, that many attempts to solve problems end up in finger-pointing
and attempts to place blame. An outsider doesn't deal in reward and punishment;
he or she is there to focus on fixing the problem.

Independent consultants usually get openness from managers and others involved
in a problem simply because they're not involved in the normal office
politics.

Independent consultants often come to you with broader experience and more
industry contacts than people on your staff, especially at newspapers where few
managers attend trade shows or are sent to seminars at such places as the
American Press Institute.

An independent consultant can be of greatest benefit, in my view, when a
newspaper is going to undertake a major project.

Newspapers are rarely overstaffed. All the managers work hard at their
day-to-day responsibilities with barely enough time to work on next year's
budget, let alone take on a major project.

These problems multiply when the project -- say, pagination -- is one that
involves many departments of the newspaper and affects processes, personnel and
equipment in all of them.

Working hand-in-hand with the executive assigned to spearhead the project, a
consultant can give it his or her full attention, uninterrupted by the phone
calls that start, "I know you're working on that project, but this little
problem has come up and can you just take a few minutes to ...?"

Also, few newspapers have people on their payroll with the knowledge of
interdepartmental relationships needed for many major projects.

Yes, you can set up a committee, then charge it with studying the issue and
coming up with a recommendation, but unless you have an exceptional group, each
panelist will view it from his or her own narrow perspective.

They need help in seeing the big picture.

In pagination projects, for example, newsroom managers more often than not see
only that it is going to take them longer to deal with pages in the newsroom.
What they don't see is the reduction in time, overall, to get the paper on the
press.

Part of a consultant's role is to provide that big-picture view. Along with it,
a good consultant will also try to make all participants fully aware of how
everyone benefits from a major project. There are benefits for all departments
of a newspaper from pagination, although sometimes they're hard to see, or
attain, without understanding the entire process.

When do you need a consultant? When you look around and don't see anyone with
the expertise needed to solve the problem at hand. Or, if you do have someone,
you recognize that the enterprise would suffer if you assigned the task as a
full-time responsibility.

There are times when a consultant can serve as a referee and help you decide
who's right when two department heads make very good cases for doing something
their way.

Or, frankly, you might want to bring in a consultant if you'd like to have
someone from out of town to blame if things go wrong.

How do you find a consultant and what should you expect?

Talk to other newspapers, talk to suppliers -- they know who's knowledgeable in
their fields. Check out the trade publications. Those are all good places to
start.

I've always believed, as does Dave Cole, that consultants do a better job for
newspapers if they are independent and do not also work for or represent
suppliers. That's not to say that those who do are necessarily wrong; it's just
that old business of not wanting to appear beholden to anyone.

Once you've hit upon a likely prospect, outline your problem and ask for a
proposal. You should get -- in writing -- an initial action plan which most
often will prescribe a day or two of on-site evaluation, discussions with your
managers and the promise of a written report with recommendations.

The proposal should also include information about fees and expense
reimbursement for the initial visit.

Suppose you do find someone, you get a proposal and you accept it. Then what?

First, tell everyone in your plant that the consultant is coming and why. The
last thing you want is everybody wondering why there's a stranger poking around
the plant for a couple of days.

Then, gather those directly involved and ask for their full cooperation. Tell
them you expect them to be candid with the consultant, and that they must clear
their calendars as much as possible so as to be available while the consultant
is in the plant.

You're going to be spending a fair amount of money, so you want to be sure that
the consultant gets the information needed.

Arrange for a manager to serve as host, and to use time to best advantage, ask
that lunches be arranged with people involved in the project.

It's always nice, from the consultant's point of view, to have a place in the
building to use as a base. Perhaps the office of the person most involved with
the project or problem would serve best.

You should meet privately with the consultant at the beginning and end of the
visit. Be sure that the opening discussion includes your view of the problem
and some agreement on expectations.

Be candid. If there are personnel problems or peculiar situations to be
factored in, discuss them. Ask for and expect discretion. If you want appraisal
of personnel, this is the time to ask for it so the consultant can take the
measure of people while assessing the situation from the start.

Make it clear that you'll be available should problems or questions arise.

It can be beneficial to gather your troops for a session with the consultant
just prior to your end-of-visit interview. That's when any second thoughts can
be aired, or promised information delivered.

Expect a reasonably detailed report of findings and recommendations within a
few days of the on-site visit. If called for, you'll probably get a proposal
for an ongoing relationship involving oversight, project management or hands-on
problem solving.

If a long-term relationship ensues, ask for regular progress reports, both oral
and written. Be sure that your people are cooperating fully, and that everyone
understands your goals.

None of this will insure success, of course, but it will certainly improve the
odds against failure.

AS LONG AS IT ISN'T ILLEGAL OR IMMORAL

Shortly after I started consulting six years ago, I read somewhere that
consultants who specialize in technology break into two distinct groups:

*Those who come into your office, take off their coat, roll up their sleeves
and start writing code or plugging computers into the network.

*Those who come into your office and never take off their coat.

Because my consulting practice has always used the "we'll do it as long as it
isn't illegal or immoral" credo, we have ended up not breaking into either of
these categories.

The no-coat consulting has always been fairly straightforward: you write the
code, you hook up the wires, you make sure it all works and then write some
documentation about how you did it, so that the newspaper doesn't have to hire
you again to make a minor change.

The coat consulting, on the other hand, is rife with the possibility for
misunderstandings and bruised feelings. On more than one occasion I've had to
tell a publisher that his or her biggest problem falls in the personnel
category: the wrong people in the wrong jobs can be as big a problem as a
misprogrammed computer.

Another big problem is to be hired to solve one problem but to find a bigger
one looming of which the staff is unaware. A couple of times I've been called
in to talk about pagination, only to find ancient classified or business
systems that would be an impediment to any pagination project. When the
publisher is confronted with having only enough money to buy a pagination
system or a new classified system, it's not fun to be the one to say the paper
has to postpone pagination until the other systems are brought up to snuff.

For me, the hardest part was coming to grips with the situation where the
publisher brings me in, gives me the run of the shop for a couple of days, gets
a verbal report before I leave, nodding all the while. And then I phone the
paper six months later to find that nothing has changed.

When I was a full-time newspaper employee, I learned to have my advice ignored;
I just thought that when I was a consultant that wouldn't happen any longer.

But I forgot: this is the publishing business.

CHAPCHAL OUT AT ISGI AFTER MERGER

Danny Chapchal keeps reaching for the brass ring of publishing system supply
firms -- and keeps missing.

The man who put together the deal to buy Atex from Kodak (and who subsequently
lost Atex to the Norwegian software company Sysdeco) had almost built a new
publishing systems powerhouse late in 1995, only to lose control at the last
minute.

After turning Atex over to Sysdeco last year (see The Cole Papers, January
1995), Chapchal worked out a deal with Integrierte Systeme Grafische Industrie
(ISGI) of Eschborn, Germany.

ISGI was developed in the early '90s as a publishing systems research
consortium funded by Siemens Nixdorf and Hell Graphics. Last spring, Chapchal
became a consultant for what had become Siemens Nixdorf-owned ISGI and put
together some Siemens Nixdorf PC-based publishing systems products that were
shown at NEXPO '95 in Atlanta (see The Cole Papers, September 1995).

The products were well received. ISGI took orders from the New York Daily News
and the 25,000-circulation evening Reading (Pa.) Eagle.

In the latter part of the summer, Chapchal was named chairman of ISGI and
immediately set about finding a partner to build up the company. He found one
in Italian investor Tullio Ponzi, who in recent years had built International
Publishing Associates Holding Ltd.

IPA Systems is a holding company that owns Monotype Publishing Systems of
Rolling Meadows, Ill., and the United Kingdom; H. Berthold of the United
Kingdom; Freedom System Integrators of Wichita, Kan.; QED Technology Ltd. of
Cheltenham, England; GB Techniques of Prestwick, Scotland, and Scangraphic
PrePress Technology of Wedel, Germany.

IPA Systems was created by Ponzi and longtime industry executives Peter Purdy
and Charles Crocker in 1992 and '93. Crocker left the business in 1993. Purdy
died in October 1994.

On Nov. 8, Siemens Nixdorf transferred ownership of ISGI to Scangraphic (a
legalistic nicety -- Scangraphic would not take over ISGI's business, and each
would operate separately).

The plan was that Chapchal would be in charge of the new ISGI, which would
incorporate the resources of Freedom Systems, QED and GB Techniques.
Specifically, the deal gave Chapchal a presence in the United States, along
with a sales force.

But within days of finalizing the deal, Ponzi and Chapchal had a falling out.
Although Chapchal remains a consultant to ISGI, he is no longer chairman.

Along with Chapchal's leave-taking, his lieutenants Ian Anderson and Rod
Fenwick -- who had both worked extensively with Chapchal at both Atex and
previous projects -- also left ISGI.

While no plans for the future of ISGI have been announced, the installation at
the Reading Eagle is going forward.

As an executive with Linotype in the '70s and early '80s, Chapchal was
president of its World Systems Inc. division, with corporate responsibilities
in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom.

In 1984, Chapchal returned to England, where -- in addition to being the chief
fund-raiser and chairman of QED Technology -- he was managing director of
Applied Research of Cambridge Ltd., a supplier of turnkey CAD systems.

Within two years, Chapchal became chief executive of Xenotron Holdings Plc.
Xenotron, a publishing systems supplier emphasizing display advertising makeup
systems, was shortly thereafter sold to the Hell publishing systems group in
Germany.

Hell ultimately killed Xenotron and most of its innovative technology.

Chapchal then orchestrated the sale of QED to Maxwell Communications Corp. and
took a position with Fifth Wave Technology Ltd., a division of Maxwell.

He left the publishing systems business in 1991 to run SQL Systems
International of Surrey, England, a supplier of asset management software.
Insiders indicate that within 18 months, Chapchal turned SQL from a company
that lost millions of dollars into a multimillion-dollar money-maker.

In 1993 Chapchal began discussions with Kodak about acquiring its Atex
division, and put the deal together that December. Chapchal used investors who
had been involved in the SQL restructuring.

In the course of his running Atex, those investors lost faith in Chapchal, and
in 1994 Sysdeco convinced the Atex board of directors to give it an equity
position in the company and a management contract.

Chapchal then began work on the ISGI project.

P.INK GERMANY ENTERS CHAPTER 11

P.INK, the Macintosh-based editorial front-end system whose history has been
mixed at best, has hit another stumbling block: bankruptcy.

The German company that developed the software -- P.INK Software Engineering
GmbH of Hamburg -- has filed Vergleichsbeantragung, the German version of
Chapter 11 reorganization. This type of bankruptcy filing allows a company to
keep its creditors at bay while it negotiates for better repayment plans and/or
the injection of working capital from new investors.

Reports from Germany indicate that P.INK had been planning on a fresh round of
financing from Scitex Corp. Ltd. of Herzlia, Israel -- one of its four owners
-- which was not forthcoming.

Speculation has implicated Scitex's 1995 third-quarter loss of more than $36.4
million as the reason it didn't make the investment. The loss might have left
the company cash-strapped and incapable of honoring its commitment to buy out
two of the other three owners of P.INK.

Scitex America executives did not respond to numerous phone and e-mail queries
regarding the P.INK situation.

Scitex, which markets the P.INK product line outside of Germany, Austria and
Switzerland, bought 25 percent of the company in February 1994 with an
agreement to acquire another 50 percent of the company over a two-year period.
The remaining 25 percent of P.INK would remain with its founder, president and
chief executive, Andreas Poliza.

The 50 percent of the company that Scitex was scheduled to acquire has been
owned by the German newspaper publishing group Madsack and a German software
company called Rechenzentrum Sdwest. Rechenzentrum has owned its 25 percent for
only a year.

The acquisition of P.INK was engineered by Scitex America Corp. executive Bob
Holt, a former editor at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Holt, based in Bedford,
Mass., spent much of 1993 in Hamburg, stopping off on his way to and from
Israel to work with Poliza to improve the software and iron out the long-term
relationship.

Scitex -- both in Israel and the United States -- has gone through massive
reorganizations recently. The head of Scitex America, George Carlisle, left the
company last summer. In November, Arie Rosenfeld, the president and chief
executive of Scitex Corp. Ltd. resigned amidst the fallout from the company's
sizable third-quarter loss.

Part of the reason for that loss was an $18 million charge for employee
termination benefits; many longtime Scitex executives have recently left the
company, including Scitex America's marketing executive Ken Hurtabise and
corporate communications executive Paul Thiele.

In addition, Scitex America announced in August the establishment of a
publishing division that would be responsible for the P.INK product line as
well as other Scitex products.

Scitex has sold the Mac-based P.INK system to two newspapers -- The Sun of
Bremerton, Wash., a 41,000-circulation evening daily, and the
63,000-circulation morning Evansville (Ind.) Courier. Both papers are owned by
Scripps-Howard.

In addition, Scitex smoothed the installation of P.INK at the Toronto Sun and
other Sun Publishing Corp. properties (which include the Calgary Sun, Edmonton
Sun and Financial Post), even though the Sun papers had purchased the product
directly from P.INK in Germany.

Executives at these papers were reluctant to be quoted about the situation, but
indicated that Scitex had told them, as one said, "not to worry."

"We've been told that the worst-case scenario is that Scitex will get the North
American rights to the P.INK code," said one newspaper executive.

Despite generally upbeat comments coming from customers, and published reports
that the staff has "expressed full support for the company," sources in Germany
indicate that P.INK programmers are extensively circulating their resumes.

The P.INK story in North America is not a happy one: Demonstrated under the
P.INK Software banner at ANPA/Tec 1990, the North American marketing rights for
the product were acquired in 1991 by the Time Magazine Group division of media
giant Time Warner.

For the next two years, P.INK America attempted to sell its software to its
sibling divisions -- magazines such as Time, People and long-time Mac user
Entertainment Weekly -- and newspapers and other magazines as well.

The potential customers, inside Time or not, were decidedly uninterested. In
1993, Time shut down P.INK America. It was another year before Scitex made its
deal, and despite the Scripps-Howard sales the company has had problems
building momentum for the product line.

Bit bucket ...

"We want them to pay enough money [to license Java] that it hurts a little bit.
It has to be something that you take seriously. For a company like Microsoft,
you charge them a couple of hundred thousand dollars, they don't even notice.
They blow that much on the fruit for one of their press events."

PC, GAME AND MULTIMEDIA HAVEN'T WRITTEN OFF CES YET

     But it's close.  Only a few suppliers have chosen to display
their wares at Winter Consumer Electronics Show (WCES).

     IBM is biggest computer-related company with products on
display.  Hardware from consumer Aptiva line will be shown, as will
software from its Multimedia Publishing Studio.  "We're going to
have a large booth," spokeswoman said.  Although CES no longer is
hot show from multimedia standpoint, attendance totals alone make
event worth attending, she said.  "They feel like there is still a
large draw to CES," she said.  Still, company is almost apologetic
about its presence.  "It's not a big launch," she said.  "We're
setting up a booth and demoing a lot of new products and having a
presence."

     As exhibitor, IBM is in tiny minority of multimedia hardware
and software companies.  Even though Packard Bell and others have
exhibited, it looks as though Compaq will be only other major PC
supplier in Las Vegas.  As for software, Microsoft will have hotel
rooms but no floor presence.  And small players such as Goodtimes
Interactive, which presented at last year's WCES, are almost
completely absent.

     Multimedia companies said CES just doesn't work as platform
for them any more.  "We painfully exhibited at the last summer
CES," High Technology Distribution Pres. Perry Solomon said.  High
Technology sells variety of computer memory products, including
recordable CD-ROM drives, through its Smart & Friendly unit.  "I
grew up in the consumer electronics industry, and we certainly feel
that the consumer electronics channel is a valid one for our
products," he said.  "But we're not 100% sure that the Winter CES
is an appropriate forum."  For Smart & Friendly, must shows are
Winter Comdex and CeBit in Hamburg, Solomon said.

     One show rules on entertainment software side:  Los Angeles
Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), coming in spring.  Although
only in 2nd year, E3 has secure position as top software forum in
U.S. for videogame and PC entertainment software, robbing CES of
its largest combined exhibitor category.  "We'll be at E3,"
Microsoft Senior Group Mktg. Mgr. Marty Taucher said.  "We've got
a fairly substantial space in the main hall."

     That doesn't mean Microsoft -- or Smart & Friendly, for that
matter -- is writing off WCES completely.  "It's not clear to us
whether CES will have a big role for us in the future, but we'd
like to keep our options open," Taucher said.  "We'll be at suites
and doing meetings, but we won't have a floor presence."

     Smart & Friendly's main market is business users, Solomon
said.  But PC products are evolving so that eventually they will be
consumer electronics products, he said.  That's why he's taking a
"wait-and-see" attitude with WCES.  He hoped show would regain some
of its multimedia strength but isn't certain it will.  Summer CES's
decline as major show was very upsetting, he said.  "I've attended
so many CESes over so many years, and to watch a show that was so
strong and so powerful die was painful to me," he said.  "It proves
you've got to stay close to the market all the time.  I don't know
what happened, but somehow it lost its course."

     In attempt to provide some multimedia energy to mix, CES has
added 2 seminars to workshop:  "Multimedia Software Distribution: 
The New Model" and "Multimedia:  What Is the Consumer Looking For." 
Other panels already scheduled include "The Desktop PC Market --
What Consumers Want," computer manufacturer executive panel and
"Riding the Consumer Interactive Wave."  Strangely, Compaq
Pres.-CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer is show's keynote speaker.

FEW SURPRISES IN SPECIFICS FOR UNIFIED 'DVD' FORMAT

     New unified high-density optical disc format will be called
"DVD" and will feature Dolby AC-3 digital audio for NTSC markets,
MPEG audio for PAL and SECAM countries.

     Those were highlights of mid-Dec. announcement that
negotiators for former MultiMedia CD (MMCD) and Super Density (SD)
had completed work in Tokyo on technical specifications of unified
DVD format for PC ROM and home theater applications that's said to
combine best features of rival systems.  While agreement on
technical specs appeared to give green light to start
labor-intensive effort of designing final components for late-1996
launch, patent and licensing issues hadn't been addressed.  Philips
Key Modules Pres. Jan Oosterveld, company's key negotiator in
unification talks, said no fewer than 9 working groups had been
formed to hash out remaining administrative issues.  He refused to
project how long effort might take other than to say it would have
to be finished before products can be launched in 1996.

     Main specifications are same as those reported 3 months ago
when warring parties announced preliminary pact on unified standard
(CMR Sept 18 p1).  Basic disc is adapted from SD proposal for
bonded 5" media composed of 2 layers, each 0.6 mm thick.  Data
capacity is 4.7 gigabytes per side, using "RS-PC" error correction
system from SD proposal, "8-16" modulation system from MMCD
proposal.  System operates at average data transfer rate of 4.69
mbps.  Of 11 main technical points that comprise basic system,
Oosterveld said unified format draws equally from MMCD and SD
proposals.

     Unified system adopts Dolby AC-3 as mandatory choice in NTSC
countries for DVD digital audio, with MPEG audio as option. 
Reverse is true in PAL and SECAM markets.  Oosterveld said decision
using 2 digital audio systems in world heeds suggestions by movie
industry to adopt pattern consistent with disparity in TV standards
as means of controlling international distribution of home video
repertoire for copyright purposes.

     As for DVD name, briefing documents obtained by our affiliated
newsletter Audio Week said that while DVD is "formal name" of
unified format, "it is not meant to be an abbreviation for
anything, though in the past it stood for digital videodisc." 
Negotiators said "we believe the 'V' can also stand for
'versatile.'"  Documents said 9 companies "will now undertake
discussions in an effort to develop a patent licensing system." 
Companies listed are Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Philips,
Pioneer, Sony, Time Warner, Toshiba.  Roster didn't include
Thomson, which was described as having "worked closely on DVD
development" and "has expressed a desire to join the discussion."

     "From today on," statement said, "the companies supporting DVD
will propose and promote a wide range of applications for the
format.  They will continue to develop the technology and work to
position DVD optical discs as the ideal storage medium for the age
of multimedia."  Companies said they plan soon to announce logo for
use on all DVD movie players and ROM drives.  Oosterveld said
"competition" period officially has begun, meaning no formatwide
promotional booth is planned at Consumer Electronics Show or other
trade events.

     DVD "core" developers -- Philips, Sony, Matsushita and Toshiba
-- are expected to form joint corporation to administer DVD
patents.  Secondary tier of companies laying claim to inventions
incorporated into unified DVD standard would join patent pool. 
Toshiba sources in Tokyo told us Thomson had resisted proposal,
expressing preference to enforce own optical disc licenses. 
However, same sources said later that Thomson had tempered its
opposition to pool system in bid to project united industry front
in promoting DVD awareness before late-1996 launch.

     Negotiators tiptoed around questions on DVD video copy
protection, and briefing papers suggested only that variety of
"options are possible."  Sakon Nagasaki, dir. of Matsushita DVD
Promotion Office, told Tokyo news conference that he expects
adoption of Copy Generation Management System (CGMS), now being
developed by numerous companies.  He said CGMS would form basis of
legislation in U.S. based on proposal being negotiated by hardware
companies and movie industry.

     Copyright holders warned that unless protection issue is
settled, they won't put material on DVD.  "Our excitement for the
DVD format continues to grow," MCA Home Video Pres. Louis Feola
said.  "However, in the event there is not an encryption mechanism
that prevents all forms of copying, whether digital to digital or
digital to analog, we will in all likelihood not be supporting the
format," he told us.  He said acceptable DVD encryption system
"must be applied to all forms of hardware, including computers."

     In separate development, Thomson signed "multiproduct" OEM
deal with unnamed Japanese manufacturer covering "digital and
video" products, including DVD players that can be sold in U.S. as
low as $500 starting late in 1996, Exec. Vp Joseph Clayton said. 
Thomson is expected to identify Japanese partner at Las Vegas news
conference set for eve of this week's Consumer Electronics Show.

     DVD technology already is advancing.  Sanyo said it developed
new laser pickup capable of reading DVDs and conventional CDs. 
Dual-use red laser pickup, which will have output power of 5 mw,
will be built using DVD wavelength of 635 nanometers, one of 2
wavelengths specified in unified DVD format announced Dec. 8. 
Unlike existing dual-focus pickups requiring use of 2 lenses, Sanyo
device uses LCD shutter system to change characteristic of laser
needed for specific types of disc.  Sanyo said LCD method makes for
smaller and more reliable pickup.  Sample shipments will start in
March, Sanyo said.

DSS PRICING FOLLOWING CE ROUTE -- DOWN

     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to drop
and competition increases, entry-level product appears poised to
dip below $300 -- or even less -- consistent with traditional
consumer electronics pattern.

     "You've got some very big players coming into the business [in
1996] and many aren't going to be able to take the high road,"
Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you are 6
to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."  To combat falling prices,
some retailers are focusing on step-up RCA and Sony DSS products
that promise 20-25% profit margins but slower sales.  Overall, 1995
unit sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to dealers were expected to
surpass 1.5 million, while rival Primestar reported close to
million subscribers.

     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze CE suppliers,
who have said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones where
hardware is offered to consumers virtually free and profits are
made on service.  Echostar spokeswoman conceded as much.  Echostar
hasn't released pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardware
retails could hit $500, with programming at $20.

     Lower retails are expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshiba
and Uniden enter DSS this year, with Uniden already indicating it
may price product at $499-$549.  In addition to DSS, Alphastar and
Echostar plan to introduce own services, latter partnering with
Philips to bring Magnavox product to CE retail.  Even Primestar,
which primarily has leased equipment to consumers, has tested sales
through TCI.

     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2
powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCA
and GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has been
advertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony piece recently broke
below suggested list price in Wiz ad at $648.

     DSS installation charge also has dropped in some markets to
$99 vs. $150 range when product was introduced in 1994.  Signs are
that pricing trends will gather momentum as market and number of
suppliers expands.  Two recent entrants provide examples:  Uniden
and AlphaStar.  Uniden will ship 2 DSS products by mid-1996 at
$499-$549, Exec. OEM Vp Hide Kanakubo said.  AlphaStar will launch
medium-power satellite service late in first quarter with product
at $600-$700 and sales limited to distributors and direct
marketers, Pres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein said.

     Uniden systems will sell in packages that include integrated
receiver decoder (IRD), 18" dish, low-noise blocker (LNB), remote
control.  Production is expected to begin in April, deliveries in
May, Kanakubo said.  Uniden has said it was considering hybrid
product compatible with C-band system as well as possibly building
IRD into other CE products.  First 2 models will be standalone
units, Kanakubo said.

     With Thomson's low-end RCA DSS product already appearing
advertised at $499, Uniden will have to hit lower retails, Kanakubo
said.  "The expectation at retail is that Uniden will be priced
lower than RCA or Sony," he said.  Lower prices could cross $400
barrier in 1996, industry observers said.  To differentiate itself
in market that also is expected to include Toshiba by mid-1996,
Uniden will sell products through satellite distributors and CE
retailers, Kanakubo said.

     Companies are taking variety of approaches to avoid dealing
with margin-slashing consumer electronics market.  Alphastar is
avoiding retail channel, relying on combination of Amway, satellite
distributors and multilevel marketing.  Company will sell single
IRD with 30" dish and remote control to satellite dealers through
distributor O'Rourke Bros. and to consumers through Amway and
multilevel marketer United Digital Bcstg. Corp.  Programming will
be sold in packages at $24-$49, with some consisting of 40 video
and 30 audio channels.  Premium pay packages and a la carte
channels will retail at $4.95-$14.95 per month, 16 PPV channels at
$2.99 per movie.

     Full 120-channel service, to be available within 2-3 weeks of
launch, will consist of 85 video, 30 audio and 3-5 data services. 
IRD contains RS-232 port to connect to PC to download data services
as well as gain access to Internet, Klippenstein said.  IRD also
will use MPEG-2 data transmission and have LED.

     Tightly focused marketing is key to AlphaStar's approach,
Klippenstein said.  "We're targeting specific customer bases rather
than going with a mass market approach that requires huge inputs of
advertising, media, and consumer electronics distribution," he
said.  Giveaway DSS systems are almost inevitable, Klippenstein
said.  "I would think that for this product the equipment would
pass the cost curve much more rapidly than the marketing cost of
attracting a subscriber," he said.  "When that happens it makes
sense to give the box away because the long-term value is in the
subscription and the ongoing revenue that comes from that
subscription."

FATALITIES THREATENED IN CHINA PIRACY WAR

     Sums involved in hardware and software piracy are spurring
threats of physical harm in China, where illegal videogame console
total rivals legal units in U.S.

     War of words over piracy is threatening to turn into real
thing, as videogame cartridge and console and CD-ROM software
contraband markets explode.  "The gray market is our biggest
competitor worldwide," said executive with one leading videogame
company.

     China is leading violator on both CD-ROM and videogame fronts
-- but Eastern Europe is working hard to catch up.  There are 297
CD and CD-ROM plants in world, of which 30 are in China, and
pirated copies represent 59% of China's CD market, according to
London-based International Federation of Phonographic Industry
(IFPI).  Relatively new area for piracy is Bulgaria, with 4 CD
production lines in 3 plants.  Until Sept. 6, when 2 long-standing
European copyright conventions came into effect in Bulgaria, there
was no protection for foreign recordings, so all 3 plants were
producing unauthorized copies.  That situation is beginning to
change, copyright activists report. 

     One sign of intensity of struggles was recent temporary
shutdown of IFPI's Guangzhou, China, office.  "We've heard through
somebody that contract killers have been employed," said IFPI
Communications Dir. Catrin Hughes.  Leads were "pretty solid," she
said.  "It's not the sort of thing you take a chance on."  IFPI
offices in Beijing and Shanghai remain open, and Canton office will
go back on line as soon as threat is resolved, she said.  This
isn't first time IFPI has had to shut down office -- in recent
years, threats forced temporary closures in Thailand and Taiwan. 
"We reopened in Taiwan, and now we've cleaned up the market,"
Hughes said.

     While CD-ROM piracy snares spotlight, black market videogame
cartridge activity is soaring.  Almost nonissue as recently as
1988, cartridge piracy is costing publishers at least $1-$1.5
billion annually, said Nintendo of America (NOA) Gen. Counsel Lynn
Hvalsoe.  Aggressive legal efforts have stunted counterfeit sales
in U.S., but unlawful products are rampant in Asia and Latin
America, she said.  At close to 20 million, total number of illegal
Nintendo Super Entertainment System (SNES) consoles in China equals
installed base in U.S.  Estimates of total number of counterfeit
Nintendo cartridges sold in China come to 100 million units or
more, she said.

     CD-ROM and game cartridge pirate situations are fundamentally
different because of media used by 2 formats.  For one, while China
is producer of pirate CD-ROM product, it's primarily consumer of
counterfeit videogames.  There are almost 300 CD-ROM plants
worldwide, but just 12 can produce high-density read-only memory
chips used in videogame cartridges.  Most of those are in Japan, S.
Korea, Taiwan.

     Sophisticated pirates don't just duplicate games, they
reproduce artwork as well, Hvalsoe said.  Difference between
legitimate and pirate box often is little more than lighter
contrast on illegal copy, and sometimes fake name.  That makes
antipiracy activities in developed and undeveloped countries far
more difficult, she said.

     "They copy both trademarked and copyrighted material," Hvalsoe
said.  Getting data out of cartridges is relatively easy;  all it
takes is fairly inexpensive E-PROM or ROM reader.  Nintendo invests
significant amounts of time and money encrypting its games to make
life more difficult for pirates, but such strategies don't work
against determined assault.  "We do have some pretty sophisticated
copy protection," she said, but "we know that no matter how
sophisticated our copy protection is, the pirates will find a way
to get around it."

     There are numerous ways to detect even well-made pirate
product, Hvalsoe said:  (1) Print quality, since even good boxes
are simply copies of old ones.  (2) Product quality, because
pirates often use glue rather than screws to hold game cartridges
together.  (3) Company names, since many suppliers put false names
even on realistic artwork.  (4) Price, since counterfeit cartridges
usually are priced far below legitimate ones.

     Going after chipmakers themselves isn't easy.  Although plants
are few, strategies for disguising chips are many.  Intensive
detective activities are required to ferret out where illegal
copies were made.  Taking action against chip manufacturers also is
difficult.  "We've not had success in Korea or Taiwan suing
people," Hvalsoe said.  So Nintendo is taking advantage of Lanham
Act, which allows companies to sue offshore manufacturers in U.S.
courts if their products are being used illegally.  Most major chip
producers have significant activity and assets in U.S., so actions
taken here can have significant impact overseas, she said.

     Pricing is another defensive strategy.  In China, Nintendo is
selling product "at a significantly reduced value," Hvalsoe said,
with cartridges selling for 50% or more off U.S. price and with
many games going for just $20-$30.  Yet illegitimate games still
win price competition.  In China, taking legal action just doesn't
seem to work, she said.  "When someone's selling hundreds of
thousands of games, they might fine them $100," she said.

     Latin America is another hotbed of pirate sales, Hvalsoe said. 
"We've seen a tremendous amount of activity in Panama and also
Paraguay," she said.  Company is mounting intensive antipiracy
education campaign aimed at Latin American Customs officials. 
Nintendo also is pushing for aggressive legal action against Latin
American pirates.  Hundreds of thousands of cartridges were seized
recently in Panamanian Free Trade Zone.

     Living up to its reputation as intensely litigious company,
Nintendo has several hundred suits pending worldwide, Hvalsoe said. 
Company is working with International Intellectual Property
Alliance and other organizations to try to beat back tide of
unlawful product.  Most successful efforts seem to be in U.S.,
where game piracy seems virtually dormant.

     Even antipiracy action can have twist in China.  China
Foundation for Consumer Protection has created prize to encourage
consumer action against bootleg goods, and recently awarded 5,000
yuan ($600) to Wang Hai.  But award was very controversial, since
many felt Wang was unfairly exploiting China's Law on Protection of
Consumers' Rights and Interests.  That law requires that stores
compensate customers for twice the value of fake products returned. 
Wang was accused of knowingly purchasing fake products and
returning them for double-price refund.

STANDARDIZED TELCO AND CABLE WIRING COMING

     Compatibility between wires used by telcos and cable operators
should be on way soon, thanks to new FCC proceeding.  Commission
launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home wiring rules
between telcos and cable.  Rulemaking will deal with demarcation
between customer-owned and company-owned wiring, signal leakage and
quality, technical standards, customer-premises equipment (CPE),
division of state and federal responsibilities.

     FCC Chmn. Hundt said owning wiring "can be a tremendous
competitive advantage" for incumbent, and new rules could make
cable CPE market as competitive as telephone equipment market.

     Rulemaking seeks comment on:  (1) What demarcation point would
be appropriate, acknowledging it might be different for
single-family and multiple dwelling units.  (2) Whether telcos'
broadband services should have to meet same signal leakage and
signal quality standards as cable.  (3) Whether cable should have
to standardize on jacks to connect CPE to cable system, as telcos
have for telephony.  (4) Whether cable should have same regulatory
distinctions between residential and nonresidential wiring as
telcos.  (5) Whether consumers should have same access to in-home
broadband wiring as they do to telephone wires.  (6) How to divide
regulatory responsibility for wiring among franchise authorities,
states and FCC, and harmonize state and federal regulation of
telephony and video programming.

     FCC tentatively concluded that cable customers should have
same rights to connect their own CPE to cable as telco customers
have.  It said it believes that it may be appropriate to deregulate
cable equipment rates after market becomes competitive and after
transition period.  Rulemaking seeks comment on whether Commission
has authority to deregulate equipment rates.

     Commission rejected petitions for reconsideration filed by
Nynex and others asking to move demarcation point between
customer-owned and operator-owned wiring for multiple dwelling
units.  Comr. Chong said demarcation point, currently 12" outside
subscriber premises, often isn't accessible to competitors, so it
reduces likelihood of competition.  Agency did set rulemaking to
determine whether persons other than individual subscribers should
be able to buy wiring in some circumstances.

16-BIT GAMES HOLD SHARE AMID 64-BIT BATTLES

     "Old-fashioned" 16-bit videogame systems probably will hold on
to major market share even in 1996 as manufacturers wage war of
words, titles and marketing dollars over high-powered new
technology.

     Sparking latest contretemps were comments by 3DO Chmn. William
(Trip) Hawkins that internal "bus" structure of Nintendo Ultra 64
would severely limit performance of system overall and was like
"squeezing a fire hose into a garden hose."

     "That's bull," said Nintendo of America Sales & Mktg. Exec. Vp
Peter Main.  At issue is ability of Nintendo system to move
information from one part of machine to another.  Some portions of
Nintendo machine use 32-bit bus structure.  Hawkins says that will
limit system performance.  Main and Nintendo engineers say it
won't.  What's clear is that 64-bit battles definitely will end up
dominating media coverage and high-end videogame scene -- but
perhaps not dollar volume.

     Introduction of Ultra 64 in Japan is absolute lock for April
21, Main said.  Picture in U.S. is far fuzzier, with potential
launch dates in May-Aug. range.  Some observers are betting on
spring launch themed on Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in L.A. 
If that's to be case, Nintendo will have to resort to some fast ad
footwork.  In visit last week to company's Redmond, Wash., hq, we
were told that no ads had been placed in game fan periodicals, even
though deadlines were drawing near.  Another sign that Ultra may
come later rather than sooner:  Despite flying half-dozen
journalists to Redmond, Nintendo could show only Ultra 64
videotape, not game itself.

     One thing is sure:  1995 was tough year for videogame
industry, Nintendo included.  "This year was called the great year
of confusion," Main said.  One big challenge is that primary
audience -- boys 8-12 years old -- is becoming more choosy than
ever and willing to skip products that don't offer dramatic edge in
performance and game play.  "We're dealing with 8-12-year-olds
acting like 35-40-year-olds in terms of savvy," Main said.  That
has resulted in good and bad news for Nintendo;  software sales
have been strong, but company's new hardware introduction, Virtual
Boy, is struggling so hard that company is planning "relaunch" in
U.S. and Japan.

     "It was the year of hits, not bits," Main said, with winner
determined by "who is going to have the greatest content."  He
pointed to Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country 2 as both hit and good
software product.  "Even while other software is selling at at best
60% to 70% of last year's totals, this one has worldwide demand of
110% to 120%," he said.  One sign that strength of 16-bit market
caught Nintendo as well as most of rest of videogame market by
surprise is the fact that DKC2 is sold out on global basis.  Main
predicted 16-bit strength would continue to lesser degree through
1996.  "At this time next year, [16-bit] is going to represent 35%
to 40% of the videogame market," he said.

     While Donkey Kong may be doing well, rest of videogame market
isn't setting any records.  Projections were that game market would
be down 5% to 20%, Main said.  He thinks total decline will be
10-12%, with U.S. videogame dollar volume at $3.8-$3.9 billion. 
Once counted out, 16-bit products represent 2/3 of that, he said. 
Market share of 16-bit games has declined to 66% of total sales in
1995 from 77% last year.  Hand-held market share also slumped, down
to 15-16% this year from 25% last year.  That still represents
significant volume.  "We've got 19 million Game Boys sold," Main
said.  "This year we'll be moving 5.7 million pieces."

     New technology, including 32-bit games and Virtual Boy,
account for fraction of total market, 19%, Main said.  He estimated
that fewer than one million 32-bit consoles would be sold.  Of that
number, Sony's Playstation accounted for 400,000-500,000, Sega's
Saturn 200,000, 3DO 150,000 and with Atari's Jaguar and other
devices accounting for rest.  By contrast, 16-bit Super Nintendo
Entertainment system sold 2.4 million, he said.  Virtual Boy's
sales were far under expectations, Main admitted:  "It's been a
long year for Virtual Boy in the U.S."  Even though 3D game playing
units have sold far under expectations, "we are not finished with
Virtual Boy," Main said.

     Nintendo has sold 400,000 Virtual Boys in U.S., 250,000 in
Japan, he said.  Games released for unit just scratch surface of
its unique capabilities, Main said.  In Japan, "they are planning
to relaunch the product in February," he said, with similar
relaunch in U.S.  "It has not seen its full potential.  It's going
to have another round."

     One area Nintendo isn't planning to explore is CD-ROM
videogames.  Cost structures in CD-ROM market benefit
manufacturers, not consumers, Main said.  When it comes to adding
bulk memory capacity to Ultra 64, Nintendo will stick with
recordable magnetic disc that company has already announced, he
said.  Disc will move at 8 times CD-ROM speed, he said.  Position
may leave Nintendo vulnerable when DVD hits market, since competing
M-2 and Sony Playstation systems reportedly will be able to play
back DVD discs with relatively simple upgrade.  Signs are that
Ultra 64, with its proprietary magnetic discs, won't have that
capability.

FORMAT WARS LOOM OVER DVD MUSIC CAPABILITIES

     Software and hardware companies are moving to carve out slices
of potentially vast DVD music market.  It looks as though format
war that was avoided over video DVD will erupt on sound side.

     Several entities are exploring DVD music potential -- or
battling for different sound formats.  Engineering Committee of
Recording Industry Assn. of America (RIAA) has formed task force to
investigate applications of high-density music discs, Exec. Vp
David Leibowitz said.  Sony is showing hush-hush technology called
Direct Stream Digital (DSD) that will form backbone of its proposal
for adapting DVD disc for ultra-high-fidelity music applications. 
And Pioneer and Philips are touting their own DVD music solutions.

     Sony claimed DSD will deliver frequency response up to 100 kHz
and dynamic range better than 120dB, on ground that any new music
proposal will have to represent "quantum leap" in sonic performance
from existing CD if it's to succeed.  Sony executives are
describing system as "radical departure" from linear PCM technology
used in existing CD system.  Beauty of DSD, they said, is that
system is "scalable" for variety of future archival or digital
delivery applications.

     DVD discs will hold 100 min. of 2-channel stereo music, Sony
Software Dir.-Sound Technology Mktg. David Kawakami said.  He said
DSD also can be adapted easily for multichannel music-only
applications.  He said Sony is confident 4.7-Gb DVD would be
capable of holding at least 74 min. of multichannel music, same
capacity as existing audio CD.

     Sony DSD proposal already has drawn sharp attacks.  DSD also
is likely to face competition from other proponents such as Philips
and Pioneer, which are developing their own systems.  Little is
known about Philips' PCM-based proposal, which is believed to carry
working name OmniDisc, and puts strong emphasis on multichannel
capabilities.  Pioneer had been floating proposal within SD
Alliance for 2-stage DVD music application, touting 24-bit, 96-kHz
oversampling.

     DSD wasn't only source of DVD music battles.  Dolby Labs
predictably welcomed word that unified DVD format includes AC-3
audio as mandatory standard for NTSC markets and optional system
for PAL and SECAM countries.  But usually staid and conservative
licensor also took opportunity to remove gloves and attack Philips
for week-earlier claims that MPEG audio is "superior" to AC-3 in
sound quality and future upgradability.  In criticizing Philips
claims, Dolby Vp Edward Schummer was referring to report quoting
Philips spokeswoman as saying MPEG has been found to have better
sound quality than AC-3 in comparative listening tests her company
has run.  She also said MPEG audio has future upgradability for
7.1-channel surround.

     Because MPEG multichannel audio decoder chips aren't "readily
available," Dolby said in report, "it is assumed" that consumer
hardware would be based at start on 2-channel devices.  Two-step
strategy of introducing DVD audio as "stereo today, multichannel
tomorrow" means that "limitations" of MPEG audio "can remain
largely unknown until some time in the future, long after the
decision [adopting system for DVD] has been made," Dolby said.

     Choosing DVD audio standard for unified specs once had been
described as "minor issue" when former MultiMedia CD (MMCD) and
Super Density (SD) alliances announced preliminary truce agreement
3 months ago.  However, debate between adopting MMCD-supported MPEG
audio and SD-endorsed AC-3 system appears to have gone down to
wire, reportedly because Philips -- in breaking with Sony -- had
been lobbying heavily, to no avail, for worldwide adoption of MPEG
as mandatory DVD sound system.

     While Dolby was depicting AC-3 as winner in DVD derby, real
loser was DTS, which had ridden Matsushita's coattails and won
designation from now-moot SD Alliance as optional DVD sound system
in NTSC markets along with mandatory choice of AC-3.

HOTELS AND AIRLINES EMERGING AS VIDEOGAME MARKETS

     Systems that allow consumers to play videogames in hotel rooms
and while they're flying are beginning to achieve significant
market penetration.

     At least 200,000 hotel rooms are equipped with game play
capability for Nintendo products alone, said Nintendo of America
(NOA) Engineering Dir. Russel Braun.  Penetration is fairly
significant, since there are about 1.6 million hotel rooms in U.S.,
of which only about 800,000 are in facilities upscale enough to
want to provide gaming service.  "Real discount chains won't want
to add amenities like this," he said.

     Airlines have lot further to go.  About 35,000 seats have game
capability, Braun said, on such airlines as Cathay Pacific,
Singapore Airlines, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, China Air. 
One reason for slower progress:  Cost.  Expense of installing
system comes to about $1.5 million per plane, and weight is equal
to that of 4 passengers.  But payoff can be dramatic -- Cathay
calculated that if it gets just 2 more passengers per plane,
additional revenues will come to $1 million.

     On airplanes, each seat has own screen, mounted using flexible
shaft.  Besides videogames, screens can carry movies and public
service announcements.  Consumer reception so far seems strong,
with one caveat:  Seatmates sometimes object to language used by
struggling game players.

     Instead of selling game services directly to hotels, Nintendo
works through distributors of pay-TV systems.  "They put it in the
hotel and they manage it," Braun said.  Game systems will work only
in hotels with pay-TV systems;  when such systems are installed,
it's possible to get game play technology up and running for only
$35-$50 per room.  That's because system is centralized -- each
room has only game controller, with single main unit handling game
play activity.

     Relatively small game system can handle fairly large hotel,
since in average hotel of 100 rooms only about 20 TV sets will be
on.  Current record for continuous hotel game play:  12 hours at
one stretch.  Bill for play was reportedly far more than bill for
stay, but customer reportedly paid without whimper. 

     Hotels don't pay for installation, pay-TV distributors do. 
Hotels then get 10% of game revenue.  Consumers can select any one
of 10 videogames and pay $4.95 per hour.  Selection can be changed
relatively easily, but switch requires in-person visit by cable
operator.  Most popular Nintendo game is Super Mario World.  Vast
majority of hotel rooms are in U.S., but providers are staging
aggressive push for other countries.  U.K. opened up last month; 
plans are to enter Japan in Jan., with Brazil on list for 1996 as
well.

TOUGH TIMES FOR BIG RETAILERS

     By and large, few retailers cheered holiday season, but stores
that specialized in broader product lines seemed to face most
difficult struggles.  Some chains are trying to make comebacks from
the near dead.  Others are battling to avoid extinction themselves.

     Biggest victim of rough retail era is K mart, which staved off
immediate threat of bankruptcy in late Dec. after reaching
agreement with creditors and eliminating common stock dividend. 
Creditors agreed to delay payments on $548 million in real estate
bonds.  Original terms called for K mart to pay sum back
immediately if its bond rating were cut to junk-bond level. 
Moody's has downgraded K mart senior debt to notch above junk bond. 
Retailer also eliminated 12 cents-per-share quarterly dividend that
could result in saving $220 million yearly.

     Tandy's Incredible Universe (IU) and Computer City (CC) are
expected to post losses this year.  Board authorized buyback of up
to 5 million shares in bid to ward off shareholder discontent
following collapse of stock to $37 from $64.  Tandy has battled to
improve operations of 2 of its chains, CC and IU, latter projected
by analysts to lose $11 million this year.  Stock buyback bid is
Tandy's 2nd following 12.5-million-share program in 1994.

     Another operation trying to make it back from brink is 47th
St. Photo.  Fresh from purchase by Tuttnauer, 47th St. Photo said
it's is planning possible public stock offering to open 2 new
stores in 1996.  N.Y.C. retailer, which will seek listing on
Nasdaq, will use money to open 15,000-sq.-ft. stores in Lower
Manhattan and Long Island, said Tut Services Pres.-CEO Stuart Held,
whose firm is holding company for 47th St.

     Stores would be first that 47th St. Photo has opened since
filing for bankruptcy in 1992.  Since then, chain, which once had
$300 million annual sales, closed 3 stores, including namesake on
47th St., but maintained 45th St. location.

     Plans include boost in PC market presence and catalog sales,
executives said.  47th St. will ship 6 catalogs in 1996 targeting
niches within photography and CE, Held said.  Mail order accounts
for 20% of sales, although plans are to expand it to 30-35%, he
said.  Held projected sales of $50-$60 million in 1996.  Company
also will boost presence in PCs, which represent 28-30% of sales. 
Held said:  "PCs have been ignored up until now because it took so
much money to go into that area, but now that we're starting to
settle our finances we will become aggressive again."

     Still another retailer expanding after trying time is Tops
Appliance City.  Tops, which has battled to bring finances into
line, said it has selected site in Brooklyn to open 60,000-sq.-ft.
store and will shift to full commission for sales staff in early
1996.  Brooklyn store would be N.J. chain's 9th.  Chain also has
sought to boost home office business, adding new fixtures in some
outlets to increase assortment of PC software and peripherals. 
Tops gradually has boosted amount of PC software its stores carry
since 1994 when it moved to 100 titles from 25.

     Experiencing relatively smooth growth is Tower Records, which
just expanded into Canada, opening 22,500-sq.-ft. store in Toronto. 
Store is stocked with 100,000 music CDs, 10,000 videos, laserdiscs
and CD-ROM titles, 14,000 books.  Tower operates 150 stores in 12
countries.

3-D DVD 'WALKMAN'

     A leading manufacturer of virtual reality glasses, Virtual iO,
is working with Matsushita to develop standard interconnections for
DVD portables to be used with eyegear displays for viewing movies
and other programs on the go, including 3D.

     "We're doing some work with DVD," said Linden Rhoads, pres.
and co-founder of Virtual iO, Seattle.  Company's glasses weigh
less than 1 lb. and display images on 0.7" LCD screens about 1"
from viewer's eyes.  Image is surprisingly clear, but also reveals
flaws, with pixels relatively visible.

     Since first shipments 7 months ago, Virtual has sold 40,000
pairs of glasses priced at $799, said Rhoads, who said company
projects sales of "several hundred thousand" in 1996, based on
expectation that cable networks will offer 3D shows next year. 
Video/DVD version of glasses at start will sell for $599, she said,
with prices going "down to $299 over the next couple of years," but
$199 and $99 probably aren't within reach because of costs.

     Rhoads said Virtual is working with Matsushita, which probably
will distribute its glasses in Japan.  Primary goal is to create
uniform plug that will carry audio, video and power over same line. 
As things stand, users would need separate battery pack to power
players and headgear.  Negotiations should result in "simple and
elegant" connector that does whole job with one cable, she said.

     Virtual iO glasses provide rough equivalent of NTSC quality. 
Recent deal with Planar Systems, Rhoads said, will let company make
leap from LCD displays to electroluminescent (EL) technology.  LCD
displays are limited effectively to 60,000 pixels, but EL displays
can make possible 350,000-pixel screen that should be available in
mid-1996, offering full Virtual Graphics Array (VGA) quality
resolution, with 500,000-pixel model on market in about year.

     Virtual iO's investors include TCI, Thomson CSF and Logitech,
Rhoads said, and company has exclusive deal to provide Sony with
virtual reality (VR) glasses for PlayStation, to be shipped in 1996
first quarter, she said.  Glasses will provide full 3D effect for
special 3D games.  Game glasses will feature "head tracking,"
turning images as user turns head, up, down or sideways.

     "Cybersickness" isn't issue, Rhoads said, referring to flaw
that has plagued all 3D video systems in past -- including
dizziness, nausea, headache.  But even some Virtual staffers say
they have experienced twinges with more intense VR games.  Another
potential health hazard -- walking into traffic while wearing
headgear -- won't be problem, she said.  Glasses have see-through
screens, and users are expected to use them while seated in buses,
at home or waiting in line.

     Besides working with CE companies, Virtual is negotiating with
voice recognition supplier, Rhoads said, on system allowing users
to control glasses with words rather than reaching for switch or
control.  When SVGA glasses go on market, she said, they could make
laptop PC screens obsolete.

manufacturer Nichia, based in Tokushima.  Nichia said it has
developed short wavelength blue-violet semiconductor laser stable
at room temperature.  Blue lasers will make it possible to increase
density of data stored on CD-ROMs and other optical media.  Device
also could be used for projection systems.  One potential
challenge:  Fitting short-wavelength technology into longer
wavelength lasers required under new DVD standard.  Gallium nitride
laser has wavelength of 410 nanometers, compared with 635 and 650
designated for laser diodes in unified DVD specs finalized Dec. 8. 
Company said it hopes to start mass production within 2 years, with
DVD as prime application.

     Recognizing weakness of MPEG-1 as consumer product (CMR Oct 30
p1), Philips said it's consolidating CD-I sales and marketing
functions in Washington and shifting focus away from "traditional
retail."  Strategy will be to sell through "small retailers and
alternative types of distribution," including direct marketing,
said Philips N. America CD-I Mktg. Vp Gail Wellington.  Philips
Professional Media Pres. John Gray will head new operation in
Washington, not yet named, while Philips Media keeps office in
L.A., she said.  New plans don't involve leaving consumer market,
although Wellington conceded company "probably won't be as active
with national advertising."  Philips will continue direct marketing
to current CD-I owners, expanding it to offer software from
publishers other than Philips Media.  New avenues include
CD-I-based Internet browser that will be available in U.S. in 6-9
months.  Browser, introduced in PAL version in U.K. in Sept., is
modem and software combination that includes 14.4 kbps modem that
plugs into CD-I player.  CD-I disc has communications software and
browser.

GERMAN AUTHORITIES DENY FORCING COMPUSERVE BAN

German authorities say that CompuServe decided on its own last
week to bar its 4 million subscribers worldwide from accessing
some 200 sexually explicit Internet newsgroups.

In addition, German prosecutors said that they never explicitly
threatened CompuServe with criminal action.

The denials follow CompuServe's announcement last Thursday that
it had blocked access systemwide to the newsgroups in question
"in response to a direct mandate from the prosecutor's office in
Germany."

In its statement, CompuServe said: "Each of the newsgroups that
was suspended was specifically identified to CompuServe by the
German authorities as illegal under German criminal law."

Munich senior public prosecutor Manfred Wick said Tuesday his
office did not provide CompuServe with any such list as part of
its investigation of child pornography on the Internet. He also
said prosecutors did not threaten CompuServe with criminal
charges.

"We did not make any stipulations. It was the decision of
CompuServe alone," he told The Associated Press.

However, Wick released a statement Wednesday saying police asked
CompuServe to "scrutinize" a list of more than 200 newsgroups
last month.

"The decision on whether and to what extent the groups on the
list would be blocked was left to CompuServe," the statement
said.

"The newsgroups were specifically identified by German
officials," said a CompuServe spokeswoman in Columbus, OH. She
added that CompuServe's legal department was in talks with
prosecutors "and that is something that is going to have to be
hashed out."

As for the threat of legal action, the spokeswoman said: "We got
some information from (German prosecutors) that there was a real
possibility of arrest if we didn't comply."

Wick said German state police will release their findings by mid-
February as to what material available on computer networks can
be considered criminal and what effect that can have on online
services.

He said German authorities consider online services legally
responsible for information found on their networks, even if the
information comes from outside the networks--as is the case with
Internet newsgroups.

WESTINGHOUSE RAISES ANOTHER $3 BILLION TO PAY FOR CBS

Westinghouse Electric Corp., raising cash to help pay for its
$5.4 billion acquisition of CBS, says it has sold its defense
and electronic systems businesses to Northrop Grumman Corp. for
$3 billion.

Northrop Grumman will take on another $600 million in pension
liabilities in the deal.

Westinghouse said that broadcasting will now account for 45% of
its approximately $10 billion in sales and almost two-thirds of
its earnings.

Westinghouse earlier agreed to sell its Knoll Group office
furniture business for about $565 million.

The company said proceeds from the sales will enable it to pay
down more than 65% of its CBS debt.

The sale is expected to close during the first quarter following
normal government reviews, the company said.

Westinghouse also makes refrigeration equipment, nuclear energy
systems and power generators. It also operates government and
electronic systems businesses.

Wall Street was pleased with the price Northrop paid--
Westinghouse closed up $1.25 at $18.375 in Wednesday trading.

AT&T BACKING OFF PROPRIETARY ONLINE TECHNOLOGY

AT&T has signaled that it may move away from the proprietary
software it developed for its online services in favor of
technology that has made the Internet's World Wide Web
accessible to millions.

In a press release Tuesday announcing the elimination of 40,000
jobs, AT&T said it plans to modify "several of the company's
online services to Internet-based technical platforms and modify
some of its messaging services, which will require writing down
the value of some proprietary software and hardware."

AT&T operates the Interchange Online Network, a traditional
online service, PersonalLink, a messaging system, and the
ImagiNation game network. All require use of proprietary client
software.

Interchange boss Michael Kolowich did not return a telephone
call seeking comment, but a source close to the operation said
Interchange will be "moving toward a more open standard." AT&T's
press release did not indicate how long it would take to make
any changes.

The source said the job cuts will not affect the 300 employees
at AT&T New Media Services in Cambridge, MA, where Interchange
is based.

AT&T, which purchased Interchange in December 1994 from Ziff
Communications, integrated the Netscape browser software into
the service in October. While Interchange can be accessed
directly from the Internet, users still must use the Interchange
software.

Meanwhile, Gartner Group, a technology advisory firm in
Stamford, CT, that provides information on the Interchange
network, said it will introduce a Web site for its @vantage
service, which offers insights on technology. Gartner said the
site will begin operation in the second quarter.

Asked if the Web site would undercut the Interchange network,
Gartner spokeswoman Kate Berg said there "is a potential
situation...but the center of gravity is the Internet."

AT&T's Interchange offers access to various online newspapers,
including the Washington Post's Digital Ink, the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis and the New Haven, CT Journal Register, as well as Z-
D Interactive and the AT&T Business Network.

AMERITECH DISPUTES TIME WARNER STATEMENT

Ameritech says it disputes a Time Warner statement that
negotiations between the two companies about offering competing
local telephone services in Ohio have been unsuccessful.

The Baby Bell said Time Warner's real motive may be a negative
publicity campaign, perhaps to delay finalization of Ameritech's
cable TV franchise agreement in Columbus.

Last week, Time Warner, stepping up its efforts to enter the
local phone service business, asked state regulators in Ohio to
intervene in its negotiations with Ameritech on plans to offer a
competing local service.

Time Warner said that Ameritech was either unable or unwilling
to reach an agreement to provide connections on calls from Time
Warner's proposed network. The two companies began talks in
December 1994.

In a statement, Ameritech said the negotiations have actually
produced substantive agreements on many technical and economic
issues but that new issues and demands raised by Time Warner
have delayed finalization of a complete agreement.

"The combination of Time Warner raising new issues at the
bargaining table, publicly complaining to the PUCO (Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio), and conducting a media blitz
seems to be a tactic to create negative publicity and may be an
attempt to stall finalization of our cable TV franchise
agreement in Columbus," said James C. Smith, Ameritech Ohio VP.

"They seem more intent on delaying competition in the cable TV
market than negotiating seriously to resolve issues so they can
provide local telephone service."

Ameritech said it wants to resume negotiations and resolve the
latest set of issues raised by Time Warner. Ameritech said it
believes that a final interconnection agreement can be reached
on all remaining issues.

DOW JONES SERVICE OFFERS ACCESS TO NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLES

Subscribers to the Dow Jones News/Retrieval business information
service can now access full-text archives of The New York Times
for the most recent 90-day period.

North American customers can also tap into collections of Times
articles organized by topic, dating back to 1981.

Dow Jones subscribers outside North America will be able to
access the full archives dating back to 1980. Both North
American and overseas customers will have access to abstracts of
articles dating back to 1969.

For many years, Lexis/Nexis, then owned by Mead Data Central,
had exclusive access to archive stories from The Times. Upon the
sale of Mead to Reed Elsevier in October 1994 for $1.5 billion,
the long-term contract was renegotiated, allowing The Times to
sell those rights to others.

PEOPLE: MONEY MAGAZINE FIRES DAN DORFMAN

Money magazine says it has fired financial columnist and TV
commentator Dan Dorfman because he refused to tell its managing
editor who his sources were.

Dorfman has been on a paid leave of absence from the Time Inc.
publication since October when a Business Week magazine report
said federal authorities were investigating his relationship
with a frequent source of tips as part of an insider-trading
probe.

Money managing editor Frank Lalli said in a statement that
Dorfman was fired Monday.

"The serious issues raised about Dorfman and his sources
convinced me that I had to know his sources for his Money
columns," Lalli said. "I needed that information to maintain my
confidence in the quality of the information we publish. Dorfman
declined to tell me who his sources were."

Dorfman had been hired by Money in late 1994 and began writing
his columns in January 1995. He is widely known for his regular
reports on CNBC and previously as a columnist for USA Today.

CNBC, which continued to air Dorfman's regular reports after he
was put on leave by Money, said it was standing by him.

"We believe that a presumption of guilt coupled with a blanket
request for all sources could have a chilling effect on the
ability of journalists to do their jobs and protect the public
interest," the cable channel said in a statement.

It added it had no reason to believe Dorfman had violated any
law or failed to adhere to the standards of the company.

"Under these circumstances, CNBC has no reason to follow Money
magazine's approach in demanding that Mr. Dorfman disclose the
identify of all his sources," it said.

In a story on the firing that aired after Dorfman's scheduled
segment Wednesday, CNBC quoted Dorfman as saying that Time Inc.
had made demands on him that "no responsible reporter can
accept," requiring him to disclose the names of every
confidential source for every story that had appeared in the 10
columns that he wrote for Money.

He also noted that he was not asked for the identity of his
sources before the columns were published. He added that he has
asked his attorney to begin arbitration proceedings.

Dorfman, who had reportedly been signed to a six-figure contract
with Money, has previously denied any wrongdoing.

PEOPLE: DISNEY HIRES PREMIERE MAGAZINE EDITOR AS VP

Walt Disney Co., seeking to focus more attention on writers and
publishers in New York, says it has hired Premiere magazine
founder Susan Lyne as an executive VP at its motion picture
group.

Lyne, 45, who has been Premiere's editor-in-chief since the
title's founding in 1987, will be the studio's most senior
creative executive in New York.

She will be in charge of the acquisition of books, screenplays
and stage plays, and the development of intellectual material
and new opportunities.

"This is an entirely new position created to take advantage of
Disney's expanded reach," said Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group
chairman Joe Roth.

Lyne led Premiere under a number of different owners, playing an
important role in the sale of the magazine in May to a joint
venture of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines and Ron Perelman's New
World Communications Group.

It had been owned since 1991 by K-III Communications Corp.

Hachette Filipacchi Magazines said that Christopher Connelly,
one of Lyne's lieutenants at Premiere, will become its new
editor.

IT'S HERE! IBM FORMALLY ANNOUNCES SATCONNECT SERVICE

IBM has finally announced the official existence of
its IN Satconnect service in Europe, much to the
chagrin of the other satellite network operators who
are keeping a somewhat discrete silence over the
whole affair.

After many months of waiting and broken internal
deadlines, IBM executives have allowed news of the
new service to become officially released.  Many
software revisions and internal quality assurance
certifications contributed towards the internal
delays.  Many observers who have seen the system
believe that the IBM-induced delays were worthwhile.

The system has been announced in Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland and the UK.

Data transmission rates of 9.6kbit/s to 2mbit/s can
be attained through the new 'digital pipe'.  The
"general availability" date is slated for 30
September 1993.  Countries will be free to set their
own dates.

Typically IBM expects one bit in two billion (10 to
the power of 10) to be corrupted at the downlink.
Error correction significantly reduces this
occupance.

IN SatConnect is designed to be operated
independently of other telecommunications networks,
although it can be linked with the existing IBM
Information Network services like the IBM Information
Exchange EDI service to collect data. With the
system, the information provider will link into IBM's
network to transmit data for distribution. Receive
sites will use conventional VSAT hardware combined
with IBM PCs and custom-designed hardware. VSAT
receivers as small as 80cm can be used in the centre
of the Eutelsat satellite's footprint.

Signal security is a key feature of IN SatConnect,
and advanced data masking technology has been
included to provide integrity for transmitted data.
As the system is digitally-based, video, audio and
data can be merged and transmitted securely.

Data can be scheduled so that it is broadcast at a
set time even though it has been loaded by the
information provider onto the transmission system in
advance. Real time data throughput will be supported
on the system during 1994 once a second release of
software is made during December 1993.  IBM is
presently attempting to attract "batch broadcasters"
who wish to send large files to multiple locations
rather than the continuous small-file feed companies.

Real time feeds are considered an important business
area and they will be approached once a steady stream
of customers has been found.

The information provider is charged for connection to
the SatConnect service. There is an initial charge of
GBP3,552 and an annual charge of GBP13,331 for the
transfer of 500 megabytes of data.  Further use is
charged according to a tariff.  Receive sites cost
GBP1,068 initially with a GBP720 annual charge
thereafter.  Under the existing IBM discount scheme,
existing IN users can achieve discounts up to 40
percent of standard tariff guides, bringing the costs
down significantly in the process.

IBM has signed an agreement with Comstream Corp. to
market and distribute its satellite receiver
equipment.  Although IBM is not making the use of
Comstream equipment mandatory, thus allowing the
potential use of plug-compatible equipment, Comstream
equipment will be marketed as a "complimentary non-
IBM product" and will feature in all promotional and
sales literature.

The Comstream DBR401 multi-function satellite
broadcast receiver and LNB are provided under the
marketing agreement.

One feature of the IBM network is that bandwidth can
be changed "over the air" in accordance with users'
needs.  The DBR401 receiver will have four pre-
selected data rates programmed as standard reducing
the requirement for field maintenance.

Data sent to the receiving PS/2 computer can
immediately be routed to a LAN server or mainframe if
required, thus freeing local receiver resources and
permitting the prompt processing of data.

* Minimum system requirements for the PS/2 receiver
are: MCA-based bus; 20MHz clock speed; 8MB RAM; slot
for IN card; RS-232 port; OS/2 version 1.3 standard
edition or OS/2 version 2.0

FIRST UNION EXPANDS DATA NETWORK

First Union Corporation, a Charlotte, NJ, USA-based
commercial company has extended its contract with GTE
Spacenet to continue the provision of a Skystar VSAT
network.  The new contract, valid for five years,
will see over 300 new terminals brought on-stream
taking the network capacity to around 1100.

The company is using the additional terminals to
connect new locations in the Maryland, Washington DC
and Virginia areas.

"The Skystar network provides the speed and
reliability our branches need to provide our
customers with the best possible service.   The
network has also helped facilitate our growth through
mergers and acquisitions because we are able to get
new sites on-line quickly and to continue to deliver
the highest quality of customer service possible
throughout the First Union system," said George
Mattingly, senior vice president and director of
telecommunications at First Union.

"Our VSAT network has survived two hurricanes and an
ambitious expansion program while providing
significant cost savings compared to terrestrial
alternatives."

A spokesman for GTE Spacenet said that First Union is
one of its most demanding customers and attempts to
satisfy their requirements has in turn germinated
other benefits for Skystar customers generally.

In 1988 First Union became the first bank in the US
to use high-speed satellite-based communications in
its branch banking network.  The network supports
branch automation and transaction processing of ATMS,
video broadcasts and training systems.

First Union awarded GTE its "Supplier of the Year"
award recently out of over 18,000 suppliers in
recognition of the service, says
the company.

COMSTREAM KIT HEADS EAST FOR SHANGHAI SE

The Shanghai Stock Exchange has signed a contract
with Comstream Corp for two parallel 1000 site
satellite networks to broadcast digital data and
audio to SSE member brokers.

Under the massive contract, the Shanghai Scientific
and Technical Development Company will conduct
installation and operation of the network.  Eight
installation teams are already installing equipment,
and many more are to be taken on to ensure that the
network is completed by October.

Comstream DBR401 digital data receivers and ABR200
digital audio receivers will be installed at broker
offices throughout China, and the network will
transmit real time stock information and prices while
the audio circuit will carry profiles of traded
companies, analysis of stock trading and business
news. In the downtime, 'background' music will be
broadcast.

The Shanghai Metals Exchange has also signed a
contract with Comstream for the provision of a much
smaller network.  Under the SME contract, 52
locations will be connected to the network by the end
of July.

The data networks will operate at 19.2kbit/s with
full redundancy and diversity as standard.

WHAT IS A VSAT SAYS US DEPT. OF COMMERCE

After being asked "What is a VSAT?" by the US
Department of Commerce as part of an investigation
into alleged trading misdemeanours, Satellite
Technology Management is holding consultations to
resolve technical questions raised over the
exportability of a STM designed and built
telecommunications system in Iran.

The Department of Commerce has classified a VSAT
system to be a commercial communications network
eligible for export to Iran without prior US
government approval, but the Commerce Department has
investigated recent shipments made by STN to Iran,
and agents raided offices seizing papers (DBN
passim).

STM points out that Iran currently has two US-built
VSAT systems in operation, with the largest network
provided by Hughes Network Systems for the
Telecommunications Company of Iran.  STM has supplied
the second, smaller network to the Iranian national
broadcasting organisation to demonstrate VSAT
applications to commercial entities such as the
Central Bank of Iran.

Following on from the demonstration, STM is now
battling against AT&T, GTE and Hughes to win the
lucrative contract conservatively valued at US$15
million.

A VSAT system ordered in December 1992 by Iran
Electronic Industries (IEI) under a US$1.4 million
contract is presently held at US docks after shipment
was stopped by customs officials.  The system was
destined for use within a shared hub using Intelsat-
leased transponder segment.

The problem now facing STM is to prove exactly what a
VSAT is, and confirm to Department of Commerce
officials that there is nothing untoward about the
shipment that could contravene US technology export
restrictions.

EURO VSAT MARKET SET TO RISE--REPORT

CIT Research's annual Satellite Communications in
Europe report for 1993 has just been released, and it
forecasts that the total market for satellite
business services will be almost ECU1.2 billion by
2002, with the facilities management of two-way VSAT
networks and services accounting for 24 percent of
revenues.

The rise in takeup for VSAT services will rise with
the market developing in many diverse ways.  VSAT
services are likely to be used foremost in the UK,
Germany and France -- countries noted for their
'awareness' to VSAT operators' needs -- and by 2001
there would be an estimated 19,000 one-way VSAT
terminals installed and around 15,000 two-way VSAT
terminals.   This number still pales into
insignificance when compared to North America or the
Far East.

CIT says that during 1992, as in 1991, Germany was
the largest market for VSAT services with the
presence of four network operators, and Italy
continues to be experiencing steady, firm growth. The
UK's market has consolidated following the sale of
British Aerospace Communications, and the often lack
lustre performance of its own incumbent operators.

HUGHES LAUNCH VOICE VSAT PRODUCT AT AT93

Hughes Network Systems has launched a new VSAT
product designed to provide small, remote business
locations with a high-grade data and voice
communications service at a lower price than
comparable systems.  The launch was made at the
recent Asia Telecom show in Singapore.

The new PhoneLINK single channel telephony system is
a by-product of HNS' Telephony Earth Station -- a
product designed to offer full mesh connectivity and
toll quality voice transmissions without a network
hub -- and PhoneLINK will draw heavily on TES'
construction.

PhoneLINK can be connected into a TES network, and
provides point-to-point or point-to-multipoint
communications using Demand Assigned Multiple Access
(DAMA) and voice activation to minimise recurring
satellite usage charges.

Paul Gaske, HNS vice president for international
satellite networks, said; "PhoneLINK builds on the
tremendous acceptance of the Telephony Earth Station
for remote satellite telecommunications.  With the
new technology, industries worldwide can gain
affordable basic phone and data service to their
remote locations."

COVENTRY SET TO BE TELETEXT CAPITAL OF WORLD?

Continuous research work at the Coventry University
may be keeping the idea and concept of teletext in
the public eye.

W J Overington of the Coventry University's
Management Division, has already published a series
of papers on teletext formats and telesoftware, and
it was much of his pioneering work which led to the
system and standard being implemented in the United
Kingdom.

A new system, known as Telescontext, has now been
proposed which could lead to audio subcarrier
broadcasts being used in conjunction with teletext-
like transmissions.  A discussion and proposal paper
was released to members of the UK academic community
late in May.

The system relies upon broadcasters manually
synchronising the start of audio with the start of a
teletext multipage sequence, such as a demonstration
or advertisement.  It could also be used to provide
on-screen representation of a live event, such as
sports results or elections.  Using telescontext
would enable the user to access a lot more
information while listening to a continuous audio
feed.

One of the key differences of Telescontext against
standard teletext is that the audio can be totally
separate from the television broadcast.  A lot of the
preparatory work has been based around satellite
transmissions because of the availability of audio
subcarriers, but the process could equally be used on
a terrestrial system using either broadcast offsets
of pseudo-digital transmissions.

"I recently caught the end of a television news item
about using teletext to send out live reports of the
live chess championship matches.  It has occurred to
me that if such a teletext feed could be supplied to
an Astra broadcaster that has teletext, a live sound
commentary could be provided as well using an audio
subcarrier channel.  Indeed if two or more audio
subcarrier channels were used, the live commentary
could be in several languages such as Eurosport does
with cycling and other sports, each of four
commentators speaking in one language on a separate
audio subcarrier."

NEWS IN BRIEF

Maxat has confirmed its contract with ICV as
exclusively revealed in the last issue of DBN.  ICV
has signed a multi-year contract with Maxat for
Eutelsat II-F4 SMS capacity with a comprehensive
redundancy package.  A secondary uplink will be
located at ICV's headquarters.  David Taylor,
managing director at ICV, said: "The result of this
satellite network will be  better quality service to
TOPIC 3 customers, backed up by the security of

operator, to install and manage ten VSAT stations for
the new economic data service of LUSA, the Portugese
press agency.  By the end of 1994 the network is set
to expand up to over 150 locations.

The European Space Agency has held the first
ESA/European Centre for Space Law meeting and
workshop on intellectual property rights in outer
space on May 26.  IPR in outer space is a legal area
which will gather importance in the near future
because of the increased amount of space exploration
flights and subsequent masses of data.

A virus has been carried over the Channel Videodat
teletext VBI data service in Germany. The "Tremor"
virus attached itself to PKUNZIP, a PC compression
program and version 104 of Mcfee's Anti-Virus
software -- a package which cannot detect Tremor.
Around 60,000 people have signed up for Videodat
services, but it is unknown how any people have been
infected.

Countrywide Communications says that it decided not
to re-pitch for the BT Visual and Broadcast Services'
massive PR account despite having good relations with
the client and conducting business for other business
units involved with satellite.  After a four-way
pitch the account, worth a rumoured GBP75-100,000, went
to Infopress in London.  Meanwhile sources say that
BT is close to landing a new business television
customer, its first in a long time, for a yet unnamed
client.

Reuters America Inc. and Variety Inc. have formed a
new newswire aimed at covering the international
entertainment industry.  The service will be relayed
by satellite and existing terrestrial circuits
initially in North America, although the service will
be rolled out into Europe and the Asia Pacific
regions in the future it is understood.

Scientific Atlanta has introduced a new receiver-
decoder that can handle up to 20 compressed video
signals over a 45mbit/s trunk line. Although the new
D9700 unit is being aimed at cable companies, it will
be able to handle video and data.  IDB Communications
has already signed a contract with SA for use within
its Russian distribution system.

In a separate move, Mainstream Data has announced a
Microsoft Windows version of its Mainstream Newscast
PC front end system, and the first user demonstration
was held at Windows World in Atlanta, USA at the end
of May.   A new MAC product, known as MACWIRE, has
also been launched to filter news carried over the
network. It will be premiered at NEXPO in New Orleans
on 14 June.

Reports say that the rooftop to rooftop satellite
link between the Press Association offices in London,
UK and Polycom in Paris, France is working well.  Two
1.8 metre dishes at the PA are linked to a 3.7 metre
terminal in Paris for data transfer.

Polycom says that it is still on schedule for the
implementation of its two-way VSAT service (Ku and C
band) in Europe by February 1994.  Agence France
Presse is reportedly to be the first customer with a
30 terminal network.

Sources at Channel Four Television in the UK suggest
that a subsidiary company -- Channel Four
Communications -- is considering the launch of a
Usenet by terrestrial data broadcasting feed in the
future.

Maxat is reportedly signing up two customers in
readiness for its two-way VSAT venture with Hughes
Network Systems, as exclusively revealed in DBN
recently.

VSAT IN EUROPE -- REPORT

Delegates attending the VSAT '93 conference in London
recently heard that even with a lot of European
Commission assistance and patronage, European
businesses are failing to maximise the full potential
of satellite communications services for pan-European
trading.

Hans Schoof, of the DGXIII satellite services section
of the European Commission said that the EC would
continue to act in its bid to see a free and level
trading market, particularly in the fraught satellite
services sector.

"There is a general lack of user awareness of
satellite services and European telecommunications
manufacturers are not very willing to take risks and
use VSAT networks," said Schoof, pointing out that
there is a very fragmented and unconsolidated
marketing structure for European satellite
communications.

A generally-poor fixed-line telecommunications
infrastructure in Eastern and Central Europe has seen
a growth in demand by emerging businesses for VSAT
services, with banks and news agencies being the
initial primary users of VSAT services.  In Germany
VSATs were popular after the reunification of East
and West Germany, and were extensively employed by
'West' German companies to link-up offices in the new
'Eastern Lands.'

Jon Collins, the outspoken and well-respected
managing director of AT&T Tridom Europe, pointed out
that there have been a lot of positive developments
in the marketplace over the past five years, and that
demand will continue to rise.

"The tremendous possibilities in central and Eastern
Europe are clear, and it is significant that in
Germany new legislation specifically encouraged the
use of satellite networks to overcome the problems of
limited infrastructure."

There will always be a place for terrestrial
telecommunications infrastructure, and companies such
as AT&T Tridom readily realise and accept this. "VSAT
is not going to replace all of a company's network.
It will be driven by certain applications.  It needs
to be case and cost-justified.  I am not forecasting
explosive growth [for VSAT], but I am genuinely
optimistic that we have finally turned the corner in
the European VSAT market," said Collins.

Chris Bell, head of Unisource Satellite Services
(USS), formerly known as Vesatel, believes that
Eastern European and CIS countries will act as an
important driver for new VSAT systems orders, even
though the average 'terminals per network' ratio will
be lower.

According to Bell, VSATs provide an ideal network
infrastructure for establishing a full range of
telecommunications services in areas with poorly
developed or unreliable communications, such as the
developing countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
But Europe has a long way to go before satellite
networks are as  successful as those operated in the
United States.

"A VSAT network can be installed within weeks and at
a relatively low cost. Eastern Europe and Central
Europe are almost without exception faced with poor
telecomms," said Bell.

Many industry commentators have often noted that
smaller VSAT networks are not economically viable,
and at times network operators have failed to
understand the economics of providing comparatively-
smaller VSAT networks.

In Western countries 150-300 terminal networks are
often the norm, but in areas with a poor
telecommunications infrastructure, a 20-50 terminal
location or even a dedicated point-to-point satellite
communications link can prove to be economically
viable, especially where economic regeneration and
exports are concerned.

Delegates and speakers at the conference agreed that
further moves in deregulation were an essential and
good thing, and that greater emphasis should be
placed on integrated, pan-European network in the
future.

Spot Color


For many magazines, it's too much of
a good thing.

By John Johanek

At one time or another we've all been
exposed to the effects of that deadly
combination of bad taste and too much
money. You know -- that house up the
road with just a few too many
turrets, the evening gown laden with
sequins and rhinestones, or maybe
it's that magazine you subscribe to
with its garish color.

Whether publishers feel they're
getting their money's worth or
(sadly) whether they actually believe
this reflects good design, many
magazines don't seem to know where to
draw the line when it comes to color.

Some publications have a natural
curbing device -- budgets. Depending
on the arrangement you have with your
printer, color costs typically
parallel usage. And magazines that
keep an eye on such excesses will
naturally tighten the purse strings
on rampant color, forcing the
designer to be more selective about
its application.

But, for those without such built-in
constraints, the need for critical
color sensibilities becomes
paramount. Here are some simple
guidelines.

Don't Let Spot Color Upstage Four
Color

When a magazine has the benefit of
glorious photography or top-notch
illustration, designers should let
those elements be the stars.
Frequently, the images will benefit
 that remain solid black. Trying to
tie in a color from the image onto
the larger type will likely cause the
type to compete with the image (or
images) for importance.

If you need to give type more
importance on the page, try other
options like making the type larger
or designing it into a higher
position on the page. In some cases,
making the type bolder will also
work.

Be Selective About Spot Color

If you must use color in a layout,
limit the application. Find a place
you want the reader to go first, then
put that item in color. Instead of
doing an entire headline in color,
highlight just one key word. This
will also let readers determine the
content of the story more quickly.
Drop caps are another popular
candidate for color. When using them,
you'll be more successful when the
headline is short and large. That way
the drop cap can still play a
secondary role in the design even
though it's in color.

Sometimes the best use of spot color
is something as incidental as a band
or rule that will bring the reader's
eye to the part of the page or spread
where you've placed important text,
like a subhead or pull quote. The
important thing to remember is that
color will attract attention when
used sparingly. Be sure there's
something worth seeing when you draw
the reader to a point on the page.

Use Solid Versions with Tints

When tinting sidebars or screening
large type, it's wise to also use the
tint color in full strength somewhere
on the page. Tints alone can often
smack of weak print quality, but when
that color is also a solid, there's
no question about the intent of the
 This approach works well for sidebars
that have a screen covering the box
while the border and headline are
printed in a solid. Another variation
is to print the sidebar box as a
solid color, then knock the type out
of the solid. When doing this, go
back into the headline and make it a
10 or 20 percent tint of the box.
It's best to limit this treatment to
short sidebars. No one will want to
read a large mass of knock-out type.

Avoid Critical Registration

Don't expect too much from your
printer. Printing small type or fine
rules is difficult to keep in
register. If you elect to print a
fine box rule in color, limit it to
one of the base colors like magenta
or cyan. Boxes are especially
difficult because they require both
horizontal and vertical registration.
Likewise, typography -- even large
type -- will challenge the most
skilled printer when the final color
calls for tint combinations to align
on especially thin diagonal strokes
or delicate serifs.

 . . .MORE. . .


Use Appropriate Color

Some designers tend to select colors
in a void, ignoring the underlying
message certain colors (or
combinations) convey. Just as red and
green will surely conjure up images
of Christmas, other colors project
moods and reflect attitudes. Wise
designers will work this to their
advantage, using blood red to infer
terror or a cool blue to suggest
winter.

More importantly, be careful that the
color you've selected isn't sending
out an inappropriate signal to the
reader. Businesslike subjects call
for reserved colors. If your
editorial content needs to be taken
 use serious colors when you want the
message to be playful.

Using color effectively walks the
reader through stories in much the
same way as images and type do -- the
big blast comes at the beginning of
the story and gradually tapers off as
it progresses. Color may, in fact,
drop off to nothing by the end of the
story. This not only allows the next
new feature to have more impact, but
also lets readers unwind as they move
through a story.

Smart designers will also use color
to unify the pages of a story or
several stories as a section. A
distinctive color on each spread of a
story will serve to unite them. This
is even more effective when the color
appears similarly throughout the
pages, such as in the type or band of
an overline that's in the same
position on each spread, or as the
tint color on all sidebars, or when
all pull quotes are the same color.
On sections, bands that bleed in from
the top of each page or color icons
on the opener of each story can pull
the stories together.

Use a Little Gray Matter

For magazines limited to black and a
second color, don't overlook the
value of combining the color with
gray tints. Adding a touch of gray to
a tint of red will change it from
pink to mauve. Gray working with a
screen of yellow can create a rather
unique and pleasing putty color --
just right for a sidebar. Various
combinations of gray and cyan can
result in rich, businesslike tones.
Not only will this avoid the monotony
of repetitive color, it's also a way
to take the edge off raw, harsh
colors.

Avoid Flooding Color

Perhaps the biggest abuse of color is
 give them the appearance of colored
paper stock. Rare is the situation
that warrants this treatment. Quite
simply, avoid it until you feel
you've mastered the craft of
designing with color.

Color is the designer's best friend
when used correctly. In the wrong
hands, however, it can be your
readers' worst nightmare.

The Status of Print


Are printed magazines a dying breed?
Are electronic magazines the wave of
the future . . . or, perhaps, even of
the present?

By Jack Powers

Every page delivered on disk, on-
line, or on demand is a page that is
no longer produced on press. As new
media grows, old media shrinks and
adapts to a changing communications
environment.

 --What is the future of print in the
Information Age?
 --How will it evolve to meet rising
expectations and changing demands?
 --Will batch printing be replaced by
customized, on-demand xerography?
 --And what will happen to all those
professionals who make their livings
crafting paper pages?

Here are some thoughts on the status
of today's print media:


New computing, communications and
imaging technologies have automated
most of the print production
business. Word processing, desktop
publishing, computer graphics,
electronic photography and digital
imaging have eliminated most prepress
jobs. Laser-to-plate systems, digital
printing presses, color laser
printers and in-line finishing
equipment are pushing automation into
the pressroom and bindery. Publishers
are living most of the production
manager's dream of workflow "from
brain to mouse to press," and it's
easier than ever before to make more
print.

Nobody Wants More Print

Except for the people who sell paper
and ink, nobody in the developed
world wants more print, more
"information" dumped on our desks
every morning that we never get a
chance to read, more magazines piling
up on the floor awaiting recycling
day, more catalogs that go directly
from the mail box to the trash.
What we need -- what publishers are
striving to create -- is better
print, more effective publication,
and these days that might mean
ink-on-paper, toner-on-paper or
pixels-on-screen. Instead of a single
pressrun of a million impressions,
buyers are asking for ten pressruns
of a hundred-thousand each and many
are shooting for a hundred-thousand
pressruns of ten impressions each.

Printing Belongs to the Industrial
Age

Conventional printing (along with
broadcast television) typifies the
batch manufacturing approach of the
Industrial Revolution: a single
standardized product produced in vast
quantities with terrific economies of
scale and constantly improving
process efficiencies.
 processing nirvana in which every
cylinder of every press is churning
out perfect pages 24 hours a day, 7
days a week for a single customer, a
house account, who pays -- every
Friday -- in cash. New technologies
like desktop publishing, image
processing and digital prepress have
dramatically improved the efficiency
of batch printing and at the same
time made smaller batches more
affordable.

Interactive Media Belongs to the
Information Age

Advances in computing, communications
and imaging technologies improve the
targeting of publications. On the
creative side, electronic design and
production tools make more
customized, more timely and more
economical page forms. On the
distribution side, new media formats
make the delivery of the publication
better, faster and cheaper. Smart
publishers in every industry segment
are crafting a new generation of
interactive publications that tune
themselves uniquely to the needs of
the "Audience of One." (Some printers
are expanding into new media
services, some of which make money.)

The Costs of Conventional Paper-based
Publishing are Rising

Print is getting more expensive and
losing its competitive edge to
alternative media.

 --Paper costs are rising rapidly and
may never return to their historical
lows since demand from the developing
world is increasing and pressure from
environmental groups opposed to paper
mills is strong worldwide.
 --Distribution costs (including
postage) are based on constantly
increasing labor and energy costs and
will never get any cheaper.
 --Out-of-date information costs,
which don't show up on many
 publishers in all segments.

The Expectations of Readers are also
Rising

Now that nearly every literate person
has used a computer, a revolution of
rising expectations is sweeping the
publishing markets. These new
expectations cover both the editorial
and the commercial aspects of
publication.

 --Readers expect faster turnaround
to compete with electronic media.
 --They prefer the searchability of
interactive products to the dead
weight of paper.
 --They like the superior
illustration opportunities of
multimedia.
 --They expect to pay-per-view for
the information they need rather than
subscribe to pages they may never
use.

There are Three Kinds of Publishers
and Three Kinds of Publications.

Defined by their environments and
their audiences, publishing
operations fall into three broad
classes:

 --Commercial publishers print for
profit and produce newspapers,
magazines, books and other products
which generally carry a price tag.
 --Corporate publishers create pages
for advertising, marketing, corporate
communications, technical
documentation and collateral material
that they usually give away for free.
 --Government publishers in federal,
state and local divisions generate
mountains of legislative, regulatory
and judicial documents that are paid
for by our tax money.

Defined by their intended use, most
publications do predominantly one of
three things, although most pages
contain all three in varying
  --Inform readers with breaking news,
analysis, reference data,
specifications, prices and other
facts.
 --Entertain audiences with stories,
novels, poems, jokes, gossip and
other forms of narrative.
 --Persuade prospects with
advertising spiels, marketing
communications, sales notices and
promotional material.

reactions to Jack's characterization

are your publishing activities

delivery environment? Let Editors

Make an Original Sound

    
Writing that causes readers to stop
in their tracks.

By Peter P. Jacobi

We've addressed the subject of
detail, the power thereof.

We've also discussed the issue of
show vs. tell: that to show means to
bring the reader close to place or
person or situation.

In each case, the writer is using the
right information, concrete
information, and attaching to it just
the right words in just the right
combinations.

It's writing that makes a reader stop
in his tracks.

It's writing that opens a world in
her mind.

 sound in the world, it makes a
thousand echoes." That's what detail
is, at least potentially: an original
sound. It's what showing does.

You are There

Robert Mads Anderson is, according to
the records, the first person to have
made a solo climb to the highest
mountain on every continent.
Recently, for USAir Magazine, he
adapted a chapter from his book,
Summits: Climbing the Seven Summits
Solo, this particular chapter dealing
with a harrowing effort to reach
Antarctica's highest peak.

"The ice was blue and crisp," he
writes, "my ice tools barely
penetrating the surface. The air
temperature, steady at 40 below zero
Celsius, froze my breath into
crystals that floated onto the ice.
The air froze into the back of my
throat and seemed to be dripping
icicles into my lungs."

I'm there, or at least I can begin to
understand what it's like.

It reminded me of a very different
place and situation, as described by
Jean Fritz, the children's book
writer, in her autobiography. "Who
would know by looking at a map what
the Yangtse River really was?" she
asks. And then she answers:

"Orange-brown, muddy mustard-colored.
And wide, wide, wide. With a river
smell that was old and came all the
way up from the bottom. Sometimes old
women knelt on the riverbank, begging
the River God to return a son or
grandson who may have drowned. They
would wail and beat the earth to make
the River God pay attention, but I
knew how busy the River God must be.
All those people on the Yangtse
River! Coolies hauling water. Women
washing clothes. Houseboats swarming
with old people and young, chickens
 they could see where they were going.
I loved the Yangtse River, but, of
course, I belonged on the other side
of the world. In America with my
grandmother.

"'Twenty-five fluffy little yellow
chicks hatched from our eggs today,'
my grandmother wrote.

"I wrote my grandmother that I had
watched a Chinese magician swallow
three yards of fire."

I'm there, or at least I can begin to
understand what it's like.

As in the case with Susan Orlean when
she writes for The New Yorker: "The
people who shop at Sunshine Market, a
grocery store in Jackson Heights,
Queens, are thin and beautiful. They
are also fat and plain, relaxed and
frantic, Colombian, Italian, Jewish,
Indian, African-American, Bolivian,
Uruguayan, Vietnamese, young, middle-
aged, elderly, rowdy, meek, cheerful,
world-weary, rich and broke. They buy
health food. They buy Ding Dongs and
Diet Coke. They have just come to
America. They have lived in America,
in Jackson Heights, in the same
apartment, with the same furniture in
the same arrangement, for sixty
years. They are in a big hurry. They
are in no rush and hoping to bump
into their neighbors for a chat. They
are in minks. They are in their
pajamas, wearing stacks of hair
curlers and no makeup. They are
buying the works for a dinner party.
They are buying a Lean Cuisine
Chicken Fettucini to eat alone." And
so forth.

Yes, I'm there, or at least I can
begin to understand what it's like.

These writers are doing their job.
They are linking a reader to their
own experiences.

 . . .MORE. . .


James Kilpatrick, that always lucid
commentator on writing, has said: "We
must look intently, and hear
intently, and taste intently. . .we
must look at everything very hard. Is
it the task at hand to describe a
snowfall? Very well. We begin by
observing that the snow is white. Is
it as white as bond paper? White as
whipped cream? Is the snow daisy
white, or egg-white, or whitewash
white? Let us look very hard. We will
see that snow comes in different
textures. The light snow that looks
like powdered sugar is not the heavy
snow that clings like wet cotton.
When we write matter-of-factly that
last night it snowed and this morning
the fields were white, we have not
looked intently."

Such intensity comes from a curious
and gripping direction in a passage
written by Brenda Miller, this for an
essay in The Georgia Review. "I have
never been touched by someone blind,"
she writes, "but I can imagine what
it would be like. She would read me
like Braille, her fingertips hovering
on the raised points of my flesh,
then peel back the sheets of my skin,
lay one finger on my quivering heart.
We could beat like that, two
hummingbirds, and become very still.
Her hands might move across my
abdomen, flick the scar below my
belly button. My eyelids would
flutter at her touch, and my skin
dissolve into hot streams of tears."

Richard Rhodes in How to Write speaks
of writing as "a craft that cuts
windows through the terrifying
opacity of the world." Brenda
Miller's words do that.

So does David Stout when, for The New
York Times, he expresses a complex
feeling this way: "So much has been
written about the joy of hunting and
so little about the sadness, the
sadness that fills the silence after
 hunting. "I was not squeamish, say,
about slitting the belly of a freshly
killed rabbit and dumping the
steaming guts onto the damp leaves on
a chill November day. But I cannot
forget the day when I was 13 and shot
at a big rusty fox squirrel three
times before it came tumbling down
from the trees, bounding off limbs as
it fell, then trying to crawl away.

"And this hunter who would not remain
a hunter grabbed the animal by its
tail, dragging it to a clearing to
finish it off with the gun butt. Then
he stood still in the dusk, listening
to a chain saw in the distance and
waiting for his sadness to go away.
He has been waiting for 40 years."

Intense. Penetrating. I am at one.
I'd be at one even if I felt
differently about such activity.

I return to the word "understanding."
Stout makes me understand.

As does Neil de Grasse Tyson in a
very different way. His recent
article, "When Galaxies Collide," for
Natural History, warns of such
universal events. They're happening
even as I write, even as you read.
Horrors. Fears. But then he tells me:
"During the cosmic acrobatics,
individual stars easily pass by each
other through interstellar space
because galaxies are mostly empty, in
spite of how packed they look. For
example, if there were just four
snails running loose in the
continental United States for a
billion years, then two of them would
be more likely to accidentally bump
into each other than would two stars
during a galactic collision."

I can breathe easier.

Give-my-all Writing

Much closer to home, George Dismukes,
an independent filmmaker, reflects on
"What it's like to live in prison,"
for Newsweek. "At day's end we were
returned to our night cells," he
says. "Night is when the morons and
neurotics holler and shake their
bars, when the fanatics cry out
entreaties to their God. One can
shout obscenities at the neighbors
with impunity. Those who would like
to sleep are not permitted to have
earplugs.

"The jail," he continues, "also
offers the pleasures of solitary
confinement. That's where I am right
now, in lockdown. One day they came
and brought me here, without
explanation. After the bedlam of
where I had been, the quiet was a
blessing, for I like to read and
exercise my mind by filling yellow
legal pads with introspection. That's
me; solitary is tougher on those with
little education or sense of
contemplation. On the wall of my cell
are graffiti left by former
residents. One welcomes the newcomer
to hell, others speak of the horrors
of aloneness. I realize how fortunate
I am that for me silence holds no
terror."

This is give-my-all writing.

It is what Annie Dillard calls for in
The Writing Life when she says: "One
of the few things I know about
writing is this: spend it all, shoot
it, play it, lose it, all, right
away, every time. . . .The impulse to
save something good for a better
place later is the signal to spend it
now. Something more will arise for
later, something better."

Tips for Writing to Government
Employees.

   
Understanding the needs and
idiosyncrasies of a "unique culture"
-- that of the U.S. government -- has
made one publication something of an
authority on covering computer news
for governmental employees.

Government Computer News, a biweekly
that has won eight Computer Press
Association awards and consistently
outdistances its competitors in
readership, targets the buyers and
users of computers in government.
Chief editor Tom Temin let's us in on
some of his publication's trade
secrets:

 --Focus on products, technology.
Although the government buys the
computers covered in GCN, the federal
procurement process is given minimal
coverage in the paper. Instead,
editors take a technical-product
oriented tack with their editorial.
"Research over the years shows
readers are less interested in the
arcane points of procurement than
they are in the computers," says
Temin.

 --Keep readers apprised of what
their colleagues are doing.
Government employees want to know how
their associates are doing in their
own agencies, says Temin.

 --Run product reviews. "We were the
first, and until this year, the only
government publication to have its
own product test facility and to run
every-issue product reviews," says
Temin.

 --Always take the government user's
point-of-view. "We're very parochial
about covering the government,"
remarks Temin. "Even when we do
product coverage -- the same product
everybody's covering -- we don't
cover it unless there's a government
angle to it."  --Patricia Donohue,
assistant editor.

Get Authors' Permission for Reprints
Whether Electronic or Print


Understanding reprint rights under
current copyright law.

By Ellen M. Kozak

A magazine establishes a Web site on
the Internet to familiarize more
people with the magazine, create a
favorable impression of it, and
hopefully increase readership. Each
month they put up a copy of the table
of contents for people to browse and,
in addition, the editors select the
best article in the issue and put it
on the Web site, as well. What's
wrong with this picture?

Another editor is about to publish an
article about the transportation
strikes in Paris. In the article, the
author mentions Jacques Chirac. The
editor adds an editor's note that the
magazine published an article on the
French president last year, and
invites readers to get a copy by
sending an s.a.s.e. Is that
permissible?

A Matter of Copyright/Contract

Both of the examples above boil down
to reprints -- one in print, and the
other electronic. Whether a magazine
has the right to issue either kind of
reprint is a matter of copyright and
contract; both kinds of reprint are
considered publication under the law.

Although electronic rights are
turning out to be a hot area for
copyright lawyers, the answers to
some of the questions that occur seem
fairly clear under current copyright
law. Others, however, are less so --
and may become more complicated as
customary author/publisher agreements
evolve to meet the needs of new
technology.

Writer's Status Determines Writes

What rights a publisher has in
relation to a contributor depend on
the status of the writer. Is the
piece written by a staffer as part of
his or her job? If so, it is legally
classified as a work made for hire,
and you, as publisher, own all the
rights and can publish or distribute
it as you choose.

But pieces written outside the scope
of employment -- for example, a
humorous column written by your copy
editor -- like pieces contributed by
freelancers, are works in which all
rights (including reprint and
electronic rights) originate and
remain with the author.

Exceptions to Rule

There are three exceptions to the
rule that the creator of the work
retains the full copyright. The first
exception is for works made for hire.
To fall into this category, an
article, sketch or photo (all three
are copyrightable) must (1) be
specially ordered and commissioned,
(2) fit into one of nine classes (one
of which is collective works such as
newspapers and magazines), and (3) be
subject to an agreement in writing
signed by both parties stating that
the work is and was always intended
to be made for hire.

The second exception requires an
assignment of rights. An author can
assign all or any portion of the
rights that make up the copyright in
a work but the law requires copyright
assignments to be in writing.

Special Provision in Law

Both of these exceptions obviously
require a contract. If you are not
using a contract with your
contributors, there is a third way
that you acquire at least some
rights. The drafters of the current
U.S. copyright law understood that
many newspapers and magazines do not
habitually use contracts, so they
built in a special section of the law
to address the rights of authors in
their contributions to collective
works. It reads as follows:

"Copyright in each separate
contribution to a collective work is
distinct from copyright in the
collective work as a whole, and vests
initially in the author of the
contribution. In the absence of an
express transfer of the copyright or
of any rights under it, the owner of
copyright in the collective work is
presumed to have acquired only the
privilege of reproducing and
distributing the contribution as part
of that particular collective work,
any revision of that collective work,
and any later collective work in the
same series."

Ambiguity in Section of Law

The first sentence of this section of
the law is pretty clear: copyright --
the right to reproduce a work,
distribute it, display it, perform
it, and create derivative works based
on it -- initially belongs to the
creator of the work.

However, the second sentence,
although it's construction seems to
imply a restrictive reading
("acquired only the privilege
of . . ."), does contain a certain
amount of ambiguity. Just what
constitutes a revision of a
collective work or a later collective
work in the same series? Could either
of these conceivably include an
electronic version?

Get Written Agreement

Until Congress or the courts clarify
this, your best way of making sure
you have acquired the rights you want
is a written agreement. Bear in mind
that supplying reprints, either in
hard copy or on-line -- or
authorizing others, such as UnCover
to do so, may well constitute an
infringement of the author's
copyright. If doing these things is
important to you, get the permission
in writing.

Bear in mind, however, that acquiring
these rights may mean you have to pay
the author a higher fee, or a
royalty, or an annual license fee.
Writers survive economically by
reselling articles to non-competing
markets. The availability of an
article out on the Web cuts down on
its value to other publications.

As for the answers to the questions
at the beginning of this piece -- if
the articles are not works made for
hire or if you haven't obtained all
rights to them, your best course of
action is to obtain the writer's
written permission to distribute or
electronically display the articles.
Putting it into your contract is your
best way to preserve good relations
with a contributor and avoid the
possibility of copyright
infringement.

K-III Holdings Agrees To Acquire Field Publications

K-III Holdings (NY) has signed a definitive agreement with Field
Corp. (Chicago) to acquire the assets of Field Publications and
Funk & Wagnalls for an undisclosed amount. Field Corp. had put
Field Publications on the block in July and recently confirmed that
it was involved in talks with K-III on sale of the company (EM,
Dec. 10, `90). Its investment banker for the transaction is Morgan
Stanley.

The sale, which is expected to be completed early this year, involves
Field's classroom periodicals, including Weekly Reader; book clubs;
supplementary materials for children; and its Funk & Wagnalls
encyclopedia and educational materials publishing unit, acquired in
mid-1988 (EM, June 6, `88). These businesses, which employ about 950
people, have estimated combined sales of more than $300 million. With
the acquisition, K-III, a publishing-oriented investment partnership,
will operate seven publishing and information businesses with 2000
employees and post yearly sales of about $500 million.

According to William F. Reilly, chairman and CEO of K-III, the
acquisition provides a strategic fit with K-III's educational unit,
Newbridge Communications, a direct marketing company specializing
in books clubs and continuity programs for teachers and children.
Newbridge markets to more than 400,000 teachers, and Field's Weekly
Reader and ancillary publications go to more than 8.5 million
elementary students and 700,000 teachers. Field's book clubs and
continuity programs serve the children's book market through the
mail, and F&W publishes a children's encyclopedia marketed through
mass-market supermarket distribution. In terms of product and
management, no major changes are anticipated. Field Publications is
based in Middletown, CT.

Commerce Department Puts Textbook Sales At $4.06 Billion

Shipments of textbooks totalled $4.06 billion in 1990, with sales
almost evenly split between el-hi and college sales, according to
estimates prepared by the U.S. Commerce Department for its annual
publication U.S. Industrial Outlook 1991. For the entire publishing
industry, The Outlook showed shipments totalling $14.5 billion in
1990, a 6.7% increase over 1989. When adjusted for inflation, the
Commerce Department data showed shipments up 2.5% in the year.
A slowing economy which featured minimal growth in personal
consumption expenditures was cited as a leading reason for the
modest sales growth in the year, which fell below Commerce
Department estimates of real growth of 3.6%. Restrained school and
library funding were also named as reasons for the lower than
expected growth.

The Commerce Department also estimated that publishers' profits
were hurt in 1990. While publishers achieved limited economies
through improvements in manufacturing and distribution operations,
these savings were reduced by higher editorial, marketing and
administrative costs, the report said.

Despite a soft economy, the Commerce Department's outlook for 1991
sees publishers benefitting from a more coherent funding pattern
for textbooks, nominal gains in disposable income and from
continued demand for books in the international marketplace. On the
negative side, postal rate increases and higher costs for paper
will put pressure on margins. Commerce sees rising school
enrollment and gains in education funding pushing U.S. book
industry sales to $17.3 billion this year, an increase--adjusted
for price increases--of about 3% from 1990.

For the longer term, Commerce forecasts real growth of about 3.5%.
Growth will be accompanied by moderate cost increases as paper
mills and book printers become more efficient in the manufacture
and printability of recycled and acid-free paper. El-hi enrollments
are projected to rise by 3 million students in the 1990-95 period,
while 10.2 million people are expected to move into the high
income, heavy reading segment, aged 35 to 54 during this span.

Education Publishing Stocks Drop 26.2% In 1990

Stock prices of education publishers fell by 26.2% last year,
compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which declined by
4.4%, according to a round-up of publicly held companies. All
publishers posted declines, and those of all but one, McGraw-Hill,
showed declines in the double-digit category. M-H's stock price
dropped by 7.3% to 52 5/8, compared with 56 3/4 at the end of 1989.

Hardest hit was Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, down by 80.2% to 15/16
from 4 3/4 a year ago. Wall Street is evidently not convinced that
the beleagured company will successfully complete a turnaround. It
was followed by John Wiley, which recorded a drop of 43.4% to 30,
compared with 53 at the end of 1989. Investor Theodore Cross'
recent low key stance regarding Wiley has dampened speculation that
Wiley may soon be put in play.

Waverly similarly recorded a hefty drop of 30% to 17 1/4 from 24
1/2 at the close of 1989, also a victim of diminished speculation.
Following in descending order are Times Mirror, down 25.2% from 35
3/4 to 26 3/4 at the end of 1990; Plenum, down 20.2% from 28 1/2 to
22 3/4; Houghton Mifflin, down 19.8% from 38 7/8 to 24 3/4; and
Paramount, down 19% from 50 1/2 to 40 7/8.

Houghton Mifflin Hopes For Better Growth in `91

Acknowledging that it has failed to achieve its minimum financial
goals of 10% compounded growth in sales and net income for the past
few years--including 1990--Houghton Mifflin said it is hopeful it
will reach that target in 1991. Results in 1990 were hurt by a 20%
increase in developmental costs as well as lower than expected
college revenues.

Speaking at PaineWebber's Outlook for the Media Conference, HM
chief financial officer Stephen Jaeger said both HM's trade &
reference division and school division are expected to show strong
growth in 1991. The school division in particular is expected to
benefit from a host of new developments undertaken in 1990,
including the development of an elementary social studies program
that will be introduced this year. El-hi social studies is a new
segment for HM.

Company margins should benefit from more modest increases in
developmental costs, Jaeger said. Improvements in technology have
been a two-edged sword when it comes to margins, he reported. While
technology has improved publishing efficiency, it has also placed
pressure on marketing and selling costs by causing schools to
expect lots of extras when selling texts.

HM chairman Nader Darehshori also touched on the ancillary
materials issue, observing that the biggest change in marketing he
has seen over the years is the amount of freebies schools have come
to expect. He claimed that HM has one of the smallest
implementation packages in the industry and said the company has no
plans to expand that kit. He added that some competitors could
become so desperate for short term gains that they might increase
the size of the incentive package.

Darehshori also said that HM will continue to increase its
attention on the high school market in order to meet rising
enrollments. During 1990, HM introduced a new English program for
grades 9-12 as well as new editions of its math program. A new
American history textbook is also set for this year.

Adoption opportunities for reading this year are expected to be
broader, and H-M has just started intoducing a new 1991 reading
program called Houghton Mifflin Reading: The Literature Experience,
Dareshori said. He noted that early responses from the market have
been positive, with the program already having been adopted in
Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Mexico and Oklahoma.

No Fire Sale At Maxwell Communication Corp.

Though its debt still stands at 1.7 billion pounds, Maxwell Communication
Corp.s' joint managing director Kevin Maxwell told analysts at
PaineWebber's Outlook for the Media Conference that MCC is not in
a fire sale position and will not sell any more operations unless
it can get a full and fair price.

MCC executives sought to put distance between their company and
advertising-dependent companies that have been battered by a slump
in advertising by noting that only 10% of its business relies on
advertising revenue. MCC's businesses also do not rely on the
economic fortune of one nation, executives said. Although about 80%
of MCC's business is headquartered in the U.S., more than 30% of
revenue from those businesses are derived from offshore.
MCC was more forthcoming than McGraw-Hill about its hopes for
taking take its Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. public,
saying it hopes to take the venture public by the third quarter of
1991 subject to market conditions. In an earlier presentation, M-H
chairman Joseph Dionne was vague about prospects for taking the
school publisher public. According to the agreement, however,
either party can offer all or some of their own shares in an
offering. MCC seems more eager to take the publisher public than
M-H.

Minority offerings in other MCC companies such as OAG and Pergamon
Press will not be considered until after the offering for M-M-H,
Maxwell said. Those sales will also depend on market conditions.
Maxwell also indicated that all sales would not be solely to raise
money. The recent sale of 20% of Berlitz to a Japanese private
education company to form Berlitz Japan (EM, Nov. 19 `90) helps the
company to tap Japanese students to buy our products, Maxwell said.
Berlitz provides language instruction and translation services.

New M-M-H Activity Series

The Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. has released two
new series of activity books aimed at boosting parental involvement
in elementary mathematics and science education. The two series are
called Helping Your Child At Home . . . With Mathematics and
Helping Your Child At Home . . . With Science, and consist of
activity books for each grade level in K-8 in mathematics and K-6
in science. The books present no-cost activities that can be done
at home to reinforce concepts learned at school and they are
correlated with M-M-H's basal elementary and science textbooks.

William Talkington, vice president of the M-M-H's School Division,
told EM that the two series are being sold directly to schools at
a price of $4.95 per volume-in-the-series. The company is also
offering a single-copy purchase price of $7.95. No plans are being
entertained to sell the series to the retail market, he told EM,
noting that the company is more intent on working with schools and
parents.

Books Strongest Performer For Times Mirror

The short term outlook for Times Mirror is not encouraging,
chairman Robert Erburu told attendees at the recent Outlook for the
Media Conference, adding, however, that he was still optimistic
about long term prospects. Book publishing and cable operations
have been the company's strongest performers in the year, he said.
As part of efforts to cut costs in the year, TM plans in 1991 to
reduce capital spending to less than $300 million and has set
stringent limits on acquisitions.

In the company's professional publishing group, Erburu said that
Matthew Bender and Jeppensen Sanderson finish 1990 with
double-digit gains in both revenues and operating profits. Bender's
18-volume Bender's Federal Tax Service has had strong growth in the
year. Richard D. Irwin was also expected to have finished the year
with double-digit revenue increases led by its basic accounting
texts. Mosby-Year Book and CRC Press are also having record years
with improved margins.

The professional publishing group expects to post total revenues in
1990 of about $750 million, an increase of about 15%, he said. The
outlook for this year is positive, with new introductions
supplementing selective price increases.

Professional publishing revenues for the first three quarters of
1990 were $541.6 million, up from $460.3 million in the like 1989
period. Consumer publishing posted revenues of $227.1 million, up
slightly from $224 million in the earlier period.

Although commercial printing has overtaken book printing as the
largest segment for Banta Corp., the company remains committed to
both the general and education book markets, executives said at
PaineWebber's Outlook for the Media Conference. Both chairman
Calvin Aurand and senior vice president Gerry Henseler reported
that books remain a significant contributor to Banta, and have
solid margins. In addition, Aurand told the analysts that Banta
would consider making an acquisition primarily in two
areas--hardcover books and soft cover manuals.

Banta's commitment notwithstanding, Aurand said growth in the
production of paperback books for education should be slower in
1991 than in `90. Aurand was hopeful, however, that business in the
general book area would remain strong and he was particularly
optimistic about the prospect for soft cover manuals. The growth of
the computer industry continues to feed the growth of the computer
manuals business, Aurand noted.

Aurand and Henseler were optimistic that Banta will hit its
targeted goals of a 9% growth in revenues and a 13% increase in
profits in 1990. Aurand said Banta was cautiously optimistic about
1991, noting that he is confident revenues will be there, but added
that margins are a concern.

The executives also said that the negotiations for the sale of
Banta Ventures, Banta's video production unit, are continuing with
the management of that operation. Banta said in October it was
planning to divest itself of the video segment to focus on its core
businesses of printing and graphics, a sentiment Aurand reiterated.
And while Aurand acknowledged this is not the easiest time for
management to get money, he said he was still confident a deal with
Banta Ventures management will be completed.

Scholastic's U.K. Unit To Acquire Deutsch Children's Books

Scholastic Inc.'s U.K. subsidiary, Scholastic Publications Ltd.,
has entered an agreement to acquire Andre Deutsch Children's Books,
the children's hardcover publishing unit of Andre Deutsch Ltd. The
acquisition is expected to be completed early in the new year.

The Deutsch unit, with estimated sales of about 1.3 million pounds,
publishes about 50 titles a year, including trade hardcovers and
paperbacks, and has a backlist of more than 500 titles. Acquiring
it will afford Scholastic a rapid expansion of its publishing
program. It would have taken us five years to build up Scholastic's
hardcover list, and this acquisition allows us to get there
immediately, said David Kewley, managing director. The acquisition
will significantly enable us to expand our hardcover and paperback
publishing from the substantial base of the Deutsch hardcover list
and our own Hippo paperback list.

Deutsch staff will join Scholastic on completion of the
acquisition, and its sales force and Gollancz, its distributor,
will continue to sell and distribute the children's list until
mid-year. At that time, Scholastic will move to new offices in
central London that will house all children's book publishing
staff, and its Hippo sales force will take over the Deutsch list.

celebrating 100 years of publishing with a special centennial issue
this month that provides a retrospective of 100 years of teaching
and chronicles landmark events in education during that period. The

Communications in 1987 and acquired by Scholastic in mid-1989 (EM,
July 3, `89).

Separately, Scholastic has named David F. Rodriguez to the new post
of national sales director for the education marketing group. He
was formerly education marketing representative, a position being
filled by Nancy A. Farrell, previously account manager with The Ivy
League Network. Rodriguez will be responsible for developing sales
strategy, overseeing sales staff and new business development for
sponsored educational programs. Farrell will oversee development of
sponsored educational programs in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast
regions.

It's Curtain Time For AT&T Interchange


The fat lady finally sang.  AT&T is phasing out its proprietary online
publishing platform AT&T Interchange by the end of 1996, Michael Kolowich,
president of AT&T New Media Services, told EIR (see related story).

Why shut down the online version?  "With this move, we are acknowledging and
capturing industry and customer trends," Kolowich said.  "We are creating open
and inoperable standards," with the Web initiative.

Publishing Partners Jumping Ship

AT&T InterChange never really took hold as a leading electronic publishing
system.  The service literally only had a handful of publishing partners -
five to be exact - ZD Net, Gartner Group, The Star Tribune Online, The
Washington Post/Digital Ink and The Journal Register.

During the last few months, several publishing partners have been turning to
the World Wide Web to publish their information rather than use AT&T
InterChange.  For example, The Star Tribune Online (STO) announced that it
would upgrade its World Wide Web presence.  A STO/Web edition is scheduled for
release in February.  STO is a unit of Cowles Media Company.  SIMBA
Information Inc., publisher of this newsletter, is an affiliate of Cowles.

Gartner Group announced its Web publishing strategy this week (see related
story).

ZD Net, an electronic warehouse of computer product and industry news,
announced its Web site earlier this year.  Digital Ink and Journal Register
Company have yet to state their Web publishing initiatives.

Europe Online, which licensed AT&T Interchange last year, abandoned the online
platform earlier this year in favor of the Web (EIR, Nov.  17, 1995).

Interchangeable Parts

Kolowich said that "there is a tremendous amount of reusable[AT&T Interchange]
components that are applicable to Web use, such as software code and tools."

Where it's appropriate, "some AT&T Interchange publishing partners will
continue to provide their content on BizNet," Kolowich said.  Pieces of AT&T
Interchange's publishing partners content are already available on BizNet.

AT&T New Media Services expects to redeploy its AT&T Interchange development
staff.  AT&T New Media Services has 300 employees.  "None of those 300
employees are part of AT&T's severance package," Kolowich said.  AT&T is
cutting 40,000 jobs over the next three years (see related story).

AT&T Abandons All Online Systems For Web

AT&T is following in the footsteps of many other online services and content
providers and abandoning its other proprietary online systems o ImagiNation
Network, an online games service and PersonaLink, an e-mail service o and will
remodel these services based on World Wide Web standards.

AT&T said that a small portion of a $4 billion after-tax restructuring charge
against fourth quarter earnings would cover its online products being written
off or revalued.

Web Version Of AT&T BizNet By Mid-96


A World Web Web version of AT&T Business Network (BizNet), a newly launched
online service, will debut by mid-1996, said Michael Kolowich, AT&T New Media
Services president.  The company will phase out the online version of the
service.  BizNet, which launched this fall, is an online information service
for business professionals (EIR, Sept.  22, 1995).

BizNet, which has in excess of 10,000 registered users, is "growing rapidly,"
Kolowich said.  Since launch, the company has distributed more than 100,000
trial kits.

"We expect usage to be mushrooming on the Web," Kolowich said.  "What's more
challenging is the content [piece]...there's currently more content than
eyeballs habituated to it [the Web]."

The most usage on BizNet is currently being generated from the Dow Jones and
CNN content components (EIR, Oct.  20, 1995), Kolowich said.  Entrepreneur
toolkits, research tools and daily discussions are also popular, he added.

$10M+ Ad Campaign

As part of BizNet's launch, AT&T is spending in excess of $10 million on its
6-month marketing and advertising campaign that kicked off with various ads in
early December and during this past season's collegiate football bowl games,
Kolowich said.

Gartner Group Follows Other AT&T Interchange IPs To Web


Like other AT&T Interchange content providers including The Star Tribune
Online, Gartner Group plans to offer @vantage, its online market research and
analysis service on information technology on the Internet starting in the
second quarter (EIR, May 12, 1995).

The @vantage Web site, which will be developed independently of AT&T, was
motivated by Gartner's desire to broaden availability of @vantage, said Kate
Berg, company spokesperson.  Berg denied that the mirror site on the Internet
foreshadows a break from its eight-month-long relationship with AT&T
Interchange.

"We have a lot of customers that would be very upset if we moved off
Interchange," said Berg, noting that since launching in May 1995, @vantage is
profitable and has grown steadily to 1,000 users, most of which are Gartner
Group clients.

Gartner charges clients $2,000 and non-clients $4,800 annually to subscribe.
Assuming 60%-85% of the 1,000 @vantage subscribers are clients, @vantage
generated estimated subscription revenues of $2.4 million to $3.1 million by
the end of 1995.

@vantage also takes a small share of transaction revenues from its ten
partners which include BRP Publications, Dataquest, Esther Dyson's Release
1.0, Individual and Pathfinder Research, Jeffrey Tarter's SoftLetter, Amy Wohl
and Workgroup Strategic.

Momentum Picks Up In Business Information Market


The demand for data in new electronic formats and information on new
technologies has pulled the business information market out of its recession,
according to the newly published Business Information Markets 1999:  The
Strategic Outlook (BIM).  SIMBA is the publisher of BIM and this newsletter.

Business information growth rates have risen steadily over the last few years,
from 2.9% in 1991 to 5.1% in 1992 and 5.6% in 1993.  Business information
revenues reached $25.4 billion in 1994, a 9.5% increase from $23.1 billion in
1993.  Revenues are projected to exceed $27 billion in 1995.

BIM defines business information as any copyrighted or proprietary information
produced for a business or professional audience.  The research report
concentrates on 10 business publishing markets and media, including online
databases, print databases, trade magazines and newspapers, face-to-face and
audiovisual services, general business periodicals, research services and
reports, looseleafs, newsletters, CD ROM databases and business books.

Largest Segment By Format - Still Print

As it has in past years, print remains the largest business information
segment by format, with sales of $13.7 billion in 1994.  However, print's
market share continued to slip from 57.0% in 1993 to 54.3% in 1994.

Electronic services accounted for 37% of the business information market in
1994, according to BIM.  Sales of electronic services were $9.3 billion in
1994.  By 1999, SIMBA estimates that online services will account for close to
50% of business information revenues.

The remainder of the market consists of face-to-face and audiovisual
information services, which had revenues of more than $2.2 billion.
Face-to-face and AV accounted for 8.8% of the market in 1994, down from 9.1%
in 1993.

Database Revenues $13.8B In '94

Database publishing continues to be the largest business information segment,
with revenues of $13.8 billion in 1994.  Comparatively, database publishing
revenues were $12.1 billion in 1993.  BIM defines databases as any collection
of information from archival literature and text documents to real-time
financial services and market quotes to directories and fax updates.

Challenges Ahead

There are several obstacles ahead for business publishers, including the
uncertainty of advertising revenues, demand for wider distribution of data,
industry consolidation and increased market competition.

Reuters '95 Sales To Fall Shy Of Record '94 Levels


Reuters' 1995 sales growth will reach into the double digits, but will not
equal last year's record-breaking 23% growth, according to Reuters chief
executive officer Peter Job.  "Expect gentle reduction in this growth
rate...due to record sales back in mid-1994, when the market was very hot,"
Job told analysts at the Paine Webber Outlook For Media conference last month.

Reuters' sales are currently in a deceleration mode.  Job hinted that
full-year results will likely be less than the 17% growth posted for the first
nine months of 1995.  An annual growth rate of 15%-17% would bring Reuters'
1995 sales to between $4.14 billion and $4.21 billion.

Job described Reuters' 1996 revenue outlook as good, but said the company is
not assured of double-digit gains because of continuing consolidation in the
U.S.  financial market.  Reuters already has in place initiatives to reduce
1996 operating costs, in case the growth slowdown continues.

"Broadly, we feel we will have a reasonable set of financials for next year,"
he summarized.

Despite that forecast, Reuters continues to dominate the financial information
business.  Reuters' share of the $5.5 billion to $6.0 billion market has risen
from one-third to two-thirds, Job maintained.  Reuters generates 90% of its
revenue from information products, where it competes with Dow Jones Telerate,
Bloomberg and Knight-Ridder Financial.  Transaction products represent the
company's second-highest revenue generator.  Media products represent just six
percent of revenues.

International Expansion Targeted

In the next three to five years, Reuters will direct its growth efforts to
emerging financial markets such as Russia, China and especially Japan.
Reuters presently distributes financial information to 154 countries.  Only
one-third of these countries are mature markets, while the other two-thirds
represent growing or emerging markets with vast potential, Job explained.

To illustrate the growth opportunities in emerging markets, Job noted that the
average site in such markets has only two to three user accesses, while
developed countries average 10 accesses per site.  In Russia, for example,
Reuters seldom sees a competitor, and already enjoys "reasonable market share"
in China, Job noted.

New Business Information/Transaction Products

Reuters will also look to develop new business information/transaction
products for niche professional markets, like insurance and advertising and
marketing, where demand will come from managers who don't have access to their
competitors' financial statistics.

Specifically, Job pinpointed the insurance industry as a niche Reuters hopes
to target.  he also reaffirmed the company's commitment to providing
information for the advertising and media industry.  Reuters already owns a
20% stake in AdValue Media Technologies (EIR, Dec.  10, 1993).  "Contribution
[from niche professional markets] to sales growth, in my opinion, will quite
rapidly become material," Job said.

McGraw-Hill Companies More Innovative In '96, Dionne Says


Expect to see more innovation from The McGraw-Hill Companies in 1996, Joe
Dionne, MHC chairman and chief executive officer, told analysts at the Paine
Webber Outlook For Media conference last month.

"In the midst of all the talk of the software revolution and the information
superhighway, we believe that companies with content have a bright future
indeed," Dionne said.  The company believes that its breadth of content gives
it a distinct competitive advantage in the development of new electronic
services for businesses and consumers.

One year ago, MHC had not yet stated its Internet strategy (EIR, Jan.  6,
1995).  MHC has been cautious and slow to move to the World Wide Web.

New Electronic Products

So what's ahead for MHC in 1996?  The company is prepared to provide its
customers "with the information they want, in the form and frequency they
desire," Dionne said.

MHC will also enter the consumer market for the first time in 1996 with its
newly formed Home Interactive Division.  The company provided sparse details,
but expects to release its first group of electronic products for the 1996
holiday selling season, said Terry McGraw, MHC president and chief operating
officer.  In the corporate market, MHC is planning to create electronic
extensions of its existing product lines, especially World Wide Web services,
McGraw said.

1996 Will Be Challenging

While 1995 was a good year, Dionne said that 1996 "will be a more challenging
year," especially in the school sales area.  Despite these challenges, the
company expects "another year of double-digit increases," he said.

Financial services, which was an important part of MHC's growth in 1995, is
the company's fastest growing global business, said McGraw.  In particular,
MHC's Financial Services should see growth in the Far East.  Although
transaction volumes have been declining, sales increases are predicted in 1996
for Standard & Poor's Debt Ratings.

The company continues to develop new financial services products, including a
broader portfolio of risk evaluation products.  MHC launched its Bank Loans
Ratings products in June 1995 and is already generating new revenues from this
product, McGraw said.  "The rebound continues at MHC's DRI unit," which
performs econometric forecasting, according to McGraw.  He expects another
year of "progress and profitability."

Shepard's Faces A Tough Year

Within Educational and Professional Publishing, the company's largest revenue
generator, is Shepard's legal publishing unit.  Shepard's had a solid year in
1995 due to the release of its federal citator revision system, McGraw said.
However, Shepard's "faces a tough year in 1996," due to the planned sale of
the company's topical business, which will lop off $22 million in sales.
There won't be a new release of the popular citator revision system, he added.

Information and Media Services, which contains all of MHC's advertising-based
businesses, reversed four straight years of declining margins, McGraw said.
The company aims to improve margins again in 1996.  Business Week, the
company's largest ad revenue producer, also had an outstanding year.

Construction Information Better In '96

In 1995, there were "some signs of life" in the construction information
business, as the company continued to reshape this business (EIR, Jan.  6,
1995), McGraw said.  In the first 10 months of 1995, the construction industry
was up 1.0% from one year ago, he added.

EUROPEAN TV PRODUCTION TO GET FINANCIAL BOOST
More channels mean more content opportunities

     Increased channel capacity will lead to increased revenue
opportunities for European television production companies in 1996.
     "There are so many channels that you can't go on showing American
reruns forever," said Nicholas Littlewood, managing director of
London-based Communications Equity Associates International Ltd. 
"There is a thirst for new product, and we will see a number of new
television production finance companies coming into existence,
certainly in the U.K." 
     This does not necessarily mean the market will expand for
Hollywood-produced content.  Most European governments have been
trying to move away from Hollywood influences, opting to fund home-
grown projects instead:

     * Recently, the European Commission proposed a $265 million fund
for European film and television producers;
     * Proceeds from a U.K. lottery were used to encourage a domestic
film industry; and
     * The French government mandates that at least half of its
country's cable programming come from French producers.  French
producers make about 150 films each year.

     Indeed, the French government has been particularly hard on
American content.  For instance, it fought to keep Ted Turner's
Cartoon Network off the country's television screens before finally
relenting.
     This could open up a huge market for European film producers. 
While more channels are being created (and more distribution paths
such as cable and satellite), some European governments have vowed not
to fill the additional channels with programming from the United
States.
     "I don't see any radical changes," Littlewood said.  "So while
there is going to be more content in terms of channels, there are
still heavy restrictions on what is shown on specific French
channels."
     Other countries, however, appeared to have embraced American
programming.  Germany-based The Kersh Group admitted recently that it
was going to increase its American content dramatically.  Analysts
deemed this revelation a blow to the German television industry.

Consumer Wants

     While some European governments are looking to legislate
Hollywood out of their countries, consumers are sounding a different
note.
     "In terms of popularity, people by and large prefer American made
films," Littlewood said.  "They have a more universal appeal in Europe
than films coming from any one particular country within Europe."
     In France, for instance, U.S. films hold four of the top five
spots.  In Italy, U.S. films account for 75 percent of the market.
     Indeed, few European films have achieved international
popularity.  Recently, there have been some exceptions (the U.K.'s
"Four Weddings and a Funeral" and France's "Nikita" and "Cyrano" have
translated well to the United States) but the general rule of thumb is
that Hollywood films will play well in Europe.
     Some European producers see the trend changing.  With proper
funding, European films could compete with Hollywood.  And that
funding, as well as the unspoken Hollywood quotas, could lead to a
more competitive environment.

Convergence

     1996 could be the year of the takeover/merger in the United
Kingdom.  Many analysts predict consolidation in the cable industry
will continue.  Currently, the U.K. cable market is saturated, meaning
new alignments will be formed and companies will begin to sell off
their divisions.
     "The convergence between telephony and cable and interactive
services is undoubtedly happening," Littlewood said.
     The path is being smoothed somewhat by the British government,
which is considering legislation relaxing cross-ownership limits,
allowing more freedom for newspapers and broadcasters to be owned by
the same person.
     John Hall, managing director of U.S.-based John Hall & Co. Inc.
predicted cable finally will begin to make some inroads on the
satellite-dominated market.
     "European cable should do well this year in a market
traditionally dominated by the satellite companies," Hall said.

New Media

     The new 'new media' market will offer content providers a new
programming outlet, and everyone is looking for new areas of growth.
     Newspapers, such as The Financial Times, are expected to play
around with online services far more this year.  
     "There are a lot of exciting developments in interactive games,"
Littlewood said.  "Awareness of the Internet is surging."
     Hall agreed, predicting the Internet will hit a global market
this year.
     "There will be tremendous market opportunities for any company
that knows how to use the Internet," Hall said.   
     Interactive television, however, will not be much of a factor in
1996, analysts predicted.  The much-hyped technology still will be in
a testing phase for much of the year.
     "It hasn't taken off yet," Littlewood said.  "We are all waiting
to see what the results of that are."

COMPANIES TO WATCH IN 1996:

     * Pearson plc has transformed itself from a conglomerate into a
much more specific media company.  It has The Financial Times.  It is
looking very actively at new media.  It has reorganized a lot of its
old-fashioned publishing interests.
     * Reed Elsevier will be interesting.  It is moving into higher
margin businesses, discarding a lot of divisions, such as regional
newspapers and electronic book publishing.
     * Havas will be interesting.  The French economy is obviously
having a tough time at the moment, but I think they are in the process
of reorganization.

SEX SELLS: EUROPEAN MARKET READIES FOR ADULT-ORIENTED ONSLAUGHT
But don't look for X-rated material to stick around for long

     European consumers can expect an influx of adult-oriented
programming in the coming year if the development of the Internet
continues to follow current market trends.
     Indeed, many analysts are looking at X-rated movies and games as
the Infobahn's dirty little secret, saying they financially will drive
the digital highway's development to the tune of close to $1 billion.
     The international market for adult-oriented programming quickly
is filling up with companies looking for profits:

     * Playboy Entertainment increased its television presence from 17
countries three years ago to 130 territories today;
     * Graff Pay-Per-View Inc. adult programming is seen in Europe,
nine former Communist countries, parts of Africa, the Middle East,
Australia, Hong Kong and South America; and 
     * Graff's Home Video Channel boasted 200,000 U.K. subscribers at
the end of the second quarter.  Spice has about 20 million U.S.
households;
     * Penthouse formed a joint venture with Graff last fall to put
its content on European television, computer services and CD-ROMs.

     Analysts warn profits to be gained from adult-oriented material
are not necessarily limited to X-rated videos--even if they are one of
the most profitable pay-per-view applications has been adult movies.
     Adult-oriented games and gambling also are expected to make an
impact on the Infobahn's bottom line.  For instance, when the popular
Mortal Kombat II was released last year, it brought in $50 million in
the first week alone.

A Short Market

     Few industry observers, however, believe adult material will have
the drawing power to continue financing the digital highway.
     The same trends happened when the VCR was first released.  Adult
videos made up about 80 percent of the profits in the first year, but
they take in 10 percent now.
     "I don't think [X-rated movies] will be a major money maker in
the interactive business," said Jeff Bernstein, vice president of
programming for Request TV.
     While subscribers and revenues are up at many of the companies
peddling adult programs, so is the competition.  
     New adult satellite TV channels are launching in the United
Kingdom, across Europe and into the Far East.  Graff executives blame
Canada's more explicit adult services for the 8 percent drop in the
company's DTH satellite revenues.
     Adult programming has proved to be a risky venture for many
companies--such as U.K.-based Red Hot Television, which crashed and
burned in bankruptcy.  Even the genre's patriarch Playboy has had its
financial troubles over the years.
     "The true test will be in three years to see who's around and
thriving," Graff's Steve Saril told our sister publication
International Cable.

Graff's Financials

     The industry of sex is starting to be profitable for Graff, which
saw its second quarter 1995 consolidated revenues rise 6 percent to
$11.5 million.  The U.S.-based programmer owns the European-based Home
Video Channel, Erotica and The Adult Channel.  It also owns Spice,
Spice2 and Adam & Eve in the United States.
     For the first six months of 1995, revenues were up 15 percent to
$23.1 million.  Revenues for 1994 were $40.4 million, up 97 percent
over 1993.
     Graff executives point to Europe as their biggest growth area. 
The company entered the international market four years ago.  In that
time, it has had to learn to adapt to different foreign markets and
foreign regulatory regimes.
     To adapt, Graff tailors its programming to particular markets--
meaning it will show dressed (heavily edited) or undressed (unedited)
versions, said Christopher Yates, head of global expansion for Graff
programming.
     "We can tailor-make our service to a particular market," Yates
said.  "We have the largest library and we produce the most
programming.  We have all versions of all kinds of product.  We can
have four or five versions of a network if we need to."
     Playboy also offers different versions of its programming to
satisfy different markets, said Mary Herne, senior vice president,
international division for Playboy Entertainment Group.
     "Our programming works on both free TV and pay TV," Herne said.
     She noted a syndication deal was signed with Middle East TV
distributor Orbit to carry the non-nude version of Playboy's soap
opera "Eden."  It may be tame fare, comparatively, but it moves the
Playboy name and brand into the Middle East.
     In contrast, she said, there's Germany, "which has consistently
taken everything we've offered."
     Playboy produces about 22 feature-length movies and 26 half-hour
programs a year.

SIDEBAR

     The only countries that have been able to keep sex off TV have
been ones with either stringent conservative governments or a lack of
powerful satellite footprints.
     "There really isn't any sex on TV in China," said Randy Barbato,
director and producer of World of Wonder.
     In Africa, where Graff and Playboy are pushing to launch
channels, the sexiest show the directors found was a bathing suit
contest on broadcast TV.
     Middle East consumers circumvent their conservative government
with satellite dishes.
     A European trend in broadcast fare has been to put sex into game
shows.  Broadcast TV stations in Spain, Italy and Germany have prime
time shows that can be described as "Wheel of Fortune" with stripping.

BSKYB BEING INVESTIGATED

     The Office of Fair Trading in the UK is launching a wide-ranging
investigation into the programming supply arrangements of BSkyB
(British Sky Broadcasting), which could impact severely on the
satellite company's exclusive sports deals. The investigation will go
further than many in the industry expected and follows widespread
concern voice by a number of franchisees.  The Director General of
Fair Trading said the review "will be confined to the issues relating
to the supply in the United Kingdom of programming and related
services at wholesale level." The OFT is particularly concerned about
the length of BSkyB's sports contracts.  Exclusive sports contracts
have been a long-time feature of British terrestrial broadcasting, but
the OFT said that the market had changed over the last few years with
the growth of pay television.  The key deal in question is the five-
year agreement for soccer's Premier League, which includes a clause
enabling BSkyB to match rival broadcasters' bids for future rights.
The investigation will run in parallel with OFT's main six-month
review of the company's position in the pay-TV market.

NEW BIDDERS FOR PREMIER LEAGUE

     In the strongest indication yet that Nethold and DirecTV are to
challenge Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB in Europe, Channel 5's major
shareholders MAI and Pearson are understood to be planning a joint bid
with Nethold and Hughes Corp. (owner of digitally compressed DirecTV
package, which operates in the United States) for rights to the UK's
Premier League, which is coming toward the end of its joint contract
with BSkyB and the BBC.  Rumours that Nethold and DirecTV are to join
forces in Europe have recently been rife, with Nethold drawing in
experience staff from around Europe to its new television facility to
be based in the Netherlands.  BSkyB has already proved the vital role
football plays in driving up subscriptions and the purchase of
exclusive rights could prove to be the driving force in growing a
rival satellite package to challenge Murdoch.

KIRCH AND MMBG COME TOGETHER OVER MEDIABOX

     In a recent meeting at Deutsche Telekom office in Bonn, German
media magnate Leo Kirch finally agreed to cooperate fully with the
development of Mediabox, backed by MMBG's (Multimedia
Betreibergesellschaft), as a common standard for digital TV in Germany
and France, and ditching the development of its own unit D-Box.  The
decision has effectively managed to avert a standards war which could
have stalled the arrival of digital TV in Germany and seen Kirch-owned
pay movies channel Premiere's million or so subscribers equipped with
a totally incompatible system.  A spokesperson for the Kirch Group
commented, "It's in the best interests of customers if only one
decoder is needed."   MMBG will be restructuring its shareholding
following the arrival of Kirch, with the agreement possibly offering
some form of compensation to Kirch for costs incurred in developing
the D-Box.  MMBG's Mediabox looks set to become the standard in both
France and Germany and already has the backing of private cable
operator Veba, Deutsche Telekom, German state broadcasters ARD and
ZDF, French pay-TV broadcast Canal Plus, RTL, CLT and Bertelsmann.  So
far, a significant number of manufacturers have been signed up by the
MMBG, including Sony, Pioneer, Thomson, Philips and Sagem.  As we went
to press, the official accord was announced, with Veba said to be hold
to take a 25.1 percent state in MMBG.

OVUM ISSUES FINAL UPDATE ON ITV

     Ovum, the London-based market research company, has just issued
the fourth and final update to its report, "Interactive Television:
the Market Opportunity." The update contains a set of forecasts for
the interactive TV market to the year 2005. For the first time, the
forecasts include projections for key
countries in Asia-Pacifica--Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea,
New Zealand, and Singapore are covered.  John Matthews, principal
consultant with Ovum, said, "Interactive TV has been slow to take off,
but it offers significant opportunities in the medium and the long
term. According to Matthews the United States will be the first area
to become "cash positive" in interactive TV.  In 2002, Europe is
forecast to make a profit on capital monies
invested in the technology.  Ovum predicts that the Asia-Pacific
region will not become cash positive, even at 2005, the far range of
the report's coverage.
     Predictably, the United States will have about 26.4 million
households with cable access to interactive TV by the year 2005.  The
report also predicts that, by that year, revenues received by service
providers from advertising will be $780 million in the Asia-Pacific
region, $4.3 billion in Europe and $9 billion in the United States.

U.S. SOFTWARE COMPANIES LOOK TO GET LOCAL IN EUROPE
Developers invest in localizing their products

     U.S. software publishers are stepping up efforts to invade the
European market with foreign-language versions of their English-
language titles.
     The strategy in developing the international market sounds
simple: Developers need to read the markets they want to enter
properly.
     "Everything is a risk," said Hasbro Interactive Worldwide's Tom
Dusenberry.  "You have to hope you're betting on the right hardware
formats to go after.  You have to hope you're picking the right
product to make interactive.  That's something I lose sleep over."
     Developers looking to make money off of foreign-language versions
of their English-language titles need to determine which titles to
develop from the beginning of a production cycle.
     Developers also must account for how much memory various
characters or letters take up in different languages.  For example,
German takes up 50 percent more space than English.  Japanese also
requires a considerable amount of memory.
     Using this strategy, two companies, Interplay Productions Inc.
and Creative Wonders are hoping to increase revenues based on sales of
titles in Europe by 50 percent over the next year.

Peanuts In Europe

     Virgin Sound and Vision (VSV) also is channeling its enormous
financial resources into sought-after licensing deals and an
international launch strategy.
     "We're looking at products with  global appeal and global recoup
value, which allows us to put another hundred or hundred and fifty
thousand into the title," said Tom Turpin, VSV president and CEO.
     Virgin has inked deals with Softgold Gmbh in Germany and Hedarzi
in Israel to localize VSV title's for the developers' respective
markets.  The goal:  to create the same title in different languages
that reflects their respective idioms and nuances.
     "There's such a strong motivation (culturally) to get ahead in
those areas," Turpin said.
     Funded by entrepreneur Richard Branson, the content-focused
software company's first big title--Get Ready For School, Charlie
Brown--hit stores last fall and provides a window into the company's
philosophy.
     Sparing no expense, Virgin licensed characters from United
Features Syndicate and worked with Bill Melendez Studios, the firm
that created the animation for the Charlie Brown television specials,
to develop the title.

Big Bird in Europe

     Creative Wonders executives also are looking to popular
children's characters for profits, but they seem to have taken it a
step further.  Creative Wonders President Greg Bestick believes audio
elements have become a more important part of multimedia software, so
developers should secure authentic voices to reach discriminating
consumers.  
     The company dubbed in voices of local actresses and actors for
the characters in its line of Sesame Street titles.
     "We also focus on finding local voice content--new voices for the
different countries," Bestick said.
     One word of caution:  Keep the voice track separate from other
programming in a title.  "It's easier to localize if it's done that
way," Bestick said.

Interplay's Plans

     Localized products are more likely to sell if a publisher's
foreign release coincides with a domestic launch.  
     "Between 40 and 50 percent more products [sell] if the local
version comes out simultaneously with the U.S. release," Interplay's
Julie Roether said.
     If publishers release a U.S. version first, they risk losing out
on the sale of the foreign language version of a product.  
     If a German version of a product comes out much later than the
English version, it likely will have difficulty in the marketplace. 
Germans, who are very English literate, often will buy the first
version of a product even if it is in English.
     The biggest hurdle developers face in creating localized versions
of titles is making the commitment to do it.
     "The initial returns aren't there," said Bestick. "It's a leap of
faith."

PHILIPS PREPARES TO DEBUT DVD PLAYER IN ASIA
Company demonstrates prototype at MIP Asia

     As Philips Media prepares to distribute its high-density DVD
player in Asia, the media industry is standing up and taking notice.
     No other consumer electronics manufacturer has stated that it
will simultaneously deliver DVD as a peripheral for the PC and as an
accompaniment to the television.
     The company demonstrated for the first time its DVD player
prototype at  MIP Asia TV last week. Close to the new unified format
specifications, the two-hour video was in PAL on two widescreen TV
sets and was encoded in MPEG 2 in Eindhoven. It was stored on one
layer of a high density CD.
     While the quality of the picture can be improved, only members of
the Motion Pictures Experts Group could spot the flaws in the disc,
which showed the movie Four Weddings and a Funeral. Even so, the press
covering the event seemed impressed with the crispness of the picture
with the freeze-frame function.
     Market researchers predict 10 percent of consumers will but DVD
players by the year 2000.  
     Philips realizes the importance of backward compatibility of its
high- density player line in safeguarding the $120 trillion that
consumers worldwide have spent on CD-ROMs, said Peter Van der Poll,
general manager of Phillips Media Asia.
     Van der Poll stressed the interchangeability between applications
and played up the importance of the SD Alliance's acceptance of
Philips' modulation scheme last September.  When asked, Van der Poll
confirmed that with the purchase of an MPEG card, all Philips Video CD
products will work on a PC.
     Philips' officials declined to estimate the cost of the DVD
player, due to be launched in late 1997 or early 1998. 
     According to Van der Poll, Philips expects that the market for CD
drives will double in the next few years. The majority of the new
business will take the form of PC-based multimedia products.
     Philips set up its Asian operations in Hong Kong because the city
is the home of electronic publishing, film and music in the region. 
As in Europe, the company is promising local language products in
Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Cantonese, Malaysian, possibly Indonesian
and Tagalog.
     The company's hopes for the region are not limited to off-line
products.  Following the creation of United Philips Communications--
the joint venture with United International Holdings Ltd. that has
resulted in Europe's largest private cable multiple system operator--
Philips is weeks away from reaching agreements with three cable
operators in the region.
     The aim is to create more networks and develop three more cable
ventures over the next two years, said Van der Poll. 

Localizing Content

     As Philips tries to build up a CD catalogue, it will go to great
lengths to foster local content. "You need local content," Van der
Poll said.  "Up to 60 percent of our music business is based on local
content, local repertoire--we believe the same will be true for film,
for entertainment and definitely for education."
     The added benefit is that piracy will be reduced -- a problem
that in the past has been well documented in Asia, but which Van der
Poll said is slowly getting better. 
     Looking to the future, Van der Poll said that co-productions with
Beijing TV also are in the offing.  High-density CD-ROM will hit the
market by the end of 1996 or the beginning of 1997.
     He would not venture to anticipate the price, but offered, "if
you want to be successful in a PC application, the price has to be,
after a year or so, the same as the standards we are with now.  It
will be of the same order of magnitude as the current CD." Rewriteable
CD is in the cards for 1998.

CZECH REPUBLIC

     The political and economic situation in Czech Republic has
stabilized.  No basic changes are expected in the political scene,
even after the Parliamentary elections in 1996.  Macro-economic signs
are very favorable, and it is widely presumed that Czech Republic has
gone through the difficult phase of transformation.
     The main reasons for foreign investment are the Czech Republic's
fast economic development and its stable political situation.  The
Czech consumer and the advertising market have almost reached the same
level as Western Europe.
     Nova TV, which began broadcasting Feb. 4, 1994, was the first
private national television channel in Central Europe.  The station
quickly had the biggest market share and the highest number of viewers
per day.
     State television reacted to the increasing ratings of Nova TV by
changing the programming, adapting the prices and becoming much more
flexible.
     There is only one private regional television station, Premiera,
which covers more than 50 percent of the Czech Republic.  It
concentrates on the economically strong areas--Prague and Central
Bohemia.

INTERACTIVE SERVICES CAUSE MILE-HIGH HEADACHES
1995 was the year of the bug; will 1996 be the year it hits big?

     A new, seemingly overlooked market is looming for film and
television producers looking to peddle their content: the airline
industry.
     Indeed, interactivity was the hottest buzzword in in-flight
entertainment in 1995, but the systems airlines hoped would give them
an edge over the competition were plagued with continued bugs and
delayed tests.
     Enthusiasm continues among major airlines, despite challenges.

     * Northwest was forced to shut down its test of an interactive
Hughes-Avicom international system last summer.  Even still, the
carrier began tests of a redesigned version of the Hughes system in
September.  
     * United Airlines abandoned interactive features on its GEC
Marconi-supplied IFE systems after problems surfaced on systems
installed onboard its new Boeing 777 aircraft.  
     * Tests of interactive IFE systems scheduled with British Airways
and American Airlines also were postponed because of technology
challenges.
     * Plus, In-Flight Phone Corp. (IFPC) struggled with reliability
issues and scrambled to convince Continental, USAir and America West
not to cancel contracts.  IFPC began testing a new, debugged version
of its Flightlink IFE and communications system with Continental in
September.  

The Promise and the Glitches

     Even with the current problems, these advanced IFE systems hold
considerable promise.  
     * IFPC's Flightlink system, for example, is slated to begin live
multi-channel television and audio broadcasts via satellite by the
third quarter of 1997 and plans to have the capability to send faxes
to the ground from airline seats in the near future.
     * BE Aerospace, which has an IFE system boasts video-on-demand
capability, says it is hopeful its system (scheduled to be tested with
BA) will be ready for trials by March.  
     * Sony Trans Com teamed with Microsoft to develop a video-on-
demand product it hopes to be ready for customers by 1997.  
     * Matsushita Avionics Systems Corp., the vendor for the American
Airlines IFE program, hopes to have video-on-demand capability
available for that carrier's trial in the near future.
     * Cathay Pacific announced in August it would install two IFE
systems on its fleet, with plans to upgrade to interactive capability
by next year.         
     * In October, Alitalia went outside the pool of traditional
vendors to tap Interactive Flight Technologies Inc. (IFT) for a three-
month, 30-seat trial of its interactive video-on-demand system in its
recently revamped first class.  The system offers 22 video channels
with audio tracks in five languages. Videos played on the system are
completely under individual control and can be started, stopped, or
rewound by the passenger.
     If the trial meets with success, the carrier hopes to roll out
the system on seven more planes by mid-1996.
     "I still think there is a lot of smoke and mirrors out there,"
Dean Haehnel, president of the World Airline Entertainment Association
(WAEA), said about interactive IFE before the group's conference in
Amsterdam.  "There are a lot of companies demonstrating products that
have never flown, and there is still a lot of work to be done in the
area of interactive and video-on-demand. That is really the problem,
right now, the whole issue of reliability."

The Gambling Cure

     Another of the more promising---and unconventional---in-flight
innovations for carriers, vendors and passengers alike is in-flight
gambling.
     Finally, it seems, technology may have caught up with desire, as
Alitalia's IFE system premiered the capability for in-flight gambling,
though initially passengers will not play for money. 
     Also on the in-flight gambling front, Sky Games International
announced recently it had inked an agreement to provide its gambling
software for use with a major airline's in-flight entertainment
system. The software will be installed and ready for play as early as
next year.
     Sources say the contract was signed with Singapore Airlines, but
neither Sky Games nor the airline to date has confirmed this.
     Although in-flight gambling has raised a number of concerns,
industry studies suggest a single widebody jet equipped with
interactive IFE systems could generate up to $2 million a year -- half
of which would come from gambling.

ARE BROADCASTERS FALLING BEHIND IN THE RACE TO HDTV?

     As HDTV nears a critical juncture--the beginning of the FCC
terrestrial transmission tests--there is concern that
broadcasters are falling behind the satellite and cable TV
industries in the race for HDTV.
     Satellites already have carried HDTV, and cable just
announced plans for demonstration transmissions of the
technology.  Meanwhile, broadcasters have been forced to wait out
the FCC testing process.
     HDTV REPORT editor Charlotte Wolter polled leading experts
on whether the broadcast industry can keep pace as HDTV picks up
steam.  They said the cost of HDTV will be a significant problem
for broadcasters, more than for cable or satellites, which can
get the technology on the air more quickly and inexpensively.
     The good news is that broadcasters also are developing
models for the introduction of HDTV that will keep costs within
reach of most local stations and keep the industry in the HDTV
race.
     "Right now broadcasters face a tremendous cost imbalance
relative to cable companies," said Lynn Claudy, National
Association of Broadcasters (NAB) director, advanced engineering
and technology.  "A broadcaster is inherently a local beast and
ultimately, any HDTV service would incorporate some local element
of production."
     "Cable has an advantage in that they don't need a
transmitter for every headend," said Julius Barnathan, senior
vice president for advanced technology and strategic planning,
Capital Cities/ABC, "But...they would need new boxes that are
smart....Nobody gets off cheap."
     While cable wins a short-term public relations coup from the
HDTV initiative, the real impact, said James McKinney, chairman
of the Advanced Television Systems Committee, is to "reinforce
the absolute certainty that [broadcasters] must have a good
system."  In the past, he said, broadcasters assumed a standard
could be "good enough--not as good as MUSE or what we see
elsewhere--but good enough.  But this means they have to pick
something that is a golden standard, and if they don't, others
will be ahead of them."
     The cable demonstrations also have raised the specter that
broadcasters will be left behind.  "That's a significant portion
of the motivation to move ahead," said Howard Miller, senior vice
president of broadcast operations and engineering for PBS.  But
with its role in the FCC process, "Is cable going to march off
ahead," Miller asked.  "Not unless broadcasting chooses not to do
it."

Broadcasters Must Find Whether There Is a Business in HDTV

     Given its inherent cost disadvantage, broadcasters have to
decide how to compete in HDTV.  "Is terrestrial going to be [like
AM radio after FM appeared] and find a different local business,
or will it be able to continue to play competitively in this new
arena," asked Joseph Flaherty, vice president and general
manager, engineering development, for CBS.  "Certainly cable,
[direct broadcast satellite], home video and fiber can play in
the game."
     "The question remains, how do broadcasters secure profit out
of it," said McKinney.  "When color came on, broadcasters charged
extra if someone wanted a commercial in color."  Miller agreed,
"From the station standpoint, it's a very basic question: Is
there any revenue potential with this technology?  They have to
think very carefully about whether they will make the
investment."
     Nevertheless, there is optimism that conversion is possible.
During this week's NAB National Show, Flaherty will present a
detailed study that will state that stations have a wide range of
choices for conversion.  It will suggest a 4-step process,
starting with signal pass-through for as little as $1 million
--with digital HDTV.  Next, stations can add local 16:9
broadcasts with a wide- screen version of today's TV, then a
lower-quality version of the FCC standard, then finally full
HDTV.  Studio equipment, the most costly item, can be phased in
over 5-7 years on regular replacement schedules.
     Economies also can be found in studio conversion, said
Merrill Weiss, managing director, advanced television systems,
for NBC.  Serial digital systems now finding their way into
studios could be adapted for HDTV, he said, if the right choices
are made in data rates and formats.
     Each station, Flaherty emphasized, will find a schedule
appropriate for its market.  "Large markets have funds to do it
first and tend to be in tougher competitive environments.
Smaller stations do it later, and even in major markets they
don't do everything at once."
     Flaherty believes an industry that made the transition from
black and white to color can handle HDTV.  "People worried about
cost, and it took time for smaller stations, but it would be hard
to find a black-and-white station today.
It's not simple, not cheap; it's very difficult and takes good
business judgment, but we've done it before," he added.

HDTV DISPLAYS:  MISSING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE FOR
CONSUMER MARKET

     As the HDTV broadcast picture begins to clear,it has become
more and more apparent that a criticalelement is missing:
low-cost, large-screen displays of 40 inches diagonally or
larger.  The lack of suitable displays is a serious bottleneck in
the development of a consumer market for HDTV.
     Many are convinced the HDTV experience is apparent only on
screens 40 inches across and larger.  Large displays are
"absolutely" necessary, said Julius Barnathan of ABC.  "Let the
[40-inch CRT] stick out into an apartment," he joked, adding,
"This is a problem, a fundamental problem."
     "Until we have large screens, the American public is not
going to be swayed," said the NAB's Lynn Claudy.  "It has
to...really slap them in the face. That's possible with large
screens--4, 5, 6 feet."
     But CRTs are difficult to make that size and would be too
bulky for the average home.  "Sony made a 46-inch [CRT], but it
weighs hundreds of pounds. That size will be the end for tubes,"
said D. Joseph Donahue, senior vice president, technology and
business development for Thomson Consumer Electronics. "Today no
one knows how to make large flat panels [that size]--never mind
the economics, just to demonstrate."  The industry "might see
demos this decade," he said, but not flat-screen products.
     Some HDTV displays based on current technology will sell.
"The 27-inch [variety] is the most popular, at 4:3 [aspect
ratio]," said James McKinney of the Advanced Television Systems
Committee.  "What's important is screen height.  If you take the
same height and convert it to high-definition [9:16 aspect
ratio], you come out to 37-38 inches diagonally [a size CRTs can
manage]."
     "High-definition makes as much sense in a 17-as in a 40-inch
set," said Greg DePriest, vice president, advanced TV technology
and strategic planning for Toshiba America.  "I don't think HDTV
means the end of 17-or 22-inch sets."

**SPECIAL REPORT--AN INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD WILEY**

     HDTV REPORT editors David Bross and Britton Manasco sat down
recently with the Chairman of the FCC Advisory Committee on
Advanced Television Service, Richard Wiley, for a wide-ranging
interview on the state of the global HDTV industry and the FCC's
efforts in moving toward selecting a U.S. HDTV standard.  The
interview was conducted at Wiley's Washington, D.C., law firm
Wiley, Rein & Fielding.  Wiley was the chairman of the FCC from
1974-77 and also served as an FCC commissioner and general
counsel.  Here's what he had to say:

HDTV REPORT:  Why has the United States opted for a mandated
HDTV standard rather than having one evolve naturally in the
marketplace?

Wiley:  I can only speculate, to some extent, because it is,
obviously, an FCC determination.  They set up the advisory
committee.  I think the reason is we're dealing here with a very
important decision for the country.  When you look at when the
last television standard was set--in the 1940s--you realize
whatever decision you make is going to be an important one.  I
think it's one in which the government feels it wants the private
sector input, but it ultimately needs to make the decision
itself.  I think this commission, unlike decisions that past
commissions might have made, wants to make that decision.  I
think it's a very interesting process and hopefully will be an
effective one.
              One thing it clearly has done is to stimulate
private sector activity in this area.  Before the fall of 1987,
I'm not aware of very much that was going on in HDTV in this
country.  We've got some very impressive U.S. proponents, as well
as foreign proponents, and we have well over 500
people drawn from various private sector companies, many of them
U.S.-based, who are active in the work of the advisory committee.
And I think that out of this may come a very good decision.

HDTV REPORT:  If American-based companies knew that their
foreign-based competitors were active in HDTV prior to 1987, why
the lack of movement domestically?  Were there barriers to HDTV
development?

Wiley:  No, I don't think so.  Of course, we have not been as
big a factor in the television manufacturing business as we might
have, but I think that this effort has, perhaps, renewed some of
our resolve in this area.  It brought out some of our
technological prowess, which is good.  But I can't tell you why
we weren't involved in it before.  To some extent, we may have
leapfrogged some of the activity that has gone on abroad--if
digital-based technologies prove they will actually work.

HDTV REPORT:  Are developments in compression driving the
recent push toward digitally based HDTV systems?

Wiley:  Yes, I think there have been, as I understand it, some
compression breakthroughs that companies have developed.  I think
the stimulus of General Instrument coming forth with a digital
system is good.  I think it drove some of the other proponents to
examine what they are doing and to see whether or not they could
use that same technology to bring their product to the
marketplace.             A year and a half ago we had a meeting
in Chairman Sikes' office with a number of engineers in this
field and they felt that terrestrial broadcasting, digitally, was
not possible--perhaps not even in this century.
HDTV REPORT:  Is it taken as a given by the FCC that the
continued profitability of the local broadcaster is in the public
interest?

Wiley:  No, I don't think that's the basis on which the
commission decided to pursue terrestrial broadcasting.  The
commission has not said that it is trying to protect broadcasting
profitability or even the industry itself.  I think the
commission's theory is that terrestrial transmission may be the
quickest and the least expensive way to bring advanced television
service to the American people.
     At the same time, we're not trying to hold back other
technologies.  I'd encourage cable to work very closely with
broadcasting so that we can have an advanced television system
that will work for both broadcasting and cable.  And I've been
very pleased that the 2 industries have been working together in
harmony on this through the Advanced Television Test Center and
CableLabs.
     I think that's one of the great advantages of our system
here.  Also we've encouraged, and had a working party look at,
alternative media.  If there is a direct broadcast satellite
system in this country, it can go right ahead and provide
advanced television service.
     But the point is, we don't have that currently in this
country.  But we all have television sets.  We do have a very
ubiquitous broadcast and cable system in this country and I think
the commission has rightly determined that this is the best way
to proceed for now.  Clearly, Japan and Western Europe are
looking at a DBS service for HDTV and that should be technically
possible here as well.
     Nothing the advisory committee is doing should impede [DBS].
I think that's an advancement in the state of the art.  If it
happens, so be it.  There's one thing I would like to add,
however.  We are a little different than Japan.  We have 4 time
zones in this country--a very geographically large country.  The
FCC also has a commitment to localism in broadcasting and I think
that fits naturally with [its call for] a terrestrial means of
transmission.  But I don't see it as a protectionist view for
broadcasting, so I support what they've done.

HDTV REPORT:  Recently, Chairman Sikes has expressed concern
over the speed at which the test committee is moving--what is the
status of testing?

Wiley:  Well, I agree with him, of course, that we want to keep
pushing the process.  Yes, we've had delays, but I think the
theory has been that we're going to keep setting deadlines and
then back off the deadlines if there are developments that
necessitate it.  There are a number of reasons why we've
experienced delays.  Number one, the proponents have changed
their designs and their formats.  Four of them have gone to
digital modes.  They would not have been ready to be tested under
the old schedule.  And I think it's in the public interest to
have had that delay and I think Al Sikes agrees.
     Number 2, there have been delays in the delivery of
equipment to the advanced television test center.  The format
converter, manufactured by Techtronics, has been delayed.  I'm
not saying that in criticism of that company, because it is a
very complex product, but I think it is characteristic of the
problems that we are running into.
     We're sailing on a sea that has never been charted before.
The equipment that we are utilizing to test these systems has
never been made before.  The proponents themselves have never
been there.  So, I think some delay has probably been inevitable
and probably beneficial.  The bad news is there has been a delay.
The good news is there has been a delay.
* Editor's Note: Look for more coverage of our interview with
Richard Wiley in the next news-filled issue of HDTV REPORT.

EVERYONE'S DOING IT:  HDTV SOFTWARE DEMAND HEATING
UP; INVESTORS EYE PROFITS

     This will be the year the tremendous investments that HDTV
production pioneers made inexpensive and untried equipment will
begin to pay off.  There finally will be enough demand for HDTV
production to provide a return to the production houses that have
geared up for HDTV, industry sources told us.
     "It's really picking up this year," said Club Theater
Network President Ron Ratner, whose company has an HDTV
production studio, including an HDTV telecine.  "I think we did
more in January and February in high-definition than all last
year, billable, not giving away stuff anymore."
     Some organizations that are potential buyers of HDTV
      programming are:

     * NHK: The Japanese national broadcaster plans to up its DBS
      broadcasts to
      6, and some say 8, hours per day by the end of the year.
       Movies converted
      to HDTV will take up a significant chunk of that time, but
      the broadcaster
      also has ordered travelogues, music programming and sports;
     * PBS: Public broadcasting is committed to demonstrating
      advanced television for the public, said Senior Vice
      President Howard Miller, but it currently is struggling to
      assemble equipment donations.  However, PBS plans
      original HDTV productions, probably in music, for 1991;
     * Cable: It is not clear if CableLabs' HDTV demonstration
      will include original programming, but it is linked to
      Scientific-Atlanta's HDTV production/transmission venture
      with Captain New York, which will produce and transmit
      special-event programming via satellite;
     *Europe: The advent of B-MAC broadcasts will require wide
     aspect-ratio programming, some of which will be original
     programming; and
     * Non-broadcast markets: There is growing demand in special
     effects for films and projection HDTV for amusement parks
     and public displays.

     While producers are beginning a wider variety of projects,
most of the pioneering HDTV producers are seeing an increase in
projects, not just for NHK but for other buyers as well,
including:

     * Zbig Vision Ltd.: NHK just commissioned a documentary
     called "Manhattan"
      and another called "Washington," for a total of one hour of
     HDTV.  Zbig
      also will produce a one-hour special on Franz Kafka for a
     French company,
      Telemax.  The show will be shot on a sound stage with
     actors inserted into
      a set of miniatures and models reproducing Prague of
      Kafka's time;
     * Captain New York: President David Niles said his company
     has done fashion shows for NHK, as well as music,
      travelogues, ballet,opera--universally acceptable
      programming.  An adventuresome project has been to film
      comedian Jackie Mason in HDTV.  He added, "There is serious
     talk of networks of movie theaters joining up this summer"
      for what he describes as "close-up concerts," where artists
      are filmed close up in the studio to give the audience the
      feeling of being at a small concert;
     * NHK: Rupert Stow, who coordinated the NAB's HDTV
     programming sessions,
      said NHK is "straining to fill 3 hours or more each day
     with electronically produced high-definition programming,"
     with nature programming popular.  "They tend to go overseas
     for entertainment, and some of the programs they are
     financing in this country are art- or entertainment-based;"
     and
     * Club Theater Network: Ratner predicted studios will use
     his telecine for "action movies or production-value movies,
     lots of blow-ups and lots of chase scenes."  The company
     also is doing special effects using a Symbolics machine and
     opticals with an HDTV Ultimatte.  In discussion are a
     long-haul demonstration with fiber optics network firm Vyvx
     and a project with cable.

*High-definition television (HDTV) has hit the Japanese market

*High-definition television (HDTV) has hit the Japanese market
years ahead of plans by other nations.  Most large Japanese
electronics makers have introduced new consumer HDTV products,
including televisions, videocassette recorders and adapters that
allow HDTV broadcasts to be seen on present TV sets.  But with
the new sets priced at 10 times or more than that of current
top-of-the-line models, consumers may not be rushing to the
stores.  The new equipment, displayed at an international
broadcast equipment show near Tokyo, demonstrates how far ahead
Japanese companies are in commercializing the technology.  Prices
for the new equipment on display at the show ranged from a
Mercedes Benz to a Ford.  Sony's new 36-inch HDTV set, one of the
less-expensive models announced, lists for about $17,700.  A
company spokesman insisted the sets will be bought by "ordinary"
Japanese, to whom Sony plans to sell an initial 100 sets per
month.  "Our current 32-inch model is priced at about $30,700.
In 5 years, we hope to bring that down to about $7,700," said
Hideji Matsuda of Toshiba's new media division.

ATTC SWEEPSTAKES:  WINNERS AND LOSERS,OR WILL THERE
BE PRIZES FOR EVERYONE?

     When the FCC makes the final decision on anHDTV terrestrial
transmission standard, sometime early in 1993, the commission
probably will be picking winners and losers, industry analysts
told HDTV REPORT.  One company or group of companies is likely to
celebrate while others mourn the lost millions they invested.
     The FCC is likely "to pick one of the systems that we know
about now and not likely to force some combination, like the
Zenith RF system and GI's encoding system," predicted James
McKinney, of the Advanced Television Systems Committee.  "Out of
the tests will come one victor."
     There are 2 major parts to the technologies--bandwidth
compression and the transmission system.  Asking contenders to
combine features of their systems could be both a technological
and copyright nightmare, and could produce the proverbial
camel--a horse designed by committee.
     The perception that the government probably will go for one
system has proponents jockeying to combine or redefine proposals.
"There have already been a few accommodations," said CBS' Joseph
Flaherty.  "Whether they combine or not will be a commercial
decision.  I don't think the government will force
[combinations]."  He added, "The digital systems are similar, but
there are enough differences that one could have an advantage
over the others."
     "There will be some losers," said Merrill Weiss of NBC, "but
a single winner is very difficult to predict."

Zenith-General Instrument Still Viewed as Potential Combination

     One combination generating frequent speculation is General
Instrument and Zenith.  "I think it would be a wonderful
combination," said McKinney, "but GI is more interested than
Zenith."  He added, "GI needed help, but they have gotten that
now in their combination with MIT.  That gave them a dramatic leg
up in the RF area.  Their weakness was in the transmission
system, the RF system, and that has now [probably] been covered
by MIT."
     Still, a Zenith-GI coupling is attractive.  "It would make
an obvious all-American winner," McKinney said.  Another factor
is that Zenith is a manufacturer of receiving equipment, while GI
and MIT are not.  Although the winner will have to license the
technology, "if an equipment manufacturer wins, they get to build
for free, so that's probably why GI is interested," he said.
     There is still time right up to testing date for proponents
to get together on their own, "but once they enter the [Advanced
Television Test Center] lab and put the equipment on the test bed
and run tests, then it's very difficult," warned McKinney.  "This
is big risk time.  I don't think everybody is going to win," he
said.  "They're all big boys and they know what they're doing."

LONDON ONLINE SHOW ATTRACTS RECORD CROWD

     by Tom Hogan

     [Editor's Note: "Information Today" Publisher Tom Hogan was in London
last month at Learned Information Europe Ltd.'s Online Information 95 meeting,
so we asked him at deadline to prepare this quick report. Next month, in his
first "European Report" column for "IT," U.K.-based information industry
writer-editor Richard Poynder will cover the conference in depth.]

     The Online Information 95 exhibition, held in London December 5-7,
attracted a total of 16,870 visitors, clearly establishing this event as the
largest electronic information meeting in the world. The meeting, formerly
known as the International Online Information Meeting or IOLIM, celebrated its
19th anniversary this year with an attendance growth of some 35 percent.

     "The widespread media coverage of the Internet has brought our industry
into the limelight," said Jill Cousins, director of marketing for Learned
Information Europe Ltd., sponsor of the meeting. "In fact, however, we have
been promoting the use of electronic information for the last 20 years. The
substantial increase in the number of visitors at this year's meeting reflects
the growing recognition of the importance of electronic information services
for general business and scientific use."

     The exhibition, held at the Olympia 2 conference and exhibition center,
housed 346 exhibitors and featured a special Internet floor under the banner
of "Internet World International Winter 95." Learned Information Europe Ltd.
will hold its main Internet conference, Internet World International 96, on
May 21-23, also in London.

     On the conference side, slightly over 1,000 attendees listened to
presentations as varied as "Online Pricing: Changing Strategies in a Changing
World" to "Assessing the Impact of the Internet and Online Services on
Traditional Publish-ers" to "Peace and Information in the Middle East."

     The complete 612-page proceedings of the conference can be purchased in
North America from Information Today, Inc., 800/300-9868.

COMPUTER SECURITY SURVEY: FINANCIAL LOSSES AND INTERNET BREAK-INS

     In addition to the problems of hackers, ex-employees, and unscrupulous
competitors, increased use of the Internet for business purposes is a growing
concern for information security professionals, according to the Third Annual
Ernst & Young/InformationWeek Information Security Survey.

     More than half of those surveyed reported security-related financial
losses in the past year--with 20 companies reporting losses in excess of $1
million. And of those using the Internet for exchanging information
externally, 20 percent reported successful or attempted break-ins in the past
year.

     Forty percent of the Internet business users expressed dissatisfaction
with Internet security, the survey found. At the same time, a commanding 87
percent of Internet users stated that they would use it more for business
purposes if security were enhanced. More than two-thirds of those not using
the Internet now, but planning to within a year, said they would increase
their potential use even more if its security were improved.

     Most companies surveyed admit that they do not have adequate tools or
properly trained personnel to defend against information security losses,
which can run into millions of dollars. But Daniel E. White, an Ernst & Young
partner specializing in information security, points out, "Companies are
demonstrating growing awareness of security problems and increased willingness
to devote additional resources to their solution."

     "Information security should be decentralized," said White. "As companies
rely on advanced information technology to exchange data among remote
locations such as plants, branch offices, and warehouses, effective security
systems need to be implemented in those locations, and the people in charge
locally must regard information security as part of their responsibility. To
assist in this effort, common guidelines for security must be developed
centrally and uniformly enforced at all locations."

     The report, which surveyed 1,300 chief information officers (CIOs) and
other senior information executives, looked at a wide array of other security
issues, ranging from problems of "telecommuting" employees with remote access
to a company's systems to the importance of being placed on security in new
client/server environments.

     Other key survey findings are:

     --   More than two-thirds of respondents surveyed reported encountering
          a virus in the past year.

     --   A lack of proven security tools/solutions is a major obstacle to
          good information security.

     --   A notable increase was reported in the number of security heads who
          report to the CIO (43 percent in 1995, 32 percent in 1994, and 27
          percent in 1993).

     "Our survey results over the past three years show that information
security issues are becoming better understood. And the increased awareness
that management is putting on computer security is very encouraging--budgets
are increasing, more tools are being implemented, and security professionals
are becoming more involved in the systems development process," White said.

     The survey also reports that nearly half the companies surveyed have
ongoing information security awareness programs, although fewer companies have
such programs as part of the orientation process for new employees. More than
three-fourths have a formal corporate information/data security policy.

     For more information or a copy of the survey, contact Bernard Wedge of
Ernst & Young LLP, 216/861-8884; e-mail: bernard.wedge@ey.com.

CADMUS DEBUTS JOURNALS.AT-HOME, TEAMS WITH UNCOVER CO. FOR DOCUMENT DELIVERY

     Cadmus Digital Solutions (CDS) has established JOURNALS.At-HOME
(http://journals.at-home.com) on the Internet's World Wide Web with the
electronic debut of 18 prestigious scientific and medical journals.
JOURNALS.At-HOME debuted last October with table of contents and abstracts for
the October issues of "Stroke," "Circulation" (twice monthly), "Circulation
Research," "Hypertension," and "Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular
Biology," published by the American Heart Association; "The American Journal
of Pathology" published by the American Society for Investigative Pathology;
and the "Journal of Immunology." In addition, complete articles in "The
Cutting Edge," a section of the "Journal of Immunology" and table of contents
for 11 journals published by the American Society of Microbiology went online.
Subsequent issues go online simultaneously with the mailing of printed
catalogs.

     Journals, electronic catalogs, and databases residing on JOURNALS.At-HOME
are linked externally to other sites and will soon be linked internally as
well, to meet the growing interactive and communications needs of scientists,
physicians, engineers, researchers, scholars, librarians, and teachers,
according to Cadmus. JOURNALS.At-HOME offers an evolutionary approach whereby
publishers can initially go online with table of contents and then add content
gradually. The content opportunities can include complete articles, letters to
the editor, images, editorial board profiles, subscription ordering, product
literature, online catalogs, and more.

     "With JOURNALS.At-HOME, we have created a single collaborative space
where the objectives of publishers, end users, and advertisers can all be
met," said Frederick Bowes, president, Cadmus Digital Solutions, and creator
of JOURNALS.At-HOME. "Helping content owners generate new revenues from their
online services is an important component of Cadmus Digital Solutions'
publisher-oriented approach."

CADMUS/UNCOVER PARTNERSHIP

     Cadmus also recently announced a strategic partnership with The UnCover
Company to provide online document delivery service within JOURNALS.At-HOME.
The UnCover Company provides a comprehensive, multidisciplinary database
containing over seven million article citations, indexing nearly 17,000
journals worldwide. JOURNALS.At-HOME will begin offering document delivery
service early this year.

     Without leaving the JOURNALS.At-HOME service and depending on each
publisher's configuration, researchers, educators, and professionals will have
the opportunity to quickly access complete articles from a journal's table of
contents, or abstracts residing in JOURNALS.At-HOME, and complete articles
cited and back issues of journals residing in the service. Users will generate
online orders directly with The UnCover Company and receive printed articles
within 24 hours via fax.

     "Through our collaboration with The UnCover Company, an industry leader
in the field of document delivery, CDS now has the ability to meet the
objectives of both end users and publishers," said Bowes.

     "Those seeking cutting-edge research can quickly and conveniently access
quality resource materials, saving valuable time. Publishers benefit by making
it easy for users to obtain legal copies."

     The UnCover Company and its parent company, The CARL Corporation, a
leading provider of library automation services, are owned by Knight-Ridder
Information, Inc.

     Cadmus Digital Solutions is part of Cadmus Journal Services, a producer
of scientific, technical, medical, and scholarly journals. Cadmus Digital
Solutions offers Internet publishing and content management services along
with new media products to professional and scholarly publishers, including
the more than 400 highly specialized journals already produced by Cadmus.

SEVEN DATABASES TO ADOPT OVID INTERFACE

     Ovid Technologies has announced that three Cambridge Scientific Abstracts
databases--Cambridge Life Sciences Collection, Cambridge Aquatic Sciences &
Fisheries Abstracts, and Cambridge Environmental Science & Pollution
Management are being implemented with Ovid software, to appear on CD-ROM,
networks, and online. Additionally, Ovid plans to create electronic
implementations of four academic databases--Bowker's Books in Print, the MLA
International Bibliography, PAIS International, and Sociofile. Each will be
equipped with Ovid software.

CAMBRIDGE DATABASES

     Cambridge Life Sciences Collection covers the international literature of
over 21 separate life science disciplines, including cell and molecular
biology, neuroscience, biochemistry, biotechnology, entomology, ecology,
immunology, microbiology, genetics, agriculture, and veterinary science. The
database is derived from 22 journals which abstract and index 6,500 worldwide
publications.

     Cambridge Aquatic Sciences & Fisheries Abstracts is the leading database
in aquatics science, produced in collaboration with four UN agencies and a
network of national research centers. Coverage includes developments in the
science, technology, and management of marine, freshwater, and brackishwater
environments and organisms.

     Cambridge Environmental Science & Pollution Management covers relevant
fields across the environmental sciences, monitoring 1,500 primary journals,
monographs, and conference proceedings and providing selective coverage of
5,500 secondary sources. The database is drawn from the primary sources for 11
abstracts journals. It covers the ecosystem and all forms of pollution,
including air, marine, and freshwater pollution; environmental engineering,
toxic hazards of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other substances; biochemical
applications in water treatment and pollution; and more.

     Ovid's implementations of all three databases will include special Ovid
features. Among these are Pull-Down Search Menus, combining field-specific
text descriptions with easy searching of all fields; Database-Specific Limits,
allowing users to restrict more precisely the result of a search to predefined
criteria, such as language, document type, and publication year; and Advanced
Output Configuration, permitting searchers to define the fields to be viewed,
printed, or saved.

ACADEMIC DATABASES

     Produced by the Modern Language Association of America, The MLA
International Bibliography indexes critical scholarship on literature,
language, linguistics, and folklore. The bibliography provides expansive
coverage of national literatures in more than 100 languages, as well as
linguistic research and analysis of every language family and group; it
contains entries for journal articles, series, monographs, dissertations,
bibliographies, proceedings, and other materials. In all, the bibliography
indexes more than 3,500 publications.

     The MLA International Bibliography on Ovid will incorporate the print
bibliographies since 1963 and will include more than 1.2 million records. Ovid
will offer the MLA thesaurus as a convenient pull-down tool, allowing
first-time users to employ the same concise vocabulary as experienced
searchers. A pull-down permuted index and a classification hierarchy will
further enhance advanced search techniques. Familiar Ovid features such as
on-screen search tips, database-specific limits, and configurable output will
make the bibliography exceptionally easy to use. The MLA International
Bibliography on Ovid will soon be available for networks and for fixed-fee and
pay-as-you-go online access. The database will be updated 10 times a year.

     Produced by Public Affairs Information Service (PAIS), the PAIS
International database is a bibliographic index with abstracts covering the
full range of political, social, and  public policy issues. Coverage includes
documents published worldwide in any of six languages: English, French,
German, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish. The index headings and abstracts are
in English. Topics covered include economic, political, and social issues;
business; finance; law; international trade and relations; public
administration; government; political science; and any topics that are or
might become the subject of legislation. The database covers selected journal
articles, books, statistics, yearbooks, directories, conference, proceedings,
pamphlets, reports, government documents, and microfiche. More than 1,600
journals and over 8,000 monographs are indexed each year.

     PAIS International on Ovid will be available for stand-alone, network,
and online searching. Implementation features will include a Thesaurus and
Database-Specific Limits.

     PAIS International on Ovid will also include Configurable Output Options,
allowing users to define the fields that they view, print, and save.

     Bowker's Books In Print on Ovid will be available for stand-alone and
network searching and is already available via Ovid Online. Special Ovid
features will include Separate Records for each instance of a book title, an
Author Field that indexes an author's name and role (e.g, editor or
illustrator), and a Database-Specific Limits Menu that allows users to narrow
their searches without memorizing complex search codes.

     Produced by Sociological Abstracts, Inc., Sociofile is the leading
research database in the field of sociology and related social sciences,
including anthropology, economics, education, social work, and social policy
and development. The file provides abstracts from more than 2,400 core and
discipline-related serials (1974-present) published worldwide and enhanced
bibliographic citations of relevant entries from Dissertation Abstracts
International (1986-present).

     An Ovid implementation of Sociological Abstracts, the parent database of
Sociofile, is currently available online, and Sociofile will soon be available
for CD-ROM stand-alones and networks, as well as online. Ovid's version
features Automatic Natural Language Mapping to Sociofile's subject headings,
Database-Specific Limits, and a full Thesaurus of Sociological Indexing Terms.

     For more information on the implementations of these CAS and other
databases, contact Ovid Technologies, New York, 212/563-3006, extension 400;
e-mail: sales@ovid.com. Visit Ovid's home page at http://www.ovid.com.

NEWSWIRE ASAP RELOADED ON DIALOG WITH PREDICASTS PRODUCT CODES

     Information Access Company (IAC) has announced that IAC Newswire ASAP
(File 649) has been reloaded on DIALOG with Predicasts Product Codes to
enhance searching capabilities. Also, as part of the Newswire ASAP reload, the
file is now available to non-North American searchers.

     Newswire ASAP provides the full text of wire stories from key worldwide
news sources. Among the wire services currently covered are Business Wire,
Newsbytes, and PR Newswire. It becomes the sixth IAC database on DIALOG to be
reloaded and standardized with DIALOG's uniform fields this year. Uniform
field tags facilitate cross-file searching across the entire DIALOG system.

     Newswire ASAP offers both current and retrospective information on
companies, industries, products, people, trends, and technologies. It provides
historical perspective and current awareness on worldwide events, helpful for
tracking global political and economic news, conducting competitive
intelligence, and monitoring worldwide industry and technology.

     The complete text and indexing of wire stories are usually available for
searching within 36 hours of transmission, according to IAC. All words within
the text are searchable, facilitating searches for quotes, figures, or any
mention of a company name or personal name found in the text. Controlled
vocabulary searching may be used to limit searches to substantive stories
about specific companies, industries, products, people, or events.

     In addition to the standardization, a significant enhancement to topical
searching is now available in Newswire ASAP with the addition of Predicasts
Product Codes. Predicasts Product Codes provide a hierarchical numerical
coding system that enables online searches to focus as broadly or narrowly as
required. Predicasts Product Codes, which include over 21,000 unique codes,
are also available on IAC Promt and IAC Trade and Industry Database, and other
IAC databases. The addition of this coding system enables users to combine
other Predicasts-coded IAC business databases using DIALOG OneSearch.

WILL TODAY'S DATABASES SURVIVE? A QUESTION OF VALUE

     by Leonard M. Fuld

     [Editor's Note: This is the first in a series of three articles by
publishing consultant and writer Leonard Fuld addressing the future of online
databases and the changing information climate. His two subsequent articles
will run in the February and March issues of "IT."]

     The information Ice Age is here. The Internet has opened the information
seeker's mind. Yet, at the same time, it may have begun the Ice Age for
traditional databases. As found on the Internet, information has become cheap
to get and relatively easy to find. Not that the data is necessarily high
quality or even timely; it's just that it's low in cost and may actually meet
the average person's needs. Practically overnight, large numbers of folks who
are not info-junkies or trained information professionals have discovered
electronic information. The big question facing the database producers now is:
"What do we do for an encore?"

     Database publishers should take a lesson from rock-and-roll bands. Like
rock bands, databases have seen evolutionary change: creation, extinction,
absorption, and even enhancement. I remember seeing a family tree of sorts
that tracked the path that rock-and-roll has taken, where particular musicians
have gone, what band they joined, and where they moved next. Databases have
followed a similar course of development. The ones that did not meet a need
died. Those that did meet a need either grew or were merged into larger data
pools.

     Database historians looking back at the late 1990s will likely point to
this period as one of meteoric change. They will indeed have a great deal of
material from which to draw their conclusions. Just examine today's electronic
publishing headlines:

     --   Low cost + sophistication: InfoSeek, an inexpensive Internet search
service, is accessed over 1 million times a day and processes over 500,000
full-text inquiries. The basic monthly subscription charge is $9.95, with
relatively modest search fees for some special services it offers. InfoSeek
Search includes such databases as Associated Press Online, Reuters Business
Report, Commerce Business Daily, and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts. The
service even offers customers the ability to create relatively sophisticated
information filters. These filters will help customers limit the amount of
information they need to see. Has InfoSeek laid down the gauntlet to DIALOG
and LEXIS-NEXIS? You bet. Is this cheap, low-quality information? No, just
reasonable information, inexpensively obtained.

     --   "Have it your way," two lines of attack: PR Newswire, a database
containing corporate press releases from many (but a limited number) of U.S.
corporations, leapfrogged traditional database delivery systems. You can now
tap into PR Newswire directly through the Internet, or you can phone an
automated faxback system. By calling a special number and following the menu
directions, you can order one or a series of press releases--all at no charge
to the caller. Use the phone pad or the keyboard; it makes no difference to PR
Newswire. Either way, you get the data.

     --   Volume discounts: CD-ROMs are making online access to directories
almost obsolete. Why pay thousands of dollars to access countless names online
when you can buy a series of discs that hold over 80 million names, addresses,
and telephone numbers for approximately $100?

     Instead of heeding these warning signals and racing to upgrade their
products or the means to deliver their products, many publishers and database
distributors have merely taken baby steps. Some have decided that growth
through acquisition of other databases is the way to fend off competition.
Others have improved their front-end search engine--or at least its
appearance. Is bigger necessarily better? Is prettier better than smarter?
These are questions demanding answers.

     To a certain extent, the larger and richer the database the more valuable
it becomes--up to a point. Big databases take more maintenance and become
difficult to tailor and enhance. Adding fields or features becomes a complex
task, as the data itself has become less uniform, more diverse than its
smaller predecessor. It is very possible future publishers will look back 10
or 20 years from now and view behemoth databases as data dinosaurs, not
malleable or user friendly.

     The survivors, the entities that will actually thrive, will do so because
they have adapted to the new information environment. In this environment,
there will be two classes of databases: those that are low priced, offering
little added value to the user, and those that charge a premium for
specialized data that have been--or can be--massaged.

     The low-priced databases will be forced to practically give away their
files and their data. These database publishers can expect slim margins. Their
users can expect rudimentary results and will not pay a high price for what
they receive. In contrast, the high-priced databases will deliver high-quality
results, not just data. Publishers of such databases will need to maintain the
infrastructure to retain the quality and to constantly add enhancements.

     Most of today's database publishers operate in the high-priced arena and
presumably would like to stay there. All this costs. They have built expensive
support, communications, and data processing facilities. I include the IAC,
Chemical Abstracts, and Derwent databases in this group. Yet the Internet is
forcing the price per unit of raw data down to extremely low levels. The
average consumer, even the corporate librarian pressed by a tight budget,
would rather choose the free alternative than the fee-based one.

     Plummeting database prices have already begun to squeeze the profits out
of the bottom line. Without the margins to support the existing business, the
traditional database publishing infrastructure itself may erode. The result
may be the bankruptcy of certain databases. This would be a loss to both the
publishers and to the public.

ACCESS, ACCURACY, AND ADDED VALUE

     If today's database publishers want to thrive in years ahead, they must
enhance offerings to their information-savvy public by dramatically improving
their product quality. The quality issue goes far beyond spell-checking or
indexing. It goes to the core of the product itself. Future database quality
will be measured by three criteria: access, accuracy, and added value.

     Access refers to the ease of entry into the system and to the data
itself. The more the user has access to the knowledge embedded within a
database, the more useful and user-friendly that database becomes. In
contrast, the greater the black box effect, the less the user will want to
use--or to pay--for that source. For instance, if a searcher needed to find
information on local area networks but just plugged in the term LAN, would the
database find all related terms and technologies? Right now, the answer is hit
or miss. The skilled searcher may know to look for all synonyms, but the
professor, salesperson, purchasing manager, or executive, who is frequently
the ultimate user, may not. Future database publishers will have to cater to
this group of decision-makers; besides, economics will dictate that databases
migrate to this broader population and further away from the librarian who is
often the database gatekeeper. These decision-makers want answers, not merely
data; the services that can most easily provide them with answers will win.

     In the future, access will mean that, despite the fact that searchers may
not have known all the relationships and technical synonyms, they will easily
find the complete answer. And if they can't find it in the high-priced
databases, then they will naturally select the low-priced database
alternatives, despite all the deficiencies and inconveniences they represent.
Even today, if PR Newswire offers some of the news (albeit biased), why should
the cost-conscious manager go to Information Access Corporation's PROMT or to
the Dow Jones or Reuters news services? PR Newswire's content may be biased
and somewhat unstructured, but it's also inexpensive and easy to find. For the
harried manager who just wants information, it may suffice.

     Accuracy is the second criterion and perhaps conceptually the easiest for
today's publishers to meet. Databases filled with errors or poor abstracting
will suffer alongside the more accurate ones. At the same time, error-prone
databases or those lacking specificity will lose against even poorly managed
Internet Usenet groups or Internet-available databases. After all, where is
the benefit in the consumer's eyes? Why pay for only partial or inaccurate
data, when you can get the equivalent for a lot less money?

     Unfortunately, accuracy, while important, remains the least visible of
the three criteria. Typographical errors aside, other types of errors are
elusive, only caught by a few. Once again, the busy manager or academic may
miss the inaccuracies, casting a longer glance at the final bill.

MORE INSIGHT, LESS DATA

     Finally, added value represents the greatest threat--and opportunity--to
database publishers in the 1990s. Database publishers are currently spending
great amounts of money on adding content to their information pool, without
doing much to enhance its value in the eyes of business decision makers (a
large part of the market). Decision makers want fewer, more focused
findings--not more data in the form of paper. Database producers need to add
this value. They need to create information summaries, or maps of the data,
anything that will help the consumer answer questions earlier and more
perceptively. Instead of receiving endless printouts, decision makers want
summaries that will help point them in the right direction. Users want these
systems to identify trends, and to winnow out the valuable from the valueless.
Users, in short, want insight, not just more data.

     Business managers want to receive early warnings of market shifts or a
competitor's new product development. They do not want to read more history
and countless articles repeating the same message over and over again. The
ultimate customers are willing to pay a premium for time-saving notices.

     Many of today's better-constructed databases already have the built-in
structure, the indexing, to offer their users a better end product. In
particular, I am thinking of the Derwent patent databases, Chemical Abstracts,
and the Predicast/IAC series with their specific product and event codes.
These and others like them contain embedded coding that should help these
publishers further enhance their end products' value. Give me a cluster
analysis of patents to help me determine a competitor's technology strategy,
or provide me with signs that a competitor may be changing its target market.
This is added value. In certain cases, third-party vendors offer some of these
solutions today. However, the publishers themselves need to offer these
products. They know their products best and would benefit the most from an
improved, more user-friendly deliverable.

     Either the publishers need to enhance the way they store the data, or
they need to work with concerns that can enhance the front end, the means to
massage the existing data. The more automated a database publisher can make
the product, the more data the user will need. It's a win-win situation for
everyone: the decision-maker as well as the publisher.

     Today's lack of added value has become the greatest barrier--a knowledge
barrier--for the online database world. I know many corporate executives who
refuse to examine the database printouts their library sends them simply
because the volume is too great, or the information gems are too difficult to
identify. The searchers themselves are often at a loss as to how to present
the data in a more sophisticated form. Hence, insights that the database
search could yield never surface. Critical knowledge is missed.

     Currently, the database industry apparently thinks it is delivering
value-added business information--at least as far as the advertisements read.
"Competitive intelligence" and "business intelligence" crop up in the database
press all the time. By and large, database publishers and the systems they use
to distribute the data do little more than group or compile it like pieces of
information. I have seen few products that truly analyze or even save the user
a great deal of time.

     True, publishers have found ways to pool data into blocks of information,
but they have failed to add enough value, to turn this information into
decision-producing intelligence. The information consumer realizes this. The
database community should be warned of the axiom: "Nothing kills a bad product
faster than good advertising." Publishers need to dramatically improve their
value-added offerings or suffer the consequences of dwindling usage.

     Publishers must learn how to mine the value inherent in their products.
Those that do will continue to command the value/price high ground. Their
customers will be equally happy with the improved, time-saving,
decision-producing results they receive.

     Whether or not the database world realizes it, its environment has
already begun to change. With an increasing number of sophisticated electronic
competitors entering this new world, the competitive climate is growing
harsher. The publishers and distributors that survive will be the ones who
recognize and act on this changing information climate.

January 1996

WHAT'S AHEAD FOR 1996?

     Once again "Information Today" is starting off a new year with some
forward thinking by presenting the predictions of a number of executives
selected from varied segments of the information industry. We asked them to
tell us what they foresee developing in the industry and at their companies
during 1996 and beyond.

     Here's a look into the future of one of the most exciting, most
important, and most rapidly evolving industries--one that is taking the world
in new directions. Let's see where some of our industry leaders think we're
headed.

     Morris Goldstein
     Chief Executive Officer
     Information Access Company

     If 1995 was the year of Internet access, then 1996 is the year of the
World Wide Web. It is the beginning of an era in which content, computing, and
telecommunications converge, altering the world's business landscape as we
know it today.

     The center of activity in the computing world will shift from a
client/server platform to the World Wide Web. Large software players (such as
Microsoft, IBM/Lotus, and Oracle), as well as major online services (America
Online, CompuServe, and Microsoft Network, to name a few), will make the Web
environment their number one priority for software and service development.

     As part of this shift, we will see the emergence of groupware
capabilities for the Web, greater ease of use, expanded functionality, and a
dramatic acceleration of information usage among novice end users and
information professionals. In parallel, new publishing ventures will exploit
the commercial potential of the Web by developing low-cost, multimedia
alternatives to traditional print and electronic media, thus helping to expand
the information industry's financial model from a usage-supported paradigm to
one that is partially advertising supported.

     In a related development, specialty services such as executive
recruitment, travel, real estate, financial services, and insurance brokerages
will expand their Web-based offerings, enabling their customers to easily
locate business and leisure opportunities, weigh options, and make competitive
price comparisons.

     As corporations de-emphasize restructuring and reengineering to
concentrate on "top line growth" in order to command leadership positions in
their markets, 1996 will witness center stage growth in the areas of knowledge
creation and ongoing knowledge management. At the core of this opportunity
will be the corporate information specialist, whose expertise in monitoring
the external marketplace and creating actionable knowledge will be critical to
the successful outcome of daily corporate decision making. Companies that are
tuned into the dynamic nature of this process will commit budget funds to the
creation and management of knowledge as a means of stimulating innovation and
revenue growth.

     At the same time, public and academic libraries will develop as the
preferred electronic information "hubs" for their communities and continue to
improve their services by offering remote access to patrons who wish to
utilize the Internet and other electronic services from their dorm rooms,
faculty offices, and homes. For this reason, many libraries will make
significant investments to support access to services that require intelligent
workstations.

     During a period of accelerating paradigm shifts, it's unlikely that the
information industry and even the concept of databases will remain status quo
 . . . but that's a good topic for next year's predictions!


     Steve Arnold
     President
     Arnold Information Technology

     A new medium has been invented in the last 12 months. "Internet" is the
word applied to a cluster of technologies that is blending and breeding at a
very fast rate. A normal publishing year has 12 months; the Internet year has
three months. No one doubts that for the electronic information community,
there are both opportunities and challenges.

     Over the next 12 months, five forces (what I call "vectors") will gain
momentum. The first is rising cost and competitive pressure in traditional
information companies. Particularly stressed will be those firms in legal,
scientific-technical, and professional publishing. The old models are
evolving, and authors are going direct to readers. Governments can no longer
afford to print paper copies of their prodigious output. The Internet is less
costly and does not kill trees.

     Second, the Internet makes available a delivery and content platform that
allows customers to experience information, not just read it. New businesses
will flourish in response to keen customer demand for old information in new
packages. The game model is replacing the reference book model.

     Third, the traditional database world is in the process of transforming
itself from text to a multiobject format. The result is a new syntax and
rhetoric packaged in compound complex digital documents (C2D2). Why just read
about an experiment when one can see it take place and examine the data sets
it generated.

     Fourth, the era of intelligent text processing and agents that perform
value-adding functions once associated with human workers will become part of
the desktop. New online companies will exploit these technologies
aggressively, meeting little or no resistance from established online "brand"
names. There are not enough human indexers or money to pay them. Software is
fast and comparatively economical.

     Fifth, the pace of change will enable the technologically adept and
disable the technologically inept. Companies that refuse to embrace the new
medium will fall far back in the competitive pack.

     The opportunities are unparalleled in the history of communications, not
just electronic publishing. For many firms and individuals, the challenges
have never been greater. One thing is crystal clear--once these vectors of
change have been let loose, they will be difficult to control.


     John J. Regazzi
     President and CEO
     Engineering Information Inc.

     Lately I find myself tossing off a phrase that I believe so well
describes the world today and especially the current nature of the information
industry. I wish I could attribute it to its proper source: "The future," it
goes, "isn't what it used to be."

     It seems a day doesn't go by without at least one article or news story
on the Internet. Whether the story concerns virtual reality programs from PARC
or the confluence of video, audio, and text via computer in the home, or just
old fashioned get-rich-quick scams in cyberspace, news stories abound. And why
not? Once communication lines were opened, the rush to gain knowledge, to
exchange information instantaneously, or just to send some informal messages
to colleagues was unstoppable.

     Dealing with this momentum of information exchange will color all of
1996. The scientific and technical information community, of which I am a
part, will embrace new credos in each of its sectors. Authors will find new
channels of scientific communication; primary publishers will digitize and
disseminate or die; secondary services, perhaps most vulnerable, will need to
rediscover how to link reader and writer by some other means than abstracts
and indexes; libraries will be forced to find a means of controlling
technology, lest they are eroded from within; and readers and researchers will
discover that the systems' "walls of silence" have come down, but that there
are no instant answers in this new digital world. In short, not what it used
to be.

     The year 1996 will also mark, I believe, a landmark, because of the
current breadth and pace of change in the information industry. Soon
researchers and managers will be able to roam the world seeking information
independent of time and space. Whether in an airplane over London or on a
commuter train outside Chicago, you'll be able to send a voice mail message,
a paper copy, or even a video image to your office in New York or Tokyo with
a simple effort. A wider variety of files will be available online and
digitally 24 hours a day, accessible anywhere in the world. The freedom and
breadth of universal access may be the most significant benefits of the new
communication and information technologies of our age. Access, retrieval, and
display technologies will dwarf the capabilities of today, making the fax
machine seem as quaint as the manual typewriter.

     The final shift in this new information world--the shift of
leadership--will be initiated in 1996. Information production and
dissemination, once a labor-intensive task, is fast becoming a process
involving two parts. The production of knowledge will be open to many, as
technology lowers the barriers of entry to the traditional publishing
business. Dissemination, however, will be a capital-intensive business,
reserved for the few who can afford to support global, nonstop markets. The
traditional mainstays of the scientific and technical information
infrastructure--the technical societies, governments, the not-for-profit
associations--will be greatly disadvantaged in this capital-hungry enterprise
and will yield their leadership positions to the multinational, publicly held,
global communications companies now emerging.

     The year 1996 will mark the passing of these and other mantles, and after
that . . . well, you know, the future is not what it used to be.


     Bela Hatvani
     President
     SilverPlatter Information, Inc.

     The year 1996 will see an impressive growth in electronic publishing and
distribution. We are encouraging and, more importantly, facilitating this
growth through our ERL Technology. With ERL, we are not only broadening the
possibilities for access to electronic information, but we are enabling
partners to publish their own ERL-compliant documents through our Partner
Publishing Program. We will expand this program dramatically in 1996, enabling
publishers throughout the world to bring up their own publications in
ERL-compliant form.

     We will continue to work with our partners by equipping them with the
tools that will enable them to create an ordered Worldwide Digital Library on
the Internet. Our program for document management will link the magnificent
compendiums of bibliographic reference files that we distribute for over 100
major information providers to full-text documents in a methodical way through
the Internet, through direct dial to document sources, through fax, and
through other methods.

     We will come out with beta releases of the World Integrated Library of
Documents (WILD thing). This project is focused on creating pieces of
interoperating digital library technology that will enable our collaborating
partners to co-create with SilverPlatter the first of many embryonic and
interconnected digital libraries, which will exploit our base information
store and which will also allow publishers and technology providers to extend
this base.

     We will continue to serve our library and end-user customers with
hassle-free products and services. We will be releasing the Search Advisor,
which enables information intermediaries to put their search strategies into
scripts to allow end users to ask simple questions from a simple interface and
get accurate results.

     This industry is just beginning. We are about to see a sustained
explosion that will continue to grow the industry in a creative and chaotic
way. It is an exciting time for all involved.


     Deborah M. Hull
     Chief Operating Officer
     Ovid Technologies, Inc.

     The year 1995 saw the proliferation of a powerful new model for
information retrieval--the World Wide Web. In spite of its drawbacks, it has
captured the popular imagination in a way that no technology has done since
the introduction of the PC. Just as the PC ultimately transformed the working
world even without living up to its touted potential in the home, the Web will
change forever the way that information retrieval is perceived. As a
distributed, client/server model that is easy to use and develop, the Web
makes manifest that information retrieval is for anyone, that it cannot be
contained within one collection or product, and that adherence to standards
can bring a certain unity and presence to what has previously been a
staggering variety of products for specialized audiences. The many, and even
serious, information retrieval problems of the Web will not put this genie
back in the bottle.

     At Ovid Technologies, we have already been fully committed to standards
in our products, including Z39.50, SGML, and the NISO Thesaurus. We are
embracing not just the Web but the information retrieval model it implies. Our
client/server system architecture and all our products are designed for
maximum flexibility in fitting into existing environments--locally at a
research site or remotely via our online service. More importantly, we have
built a rich infrastructure for linkages from our databases to other database
products; to local OPAC holdings via Z39.50; to expanded product views via
internal Ovid links (for example, linking all the articles from one issue into
a table of contents or linking a document to one similar to it); and to other
services via URLs. An increasingly important linkage for us is to full text
from bibliographic records; between the various structural elements of full
text; or between cited references and full text. We see our growing full-text
collections as increasingly important in the "post-Web" world, where the end
result of a search is naturally expected to be a document rather than a
citation.

     Although in 1996 many companies will be scrambling to make products and
services on the Web, those of us already in the information retrieval business
will do well to think creatively about bringing the advantages of our type of
products into the simplified, graphic world of the Web. I think that 1996 will
be the year in which information retrieval goes mainstream, affecting even the
"traditional" research models.


     Tim Collins
     Division General Manager and Vice President
     EBSCO Publishing

     Many key issues of 1996 will relate to the struggle to effectively use
technology to integrate numerous products and services into comprehensive
solutions that allow information professionals to provide service to users at
lower costs.

     We will see this with the way information from periodicals is searched
and delivered. Librarians will no longer need to contract with different
vendors for each of the following services: subscription service, current
awareness service, periodical abstract/index databases, online search and
retrieval service, and document delivery service. Companies such as EBSCO
offer services that allow librarians to provide access to table of contents,
abstract, ASCII full text, and image full-text data through one search. The
services provide the ability to order documents or to learn where in the
library these documents are located if they are not available electronically.

     Electronic access to databases will become even more distributed
throughout organizations. More searching will be done directly from faculty
and employee desktops and less will be done from central libraries. School
libraries will provide searching through larger networks in the library, and
the extension of searching to the classroom will become more prevalent. Public
libraries will offer online services through their growing networks and will
begin to provide access to more computers dialing in from homes.

     The World Wide Web will become more and more prevalent and will emerge as
a legitimate source for accessing quality commercial data through
sophisticated search and retrieval software. It will mature and no longer have
the reputation as a fun place to find interesting, but not critical, free
data. Libraries will begin to find themselves competing with consumer online
services and Web sites for the attention of their constituents. Careful
comparison of data being offered by these sources will become critical.

     Primary publishers of consumer titles will experiment with ways to
provide their data inexpensively online to the masses and will look to
advertisers to cover the costs of online service providers much the way they
cover the cost of printers and typesetters now.

     A significant number of primary publishers of scientific, technical, and
medical data will cross the threshold and make their data available
electronically. Many pricing models will be used but, by the end of the year,
some models will emerge as being viable for the long run.

     Customizing services to the unique needs of individual users will become
a more important component of success. As companies struggle to provide
comprehensive solutions that merge multiple products and services it will be
a challenge to include the customization that each separate product and
service provided when it was offered alone.

     The provision of training and support to library professionals on the use
of these services will be an important factor in the purchase decisions at
small libraries as well as for large state-wide projects.

     Competition will be fierce among information service providers as they
struggle to establish or maintain their place in this rapidly changing
industry. Those that will be successful will be the ones that integrate
technology effectively and provide practical solutions at reasonable prices.


     Joe Bremner
     President
     Database Development

     As always, there seem to be more questions than answers. It is good to
see that the publishing industry--not the telephone or computer companies--is
absorbing the electronic information business. Significant acquisitions have
been made by companies like Wolters Kluwer, Thomson, Reed/Elsevier,
Knight-Ridder, and Pearson.

     In the last Commerce Department survey, the U.S. publishing industry and
related services had total revenues of nearly $200 billion, while the
electronic information industry (separately classified by the Commerce
Depart-ment) was approximately $15 billion. There was no way that this $200
billion industry was going to sit by and watch someone else steal its
franchise.

     We have argued for many years that the ascendancy and growth of the
"online business" was really a publishing anomaly that would be absorbed into
the publishing industry once its capabilities and potential capabilities
matured and were recognized. Those capabilities include its being a natural
successor to the structures in place in the publishing industry for
researching, assembling, editing, presenting, and distributing all types of
information.

     The publishing industry understands these processes better than any of
the other competitors who are scrambling to define the multimedia future. The
depth and diversity of the skills present in the publishing industry will
challenge the ability of computer or telecommunications players; it is not at
all clear that the rapidly conglomerating "entertainment" or "multimedia"
conglomerates will have significant scale or distribution advantages.

     Why? Well, of course, it's the Internet, which, stated another way, is an
open network that provides a kind of access to distribution for small players,
a development that may be unique in industrial history.

     What does this view of the future mean? One of the significant effects of
technology in this environment will be continued disintermediation of
aggregators and distributors. In an open network environment, how does one
define where WESTLAW ends and America Online begins? Given the passable job
that existing intelligent information agents do, and imagining how much more
powerful their successors will be, won't these tools further level the
distribution playing field--the open Internet-based playing field?

     Do the fits and starts of the Microsoft Network reveal a lack of
strategic "publishing" skills mentioned above? If the playing field remains
open, and the technology exists, publishers will create their own electronic
environments, target their traditional audiences--programmers, pilots, brides,
bankers, business managers--and bring them to that environment, using all of
the skills that helped them "own" those audiences in the past, and they may
not need Microsoft or other online services to help them.

     What will this mean for players like UMI, NEXIS, and ISI? Will they be
able to develop value-added services to maintain their holds on distribution
rights granted by publishers?

     The only thing I am certain of is that life will be exciting.


     Dr. K. Wayne Smith
     President and CEO
     OCLC Online Computer Library Center Inc.

     In 1996, we expect to continue pursuing our public purposes of furthering
access to the world's information and of reducing information costs. We will
also continue to aggressively pursue our goals of making OCLC's services
available around the clock, around the world.

     In 1996, we believe the OCLC community of 21,000 libraries in the U.S.
and 61 other countries will be thinking most about the following:

     1)   The Internet, the World Wide Web, and Web software will continue to
          grab headlines and shift paradigms. They will impact planning for
          library services at the local, regional, national, and international
          levels.

     2)   Libraries will increasingly bring their organizational and retrieval
          skills to bear on the Internet. They will start helping people find
          information on the Internet.

     3)   Libraries will continue to move closer to their dream of an
          electronic virtual library that integrates technical services,
          public services, archiving, and other library functions into a
          unified whole. More library patrons will log on to their libraries
          from their homes or offices.

     4)   As the pace of technological change quickens, the gap between
          information haves and have-nots will continue to grow. Libraries
          already recognize this growing gap and will try to narrow it.

     5)   Electronic scholarly publishing will begin to come of age in 1996.
          There will be a critical mass of electronic journals available from
          publishers that will provide libraries with new service and
          collection options and readers with a new way of accessing journal
          information.

     OCLC will be active on all of these fronts in 1996, from developing a
Java interface for its electronic journals to leading 185 libraries in an
Internet resource cataloging project, to offering financial subsidies for
libraries to trade in their older workstations for state-of-the-art machines,
to providing new products and services that will further reduce libraries'
costs.

     The OCLC community will mark the 25th anniversary of the OCLC Online
Union Catalog (OLUC) in 1996. With its 34 million records, some 600 million
location listings, and its more than 4,000 years of recorded knowledge in 360
languages, the OLUC has become a unique information resource highly valued by
scholars and researchers around the globe. It is a good example of what is
possible and probable on the emerging, global, digital, information highway.


     Patrick J. Tierney
     President and CEO
     Knight-Ridder Information, Inc.

     Organizational reengineering, converging technologies, and global
economics are inexorably reshaping the way organizations use information.
Managers must recognize that productivity is key, and no single information
product can satisfy all the requirements of all information users.

     Increasingly, information specialists, our core customers, are redefining
the function of the information center to make the best use of new
technologies, to build and manage organizational knowledge, and to deliver
information throughout the organization. They are being asked to serve as
consultants as well as researchers; to provide a "virtual library," available
24 hours a day to the desktop; to synthesize information from both internal
and external sources, including the Internet; and to deliver it to their
corporate clients. At the same time, their clients are becoming more
information-savvy and are placing ever greater demands on them as information
specialists.

     To meet their needs, Knight-Ridder Information is focusing its efforts on
providing integrated information solutions -- those that enable these
specialists to gather and deliver information quickly on an enterprise-wide
basis. One key product, KR ProBase, was introduced in Europe and North America
in 1995. Its familiar Windows-based interface gives searchers fast, easy,
point-and-click access to the outstanding collection of DataStar
databases--without learning a new search language. In 1996, we will extend
that convenience to the DIALOG service as well.

     The Internet has become the hot new medium for communications, and more
and more, it is an advertising-based medium, which will have a dramatic impact
on the future of services developed for it. At the same time, the "Intranet,"
or internal network utilizing Internet technologies, is emerging as a way to
build information sharing systems, which can blend internal and external
information sources for use throughout the organization.  Taking advantage of
the opportunity to bring information solutions to the desktop, we are
introducing the first two products in a new line of end-user services: KR
BusinessBase for the Windows operating system and KR ScienceBase for the World
Wide Web. And to ensure network-based document delivery, our 1995 acquisition
of The UnCover Company will permit us to significantly enhance our KR
SourceOne delivery service.

     The changes we are observing are not restricted to the U.S. As
technological advancements circle the globe, there is an increasing worldwide
demand for easy access to local information, and in many cases we see
technologies such as wireless communications that leapfrog the existing
infrastructure. Our KR Global-Reach service was developed to meet this need.
Introduced in 1995 and rapidly expanding, KR GlobalReach uses the Internet to
bring vital regional data to countries around the world, in their local
business languages.

     As we enter 1996, we are at the dawn of a new era of customer
expectations for information services. To meet those expectations, information
service pro-viders must go beyond our traditional offerings to create an
integrated suite of new and innovative tools that help information
professionals extend their reach into all functions of their organizations and
help information users increase their overall productivity.

     President

     When I was younger, nothing used to turn me off to a discussion more than
when one of my seniors would say that something had already been tried or
done. Using a past experience to win an argument seemed irrelevant and unfair.
They were saying, in effect, that "There is nothing new under the sun," which
can destroy one's sense of adventure and discovery.

     However, now that I've been in the electronic information business for
over 25 years, I find myself in the position of feeling compelled to recall a
few pieces of history in order to justify my predictions for the future.

     In the mid-1970s, after a few years of relative obscurity, online
services such as DIALOG and SDC Orbit began to assert themselves as viable
tools for information delivery. In 1975 I happened to be in charge of
marketing at Data Courier, and I remember online royalties for our ABI/Inform
database reaching $40,000 that year, an amount we considered quite good.
Today, UMI, which now owns that database, enjoys online royalties in the
millions.

     But the story doesn't end there. Because the word spread that there was
money to be made in online information, a kind of gold rush mentality swept
over the information publishing community, and databases of every shape, size,
and subject began appearing on one online service or another. Putting
something up online seemed to be the straightest path to fame and fortune.

     What people tended to forget, however, was that online users were
actually being asked to pay for the information they retrieved, and it turned
out that putting something up online didn't make it irresistible. There were
many more databases that produced very little revenue or failed altogether
than there were success stories such as ABI/Inform.

     Similarly, in the late '80s and early '90s, CD-ROM technology burst upon
the scene, and the gold rush began again. I wonder how many CD-ROM discs are
gathering dust in publishers' warehouses because people simply didn't want or
need the information they contain, no matter how attractive the technology was
or is.

     We now find ourselves faced with a new technology, the Internet, and the
frenzy has started all over again. Getting something up on the Internet,
establishing a site on the World Wide Web--surely this is the path to fame and
fortune in the mid-'90s and beyond.

     Somehow I doubt it.

     What I really think will happen, and here comes my prediction, is that
the zillion or so Internet users will come to understand in 1996 that really
valuable, accurate, reliable information comes with a price tag--just as it
always did in print, on microfilm, on CD-ROM, or online. Solid intellectual
property costs money. And if it costs money, then it better serve a real need.
Marshall McLuhan notwithstanding, the medium isn't the message. The message is
the message.

     Therefore, I hereby declare 1996 to be the "Year of Content." (Accent on
the first syllable of "content.") And my advice to publishers is to first make
sure you've got something people really want, regardless of the medium of
delivery, before investing time and money in the technology du jour. The
consumer is wiser than we may like to believe.

QUINT'S ONLINE: Censorship as Marketing Opportunity

     By Barbara Quint

     What this country needs is some good five-cent censors.

     Before you report me to the ACLU or have me barred from the next dinner
dance of the American Library Association's Intellectual Freedom Committee,
let me explain. On second thought, go ahead and report me. It's a free
country. I can say whatever I want. On third thought, maybe I will amplify my
remarks. Expensive market studies have shown that readers of leading trade
press publications dislike one-paragraph columns. See how quickly commercial
interest can affect political correctness!

     Harry Cohn, the much maligned movie mogul who founded Columbia
Pictures--and of whom, observing the large crowd at Cohn's funeral, comic Red
Skelton remarked, "Just goes to show. Give the people what they want and
they'll turn out."--anyway, Harry Cohn used to drive producers and directors
nuts with his somewhat vulgar test for whether a picture worked or not. It
concerned an itch in his posterior regions. Regardless of the anatomical
location, any good marketer or product designer better have an innate gift for
recognizing rashes and other allergic reactions when it comes to consumers.
The best and most successful products scratch itches, wherever they may occur.

     Censorship is an itch of long standing, an itch that crawled out of the
caves with the human animal, an itch that won't go away. Considered on its
broadest level, maybe it shouldn't go away. Review your own lives, especially
those of you over a certain age (and any age is a certain age). Don't you find
yourself almost as appreciative of some of the things you have never known,
never heard, never thought of as you are of the things that you have? How many
of us shake our heads and tsk-tsk at the deplorable depravities of the "other
generation"? Of course, what each person considers depravity varies. For some
it may mean ladies without hats and gloves on a public street; for others it
means ladies of the street. Some may condemn rap music ("Albums to Commit
Felonies By"), others New Age sound ("Will somebody PUH-LEEZ shut that
elevator door?!").

     Basically most people want to engineer silences as well as sounds.
Perhaps we all should be intellectual and spiritual "tabulae rasae," cool
dudes open to all experiences. Then again, maybe many of us are already double
parked, too busy with the problems at hand to reflect on problems
unrecognized. Or maybe our personal learning styles only absorb and create
true knowledge in a quiet corner huddled around a limited and manageable array
of data. Hurricanes of data can lead even the chronically curious to shut the
door on an open mind--at least until the winds die down.

     And so people turn to censorship, to systems that shut off information
flow. The more massive the data flow and the more stress factors related to
the data content, the more the censorship reaction occurs. Can we stop it? No.
Should we try to stop it? Maybe not.

A P.C. DISCLAIMER

     A brief pause for political correctness. In this column, my definition of
censorship is very broad. The dark side of censorship usually occurs when
people try to control not just what they themselves experience, but what
others can experience as well. Although people may have a right to not listen,
to not research, to not have to argue their positions, they don't necessarily
have the right to force on others the same silence or to deny others the
information needed to satisfy personal goals and beliefs.

     Borderline areas occur when one person does have legitimate
responsibility for the minds of others, such as parents for children or
teachers for pupils. As a rule, the closer the monitor and the monitored come
to a peer relationship, the less the legitimacy of the control. So parents of
2-year-olds have more right to control the perceived reality of their progeny
than parents of 12-year-olds, and practically none over 22-year-olds.
Kindergarten teachers have more sway than college professors. Employers may
even have some rights over the minds of employees--at least when they're
paying the employees for their "thought time" and for the information services
they use to support the thinking. (Has anyone seen that America Online
commercial where the guy laughs that his boss doesn't know he's really playing
games at work? Censor!!)

     The demands of alternative values or alternative scenarios for reaching
the same ends can also complicate issues of censorship. People oppose
censorship because they do not want truth silenced, but people support
censorship because they do not want truth buried under a deluge of lies,
half-truths, and noise. Even ardent defenders of academic freedom, for
example, will often still endure the "censorship" of the peer review standards
of scholarship.

     Democratic governments have longstanding barriers erected by
constitutional law against controlling the minds and mouths of the individuals
the governments serve. Most protections against censorship focus on government
as censor, probably because of the inequality of power between individuals and
"city halls." However, a government's obligation to protect the lives of its
constituents elicits constitutionally valid exemptions, as in the classic
metaphor of "crying 'Fire!' in a crowded theater."

FILTERS NOT CENSORS

     Let's focus on "authorized censors," those authorized by the very best
authorities--individual users shaping their own information environments. When
searchers go shopping, they often look for what vendors won't provide them as
well as for what they will. Rather than censorship products, perhaps we need
a new name for these "wanted-information-only" services. What about
information filters? Some information filter services follow traditional
product lines, yet perhaps use more high-tech production modes. Others
constitute software that the individual can apply or ignore to suit particular
information flow problems. Others form the basis for developing new
information environments.

     Of course, all database designers censor merely by setting rules of
inclusion and exclusion and defining scopes of coverage. The Internet may have
brought back the '60s, tie-dye morality (or amorality, depending on your world
view), but even the most complacent among us would have to admit that
commercial online sources represent The Establishment. Actually some databases
have biases that can be useful. Look at PR Newswire, the collection of
electronic press releases, the "company line online," so to speak.

     Frankly, PR Newswire often serves as a useful filter. For one thing, it's
honest about its biases. Business articles that appear in newspapers or the
trade press usually invoke some journalistic credibility, although they often
consist only of rehashed press releases. Then again, sometimes searchers don't
want critical, investigative reporting; they just want the official line. And
sometimes knowledgeable experts get too cute, and the official line turns out
to be the truth after all. In any case, it's convenient to have a database
that filters for the "official" version of reality.

     Electronic mail management software has grown more sophisticated as the
threat to users' time schedules has grown more dire. Any e-mail and listserv
user who travels out of town for a week or more can tell you of the cold
terror awaiting on return to base. Why do you think they sell so many laptop
computers? They're defense mechanisms from online overload. "Post-Boolean"
search engines in some e-mail managers can now rank messages by relevance,
allowing users to set priority levels. Online e-mail managers can sometimes do
the same. Do users ever miss anything important? Maybe, but some users may
decide it's better than losing large chunks of every workday.

     It's not only e-mail that needs filters. Many voicemail systems offer the
option of ranking messages. And why do you think they put speakers on your
answering machine? Of course, none of us would ever be rude enough to not pick
up the phone until we identified the caller and maybe the reason for the call.
Naah!

     The Internet's propensity for electronic frontier freedom has led to the
introduction of "real" censors. Trying to avoid lawsuits, bad press, and
Congressional virtue, vendors have started supplying rating and blocking
tools, like the V-chip, against "naughty bits." As the Internet continues its
inevitable march, the need to categorize and rank content will increase.
Already services such as the McKinley Group and Point Communications promise
to identify the "best" and most reliable Web sites.

     As television and the home computer overlap, new product opportunities
may arise. Frankly, cable television, not to mention direct satellite
broadcasting, is already out of hand. Even with a "TV Guide," you cannot
identify everything you could view at any given moment. As an occasional
C-SPAN binger, I was overjoyed to see a forum from them on the new Microsoft
Network (MSN). Imagine my dismay when it turned out that they only loaded the
previous day's schedule. What the heck good is that? But if I had an online
guide to all of the C-SPAN schedule along with all of the other cable and free
television broadcasts, I could start to craft an infotainment product of my
own. If the computer could turn the television and/or VCR on and off, the
online guide could form the basis for filtering mechanisms.

     The other day I saw a rather rowdy panel on C-SPAN where several major
television producers pounded on a congressman advocating the V-chip. The
producers didn't want any rating system for violence, electronic or otherwise,
because they think it will deter advertiser support and effectively censor
some shows off the air because of removed funding. On the other hand, the
bluntest opponent of the V-chip inadvertently admitted his own censoring
habits. Children under 5 in his household cannot watch any television. They
can only watch videotapes from Disney. His personal parental programming got
me to wondering. What happens after age 6?

     When I was 6 and 7 and 8 and so forth, television operated under a rigid
broadcasting code that only allowed the pure of heart and mouth on the air.
Now that's not going to happen these days, and maybe it's for the best. On the
other hand, I'm not sure that Bart Simpson or the Terminator is desirable as
a universal role model for impressionable youth either. Maybe parents could
program restricted access during the daylight hours or when they're not home.
American Movie Classics or Turner Classic Movies show flicks filmed under
equally restrictive codes. Nickelodeon shows old television and kid programs.
For youthful viewing, we could add program selections from PBS stations,
Discovery Channel, TLC (The Learning Channel), and maybe some news broadcasts.

     Of course, some people would put a Boolean NOT in front of all those
selections and turn their filters the opposite direction. Hey! It's a free
country.

     Regardless of the product produced, information vendors should keep
monitoring users for situations that lead to complaints about too much data
noise or too much of the wrong kind of information stimuli. Battered consumers
are a market opportunity. Remember, "silence is golden."

DATABASE REVIEW: THREE NEW DATABASES EXTEND DIALOG BUSINESS AND SCI-TECH
DATA LEAD

     By Mick O'Leary

     The year 1995 was one of furious activity in the arena of online business
information. Three major services--DataTimes, Profound, and NewsNet--received
extensive makeovers, involving colorful GUIs, new pricing schemes, and more
databases. This occurred in a climate of anticipation around new market
entrants, such as Microsoft Network, which has content from many leading
business database producers, and forthcoming services from AT&T and MCI. Amid
all of this hype, some of the other established services may appear to be a
little behind the curve. Even venerable DIALOG looks like it has some catching
up to do.

     In recent years DIALOG, with its pricing scheme that still depends
heavily on connect rate and its lack of a flashy, graphics-laden GUI, has
lagged behind some industry trends. Nevertheless, when it comes down to
content, DIALOG is still looking over its shoulder at the followers. Although
others may proclaim themselves as the "leading" or "most comprehensive"
business service, DIALOG is unrivaled or, at least, unsurpassed. The
definition of the "best" business service is in the eye of the beholder, but
by several definitions, DIALOG remains top dog. For its coverage of companies
and industries, for its depth of U.S. and international information, and for
its collection of textual, numeric, and directory files, DIALOG can make the
strongest claim for being the most comprehensive online business service.

     Three new business databases announced on DIALOG during the fall
strengthen its position. Two of them, D&B European Financial Records and
Kompass Eastern Europe, enrich DIALOG's large collection of company databases.
The third, International Business Directory, fits with DIALOG's strengths in
both business and sci-tech information.

NEW DATA FROM D&B

     DIALOG and Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) have long been one of the strongest
online service/database producer partnerships. DIALOG was the first external
supplier for D&B and remains a major third party host for D&B databases. The
newest database, D&B European Financial Records, extends DIALOG's set of
detailed financial data to non-U.S. companies. European Financial Records is
comparable to Duns Financial Records Plus, which contains financials for over
a million U.S. businesses, nearly all of which are privately held.

     European Financial Records (EFR) covers 2.4 million businesses in 13
Western European nations. Those most heavily represented are the U.K., France,
the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, and Italy, with smaller numbers of records
from Germany, Portugal, Ireland, Luxembourg, Monaco, Andorra, and San Marino.

     The data in an EFR record is similar to that found in Duns Financial
Records Plus:

     --   Company profile with name, address, phone, primary and secondary SIC
          codes, officers, number of employees, banks, premises, and year
          started

     --   Corporate family, including subsidiaries with percentage of
          ownership, branches, and immediate parent

     --   Financials (including sales, profits, net worth, assets,
          liabilities, debts, and capital), assets and liabilities broken down
          into over a dozen items, and three years of annual totals expressed
          both in local currency and in U.S. dollars

     --   Thirteen key ratios, with three-year annual totals

     Most of these fields are searchable, so that a record can be customized
to almost any desired set of fields. The ability to pick and choose among data
elements is welcome in this expensive database--a full record is $75 and
connect rate is $90/hr.

     EFR must be used with the same caveats that apply to DFR and other D&B
databases. Many company records are not complete and may have only summary
financial information. Figures may be D&B estimates when data from the company
itself are absent. Financials are also based on annual totals, which may not
reveal the company's current situation.

KOMPASS LINE EXPANDS

     European company information is also the focus of the latest in the
Kompass series. Unlike the D&B files, which concentrate on financial data, the
Kompass databases emphasize product information with detailed product listings
from thousands of companies worldwide.

     The Kompass databases are produced by an international consortium of
business directory publishers. Other Kompass databases cover Western Europe,
the U.K., and the Asia/Pacific region, as well as several individual
countries. They concentrate on manufacturing and industrial firms that sell
business-to-business, including related service companies. Kompass Eastern
Europe lists 100,000 companies from Russia, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Croatia, and the Yugoslav region.

     A Kompass record provides a brief company profile containing name,
address, phone, fax, type of business (manufacturer, distributor, etc.),
industry sector, sales, number of employees, principal officers, and summary
parent/subsidiary information. Product line information is more specific, with
a thorough listing of the company's products and services. They are arranged
according to the Universal Commodity System, a classification widely used in
Europe. The system classifies 45,000 different products and services, allowing
for precise description of a company's product line.

     Most fields in a Kompass record are searchable. Product terms are
arranged hierarchically so that a search on a broad product class will
retrieve all of the more specific subclasses within it. Befitting Kompass'
wordly flavor, records can be obtained in English, German, French, Spanish, or
Italian; product names can be searched in any of the languages. The records
for each country are updated annually on a rotating basis; thus, at any time
a given record may be substantially out of date. Kompass Eastern Europe is
exclusively on DIALOG, where it joins several other Kompass files.

TECHNOLOGIES FOR TRANSFER

     The International Business Directory is misnamed, since it is actually a
directory of technologies for transfer from both profit and nonprofit
organizations. It is based on the The World Bank of Licensable Technology, a
directory produced by the Canadian Industrial Innovation Centre.

     The database lists over 26,000 technologies that can be licensed in
manufacturing, chemicals, electronics, medicine, agriculture, energy,
construction, and communications. Technology descriptions are provided by
hundreds of licensing organizations including companies, research labs,
universities, and government agencies. The directory is international, with
input from over three dozen countries, although three-quarters of the content
comes from the U.S., the U.K., and Canada.

     Each record briefly describes the technology, its uses and advantages,
development stage, patent number, and licensing terms. Not all records have
this complete description; many have only summary descriptions and may lack
other record elements. Records also contain supplier information, industry
sector names, and a contact person. Most record fields are searchable.

     The International Business Directory is DIALOG exclusive. As a mixed
business and technical database, it is a small but useful addition to DIALOG's
great collections in each area. DIALOG's status as the leading business
service may be subject to honest dispute, but as the best common source for
business and sci-tech data, there is no question.

     [Mick O'Leary has been using and writing about online information for
over 15 years. He is the director of the library at Frederick, Maryland, and
a principal in The Data Brokers, an information consultancy.]


                       D&B EUROPEAN FINANCIAL RECORDS
                           KOMPASS EASTERN EUROPE
                      INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS DIRECTORY

     SYNOPSIS

          Three new business/product directories provide detailed financial
     and product information for millions of companies, especially in Europe.
     They extend DIALOG's unsurpassed collection of company and business
     databases.

LEGAL LINE: LAW FIRM HOME PAGES MADE EASY

     By Cary Griffith

     One of the most memorable announcements of 1995 was West Publishing's
plans to create home pages for the more than 800,000 attorneys listed in
"West's Legal Directory." At the time, it was the kind of announcement that
surprised many people, considering the amount of work the project would
require. But now two occurrences make West's announcement even more memorable.

     Six months after the announcement, the legal industry is beginning to see
the results of West's labors. These results are worth some examination.

LEGAL INDUSTRY INTEREST IN THE INTERNET IS GROWING

     In six months the legal industry's attention to the Internet has gone
from marginal interest on the part of a few practicing attorneys to something
much more significant. How significant? An anecdotal survey of large law
offices finds that, of the dozen or so contacted, all either had home pages,
were contemplating home pages, or at the very least had Internet access. For
some their presence may be limited to simple access through a local Internet
provider. But if you ever get on the Internet with a World Wide Web (WWW)
browser, you'll find that the legal industry's Internet presence is taking
some interesting turns.

     At the 1995 ABA TechShow, the Internet presentations were among the most
attended sessions. At the time (March 1995), over 50 medium or large law firms
were listed as having WWW home pages. Today, even barring West's announced
home page development, the number is too great to count and still growing.

     Why are law offices expressing an interest in WWW home page development?

     "It allows people in the general public to obtain information about a
firm without any barriers," says Joe Lester, a Bloomington, Minnesota,
attorney who offers a Web site focusing on business and technology law
(http://www.mnlaw.com). Like many other Internet observers, Lester points to
two important features that make an Internet presence worth considering,
particularly for law offices.

     Once a home page is located, most provide the researcher with a variety
of information they can't find anyplace else: links to examples of the
attorney's work or links to related home pages or subjects that can be very
useful.

     "It's an alternative to going to a printed directory," explains Lester.
"You can [do a] search, based upon categories of information, that would lead
you to a variety of firms, and then from there, link into more specific types
of information that may or may not be of interest."

     Another reason Internet observers like Lester are pointing to the
importance of an Internet presence is because of the advertising/marketing
exposure. "For the firm it is extremely high-value marketing. The firm can
provide useful information, at a very low cost, that's much more accessible
than traditional print advertising or directories."

WEST'S HOME PAGE PROGRAM

     Given the growing importance of having an Internet presence, many firms
are trying to figure out how to get started, without realizing they may
already have a WWW home page.

     According to a press release dated August 3, 1995, West Publishing was in
the midst of creating "home pages for all of more than 800,000 profiles
contained within West's Legal Directory (WLD) . . . West Publishing will
create a WWW home page for each of the private practice attorneys, law firms,
corporate counsel, government attorneys, and other legal professionals listed
on WLD. Each home page is accessible free of charge to users browsing the WWW
and to clients interested in gathering information on legal professionals."

     Part of West's continued development includes improving the e-mail field
for each WLD profile so individuals have easier access to Internet e-mail. And
each professional's WLD profile will have an Internet URL field. The URL field
will link the user to the firm or attorney home page. In this way WLD will
become a locator for each attorney's home page.

     The preceding commits to a significant amount of home page development.
Unfortunately, in many cases those home pages will not reach their full
potential. Unless attorneys take an interest in their home pages, they won't
provide any more information than what's already noted in their WLD listing.
But it's worth noting that West's press release went on to state that "in
addition, West is offering an opportunity for law firms to customize the
design and information contained with their Internet home page."

     For a sample of an informative home page design, consider the law offices
of Briggs and Morgan (http://www.briggs.com). Internet users accessing this
site first view an introductory page like the one depicted in Figure 1.

     The introductory screen contains little more than the Briggs and Morgan
logo and a phone number. But notice the reference to "Briggs and Morgan's Web
Pages." The plural is significant, because if you scroll through Briggs'
introductory screen you'll find it's actually very brief. In fact, the entire
home page takes up approximately three screens. But each Briggs screen is
packed with a lot of information, and the details can be acquired by simply
pointing and clicking.

     Anyone who has spent much time browsing the Internet will recognize this
design. The beauty of the Briggs page is in its simple design and in the way
it leaves further perusal to the browser. For example, if I wanted to view the
biographical listing for a Briggs attorney, I could simply click on the
Profiles icon (third from left near the middle of the screen--see Figure 2).
That takes you to a list of Briggs and Morgan Attorney Profiles, which

YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR

     How much does it cost to get West's assistance in creating a customized
home page on the Internet? According to West, it depends on what you want to
list. But general costs can be anywhere from $1,500 per year (for solo
practitioners) to several thousand dollars a year for a large law firm with a
very detailed listing. The price really depends on firm size and on the
complexity, layout, and content of the home page design.

     However, if a law firm compared the prices of outsourcing or setting up
a home page itself (design of home page, establishing themselves as a WWW
site, etc.), the costs would easily exceed $30,000. Similarly, if a firm
outsourced the design of a home page and rented space with a local Internet
provider (to house the home page) the approximate annual costs could be as
much as $9,000.

     West offers an extremely comprehensive service, guaranteeing what it
calls 7/24: The home pages are available seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
West also offers a directory that can be searched in a variety of complex
ways, enabling users to find home pages for attorneys they would otherwise
have to find through other, weaker search engines.

     Interested users can view a demonstration firm site on the Internet.
Tennyson & Keye, a fictitious law firm West created as an example of its WWW
home page services, can be found at http://demo.wld.com. If you have the right
equipment, you can even view the Tennyson & Keye home page's video
presentation.

     One surmises that West is offering all firms a home page as both an
enhancement of its directory and as a way to give those attorneys not
currently participating with a full page in the directory more enticement to
do so.

     Nothing in life is free, but if you compare the price of going out and
creating your own home page (a process I'm in the middle of--and I expect it's
going to cost around $50 per month, which doesn't include the actual page
creation), West's deal looks very good.

CONCLUSION

     1995 was a year of both remarkable news and phenomenal growth on the
Internet. On occasion, both of these phenomena intersected. West's
announcement regarding home page development was the kind of intersection most
attorneys appreciated.

     Providing home pages for the attorneys listed in WLD not only makes
marketing sense for WLD but also presents a great marketing opportunity for
every attorney practicing today.

CD-ROM COMMENTARIES: WHAT WILL DRIVE CD-ROM DRIVES IN 1996?

     By Peter Jacso

     Survival instinct, that's what will drive them. CD-ROM drive
manufacturers (and CD-ROM database publishers) have been under a great deal of
pressure lately from all sides. The phenomenal growth of Internet access, the
plummeting price of hard disks with gigabytes of capacity, the incredibly
successful ZIP drives of Iomega, the launching of the phase-change dual
technology (PD) discs, and the promise of super-high-density discs prompted
many industry observers to write obituaries for CD-ROM.

Count me out. I still believe in the feasibility of CD-ROMs. There have been
constant improvements in CD-ROM technology. We saw some of this in 1995; more
will come in 1996.

TRANSFER RATE IMPROVEMENTS

     CD-ROM drives had been tagging along at the 150 KB/second transfer rate
for quite a time, until the first double-speed (2x) drives--transferring 300
KB of data per second--appeared on the market in 1992. Single-speed drives
were acceptable for text and audio databases. Single-speed, however, turned
out to be inappropriate for animation and the first video clips, even if they
were of postage stamp size. This ushered in first the double-speed and, in
1993, the unusual triple-speed (3x) drives from NEC. They were followed in
1994 by the first quadruple-speed (4x) drives and another odd drive, the
quintuple-speed from NEC. There are other drives with odd transfer rates, such
as the 4.5-speed Toshiba, Panasonic, and Plextor models, and the 4.4-speed
Pioneer.

     The rate at which transfer speed has been increasing since 1992 has been
quite impressive. It was obvious that we wouldn't have to wait long for
sextuple-speed drives, and, indeed, in 1995 they arrived from NEC, Plextor,
and TEAC. Mitsumi, the number-one drive manufacturer for OEM purposes due to
its low prices, has a 6x drive for less than $300 (which translates to about
a $200 OEM price). This time, Mitsumi doesn't skimp on buffer size, featuring
a 128 K buffer. Toshiba demonstrated its 6.7-speed XM-3701 drives (in both
internal and external versions) at Fall COMDEX. Why 6.7x? Because it just
breaks the 1 MB/second transfer rate and is certainly a good eye-catcher in
the ads.

     Yes, you guessed right. The first 8x drive--from Diamond--just started
shipping, and NEC and Chinon plan to ship their 8x drives by the time you read
this. Others may join the fray, although I am somewhat skeptical. I wonder if
it is worth stretching the transfer rate further at this time. To achieve this
speed, the discs must be spinning at 4,000-5,000 revolutions per minute,
depending what part of the disc is being read. (Your Walkman spins the disc at
about 450 rpm, for the sake of comparison.) This generates a lot of heat,
noise, and resonance, and may not result in a perceivable performance
improvement for the user.

     Though motion video could benefit from faster transfer rate, it is
unlikely that there will be any multimedia titles that would include video
recorded with a view toward this 1.2 MB/second transfer rate. Title developers
in 1995 still optimized their video compression for the double-speed drives
(still the largest segment of CD-ROM drives). This will probably change this
year for the annually updated or newly released titles, which are likely to be
optimized for a quad-speed, 600 KB/second transfer rate that will become
dominant in drives. Running such titles on drives sporting transfer rates
higher than quad speed is only marginally beneficial, except when files are
copied (instead of being played back) from the CD-ROM, as in the case of
installing program suites.

     Displaying text and playing audio files from an application do not call
for a higher rate than 150 KB/second. Still images shown as a slide show even
with recorded narration are more than happy with a quad-speed transfer rate,
so why torture the mechanical parts of the drive by spinning it madly? It is
like running to the bus stop even when there is no bus in sight. Much more
important is the balanced performance of the drive. Transfer rate is only one
element of the drive's speed. Equally important is the access time of the
drive.

ACCESS TIME IMPROVEMENTS

     In order to transfer data, first the read mechanism has to get to the
appropriate section. This is known as access time, measured in milliseconds
(ms). This has also improved by the same factor as transfer rate over the
10-year timespan, but in a reverse pattern. The first drives had 900- to
1,000-ms access time (and IBM's entry to the field was via a drive with a
pathetically high 1,500-ms access time and a ridiculous price tag of $1,200).
In a year or two, access time halved, then went down to 300- to 350-ms,
stagnated there for a while, and now typically hovers around 200 ms.

     A few current drives and most of the new ones that will come out this
year sport access times of less than 200-ms. This is very important, because
users jump from sector to sector not only in bibliographic databases (e.g.,
when a subject search yields records scattered all around the disc) but also
in multimedia applications (e.g., when a hyperlink is activated to jump from
the article on Hungarian music to the biography of Franz Liszt). It is rather
disappointing (and misleading) when a headline in a good magazine that sells
about a million copies claims that "Speedy 6x Drives Make CD-ROM Searches a
Snap" ("PC World," December 1995). It is akin to saying that faster planes
make getting from New York to Boston a snap. Flying time and commuting time
between the city and the airport together define the effective travel time.
There may be some further improvements in decreasing access time but the
current champion, the Plextor 4Plex with a 135-msec average access time, will
be hard to beat soon.

JUKEBOX IMPROVEMENTS

     For quite a long time Pioneer was the only manufacturer of a jukebox
(CD-ROM changer) accommodating six discs in a cartridge. Then came the
seven-disc version from Mountain Network in 1994. These were a godsend for
such megadatabases as MEDLINE or the CDMARC database from the Library of
Congress. There were significant innovations in late 1995 that will have an
impact on the market in 1996.

     Gateway started to include (for a $100 premium) dual-disc minijukeboxes
last year. NEC released four-disc, then seven-disc minichangers, both with a
quad-speed transfer rate. They had the attractive innovation of not requiring
you to handle the entire cartridge when replacing a disc but just ejecting and
inserting a single disc. The 350-ms access time, however, was a letdown. NEC
probably will improve on both jukeboxes in trying to catch up with the new
six-disc Pioneer changer sporting 4.4x transfer rate and 150-ms average access
time. With the ever increasing availability of ready reference titles, even
home users will demand such CD-ROM changers--at a reasonable price--to hold
several discs on tap. There are super jukeboxes storing hundreds of discs
quasi-online, and these will facilitate the management of such gigantic image
databases as UMI's Business Periodicals Ondisc, Ovid's Core Biomedical
Collection, and other upcoming CD-ROM megadatabases.

PORTABILITY IMPROVEMENTS

     The most visible CD-ROM technology development in 1995 was the
proliferation of CD-ROM drives built into the latest generation of notebook
computers. There are many users, however, who don't have built-in CD-ROM
drives in their notebook computers. Until now, the best they could do was to
have a double-speed CD-ROM drive with a parallel port connector (less commonly
with a PC Card, or PCMCIA, Connector), and with a bulky AC adapter. This
scenario is also going to change.

     There were plenty of stylish, sleek, affordable, and more powerful
portable CD-ROMs at the COMDEX show, and mouth-watering promises for the first
and second quarter of 1996. PC Card-type connection is to become the norm. The
double-speed PacRIM Labs CyberMan CD is remarkable for including a 16-bit,
44-KHz, wavetable synthesis chip and a 256 K buffer in the CD-ROM--which is
multisession-capable and also plays CD-i discs. EXP Computer, Inc. was the
first portable (if somewhat bulky) parallel-port-based CD-ROM player that did
not require an AC adaptor. It now has the drive with a PC Card interface, and
promises to have quadruple- and sextuple-speed drives by June. These, however,
will require an AC adapter because of the significant power consumption.

     CNF Inc. and Chase Advanced Technologies offered the two most stylish and
lightweight double-speed portable drives, the Cardport CD and the DISQ,
respectively, at the very competitive price of $220 to $230. Both companies
promise a 6x portable drive by March or April. Axonix--a longtime provider of
portable CD-ROM drives for notebook computers--has both 4x and 6x variants,
with an amazing 160-ms access time. Axonix is currently testing the
possibility of using the keyboard connector for power supply instead of a
separate adaptor. I am not the only one who would be overjoyed at this,
because in notebook computing every ounce and extra cable count.

     Even at these aggressively increasing transfer rates and moderately
decreasing access times, CD-ROMs will remain an order of magnitude behind
current hard disks on both counts. But they were never meant as hard-disk
replacements. The alternative media and drives (magneto optical, phase-dual,
super-density, the ZIP, and the JAZ) that seem to be threatening CD-ROMs have
their own niche. As we shall see next month, they complement well what CD-ROMs
are used for these days.

CD-ROM REVIEW: "GALE BUSINESS RESOURCES:" GOOD CONTENT, CLUMSY INTERFACE

     By Linda Rosen

     Gale is known throughout the library community for high-quality reference
products in the form of books, online databases, and even CD-ROMs. That's why
it's so puzzling that the company's latest attempt to put many of its volumes
of business reference information on CD-ROM is so clumsy. If it weren't for
some of the useful content in this product it would not be worth looking at as
a viable reference tool for a library. As it currently exists, "Gale Business
Resources" is a misfire that can certainly be recovered if Gale puts some
development and effort into it.

     The main defect in the product is its interface. Amazingly, this is a
DOS-based product. Although there is a "graphical interface" through which the
user can navigate with a mouse, the buttons and screen design throughout are
very "non-standard." By this I mean that when you single-click on a button in
a Windows-based software product, you will get an immediate response. In the
"Gale Business Resources" product, you need to double-click on that button and
even then response is mighty slow. In a discussion with a spokesperson at
Gale, I learned that the intended market for this product was public and
academic libraries, who, Gale decided through its own research, were not using
Windows-based computers and were unlikely to do so until at least later this
year. Since business and corporate libraries were not a target market, Gale
decided to go with the DOS platform only. This is the main reason not to buy
the product now.

CONTENT IS KING

     Interface aside, (but it's extremely hard to ignore it while using the
product), some of the content and ideas that Gale has for the product have
merit. You can't go wrong with standbys like the "Encyclopedia of
Associations," "Companies and Their Brands," "Consultants and Consulting
Organizations Directory," and "Ward's Business Directory" (to name a few).
These appear to be the gems of the product in terms of content. Others include
"American Wholesalers and Distributors Directory;" "Business Rank-ings
Annual;" "Encyclopedia of American Industry;" "Finance, Insurance and Real
Estate USA;" "International Directory of Company Histories;" "Manufacturing
USA;" and "Service Industries USA."

     A total of 30 volumes of Gale's business references with full text of the
"Fortune 1000 Securities and Exchange Commission Reports" (on a separate
CD-ROM) and the "US Industrial Outlook" are also included.

     A selection of Gale products are available on CD-ROM and through online
databases. For example, the "Encyclopedia of Associations" is available in
both of these formats. "Gale Business Resources" brings many of the best Gale
reference products together in one place. The idea is great, but so far the
execution leaves much to be desired.

SEARCHING BY COMPANY, BRANDS, INDUSTRY, EXTENDED

     The main screen (which never leaves you, even if you don't want to see it
in the background the entire time) provides four buttons to begin your
research. So far, so good. But try to click on a button as you might in a
Windows-based application and nothing happens. Click again and finally the
system slogs through to the next screen. If you are used to working in DOS and
have the patience to endure yet another interface that doesn't look like or
behave like anything else you use, you might be willing to use this product.

     You cannot successfully run "Gale Business Resources" in a DOS window if
you are using Windows. The speed degrades so completely that it simply isn't
worth it.

     Select the "Company" button and you are presented with a scroll-type
listing of companies to choose from. The product includes information on
210,000 firms (many are divisions within a company). You have to choose a
company and then look at the brief profile to determine if it's really the one
you want. If you choose Novell as the company, for example, you are presented
with several listings: for Novell, Novell Inc., and Novell Corp., and it's not
initially clear which is the main one you want. You can choose to mark a range
of companies in this screen.

     Once companies have been selected, you can view the details in one of
several formats (Full, Brief, Mailing, or Custom). One company I chose had
only SIC and brands listed but no mailing address information. It's hit or
miss. Move from the Company Information screen to Industry Information, and
you are offered a listing of SIC codes and descriptions for the industries in
which the companies are engaged. Industry Information that's available for
most of the industries on this disc includes Market Share Reports, Rankings,
Articles & Essays, Associa-tions, and Statistics.

     In my quest to find information on the software industry I viewed each of
the items available. Market Share Reports is data culled from Gale's "Market
Share Reporter" and tends to be quite dated, especially for information on
this fast-paced industry. Rankings, too, tended to have data not much more
current than 1993. Articles & Essays appears to come from the "Encyclopedia of
American Industry" and does not include current articles from industry
publications. For the report on software, the very latest information included
was excerpted from a March 1994 article. Articles & Essays should more
properly be called Industry Background and History. Current, it is not.

     The Associations section is, of course, based on the "Encyclopedia of
Associations." This has always been a great product, so it's hard to look bad,
even in this clumsy interface. If your goal is to find associations, however,
the books, online version, or dedicated CD-ROM version are better choices.

     Statistics appear to come mainly from the "U.S. Bureau of the Census and
County Business Patterns." This again is not current data (no fault of Gale),
but Statistics might not be the right moniker for this section--again, it
might be more accurate to call this section U.S. Government Industry
Statistics.

BRANDS AND THEIR COMPANIES, COMPANIES AND THEIR BRANDS

     One of the more useful resources in this product is Gale's "Companies and
Their Brands," searchable through the Product and Brand Name button on the
main menu. You can find information on more than 116,000 brands and 15,000
products in 1,000 industries. The same procedures apply as with a company
search. You choose a brand or product name with a scrollable list, mark the
ones you want, and then look at the companies with which those brands are
associated. You can then move into company or industry information as
described above. Again, if the interface and speed of the product were at all
modern, this could be a very useful tool for finding brand information and
then exploring the companies and industries associated with it.

EXTENDED SEARCH

     Ostensibly, the Extended Search option from the main menu allows you to
simultaneously search multiple fields in the "Gale Business Resources"
database. As the manual suggests: ". . . you could search for all software
companies in California with revenues between $100,000 and $250,000, or all
companies with a 212 area code that manufacture ophthalmic goods." Although
the capability is there, the execution of the interface and the slowness of
the search system bog down this process. The Extended Search is built around
a series of tab cards that each offer a different access point to the data. As
in other parts of the program, the response you get by clicking on these cards
is not what you would expect in a Windows application, but it sort of looks
like it and kind of behaves like it.

     Extended Search "Cards" are available for Contacts (company name,
officers' names, parent company, phone), Location (city, state, ZIP code, area
code), Industry (SIC, industry description), Scope (number of employees, year
founded, revenue, stock exchange, ticker symbol), Profile (description of
business, publications, seminars, and special services offered by the
company), and Products (brand name and description). The concept is good, the
underlying information is uneven, and the search software is inadequate for
this type of sophisticated search. Too bad, it would be great otherwise.

SEC REPORTS AVAILABLE

     If you happen on a company for which an SEC report is available (1,000
10K reports are included for top public companies), you'll see an SEC Report
button to choose in the company profile. Click on this and the system will
prompt you to insert the second CD-ROM, which includes the full text of these
reports. Awkward, but not unreasonable.

A FINAL WORD ON THE INTERFACE

     An additional ongoing problem with the program is the lengthy text
screens that provide no other navigation mechanism than to continually press
the Page Down button on the keyboard or to double-click the mouse on the tiny
More button on the screen. There is no "slider" down the side of the text box
to indicate the length of the article or to be able to quickly navigate
through it. This makes exploration of the Articles & Essays section, for
example, quite painful.

     Information can be printed and exported from any portion of the program.
Exported data is put into an ASCII file and can also be downloaded as comma
delimited. Again, this is a clumsy way to deal with data today. Cutting and
pasting has become second nature to many people. Exporting to an ASCII file
and then bringing the file into a word processor harkens back to dark days of
database searching.

IN CONCLUSION

     The price for" Gale Business Resources" is $7,995 per year and includes
quarterly updates. If you priced out the separate costs for all of the
resources included in this product, the cost of having them on this one disc
is a good deal. However, access to the data is severely affected by the poor
interface and the value of the information is therefore compromised by this
inaccessibility. If you're going to spend nearly $8,000 for a CD-ROM product,
you probably won't be too concerned about buying a PC with Windows. Gale is
missing a great opportunity in corporate libraries and especially in small
businesses where a tool like this could be really valuable.

     Cut down on the price, modernize the interface and search software, and
remove the dated material from "Gale Business Resources," and you might really
have something.

MULTIMEDIA MEDLEY: COMDEX '95 AND MULTIMEDIA IN '96

     By Peter Jacso

     Las Vegas, which I visited recently to attend Fall COMDEX, claims to have
become a family destination. I had my doubts as I waded through the sleazy
complimentary magazines scattered on the sidewalks. But I have never doubted
that Las Vegas was the perfect host for this computer show, which it has been
for the past 17 years.

     The show has been getting bigger and better every year. This time, it
attracted 210,000 visitors and over 2,000 exhibitors. Multimedia was even more
at the heart of the show than it was in 1994, as it came not only from CD-ROMs
but from the hundreds of World Wide Web sites.

     As usual, a visit to COMDEX makes it easy to predict what computers and
information technology applications the next 12 months will bring into our
homes and offices. Here I only give a condensed report of what the multimedia
landscape is likely to look like, but in later columns this year I will
discuss particular issues more closely.

MULTIMEDIA TO GO

     The most impressive trend to me was the coming of age of affordable,
genuine multimedia notebook computers. IBM undoubtedly had the show stopper
with its incredible ThinkPad 760CD, featuring a 90 MHz Pentium, 8 megabytes
(surprisingly low) of RAM, a 12-inch active-matrix screen capable of 16
million colors at 640X480 mode, or 65,000 colors at 800X600 mode, a
1.2-gigabyte hard disk, a quadruple-speed drive, and an MPEG-2 chip for video
playback. All this in a sleek design. It's no surprise that this horsepower
allows stunning broadcast-quality video. At the $10,000 price (including
shipping and handling!), however, it will not be the mainstream multimedia
laptop in 1996. Nonetheless, it was as impressive as Batman's car.

     But there were also numerous notebooks capable of very decent multimedia
performance for $3,500 to $4,500. Among the big guns, Texas Instruments leads
the way in price/performance with its entry-level Extensa 550CD multimedia
notebook. For just under $3,000, it has a 75 MHz Pentium processor, 8
megabytes of RAM, 1 megabyte of video RAM, 10.4-inch dual-scan display (256
colors at 640X480), PCI bus architecture, 16-bit sound card, microphone and
speakers, 524-megabyte hard drive, and double-speed CD-ROM. Many lesser-known
manufacturers (AMS, Sager, Patriot) have this typical entry-level multimedia
configuration at even lower prices. Some notebooks with similar
capabilities--such as the Vectra 4000 from NEC and the Gateway Solo
V75--seemed to be overpriced and are likely to be reduced by early this year.

     I saw many mouth-watering midrange multimedia notebooks (Toshiba
Satellite Pro 410, NEC Versa 4000, Gateway Solo) for about $4,000 to $5,000,
sporting 90- or 100-MHz Pentiums, 8 to 16 megabytes of RAM, 540- to
720-megabyte hard disks, active matrix or dual-scan screens, and
quadruple-speed built-in CD-ROMs. Toshiba announced at the show the price of
the Tecra 700 Series, which will represent the high end of the multimedia
notebook market this year. The Tecra 700CT has a 120-MHz Pentium, 16 megabytes
of RAM, a 1-gigabyte hard drive, 11.3-inch active matrix display capable of
65,000 colors at 800X600 resolution, 16-bit audio, and a quadruple-speed
CD-ROM drive. At a price of $6,000, it certainly will not be an impulse buy.
Gateway announced a similar notebook at the same price, and others will follow
suit.

DESKTOP MULTIMEDIA PROWESS

     On the desktops we shall see 100- to 120-MHz Pentiums, with 16 megabytes
of RAM, 15- to 17-inch monitors (with 65,000 colors at 800X600),
quadruple-speed drives, 1.2-gigabyte hard drives capable of full-screen,
full-motion video (through MPEG-1 chips on the motherboard), and hi-fi audio
quality (through DSP--Digital Signal Processor--chips instead of sound boards)
for about $2,300 to $3,000. IBM sets the tone for the mainstream multimedia
desktop with its Aptiva series. Although its case design is nondescript at
best, what is inside the box is impressive and sufficient for good multimedia
playback. You will not see new models featuring Intel 486 processors and
double-speed drives, as these will become passe this year and will be sold
only at close-outs.

AUDIO HARMONY AND CACOPHONY

     Recorded audio performance cannot be much improved beyond CD-quality, but
the synthetic music renderings certainly will get better, because in almost
all the new audio cards you'll find wave-table synthesis support for MIDI
playback. Audio installation will be much easier because the majority of the
new multimedia systems will come with DSP chips, and users will not need to
know any more about them than they do about math co-processors. While sound
boards will still be sold (for the sake of those who want to upgrade their
existing systems), it will be a much easier task to install the new
plug-and-play sound boards if you are using Windows 95 and let the hardware
wizard take over the "seating" arrangement as a maitre d'.

     Enhanced CDs will probably be a disappointment. I have played with half
a dozen titles, and (as I will detail in my February column) most of them were
unimpressive and overpriced. Some of my reasons, of course, may be subjective.
It is, however, an objective fact that the much-heralded Enhanced CD,
particularly the CD Plus (Blue Book) format, will have a very rocky start. As
if it had not caused enough cacophony and confusion, why are there three
different enhanced CD formats (Track Zero, Track One and CD Plus)? The latter
format will not run on any of the NEC, Toshiba, and Sanyo drives manufactured
before August 1995. This represents at least hundreds of thousands of drives
and a pretty large number of angry customers who will ditch their Sony CD Plus
discs and be utterly skeptical about the Enhanced CD concept (see my sidebar,
"CD Plus Turns Out to Be CD Minus" on page 34).

     What gave me some peace of mind amid this cacophony was listening to the
series of sound clips from Network Music in the most elegant and comfortable
booth of the show. We have heard and seen a lot of CD-ROMs with audio clips,
but this series exudes professionalism and quality. There are five volumes
(business/office, high tech, pop culture, etc.), each with 30 music samples in
30- and 60-second, short-tag and loop versions of perfectly recorded music at
11 and 22 KHz, and 100 sound effects that you may edit (for perfectly timed
fade-in and fade-out) and convert to different sampling rates, frequency, and
even to compressed format to include in your multimedia presentation. There
are certainly cheaper alternatives, but you get what you pay for. Along with
stock film and video footage, this type of mediaware will be significant this
year.

DIGITAL VIDEO DELIGHT

     Delightful digital video will finally arrive  this year in a convenient
and affordable way. The key to that will be MPEG compression/decompression.
MPEG-1 playback chips on the motherboards or on the video accelerator cards
will be widespread and will provide full-screen, full-motion video at least at
videotape quality. MPEG-2 decoder chips (for broadcast-quality video) will be
limited to the high-end market because of the price. However, MPEG-1 movies
(320X240 resolution and 24 frames/second) will be played back also without
hardware decoders. I have heard claims that MPEG clips played with
software-only decoders will produce decent video on 33-MHz Intel 486
processors, but my own experience clearly suggests that a 75-MHz Pentium and
double-speed drive are required as a minimum. As this will be the entry-level
multimedia machine, I believe that many of the multimedia titles will have
MPEG videos by mid-1996.

     CompCore impressed me the most with its MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 hardware
products and particularly with the video quality of the SoftPEG software-only
decompressor. There have already been many contenders for hardware MPEG
solutions, but this fairly young company managed to license its technology to
such industry heavyweights as NEC, Packard Bell, Hitachi, Cirrus Logic, and
ATI. It is akin to starting with a few Grand Slam trophies while still
unseeded.

     Horizon Technology is another promising provider of software-only MPEG
playback technology with its TrueMotion-S. The company also has a multimedia
authoring package (Open! Info Manager) that facilitates the making of
multimedia presentations that include motion video. Sirius' Motion Pixels
technology was yet another impressive demonstration of software-only playback
of highly compressed video files, though not MPEG files. Beyond playback
quality, the crucial issues for developers will be the licensing arrangement
and the performance at the compression stage. We shall see a lot of CD-ROMs on
a lot of Pentium PCs with much better video than in 1995.

     It is too early to predict what will happen this year with the proposed
Zoomed Video Port (ZV Port) standard, which would allow transfer of
full-motion, full-screen video with minimal CPU utilization, through a new PC
Card (the card earlier known as PCMCIA). It sounds amazing but I'll believe it
(and report about it) when I see it.

WHAT MAY NOT FLY IN 1996

     There were a couple of announcements of products that may not be
available in volume in 1996 or that may not have a sizable market. Intel's
Pentium Pro is unlikely to have wide appeal. That's the new name for the
processor that has been mentioned until now as the P6. It is a bad name. Not
because I would prefer "Sextium," but because users will be confused,
especially as both the Pentium and Pentium Pro line will have a 150- and
166-MHz product. It also gives the impression that the Pentium itself is not
for the pros. At that high speed, it certainly is.

     The PowerPC has been depicted for nearly two years as the Promised Land
for those who want to use both Mac and DOS/Windows products on the same
computer, and it was characterized as a perfect cooperation among Apple, IBM,
and Motorola. While Apple has indeed come out with PowerPC-based systems, IBM
had no desktop computer featuring this processor, and you could not run IBM
applications on the Macs equipped with PowerPC chip. At COMDEX there was again
a pavilion dedicated to PowerPC, and it wasn't only birds chirping the new
magic word CHRP (Common Hardware Reference Platform). But I doubt that we
shall see any such desktop computers this year that will run both Mac and IBM
applications without third-party emulation software.

     Of course the big question for multimedia users is whether high density
or super-density ROMs of several gigabytes capacity will steamroll the
680-megabyte CD-ROMs of today. I saw the impressive prototypes; I saw the
joint communique from the formerly warring Sony/Philips and
Toshiba/Time-Warner teams (and their own brochures), but I'd bet my computer
that the super-density drives will not be shipping in 1996.

     In the meantime, we were able to witness at COMDEX how good old CD-ROM
technology keeps improving. As this is an issue not only for multimedia but
also for non-multimedia CD-ROM applications (and because I'm running out of
space), I'll discuss CD-ROM drive developments in this month's CD-ROM
Commentaries column (page 26).

     Las Vegas may have gotten cleaner than it was in the 70s as depicted by
Scorsese in his current movie, "Casino." While it still is unlikely to hit the
Boy Scouts' list of recommended places to visit, it is the perfect place for
COMDEX, and especially for the show's multimedia exhibits. Sometimes I had to
pause and remember whether I was in a casino on the Strip or in the Multimedia
Pavilion. Not a bad dilemma.


[The following sidebar is included in the article.]

                     CD Plus May Turn Out to Be CD Minus

          The CD Plus solution has been heralded for a year as the panacea for
     the problems of playing back music on an audio CD player from CD-ROMs
     that have both computer files and audio CD files--without damaging your
     speakers or your ears with white noise as the audio CD player tries to
     play back a computer file. Users are warned to skip the first track where
     the multimedia file resides, but users don't always pay attention. Many
     just toss in the CD-ROM and press the play button.

          In the CD Plus format, the audio CD file is on the first track,
     followed by a gap and then by the computer file. Sensing the gap, the
     audio CD player stops, but the CD-ROM reader can get to the computer
     file. The September issue of "Computer Life" magazine depicted such a
     wonderful, fairy-tale scenario about CD Plus that I could hardly wait to
     get my hands on a CD Plus-format disc. There were none available, so I
     held my breath and waited for COMDEX.

          It seemed to me to be absurd that while the CD Plus format was
     endorsed not only by the Recording Industry Association of America but by
     Sony and Philips, Sony had none available at that time, and at its booth
     Philips showed upcoming titles in every format except CD Plus. Well, it
     turns out that you will not be able to use titles in CD Plus format if
     you have--among others--a NEC or a Toshiba drive manufactured before
     August 1995. Chances are good that you do, as these drives have been
     best-sellers, sold in the hundreds of thousands not only directly to you
     but to PC manufacturers (as OEM products) who built these drives into
     their computers. And don't forget multimedia kit manufacturers who bundle
     sound boards with CD-ROM players.

          When I finally got my first CD Plus title ("Bob Dylan's Greatest
     Hits," from Sony), I was less than pleased to see that there was no
     warning about the fatal incompatibilities. The outside label  tells you
     that you need a 486SX 25-MHz or faster system, 8 MB of RAM, Windows 3.1
     or higher, 640X480 resolution, 256 colors (8 bit), double-speed or faster
     multisession CD-ROM drive and 8-bit sound card. In other words,
     single-speed, single-session drive owners need not apply. That's all.

          Only when you open the box at home will you find the following
     ominous sentences in the user booklet: " . . . certain CD-ROM drives may
     not properly recognize CD Plus discs. With [the enclosed] Corel drivers
     for Enhanced CD, you may be able to upgrade your CD-ROM drive to make it
     CD Plus compatible." But for many drives, this upgrade does not help.

          Sony's way of dealing with the incompatibility problem was to put no
     outside warning label alerting consumers to it, because users would not
     know whether their machines were affected, since most PCs have OEM
     drives. This is neither a heart-warming attitude nor a convincing
     argument. Hundreds of thousands of users have CD-ROMs that are clearly
     labeled by the NEC or Toshiba logo. Even in the case of OEM drives, users
     could often find out from the CONFIG.SYS file if they have drive that is
     not CD Plus compatible. Sony could have attached on a floppy the Corel
     CD-ROM Advisor program (included inside the package on a separate CD). It
     could have been made available from Sony's Internet site to let potential
     customers check whether their drives were capable of recognizing a CD
     Plus format disc.

          As I was fiddling with the installation, I bumped into a file that,
     although in a proprietary format (presumably to be used by the Corel
     Advisor program), was easily deciphered. Having snooped around in this
     file, let me do what Sony should have done by advising you about the
     brands and models of those multisession and double-speed or faster CD-ROM
     and CD-R drives that are unlikely to appropriately handle CD Plus format
     discs: NEC CDR601; Multispin 4x Pro, CDR510, and Multispin 74-1; TEAC
     CD-50; Plextor DM-XX24K; Aiwa ACD-300; Hitachi CDR-6750 and CDR 37-50;
     Reno CD-ROMX2A; Yamaha CDR100; and Ricoh RO1060C. These latter two are
     recorders/players. The Toshiba XM3501 and XM-3601 are likely to skip on
     audio, rendering them useless.

          The fatal incompatibility problem and Sony's attitude are likely to
     spoil the (post-) Christmas spirit and will dampen the enthusiasm of the
     public not only for the CD Plus format but for the entire enhanced CD
     concept. Not long ago, MediaVision went bankrupt over its sound card's
     incompatibility problems and its attitude toward handling of returns.
     Disney burnt its fingers with the bug-ridden CD-ROM release of "The Lion
     King" a year ago. Intel was grilled for shipping processor chips that
     calculated incorrectly in some situations and paid dearly for not
     advising customers sincerely.

          Sony will lose some of its credibility, and cooling down disgruntled
     customers and CD Plus distributors will cost Sony more than spelling out
     specifically the limitations of the CD Plus titles would have done.

INTERNET WAVES: THE INDESTRUCTIBLE, INDISPENSABLE INTERNET

     By Shirley Duglin Kennedy

     The Internet, a technological child of the Cold War era, was originally
designed as a Department of Defense communication network that could withstand
a nuclear attack. Specifically, if a portion of the network was decimated by
The Bomb, data packets could be rerouted, so communication would not be
totally disrupted. This explains why an ailing computer or router in Atlanta,
for instance, does not bring the entire Net to its knees--although data
"traffic" to that part of the world may be somewhat slower.

     This efficient design and function are aspects that make the Internet so
valuable in today's global economy. As information professionals, most of us
have eagerly embraced the Internet as a multifaceted tool, using it for
information retrieval, networking, and communications. Scientists and
researchers, of course, were using the Net long before most of us realized
that it even existed. These days, a staggering range of folks are using the
Net to ply their trade or practice their profession.

SOMEBODY'S BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOUR SAFETY AND SURVIVAL

     The reliability of the Internet's distributed structure makes it ideal
for disaster planning and emergency management. The Natural Hazards Research
and Applications Information Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder
has done a great deal of work in this area, and you can see the results on its
home page, at http://adder.colorado.edu/~hazctr/Home.html. Among the things
you'll find here is the full text of all session summaries from the Hazards
Research and Applications Workshop held in Boulder last summer. Many of the
sites listed below were mentioned in the Hazards Center's bimonthly
publication, "Natural Hazards Observer." Subscriptions are free to subscribers
within the U.S.--as are subscriptions to the online publication, "Disaster
Research." Send e-mail to hazctr@spot.colorado.edu for information.

     As you might expect, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA)
home page, at http://www.fema.gov/fema/index.html, is one of the best
clearinghouses for emergency management information on the Internet. One of
FEMA's most popular publications, "The Emergency Guide for Business and
Industry," can be found at http://www.fema.gov/fema/bizindex.html.

     The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has a Web site
(http://www.icrc.ch) that provides a wide range of information on civil
conflict, disasters, disaster victims, and the ICRC's role in dealing with
these problems. You'll find press releases, fact sheets, in-depth articles,
illustrated brochures, position papers, texts of various treaties and other
publications, as well as links to other Red Cross/Red Crescent organization
Web sites.

     The Natural Disaster Reference Database home page
(http://ltpwww.gsfc.nasa.gov/ndrd-cgi/ndrd), constructed by the Earth Sciences
Directorate of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, contains bibliographic
information on research results and programs related to the use of satellite
remote sensing for disaster mitigation.

     The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's National Drought Mitigation Center
offers an electronic clearinghouse of the latest scientific and technical
information on drought at http://enso.unl.edu/ndmc.

     A free, 70-page publication entitled "Emergency Preparedness Guidelines
for Mass, Crowd-Intensive Events," is available from Emergency Preparedness
Canada (EPC). Request this via e-mail to cominfo@jackson.epc.epc-pcc.x400.gc.
ca. Check out other publications available from EPC at http://hoshi.cic.sfu.
ca/~epc/.

     The National Institute for Urban Search and Rescue home page
(http://niusr.org/~usar) provides copies of its newsletter, a compendium of
seismic information sites on the Net, and earthquake preparedness information
for child safety.

     The Los Angeles bureau of "The Economist" magazine has set up a site that
includes text and images from an article entitled "Fear of Trembling," which
appeared in the April 22, 1995 issue. In addition to a large amount of
information on earthquakes and earthquake engineering, you'll also find an
exhaustive list of pointers to related Internet resources
(http://www.earthlink.net/~the-econmist).

     Additional earthquake-related sites include:

     --   The National Center for Earthquake Engineering
          (http://nceer.eng.buffalo.edu)

     --   The Southern California Earthquake Center
          (http://www.usc.edu/dept/earth/quake/index.html)

     --   Stanford University's John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering Center

SELECTED STATISTICS

     Here are some interesting tidbits from "The Internet Index" by Win Treese
(11/11/95 edition):

     --   Percentage of public libraries (serving populations of 100,000 or
          more) offering Internet access: 25. Percentage providing assistance
          for Internet users: 5.

     --   Number of Internet mailing lists known to the Indiana University
          Support Center: 12,850.

     --   Number of airlines with Web sites: 42.

     --   Number of Internet service providers (worldwide): more than 1,400.

     --   Best estimate of the number of Internet users (7/95): 20-30 million.

STRICTLY BUSINESS

     Stop! Don't trash that fax machine! A recent survey of Fortune 500
companies by Gallup/Pitney Bowes found that firms with e-mail capabilities
send just as many faxes as firms without e-mail. Also, the poll found that
faxes were preferred over e-mail, voice mail, or overnight delivery service
for a quick answer.

     As for smaller businesses, only 21 percent of their owners with awareness
of the Internet were actually using it, according to a Gallup/MCI survey.
Thirty-five percent said it was too expensive; 35 percent said the technology
was too complex, and 46 percent admitted they were "cyberphobic."

     Business misuse of the Internet is another issue entirely. Recently,
Virgin Atlantic Airways (U.K.) was fined $14,000 by the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) for placing a "misleading" fare ad on the Internet.
According to the "Atlanta Journal-Constitution" (11/22/95), this was the first
time DOT had fined an airline for information posted on the Net.

     "The Internetwork Mail Guide," which details methods of sending
electronic mail from one network to another, has long been one of the most
useful documents on the Internet. Provided by Scott Yanoff, the recently
updated version is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.csd.uwm.
edu/pub/internetwork-mail-guide. A Web-based version is available at
http://alpha.acast.nova.edu/cgi-bin/inmgq.pl.

GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

     Although geared to reporters, the Web site of the news office at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government
(http://ksgwww.harvard.edu/~ksgpress/ksgnews.htm) offers "one-stop shopping"
for anyone interested in national or international politics. Here you can find
faculty sources, events, research, and publications. The site also links to
the Online Political Information Network, a well-organized set of links to
most major sources of government and political information on the Internet.

     A site worth checking for election information is U.S. News Online
(http://www.usnews.com), which includes a special Election '96 section
featuring stories, photos, background information, and links to candidates'
Web sites. You can also read the weekly news magazine here, and access daily
news updates, photo essays, sound bites, and a variety of special features.

     A good set of links to Department of Defense and NATO sites can be found
at: http://ukanaix.cc.ukans.edu/history/ehawk/arm_index.html.

     The U.S. National Archives Center for Electronic Records has made
available its "Title List: A Preliminary and Partial Listing of the Datafiles
in the National Archives and Records Administration," at http://gopher.nara.
gov:70/1/inform/cd/electr/titlelst. Included are entries for more than 9,000
of the approximately 23,000 electronic records files held by the National
Archives. Titles are listed by government branch and, within branch, by record
group. The list is available as one huge file (1.3M), or as 19 separate files.
(Note: You must read the "Introduction" and "Status Codes/Comment Codes" in
order to understand the files.)

     Government contractors or wanna-bes should definitely check out
http://www.govcon.com, which features, among other things, "Commerce Business
Daily," teaming opportunities, mergers and acquisitions, employment
opportunities, and full text of such documents as the Federal Acquisitions
Regulation (FAR) and Cost Accounting Standards. There is also a directory of
8(a) certified government contracting firms, and an "interactive yellow
pages," which helps locate experts in various fields to provide assistance in
federal government contracting.

ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING DILEMMA

     According to an article in the 11/17/95 issue of the "Chronicle of Higher
Education," researchers whose work is published online before it comes out in
print are trimming valuable weeks off the one-year limitation they have if
they wish to file a patent on their findings. Some journals are in the
practice of running abstracts--or entire articles--online weeks before the
hard copy becomes available. And papers are often posted on a Web site prior
to a conference where their findings will be announced. While the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office  hasn't issued an official ruling on "electronic
disclosure," a spokesman indicated that patent lawyers should assume that
anything available online should be considered "published."

CREDIT CARD SECURITY RISK UPDATE

     Is the widespread fear of sending a credit card number over the Internet
justified? Not when you consider the alternatives, concluded Peter H. Lewis,
a "New York Times" reporter who addressed the subject in an article last
November. "Sending a credit card number over the Internet to an electronic
merchant is probably the safest way to make such a transaction," Lewis wrote.
"In the last week, for example, I handed my credit card to a waiter who
disappeared with it for five minutes. I faxed my credit card information to a
business in New Jersey, and the fax probably lay exposed to everyone in that
office for hours and perhaps to the cleaning crew that night. I called a hotel
and gave my credit card data to a reservation clerk and continued my
recklessness by ordering some merchandise from a clothing catalog, again by
reading my credit card information to some unseen operator. . . . Compared
with the risk of handing my credit card to a stranger, which I do nearly every
day, sending it over the Internet is pretty secure."

INTERNET INSIGHTS: SEARCHING OUT AND ASSESSING WEB SITES

     By Paul Blake

     [Editor's Note: This marks the first round of Paul Blake's new bimonthly
column, Internet Insights. As a London-based writer/editor for Learned
Information  Europe Ltd., Paul has written IT's European Report column for
some time. Recently he changed his focus at Learned to concentrate more on the
Internet. In his new column, he will discuss the dynamic happenings on the Net
in the context of the information industry and give publishers, information
professionals, and information users insights into how they can exploit this
new medium.]

     There have been a welter of recent developments aimed at making searching
the Internet easier and more precise. While it is probably overly optimistic
to claim that the difficulties of finding information on the Net have
disappeared, the latest enhancements to search engines, such as Yahoo!, Lycos,
and Open Text, amount to a significant step in the right direction.

     One of the most impressive new entrants comes from IBM, which has teamed
up with Ontario-based Open Text Corp. to launch a World Wide Web-based search
service that retrieves data both from Web pages and from information providers
such as Disclosure, Information Access Company, and Cambridge Scientific
Abstracts.

INFOMARKET SEARCH

     Called the infoMarket Search service, it lets users search multiple
databases simultaneously across the Net. Users are able to search sources
through a single interface, with infoMarket Search able to access text and
multimedia data and then merge results together. The service was free of
charge to users at the time this column was written, though charges will be
announced early in 1996.

     According to Open Text, its retrieval engine is unique in being able to
search millions of Web pages in under five seconds and for its understanding
of the structure of documents found on the WWW. Open Text's technology uses
automated "crawlers" to index the complete text of Web documents. These index
every word on every page, as well as recording the structural context of each
indexed string. They constantly search for new documents to index and revisit
sites frequently to add to the master index.

     At launch, the sources accessible via infoMarket Search are Yahoo!, the
Open Text Index of Web documents, the content of 13,000 Usenet newsgroups, and
the McKinley listing of rated sites on the Internet. In the latter case,
Internet resources have been reviewed and evaluated by research specialists
and McKinley's editorial advisory boards for content, currency, organization
of the resource, ease of use, and accessibility. According to IBM,
negotiations are under way with a variety of other content providers, ranging
from "news services to digital libraries and image databases."

     IBM says that publishers with content distributed among different
platforms or locations will be able to use infoMarket Search to create
tailored "virtual services" for their customers. Users will also be able to
install infoMarket agents to enable them to search internal and external
sources through one interface. "The aim of the infoMarket service is to enable
end users to enter a single query that is capable of interrogating nearly all
of the common database formats, supports numerous search engines, and delivers
content to  the predominant end-user platforms," explained Jeff Crigler, vice
president of IBM infoMarket. "The service can also be modified to meet users'
particular requirements or systems."

YAHOO! AND OPEN TEXT

     Open Text is also involved in a move to add a search capability to
Yahoo!, one of the Web's most comprehensive subject guides. Yahoo!, which
catalogs Web pages according to subject headings, now also offers the ability
to search its entries using the Open Text retrieval engine.

     Using Open Text, Yahoo! users will be able to conduct searches for
specific words and phrases, multilevel Boolean searches, as well as weighted
searches. Inquiries can be narrowed to specific categories in Yahoo!'s
hierarchical index, and users will also be able to use structural operators
such as document title, sub-headings, body copy, and footnotes as qualifiers
for their searches. Additionally, Open Text will offer the ability to retrieve
documents "similar" to those a user has already found.

     "The Open Text technology expands Yahoo! with a 'back of the book'
word-by-word index of the Internet, which complements our 'front of the book'
hierarchical index," said Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo!. "This will boost
the efficiency and productivity of both browsing and more serious searching on
Yahoo!, and broaden its appeal to a wider range of Internet users."

LYCOS SPIDER

     One of Yahoo!'s rivals, the Lycos Spider, has not been sitting still
either. It has a fresh interface, along with support for HotJava and
"backlinks"--which let users who have clicked to Lycos from another site
return directly to the original site by clicking on an icon on the Lycos
search screen. A new search form lets users set display options, such as to
one-line summaries, or for hits that are "loosely matched" or "very strongly
matched."

     Lycos has also added reviews of the top 5 percent World Wide Web
sites--graded for content, presentation, and the "experience" of accessing
them. As part of a $3 million acquisition of Point Communications Corp., the
Lycos search engine has integrated Point's review and rating guide to the Web.
After carrying out a search of the Web, the user will be able to view the
search results from the Lycos catalog, together with ratings of sites
retrieved.

     A team of about 30 Point reviewers employs a 50-point scale to rate Web
sites for content, as well as for presentation and the experience of using the
site, defined as whether the site is worth the time, and whether the user
would recommend it to others. Web sites landing in the top 5 percent are
awarded Badges of Excellence. Current holders include the Global Health
Network, Mobil Oil, and Lucas Arts.

     The Lycos Web site has also integrated Point Communications' Point Now
service, which provides brief items of business news, stocks, and weather,
with hotlinks to CNN and other news sources. Lycos itself was launched last
June as a commercial avenue for the Spider search technology first developed
at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Eight million sites, or 91 percent of the
Web, are indexed by the service.

WEBCOMPASS

     Established software vendors are also getting in on the Web searching
act. Quarterdeck has unveiled software that allows users to send a single
query to multiple Web search engines, then receive a summary of results
including subtopics. Using WebCompass, searchers can also automatically update
results, store them locally on the PC, and assign rankings to them.

     When a user enters a query or topic of interest, WebCompass polls
multiple search engines, such as Lycos and InfoSeek, for relevant Web pages.
The content of these pages is summarized and presented to the user. When there
are a large number of results, WebCompass automatically groups the summarized
pages into subtopics, giving the user the option to drill down on specific
topics.

     WebCompass also lets users build a personalized index of topics that they
are interested in and store retrieved data in a database based in the
Microsoft Access 2.0 file format. The software can be set to perform regularly
scheduled queries on selected Web sites to update existing information in the
database. The user can additionally assign a rating system, from one to five,
for the importance of topics and subtopics, which the WebCompass search engine
will use in the future to sort data during updates.

     "The idea behind WebCompass is to let the user multiply the power of the
many Web search engines available by performing one search from his or her PC.
We hope it will greatly reduce the time people must spend searching and
analyzing the data available on all of the search engines on the Internet,"
said Emerick Woods, vice president and general manager of the Internet
business unit at Quarterdeck.

     WebCompass, Personal Edition, which will cost under $100, works with any
Web browser and runs on a 486-based PC with a minimum of 8 megabytes of
memory, with 16 megabytes recommended.

BOOK REVIEW: THE COMPLETE INTERNET COMPANION FOR LIBRARIANS


     by Allen C. Benson
     Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc., 1995
     ISBN: 1-55570-178-7 (softcover)
     407 pages, $49.95

     Reviewed by Virginia Gatcheff Gehrig

     If a library can only buy one book to learn about the Internet, "The
Complete Internet Companion for Librarians" is the book to buy. This
comprehensive book covers all aspects of the Internet, from hardware
requirements to training staff members. Benson's text is easy to read and is
geared for those new to the online world. Yet, experienced Internet surfers
will not be bored. His specific audience is "librarians who are responsible
for planning and setting up their organization's computer system." Those
involved in online reference services or anyone who exchanges information over
the Internet will also benefit from this book.

     "The Complete Internet Companion for Librarians" is divided into six
parts. Part One, "Overview of the Internet," describes the Internet for
newcomers and explains what hardware and software is required to gain access
to the "information superhighway." A list of national Internet service
providers is included.

     Part Two, "Tools and Protocols," describes in detail how to use the three
main communications services of the Internet: ftp (file transfer protocol),
telnet, and e-mail. Part Three, "Search Utilities and the Client/Server
Model," focuses on resource discovery tools such as Archie, WAIS (Wide Area
Information Servers), World Wide Web browsers, and gophers.

     Part Four, "General Resources," gives a broad overview of the types of
information services available on the Internet such as listserv discussion
lists, Campus-Wide Information Systems, and Usenet newsgroups. Part Five,
"Integrating the Internet into Traditional Library Services," focuses
exclusively on how a library can use the Internet effectively. This section is
explained in more detail below. Part Six, "Internet Resources Arranged by
Subject A-Z," is a selective list of Internet services and resources.

     Chapter 21, "The Librarian's Role in Implementing Internet," gives
practical advice for the librarians assigned to the task of establishing the
Internet in the library's environment. A significant portion of the chapter is
devoted to training, and examples in the books can be used during training
sessions. The chapter also gives ample training outlines and suggested
content. Benson also discusses the issues of copyright and digital information
and how portions of copyright law apply to libraries and computer systems. The
chapter includes a recommended Internet use policy and tips on how to use
public relations to garner community support of the Internet in the library.
Sample community demonstrations are included for adult services, youth
services, high school, and college students. Most helpful may be the section
on how to integrate the Internet into existing services and how to add value
to Internet services. The chapter closes with some profiles on how librarians
are becoming involved in online publishing with such efforts as local history
archives and locating and repackaging information.

     Chapter 22, "Implementing Internet Service In-House," takes the Internet
beyond the reference room and provides ideas for using the Internet throughout
the library. This chapter shows how the Internet can be used in technical
services, acquisitions, and collection development.

     Chapter 23, "Reference Services," returns to the reference room and
details how to effectively use the Internet in answering the three most common
types of reference questions: author/title questions, fact-finding questions,
and subject questions. Benson discusses the problems associated with locating
and accessing information, primarily the Internet's tremendous size and vast
resources. He offers some time- and trouble-saving tips for searching
efficiently and introduces the reader to Infopop. (Infopop is a Windows-based
application that allows users to create their own indexes on Internet
resources.)

     Examples are used extensively throughout the entire book. In several
places, exercises are included to encourage the reader to become familiar with
the Internet and how it works. "The Complete Internet Companion for
Librarians" also includes a list of library-related discussion lists and tells
how to subscribe to them. Benson's book is a valuable resource for librarians
implementing the Internet. Its specific focus on the library's use of the
Internet makes it preferable to other general reference books.

FASTER AUTHORING SYSTEMS AND DISC DRIVES

     Like many other things in our technologically advancing society, CD-ROM
capabilities are constantly "new and improved." Here are two examples: a
high-speed authoring system and a faster CD-ROM drive.

DATA/WARE'S HIGH-SPEED CD-AUTHORING SYSTEM

     Data/Ware Development has released its Server Enterprise Authoring System
(S/EAS), a high-speed CD-authoring system. S/EAS is the latest addition to
Data/Ware Development's line of optical storage and CD-authoring systems. Like
the Enterprise Authoring System (EAS) from which it is derived, S/EAS includes
all of the hardware and software required to author CDs in an automated,
lights-out environment.

     According to Dale Smith, vice president of new product development for
Data/Ware, large organizations in fields ranging from banking and insurance to
telecommunications and government are turning to data distribution by CD as a
cost-effective alternative to COM or paper. "In addition to reducing the
expenses associated with producing, distributing, and storing COM and paper
documents," said Smith, "CDs make it fast and easy to access data. The result
is improved productivity and customer service."

     S/EAS requires no mainframe processing to produce CDs. Instead, a
UNIX-based SPARCserver handles all pre-processing and processing steps.

     S/EAS accepts data or images from 3480/3490 tape cartridges, a LAN/WAN,
or a mainframe. After data or images are downloaded to S/EAS, custom software
prepares it for recording to CDs and also extracts indexes from reports as
required. After the pre-processing phase is finished, S/EAS masters the data
to make it conform to the ISO 9660 standard for recording and reading data on
CDs. S/EAS can operate multiple 2x or 6x CD writers simultaneously and can be
equipped with robotic feeders. Each feeder can hold 75 CDs, enough to last an
entire production shift.

     To view data, end users simply insert a S/EAS CD into a standard CD-ROM
drive in any PCrunning Windows.In addition to rapid data access, users can cut
and paste data to other PC applications such as word processors, databases,
and spreadsheets. They can also print and fax on demand.

     For more information, contact Data/Ware Development, Inc., San Diego, CA,

TOSHIBA'S 6.7 SPEED CD-ROM DRIVE

     Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., Disk Products Division (TAIS
DPD) has announced the XM-3701 Series of 6.7-speed CD-ROM drives that support
a 1,000 KB/sec. data transfer rate.

     "Toshiba's new XM-3701 Series drives meet the needs of OEMs, VAD/VARs,
and distributors who need to provide cutting-edge performance and high-quality
drives to their customers today," said Jerry Higgins, vice president of
product marketing, CD-ROM, TAIS DPD. "These new drives with their 1,000
KB/sec. sustained data transfer rate and 120 ms random seek time provide
CD-ROM users with the performance necessary to support smooth full-motion
video and complex high-end graphics transfers from CD-ROMs."

     The new XM-3701 Series' fast rotational speed of 6.7x was achieved
through enhanced error correction, employment of a digital signal processor,
and an improved optical pick-up head and spindle motor. In addition to the
6.7x rotational speed, the drives also support rotations of 1x and 2x.

     The XM-3701 CD-ROM drives employ the variable speed playback system used
in previous Toshiba CD-ROM drives. The variable-speed playback system allows
the drive to read data before the disk reaches a specific rotational speed of
1, 2, or 6.7 times standard rotational speeds. As a result, the CD-ROM drive
provides improved drive read times. The variable-speed playback also decreases
power consumption to 5.9 watts average.

     The low-mass optical pick-up and digital servo control featured in the
XM-3701 drives ensure fast access to complex data, video, and audio files
located anywhere on the disc. The digital servo control provides greater
tracking precision and head position, ultimately giving the drives their 120
ms random seek time.

     The XM-3701 Series drives comply with MPC-3 and-2 specifications and are
compatible with Kodak multi-session Photo-CD and CD-Plus, red book, yellow
book, and CD-ROM XA. The drives are also CD-Bridge, CD-i, and CD-i Ready
compatible and can be used as a CD-Audio player, independent of the computer
system.

     The XM-3701 Series drives feature a sealed enclosure that maintains a
contamination-free environment for data integrity. The result is a high MTBF
of 100,000 hours. The SCSI-2 interface XM-3701 Series drives support CD-DA
transfers over the SCSI bus for maximum bandwidth utilization and feature a
256 KB data buffer.

     The drives may be mounted horizontally or vertically for user
flexibility. The tray-type electrical disc loader eliminates the need for a
caddy, and the drives feature a media removal prevention function. The XM-3701
Series drives are available in internal and external models. The XM-3701B
internal drive has a suggested list price of $415, and the TXM-3701D external
drive has a suggested list price of $515.

     The TAIS Disk Products Division markets a wide range of industry-standard
Winchester and CD-ROM disk drives. For additional product information, contact
Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., Disk Products Division, Irvine, CA,
714/457-0777.

BUSINESS&INDUSTRY DATABASE NOW ON CD-ROM

     Responsive Database Services, Inc. (RDS) has announced that its
innovative Business&Industry (B&I) online database is now available on CD-ROM.

     Designed to meet the needs of professional, novice, and occasional
researchers, "B&I on CD-ROM" enables easy and precise retrieval of facts,
figures, key events, rankings, industry overviews, and trends dealing with
companies, industries, markets, and products throughout the world.

     "B&I on CD-ROM" delivers full-text articles, informative abstracts, and
thousands of numerical tables from over 600 leading trade magazines,
newsletters, business publications, regional newspapers, and international
business dailies from 30 countries.

     According to RDS, since "B&I" offers both professional search software
and Easy Menu Search software (for DOS and Macintosh platforms), users of all
experience levels will find it useful. In public and academic libraries, "B&I"
can be a powerful research tool for students and faculty as well as for
salespeople, personal investors, job seekers, and non-profit development
offices gathering information on companies or industries. In corporate use,
"B&I on CD-ROM" can serve as a cost-effective supplement to online searches
and also enable employees to retrieve information when library staff is
unavailable.

     "`B&I on CD-ROM' embodies many of the features, improvements, and
benefits that users of business information files are asking for," said Dick
Harris, president of RDS. "In today's searching environment, time,
cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and good results are especially important."

     All records included in "B&I"--which is available online as DIALOG File
9 and DataStar BIDB--are indexed at a detailed level to assure precise
retrieval. Each record has an enhanced title that describes the article's
content. Original articles published in languages other than English include
an enhanced title and an informative abstract in English.

     "B&I's" indexing terms and search codes are based on common-use business
terminology. With its "controlled vocabulary" terms, searchers use
natural-language words and phrases such as market size, market share, industry
forecasts, company overview, market testing, product introduction, mergers and
acquisitions, joint venture, trends, demographics, African-American market,
Generation X market, green market, cooperative campaigns, cobranding, umbrella
marketing, and more.

     "B&I" enables users to search arrays of product codes by utilizing
industry names, thus eliminating the need to select or input product codes. In
addition with DIALOGLink, "B&I on CD-ROM" will automatically extend searches
by dialing out and logging on to "B&I's" online service.

     The "B&I CD-ROM" includes approximately 300,000 records--the full
database as it appears online for the most recent 15 months. The annual
subscription price is $3,995, and the public and academic library subscription
price is $2,400.

THREE NEW DISCS FROM GALE

     Gale Research has recently announced these three new products:

EASY ACCESS TO SEC FILINGS

     Financial consultants, brokers, and market researchers can get fast
access to SEC reports for nearly 900 of the top 1,000 companies with "Gale's
SEC Connection," a new CD-ROM business resource.

     Individual entries can be accessed via a menu of six search criteria:
company name, industry, SIC code, city, state, and/or ZIP code of the
company's headquarters. One or more criteria can be selected for broad or
narrow searches that will lead the user to the report(s) sought.

     Each report may include (but is not limited to) information on marketing
strategy, financial information, legal proceedings involving the company,
properties held, insurance, income taxes, executive officers and directors,
subsidiaries, and products the company manufactures or sells.

     Users can access information by company name, industry, SIC code, city,
state, or ZIP code; can "jump" to major portions of the report; and can print
information or download to disc. Search function operators allow users to
combine items for customized searches.

     Minimum system requirements for the single-user version are: IBM or
compatible PC with 80286 processor (80386 or faster processor recommended),
MS-DOS or PC-DOS version 3.3 or higher and MS-DOS CD-ROM extensions (MSCDEX)
version 2.1 or higher, 640K bytes of RAM memory (500 K available), a hard disk
with 5 MB of free space (minimum), 16 MB for optimal speed of software, VGA
graphics card and monitor (color recommended), and an ISO 9660-compatible
CD-ROM drive with cables and interface card.

CD SPEEDS GRANT RESEARCH

     Key information on 167,000 grants from 5,227 funders is available
electronically with "Grants on Disc," new from the Taft Group, an imprint of
Gale Research.

     The annual subscription CD-ROM includes quarterly updates with
information on more than 30,000 recently awarded cash grants, or 120,000 new
grants each year.

     Powerful search functions offer quick access (via menu, hotkey, or mouse)
to detailed information on recent grant recipients, including name and
location, dollar amount of recent grants, recipient type, and grantor's
contact information, all of which can be viewed simultaneously in different
windows.

     Items within grant listings are fielded to allow searches using free text
or a combination of terms including grant amount, recipient location (city or
state), recipient ZIP code, recipient type (nine major codes plus 215
subcategories), funder location (city or state), funder ZIP code, and funder
area code.

     System requirements for "Grants on Disc" are IBM compatible 80386SX PC or
higher (486 recommended), DOS 3.3 or higher, Windows 3.1 or higher, a hard
drive with minimum of 2 MB available, 4 MB of RAM (8 MB recommended), VGA
monitor, a mouse or pointing device, and an ISO 9660 CD-ROM player.

     "Grants on Disc" is available from The Taft Group by calling
800/877-TAFT.

CAREER SEARCH GUIDANCE

     A recent Gallup poll reported that 72 percent of employed adults, if they
could plan their lives again, would try to get more information about job or
career options. Nearly one in five said they obtained their current job
through a series of random circumstances. But now people can get help with
"Gale's Career Guidance System," a new CD-ROM resource.

     Said Gale Research careers editor Linda Thurn, "You can save hours of
research time by keying in one occupation name and searching on it for
information on all aspects, rather than looking for salary data in one print
source, job descriptions in another, potential employers in another, and so
on."

     "Gale's Career Guidance System" combines profiles of more than 1,200
careers and 210,000 potential employers with background information from the
U.S. Department of Labor, allowing job hunters to identify the right career,
assess its economic outlook, then find the contact people at the companies
most likely to hire them.

     The "System's" Expanded Edition provides additional guidance by including
self-assessment tools that match personalities to appropriate careers, then
direct the user to needed training or educational programs and available
financial aid.

     The user can thoroughly explore more than 210,000 U.S. companies in the
potential employers section and can identify target employers in a number of
ways, including geographically, by SIC code, by industry group, or by the type
of occupations they employ.

     The U.S. Department of Labor's two popular publications, "Occupational
Outlook Handbook" and "Dictionary of Occupational Titles," are also included.

     Designed for use in career, employment, and outplacement agencies,
"Gale's Career Guidance System" uses either an MS-DOS or PC-DOS platform (3.3
or higher) on an IBM or IBM-compatible personal computer (80286 processor
required, 80486 or faster is recommended). System requirements include 640K
bytes of RAM (520K free), a hard disk with 6 MB minimum of free space (16 for
optimal speed) and a VGA color card and monitor.

     For more information, contact Gale Research, Detroit, 800/877-GALE.

WINDOWS 95 CAN WAIT

     Of the 16,752 total worldwide CD-ROM titles in print at the end of 1995,
only 1.2 percent will be Windows 95 native, according to a survey by the
Woodstock, Vermont-based market research firm InfoTech, Inc. Windows 95 native
CD-ROMs will total 204 worldwide for 1995, and 55 percent of these offer new
content.

     Consumer CD-ROM publishers are embracing the new OS more eagerly than
inhouse or institutional publishers, the survey shows.

     InfoTech forecasts that around 6 percent of total worldwide CD-ROM titles
in print will be Windows 95 native by year-end 1996. By contrast, InfoTech
projects that the Windows 95/NT 32-bit family will take over as the dominant
CD-ROM publishing platform in 1999.

TOP WEB SITES TO ADD INTERACTIVE MULTIMEDIA

     AND YOU CAN VIEW IT THROUGH "SHOCKWAVE"

     Millions of Netscape Navigator 2.0 users can now experience multimedia in
a Web page and the dynamic impact of multimedia documents for the first time.
"Shockwave for Director" brings "Director" productions--with interactive
graphics, sound, and animation--to the Internet. Web developers are using
"Shockwave" now for interactive entertainment, merchandising, advertising,
product demonstrations, and education.

     Macromedia, Inc. has announced that dozens of major Web sites are using
its "Shockwave for Director" to transform the World Wide Web from static pages
to interactive multimedia. Many of the most popular sites on the Internet are
adding high-impact multimedia productions, which can be viewed using Netscape
Navigator 2.0 with a free "Shockwave" plug-in. Now available for the first
time, the "Shockwave" plug-in can be downloaded from Macromedia's Web site
(http://www.macromedia.com).

     Web publishers who are preparing to unveil new media content include a
who's who of the Internet and multimedia worlds: CNN Online, Time Pathfinder,
CondeNet Online, 20th Century Fox, MTV Online, Turner Online, Apple Computer,
Disney's "Toy Story," Intel, USA Today Info, "Advertising Age,"  M/B
Interactive, Sony Music Entertainment, "Melrose Place," Internet Shopping
Network, American Cancer Society, @Home, On Ramp, c/net online, Clement Mok
Designs, Radical Media, Siegel & Gale, ad-hoc Interactive, and Maytag.
Cybernauts can visit Macromedia's Web site to be introduced to the multimedia
Web and for links to the first "shocked" sites showing interactive multimedia.

     "`Shockwave' is a breakthrough that brings the Internet to life," claims
Fred Sotherland, vice president, creative director of c/net: the computer
network. "Now more like television than a print medium, the Web is fun,
dynamic, and interactive. At last, the Internet has what it takes to dazzle
consumers and keep them coming back."

     "Netscape's goal is to make the Internet as open and dynamic an
environment as possible," said Marc Andreessen, founder and vice president of
technology for Netscape communications. "By working with Macromedia's
"Shockwave for Director,"  we are greatly expanding the capabilities for
communicating over the Internet by providing users with richer media and more
compelling means of expression."

     "Shockwave for Director" is targeted at graphic artists, animators, and
other creative nonprogrammers who can immediately use their multimedia skills
to create Web pages with interactive media content. Internet users will be
able to easily download compressed "Director" multimedia movies as quickly as
the typical digitized image. Since "Director" is seamlessly integrated into
the browser (and other tools), "Director" movies run immediately, at full
speed, on the user's desktop.

     To achieve these performance gains during downloads, "Shockwave for
Director" includes a post-processor called Afterburner, which compresses
"Director" files by about 60 percent and optimizes the content by media type.
"Shockwave" files are often smaller than the original static graphics on Web
sites. Support for streaming, which boosts download performance still more,
will be added to future versions of "Shockwave for Director."

     For more information on Macromedia products, call 800/326-2128,
415/252-2000, or fax 415/626-0554. You can also reach Macromedia online:

MULTIMEDIA STARTER KIT FOR THE INTERNET

     Quarterdeck Corporation and Paradesa Media have announced "Larry Magid's
Essential Internet," the first multimedia Internet product available for the
World Wide Web. Aiming for true mass market distribution with over one hour of
rich multimedia content, the title is expected to have a retail price of under
$20. "Larry Magid's Essential Internet" is targeted toward the large number of
new Internet users purchasing multimedia PCs.

     "The multimedia aspects of this product make it unique among a sea of
Internet starter kits that rely on books to explain and guide you through the
Internet. This not only teaches you about the Web, it takes you there," said
Michael Lerner, Paradesa Media executive director.

     The CD-ROM was designed to guide beginning users through the intricacies
of the World Wide Web. Larry Magid, syndicated columnist, best-selling author,
and experienced Net surfer, explains in basic English how the Internet works
and how to navigate through its main services. Using sound, video, and
animation, Magid combines his wealth of knowledge on personal computing and
the Internet with his ability to explain technology in the simplest of terms,
providing users with a true hands-on Internet tutorial.

     "If the World Wide Web was created to make the Internet easier to
navigate, "Larry Magid's Essential Internet" is the answer to untangling what
has become a very crowded and often intimidating World Wide Web," said Emerick
Woods, Quarterdeck vice president and general manager of the Internet business
unit. "This is the first and only multimedia starter kit that not only helps
a user understand and figure out what the Web is all about by literally
walking through it and explaining it in simple terms but also will immediately
connect the user to the Web to find out for themselves."

     Magid explores some of his favorite Web sites right on the CD-ROM. If the
user is interested in learning more, he or she can simply click on a hypertext
link to connect to the Web page being discussed. "Essential Internet" is
developed in HTML to emulate a World Wide Web page. Users surf cyberspace and
learn how to link with millions of computers quickly to locate information
without the cost of being online. And when they're ready, they can investigate
how much it costs to sign up for the service and can instantly get online
using Quarterdeck's Connect & Play feature.

     "Larry Magid's Essential Internet" is available at major computer retail
stores nationwide. Updates to the CD-ROM can be downloaded for free by
accessing the Larry's World Web site (http://www.larrysworld.com). The package
comes bundled with Quarterdeck Mosaic, Message Center for news and e-mail,
Connect and Play, and up to 30 days of free Internet access from NETCOM
On-Line Communications, Inc.

     For more information, contact Quarterdeck, Marina del Rey, CA,

SOFTWARE FOR CONSUMER SATISFACTION

     The Interactive Multimedia Assoc-iation (IMA), a worldwide trade
organization representing more than 380 interactive multimedia technology
providers, has officially launched an industry-wide campaign to help consumers
better match CD-ROM software titles to their personal computing systems. The
IMA's CD MATCH program is designed to improve consumer satisfaction and reduce
retail returns of multimedia titles, which are running as high as 30 percent
for some titles.

     Endorsed by a number of leading CD-ROM title publishers and retailers,
the CD MATCH campaign will provide millions of consumers with free software
that automatically runs a check of their multimedia PCs and provides a
printout of system capabilities.

     Simultaneous with the announcement of the consumer education program, the
IMA also debuted its specifications for a uniform label for CD-ROM titles. The
program promotes a uniform labeling system for on-pack display that exactly
matches the format and type of information on the CD MATCH printout. Combined,
these two elements will enable consumers to make more informed CD-ROM title
purchasing decisions, improve user satisfaction levels, and reduce returns.

     The IMA CD MATCH software is available at no charge through the
association's home page on the World Wide Web (ftp://ftp.ima.org/pub/cdmatch).
The free software will also be available to consumers via magazine bundles and
companion packs in early 1996. For more information, contact the IMA at
cdmatch@ima.org.

MULTIMEDIA FRONTIERS

     If you're really interested in multimedia technology, read on: Here are
examples of some of the more interesting uses that we've heard of. The four
applications described below may not be what you would use in your library,
but they do represent new frontiers. If you learn about multimedia and know
where it's headed, you'll understand what effects it may have on your
environment in the future.

AN INTERNET-LINKED MONTHLY CD

     "Multimedia World," a publication for multimedia enthusiasts, and
CompuServe have joined forces to produce the first monthly CD-ROM magazine
with hyperlinks to the Internet and to an online service. "Multimedia World"
is distributing this special edition of its CD-ROM companion "Multimedia World
LIVE!" with every newsstand copy, at a cover price of $4.95.

     The customized version of "LIVE!" incorporates numerous hyperlinks to
both the CompuServe Information Service and the World Wide Web using
CompuServe's interface software. By selecting one of these hyperlinks, "LIVE!"
users then may launch directly to related sites either on the CompuServe
Information Service or on the Web, such as "Multimedia World's" home page at
http://www.mmworld.com.

     "`LIVE's' seamless integration of online hyperlinks represents a new and
dynamic way for our readers to access the information they want," said Russell
Glitman, editorial director of "Multimedia World." "If readers are interested
in more background on a certain topic, a link can connect them immediately to
additional editorial content that resides online."

     The November issue of "LIVE!" contained linked articles on "Multimedia
World's" cover story for that month and an interactive test report of video
cards, CD-ROM drives, and multimedia systems. In these interactive reports,
users rank their own criteria to generate results customized to their personal
preferences.

     "LIVE!" will also include a selection of games, utilities, clip media,
and drivers, as well as links to popular online software libraries.
"Multimedia World" has reserved 200 megabytes on "LIVE!"  for interactive
advertising, software demos, and hyperlinks to Web sites.

     "`Multimedia World LIVE!' is a natural extension of our mission--to reach
and inform the mediaphile," explained Greg Mason, publisher of "Multimedia
World."

     Multimedia World is privately held and published in San Francisco by PC
World Communications, a subsidiary of International Data Group. For more
information, contact Scott Laughlin of PC World Communications, 415/978-3329.

A 24-HOUR ENTERTAINMENT CHANNEL ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB

     Online entertainment developer and consumer Internet access provider Only
Multimedia & The Wave Network, Inc. has launched its OMI Channel, featuring
original programs and live entertainment.

     The first programming concept of its kind to be implemented on the World
Wide Web, the company claims, the OMI Channel is accessible at
http://www.only.com and features a complete slate of regularly scheduled
original entertainment, comedy, news, drama, and lifestyle programming.

     "As a national Internet service provider and developer of original World
Wide Web entertainment, the OMI Channel will allow us to leverage our
resources and present the online industry with a business model that makes a
lot of sense," said John K. Sloatman, president of Only Multimedia & The Wave
Network, Inc.

     Among the many original and light-hearted OMI Channel programs are "Only
Soap," an episodic soap opera complete with sex, romance, murder, and
intrigue; "Frankly Zappa," which takes viewers into the streets of Los Angeles
in search of Frank; and OMI's own versions of an exercise program, morning
news, daytime talk, and entertainment coverage. OMI is accepting third-party
program proposals.

     The OMI Channel will also feature a strong music industry presence,
including several radio stations, each with their own unique domain and online
programming schedules. The company has already brought a visual aspect to
radio; it has created the Jimi Hendrix Foundation home page and has produced
several live concerts.

     Only Multimedia & The Wave Network, Inc. says it is the first company to
use a fleet of multimedia vans to cover live events on the World Wide Web in
real time using photos, video, and live text, a feature that will be called
upon extensively in daily OMI Channel programming.

     For more information about Only Multimedia & The Wave Network, Inc. and
the OMI Channel, contact Kathryn Thyne at 818/753-0037 or visit the Web sites
at http://www.wavenet.com and http://www.only.com.

A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR PHOTO-REALISTIC MULTIMEDIA

     A new multimedia production company has introduced a new multimedia
technology that combines photo-realistic backgrounds with live actor
animations to produce more detail than normal 3-D images.

     Two experts in multimedia production and publishing have formed a new
multimedia production house called The Armchair Travel Company, Ltd. It has
been co-founded by William Donelson, who spent 10 years with the Media Lab at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and William Beckett,
who has many years of experience with leading U.K. multimedia publishing
companies, including Virgin Interactive Entertainment. The new technology,
called Virtual Travel, was debuted in the company's first CD-ROM game, a
murder mystery called "Foul Play--Mystery At Awkward Manor."

     Virtual Travel uses special photographic techniques and computer software
to simulate the experience of walking through an environment and turning
around to examine it from all angles. The technique uses still frames which
are then made into movie walkways and panoramas. Virtual Travel can use
software specifically developed by Armchair Travel when it is necessary for
animations of live actors to be inserted into the panoramas. Alternatively, it
can use Apple's QuickTimeVR, which has other advantages but does not currently
offer superimposition of animations.

     "Photographic imagery can provide infinitely more detail than even the
most carefully rendered 3D imagery," asserted Donelson, who first conceived of
the Virtual Travel technology in the mid-1970s while working at MIT.

     "The excellent quality achievable using these techniques, combined with
the fast postproduction of Apple's QuickTimeVR technology, is set to
revolutionize the creation of background imagery in multimedia software,"
Donelson said. "You can soon expect to see high-quality interactive tours of
fascinating locations around the world, as well as the innovative use of these
techniques in games."

     Beckett, who has produced multimedia titles that have won British,
American, and European awards, is directing the new company's marketing
efforts.

     The Armchair Travel Company has worked closely with the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Apple Computer on the innovative use of
Virtual Travel. Besides its West London office, the company has a
manufacturing and sales base in Memphis.

     For more information, in the U.S. call 800/843-9497, or contact the
London office at 44-171-386-5454, Fax: 44-171-386-5455, e-mail:

AUTO-GRAPHICS' IMPACT/ONLINE GETS TEXAS SCHOOL LIBRARIES CONNECTED

     The Texas Education Agency (TEA) is implementing a statewide technology
initiative known as the Texas Library Connection (TLC). Through this
initiative, it will provide current, relevant information to all citizens of
its school communities regardless of geographic location or district size.
Based on input from the library community, the Instructional Technology
Division of TEA will work with Auto-Graphics Inc. of Pomona, California, to
implement two related information resources projects through this initiative.

     The first resource to be developed identifies the actual, physical
location of books, audio and video tapes, computer software, filmstrips, and
other audio-visual resources by merging all the electronic records of school
library resources into one database. Until now, Texas did not have a statewide
resource-sharing database. The new database, called the TLC union catalog,
identifies the needed book or audiovisual item and points to the location of
the item at the user's local library or at any other district, regional, or
state library.

     The second resource provided by TLC is the electronic full text of
magazines, journals, newspapers, and other informational databases that can be
accessed remotely. Students searching for subjects in these databases will
find the entire magazine or newspaper article about that subject, rather than
simply a citation referring to an article in a newspaper or magazine that may
or may not be available in the student's local library.

     "In order to succeed," said Anita Givens, senior director for
instructional technology, "students must learn the skills necessary to
discover and select relevant information and to use that information to
accomplish specific objectives. TLC provides Texas students with the
opportunity to learn real-world information utilization skills and with access
to an expanded world of resources."

     Students statewide will be able to access Impact/ONLINE and the TLC
database either through direct connections to the Internet or through dial-up
services provided by another state initiative, TENET, the Texas Education
NETwork. Utilizing the TEA's Internet network, TENET, which is already in
place, provided a significant cost savings to the state.

     The diverse geographical aspects of Texas have made connecting the
libraries that serve Texas' 3.6 million students in over 1,000 school
districts a challenge. Gloria McClanahan, director of library media services,
said, "One vital part of this initiative is to ensure universal information
access to students throughout the state of Texas, especially those students
who reside in remote, rural areas."

     Auto-Graphics originally made the database available through the use of
client/server software, but the company also developed a World Wide Web
location so that the database is accessible to any individual using the
Internet with any type of software and hardware. Students can simply do a
search from their school library, and if the resource is at another library,
they can request that the item be sent to their local school library by
creating an interlibrary loan request.

     "Impact/ONLINE will give the state of Texas the ability to provide
resource sharing to every school," said William Kliss, vice president of sales
and marketing at Auto-Graphics. "It will remove the walls from the school
libraries, allowing students to quickly search a much greater resource and
obtain expensive or difficult-to-find materials easily."

     Impact/ONLINE builds in ease-of-use features designed to make students
self-sufficient when accessing information. This includes user-friendly
interfaces and context-sensitive help messages. It also provides librarians
with time-saving cataloging tools for preparing books and other information
resources, enabling these materials to be easily located. Librarians will
minimize the amount of time spent identifying and cataloging material to
enable them to spend more time with students and staff.

     With the advent of Impact/ONLINE, schools that are not currently
automated will have increased choices available to them to automate and have
their records included in the statewide database. This further increases
access to information for students and others throughout the state. There is
also a telecommunications infrastructure initiative in progress that is to
focus on rural areas, with the goal of connecting all remote area schools and
libraries, as well as for use with telemedicine.

     For more information, contact Auto-Graphics, 800/776-6939, 909/595-7204,
Fax: 909/595-3506.

LEWIS AND CLARK COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO CREATE DIGITAL LIBRARY WITH AMERITECH
LIBRARY SERVICES

     Dr. Dale Chapman, president of Lewis and Clark Community College in
Godfrey, Illinois, has finalized a strategic alliance with Ameritech Library
Services to support the college's technology initiative to enhance teaching
and learning by the year 2000. By providing its library with Ameritech Library
Services' products and services, including Horizon, NetPublisher, InfoShare,
and WebPAC, Lewis and Clark plans to transform its traditional college library
into a totally integrated library system.

     "We want to have the most advanced technology in the U.S.," said Chapman.
"As a forward-thinking community college, our vision is to empower students
and faculty by integrating technology into the learning process to develop
lifelong education. Our library will play a key role in making this vision a
reality. We plan to create the digital library of the future."

     Lewis and Clark plans to install the following products: Horizon, the
client/server library information system that includes integrated library
automation modules and a variety of easy-to-use interfaces; InfoShare, the
UNIX database server with Z39.50 support for locally storing and managing
citation databases; WebPAC, the server software for libraries that enables end
users with a Web browser to search any Z39.50-compliant database on the
Internet; and WinPAC, the graphical user interface for searching any
Z39.50-compliant database and gopher servers on the Internet.

     "I commend Dr. Chapman and his staff for their commitment to bringing
advanced technology to their students and library patrons," said Maribeth
Ward, vice president of Ameritech Library Services, Academic Market. "In the
near future, community colleges will need to have the capability to provide
access to library resources virtually anywhere, anytime. I see Lewis and Clark
as a model for other community colleges to follow."

     Lewis and Clark serves 6,000 students in all or part of seven counties in
southwestern Illinois. It is the only Illinois community college outside of
the Chicago metro area to offer an associate degree in library technology. The
college recently received the Illinois community College Board's institutional
quality award for academic excellence. The North Central Association of
Colleges (NCAC) recently awarded Lewis and Clark with a 10-year academic
accreditation, the longest term given by the association.

     For more information, contact Ameritech Library Services Academic
Division, Evanston, IL, 708/866-0150, Fax: 708/866-0178.

ITALIAN BOOK VENDOR'S RECORDS AVAILABLE IN RLIN

     Over 18,000 in-process records created by the Italian book dealers
Casalini Libri from 1994 through July 1995 have recently been added to the
RLIN (Research Libraries Information Network) Books file. This heralds the
beginning of a new service from The Research Libraries Group (RLG)--direct
access to and local use of major book vendor records.

     Libraries can use such records in several ways. They provide valuable
citations for new and recent publications. In the case of the Casalini
records, bibliographers or acquisitions librarians can export them with RLIN's
pass or put command to create order records in their local systems. Libraries
that have already received materials described in the records can export them
to use for local cataloging--or can do their cataloging directly in RLIN and
then export the result to the local online public access catalog (OPAC).

     With such book supplier records available in RLIN, individual libraries
are spared the local time and expense of evaluating, loading, and maintaining
these files themselves. In its negotiations with other book vendors, RLG is
concerned about keeping prices as low as possible in order to encourage use of
these records and to assist users in minimizing technical processing costs.

     RLG President James Michalko said that this step responds directly to
RLG's mission. "We're growing RLIN in many ways to enhance its usefulness to
research with early works, currently received materials, primary sources, and
unique cataloging, from the American Antiquarian Society's records to UN
Library data. This new kind of information from Casalini is of particular
import to collections serving international scholarship. It will be of great
value in supporting users of all kinds."

     The Casalini records cover materials of all kinds available in Italy, the
Vatican City, San Marino, the Italian canton of Switzerland, and Malta. They
describe publications in various formats including monographs, serials,
monographic series, microfilm, audiovisual, and CD-ROM. In the future,
Casalini Libri will be adding records regularly to RLIN via Internet file
transfer protocol.

     Casalini Libri order information is included on each record, but these
records represent far more than just a book dealer's title list. Each has been
prepared by expert staff directly from the published works, gives complete
bibliographical information, and, if necessary, includes notes in English with
additional details (which may not be evident from the strict bibliographic
description of the work) that Casalini Libri believes to be of significance to
selectors. Important noncommercial publications, even though they may not be
for sale, are also included. And in particular circumstances, unrevised
reprints, extracts, and theses are described.

     "This new service combines the value of records like the Casalini's with
RLIN's ability to integrate service into the local processing environment,"
said Linda Lerman, RLG bibliographic services officer. "Negotiations are
progressing with other book dealers who count RLG's members and RLIN users
among their best clients. A key goal is to help shorten the distance from
initial publication to having a work in the library, ready for use."

THE LIBRARY CORPORATION UPDATES INTEGRATED TECHNICAL SERVICES SOFTWARE

     The Library Corporation recently released a new set of enhancements to
the ITS for Windows Integrated Technical Services Workstation software. The
update includes enhancements and features suggested by technical services
staff at various levels:

     --   Several record saving options are now available. Users may save to
the active (master) file, an export (transaction) file, and/or an external
system, in any combination, simultaneously. These options may be toggled on
and off at will. A separate option permits users to save a single record to a
separate new or existing MARC file without altering default configuration
settings.

     --   A publisher's ISBN prefix may now be used to generate a Result Set
that lists all of that publisher's works.

     --   Users may limit a search to an entire country instead of a single
political subdivision. For example, to search for items published in the U.S.,
users may enter "??u" as the place of publication.

     --   Configuration changes that were made on-the-fly may be abandoned at
any time in favor of the last saved default configuration.

     --   Enhancements to the MARC editor make it easier to move among open
records. Users may now select multiple entries from a Result Set and have
multiple MARC editors open at once. In addition, users may move among open
records with a keystroke or mouse click.

     --   Users may now choose to search until a dataset produces a Result
Set, and then continue the search with the next available dataset. Users may
also choose to search all datasets at once and produce a separate Result Set
for each.

     "Records come up quickly, and being able to look at more than one record
at a time is most helpful," said Debra Mattingly, director of the Washington
County (Jonesborough, Tennessee) Library. "I find it useful to tile
horizontally so I can easily cut and paste from one field or record to
another. This is especially helpful with multiple 949 holding fields."

     The Library Corporation (TLC) is a principal supplier of automated
library management and reference systems. TLC develops and markets
computer-based bibliographic information retrieval and automation systems to
public, university, school, and special libraries in the U.S., Canada, and
around the world.

INFORMATION DIMENSIONS DELIVERS ELECTRONIC LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR
INTRANETS

     Information Dimensions, Inc. has announced the availability of its
TECHLIBplus OPAC for Intranets, expanding its TECHLIBplus electronic library
management system to include Intranet patron access. This allows corporations,
government organizations, and specialized libraries to cost-effectively
deliver their automated library services to a broader audience by leveraging
the infrastructure of the World Wide Web.

     TECHLIBplus OPAC for Intranets provides direct access to the library
catalog with complete item status details and user request features using
popular Web client software. The system utilizes Information Dimensions' BASIS
WEBserver, which integrates popular Web servers, such as those from Netscape
Communications Corporation, with the BASIS Document Manager. This provides a
secure environment designed for publishing and managing large-scale document
collections that reside behind a firewall.

     TECHLIBplus is a fully integrated library system designed for special
libraries and corporate information centers. It offers full library
services--acquisitions, cataloging, searching, circulation functions for books
and other materials, serials tracking, as well as control functions such as
ordering, renewing, receiving, claiming, and routing. TECHLIBplus is built on
Information Dimensions' BASIS Document Manager, which provides an
extended-relational database structure optimized to manage text and documents.
In addition to traditional bibliographic descriptions, TECHLIBplus provides
access to tables of contents, abstracts, and full-text documents, and it
manages compound documents containing text, word processing markup, graphics,
and images.

     "The Web is already an integrated part of the computing infrastructure
within most enterprises, making it an ideal platform for document-centric
applications," said Bill Forquer, vice president of marketing at Information
Dimensions. "Electronic library management is an ideal Intranet application
because companies will be able to achieve easier access to library resources,
lower their cost of computing, and improve ease-of-use and maintenance."

     Information Dimension's Intranet strategy is built around its BASIS
Document Manager and BASIS WEBserver products, which provide for managing
large-scale document collections. These tools include complete library
services, full-text retrieval, robust document storage management, link
management, document control, document delivery, security, and authentication.
Recognizing the significant role of the corporate library in managing
information assets, Information Dimensions has made electronic library
management for the Intranet an essential component of its strategy to deliver
Intranet-based document management solutions. Additional Intranet application
areas include regulatory compliance, competitive and market intelligence,
technical document publishing, policies and procedures, research, and records
management.

     TECHLIBplus and OPAC for Intranets are available immediately. Prices for
TECHLIBplus begin at $20,000 on IBM AIX, HP-UX, Sun OS, Solaris, and Digital
UNIX platforms. TECHLIBplus is sold internationally through Information
Dimensions' direct sales operations, value-added resellers, and distributors.

UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN MAINE LOGS 62 MILLIONTH OCLC ILL REQUEST

     The University of Southern Maine, located in Portland, logged the 62
millionth OCLC interlibrary loan request on October 20 for an article on
social work. The request was for the article "Integrative Model for Group
Work" in the quarterly serial "Social Work with Groups." The Department of
Veterans Affairs Learning Resources Center, in Togus, Maine, filled the
request on October 24.

     The 62 millionth OCLC interlibrary loan request came 37 days after the 61
millionth. "I was working away--just doing what I do every day," said Adrienne
Andrews, interlibrary loan assistant at the University of Southern Maine
Library who made the request. "I've been doing this for seven years and I
thought, 'If I hit it, I hit it, and if I don't, I don't.'"

     That laid-back attitude doesn't mean Andrews wasn't excited after
reaching the milestone. "I was really surprised to see the number, " she said.
"I shouted, 'I did it!' I think I startled some of the staff in the other
room."

     "We were all thrilled for Adrienne," said Casandra Fitzherbert,
interlibrary loan librarian at the University of Southern Maine Library.
Barbara Stevens completes the three-member interlibrary loan staff at the
library, a staff that helped make the University of Southern Maine one of the
top 20 lenders in New England this year, according to Fitzherbert. Total
lending and borrowing tops 20,000 transactions annually, she said.

     The University of Southern Maine comprises two campuses. In Portland, the
primary academic disciplines include psychology, business, and nursing. In
Gorham, the emphasis is on geoscience, music, and education.

     Located on the coast of southern Maine, the University of Southern Maine,
Portland campus, serves approximately 9,000 students. "As a state-supported
school, we also serve the general community," said Fitzherbert.

     The university library is located in a renovated cookie factory that had
been empty for some 25 years. "It's been renovated and now it's a very
high-tech, seven-story library in the heart of Portland."

     Northern Illinois University, in De Kalb, logged the 61 millionth OCLC
interlibrary loan request on September 13.

     The OCLC interlibrary loan system was activated in 1979. In the 1994/95
fiscal year, 5,400 libraries arranged over 7.5 million loans on OCLC's
interlibrary loan system.

     OCLC Online Computer Library Center is a nonprofit computer library
service and research organization whose computer network and services link
more than 21,000 libraries in 63 countries and territories.

     For more information, contact OCLC, Dublin, OH, 614/764-6000, Fax:
614/764-6096.

LOTUS INTERNOTES WEB NAVIGATOR BRINGS THE WEB TO THE NOTES DESKTOP

     Lotus Development Corp. has announced the forthcoming Lotus Notes Release
4, with its InterNotes Web Navigator, that makes it easier for users to
incorporate Internet information into their core business processes.

     The InterNotes Web Navigator translates Internet content directly into
Lotus Notes applications, allowing users to manipulate that information using
capabilities with application development, security, replication, mobile
access, and messaging.

     InterNotes Web Navigator takes full advantage of Notes Release 4's
intelligent agent builder, the Notes macro language or LotusScript to
automatically conduct searches and retrievals on the Web. Using this
capability, a user with responsibility for analyzing competitors, for example,
could program agents to retrieve Web pages from competitors' Web sites when
information is posted or altered. The Navigator could bring those pages to a
Notes database containing competitive information, then Notes would distribute
the updated information to the company's sales force every morning.

     InterNotes Web Navigator translates standard Web HTML 3.0 documents,
including forms, tables, photos, graphics, hyperlinks, and URLs, into Notes
for management in Notes. Notes users can also browse and retrieve Internet
information that exists beyond the Web, such as ftp, gopher, and Usenet, and
integrate it into Notes applications.

     Because InterNotes Web Navigator resides on a server, it eliminates the
need to provide TCP/IP on every client. Administrators have the option to
allow and deny access to specific sites, and frequently accessed pages can be
cached. Users can conduct Verity full-text searches, manage the data by
selected views (by category, by date, by name, etc.), or replicate the Web
database to their laptops for disconnected use. The InterNotes Web Navigator
also lets users mail Web pages to colleagues complete with hypertext links
intact, share bookmarks, or create a 'Web Tour.' Users can also rate favorite
Web sites and generate URL lists.

     The InterNotes Web Navigator and Lotus Notes 4 will support the same open
standards as the Internet, including TCP/IP and SMTP, HTTP, and HTML. The
InterNotes Web Navigator will ship in every Lotus Notes Release 4 client at no
extra cost. It will be available on Windows, OS/2, Mac, and UNIX, and will
support SPX, NetBIOS, Appletalk, and Banyan Vines.

     For more information on Lotus Notes in North America, contact Lotus at
800/346-1305.

KENT STATE UNIVERSITY USES OCLC TECHPRO SERVICE

     Kent State University, located in Kent, Ohio, is using the OCLC TECHPRO
service to catalog new books, backlogged gift materials, and university
dissertations and theses.

     "We decided to contract out our cataloging to reduce the cost of running
our technical services operation and to reallocate some of our staff to public
services," said Jeff Gatten, head of collection management at the library.

     Kent State University is sending more than 70 books by courier to OCLC
each working day. TECHPRO staff catalog the books and send records back to

ISI INTRODUCES RESEARCH ALERT DIRECT INTERNET-DELIVERED ALERTING PRODUCTS

     The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) has announced a new line
of Internet-delivered alerting services called Research Alert Direct (RAD).
These newly created services bring customized, affordable research information
directly to the end user's desktop. Six product packages--Journal Tracker,
Personal Alert, Professional Alert, Corporate Alert, Topics Select, and Focus
On--comprise a suite of profiled services available to the researcher and
information specialist. All Research Alert Direct products are drawn from
ISI's multidisciplinary database searching over 16,000 leading international
science, social science, and arts and humanities journals, books, and
proceedings.

     Research Alert Direct provides current, complete bibliographic
information that matches a user's profile. Information is drawn from the
contents of recently published journals, books, and proceedings as they are
processed for the ISI database. The product offerings include English-language
author abstracts as well as features such as author keywords, Keywords Plus,
and electronic ordering capability utilizing The Genuine Article (TGA), a
document delivery service provided by ISI. TGA processes all requests within
24 hours of receipt--within 30 minutes for special-request fax deliveries.

     Research Alert Direct products were developed to fulfill market requests
for flexible yet powerful electronic current awareness services. All of the
RAD products offer Internet delivery of current research information directly
to the desktop at an affordable price and at a frequency determined by the
user.

     Journal Tracker provides researchers with a cost-effective way to track
the tables of contents of up to 25 journals.

     Professional Alert and Personal Alert deliver customized, confidential
profiles to an individual or to several individuals within a department. These
profiles utilize ISI's unique capability to perform cited reference searching.
Searching on citations--the references or bibliographies published within
scholarly articles--provides users with the most targeted and refined profiles
on the market today. Unlimited profiling consultation is provided by ISI's
knowledgeable information specialists.

     Corporate Alert is designed to allow many corporate users to receive at
their desktops the tables of contents of journals at a reasonable cost.
Subscribers will work with ISI staff to set up individually defined profiles
from a selection of journals agreed to in the custom contract.

     Topics Select allows users to choose from a wide variety of predefined
search topics in the biomedical, physical science, engineering and technology,
and social science areas.

     Focus On is designed for users requiring substantial coverage of a
research field, along with the ability to search the data sets. These data
sets will use a Windows-based search engine to provide sophisticated
information search and retrieval capabilities. This product will be offered on
diskette or through the Internet. The Focus On data sets will provide broad
coverage of the current research literature.

     "We believe that Research Alert Direct provides a strong response to
critical challenges facing researchers today--timely access to affordable and
relevant information about leading scientific and technology developments,"
said Merle Jaffe, vice president and general manager of specialized current
awareness products, ISI. "Researchers and information specialists can define
personalized profiles or select predefined topics. The bibliographic data
delivered to their desktops will be customized to meet their needs, and
full-text ordering can be done electronically."

     Currently in a beta test phase, the Research Alert Direct products will
be offered to the entire research community in the first quarter of 1996.

U.S. PATENTS CITATION DATABASE NOW ON THE WEB

     Community of Science, Inc., a leading World Wide Web electronic
publishing company based in Bethesda, Maryland, has introduced a fully
searchable version of the U.S. Patents Citation Database on the World Wide
Web. The U.S. Patents Citation Database on the Community of Science is a joint
venture of Community of Science and CHI Research, Inc., an internationally
recognized research consultancy specializing in the development and analysis
of science and technology indicators.

     This fully searchable U.S. Patents Citation Database contains all of the
approximately 1.7 million U.S. patents issued since 1975 and, according to the
company, is the most comprehensive source of patent information available on
the Internet.

     The database is updated weekly and permits subscribers to search all of
the important "front page" information about each patent: number, dates,
assignee, inventor, title, abstract, exemplary claims for recent years, and
U.S. and international classifications. In addition, the database tracks the
"lineage" of each patent--how each patent cites previous patents or is cited
by subsequent ones.

     Citation analysis is a key enhancement of the patent database and makes
it significantly more powerful than other databases of its kind.
Technologically significant patents tend to be cited more frequently than
those that are of lesser impact.

     The U.S. Patents Citation Database on the Community of Science has
extensive search capabilities. All important fields in the database are fully
indexed and can be searched using standard Boolean query mechanisms. It is
also searchable through a unique approach to the U.S. Patents Manual of
Classification, which permits searchers to identify specific areas of interest
through a meta-database query and to navigate across the classification
hierarchy using browse-and-search combinations to retrieve sought-after
information.

     The U.S. Patents Citation Database can be accessed on the Community of
Science Web server at the following Uniform Resource Locator (URL):
http://cos.gdb.org. The service will be free of charge for all Community of
Science member institutions and available for $500 for individual accounts, or
somewhat higher for library and corporate accounts, for 12-month periods.

     For subscription and access information , contact Charles Wise at
Community of Science, Inc., 410/563-5382, e-mail: cw3@bestpl.hcf.jhu.edu.

JUPITER AND YAHOO! PUBLISH WEB SURVEY RESULTS

     A joint venture between Yahoo!, publisher of the Yahoo! browsable
Internet directory and search engine, and Jupiter Communications, a new media
research, publishing, and consulting firm, the Yahoo!/Jupiter Web User Survey
has been completed.

     According to the companies, the survey was designed to be the most
complete explication of the demographics and habits of the World Wide Web
community.

     The report gives a sharply focused picture of who is using the Web today,
what they are doing, what they want to do, and where the medium is headed
through the end of the decade.

     "The large numbers of current users accessing from home validates the
notion that the Web is truly a developing consumer medium," said Jupiter
managing director Kurt Abrahamson. "The World Wide Web will be a transactional
platform and a vital advertising venue. The survey results back up the
strength of the Web for all sorts of commercial ventures aimed at consumers."

     Some key findings revealed by the survey have been released. The home is
the predominant access point. Online services were found to provide relatively
few users to the Web as compared to direct Internet access. However, six in 10
users of the Web also have access to a commercial online service. Web users
can be described as both well educated and affluent. Substantial time is spent
online, with the average user's online time being approximately 20 hours per
week. A large portion of respondents (61 percent) reported that they are
spending less time watching television because they were spending time online.

     The executive level report from the Yahoo!/Jupiter Web User Survey is
available for purchase from Jupiter Communications. For more information,
contact Jupiter in New York, 800/488-4345, 212/780-6060.

NONPROFIT FORUM LAUNCHED ON COMPUSERVE ONLINE SERVICE

     A new online resource for charitable organizations worldwide has been
launched on CompuServe. The private subscription service is called NonProfit
Forum.  This national/international online information service brings a
multitude of tools to professionals, trustees, and volunteers of nonprofit
organizations and greatly enhances peer-to-peer networking.

     Online articles and discussion topics in the forum include: nonprofit
news and trends; professional and association news; leadership, management,
governance and trusteeship; legislative issues; financial accountability;
volunteers; planning; philanthropy and fund raising; planned giving; training
opportunities; computers and technology; career strategies; job postings; and
more.

     "Whether you're a staff member or a volunteer, running a charity and
raising money are tough jobs," said founder Sheree Parris Nudd, an 18-year
nonprofit veteran. "It can be hard to have the time to sift through all the
information that is out there to find what you need. That's where NonProfit
Forum comes in. If we don't already have information pointing to the resource
you need, we go out and find it for you."

     Because NonProfit Forum is a private service, a special CompuServe member
ID is required in order to subscribe. Software kits are available by calling
800/524-3388 and requesting a NonProfit Forum kit from representative #762.

     The first month of NonProfit Forum is free. After that, the subscription
is $15 per month for unlimited time inside the forum. (The fee does not
include the basic CompuServe fee of $9.95 per month.) Membership is open to
anyone.

TONI OLSHEN

     The Association of Research Libraries (ARL) has named Toni Olshen,
associate university librarian at York University, to the position of visiting
program office with ARL's Diversity Program. Olshen will concentrate her
research on diversity issues in both large academic and public libraries in
Canada. From November 1995 through May 1996, she will work with Kriza
Jennings, ARL program officer for diversity and minority recruitment, to
incorporate the Canadian research library perspective into ARL's diversity
program. She will also work with Jennings in developing model processes and
will learn to lead ARL diversity workshops focusing on Canadian libraries.

     Support for Olshen's role as visiting program officer is provided by York
University. The diversity program assists libraries in addressing a multitude
of diversity-related issues. Its primary concern is the development of
workplace climates that welcome, develop, foster, and support diversity. The
program seeks to develop an awareness of human differences that leads to a
valuing of and respect for these distinctions.

     An ARL visiting program officer (VPO) appointment is made when there is
a match between the Association's agenda, the expertise and availability of an
individual in an ARL member library, and the support of the member library
director. Inquiries about the VPO program may be directed to Jaia Barrett, ARL
deputy executive director (jaia@cni.org).

DATA/WARE DEVELOPMENT'S COLOR LABELS PRINT DIRECTLY ON CDS

     Data/Ware Development, a San Diego-based hardware developer and
manufacturer, has announced the release of ChameleonDirect, an automated,
4-color CD label printer. It prints text and bitmaps directly on
hydroscopically coated CD media, available from Eastman Kodak, MTC, TDK, and
Ricoh. These CDs accept the bubble jet ink used by ChameleonDirect and provide
near silk-screen quality color and resolution.

     In addition to providing a way to enhance CDs with a colorful logo or
other design, ChameleonDirect eliminates the manual labor associated with
printing and applying paper labels. Eliminating paper labels also prevents
out-of-balance effects in high-speed CD-ROM drives and the risk of media
damage due to label delamination.

     Additionally, ChameleonDirect requires no CD caddies or carriers, and
applies no heat or pressure to CDs during printing. The printer includes a
built-in motorized CD tray that transports the media through the print station
and returns it to the front of the printer. Customers don't have to deal with
awkward rear-to-front feeding or replacing worn-out cardboard print caddies.
The front loading/unloading design gives users the option of manually loading
individual CDs for printing, or using the ChameleonTransporter, labels can
automatically be printed on up to 75 CDs without operator intervention.

     For more information, contact Data/Ware Development, San Diego, CA,
619/453-7660, Fax: 619/453-2794.

ELECTRONIC COURSE MATERIALS FOR LEXIS-NEXIS MILLENNIUM INITIATIVE

     Under an agreement with LEXIS-NEXIS, seven law professors from Harvard
University Law School will create electronic course materials for law school,
authoring an electronic series of lectures and casebooks for use with
LEXIS-NEXIS Student Office. Student Office is a software suite of the
LEXIS-NEXIS Millennium Initiative.

     The Harvard professors will develop an integrated first-year law school
curriculum covering legal analysis, research, writing, and argumentation. They
will also electronically publish course materials that can be adapted to the
different needs of individual law school programs.

     First available for use in the fall 1996 semester, this four-year series
of electronic course materials will be based on the Folio Infobase software
platform that law students access through LEXIS-NEXIS Student Office.

     This agreement represents the first commissioned project of the LEXIS
Electronic Authors press, a component of the LEXIS-NEXIS Millennium
Initiative. The initiative is a program that integrates technology and the
teaching of law by working with law schools and faculty in the progression to
an electronic legal education program. Under the initiative, law faculty are
furnished with the software platform to transform course materials into
electronic casebooks and students are enabled to use their personal computers
to access and organize information from a variety of sources. The LEXIS
Electronic Authors Press is a new publisher of electronic casebooks authored
by law professors for students to use with the LEXIS-NEXIS Student Office
suite of software.

     For more information, contact LEXIS-NEXIS, Dayton, OH, 513/865-6800.

IHS ACQUIRES ERM'S ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY DATABASES

     The Environmental Resources Management Group has announced the sale of
ERM Computer Services and ENFLEX environmental, health, and safety (EHS)
databases to Information Handling Services Group (IHS Group) of Englewood,
Colorado. The new company to be formed, IHS Environmental, Inc., will be a
part of IHS Regulatory Products, Inc. and will produce and market the ENFLEX
environmental, health, and safety databases and the EarthLaw Environmental and
Safety Libraries.

     IHS Environmental will maintain a strategic alliance with the
Environmental Resources Management (ERM) Group and will continue to draw on
the resources of this international environmental consulting organization to
provide clients with environmental, health, and safety regulatory information
and to produce additional value-added environmental information products.

     According to both organizations, the combination of expert environmental
health and safety knowledge and  a keen understanding of the information
business will enable IHS Environmental to expand the products and offer new
delivery mechanisms for the constantly changing environmental, health, and
safety marketplace.

     Chris Meyer, president of IHS Regulatory Products and CFO of the IHS
Group, said, "By combining the relative strengths of IHS Regulatory and its
EarthLaw environmental database with ENFLEX and a strategic alliance with the
ERM Group, IHS will be a premium provider of information on U.S. and
international environmental, health, and safety laws, rules, regulations and
their implications on business."

     ERM Computer Services and IHS Regulatory Products are recognized as
leading suppliers of environmental, health, and safety regulatory information
with the focus on providing this information to professionals in industry,
government, and education sectors. ERM's introduction of ENFLEX for Windows in
December 1994 increased the client base and set a standard for environmental,
health, and safety regulatory products in Windows.

     ERM Computer Services' 60 employees will remain with the company and
operations will continue to be conducted from the Exton, Pennsylvania
headquarters. Brian Gurnham will continue as president of IHS Environmental.
The same editorial staff of environmental, health, and safety information
professionals will continue to prepare the ENFLEX-EarthLaw database and
support the ENFLEX-EarthLaw product line.

     The combined ENFLEX-EarthLaw product line provides current and
comprehensive coverage of federal, state, and international environmental,
health, and safety regulatory information. It offers extensive coverage of
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Transportation
(DOT), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Coast Guard,
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations and corresponding coverage for
all 50 states. With the addition of EarthLaw's industry standards and military
specifications, ENFLEX-EarthLaw is a complete source for environmental,
health, and safety regulatory information. These products are available on
CD-ROM, online, magnetic media, and the Internet.

     For more information, contact Environmental Resources Management Group,
Exton, PA, 800/544-3117.

INSPEC TO COVER ELECTRONIC JOURNALS

     INSPEC has announced that it is extending its coverage of journals
available in electronic form. The type of electronic journals that will be
selected for indexing must contain peer-reviewed articles, which are
permanently stored in an archive maintained by a publisher. Examples of
journals that will be scanned for the database include "The Journal of
Artificial Intelligence Research" (published by the AI Access Foundation) and
"TCAD" ("Technology Computer Aided Design"), a forthcoming publication of the
IEEE.

     To accommodate electronic journals, some new fields have been created on
the INSPEC Tape Services. These are Document Number and URLs (Uniform Resource
Locators). The Document Numbers will be used for wholly electronic journals
(or for electronic journals published in parallel to print) that give articles
a unique number. Where they are believed to be stable, URLs will be given both
at the individual article level and at the level of the complete journal or
electronic document collection.

     In addition, INSPEC is enhancing journal records from the start of this
year by adding the following data:

     --   The ANSI Z39.56 Serial Item Contribution Identifier (SICI) codes
     --   The name of the publisher of the journal

     This has previously been given in the INSPEC record for nonserial
publications. Journal publisher information only appeared in the List of
Journals.

     For more information, contact IEE/INSPEC Department, IEEE Operations
Center, Piscataway, NJ, 908/562-5549.

OCLC FIRSTSEARCH, EPIC NEWS

2.5 MILLION INSPEC RECORDS ADDED; 5 MILLION RECORDS NOW AVAILABLE

     OCLC has increased its coverage of the INSPEC scientific and technical
database available on OCLC's FirstSearch and EPIC services, with the addition
of some 2.5 million records dating from January 1, 1969.

     Published by the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE), the INSPEC
database is a comprehensive source of published reference
literature--conference proceedings, scientific and technical journals--in
physics, electrical engineering, computing and control, electronics, and
information technology.

     INSPEC records dating from 1987 have been available to researchers
through the FirstSearch service (on a per-search basis) and EPIC since
November 1993. OCLC has updated this database weekly since it became available
and will continue to do so after the addition of the INSPEC backfiles.

     "INSPEC is an essential resource for its breadth of coverage in all
fields of physics and electrical engineering," said Rick Noble, OCLC vice
president, reference services. "It's a cornerstone of FirstSearch's list of
engineering and technology databases."

EBSCOMAGS INCREASES FULL-TEXT AVAILABILITY

     OCLC's FirstSearch and EPIC services now offer the EBSCOMags database
from EBSCO Publishing. Featuring abstracts and indexes from more than 2,300
periodicals and ASCII full text online from more than 1,000 of those
periodicals, EBSCOMags is the fourth database on FirstSearch and EPIC to
support full text online.

     EBSCOMags is the FirstSearch and EPIC version of EBSCO Publishing's
MasterFILE FullTEXT 1,000 database. The database contains abstracts from
business, humanities, general science, social science, health, trade, and
vocation periodicals. In addition, it provides cover-to-cover indexing and
abstracting for "The New York Times" and "The Wall Street Journal" as well as
700 full-text consumer health brochures and 3,500 full-text Magill book
reviews.

     FirstSearch and EPIC users can search the EBSCOMags database as well as
other bibliographic databases to identify citations of interest. Users can
order delivery of the full text of the citations if the full text is available
in the EBSCOMags or other FirstSearch or EPIC databases, such as ArticleFirst
and FastDoc. FirstSearch and EPIC allow users to limit searches to citations
that have ASCII full text available online.

     The database contains abstracts and indices of periodicals published from
1984 to present, with the earliest full-text articles dating from 1990.

     EBSCOMags is available as a per-search and subscription database on
FirstSearch and is database 85 on EPIC.

     The FirstSearch service is designed for people who use libraries, with an
end-user interface that allows users to move through the online search process
in a few steps.

     EPIC, a full-featured online reference system that provides subject
access and keyword and Boolean searching to a variety of databases, is used

LILLY COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF COMMUNITY MEDICAL INFORMATION NETWORKS
OPERATOR

     Eli Lilly and Company and Integrated Medical Systems, Inc. have announced
that Lilly has completed its acquisition of Integrated Medical Systems, Inc.,
a developer and operator of medical communication networks. This follows the
announcement on August 3, 1995, that both companies had reached an agreement
in principle.

     Lilly acquired a minority interest in IMS as part of its purchase of PCS
Health Systems, Inc. from McKesson Corpora-tion in 1994. In partnership with
IMS, PCS became the first pharmacy benefit manager to offer electronic links
to physicians. The industry-leading information technology capabilities
offered by PCS also include online connections to more than 54,000 pharmacies
and 1,300 health plans.

     "The acquisition of IMS provides an opportunity for Lilly to forge closer
ties with health care providers and payers by giving it the ability to get
information quickly to people who provide care and make health care
decisions," said Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr., president of North American
pharmaceutical operations for Lilly. "The IMS and PCS networks and technology
working together will provide physicians with the clinically-based patient and
drug information they need to support the delivery of quality, cost-effective
prescription therapy that will ultimately benefit consumers. IMS delivers
practical, cost-effective communication and information solutions that are
actively used by our clients throughout the United States," said Kevin Green,
president and chief executive officer of IMS. "This merger will permit us to
accelerate further development and deployment of our networks and provide
additional value to our customers through advanced technologies and a broader
array of products and services."

     Lilly is a global research-based pharmaceutical corporation headquartered
in Indianapolis, Indiana, that is dedicated to creating and delivering health
care solutions.

     IMS, of Golden, Colorado, is a provider of physician-focused, electronic
communication networks and services delivering decision-critical information
to the health care industry.

IIA ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR WHITE PROPOSAL DESIGNED TO CURB INTERNET
PORNOGRAPHY

     The Information Industry Association (IIA) has announced its support for
a proposal submitted by Representative Rick White, (R-Wash.), which would
protect minors from accessing pornographic material on the Internet, while
providing incentives for online service providers to regulate material on
their services that could be deemed "harmful to minors." The language is
currently being debated by House Conference Committee conferees to H.R. 1555,
the "Telecommunications Act of 1995."

     IIA is the leading trade association representing over 500 companies
involved in providing and distributing information products and services
worldwide. Since its founding in 1968, IIA has been at the forefront of policy
decisions and initiatives that have shaped the National Information
Infrastructure.

     The White language would make it illegal for online service providers to
knowingly send directly to minors or to electronically display any material
that is deemed harmful to minors, ensure limited liability for Internet access
providers regarding content not under their control, and protect online
service providers from liability if they screen offensive material.

     "IIA and its members have always championed the responsible use of online
services. The White proposal represents a sensible balance between the need to
protect our children from pornographic material and efforts to invigorate the
Internet through the free and open exchange of ideas without fear of excessive
government regulation," said Ronald G. Dunn, president of IIA.

     Previous proposals to impose liabilities for online service providers
have been troublesome to IIA and its members, particularly because they failed
to reflect marketplace realities, threatened First Amendment rights, and
excluded incentives for users to act responsibly.

     "Government oversight and regulation is no substitute for market-based
solutions and parental empowerment. The White proposal would not only create
incentives for the development of encryption technologies, thereby limiting
the possibility of a 'chilling effect' on the Internet, but would give parents
a larger role in deciding what is appropriate viewing material for their
children," Dunn said.

     For more information, contact the Information Industry Association,
Washington, DC, 202/639-8262.

CALL FOR ENTRIES: UMI LIBRARY TECHNOLOGY AWARD

     $1,500 AND NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR INNOVATIVE LIBRARIAN

     Librarians who have developed innovative information systems may be
eligible for a cash award of $1,500 and recognition at the National Online
Meeting in New York.

     The annual Library Technology award from UMI honors librarians who
develop systems that make it easier for library patrons to find and use
information.

     UMI is now accepting nominations for the 1996 award. A special entry form
is not needed. To nominate someone, write a one- to two-page essay that
includes the name of the librarian and a brief description of his or her
accomplishments. Librarians may nominate themselves.

     Any library technology established in 1995, which directly benefits
public, academic, or corporate library patrons, is eligible for consideration.
Entries must be postmarked by March 1 and mailed to UMI 1996 Library
Technology Award, Attn: Thomas Pack, 620 South Third Street, Louisville, KY
40202-2475.

1995 WINNER--NAVIGATING THE INTERNET

     Last year's winner, Robert H. Miller, assistant library director at the
Salem (Oregon) Public Library, helped the institution become the first public
library in the state to navigate the Internet.

     Miller managed the final planning stage of a project that made the
library, in partnership with the City/County Data Center, the full-service
Internet provider of choice to the Salem area. The system also made local
government files available online to the community and established a new
channel for voters to communicate with elected public officials.

     As a result of his pioneering efforts, recognized by UMI and his home
community, Miller will serve as the independent judge for the 1996 Library
Technology award. The award was established in 1991 in cooperation with
Information Today, Inc., sponsor of the annual National Online Meeting.

HEALTH CARE ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY

     A new survey suggests that the information revolution is redefining
access to health care. Consumers are more accepting of health information,
including advice about treatment received through a telephone or online
service, even if it means giving up a face-to-face visit with a care provider.

     These are among the findings of a statewide survey sponsored by Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota (BCBSM). The survey was released recently
at a national conference in Minneapolis entitled, "Health Care on the
Superhighway: The Information Management Revolution."

     The survey was conducted last October among benefit decision makers in
companies with 100 or more employees and among Minnesota residents who receive
health care coverage from an employer with 100 or more workers.

     "The survey is the clearest evidence to date of how dramatically access
to health care is being redefined by both employers and employees," said Jim
Woodburn, M.D., medical director of national accounts for Blue Plus, the HMO
affiliate of BCBSM. "How people get information--and in some cases, even
treatment--is less important than the quality and convenience of the
information."

     Woodburn said that personal contact with care providers remains important
for many health-related issues, but giving up some face-to-face contact might
be an acceptable trade-off for health information received over the telephone
or with a computer.

     The survey asked consumers and employers to evaluate three different
electronic services. The most highly regarded by both groups is a 24-hour
telephone service in which a nurse diagnoses a health problem and provides the
caller with recommendations for self-treatment.

     About eight out of 10 health care consumers surveyed--77 percent--said
they would use such a service, and 81 percent of employers in companies of
more than 100 employees would be likely to offer the service if it was
available.

     A telephone or online service that provides information on health care
topics of general interest would be used by 63 percent of the consumers and
offered by 61 percent of employers, according to the survey.

     The third option posed in the survey--telephone or online directories
that list health care providers and specific information on quality of care,
patient satisfaction measures, and fees--would likely be used by 60 percent of
consumers and 61 percent of employers.

     Both employers and their insured workers and families place a high value
on the quality of electronic information services. However, convenience ranks
nearly as high as quality among the factors that would influence consumers'
decisions to use telephone or online services. The services' cost is cited as
an influential factor by only 38 percent of consumers.

     Cost, however, is paramount to employers, cited by 62 percent as an
influential factor. Quality--cited by 55 percent of employers--ranks second
among issues that would shape an employer's decision to offer electronic
services as part of a company health plan.

     "What makes the findings especially striking is the high acceptance of
electronic information services even though both employees and employers
believe they would depersonalize health care," said Woodburn.

     While majorities of both consumers and employers said that electronic
services could depersonalize health care, the survey found that, for 44
percent of consumers, electronic information might be a satisfactory
replacement for face-to-face contact with a health care provider.

HEALTH CARE IN THE YEAR 2000

     Both employers and employees are convinced that electronic health
information services will dramatically increase access to health care in the
year 2000, but they are less certain about the impact on quality and cost.

     The two groups were asked to assume that in the year 2000, 25 percent of
all information about treatment options was provided through electronic
services. Based on that scenario, 83 percent of employers and 77 percent of
consumers said health care would be more accessible. However, only 68 percent
of employers and 57 percent of employees said care would be more affordable
five years from now. Sixty percent of employers said that quality of health
care would improve, but a minority of employees--49 percent-- agreed that
quality would be higher at the turn of the century.

ABOUT THE SURVEY

     The survey was conducted by Rockwood Research. Interviews of both
employers and people covered by an employer-provided health plan were
conducted by telephone between October 19th and 26th, 1995.

     For more information, contact BCBSM, Eagen, MN, 612/456-1502.

IEEE-USA SAYS INTERNET FILTERS OFFER BEST PROTECTION FOR CHILDREN

     IEEE-U.S. Activities (IEEE-USA) is urging Congress to heed the growing
promise of Internet filtering technology as the best way to protect children
in cyberspace. With divergent House and Senate approaches contained in
telecom-reform bills still awaiting conference-committee action, Internet
content control continues to be a bone of contention between proponents of
federal regulation and free-speech advocates.

     "Internet filters work as a child-safety cap on the personal computer,"
according to IEEE-USA Board Chair Joel B. Snyder. "This technology can give
users and their families control over choices on the Internet, without
government having to resort to unnecessary and ineffective controls on the
free flow of information."

     Driving the legislative debate so far have been fears that the
unregulated growth of cyberspace has opened opportunities for purveyors of
obscene or indecent materials to reach children now going online at home and
at school. While some believe that federal restrictions on content providers
are the answer, IEEE-USA argues that government censorship attempts will not
work on the transnational Internet and warns that government controls threaten
to choke a vibrant medium founded on free information exchange.

     The 33rd Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting in Stockholm,
chaired this past summer by Internet pioneer and IEEE Fellow Vinton G. Cerf,
led to a new IETF working group that is developing the necessary technical
standards for reader-selectivity products. In the U.S., a broad industry
consortium announced in September that it will create a consensual
content-labeling system, the Platform for Internet Content Selection,
scheduled for release in early 1996.

     Most content-filtering methods fall into one of three categories. Host
access control features software packages that run on the user's computer and
exclude access to sources known to contain objectionable material or that
allow access only to sites designated as acceptable. Information filtering
using source labels would allow specific materials to be rated by their source
and filtered. Information filtering using third-party ratings combines the
advantages of third-party monitoring with fine "granularity," an ability to
sort materials within even a single document. Consumers could subscribe to a
rating service to select or exclude content based on that organization's
criteria.

     In the near future, responsible adults may be able to combine a variety
of technical approaches to create the most appropriate environment for
children in their care. For example, parents might install labeling-compliant
browser software on the home computer, subscribe to a third-party service, and
configure the browser to verify for age-appropriateness with the labeling
service before downloading text or pictures or connecting to chat groups. They
might also configure the browser to block children's access to items the
service has not labeled. Or, if parents want to permit somewhat greater
access, they might set the browser to consult the sources' own labels.

     IEEE-USA has pledged the efforts of U.S. engineers to assist in realizing
the full promise of the new technologies. In creating a cyberspace environment
appropriate for children, "technology alone is not a substitute for
conscientious parenting, adult supervision, and common sense," said Snyder.
However, he adds, "U.S. engineers can be part of the solution by educating the
public on the effective use of Internet resources, by helping to develop the
next generation of electronic filtering technologies, and by using their
technical know-how to enable their families and community schools to explore
cyberspace wisely."

Engineers, 202/785-0017.

NLIGHTN OFFERS WEB ACCESS TO PIERIAN PRESS DATABASES

     NlightN, an Internet-based information service, has announced plans to
offer a Core Reference Services package of four databases from Pierian Press,
a leading publisher of reference resources.

     The four databases--A Matter of Fact, Directory of National Helplines,
Media Review Digest, and Consumers Index--will be offered to libraries and
other institutional subscribers for an annual fee of $595. The price, which is
competitive with the cost of an annual subscription to the print volumes,
includes a large back-file of reference listings from previous years. In
addition, the package has been designed to allow up to four simultaneous users
at each subscriber site.

     "Packaging these four databases and offering them online represent a
fundamental shift in the way reference databases are delivered to
institutional subscribers," said Brower Murphy, CEO of NlightN. "Internet
access is a natural way to expand the resources available to smaller
libraries."

     "NlightN has made it possible for us to deliver first-rate reference
materials at a reasonable cost," said C. Edward Wall, founder and president of
Pierian Press. "This will benefit smaller public, school, and special
libraries that can now offer some 'core' resources they couldn't afford
otherwise."

     The A Matter of Fact database contains approximately 75,000 full-text
statistical excerpts on current social, economic, political, health and
environmental issues with more than 12,000 new abstracts added annually.
Approximately 40 percent of the full-text excerpts come from congressional
hearings and the "Congressional Record," reflecting public policy formation at
the highest levels. In addition, more than 1,000 serial sources are monitored
to identify the statistical excerpts included in this knowledge base. "Library
Journal" recently cited A Matter of Fact as an "absolutely essential reference
resource for the digital age."

     The Directory of National Helplines is a specialized directory of social,
economic, health, and environmental helplines for people in need of support
and advice. The helplines are sponsored by national organizations and agencies
that provide services to runaway children, work to prevent domestic violence,
offer AIDS counseling and research updates, dispatch emergency response teams
to handle toxic spills and other environmental disasters, provide enabling
technologies to persons with physical disabilities, and more.

     The directory also includes numerous TravelLines, providing toll-free
numbers to travel services and agencies that send free information or provide
free services for their respective areas of responsibility. The directory
contains approximately 1,000 resources, about 60 percent of which are national
service/support lines.

     Media Review Digest is a core media reference tool and standard catalog
of media information, offering a comprehensive guide to reviewed and evaluated
nonprint media. The version of the database offered online provides coverage
from 1989 to the present, including approximately 50,000 media resources and
more than 100,000 reviews, evaluations, awards, and prizes from over 150
reviewing sources and organizations that present awards. The media forms
covered in the digest include educational and feature files; videocassettes;
videodiscs; filmstrips; educational and spoken-word records, tapes, and
compact discs; CD-ROMs and other optical media; and slides, transparencies,
kits, maps, anatomical models, games, and other miscellaneous media items.

     Consumers Index provides access to more than 90,000 evaluations, tests,
alerts, warnings, and recalls of specific products, services and facilities
covered in about 120 periodicals and/or related services of federal agencies
(e.g., news releases from related agencies). Also included are citations with
abstracts for more than 70,000 articles on all aspects of consumerism and
consumer protection. Products and services of primary interest to consumers
are covered, including automobiles, motorcycles, boats, kitchen appliances,
audio and photographic equipment, food and beverages, health and nutrition
products, travel and vacation destinations. In addition, sources of potential
risk to consumers are monitored by the database, such as "incidents" at
nuclear power plants in the U.S.

     NlightN, a division of The Library Corporation, was formed in 1994 to
develop and market an online research service. Incorporated in 1975, The
Library Corporation is one of the largest library automation vendors in the
U.S., supplying more than 12,000 libraries.

     Pierian Press has been serving school, academic, public and special
libraries, and library patrons since 1968. Pierian Press publishes databases,
reference tools, and journals, including "Library HiTech" and "Reference
Services Review."

CANADIAN CENTRE FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ENHANCES CHEMINFO
DATABASE

     The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS) has
undertaken significant upgrading to the CHEMINFO database. Enhancements
include database design changes and important new content. CHEMINFO has a
broad audience including chemical manufacturers and suppliers, health and
safety professionals, and employees who handle chemicals in their jobs.
Produced by CCOHS's occupational health and safety specialists, the CHEMINFO
database contains practical, summarized occupational health and safety
information on more than 1,000 chemicals.

     CHEMINFO's chemical profiles describe potential workplace hazards and
control measures as well as detailed evaluations of health, fire, and
reactivity hazards. CHEMINFO also contains chemical-specific recommendations
on topics such as storage and handling, personal protective equipment,
accidental release, first aid, and international hazard classifications.

     All CHEMINFO records now include The European Union EINECS/ELINCS Number,
Hazard Classification, Risk Phrases and Safety Phrases; U.S. Department of
Transportation Infor-mation; and American Industrial Hygiene Association
(AIHA) Workplace Environmental Exposure Limits (WEELs) and Emergency Response
Planning Guides (ERPGs).

     In addition, developmental CHEMINFO records, which currently contain
physical property information, TLVs, PELs, and flammability information, now
include IARC, NTP, and  ACGIH carcinogenicity evaluations, NIOSH respiratory
protection guidelines, resistance of materials for protective clothing,
sampling and analysis information, and stability and reactivity information.

     Design changes to the CHEMINFO database include new print formats that
allow users to print all regulatory data and occupational exposure limits
information in one concise print format.

     The CHEMINFO database is updated quarterly on both the MSDS (A1) and
CHEMSource (A2) CD-ROMs and is available for as little as $250 Canadian/U.S.
per year.

EASTMAN KODAK DONATES $1 MILLION TO NATIONAL DIGITAL LIBRARY PROGRAM

     During a recent news conference at the 1995 Federal Imaging Conference in
Washington, Eastman Kodak Co. CEO George Fisher presented a letter committing
to the first installment of a $1 million gift to the Library of Congress'
National Digital Library (NDL) Program. The NDL Program aims, in collaboration
with other institutions, to digitize 5 million items by the year 2000 and make
them freely available over the Internet.

     "The Library is grateful to George Fisher and Eastman Kodak for their
support of the National Digital Library Program," said the Librarian of
Congress, James H. Billington. "Kodak, a leader in electronic imaging
technology, today demonstrates its commitment to the program through its
generous gift."

     During the news conference, Bob Zich, the Library's director of
electronic programs, narrated a demonstration of the NDL Program. The Library
participated in the Federal Imaging Conference as an exhibitor, and a Library
employee served as the conference's chairman. The Library's World Wide Web
site can be accessed at http://www.loc.gov.

     Private sector contributions to the NDL Program, including Kodak's, now
exceed $19 million. The program, which began in October 1994, has a goal of
$45 million in private contributions by the year 2000. The Library has
requested an additional $15 million in appropriated funds to reach its overall
goal of $60 million for the NDL Program by 2000, the 200th anniversary of the
Library of Congress.

     For more information, contact the Library of Congress, 202/707-2905.

QUESTEL OFFERS "INSIDE THE PTO ALERTS"

     Questel Publishing, a division of Questel--Orbit, Inc., has announced the
availability of a new electronic e-mail service. "Inside the PTO Alerts," a
derivative of the monthly newsletter "Inside the PTO," reports on
late-breaking intellectual property news and events taking place at the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), the Court of Appeals for the Federal
circuit, in Congress and at other venues.

     "With the dramatic growth of intellectual property in just the past
decade, the passage of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and
the proposed privatization of the PTO, there is a pressing need for IP
professionals to keep abreast of the increasing number of complex changes
occurring in patents, trademarks, and copyrights," said John A. Jenkins,
president of Questel--Orbit, Inc. and editor-in-chief of Questel Publishing.
"But attorneys and law librarians are very busy, so it is our staff's
responsibility to sift through all the news and deliver only the most
important to the desktops of these professionals."

     Recent "Alerts" informed subscribers of the U.S. and European Union's
failure to reach agreement on an important international trademark treaty;
congressional talks on copyrighting works sent over the information
superhighway; and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to hear a case concerning
the competency of lay juries in understanding technical patent suits.

     Other "Alerts" have covered changes in rules and regulations, policies
and procedures, and personnel at the PTO, which is under increasing pressure
from Congress to spin off from the Commerce Department and become a government
corporation. At present, "IPTO Alerts" is free to subscribers of "Inside the
PTO" and to others who request it.

     For more information or to subscribe to the "IPTO Alerts" service,
contact Questel Publishing, McClean, VA, 800/326-1710; e-mail:
IPTO@questel.orbit.com.

MADOFF TO BUILD TICKER PLANT
WITH FD'S TiPS SOFTWARE

  Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities Inc. plans to install
its own ticker plant using FD Consulting Inc.'s TiPS ticker plant
system. A long-time Telekurs (formerly Standard & Poor's) Ticker
III user, Madoff is expected to discontinue its use of the
consolidated feed product.

  Peter Madoff, head of trading and architect of the firm's
trading systems, declined to comment on the move. But sources
close to the firm say Madoff's decision to build its own ticker
plant is part of the firm's continuing effort to gain more
control over all elements of its trading operation.

  The new ticker plant will consolidate direct feeds from CQS
(Consolidated Quotation Service), CTA (Consolidated Tape
Association), OPRA (Options Price Reporting Authority) and NASDAQ
(Level 1). Until now, Madoff, an electronic market maker, has
been operating without these direct feeds.

  Not everyone thinks building an in-house ticker plant makes
sense -- especially when there are consolidated data feeds
available from Telekurs, Reuters and others. But not everyone
uses a price box to price nearly 10,000 automated executions per
day. At Madoff, more than at other firms, the bottom line depends
on the accuracy and timeliness of the market data source used to
price trades.

  As a registered specialist on the Cincinnati Stock Exchange and
electronic market maker in over 300 listed securities, Madoff
executes 95% of its trades without human intervention. Madoff
guarantees its clients execution at the best consolidated inside
quote for quantities up to 3000 shares. If Madoff's execution
price doesn't match the best bid or offer as it appears in the
NYSE's time and sales log, for example, Madoff is obliged to make
up the difference.

  Madoff won't disclose the data source it uses to price its
transactions. The firm is known to purchase data services from
Telekurs, Bridge, Instinet, Quotron and others.

                         Once Burned...

  During an average trading day, a time lag between a
consolidated data feed product such as Telekurs Ticker III and
direct lines from SIAC, OPRA or NASDAQ might result in a
discrepancy of a fraction of a point.

  But during peak periods of volatility, such as last October's
Black Friday, the same time lag might result in a discrepancy of
several points -- especially for trades in United Airlines stock,
for example.

  If Madoff had priced its Black Friday transactions with a data
feed that lagged the best bids and offers as they appeared on CQS
(the Consolidated Quotation System), make-goods on those trades
would be costly. Costly enough to easily justify the price tag of
an internal ticker plant.

  Electronic market makers obliged to execute at the best
consolidated inside quote can't afford to be out of sync with
SIAC's CQS feed at any time. For Madoff to operate with anything
less than direct CQS, CTA, OPRA and NASDAQ feeds leaves the firm
vulnerable.

  Apart from the issue of time and price discrepancies created by
fast-moving markets, consolidated data feed hosts can experience
downtime while markets continue to trade.

                        Speeds and Feeds

  Telekurs' Ticker III has been delivered at two different output
speeds, 9.6 and 19.2 kilobits per second, since Sept. 89, two
months after the product was acquired from Standard & Poor's.

  All new customers for Ticker III take the feed at 19.2 kbs and
Telekurs is offering the higher speed feed to its customers at no
additional charge.

  During the most recent October market break, Ticker III's 9.6
kbs feed suffered significant delays -- up to ten minutes behind
CQS, according to Telekurs officials.

  Recent tests conducted at a major brokerage suggest that
Telekurs' 19.2 kbs feed has substantially eliminated the capacity
problems of the slower speed feed.

MICROSTAT TO LAUNCH STOCK
QUOTE SYSTEM BASED ON NeXT

  Executives from Microstat Development Corp., a small quote
systems developer in Vancouver, are making a long pilgrimage
eastward this week to unveil a stock quote system and broker
workstation to the New York financial community. Called Omen III,
the system is the first such application designed for the NeXT
Inc. microcomputer, the sleek black multimedia box that Steven
Jobs' new company has begun to ship.

  Omen III is the third broker workstation Microstat has
introduced since it was founded in 1983. The product's
predecessors, now defunct Omen I and three-year-old Omen II, were
developed as simple stock quote systems for brokers who wanted
information from the Vancouver and Toronto stock exchanges. A PC-
based product with simple charting capabilities, Omen II still
has 200 users in Vancouver. Says Microstat CEO Fred Daniels of
the earlier product: "It's a hybrid of a dumb and intelligent
terminal."

                            Not Dumb

  With the NeXT platform serving as a base, the new Omen should
be anything but dumb. Intending to create a "financial
information gateway," the company began designing Omen III two
years ago, says Microstat chairman Wayne Crookes. Development on
NeXT began last May.

  But the NeXT platform differentiates Omen III from other broker
systems only in limited ways. Three Omen III features incorporate
NeXT's voice and image processing capabilities: instead of beeps,
limit alarms are voice-based; a client's voice can be recorded
and stored in the system; and a picture of the client's face can
be scanned in or stored on video.

  Other Omen III features include: simple and expanded quotes;
order entry and order history; creation of forms; security access
and password lock; electronic mail, including electronic
communication of voice, graphics and text; real-time and
historical charting with dynamic updating; commission calculator;
dynamically updated indices; automatic phone dial and audible or
visible reminder services; currency conversion; client user lists
updated with real-time information; dynamically updated lists of
securities ranked as they become more or less active; report
generation; and the Sybase relational database, which is offered
free to NeXT buyers.

  Omen III has two other real-time charting features: an intra-
day bar chart with three-minute tick intervals and a 60-second
tick chart. The company has also developed "peak and dip" limit
alarms, which alert the user to a stock that begins to go down
after steadily moving upwards, or vice versa. Unlike simple price
alerts, Omen III's limits are triggered by the price's rate of
change versus current value.

                       Development on NeXT

  "We are not porting to Next but building an interface from
scratch," says Soheil Zargarpour, Microstat's chief engineer and
research and development manager. He says the company chose to
develop the system on the NeXT platform because it was looking
for object-oriented programming capabilities, a relational
database manager, preferably Sybase, a multi-window environment
and powerful graphics. NeXT machines provide all these features.

  The system Microstat plans to begin selling this spring is
designed to handle feeds from a variety of vendors and exchanges
and is currently negotiating contracts. It has already contracted
to provide PC Quote Inc.'s data feed, which carries data from all
North American exchanges and is broadcast via satellite at 19.2
kilobits per second.

  Feeds will be transmitted via satellite, telephone lines or
cable television to a ticker plant designed by Microstat. A
fault-tolerant version of the ticker plant runs on two 386
microprocessors and two high-end NeXT computers with a 660
megabyte hard disk drive and 16 megabytes of RAM. Microstat will
operate its own ticker plant for Vancouver-area customers. The
ticker plant will also be available for purchase.

                   Between RAM and a Hard Disk

  The ticker plant converts exchange feeds into an Omen III feed
and broadcasts it to a NeXT server at the user site. The server
will be connected via ethernet LAN to "diskless" NeXT
workstations with 48-megabyte swap drives, Zargarpour says. Swap
drives allow memory to be shuffled between the RAM and the hard
drive.

  As a NeXT-based product, the system runs under UNIX and is
configured in the Objective-C language, which Zargarpour says
allows easier maintenance and upgrading of the code.

                           What NeXT?

  Microstat is seeking five beta test sites for the new product.
However, while the first commercial version of Omen III will be
available only on NeXT, Microstat intends to port the product to
other systems, which it will not name. The system will support
multiple news services, but has yet to determine which will be
offered initially.

  The company refuses to discuss the price of a fully configured
Omen III system, but it could get costly. At a recent talk in New
York, Stephen Jobs said Next computers were selling at around
$10,000 apiece, although those without optical disk drives can go
for about $2,000 less.

  Nor has Microstat come to any firm decision about how to market
its product, although the company hints that it is negotiating
with Businessland, which has the distribution rights to NeXT.
Businessland is helping organize Microstat's presentation of Omen
III to New York brokers this week.

MCGRAW-HILL ACQUIRES
MUNI GIANT J.J. KENNY

  McGraw-Hill Inc. has announced its intention to buy all the
outstanding shares of J.J. Kenny Co., a recognized leader in
municipal bond brokerage and information services. The move puts
Kenny under the same umbrella as Standard & Poor's Corp., which
markets the Blue List Bond Ticker, a product that competes with
Kenny's information services.

  The purchase includes both of Kenny's principal businesses,
Kenny Information Systems Inc. and J.J. Kenny Drake Inc., Kenny's
brokerage firm. Both operations will be added to McGraw-Hill's
Financial Services Group, which includes S&P's Ratings Group, S&P
McGraw-Hill, DRI McGraw-Hill, The Tower Group and McGraw-Hill
Securities Trading Inc. J. Kevin Kenny, the company chairman and
chief executive officer, will report to Harold McGraw III,
executive vice president at McGraw-Hill.

  "Kevin Kenny is going to stay on [after the purchase]," says
Michael Beauchamp, executive vice president at Kenny. "Pretty
much business will be as usual....we don't anticipate any major
changes."

  Kenny Drake claims to be the U.S.'s largest interdealer broker
of municipal bonds, based on number of transactions and total
dollar volume. Kennybase, Kenny Information System's flagship
product, purportedly is used to clear 90% of all municipal bond
transactions among registered dealers and dealer banks.

  Kenny Drake's broker screen system is used by dealers as a
trading tool. A Kenny Drake screen, which can be leased from
Kenny for $1,500 per month, displays live bids and offers from
the municipal dealer market.

                         Odd Bedfellows

  But the buyout will make for odd bedfellows. Also under McGraw-
Hill's wing is S&P and its Blue List products which compete with
Kennybase and Kenny Drake in the municipal bond information
business. The Blue List Bond Ticker can be accessed through
Telerate Inc. terminals; it is also available through Bloomberg
Financial Networks.

  Kenny says it isn't worried about the similarity of its
businesses with S&P's. "We don't see any overlap," says
Beauchamp. "[S&P] doesn't have a municipal data base -- that's
one of our core businesses -- and they don't have a brokerage
unit, and that's our other core business." A spokesperson for
McGraw-Hill declined to comment.

  "The Blue List, either on the ticker or through the
publication, tends to be more a library of offerings," says Cathy
Callender, vice president at Kenny. "We tend to have hotter, more
timely offerings."

                       Development Goes On

  The acquisition will not affect the ongoing efforts to enhance
the Kennybase bond information service, according to Beauchamp.
In late 1990 Kenny is scheduled to release Kennybase II, an
upgrade to this PC-based service that expands the number of
descriptive data items for each bond from nine to 100. About
1,100 clients use Kennybase.

  Kennybase describes approximately 1.5 million municipal issues,
and is updated as many as 14,000 times a day. Among the new
descriptive items to be included for each issue in Kennybase II
(where applicable) are insurance descriptions, adjustable rate
information, clearing eligibility, zero type, underwriter
information, when-issued information, refunded bond descriptions,
escrow and redemption descriptions.

  The Kennybase system costs $175 per month, plus 25 cents per
inquiry. The system runs in the DOS environment, as will
Kennybase II. Access to the Kennybase database is via dial-up
phone line.

LOTUS-INFOTECH DEAL FOR SIGNAL
AND QUOTREK FINALLY HAPPENS

  After months of haggling and paper shuffling, Financial News
Network, Inc. has bought Lotus Information Network Corp. (LINC)
from Lotus Development Corp. As expected, FNN will merge LINC and
its market data services with its smaller Data Broadcasting Corp.
business (Micro Ticker Report, Sept. 5, 1989). FNN is 45-percent
owned by New York-based Infotechnology Corp., which also owns
United Press International and other electronic information
ventures.

  The sale ends Lotus Development's five-year-old safari into the
market data business and consolidates three leading quote
services aimed at the individual investor -- LINC's Signal and
Quotrek and Data Broadcasting Corp.'s Marketwatch. Although the
purchase price wasn't announced, Lotus is thought to have sold
LINC for between $10-$12 million, or almost twice the $6.25
million it paid for the old Dataspeed business in 1985 (MTR,
October 1985).

  The combination of Signal, Marketwatch and Quotrek will serve a
real-time subscriber base of more than 10,000, about evenly split
between the two PC-based services and the portable Quotrek. These
subscribers account for more than half of all non-professional
real-time users of U.S. stock market data. (Marketwatch also
offers a 15-minute delayed service and Signal offers end-of-day
pricing.)

  FNN/Infotech's plan is to split the existing Data Broadcasting
Corp. into three pieces, the Marketwatch product, a network
services company and a technology company. Scott Dinsdale, who
was named president of DBC after former president Joseph Taussig
was elevated to Infotech, will remain in charge of DBC's network
and technology operations. Current LINC management, headed by
Douglas Smith, will run the market data services.

  The combination looks positive for both firms. Instead of being
an also-ran, FNN/Infotech overnight becomes the market share
leader in the low-end real-time business. It also acquires its
own ticker plant, a solid marketing organization and
relationships with dozens of third-party software suppliers. At
the same time, the LINC business will now be owned by a parent
that really wants to own it and will have access both to
additional Infotech content -- like UPI and Comtex -- and to
higher-bandwidth technology that will allow it to expand.

STANDARD & POOR'S CORP. ANNOUNCES
NEWS SERVICE AND CLIENT

  After months of hedging, Standard & Poor's Corp. has announced
the launch of a news service designed to compete with Dow Jones
News Service, (IMD, Nov. 27, 1989). St. Louis-based brokerage
Edward D. Jones is the first announced subscriber to the S&P
service.

  Called S&P News, the service delivers business and financial
news to the brokerage community, a market that "has been relying
on a single source for news," says Jeffrey Bell, S&P group vice
president for retail investor services. He says 7,000 companies
report earnings and other news to the S&P news staff, who turn
the information into stories that can be "more quickly read than
[those of] existing services." Unlike the Dow Jones service, he
says, S&P News "is not designed to be printed in a newspaper the
next day, but for real-time delivery and retrieval."

  S&P is also competing with Dow Jones on price, charging up to
40% less, Bell says. He refuses to discuss details but says S&P
"prices on a per terminal and quantity basis." Says Bell: "We
think it's necessary to provide a lower price alternative as an
important way for us to enter the business."

                      Discount the Increase

  Before volume discounts, Dow Jones charges $499 per month for
the first office, as well as monthly per-terminal fees of $21.50
for news retrieval and $13.50 for scrolling news. Some of Dow
Jones' recent price changes actually represent an increase. News
retrieval charges have been raised by one dollar per terminal per
month, and the scrolling news charge has gone up fifty cents --
according to sources at major firms.

  Those sources also say Dow Jones is offering a discount price
plan -- the "90/20 plan" -- that offers incentives to take Dow
Jones news in 100% of a firm's offices. Tim Turner, vice
president for marketing and sales for Dow Jones' information
services group, refuses to disclose details but confirms that the
company is offering "volume discounts based on size of firm,
number of terminals and length of contract." However, he says
discounts apply even if less than 100% of the customer's offices
take Dow Jones, although in that case the customer would get a
deeper discount.

  Turner denies that the new discount policy has anything to do
with S&P's bargain rates, noting that Dow Jones has long competed
with Reuters and Knight-Ridder. Instead, he claims the discounts
stem from "concerns on the Street for all costs" and says the new
pricing policy accommodates the uncertainty about staff size
currently plaguing the brokerage community.

                      He's Glad He Switched

  Cost is a key reason Edward D. Jones chose to buy S&P's news
service rather than the Broadtape, says Rich Malone, a partner in
charge of the brokerage's data processing operation. Without
disclosing numbers, he says it was cheaper for the firm, which
has a single broker in each of its 1,500 branch offices, to have
S&P's news service delivered directly to the brokerage's central
system, which then transmits the information, along with
Telekurs' Ticker III feed, to branches.

  Although its research and marketing departments use the Dow
Jones service, Malone says it would have been more expensive for
the firm to offer that service to its brokers, because the vendor
would have charged each branch office for the service. The branch
offices were already getting Marketscope, the S&P real-time
electronic stock news reporting service, but no full news
service.

  By redistributing the S&P service itself, Jones bypasses
intermediate vendors. Both Automatic Data Processing Inc. and
Beta Systems, which caters to regional brokerages, carry the
service. S&P is negotiating with other vendors, including Quotron
Systems Inc. and ILX Systems Inc., says S&P's Bell.

  Bell also says that while S&P headquarters houses 25 reporters
dedicated to its news product, the service can actually draw on
the resources of 800 editorial staff worldwide, most of whom
report for specific McGraw-Hill publications. S&P News is most
likely to draw on the information gathered by the 100 or so
reporters who are part of McGraw-Hill News, particularly those in
its Washington, D.C. bureau, Bell says. Each news service has
access to the other's stories and can choose to run them if they
are appropriate to its audience, Bell says. McGraw-Hill News is
geared to corporations rather than brokerages.

REUTERS TO LAUNCH MONEY 2000
BY END OF FIRST QUARTER

  Reuters Holdings PLC will launch its digitally delivered Money
2000 service worldwide at the end of the first quarter. The
release is part of the company's efforts to migrate data
delivered over its aging Monitor network to its new Integrated
Data Network (IDN).

  Money 2000 is a foreign exchange and money markets service that
will eventually carry all data currently held in the Monitor
International Money Rates (IMR) database, as well as Reuters
news. Money 2000 upgrades, and eventually will replace, the
Reuter Monitor Money Rates service and the Reuter Monitor Money
News service.

  Money 2000 will be delivered to standalone IDN terminals at 9.6
kilobits/second. It will be delivered to clients' internal
distribution systems initially at 9.6 kilobits/second over
Reuters' IDN-based RQF data feed, which is slated for release
early this quarter (story below). Sarah Dunn, product manager for
Money 2000, says the service will be available over the 56
kilobits/second Marketfeed 2000, which is also based on IDN,
"slightly later."

                    Enhancements After Launch

  In its first phase, Money 2000 will deliver a subset of the IMR
database in logical form. This will comprise spot, forwards,
deposits and cross rates for all major currencies. Reuters
intends to add money market instruments to the service in a
series of "post-launch enhancements."

  Until these enhancements are made, data not delivered in
logical form will be accessed in page format. Data, both record-
and page-based, will be accessed in up to three "zones" on the
same screen. This capability will be available immediately to
users of dedicated terminals. Users receiving the service via
RQF, meanwhile, will have to wait until that feed has the
capability of delivering page-based data alongside logical data.

  The record-page mix will be made possible by the use of
preformatted displays or "tiles" on the user's screen. A user
will be able to place one tile, fed by the logical feed, in each
zone on his screen. A tile is eight to ten lines high and 80
characters wide, Dunn says. The user can also place up to a page
of page-formatted data in a zone, depending on the size of the
zone. Dunn says zone size depends on user preference. In
addition, zones can be configured to hold users' own lists of
instruments for limit-minding.

                         His Latest Rate

  Money 2000's logical, record-based format, Dunn says, will give
the user more flexibility over the old Monitor-delivered foreign
exchange and money markets services, which use a page-based
format. "For example, rather than a client having to retrieve the
Monitor page and know that page code in advance in order to look
at a particular price," she says, "he could put in a code for
Deutschemark (DEM=) to retrieve the latest spot rate." Money 2000
will use Reuter Identification Codes, based on the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications' code, to access
rates. Money 2000 subscribers would also be able to feed logical
data into local applications such as Microsoft Inc.'s Excel real-
time spreadsheet.

  In addition to the foreign exchange and money markets data
already available via Monitor, Money 2000 will offer some futures
and options data from Reuters' Futures 2000 service. Money 2000
will also feature precious metals and sovereign debt overviews.

  Money 2000 continues Reuters' transition from Monitor to IDN.
Previously, the two networks have been discrete in terms of
content, with IDN carrying equities and exchange-traded data and
Monitor concentrating on the over-the-counter markets.

  Reuters has high hopes for the service. Speaking last month at
Mediaweek '89, a yearly analysts meeting sponsored by
PaineWebber Inc., Michael Reilly, Reuters' vice president,
investor relations, said the company has more than 100,000
terminals serving the money markets. "All of those are eligible
to be changed over to Money 2000," he said.

REUTERS' RQF, RMF WILL HAVE
THREE-TIERED PRICING STRUCTURE

  Reuters Holdings PLC's RQF and RMF digital feeds, scheduled for
North American release early this year, will have the same three-
tiered pricing structure as Reuters' other international data
feed products.

  Reuters has scheduled North American release of RQF, the Reuter
Quotation Feed, for very early this quarter. RQF is a record-
based digital feed that provides a window into Reuters'
Integrated Data Network-based Marketfeed 2000. Meanwhile, rollout
of RMF, the Reuter Monitor Feed, will depend on individual
managers of Reuters' regional operations. RMF, also based on IDN,
provides a similar window into page-oriented data that's also
carried on the Reuter Monitor network.

  Glenn Wasserman, Reuters' international data feed products
manager, says the pricing structure for RQF and RMF will be
applicable worldwide. He says the structure breaks down into
three components.

                    Multi-Level Configuration

  The first component -- functionality -- depends on the
bandwidth the user takes. For example, a feed with entry-level
configuration, Wasserman says, would provide simultaneous access
to a certain number of instruments in real time. A higher-level
configuration would give access to more instruments
simultaneously, requiring a wider bandwidth, and thus would cost
more. RQF can provide as many as 1,800 simultaneous updates to
prices of up to 133,000 instruments. The feed's top speed is 9.6
kilobits/second. RMF is also available at 4.8 kilobits/second.

  The second component is a service charge, which varies
according to the number of services a user is taking on his
chosen delivery feed. For example, the charge would be lower if a
user decides to take only Equities 2000 through RQF, rather than
taking additional IDN-based services such as the pending Money
2000 (story, above).

  Reuters will also charge a population fee, essentially a
workstation fee, for the two feeds. The fee will depend on the
number of workstations accessing the feed. Wasserman says clients
are contractually obliged to report usage. Reuters will further
charge clients if they redistribute RQF or RMF data to other
locations.

                         Monitor to IDN

  The launch of RQF and RMF is part of Reuters' effort to
rationalize its data feed product line as it attempts to
integrate its IDN and Monitor networks. The end result will be
the dismantling of the Monitor network and the use of IDN as
Reuters' only network -- a move popular with investment analysts
tracking Reuters' fixed cost structure.

  RQF is aimed at customers that don't require the breadth of
coverage provided by Market-feed 2000. Also, RQF would be
attractive to users without the resources to develop an internal
delivery system capable of handling such volume of data.

  The feed initially will be record-based only, Wasserman says.
But, as Reuters switches delivery of Monitor data to IDN, the
company will make contributed data in page format available via
RQF. "The RQF will be the first device on the IDN network that
will be able to supply both the IDN record-oriented exchange data
and what we have in the past delivered via Monitor -- the
contributed data," Wasserman says.

  Eventually, Reuters will use RQF as its standard platform for
delivery of both record- and page-oriented data, although
Wasserman says it will continue to support any installed
terminals receiving RMF or Monitor.

  RMF is essentially an upgrade of Reuters' RDCDF feed that will
allow the company to standardize its terminals worldwide on a
386-based PC hardware platform. RMF offers similar functionality
to RDCDF, except that it allows users access to up to 100 pages
from the Monitor database concurrently, compared with 32 pages
via RDCDF (MTR, May 1989).

LME BUYS QUOTE FEED SERVICE
FROM REUTERS AFTER FEES BATTLE

  After a protracted battle in which other vendors collectively
accused Reuters Holdings PLC of anti-competitive practices, the
London Metal Exchange has opted to purchase the quote system
Reuters developed for the LME. The LME will sell the feed to
third-party vendors for redistribution. The deal insures that by
June 1990, the system will deliver all prices simultaneously to
all vendors, including Reuters.

  After winning the bid to design and develop the LME's quote
system, Reuters had proposed that all third party vendors wishing
to distribute the feed pay Reuters a flat fee (Micro Ticker
Report July 24, 1989). Because off-the-floor trading information
was to be collected using Reuters Monitor terminals, these prices
would have been available to Reuters customers sooner. Customers
of other vendors would have had to wait for the LME computers to
receive and reroute the Reuters-supplied information.

  Vendors quickly formed a coalition to oppose this arrangement,
and their voices apparently were heard. Under the purchase
agreement finally reached between Reuters and the LME, other
vendors will pay no fees to Reuters. The exchange fee schedule
will be finalized in the next three weeks, and Reuters will not
get a cut, says Gerard Buckley, the LME's market information
manager.

  Spokesman for the vendor group, David Taylor, could not be
reached for comment, but a source at one vendor says that "it's a
classic case of Reuters going in and grabbing a monopoly. They've
done it before and they'll no doubt do it again."

                         The Metal Feed

  The system compiles LME futures prices from interfirm telephone
trading and from two open-outcry sessions, called Ring and Kerb,
that occur in both the morning and afternoon. Open outcry prices
are collected by LME staff members on the floor, while telephone
trades are entered into Reuters Monitor terminals by eleven LME
member firms. The data is processed on two LME-owned Hewlett
Packard 9000 Series microcomputers, one of which runs in stand-by
mode.

  In the new system, the only way Reuters monitor customers can
get telephone market prices is from the LME feed. The Reuters
Monitor terminals used to collect upstairs trade data have been
modified so that the prices are transferred directly to the LME's
processor rather than to other Reuters Monitor terminals on the
Reuters network. The LME says all vendors, including Reuters,
will receive the feed at exactly the same time. The Reuter
Monitor terminals used for price input have also been modified to
reduce data entry errors.

  Options prices on the LME's metal contracts will eventually be
included in the feed, Buckley says. Options are only traded by
telephone.

                          More Sources

  The LME is the largest metals exchange in the world, trading
copper, zinc, lead, aluminum, nickel and tin. Founded in 1877, it
has never had a quote system of its own. Interested parties had
to subscribe to vendors, like Reuters and Knight-Ridder Unicom
Ltd., that collected the data from the floor, or from market-
makers, such as Rudolf Wolff & Co. At the LME, trading is
performed both on the floor (open outcry) and off.

  "Most people, especially in the States, who think they're
getting an LME feed are actually just getting a feed from one of
our member firms," says Buckley. "What we're offering is
information from a combination of at least 11 of our member
firms, plus the actual LME staff on the floor of the exchange."

  The system was designed by Reuters and Investment Intelligence
Systems Corporation Ltd., a London-based software firm.

IF CONTENT IS KING, DISNEY IS PERCHED ON TOP

     It's a little early to gauge the specific impact The Walt Disney
Co.'s acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. will have on interactive
media.  Disney formed a multimedia unit eight months ago, but its
fledgling stab at the CD-ROM market so far has had mixed results. 
Although Disney recently joined forces with three Baby Bells to
produce video programming carried via telephone lines, for the most
part it has focused squarely on content and shunned direct investments
in the information superhighway.  But if content is king, you have to
like Disney's new position.

STATIC HANGS OVER DEVELOPING ITV INDUSTRY THROUGHOUT '95

Although no one could claim 1995 was the best of times for
interactive television, the worst fears of industry skeptics
were not realized either.

As the ambitious plans of both cable companies and telcos to
deliver near-term digital deployment fell by the wayside, a new
sense of purpose began to emerge based more on economics and
true customer demand than pipe dreams.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) didn't help matters
much; it clouded the waters with a patchwork of regulations for
telephone companies seeking to package and deliver video
programming that continued to unravel throughout the year.  The
case for the telcos, which saw numerous federal court cases turn
in their favor, finally made its way to the Supreme Court
earlier this month.

Many telcos also appeared to give up altogether on the video
dialtone (VDT) route, first pulling their Section 214
applications with the FCC and then eyeing other means of
delivery such as via a traditional cable TV franchise or
wireless cable.

The fuzzy interactive and programming picture did not stop
companies from embracing big-money programming/technology
partnerships.  The year saw the rise of two notable telco
consortiums - TELE-TV, a venture among Bell Atlantic, Nynex and
Pacific Telesis; and Americast - the brainchild of Ameritech,
BellSouth, GTE, SBC Communications and the Walt Disney Co.  The
year also saw Disney's bid to swallow Capital Cities/ABC,
Westinghouse's purchase of CBS Inc., and Time Warner's plans to
buy Turner Broadcasting Systems.

Which is not to say the year was without its feuds.  As the year
grinds to an end, U S West and Time Warner continue to trade
barbs in court over Time Warner's proposed Turner acquisition
and new blueprint for a company reorganization.

Following are the year's top ITV highlights as reported in
Interactive TV Strategies and its predecessor, Entertainment
Technology:

January 1995:

*     Nearly all of the telcos, except for SBC Communications
and SNET, win the right to own the programming on their VDT
networks in a case in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.

*     Rochester Tel wraps up its 52-customer VDT with a whimper,
and a question mark as to whether it will seek to deploy
commercial programming services.  The telco was to remain quiet
on video plans for the rest of the year.

*     The FCC gives Bell Atlantic the green light to provide
some programming for its VDT trial in Fairfax, Va.

*     BellSouth nixes its plans to have an anchor programmer as
part of the VDT  service it plans to offer next year in Atlanta
in order to win speedier FCC approval.  The anchor programmer
issue is to plague telcos throughout the year.

*     The FCC approves Puerto Rico Telephone's plans to conduct
a VDT trial comprising services delivered via ADSL and fiber-to-
the-curb technology.

*     The commission also OKs five of Ameritech's Section 214
applications to build VDT networks in the metropolitan areas of
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.  As the year
progresses, the telco all but abandons near-term VDT plans in
favor of providing programming as a traditional cable franchise.

*     Sprint's local phone division, Carolina Telephone in North
Carolina, makes plans for a VDT trial in Wake Forest.

February 1995:

*     GTE and AT&T can their plans to conduct a VDT trial over a
hybrid fiber/coax network in Manassas, Va., signaling AT&T's
move away from participating in trials using technology "that
may not be in use a year from today."

*     Zing Systems receives a patent for its interactive
programming delivery system and an endorsement from Hewlett-
Packard, which will include the technology in its KAYAK set-top
boxes.

*     Cory Mitchell joins SNET to head up the telco's multimedia
services decision.  Mitchell is to resign before the year's end.

March 1995:

*     More than 100 major media companies, from film studios to
special-interest programmers, sign up to provide content on Bell
Atlantic's Stargazer VDT trial/system in northern Virginia.

*     Sprint announces plans to test interactive marketing via
the San Jose, Calif.-based Interactive Network, in which the
company invested $5 million.  The initiative was to be hamstrung
at the gate due to Interactive Network's failure to stay
financially afloat.

*     Legislation is introduced in Congress that would allow
cable TV converters, and the digital converters of interactive
television, to be sold by manufacturers and retailers rather
than the cable operators leasing them to customers.

*     Howard Stringer exits his post as president of the CBS
Broadcast Group to head up the Bell Atlantic-Nynex-Pacific
Telesis media and technology venture, eventually to be named
TELE-TV.

*     Bell Atlantic drops AT&T as the systems integrator for its
VDT platform, claiming it would rather learn and initiate the
integration functions itself.

April 1995:

*     In their first foray into wireless waters, Bell Atlantic
and Nynex agree to invest $100 million into Albany, N.Y.-based
CAI Wireless Systems Inc.

*     Cable billing and subscriber management company CableData
gets its first telco bid to provide support for BellSouth's
planned VDT trial in Atlanta in 1996.

*     IBM debuts its Digital Library to help companies digitize
their existing content as well as create new digital programming
for a variety of platforms.

*     After numerous delays, Scientific-Atlanta ships the first
300 headend systems for the delivery of the Sega Channel.

*     SBC Communications becomes the last of the regional Bell
companies to win a federal court ruling allowing it to provide
video programming to its in-region customers.

May 1995:

*     Bell Atlantic pays BroadBand Technologies (BBT) $7 million
for the right to acquire a noncontrolling stake in the company.

*     Bell Atlantic asks the FCC to suspend consideration on its
two pending Section 214 applications so it can review the
technology.  Before month's end, the telco is to withdraw its
applications to build hybrid fiber-coax VDT networks altogether.
The telco says it will resubmit applications based on switched
digital video technology.

*     Prevue Interactive Services begins working with BBN Hark
to develop voice-recognition technology it will incorporate into
its advanced navigator Prevue Express.

*     Your Choice Television, the time-shifted TV brainchild of
Discovery founder John Hendricks, signs an agreement with TCI to
begin digital compression, signal delivery and national
satellite delivery of its service.

*     High-definition television (HDTV) continues to be a hot
industry topic as the government debates whether or not to
auction off spectrum and consumer electronics companies rethink
methods to get the technology out of the gate.

*     NBC announces plans to break its ties with America Online
and Prodigy to form a broad-reaching multimedia agreement with
Microsoft that will see the companies jointly developing
products to be distributed online and on CD-ROM, as well as via
interactive and broadcast television.

*     The FCC makes yet another effort to prop up its regulation
of telco-provided video with the requirement that telcos seek
waivers to run programming on their VDT networks.

*     The commission gives GTE the green light to build VDT
networks in Ventura County, Calif.; Pasco and Pinellas counties,
Fla.; Manassas, Va.; and Honolulu.

*     In yet another clone court case, the U.S. District Court
in Connecticut grants Southern New England Telephone (SNET) the
right to provide in-region TV programming.

June 1995:

*     U S West becomes the second telco to pull its Section 214
applications from the FCC.  The telco pulls its five pending
applications, citing uncertainty about the staying power of VDT
technology.

In a related interactive sign of the times, U S West abruptly
cans its in-room interactive hospitality service, CityKey,

*     Time Warner adds customized, on-demand news and sports
programming to its Full Service Network and lays groundwork for
its first bank-at-home application and on-demand pizza delivery.
Customers, about 3,200 at this point, still are not paying a
monthly fee.

*     The issue that would not go away - whether or not telcos
have the right to own and package programming on their own
networks - finally gets its day in the Supreme Court.  A
decision from the is expected this summer.

*     Pacific Telesis sets up another strategic move into
wireless delivery.  The telco agrees to purchase 100 percent of
the stock of Wireless Holdings Inc. and Videotron Bay Area Inc.,
both joint ventures between Transworld Telecommunications and Le
Groupe Videotron Ltd.

*     U S West and Time Warner continue to trade barbs in court.
This time the telco amends its lawsuit asking the court to
prohibit Time Warner from going through with its proposed
reorganization of Time Warner Entertainment.

COURT REAFFIRMS 'MUST CARRY'; CONGRESS DEREGULATES CABLE ANYWAY

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
and the U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., both have
separately said cable TV still dominates the multichannel
delivery of video.

Nonetheless, House and Senate conferees working on a compromise
version of telecom legislation loosened the bill's regulations
on cable TV even further than either the House or Senate telecom
bills originally did.  The conferees, though, are expected to
delay full deregulation of cable TV rates until three years
after enactment, backing away from the bills' original plan.

The legislation largely undoes the Cable Act of 1992, which
imposed rate regulation, and ends the cable-telco cross-
ownership ban, a key part of the Cable Act of 1984.

But another part of the Cable Act of 1984 sparked the FCC to
create its "must carry" rule requiring cable operators to carry
local broadcast channels.  The rule - an attempt to ensure the
newer medium would not eliminate broadcasting - was reaffirmed
earlier this month by the U.S. District Court for Washington,
D.C.

Cable operators, led by Turner Broadcasting, took their
challenge of the rule all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court,
which last year remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for
a rehearing.  The High Court, in a 5-4 vote, said the lower
court had not received enough proof for the FCC's case that
broadcasters would be harmed.

Significantly, the four of the five justices in the majority
wanted the case not to be remanded but overturned outright as a
violation of cable operator's First Amendment Rights.  Now, the
High Court will get a second chance to do just that, since
there's no question whether Turner will appeal the 2-1 ruling of
the district court's three-judge panel.

Writing for the majority, District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin
said there was no other alternative available to the FCC than
must-carry.  Antitrust law, he said, is time consuming and
leased access is costly while "many of the stations invoking the
must-carry protections are economically vulnerable."  Nor would
an FCC complaint procedure fit the bill, he said, citing the
"enormous administrative burden" of such a process.

Sporkin dismissed the challenge of the rule as an uncompensated
taking by the government in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
But, when he considered whether the rule is a content-related
restriction requiring strict scrutiny for its First Amendment
impact, he admitted the rule comes "very close."

But, he added, "we do not believe that they [at the FCC] cross
the line."

The very day the district court released its opinion, the
conferees on Capitol Hill held their second meeting in as many
weeks and adopted a set of changes to the vastly different
telecom bills passed by the House and Senate this summer.
Regarding the bills' language on deregulating cable operators,
the conferees chose the House bill as their mode, but loosened
its provisions even more.

Conversely, they imposed tougher conditions on cable TV's future
competitors - the telephone companies.

The House telecom bill, H.R. 1555, keeps the FCC from
investigating a cable rate complaint until 3 percent of the
cable system's subscribers have complained - the FCC now swings
into action on one complaint - and it orders the FCC to resolve
rate complaints in 90 days and to set only minimal standards for
set-top converter boxes.  But the conferees changed H.R. 1555's
language to raise the definition of a "small city" - one where
the cable operator immediately escapes rate regulation - from
35,000 to 50,000.

That, said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W. Va., will only aggravate
President Clinton's concerns that the bill goes too far on cable
rate deregulation.  The president has threatened a veto, citing
that very concern.

Regarding telco-provided video, the conferees also hewed to the
House language, but again with big revisions.  Although H.R.
1555 would have let telcos operate "video platforms" such as
video dialtone (VDT) networks under reduced regulation, the
conferees instead required VDT-type networks to conform to a
modified version of the Title VI rules governing cable TV.  A
telco won't have to get local franchise agreements, but will
have to make at least two-thirds of its capacity available to
unaffiliated programmers.

That's the very sort of "must carry" rule cable operators
protest.  Telcos say it will rob them of much of the opportunity
to cash in on programming, the source of the real money in VDT.

While deregulating cable TV, the conferees also gave a big
benefit to cable's old nemesis, the broadcasters.  The latest
changes make broadcasters the only ones able to receive licenses
for the 6 Mhz of spectrum set aside by the FCC for "advanced
television (ATV)" -even though the spectrum also can be used for
paging or mobile data.  The spectrum is valued at $35 billion to
$100 billion but the conferees eliminated language from the bill
that would have the spectrum auctioned.

As for broadcasters' existing analog spectrum, which the FCC
would like to regain so that it can be auctioned, the conferees
eliminated any criteria from the bill for determining when the
spectrum must be returned.

The conferees are deregulating cable TV, in part, so that it may
acquire the capital needed to build networks to compete with
local phone companies.  The Cable Act of 1992 was said by the
industry to have hurt revenues, but the FCC last week issued a
report on cable industry competition that claims the industry
"posted strong growth over the past year."

The report said subscribership has increased by 2.5 million to
just under 60 million and average capacity has increased to the
point where 96 percent of operators provide more than 30
channels.

This hurts the industry's argument that it is suffering under
the increased rules.

The report also concludes that cable TV is still "the primary
distributor of multichannel programming to consumers," meaning
the FCC found there was only limited competition from digital
broadcast satellite (DBS) services or telcos offering video
dialtone.  It noted cable subscribership "continues to dwarf"
the combined subscribership of all competing services combined.

It also pointed to a increase in horizontal concentration of
cable systems, meaning that operators are consolidating,
particularly on a regional basis.  The industry now is
"moderately concentrated," it asserted.  About half of all 129
national programming services are vertically integrated -
meaning they also own a network - said the FCC, noting that this
total of programmers was up from 106 the previous year.

FCC'S 214 COFFERS DWINDLE AS AMERITECH YANKS ITS PERMITS

What once was a beanstalk-like stack of Section 214 filings
sprouting at the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC)
Common Carrier Bureau, now is fast dwindling to a mere mound.

Ameritech earlier this month relented its Section 214 permits -
authorization the telcos need to obtain before they can begin
building video dialtone (VDT) networks - just weeks before they
expired.  Current FCC regulations mandate that a telco act on
its permits within a year of its approval.

The FCC last December approved Ameritech's five applications to
construct VDT networks that would serve 1.2 million homes in its
service region.  Yet the telco, which has been plowing ahead
with plans to operate as a franchise cable operator, for now has
all but abandoned any near-term VDT plans.

"Right now it's full speed ahead with cable.  There were two
main reasons for the withdrawal," Ameritech spokesman Dave Onak
tells ITVS.  "We have been getting increasing community support
for us to operate as a cable franchise operator.  And the FCC
still has not finalized their VDT rules."

Ameritech currently has notched eight franchise agreements with
the local authorities primarily in the outlying areas of
Detroit.  The telco also has agreements with the Chicago suburb
of Glendale Heights and the Cleveland suburb of Berea.  In
addition, it has just begun the franchise process in Chicago to
provide service in that city's south side (ITVS Nov. 27, 1995).

Onak says Ameritech continues with its brisk construction pace
despite the fact that the FCC has yet to approve the
applications.  Additionally, Illinois cable operators are suing
the telco and the authorities in Glendale Height.

Nevertheless, Ameritech intends to begin offering programming
service during the first half of 1996, Onak tells ITVS.  "We've
got a court ruling that says we can do so, so why not?"

Programming will be selected and packaged by the Americast
consortium in which Ameritech is partnered with BellSouth, GTE,
SBC Communications and Disney.  Americast thus far has signed
agreements with Encore, Time Warner, Turner, Viacom and other
programmers (ITVS Dec. 11, 1995), and the original package will
comprise about 80 to 90 analog channels.

Ameritech is in engaged in franchise discussions with an
additional 40 communities across the Midwest, Onak says.  The
telco has no plans to attempt to provide cable service outside
of its five-state region.  "We've got enough to keep us busy in
our own backyard," he says.

During the past year a handful of telcos - including Bell
Atlantic and U S West -  have amended, and then outright pulled
their applications for commercial VDT before they ever got to
the approval stage at the commission.  Of concern is the rapidly
changing technological landscape and the commission's lack of
clarity on just how, when and where the telcos can operate VDT
service.

Bell Atlantic in the late spring withdrew two of its Section
214s and currently has only one 214 application pending, which
seeks to provide VDT service over a switched digital video
network in Florham, N.J.  The application was filed nearly three
years ago and spokesman Harry Mitchell tells ITVS the telco is
letting it sit because it includes up-to-date technology. Bell
Atlantic has no plans to file any other Section 214s in the near
future.

"The wild card is the federal legislation," Mitchell tells ITVS.
"We are prepared to make the filings if necessary but we are not
going to tip our hand if we don't have to."

The FCC says it will finalize its VDT regulations by early 1996
if the federal government does not pass telecom reform
legislation making it a moot point.

THOMSON BRIGHTENS STARSIGHT'S UNIVERSE WITH $25M INVESTMENT

On-screen program guide developer StarSight Telecast Inc. got a
hefty shot in the arm last week when Thomson Electronics agreed
to invest $25 million in the company, incorporate its technology
into its products, and engage in a joint marketing effort.

Thomson's investment, for which it gets 3.33 million shares of
StarSight common stock, buys the company a 13 percent interest
in StarSight, which also is owned by Viacom, Cox Communications,
Tribune Co., Time Warner and Providence Journal Co.

The proposed agreement also gives Thomson the right to acquire
up to 1 million additional StarSight shares during the next two
years at $7.50 per share and up to 1 million additional shares
of common stock during the next three years at $10 per share.

Under terms of the agreement, Thomson - whose U.S. consumer
electronics interests include RCA, GE and Proscan -  will
incorporate StarSight technology into selected product lines.
The cost to deploy StarSight ranges from $10 to $30 per piece of
equipment, according to Larry Wangberg, president and CEO of
Fremont, Calif.-based StarSight.

"Over time, as the cost of the memory goes down, this cost will
be reduced," he adds.  "Ultimately in the digital world the
deployment of StarSight will concern just the downloading of a
code, and that price, of course, will be very attractive."

Wangberg says the partnership greatly bolsters one of
StarSight's three core businesses - consumer electronics.  The
other areas of concentration are wholesale distribution and
licensing, which the company recently got into.

StarSight currently has agreements with 11 other electronics
manufacturers, and Wangberg says he expects they will react
favorably to the Thomson deal.

"I expect they are going to see this as positive news because it
greatly strengthens StarSight's financial position and ensures
that our business will continue to grow," he says.  Wangberg
also anticipates the Thomson investment, coupled with the recent
$5 million investment in the company by its current partners,
will carry StarSight through 1996.   He declines to project when
StarSight will stop bleeding red ink.

As part of the new agreement, StarSight and Thomson will jointly
market StarSight-equipped Thomson products.  "In some areas we
will be spending more money, and in other areas the spending
will be coming down," Wangberg says.  "It is very dependent on
the mix of revenue and the timing."

AT&T, HEWLETT-PACKARD PARTNER ON BROADBAND SOFTWARE PLATFORM

In a move Carly Fiorina, president of AT&T Network Systems North
America, called "creating a new center of gravity for the
industry," AT&T and Hewlett-Packard last week outlined a plan to
jointly develop turnkey broadband network solutions for public
and private wireline and wireless networks, including
interactive television.

Aside from developing technology and products for ITV - which
will come later down the line - the companies together intend to
create an open network software platform and develop
applications to run on it, according to Willem Roelandts, senior
vice president and general manager of HP's computer systems
organization.

AT&T Network Systems, which next year will split off from AT&T
as part of a separate systems and technology company, just weeks
ago at the Western Cable Show announced it was teaming with HP,
and cable modem developers Hybrid Networks and Intel.  The
cooperative plans to set specifications for interoperability and
develop products for high-speed PC delivery.

The announcement already has received "positive responses" from
Time Warner, Comcast and several other cable operators, Fiorina
says.

The new AP agreement advances their relationship much further.
The first fruits of the deal will see both companies immediately
selling  high-speed cable modems.  Fiorina says within six
months the team also will be building products and services,
eventually to include home shopping, video and telephony, around
a common protocol using HP's "Openview" and AT&T's "BaseWorx"
software.  The companies are working closely with CableLabs to
ensure their standard is the one adopted by the industry,
Roelandts says.

Within the next year, AT&T and HP also will introduce advanced
headend equipment and additional integrated data-management
software.   "We see the potential of this relationship extending
into the future beyond next year and we have high hopes for what
else we can do together," Fiorina says.

The companies together are taking a different tack than other
competitors, including Motorola, IBM and Microsoft, in a move
Roelandts and Fiorina say is by design.

"Microsoft is driven by a very different view of how the
industry will evolve, and I am relatively confident that our
view is backed by a lot of network service providers out there
that have invested a lot in their networks," Fiorina says.

"There is not much value to be derived from merely providing a
pipe with no value associated with it."

YOUR CHOICE TV  TO LAUNCH SINGLE-CHANNEL PPV SERVICE

Your Choice Television (YCTV) is planning to launch a single-
channel pay-per-view version of its time-shifted program service
aimed at making it easier for cable systems with limited channel
capacity to offer YCTV.

The new proposal, which will offer a limited quantity of popular
television shows, is the most low-tech level of Your Choice
service.  YCTV also offers a more  robust multichannel PPV
version of time-shifted programming and an application for real-
time video on-demand (VOD), which primarily has seen use only in
trials.

The single-channel service will come in six-hour blocks of
programming and will be delivered via YCTV's satellite, which
has been up and running since April.  Suggested retail price for
the new service will be 99 cents, according to Randall McCurdy,
YCTV's vice president of sales and distribution, who says the
price "is low enough that people don't think about the cost but
high enough that they associate some value with it."

McCurdy tells ITVS Your Choice already has agreements in place
with several cable operators for the new service, but declines
to offer specifics.

"We see this as a migration path," McCurdy tells ITVS.  "A lot
of our subscribers have systems that are currently in several
levels.  Some have real digital systems that they are testing
the delivery VOD on, some have systems ready for near video on-
demand and some are on the tail-end of the rebuild and are
locked into one channel for a good while.  This is a scaleable
solution."

McCurdy says the lower-level service is a good way for YCTV to
reach cable systems that might otherwise not be able to use its
programming.  "Initially there are a lot more operators with one
channel, so we will be able to reach a lot more people with this
first," he says.

As for YCTV's foray into the market, McCurdy says the company is
pretty much finished with participating in the trials of the
cable companies and telcos for now.  "We've basically closed
down the trial mode.  We are focusing on commercial deployment
now," he says.

INTERNET LIKELY TO DRIVE BUSINESS AGAIN THIS YEAR
Economic realities signal shift from interactive television

    In the world of interactivity, 1995 was the year when "interactive
services" and "interactive television" truly meant two different
things.
     The on-rush of the Internet through the computing platform meant
that interactive services predicted to thrive through the television
found a more immediate home.  Interestingly, the clarion call in 1996
of purists in the interactive television industry is that the Internet
is an intermediate step to true interactivity. 
      Observers say many issues are on the table for 1996, such as the
impending passage of the telecommunications bill now in Congress and
other policy issues, such as privacy.  In addition, many are waiting
to see whether cable modems will be deployed this year as cable
operators are predicting. 
      But most of all, said Peter Waldheim, chief executive officer of
the Interactive Television Association, Washington, D.C., the
"seamless process between PC applications and interactive television"
will continue unabated. 
     "We'll see a big push in the high-speed cable modem market to
deliver full-motion video to the Internet and create enormous
opportunities over the PC that don't exist right now.  And that, of
course, leads directly to the TV set," Waldheim said. 
     Many in the industry were caught off guard by the drama of the
shift toward the Internet and general level of interactive activity,
said John Hall, managing director, John Hall and Associates.
     "It's sort of been a Wild West year, '95," Hall said. " I think a
lot of us were taken by surprise by how much happened in '95."
     Indeed, Waldheim of ITA said companies are doing more trialing of
interactivity now than two years ago, despite some high-profile test
postponements. 
     Another key indicator of industry changes in 1995 was that the
base price the industry puts on bringing interactive services to the
home has dropped to about $1,000 per home, compared with the
assumption that an economic model would have to be between
$3,000-$5,000, Waldheim said. 
Thomas Cardy, senior vice president, Communications Equity Associates,
Tampa, Fla., said economic realities have led the shift to
Internet-based applications. 
     "Right now there's a proven market for online and computer based
services,   to the extent that you can interact and people are willing
to pay for it now," Cardy said.  "There's a business there.  There's
some question as to how you make money from an interactive television
service right now."
     Cardy said to a large extent interactive television is caught in
a generational quagmire, with older people satisfied to use their
television sets to watch TV. 
     "The folks who have the propensity to interact over some
electronic link, most of them already have a computer now.  The folks
that just have a TV probably don't have the propensity (to interact),"
Cardy said. 
     "Hall of Hall and Associates said it is doubtful that the
momentum built up in 1995 by the Internet's World Wide Web can be
sustained this year. 
     "I don't think it's possible or even healthy for the Internet and
access providers to grow at the same pace in '96 as they did the last
seven or eight months," Hall said.  "One of the critical issues in 96,
particularly for advertisers, is people are going to take a look at
the money they're putting in the web sites and take a look at the
bottom line and see what what's working."
        Analyst Connie Luecke, who follows regional telephone companies
for Duff & Phelps, Chicago, said many of those companies ae looking at
more immediate profit opportunities, such as in long distance, that
interactive television doesn't offer. 
        "I think they [RBOCs] have other things on their plate right
now that they're more interested in and more involved in," Luecke
said.  "From a perspective of what is going to be their bigger focus
and what's going to provide the most revenues and earnings over the
next few years, their focus is going to be long distance." 
   Robert Smith, president of the Interactive Services Association,
said companies will need to keep any eye toward regulatory issues in
1996.
    "You're going to see an increasing scrutiny of this industry by
federal and state government and legislators and regulators," Smith
said. "The online Internet industry is going
to have to deal with public policy makers in a very big way."

DBS COMPANIES SEEKING MARKETSHARE FROM CABLE
CATV operators keep upgrading to keep ahead

     The cable television industry spent its recent past trying to bar
the door to the euphoria of telephone companies inching their way in
on its turf through the lure of interactive TV.
But the rise of the Internet as an intermediate step to full
interactivity and the promise of quicker cash payoffs in segments such
as long distance have slowed some telecos' charge into video.
     Does that mean cable operators can retreat a bit into 1996 from
the threats to their bottomlines? Hardly.  Another relatively nascent
industry, direct broadcast satellites--those 18-inch dishes that
measure smaller than a patio barbeque--are giving cable a serious
scramble. 
DBS is "clearly an exploding market," said Harold Spielman, chief
executive officer of market researcher McCollum Spielman Worldwide,
Great Neck, N.Y.  And according to the Satellite Broadcasting &
Communications Association, 20 million U.S. homes will have satellite
service by 2000.
    "We know that RCA, for instance, has had difficulty just keeping up
on the manufacturing end of their systems, Spielman said, noting that
DBS street prices have dropped over recent months to below the
$600-mark for the equipment.  "I suspect we'll see the prices come
down more."

Fastest-Seller in History

     The largest DBS provider DirecTV Inc., a unit of Hughes
Electronic Corp. in El Segundo, Calif., for instance, unabashedly
calls DBS "the fastest selling consumer electronics product in
history."  Linda Brill, DirecTV director of communications, said the
service is up to 1.1 million subscribers after going nationwide only
in October 1994.
     DBS companies say they beat cable in choice, price and
variety--offering some 175 channels, including 60 pay-per-view
channels, and $2.99 movies every half hour.  And sports packages, such
with public policy makers in a very big way."
     The onslaught from DBS isn't expected to stop anytime soon. 
EchoStar Communications Corp., Englewood, Colo., successfully launched
its satellite into orbit Dec. 28, 1995, marking its corporate remake
from large to 18-inch dishes.
     "Our buy rates are 150 to 200 percent; cable is 30 percent,"
chimed Brill.  "Cable has had a monopoly now in this country for 20
odd years and consumers have been chomping at the bit for an
alternative."

Cable Acknowledges Threat

   Steve Effros, president of the industry group Cable
Telecommunications Association, Fairfax, Va., concedes that DBS has
posed a competitive challenge, but one that is no different than, say
"Ford is...to General Motors."
   Effros contends that cable and its 55 million households in the
United States haven't lost households to DBS, but that DBS largely has
been a rural phenomena where people don't have cable access.  
    "We have not seen any significant reduction in the numbers of
cable homes," Effros said. "Indeed, we've had the largest increases in
the last five years since DBS started.  You could try to suggest
that...we would have even larger increases if it hadn't been for DBS.
But I don't know if that's true."
     Effros said upgrading has been a way of life for the cable
industry in staying topical and meeting competitive challenges from
all rivals.  
      The key hardware announcement at the Western Show--that giant,
multiple system operators Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and
Time Warner Inc. invested $175 million to purchase 350,000 Motorola
Inc. CyberSURFR modems for initial installation in April 1996--showed
the industry's resolve to sniff out immediate cash opportunities while
it awaits interactive TV. 
    And, for instance, Cablevision Systems Corp., recently announced a
$300 million investment in a fiber-optic telecommunications system in
northeast Ohio that will bring video-on-demand, computer connectivity
and interactive services.

Always Upgrading           

    "We're always upgrading," Effros said. "This is just a constant
infrastructure process.  We can't move as fast as an industry that
just starts off with a given technology."
    A recent study from Frost & Sullivan estimates that expenditures
for cable associated hardware and technology services will grow by
about 6 percent per year to 1999 to $2.36 billion.  
    Effros said much is riding on the cable industry's development of
modem technology, as a way to help beat back DBS "as soon as we start
interconnecting computers via broadband systems because it's something
DBS can't do."

Industry Must Do More

    Spielman of McCollum Spielman Worldwide said the satellite industry
must do more to explain to consumers what it has to offer.
        "I think that the service deliverers have done such a terribly
poor job of explaining in their advertising what this is all about.
The consumer really does not know," he said.
    Spielman said DBS marketing is reminiscent of the "obscure"
advertising of home video cassette recorders when they were introduced
some 15 years ago.
        "I think that's the same situation with this," Spielman said. "
People do not know what a dish will do, what they will get from it.
They have no perspective on cost."
    Additionally, as new companies see dollars signs in DBS, some
question whether rivalries among the satellite firms companies will
stunt the industry's growth."

TELEPHONY, CABLE PROPELSALES OF VOD SERVERS 
Storage demands are expected to maintain impact on prices

     Telephone and cable television companies will be the two leading
segments that will drive the sales of video-on-demand servers through
2000, a research report says. 
    Sales of servers, which initially will be priced high because of
their storage needs, will increase from $131 million in 1994 to more
than $1.3 billion in 2000, according to the report,
"Video-On-Demand--Technology and Economics," from  Hodge Computer
Research.
     Each segment has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, the
report states. 
    "Due to recent legislation allowing telcos to deliver video
programming, they will become very large players in this arena," it
states.  "They will be able to deliver programming to their
subscribers on their own telephone lines. [These lines] may be used to
carry normal telephone traffic simultaneously with the delivery of
video."
     There is no reason to believe the telephone companies cannot be a
formidable force in video services, the report says.  They presently
are delivering programming in numerous test locations--and the
barriers to telco program provision are rapidly falling. 
     Telcos also have "direct connections to nearly every home in the
United States, or at least every one that would be a candidate for pay
per view (PPV) Interactive TV," according to the report, released to
IVN's sister publication Video Technology News.
     Cable operators, meanwhile, already have a large installed base
of video service subscribers.  The report estimates that there are
58.8-million cable households in the United States.  They are served
by 11,217 cable operators.
    "Only a few firms currently offer ITV services, and those only on
a trial basis," the report says.  "Total subscribers are estimated at
fewer than 5,000.  Of these, we estimate approximately 2,000 are
served by massive banks of VCRs into which cassettes are manually
inserted in response to the customer's telephone call."
    The percentage of cable subscribers who also have bought pay
services has declined steadily since 1988, when 85 percent of cable
subscribers (42.4 million) bought pay services, according to the
report.  By 1993 this percentage had decreased to 72.6 percent. 
(Because of the increase in TV homes, the actual number of pay
subscribers increased to 42.7 million.)
      Video servers initially will be priced very high due to the
immense amounts of disk storage and RAM memory required to deliver
hundreds of movies to thousands of subscribers, according to the
report.  The two most significant cost factors in a video server are
the disk farm on which the video programs are stored and the RAM used
to buffer the video data prior to transmission, the report explained.
      Hodge predicts that VOD server pricing will fall from $1.35
million in 1995 to $797,000 in 2000.

CHIP INTEGRATION, 3D, COMMUNICATIONS EXPECTED TO STORM MULTIMEDIA
MARKET

     Three-dimensional graphics, improved chip functionality and
enhanced communications are the top three developments expected to
penetrate the home market for multimedia in 1996.
     But don't anticipate major changes on the multimedia landscape
before the second half of the year, according to key manufacturers and
industry analysts, who spoke with Multimedia Week Editor Judith
Abrams.
    The most visible multimedia enhancement expected in the software
and chip businesses will come in the form of 3-D games.
    "We see 3D permeating the graphics world, offering a slew of
features and performance that just aren't available today," said Ken
Wirt, vice president of marketing, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc. 
"By the end of the year, you'll probably see a significant number of
PC systems come 3-D enabled."                    
    More consolidation in the chip industry, with companies attempting
to buy each other and integrate several functions onto a single chip,
is expected in 1996, with companies that have strong markets in one
area (audio, video or communications), trying to expand.
    The current trend is to combine 2-D, 3-D and digital video, but
more functions could be on the way.
    Whether new chip designs make it to the motherboard is another
question.
    Intel Corp. is expected to deliver its MMX initiative, an
enhancement of its next-generation processor with multimedia
extensions, sometime in 1996. However, "I don't think it will be ready
until the second half of 1996," said Richard Chang, an analyst with
Bear Stearns & Co. 
    Cable modems are expected to impact the CD-ROM as a means of
delivering content, but they will not threaten the disc business in
1996.
    "The idea of delivering the kind of graphics we build into a game
through the Net and high-speed modems is at the moment a fairy tale,"
said Ben Tenn, vice president of marketing for Activision Inc.  "It
can take you two days to download the video we put on a couple of
CDs."
    Diamond's Wirt forecasts 1996 as a year in which transmission
companies will begin work on new services, but delivering service is
another story.
    Expect more advances on the Internet and in other kinds of modem
technology.  More PC manufacturers are expected to add digital
simultaneous voice and data modems (DSVD) to their products.
    Despite budget increases, CD-ROM prices are coming down.
    "Everybody's very concerned about the lower-end price points." said
Robert Peterson, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc.  "The average
price will go down because of the growth in the budget category. It's
going to continue to sell."
    Meantime, multimedia PC manufacturers are expected to continue to
drop prices, but a high-end, niche category that emerged in late 1995
will continue.
    "There is a market for higher-end, upscale game machines that were
popular during Christmas," said Bruce Stephen, an analyst with
International Data Corp.  "We will see more focus on the $1,500 price
points, but manufacturers will try to keep them up and refresh
features.

COMPANIES POSITIONING TO DRAW IN CONSUMERS
Pricing models, security remain thorny issues

     As the delivery of interactive service made a sharp turn in 1995
toward the computer and Internet--and for now away from the
television--the star of electronic banking suddenly has never shined
so brightly. 
          Financial institutions, interactive services companies and
software developers all are positioning themselves to get electronic
banking in the forefront of consumers' psyche.
          Toward the end of last year, Intuit Inc. and America Online
agreed to offer banking to AOL members in the first half of 1996.  And
Microsoft Corp. outlined its plans for banking software in December. 
On the interactive television side, Barnett Banks in Florida signed up
with Time Warner's Full Service Network to create a so-called
"virtual" banks in the Orlando trial.
       Procedures, pricing models and security concerns all must be
worked out this year, but companies that deliver electronic banking
services say the potential for consumer acceptance is high, based on
high consumer reliance on automated teller machines and voice response
systems, experts said.
          "What we're beginning to see is sort of a seamless process
beginning with banks using PC applications for interactive banking
that will lead to interactive television banking," said Peter
Waldheim, chief executive officer of the Interactive Television
Association, Washington, D.C., which plans to release a study in the
first quarter of the year, "Interactive Banking at Home '96."
       "1996 will be a terrific year in terms of expanding the numbers
of banks now beginning to map their banks' future in electronic
media," Waldheim said.
    Indeed, many of the nation's major banks and financial services
companies, including Citibank, Wells Fargo and American Express
publicly stated last year that they would go a step further and offer
free electronic banking access.
     "It's really not about the financial institutions, it's really
about consumers and first making them aware and giving them a good
offer.  By good offer, I mean free," said Matt Lawlor, chairman and
chief executive officer of Online Resources and Communications Corp.,
McLean, Va. 
       Lawlor said pricing will be vital to consumer acceptance of
home banking.  Three pricing models are emerging, he said.  "If you
want the consumer in masses, then the pricing has to be down there. If
it's a bill payment then it ought to be down there where the cost of a
stamp is," Lawlor said. 
          Harold Spielman, chief executive officer of market researcher
McCollum Spielman Worldwide, Great Neck, N.Y., however, cautions
against euphoria over electronic banking. "This [electronic banking]
is one of those things where it seems to me its time for a piece of
good research on what people are actually doing or not doing.  It's
totally vague right now," Spielman said. 
      Catherine Corby, director of electronic delivery strategy for
Barnett Banks, Jacksonville, Fla., agreed that in 1996 banks will need
to show consumers how electronic banking will benefit them. 
    Telecommunications Research Inc., an Arlington, Va., researcher,
predicts that about 5 million U.S. subscribers will be banking online
by 2005. 
    A key issue to pushing electronic banking is deciding which
interactive services and software companies to partner with.  
     That presents a challenge for the banks since in the past they
have gone it alone when it came to innovation, ITA's Waldheim said.
      "One of the things that is very exciting about interactivity,
particularly interactive TV when it comes about, is that it will be up
to the cable company or the telephone or the platform to market the
bank to a certain degree. It's in their interest that banks on their
platforms are successful," Waldheim said.
     Security of accounts and transactions remains an issue, but many
industry officials believe that is easily and ultimately solvable
through marketing since consumers typically have confidence in their
financial institutions. 
    " As the banks move forward, they have systems to address the
security issues," Online Resources' Lawlor said. "What the consumer
will get is the confidence of their institution."

SKEPTICS OF ELECTRONIC BANKING WERE MORE RECEPTIVE LAST YEAR

    As director of electronic delivery strategy for Barnett Banks,
Florida's largest banking company, Catherine Corby spearheaded the
Jacksonville-based institution's recent inclusion in Time Warner
Cable's interactive television trial, Full Service Network, in
Orlando.
    In an interview with Interactive Video News Editor Marvin Greene,
Corby takes issue with electronic banking models proffered by software
companies and says financial institutions need to put the technology
on consumers' front burners.

IVN: What was 1995 like for electronic banking, and what's ahead for
this year?  

Corby: I think the skeptics were finally driven into seclusion [in
1995]. The key for really breaking out for the consumer is when we are
really using our PCs to receive mail.  Not just turning the PC on once
every two weeks, but having it become a vital part of our lives. 
     At the point that merchants can deliver bills electronically to
consumers on their PCs that are integrated with their financial
services programs or interactive services that they're working on, at
that point I think home banking will be prevalent.  Until then, I
think it's going to take customers with patience who are willing to
get around or overlook some of the shortcomings with the current
services, or institutions that simply don't overpromise what they
can't deliver.
     What I've learned from consumers after working with interactive
services for 15 years in the financial services world is if you do a
poor implementation of a technology, you set that opportunity back
several years because consumers have long memories about what didn't
work.  And it's hard to convince them it's better now.

IVN: Explain how electronic banking is going to work on the Full
Service Network in Orlando with Time Warner.

Corby: What we've tried to do is to create the same kind of an
environment that you have when you come into one of our current
banking stores, from the perspective that you learn about us, you
learn about our values, you learn about our products and services
through the merchandising that we do.
    When you come into our venue on the Full Service Network you will
be presented with the opportunity to walk around and browse as you
might in a store, or to go very quickly to the specific area where you
want to conduct a specific transaction.  We don't force you into one
mode or the other. The customer chooses...all in a virtual
environment. 

IVN: Your model of electronic banking differs from that of software
companies like Intuit and Microsoft?  What do you think of their
approach?

Corby:  If we keep going down the model that Intuit, for example, is
setting out, then the personal finance software becomes the heart of
the banking relationship.  And the information for any one financial
institution gets filled in.  In that environment, home banking becomes
defined as paying my bills, seeing my balances.  That is not a broad
electronic delivery service in the home.  That is a transaction
service.  
    For the financial institutions, if we go and accept that model and
don't challenge it and try to build more consumer value, then I think
we're going to be working ourselves into a very narrow place into the
home in the world of electronic commerce.  I think we have the chance
today, and that's why we got involved with Time Warner, to develop a
much more comprehensive service, one that really is an electronic
store.

IVN:  You have been quoted previously as saying home banking has to be
"engaging, informative and fun."  How do you make banking fun?  

Corby:  I think there are two ways you do it.  You take it just the way
retailers has managed to make shopping fun in stores while other
retailers have not paid any attention to it and have a totally
different market.  You can't make banking fun if it's looking at a PC
screen that has a bunch of account statements and numbers on it.
      But if you can create the store electronically and let people
browse, and go to what interests them and learn about you and your
institution through the electronic media, I think it's possible. The
other thing is you have to take all the clerical aspects of it away.

IVN:Do you think the television is a good medium for electronic
banking.

Corby:   I think the issue of TV or PC is irrelevant. Because the fact
is that      the TVs are becoming more like PCs and the PCs are
becoming more like TVs. What you need to think about is whether you're
talking about a 10-inch interaction or a 10-foot interaction, because
they are different things that take place in different rooms in the
home.  One involves group activity.  One involves more single
activity.  You have to think about it that way.
     I believe the 10-foot environment is a place where you can bring
financial services into the home. It's not necessarily where you're
going to sit down and do detailed financial management.  But that's
not what consumers do every time they think about doing banking. 
Sometimes they're curious and they want information. They're thinking
about, "Maybe I want to move to a new house and I wonder what's
involved."  
    If we can get ourselves positioned so that when they start thinking
about those kind of things, they think to turn to their financial
institution to learn. Then we're able to sell.

IVN:How big of a concern is security on electronic mediums for
consumers?

Corby:   I think it's a very big issue for consumers as well as for
financial institutions.  It's one that we're addressing. But it's a
huge issue and we're going to have to pay attention to it all along.

BELL LABS TOUTS VIDEO DEVICE

    Bell Laboratories says a 1969 invention, the charge-coupled device,
now used worldwide in solid-state video cameras, has become part of
the first panoramic viewer to provide a 360-degree live-action view
from a single vantage point.  The system can be used in a wide variety
of applications where other cameras cannot, such as movie theaters,
interactive TV, videoconferencing and home shopping.  It also could
provide panoramic surveillance in prisons, department stores, casinos
and day-care centers.   Unlike other panoramic viewers that use a
rotating lens or multiple cameras, the Bell device has no moving parts
and operates from a single vantage point, allowing it to be used for
both still pictures and full-motion video photography at all
distances.

CATV SERVICE GROWTH AHEAD 

    Paced by the upgrading of cable systems to offer telephony,
video-on-demand and interactive services like home shopping, U.S.
sales of cable TV-associated hardware and technology services will
grow from $1.78 billion in 1994 to $2.36 billion by the year 1999 at a
6 percent compound annual rate, projects a new Frost & Sullivan study.
In the study, "Profiles of CATV-Related Companies,"  services
including engineering, construction and network management will rise
from 10 percent of revenue in 1994 to 25 percent in 1999 and
transmission and distribution lines will increase from 15 percent to
24 percent. Competition will encourage cable operators to invest in
construction programs they otherwise might delay due to revenue losses
from rate reductions mandated by the FCC, the study said.

INTERNET SHAKEOUT PREDICTED

    Cable and telephone companies will create even more competition in
the increasingly crowded field of companies providing Internet access.
That will led to a shakeout of such providers, says a report by the
Yankee Group in Boston. There are more than 1,400 Internet service
providers to the corporate and consumer markets; Yankee predicts there
will be 60 providers by 1999.  "Most of the local `mom and pop'
operations and smaller regional providers will be crushed by their own
growth," said Greg Wester, Yankee research director.

ITV PROFITS EXPECTED IN 2001

    Ovum, a London-based market research company has issued the fourth
and final update to its report, "Interactive Television: the Market
Opportunity,"  which contains forecasts to 2005.  Principal report
author John Matthews said the United States will be the first area to
become "cash positive" in interactive TV, in 2001. In 2002, Europe is
forecast to make a profit on  capital investments.  The Asia-Pacific
region will not be profitable until 2005, the report said.  The United
States will have about 26.4 million households with cable access to
ITV by 2005, the report said.

TELECOM BILL DELAY STALLS INTERACTIVE INDUSTRY
Resolution of issues not likely until February

     Affordable technology and economies of scale have been the great
inhibitors to credible deployments of consumer interactive
applications.  Most industry observers point to the lack of investor
certainty in the legislative and regulatory climate as primary
culprits to the industry's stalled development.
     "The industry is waiting for Congress to provide the new rules
necessary in this new era of convergence," concedes Senate Commerce
Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-SD), the senator commissioned
with reforming the Communications Act of 1934 in the image of the
Republican Revolution. "And that is what we are trying to accomplish."
      Yet it appears that Congressional meddling has provided even
more uncertainty because of its inability to reach agreement among the
two chambers, with the communications industry, and with the White
House about how to pass a telecommunications regulation reform bill.
      The situation has been further exacerbated by the budget
impasse, which not only is preoccupying Congress and the White House
from completing legislation, but also is steadily deteriorating an
already contentious relationship between Congress and the White House.
       That contentious relationship between the legislative and
executive branches has resulted in constant changes to the bill
throughout the process as Republicans attempt to exert their
deregulatory vision of communications policy against constant veto
threats by the president.
        Regulatory attorneys have been taking advantage of the time
spent debating on legislation to provide their clients with the only
source of certainty.  "At least now we know how to manipulate the
system," jokes a Washington attorney who specializes in challenging
cable regulation.  
         The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) likewise has felt
the impact of the telecom legislation debacle, tentatively basing
regulatory decisions on the interpretation of legislative tea leaves,
yet unwilling to commit itself for fear of alienating a Congress that
has threatened its very existence.
       Investors, however, want to know that if they invest in new
interactive technologies and new applications, communications
attorneys representing potential competitors will not cause delay.
      "Most technology-driven cable companies and interactive
application start-ups are severely undervalued right now," says Philip
Getter, vice president of investment broker Josephthal Lyons & Ross,
New York.  "Investors are skittish about committing money to an
industry with an uncertain regulatory future."
       The answer, investors and industry players agree, is a quick
resolution to Congressional efforts at completing telecommunications
regulation reform.  "The potential benefits of this bill to the
interactive, multimedia, and entire communications industry is mind-
boggling," says House Telecommunications Subcommittee Chairman Jack
Fields (R-Texas).  
       With a completed bill, investors would get their certainty,
lawyers will still have work to do during the transition, start-ups
will have access to more capital necessary for interactive
applications, and consumers will receive a litany of choices to
communication providers, most of which will use interactive
application to differentiate their value.
       Currently, a conference committee report, dated Dec. 22, 1995,
is being circulated around the Hill awaiting signatures from
conference participants to buoy support in preparation for a vote in
both chambers.  
       In that conference report, the cable industry would be freed
from pricing regulation three years after the enactment of the bill,
unless they face "demonstrable and effective" competition, in which
case they could expect immediate relief upon FCC approval.
    The hold up, however, is on the liberalization of foreign ownership
restrictions and cyberporn regulation.  Advanced TV spectrum policy --
whether to auction it or provide it for free to incumbent broadcasters
also is an issue of substantial contention that drew comment from
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS). The Clinton administration claims
that the auction of broadcast spectrum could garner $50 billion for
the U.S. Treasury, a "hysterical" estimate, according to Republican
staffers. 
        Congress and the White House have until Feb. 20 to resolve the
issues, though, as the Senate will not consider any unscheduled votes
until then.  Although the House has looser rules about votes this
session, the less disciplined bunch has more Republican Revolution-
oriented issues to take up while the Senate gets its schedule in
order.
        Many observers consider the cable provision, though, the most
important for the interactive industry because the cable industry is
most likely to pursue the more complex consumer applications.

EURO HDTV SOON TO BE A REALITY?

The United Kingdom has finally backed down and
reached an agreement with its other European partners
over a high definition television strategy for
Europe.

After over three years of wrangling and debate, a
united EC stance has now been made leading to the
possible development of a HDTV standard in the future
(Satnews passim).  A meeting of the EC
Telecommunications Ministers agreed upon a GBP160
million subsidy and the rights for broadcasters to
choose the most advanced broadcast technology
available.  The Council of the EC has now accepted
the 'Action Plan' produced by the telecomms
ministers.

The UK had consistently objected to the GBP700
million subsidy plans raised by community members and
the backing of D2-MAC as the transmission standard on
the grounds that the technology could soon be
superceded by digital HDTV services and that the
imposition of a standard was protecting businesses
rather than the consumers.

Patrick McLoughlin, the newly appointed trade and
technology minister, said after the meeting on 16
June: "European companies can now be at the cutting
edge of this technology and UK providers will be well
placed to take advantage because of their expertise
and experience."

McLoughlin replaced Edward Leigh in an internal
government reshuffle. Leigh caused a May meeting of
ministers to stop making a critical decision on the
future of Euro HDTV after he left early to attend the
launch of Astra 1C.

"This is an excellent outcome for Europe and UK
industry and consumers.  After three years of hard
negotiation we now have a realistic and forward
looking action plan for the development of the coming
generations of TV technology," said McLoughlin.

Commissioner Martin Bangemann said that the funding
would be used to introduce widescreen HDTV television
programme production, transmission and marketing, but
it would be available on a co-financing basis.
Participating companies will have to find at least 50
percent of the total sum required before applying for
an EC subsidy.   Community funding will be phased out
on a sliding scale as time goes on.

"Early entrants in both the developed and less
developed markets will qualify for maximum support
because they accept the highest risks.  Those
undertaking HDTV will also receive a special quality
premium for the same reason," said the EC statement.

IBM 'FINALLY' ANNOUNCES EURO SATCOMMS SERVICE

IBM has finally announced the official existence of
its IN Satconnect service in Europe, much to the
chagrin of the other satellite network operators who
are keeping a somewhat discrete silence over the
whole affair, reports Data Broadcasting News, the
sister publication to Satnews.

After many months of waiting and broken internal
deadlines, IBM executives have allowed news of the
new service to become officially released.  Many
software revisions and internal quality assurance
certifications contributed towards the internal
delays.  Many observers who have seen the system
believe that the IBM-induced delays were worthwhile.

The system has been announced in Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland and the UK.

Data transmission rates of 9.6kbit/s to 2mbit/s can
be attained through the new 'digital pipe'.  The
"general availability" date is slated for 30
September 1993.  Countries will be free to set their
own dates.

Typically IBM expects one bit in two billion (10 to
the power of 10) to be corrupted at the downlink.
Error correction significantly reduces this
occupance.

IN SatConnect is designed to be operated
independently of other telecommunications networks,
although it can be linked with the existing IBM
Information Network services like the IBM Information
Exchange EDI service to collect data. With the
system, the information provider will link into IBM's
network to transmit data for distribution. Receive
sites will use conventional VSAT hardware combined
with IBM PCs and custom-designed hardware. VSAT
receivers as small as 80cm can be used in the centre
of the Eutelsat satellite's footprint.

Signal security is a key feature of IN SatConnect,
and advanced data masking technology has been
included to provide integrity for transmitted data.
As the system is digitally-based, video, audio and
data can be merged and transmitted securely.

Data can be scheduled so that it is broadcast at a
set time even though it has been loaded by the
information provider onto the transmission system in
advance. Real time data throughput will be supported
on the system during 1994 once a second release of
software is made during December 1993.  IBM is
presently attempting to attract "batch broadcasters"
who wish to send large files to multiple locations
rather than the continuous small-file feed companies.

Real time feeds are considered an important business
area and they will be approached once a steady stream
of customers has been found.

The information provider is charged for connection to
the SatConnect service. There is an initial charge of
GBP3,552 and an annual charge of GBP13,331 for the
transfer of 500 megabytes of data.  Further use is
charged according to a tariff.  Receive sites cost
GBP1,068 initially with a GBP720 annual charge
thereafter.  Under the existing IBM discount scheme,
existing IN users can achieve discounts up to 40
percent of standard tariff guides, bringing the costs
down significantly in the process.

Individual per-megabyte charges will be GBP12.40
after the initial 500 megabyte threshold has been
passed.

IBM has signed an agreement with Comstream Corp. to
market and distribute its satellite receiver
equipment.  Although IBM is not making the use of
Comstream equipment mandatory, thus allowing the
potential use of plug-compatible equipment, Comstream
equipment will be marketed as a "complimentary non-
IBM product" and will feature in all promotional and
sales literature.

The Comstream DBR401 multi-function satellite
broadcast receiver and LNB are provided under the
marketing agreement.

One feature of the IBM network is that bandwidth can
be changed "over the air" in accordance with users'
needs.  The DBR401 receiver will have four pre-
selected data rates programmed as standard reducing
the requirement for field maintenance.

Data sent to the receiving PS/2 computer can
immediately be routed to a LAN server or mainframe if
required, thus freeing local receiver resources and
permitting the prompt processing of data.

* Minimum system requirements for the PS/2 receiver
are: MCA-based bus; 20MHz clock speed; 8MB RAM; slot
for IN card; RS-232 port; OS/2 version 1.3 standard
edition or OS/2 version 2.0

IDB OPENS UK C-BAND EARTH STATION

IDB Communications Group has formally inaugurated
service to its 11-metre C-band earth station in the
United Kingdom.  The station, located at Brookman's
Park outside London, is the first privately-owned C-
band uplink in the UK and the first IDB owned and
operated facility outside of the US.

Brookman's Park is the location of a large array of
transmitting apparatus for the British Broadcasting
Corporation, the UK state broadcasting company.

The earth station will be utilised by IDB Worldcom,
the telecommunications arm of IDB, in cooperation
with the Russian Satellite Communications Company
(RSCC) to operate StatCom, a voice and data
communications service linking the US and other
European cities with the Russian Federation and CIS
countries.

A Russian Statsionar 5 satellite located at 53
degrees east longitude will be used to host the
service.  Customer premises equipment providing
connectivity to the network will comprise of
integrated 3.8 and 4.5 metre C-band earth stations.
StatCom has been running since May 1993 with a
temporary 7 metre antenna.

IDB hopes that emerging and isolated businesses, such
as the oil and gas companies, will find the service a
more viable and cost-effective method of
communications compared to present-day alternatives,
such as the Inmarsat system.

Edward Cheramy, president of IDB, said: "The oil and
gas industry is expected to spend over US$20 billion
in the next decade, developing oil and gas fields in
the Russian Federation and the newly independent
states.  It is estimated that telecommunications
expenditures will surpass US$300 million during that
time period.  IDB and RSCC are well positioned to
serve these major telecommunications requirements."

* RSCC is a state enterprise of the Russian
Federation Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.

EC TO ADOPT COMMON APPROACH ON EARTH STATIONS

A recent meeting of the Telecommunications Council of
the European Community has passed a draft directive
aimed at creating a single market for satellite earth
station equipment.

If approved, the directive will assist the
manufacturers of satellite communications equipment
achieve the economies of scale necessary to compete
effectively in European and world markets.

The directive, COM(92)451, would extend the ruling of
directive 91/263/EEC on telecommunications terminal
equipment to include the harmonised certification and
testing of equipment and to guarantee the use of
approved satellite communications in all member
countries.

"The development of satellite communication has been
up to now held back by the fragmentation of the
Community market, in contrast to the situation in the
US where this technology is more widespread," said an
EC statement.

INTEGRATED INMARSAT-M TERMINAL LAUNCHED

ABB Nera has launched a new integrated satellite
telephone system that utilises Inmarsat's newest
Inmarsat-M personal communications standard.

The new offering, known as Saturn Mp, is being aimed
initially at journalists and other world travellers
who require voice and data communications services
often where terrestrial alternatives do not exist.

Saturn uses Inmarsat-M, a new digital satellite
communications standard that has enabled significant
call tariff reductions and reductions on the size of
transmitting and receiving apparatus.  The unit
weighs a total of 9kg and measures 405 x 290 x 120mm,
and is encapsulated in a lockable briefcase.  The
antenna and RF electronics are integrated into the
briefcase's lid.

"The media often find themselves in parts of the
world where conventional communications systems are
frustratingly poor or simply do not exist.  The
Saturn Mp provides them with an instant method of
communication from virtually anywhere in the world,"
said Martyn Braime, managing director of ABB Nera.

ABB already produces a range of communications
equipment for land and marine use, and the latest
product will help complement its existing portfolio
says the company.  ABB also claims to be the UK's
largest supplier of satellite equipment for use on
the Inmarsat system.

"SECURE" VIDEOCRYPT HACKED --CLAIM

Videocrypt, the ever-powerful video encryption system
marketed by News Datacom has been hacked, according
to top signals piracy specialist John McCormac.

There have been many hacks on the Videocrypt system,
but McCormac says that the present one is the most
damaging to date, and it addresses key flaws in the
security system.  It has been tested by McCormac and
confirmed to decode all Videocrypt channels.

Quaintly named as "Ho Lee Fook", the piracy work is
claimed to be based within Central Europe.  The hack
works by effectively acting as a super Videocrypt
smart card, giving unlimited access to channels.

"The card is approximately 16 millimetres longer than
the official Sky card. It is a blue printed circuit
with a single surface mount chip and five connector
pads," said McCormac, explaining that unlike other
hacks, this one does not use a wafer from a usual
legitimate card, but is instead a specially-
engineered chip.

During a period of testing no "kill" messages were
sent to the card, shutting off service to the BSkyB
channels.  McCormac speculates that a filter may have
been added telling the on-board circuitry to ignore
kill or disable messages sent within the Videocrypt
datastream.

Commercially, the hack may be renamed SVA1000, but
like many things in the hacking marketplace, things
can change on a daily basis. Commercial piracy
marketers will incorporate the HLF hack within
existing decoders, and a price point of GBP99 has
been mentioned in some circles.

Due to UK legislation, it would be an offence for
Satnews to give details of the marketing source in a
UK-published publication.  There are reports that one
UK publisher may face prosecution after giving out
the telephone number of Megasat Germany, a purported
supplier for the decoders, on a 0898 premium rate
telephone line.

TCI TURNS EAST FOR CABLE

Telecommunications Inc., the world's largest cable
television operator, is looking East with the
investment in Cable Soft Network, a supplier of cable
TV programmes to Japan's 160 cable TV operators.

The investment, worth around US$2.8 million, follows
on from investments made by rivals Time Warner
Entertainment into Japanese cable television
operating companies.

When compared to the US marketplace, the Japanese
market for cable television services is quite
immature.   Over ten million people nationwide tune
into US cable systems, compared to 700,000 people
tuning into Japanese services.  Japanese industry
forecasters expect this figure to rise to over one
million households by the end of 1994.

EURO-TURNER STARTS, NTL UPLINKS

Turner Broadcasting Systems says that TNT and The
Cartoon Network, its two new European distributed
television services, will commence operations on 17
September 1993 aboard the Astra 1C satellite.

And National Transcommunications Limited (NTL) has
been awarded a five-year contract to uplink the two
channels.  The channels will be originated and played
out at Chrysalis Television Facilities in London and
uplinked from NTL in Winchester.

Alastair Hamilton, director of satellite systems for
Turner International, said: "After careful
consideration of all the uplink proposals, we felt
that NTL offered us the best technical solution, and
in a timeframe commensurate with our launch plans for
the new network."

NTL is noting an upturn in demand for satellite
uplinking services, and it is presently building a
new teleport at Winchester to cater with forecast
demand.  A digital pipeline will be serviced to
London to carry programming sourced by broadcasters
using London either as an origination point or a feed
point through the BT tower.

NTL already has an uplink location in Croydon near
London and in central London on the Chrysalis
Television building. It also services occasional use
clients through its Rapido flyaway terminals.

Initially two 8-metre uplinks have been installed,
although an 11 metre and an 13 metre antenna are
planned.  NTL believes that its Winchester location
is particularly well suited for uplinking because of
the relative RF-free environment.

"NTL is uniquely positioned to provide uplinking to
Astra 1C from our teleport near Winchester," said
John Okas, business development director at NTL.  "We
are delighted to be serving Turner International and
we expect to sign other contracts shortly.  NTL is
now an established force in satellite broadcasting
and providing real competition to BT."

CAMBRIDGE CONFIDENT OF EXPORT BOOM

Cambridge Industries, formerly Cambridge Computer, is
confident that its 1993 export sales will be better
than previous years because of its new ARX200
receiver.   The receiver was launched at Cable &
Satellite '93, and significant interest was shown by
dealers present at the launch.

Alan Oxley, export sales manager for Cambridge, says
that the new product has especially been welcomed by
multi-lingual customers because it can easily receive
transmissions from different satellites, with a
number of decoders being connected into the receiver.

"In Mainland Europe, Astra and Telecom [band] twin
systems are becoming more popular.  We predict demand
will be high enough to introduce a twin LNB input
version of the ARX200 by September, to simplify
installation and remove the need for a switchbox,"
said Oxley.

THREE-FOLD EXPANSION SET FOR EURO DMX SYSTEM

International Cablecasting Technologies -- ICT Europe
-- says that they are expanding their 30-channel
digital music delivery service to 86 channels only
months after the network's European launch.   The new
service will make DMX the largest delivery route for
continuous music presently available.

Jerold Rubinstein, chairman and CEO of ICT in the US,
said that the new enhancement would retain the
company's competitive edge and enable it to give
European cable network operators a greater level of
flexibility in the customisation of channel offerings
in accordance to local tastes or network
restrictions.

Initially the system will be increased from 30 to 60
channels by October 1993, and this will in turn be
increased to 86 channels by the end of 1993.

Included in the new European channel line-up are
specialised international formats such as World Beat,
Flemish Music, Irish Folk, Hebrew Traditional and
Indian programming.

"At DMX we are, and always will be, a music
programming service.  As we move forward into
narrowcasting and niche programming, we reaffirm our
vision of DMX as a music service dedicated to
offering subscribers more choice, more variety and
more of the music they want," stated Rubinstein.

The new channels to be carried on ICT Europe's DMX
service are: German (Easy Listening, Oldies/Schlager,
Folk, Hits & Rock); French (Chansons/Easy Listening,
Hits, Oldies & Chanteuses); Dutch (Easy Listening,
Hits, Dutch Mix, Flemish Mix, Oldies & Childrens);
Irish (Folk); Swiss (Folk); Spanish (Flamenco);
Nordic (Swedish, Norwegian and Danish); Israeli
(Hebrew Hits, Hebrew Traditional); Italian
(Traditional); Russian (Hits) and Ethnic (Indian,
Turkish & Oriental (Eastern Mediterranean).

Satnews has requested an evaluation model of DMX from
ICT and will provide a full review for subscribers
once it has been received and evaluated.

At the National Cable Television Association show in
San Francisco, ICT unveiled DMX Select, a 'music
library in the sky' which offers virtually limitless
digital audio programming options to the cable
television operator.  With the new system, operators
will be able to customise the DMX offering.  Some
cable systems will not be able to distribute the
additional music channels planned by DMX, and the DMX
Select unit will enable them to mix and match
channels to form a composite output.

SETTLEMENT OVER INTELSAT LAW SUIT LIKELY

A litigious law suit between Intelsat and Martin
Marietta has reached a tentative settlement over the
controversial launch of Intelsat 603, a satellite
stranded in low orbit that had to be recovered by US
Space Shuttle astronauts.

A joint statement by the two parties said that the
companies had negotiated terms to settle the
litigation.

Martin Marietta sued Intelsat, seeking relief from
future damages claims. Intelsat counter-sued for the
value of the satellite, lost revenue, and recovery
costs for the satellite.  The satellite has now been
relaunched and is operating successfully.  Martin
Marietta admitted that its Titan rocket failed to
launch the satellite, but pointed out that Intelsat
had 'self insured' and agreed to fund all losses in
the event of a claim.

A US District Court hearing had preliminary came down
in favour of Martin Marietta, although a federal
appeals court sent the decision back to the lower
court, saying that it should look whether Martin
Marietta had made its best effort to launch the
satellite.

The companies have agreed on terms to settle the suit
and agreement from the Intelsat board of directors,
set to meet in September, is now required.  The
companies are remaining tight-lipped over the other
conditions and terms.

Intelsat previously contracted with GE Astrospace to
purchase two satellites. In April, Martin Marietta
purchased GE Astrospace's parent company, making it
fighting against a company it was doing business
with.

Some industry sources say that the agreement is
likely to be based on Martin Marietta honouring the
GE Astrospace contracts with a significant discount
plan.

CIT UNVEILS NINTH ANNUAL SATCOMMS REPORT

The London-based research organisation CIT Research
has launched its ninth annual report into Satellite
Communications in Europe.  The 1993 report analyses
the changes that have been made in the European
marketplace over the past year, and forecasts how
they will change over the short to medium term.

During 1992 satellite carriers (such as Eutelsat,
Inmarsat and PanAmSat) earned ECU835 million from
European operations, with broadcast television
accounting for 55 percent of revenues.  Business
services accounted for 14 percent and telephony for
31 percent of revenues.  Eutelsat was the dominant
carrier, closely followed by Intelsat and SES, owners
of the Astra satellite.

CIT says that Astra has managed to get the reputation
of being a "hot bird" for European television
distribution (DTH), much to the dismay of Eutelsat,
and SES revenues are likely to be ECU220 million in
2002, compared to ECU270 million for Eutelsat.

Clearly Eutelsat's perceived dominance will fall with
SES' rises.

By the close of 1992, CIT estimated that there were
around 6.7 million DTH terminals in Europe, with the
UK and Germany responsible for 77 percent of the
share.   Low cable penetration (and take up) and
strong programming markets were cited as drivers for
this demand.

In Eastern Europe, CIT believes that there are around
800,000 DTH terminals installed, with 44 percent of
these in Poland.  Consumer weakness in the former
Eastern European countries is seen as a barrier for
the introduction of cable television networks or
premium programming.  Instead, viewers are likely to
tune into free satellite delivered programming,
maximising their resources after purchasing a
satellite receiver system.

Digital compression of signals is also set to pose
some benefits to European broadcasters and viewers
says CIT.  "The arrival of digital compression will
eventually radically change the structure of the
satellite TV marketplace, although CIT feels the
change will not be as fast as many insist," says the
report.

BSKYB AND QVC FORM EURO SHOPPING NETWORK

British Sky Broadcasting and QVC Inc. have joined
forces to launch a 24-hour service headed live from
London from 1 October. The service would be carried
on the Astra 1C satellite.

The new alliance was formed at the National Cable
Television Association exhibition.

Barry Diller, chairman of QVC said: "I could not be
more pleased to form a partnership with BSkyB to
bring home shopping to the UK and beyond."

Diller believes that the UK has great potential for a
teleshopping success, and that it would not face
adverse competition from existing teleshopping
companies.

Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp and British Sky
Broadcasting, said: "We are amazed at the growth of
direct selling by television and think this will add
a new dimension to BSkyB."

Spain and Portugal will not be covered by the BSkyB
venture, as they are being handled through a deal
with Grupo Televisa, signed in April, which will
provide a Spanish language service for Brazil, Mexico
and Spain.

CONFUSION OVER C-SMATV LICENCE REQUIREMENT

A ruling by the US Supreme Court says that federal
regulation of the cable television industry extends
to satellite systems that serve apartment buildings
with more than one owner, even though no public
access right of way is used.

The ruling reverses a federal appeal court ruling
which said that such communal systems were exempt
from regulations.

Under the 1984 Federal Cable Communications Policy
Act, a franchise is required by operators who provide
service over a cable system, but an exemption was
made for operators who "..serve only subscribers in
one or more multiple unit dwelling under common
ownership, control or management" when no public
right-of-way access (such as a street or pole) is
used.  The common instance of this exemption is where
the owner of an apartment installs a satellite dish
on the roof and installs a distribution circuit into
individual apartments.

The latest ruling upholds the opinion of the Federal
Communications Commission.

the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative, an
organisation set to up to increase television choice
in rural areas not served by conventional cable
networks.

The first DirecTV satellite is to be launched later
this year, with a second satellite a few months
later.  North American viewers signed up to the
system will be able to view up to 150 channels of
free, subscription and pay-per-view programming from
April 1994 using equipment manufactured by Thomson
Consumer Electronics and sold under the RCA branding.

BRIGHT FUTURE FOR ARIANESPACE SAYS BIGOT

Arianespace has clearly demonstrated its expertise in
the commercial space transport business over the past
five years, according to chairman Charles Bigot at
the recently Arianespace shareholders' general
meeting.

Since it began launching satellites, an average of
seven launches a year have been made by the company,
bringing in handsome revenues and rewards for the
company.  Bigot says that the success has been due to
regular and consistent operations, coupled with
commercial success that continues to consolidate
Arianespace's position as the "..world leader in its
business."

Announcing Arianespace's 1992 results, Bigot said
that total revenues were FFr4.85 billion, leading to
a FFr145.5 million net profit after charges.  A
FFr1.6 billion provision for technical and commercial
risks of launch has also been made.

In the last 18 months, Arianespace has booked 19 new
orders, helping consolidate its position in a
fiercely competitive marketplace.  Business in the
Asia-Pacific region has also been lucrative for the
company, who expect to make greater inroads into that
marketplace in the coming months.

Arianespace now has 40 satellites waiting to be
launched aboard its Ariane 4 launch rockets, worth
around FFr18 billion in revenues and contracts.

The company is slowly preparing to roll out its
Ariane 5 launcher and expects these to enter service
late in 1996.  Arianespace has signed a contact with
Societe Europeenne de Propulsion for Vulcan engines
which will be at the heart of the new systems.  A
three-year transition period will follow where Ariane
4 and Ariane 5 launchers are used according to launch
needs.

Many other companies, particularly those in the Far
East and former USSR, are looking at satellite
launching as a lucrative source of revenue.  Bigot
says that Arianespace believes that excessive
protectionism is not the best way to counter the
threat, but rather create structured competition
allowing the free-market forces to rule.

Arianespace recently signed a contract to launch an
Israeli Amos-1 telecommunications satellite in 1995.
The satellite, referred to as having military
applications, is being used for civilian purposes
says a spokesman for Arianespace.    Since 1988
Israel has launched two satellites into a low earth
orbit as part of a trial of a military communications
and reconnaissance network say observers.

FBI INVESTIGATES COURTROOM SNOOPING

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been joined into
an investigation by judges after a TV station allegedly
hid cameras throughout a courthouse in Cincinnati to see
whether court employees were loafing.

Judges at the Hamilton County Common Please Court ordered
the investigation after the allegations were levied
against WKRC-TV.

Presiding Judge Thomas Crush says that he was told by a
station reporter that the cameras had been installed to
monitor work output by county employees.

William Moll. president and general manager of the accused
station, said that the company would cooperate fully with
the investigation and that disciplinary action could not
be ruled out after the investigation is concluded.

The FBI was called in as US federal law prohibits the
electronic interception of others' communications when
they expect privacy.    Cameras were found after a search
of court rooms.

TALK SHOW CHANNEL LAUNCHED IN US

A new 24-hour talk show format cable television channel
has been launched, with the announcement made at the
National Cable Television Association conference and
exhibition.  Multimedia Entertainment will launch the
channel late in 1994.

Paul Fitzpatrick, former president of the Weather Channel,
will head up the new channel which is designed to offer
all new programming focusing on the major breaking news
topics of the day in a talk-show format.

Key interviewers and personalities will augment studio and
telephone participants.  The majority of new talk show
hosts used by the channel will be 'home grown' and
developed as the channel progresses.

Interaction from viewers is being seen as a key component
for the venture.  A database will be kept noting people's
interests, and should a topic suddenly become newsworthy
they will be called and their views and comments sought
for use on air.   Extensive use will also be made of
viewers' polls and opinions.

Multimedia Entertainment says that the launch of the
channel is the result of extensive research conducted over
several years that has highlighted a niche for the
channel.

"Cable operators will find The Talk Channel to be an
attractively priced alternative to some of the programming
options currently in the marketplace," said Fitzpatrick.

PANAMSAT INTRODUCES COMPRESSED VIDEO SERVICES

PanAmSat has recently started the operation of the world's
first commercial compressed digital video service for
multinational programming distribution.

A 24-hour CDV feed with MTV Latin America, Fox Latin
America, NBC Canal de Noticias, Cinecanal and TV5, was
initiated on behalf of programmers who wished to relay
services into the region.

Long-term agreements with broadcasters have been signed.
Programming is relayed by fibre to PanAmSat's Homestead,
Florida, USA uplink and operations centre before being
encoded and compressed using GI's DigiCipher 1000 Milti-
Channel Per Carrier product.

The use of DigiCipher enables six channels to be carried
in the same bandwidth formerly used by one analogue
signal.   By the end of the year, PanAmSat will be
distributing the CDV signals to around 500 cable headends
and wireless cable installations in Latin America for
rebroadcast.

"PanAmSat's success in Latin America has proven the need
for innovative satellite technology," said Fred Landman,
president of PanAmSat.  "Our reputation as the preferred
satellite in Latin America promoted demand we could not
keep up with.  By using compression, now we're once again
able to provide 24-hour broadcast distribution services on
PAS-1."

GENERAL DYNAMICS DISCOVER ROCKET FAILURE

General Dynamics Corp. say that a loose screw led to a 25
March malfunction of an unmanned Atlas rocket, whose
failure left a US Navy satellite in a useless orbit.  The
failure has now been corrected and will not hinder future
launches.

"General Dynamics believes, and the independent oversight
review board concurs, that it has taken a conservative and
prudent approach to the corrective action needed to return
Atlas to flight," said a statement issued by the company.

A US Navy satellite, manufactured by Hughes Aircraft,
entered a worthless orbit due to a malfunction stemming
from failure of a precision regulator in the Atlas
booster-engine power control subsystem, leaving it 3000
miles lower than a contractually required orbit of 9000
miles.

The failed launch could not have came at a worse time for
the company as it was the first of nine launches for the
US military in a three-year, US$1.6 billion programme.

Some industry analysts believe that the March failure will
make it hard for General Dynamics to win future business,
especially in the face of already stiff competition.

ADVERTISING FAILS TO MAKE MARK ON SATELLITE

In their thirst to maximise revenues, satellite
broadcasters are often failing to take into account the
needs of advertisers, instead concentrating on the
introduction of subscription services, a report published
recently claims.

Datamonitor published a report which says that revenue
from satellite advertising will contribute around 8
percent of all Europe-wide satellite channel revenues by
1997.  Advertising is set to account for US$761 million
(10 percent) in 1993.

The report says that by 1997, revenues from subscription
services will be worth US$16,500 million.  Datamonitor
cites a claim that many advertisers are feeling deprived
of valuable viewer penetration by the subscription
channels, or are being held to ransom for occasional
spots.

Many channels that do accept advertising are often
comparatively unwatched when compared to the blockbuster
subscription channels.

FCC DELAY TO COST CONSUMERS US$250 MILLION

A decision by the FCC to delay the enforcement of new
cable television regulations until 1 October will cost
consumers more than US$250 million in overcharging,
alleges a congressman and consumer advocate who backed the
legislation.

The FCC estimates that most cable companies are
overcharging customers by around US$1 billion per year in
total.

Republican Edward Markey, chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce telecommunications subcommittee and Gene
Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of America are
dismayed by the FCC's decision.

FCC Chairman James Quello says that the delay was due to
the lack of funding required to hire accountants and
attorneys to do the work demanded by the law.

"Going forward [with the legislation] at this time would
have resulted in mountains of complaints and certification
requests piling up at the commission, leading to chaos and
confusion among subscribers, cable operators and
franchising authorities, and resulting in numerous legal
challenges," said Quello.

MURDOCH MAKES BID FOR HK COMPANY

Rupert Murdoch has announced intent to purchase a 22
percent stake in the world's leading producer of Chinese
language television fare.

News Corp. has agreed to buy the stake of Television
Broadcasts Limited, although the deal is subject to
regulatory approval.  Sources say that the stake is worth
around US$237 million.

Foreign companies may not own more than 10 percent of a
Hong Kong television company without approval being
granted by the Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority, and a
stake of more than 15 percent cannot be held without full
government approval.

An application for approval has been received by the Hong
Kong government, and a decision is likely to take several
weeks.

A News Corp. spokesman, quoted in an article in the South
China Post, says that the company is confident of winning
government approval, yet it is prepared to fight if
necessary.

SPECIAL REPORT: CABLE IN THE HEARTLANDS
Satnews looks at the inroads cable television and
telephony has made into the Midlands region of the UK

Cable services across the Midlands are as diverse in style
and nature as the region itself. The heartland of Britain
is a centre of major development and innovation in the
cable business.

Twenty-three of the UK's cable franchises are located in
the Midlands. Not all are operating, but the region as a
whole is currently at the forefront in terms of cable
construction with seven major developments each having
more than 2,500 connections. Coventry Cable, which began
in 1985, is now one of Britain's few completely-built
systems (another is in Aberdeen, also owned by the Devanha
Group).

The Midlands region comprises three distinct conurbations
or groups of cities. Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, each
with active cable systems, form the backbone of the East
Midlands; to the West current cable activity centres on
the Birmingham/ Black Country conurbation and Coventry,
while development has yet to begin in the Potteries.
Annual cable investment in the region is currently
approaching GBP100m, with a total capital spend which will
eventually reach about GBP750m.

Many aspects of the cable business nationwide are
concentrated in the region: from telephony to specialist
programme services. Nearly a third of the Birmingham
system's subscribers use cable for their telephones, for
instance, and about half of the cabled homes in one
district of the city subscribe to TV Asia at GBP7.95 a
month.

The region, although large, in practice has cable
operators who are mostly independent from each other in
ownership. The only joint effort is the advertising sales
co-operative between Midlands Cable and Birmingham Cable.
Between them they could command a million homes - the two
largest franchises in the country.

The geographical diversity is complemented by a wide range
of potential subscribers from a notably multi-ethnic
audience. A quarter of the population of Leicester, for
instance, is of Asian origin. Fourteen per cent of people
living in Birmingham have Asian backgrounds, rising to 50
per cent in the Small Heath area. The next programming
opportunity in Birmingham is for its considerable Irish
population, though its 40,000 members are more
widely-spread than those of Asian origin.

Satellite receivers have taken their share of the
potential business of course, but Ted Campbell, Managing
Director of Birmingham Cable Limited, does not see them
outliving the arrival of cable services in an area: once,
that is, people have had dishes for a year or more and the
pain of paying for them has been blunted by time.

Sidney Bernstein was said to have chosen the North-West to
start Granada Television because he thought it was always
raining and people would stay indoors to watch television.
Ted Campbell says there are not all that many
opportunities for the mass of the scattered Midlands
population to find entertainment outside the home as might
be the case with the London entertainment circuit.

Subscribers are also responding well to the offer of
residential and business telephone lines, coupling a state
of the art network and locally based service with lower
tariffs. Birmingham Cable is now installing Northern
Telecom DMS 100 switches costing more than GBP5 million,
with a capacity of 73,000 lines. The company already has
almost 27,000 residential telephone connections, a third
of 3,000 potential business lines installed and about
2,000 telephone-only subscribers.

Eighty-three per cent of calls in Birmingham are local.
According to Ted Campbell, city-based operators find it
more profitable to use their own local lines instead of
those of BT or Mercury. In smaller towns, the proportion
of local to long-distance calls would be lower, thus
diminishing the benefits of self-drive telephony.

The other major franchise holder in the central Midlands
conurbation is based in Dudley. Midlands Cable, currently
completing a partnership agreement with Cox
Communications, covers Wolverhampton and the Black
Country, and by the end of March had passed 63,000 of the
potential 470,000 homes. It had made 11,917 connect ions -
a penetration of 19 per cent. Midlands' second franchise
is based on Telford with a potential 55,000 homes, 18,000
of them so far passed.

In the East Midlands, Gary Davis, Managing Director of
Nottingham-based Diamond Cable, thinks the region is so
cable-active because 'the Midlands has seemed to me very
progressive: ready to accept change and try new products.'

Diamond, owned by Alabama-based businessman Allan J
McDonald, has seven franchises which together represent
about 519,000 homes. Six of these are in the East
Midlands. Gary Davis was a communications lawyer in the US
who migrated into cable development. His wife Sandy Davis
is Customer Services Manager at Diamond Cable.

Telephony is the spearhead of Diamond's marketing. In
mid-April Diamond had 3,000 cable television subscribers,
4,400 residential telephone subscribers and 100 business
telephone subscribers. The company was the first in the UK
to have its own telephone exchange. Diamond Cable's 42
programme services include two text-based local services,
one of which is produced in association with Radio Trent,
the local independent station.

Martin Beard became General Manager at Coventry Cable
Television in January 1992 - three months after the
Devanha Group took over. Coventry were early starters in
cable, and the franchise area covers about 119,000 homes.
The company does not currently offer telephony, but
discussions are in hand about its development. Coventry
offers 29 channels, including its popular COLT (Coventry
Local Television) channel. This is still expanding its
output and plans to put out ten hours a week of
substantially local programmes during this summer

On the city's place in the cable market, Martin Beard
comments: 'Coventry is a good prospect for cable. It has
long traditions at the forefront of innovation.' With new
credit control policies in place, Coventry Cable is
looking for growth this year and believes it is on a good
footing to make that happen. It is marketing a positive
image, an increased level of customer satisfaction and
better programme product.

Alan Chaney became Chief Executive at Leicester
Communications Ltd in March, when SaskTel took over
control, although he had been associated with the
Leicester, Loughborough and Shepshed franchises since
1988. Although it is a minority share, Leicester
Communications remains the only UK cable company to have
local authority investment.

Construction was halted about a year after the start of
building, but is now resuming. The company has pushed up
its penetration rate in recent months to 27 per cent and
Alan Chaney predicts that it could rise to between 30 and
40 per cent.

It is now launching telephony in Leicester and hopes to be
offering it to some 3,000 homes by autumn. Chaney feels
that the telecommunications development will greatly
increase the system's marketing potential.

Leicester currently offers 34 channels, although the
system has potential for 55. Cable 7, Leicester's licensed
local channel, was launched last summer.   The Community
Channel Manager, Jenny Ludlam, now has about 100
volunteers providing ideas and programme input. The
channel transmits eight hours of local programming a week,
ranging from the care of pets and finding homes for them
to religion and reports of Leicester City Council
meetings.

One proud achievement of Derbyshire Cablevision, according
to General Manager Keith Tonge, is that in 18 months of
building more than 80 miles of cable, the company had
received only 12 complaints. 'Derby is one of the best
cable franchises to have. It has the benefits of being a
concentrated area to build in, but the city itself has not
suffered many of the inner urban social problems which
have been a feature of other cities,' said Keith Tonge.

Derby has a text channel giving out local information, but
the company's Community Liaison Officer, Rachel Turner,
has also been developing an interesting local project with
schools. Six Derby schools - three of which are already
cabled - are producing videos on environmental issues in
their areas. Derbyshire Cablevision plans to screen a
compilation tape when they are complete.

The outer edges of the Midlands region also have some of
the country's most interesting cable developments:
Northampton, with a massive 56 per cent of homes connected
from those passed, is involved in a transition from
narrowband to broadband; Milton Keynes, where virtually
everyone is connected to one of the oldest of the
industry's networks, is also being upgraded; and Swindon,
the first UK cable franchise which, by the end of March,
had risen to one of the country's highest ratios of homes
connected at 32.7 per cent.

As the man said, you have to speculate to accumulate. The
diversity of the Midlands has attracted many different
aspects of speculation. And accumulation - of both
connections and services - is now firmly in the category
of the pipeline rather than the pipe dream.

NEWS IN BRIEF

Following the announcement by US President Clinton that
the US was going to develop a modular space system derived
from the original "Freedom" concept, the director-general
of the European Space Agency, Mr Jean-Marie Luton, has
affirmed his satisfaction at the news and confirmed that
ESA will work together with NASA on development work for
the station.

NTL has won the Peter Wayne award for design and
innovation at the Montreux television symposium (ITS) for
its System 2000 video compression equipment.  The annual
award is presented in recognition of good design, quality,
technical excellence, value for money and innovation.
System 2000 enables four or more digital TV channels to be
transmitted on a carrier that would usually support one
analogue signal.

The Second European Space Agency Electronic Components
Conference was recently held at ESTEC in Noordwijk, the
Netherlands, and attended by over 300 specialists from 20
countries. The conference concluded that the market for
high reliability space components is rapidly changing,
that the complexity of electronic components used in space
programmes is increasing, that programmable integrated
circuits are needed in space programmes and that the
exchange of data and information regarding components in
space applications is necessary.

Satellite television equipment dealers Electrotech in the
UK have introduced a new GBP16 flat price service repair
charge for equipment returned, guaranteeing the goods to
be repaired and returned and replaced within 72 hours.
The offer applies to equipment produced by Maspro,
Echostar, Palcom, PACE, Amstrad, Panasonic, Nokia, Hitachi
and JVC.

Cambridge Cable Limited, the cable television franchise
operator in the UK, is now offering free installation of
telephone service even if customers do not subscribe to
its cable television service.  The company hopes to
attract customers who do not require extra television
channels but wish to make considerable call savings over
BT and Mercury Communications.

Muzak has signed a multi-year contract worth US$2 million
with Antex Electronics Corp. for a new satellite
downloadable message system.  The digital system allows
the recording and playback of digitized audio messages and
schedules for use within retail shopping organisations.

Funding for BBC World Service Television should be taken
out of the hands of the UK government's Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, said shadow Heritage Secretary Ann
Clwyd at a recent lobby aimed at defending broadcasting
institutions.  WS is likely to make severe cuts after
being advised of budget cutbacks by the FCO.  Clwyd said
that the WS was one of the UK's best ambassadors and that
it should not face such financial restrictions.  BBC WSTV
is not affected by the planned cutbacks.

Hughes Communications Inc. and IDB Broadcast have signed a
long-term transponder lease aboard Galaxy 1R.   IDB will
market digitally compressed transmission services aboard
the transponder, and it already has its first customer
with Action Pay-Per-View, a 24-hour programmer of action
and adventure movies.  The C-band service will be aimed
primarily at cable network operators.

Digital Cable Radio in the US has expanded its service to
offer 57 channels of music programming.  One new channel
includes a news and information service as well as a
background music service aimed at businesses.  DCR is also
continuing to provide digital audio simulcasts of basic
cable TV channels such as HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, VH-1 and
MTV.  DCR has also signed an agreement with Time Warner
Cable to roll the service out to around 825,000
subscribers this summer.

A strike by television language dubbers in Spain is likely
to leave viewers lost for words.  Spanish viewers tune in
avidly to dubbed foreign programming, but a strike by
around 1100 dubbers seeking a uniform pay scale since 24
May means that TV operators have run out of dubbed
programmes in Spanish and Catalan.  Non-union dubbers are
being drafted in to ease the situation, but many
programmes are still not being dubbed.  The union is
urging viewers to complain to the TV networks.

There have been reports of interference caused by Astra 1C
to Eutelsat II F3 (16 degrees east longitude) on receive
dishes less than 90cm.  Although the Astra 1C satellite
has yet to complete testing and enter service, some
interference has been noted on 'common' transponders.  SES
and Eutelsat are actively monitoring the situation.

Hughes Communications Inc. and General Communications Inc.
have signed an agreement to extend GCI's long-term
transponder lease on Hughes' SBS 5 satellite until the end
of its life, presently estimated to be late 1999.   The
Ku-band transponder will be used to continue the provision
of network services through VSAT terminals.

IDB Communications's IDB Mobile Communications subsidiary
has signed a two-year Inmarsat-A service distribution
agreement with Sea Link Limited, whereby Sea Link will
coordinate mobile satellite voice, fax and data
communications services to Canadian and other
international users.  The global service will be provided
through IDB earth stations in California and New York, US
and Gnangara, Australia.

The European Commission is reviewing plans by Itochu
Corp., Mitsui & Co., Sumitomo Corp. and Nissho Iwai Corp.
to set up a joint venture in Europe to market satellite
communications equipment.   The EC has until the end of
June to review the proposal and to decide whether it will
have an impact on the existing marketplace.  If approved,
the companies plan to merge their business interests into
a new company called Newco.

A study by the University of Pennsylvania's Anneberg
School of Communications says that US television remains
largely white, male, middle-class and not middle age.
George Gerbner, dean emeritus of Annenberg, said that the
School studied 10 years of prime time television shows,
nine years of Saturday morning programming, various cable
shows, a week of daytime television and game shows and a
week of TV news.  Gerbner said that the average US home
watches TV for around seven hours daily and television
'seems to be frozen in a time-warp of obsolete and
damaging representations.'

Countdown has began for the launch of Arianespace flight
57, which will see the launch of Galaxy IV into a
geostationary orbit.  The launch, from the Kourou space
centre in French Guiana, is set for early  24 June.  At
the time of going to press there were no delays on the
launch schedule.

Telecommunications Inc., the largest cable television
company in the US, says that over half the television
stations on its systems have agreed not to charge it fees
to retransmit its programming, an action brought around by
the new Federal Cable Law.  Many operators are working
with TCI to create new ventures and regional activities by
means of complimentary recompense.

IDB Communications Group Inc. is planning to offer US$150
million of convertible subordinated notes due in 2003 in a
bid to raise additional funds, said a registration
statement filed to the US Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Jean-Claude Jumel, a soundman for the French TF1
television station has been killed by a sniper while
covering the fighting in Mogadishu. A driver for France-2,
a rival station for TF1, was killed the previous day in a
similar incident.

The Taiwanese Economics Ministry has signed a letter of
intent to participate in the US$4 billion Iridium global
satellite communications project headed by Motorola Inc.
The Ministry filed the letter of intent on behalf of
Pacific Electric Wire and Cable, who plans to invest US$80
million into the venture.

An executive of one of the Italian media mogul Silvio
Berlusconi's companies has been arrested on suspicion of
corruption. The arrest follows a large purge of corruption
in Italian government and business society.  Aldo
Brancher, assistant for special projects at Fininvest
Comunicazioni has been held on alleged suspicion of
channelling funds to political parties.  Berlusconi has
already been interviewed as part of the investigation.

Cable television operators in India will have to
retransmit oat least one Doordarshan (state-owned)
television channel of their choice and conform to
programme and advertisement transmission codes under new
lows formulated by the Indian government.

Preparations are underway at the Indian Space Research
Organisation for the launch of the Indian-developed Polar
Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) in the second week of
August.

SES are to interrupt transmissions to the Astra satellites
for half an hour on 23 July and 22 October for routine
maintenance purposes.  The outages will take place from
0315-0345 UTC on the two occasions.

Inmarsat has finalised the running order for its Second
International Conference and Exhibition on Mobile
Satellite Communications, set to be held in Paris, France
during October 1993.  Over 140 speakers from around the
world will participate in the conference.

Nickelodeon, the new BSkyB/Viacom backed children's
entertainment channel destined for life on Astra 1C will
commence transmissions with Videocrypt encoding on 1
September says the company.

ESPN, the US sports network, is planning to launch a
second channel on 2 November. ESPN2 will carry coverage of
college basketball, NHL, autoracing and US football.  ESPN
is also looking at transmitting the signal
internationally, and are holding talks with prospective
international partners.
 `
Sources say that National Cash Registers (NCR) is looking
to introduce a European-wide business television network
that will supplement its existing video conferencing
links. NCR is a large user of business television
resources in the US.

Intelsat has appointed Donald Wear Jr as General Counsel,
the principal legal officer for the organisation.  Wear
has an extensive media legal background and currently has
his own practice.

Steven Cooper has been appointed as Sales Manager for
Europe of Echosphere International.  Cooper worked for a
number of communications-related companies for some time
before joining the company as a regional sales executive.

Hong Kong-based Star TV has signed a distribution and
operating agreement to serve households in Malaysia,
Thailand and Egypt, as well as opening eight regional
offices in Asia. An operating agreement for Sri Lanka will
shortly be signed.

Northern Telecom Europe has received a multi-million pound
contract for the provision of Synchronous Digital
Hierarchy (SDH) equipment by Encom, a UK cable TV
operator, which will be used to provide advanced network
communications services to customers and the company at
large.

A US federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit claiming that
television stations repeatedly aired a 90-second video of
Rodney King's beating by LA police without permission from
the original videographer.  The judge ruled that George
Holliday did not have sole rights to the home video as
other networks had the right to air it because of its
social impact.

Rohde & Schwarz has introduced its SWVF TV Network
Analyzer which can be used as a network analyzer,
intermodulation analyzer, spectrum analyzer and sync and
pulse test signal generator. The product is available from
R&S stockists.

A US television programme featuring nude bible readings
was pulled off a public access cable system in Thurston
County, USA.    The programme was not pulled off the air
because of its content, but because police asked for a
temporary suspension to the programme because of a death
threat against the preacher.

According to reports from the Russian Space Ministry, A
Russian communications satellite has been lost in a low
orbit after the booster rocket apparently ran out of fuel.
The Horizont satellite, launched from Kazakhstan, is
effectively useless because of the failing of the Proton
rocket.

The European Commission has rejected the first of Norway's
membership demands [to the EC] after it wanted to ban
cable television networks from advertising for alcohol.
The EC believes that its existing regulations are already
quite stringent.

Speculation is mounting over ASDA, a UK national food
retailer, following claims that it is dropping the use of
In Store Radio Limited, a Norsat subsidiary, for Radio
Retailing.  A Norsat source says that the move will be
made on 1 July.

Turner Broadcasting has confired that it will develop two

NORTH AMERICAN SIGHTINGS
By Robert Smathers

The Galaxy 4 launch scheduled for June 9 was delayed.  The
cause  of the delay was a possible electronic abnormality
in the launch  vehicle.  As of this submission, no new
date for the launch has  been set, but the launch was
expected to be tried again in one to  two weeks.

The Caribbean Super Station has moved transponders
recently.  They used to be seen on Galaxy 6/22, but now
they are on Galaxy  7/22.  CSS is a occasional video
service, usually seen in the  evenings a few days a week.

NHK Japan has moved transponders on Galaxy 6.  They used
to be on  Galaxy 6/18 but now they are on Galaxy 6/22.
This NHK Japan  channel is the circuit from New York to
Tokyo.

The CBS Television Network Contract Channel on Galaxy 6/7
has  appeared more often as of late.  Usually only feeds
to the network have appeared, but recently there has been
a slate announcing G6/7 as CBS TV and that slate has been
up quite often.  It is expected that the CBS Television
Network will occupy Galaxy  6 and then "hot-switch" onto
Galaxy 4 when G4 is launched and  becomes operational.

SATELLITE TV EVENT OF THE WEEK:  The main event this week
was the  United States military action in Mogadishu,
Somalia.  The  military bombed and destroyed some
strategic targets of a warlord.  Coverage was found on the
newsfeeds of the networks as  well as an occasional feed
on Telstar 301, Telstar 302, Galaxy 6,  or Galaxy 7.  I
assume the majority of the coverage of this  military
action was found on the Atlantic satellites where all  the
major networks have their contract channels on an Intelsat
to  carry coverage from Europe/Africa back to the United
States.

UK:  DECISION DUE ON MGN BID

The directors of Newspaper Publishing, owner of the `Independent' and
`Independent on Sunday', may recommend shareholders to accept an
improved takeover bid from a consortium led by Mirror Group Newspapers
which owns over 47 per cent of NP.  A decision was due to be taken on
28th February or 1st March 1994.
Members of the National Union of Journalists at the two titles called
on Ian Hay Davison, chairman of the board of independent directors of
NP, to reject the bid for the company from the MGN consortium because
it failed to guarantee the independence of the titles or provide a
stable framework of ownership and control.

before taking the unusual items and the cost of the Southam investment
into account.
Revenue rose to C$888 million from C$870 million.  The net cost of the

MIN'S EXCLUSIVE ANALYSES OF THE WEEKLIES'/BIWEEKLIES' 1995 AD PAGES:
"FORBES" FOUR-PEATS; "TIME" BEATS "NEWSWEEK" BY A "NEWT."

If American voters support Presidential candidate Steve Forbes in 1996
in the manner that advertisers have supported his magazine since 1992,
he can start pre-paring his guest list for his January 20, 1997,
inauguration.  For in the business magazines' 1995 ad-page race,
Forbes won by 731.47 and 1,350.38 "landslides" over Business Week and
Fortune, respectively.  Since 1991, when BW last beat Forbes, the
biweekly's ad pages have shot up by 977.60 to last year's 4,543.60
(+27.38% versus 1991; +9.32% versus 1994).  It is a fine salute to the
just-retired vp-advertising/promotion Steve Nicoll, who worked at the
magazine for 31 years (10 fewer than editor Jim Michaels).

* House Speaker Newt Gingrich's impact on Washington, D.C., made him
Time's 1995 "Man of the Year" (see page 1), and Newt's puss on the De-
cember 25 cover provided the difference of the year in Time's 19.10 ad-
page margin over Newsweek.  The latter's associate publisher, Greg
Osberg, is not perturbed, telling min that "exclude the intra-company
'affiliated' ad pages [19.60 out of Newsweek's 2,299.10], and we win
hands down."  Whatever, the change in the Time managing editor lineup--
Walter Isaacson for Jim Gaines--should add further spice to the 1996
contest.  And don't yet count out U.S. News & World Report, which
finished third last year (-5.71%) after being the newsweeklies' champ
from 1992 through 1994.

* Although USN&WR was one of only seven out of the 31
weeklies/biweeklies to lose ad pages in 1995, the overall momentum
from 1994 continued.  If the monthlies' performance is a barometer,
then this year should start slowly...except for Financial World
(-11.96% in 1995), which--believe it or not--expects to set an all-
time ad-page record (dating back to 1902) with its January 16
"Forecast 500" issue.  In min next week: weeklies'/biweeklies' year-
end "numbers crunch" plus fourth-quarter and five-year data.

The horrific photograph of firefighter Chris Fields holding the
lifeless body of one-year-old Baylee Almon--among the youngest of the
169 victims of the April 19, 1995, terrorist bombing of the Alfred

unanimous best-sellers for Newsweek/Time/U.S. News & World Report (May
1 issues), thus matching the obituary of Jacqueline Onassis (May 30,
1994, issues).  We qualify the USA Today compilation (in its December
18 edition) because it doesn't take into account November and December

IN MIN'S "GUESS 'TIME'S' MAN OF THE YEAR" CONTEST: RUNAWAY VOTE-GETTER
RABIN LEAVES NEWT KNOTTED IN RUNNER-UP TIE.

When the newsweekly's editors deferred to Pope John Paul II as "Man of
the Year" 12 months ago, many thought ascendant House Speaker Newt
Gingrich deserved the honor.  But when Gingrich--who is now dropping
like a rock in the polls as rigor mortis sets in on the idled U.S.
government--was named this year's designee (December 25, 1995/January
1, 1996), some felt the Pontiff, fresh from a whirlwind East Coast
visit, better fit the bill.  Such is life when it comes to choosing
Time's annual honoree.  

* The 125 entrants in min's sixth annual "Name Time's Man of the Year"
contest experienced a few difficulties of their own.  While Gingrich
tied with computing pioneer Bill Gates for second place in the min
tallies (15 votes apiece, or 11.9%), Yitzhak Rabin (part of Time's
quartet of 1993 winners) won going away.  But even though the late
Israeli prime minister garnered 35 min votes (28%), no dead
person--not even JFK after his 1963 assassination--has ever been
selected since "Man of the Year's" inception in 1923.  Other popular
choices: Internet (13 votes); O.J. Simpson (12); Bill Clinton and
Colin Powell (five each); and Cal Ripken, Jr., and Balkans leaders
Izetbegovic/Milosevic/Tudjman (four each).

* As for min's prize-winning prognosticators, ad sales rep Ed Bowen
takes the cake--and our $350 first-place check.  Not only was our top
dog the first to pick Gingrich--who represents the Marietta, Ga.-based
Bowen Group principal in Congress--but he also clicked on both
tiebreakers (Winston Churchill was Time's "Man of the Half-Century"
[1949], with Mikhail Gorbachev named "Man of the 1980s" [1989]). 
Runners-up Elizabeth Ruch, who works with NAA's Newspaper National
Network, and paper market analyst Mak Kenyon of A.T. Clayton & Co. get
min checks for $175 and $75, respectively.  

* We also salute these 12 readers who correctly named Gingrich but
finished out of the money either because of filing later than our
winners or missing the tie-breakers:

WITH THE MPA'S PRE-CHRISTMAS REALIGNMENT: IT'S COLEMAN-TO-KENNEY,
ROUND 3.

"I thought I was finished with Tom," jokes Reader's Digest publisher
Greg Coleman, "but I guess the gods wouldn't accept it."  He is
referring to this trifecta: (1) the November promotion of Reader's
Digest Association/USA president Tom Kenney to president of RDA's
Global Magazine/Corporate Development unit; (2) last month's election
of Kenney as chairman of the Magazine Publishers of America board of
directors; and (3) the fact that it makes Kenney serve as Coleman's
"boss" for the third time.  When Kenney moved up at RDA, it seemingly
ended a direct working relationship with Coleman that dated back to
the early 1980s at Woman's Day, and entered a second phase at RD in
1990 (min, November 13, 1995).  But Kenney's MPA election--made
necessary by the resignations of Claeys Bahrenburg and Francis
Pandolfi--puts him in charge of the 1996 American Magazine Conference
[October 13-16], which is being put together by a team led
by...Coleman.  If he and Kenney work as well with the AMC as they did
at RD, it should be an acceptable--and "Digest-ible"--affair.  Con-
ference details are to come.
       * Coleman and Kenney set a precedent with two executives from the
same company holding key MPA positions, but a more significant
precedent is the election of Essence Communications founder
(1970)/publisher/ceo Ed Lewis as MPA secretary (succeeding Kenney). 
Lewis is the first African-American to serve on the board of
directors, and if the ascension proceeds accordingly, he will be
chairman in 1998.

JOE OSTROW IS A CONTENTED CABLE CAMPER.

       Later in January, he will celebrate his "sweet 16" (months, that
is) as Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau president/ceo, and Ostrow
tells min that his industry's best of times is now.  He points to the
November sweeps that showed the combined ABC/CBS/NBC/Fox audience down
to 53% (from 59%) in November 1995, and basic cable's best-ever 19.5
rating for the week ending December 10.  "The 'sea change' is perman-
ent," he says. "Viewers are looking for programs more closely aligned
with their particular tastes and interests, and it is time for [ad]
agencies to realize that the broadcast networks are on a perpetual
downslide." 
* Ostrow, who spent three decades on the agency side (most with
FCB/Leber Katz Worldwide Worldwide), concurs with McCann-Erickson
Worldwide senior vp Bob Coen's +14% cable-advertising forecast for
1996, but disagrees with the $5.3 billion sum.  "Bob used an old $2.31
billion figure for 1994 as his base, which was later adjusted by Niel-
sen, Competitive Media Reporting, and others to over $3 billion.  We
should exceed $6 billion this year."  As for overall 1996 advertising,
Ostrow predicts a "strong first half, with the second-half outcome
predicated on the presidential candidates [who they are], and how
successful new business ventures are.  I'm bifocused."

TICKETMASTER GOES "LIVE!" WITH 40 AD PAGES IN MAGAZINE DEBUT.

     When the curtain goes up on Live! January 23 (February issue), it
will be more than just another of some 800+ magazine launches
anticipated in 1996.  At least that's what its parent, Ticketmaster
Corp., hopes.  Under editor Annie Gilbar and publisher Carole Ference
(ex-House Beautiful), the company believes it can exploit its
entertainment world contacts and vast database of people who regularly
attend live events to forge its place among entertainment magazines. 
With $1.6 billion in 1994 sales, the giant ticket "middleman" may be
on to something.  In its debut, Live!--the brainchild of Ticketmaster
chief Fred Rosen--will run 40 ad pages from the likes of Estee Lauder
and Chrysler Corp..  In coming months, Ference and her sales staff (ad
director is Hearst alumnus Michael Petruncola) will duke it out with
the likes of Entertainment Weekly, Premiere, Rolling Stone, and US for
the almighty ad dollar.  In her first pitch, Ference tells us, "We
know who entertainment customers are and what they buy.  And we have
many ways to reach them: the magazine itself, concert promotions,
ticket stub backs, customer databases, even the Ticketmaster Web site"
(http://ticketmaster.com).  Let the battle begin.

RON GALOTTI AS MATINEE IDOL?  NO...BUT HE GETS A TASTE OF SOAP
STARDOM.

     This Monday (January 8), the Vogue publisher can be seen--and maybe
heard--on a segment of the ABC-TV soap-opera "The City" that airs at
12:30 p.m. (Eastern).  Galotti plays a magazine publisher (who else?)
hosting a party attended by "The City" star Morgan Fairchild.  Whether
this turns into a recurring role will depend on his "Q" rating, which--
if the magazine community comprised the entire viewing audience--would
go through the roof.  As of now, Galotti is not a nominee for any of the
Soap Opera Digest awards, which are scheduled for a Valentine's Day
telecast (during the "heart" of the February sweeps) on NBC-TV at 9 p.m.

PIB: 1995 MAGAZINE AD $$$ SHOULD BREAK THE $10 BILLION BARRIER.

     The 201 measured Publishers Information Bureau magazines need to
accumulate $805.1 million in December 1995 ad revenues to achieve the
goal, and that should be a cinch, given that the then-185 PBI members
totaled $825.0 million in December 1994.  Still, last month's ad-page
slowdown (the monthlies in min's boxscores were cumulatively -1.15%)
will be reflected in the ad-revenue differential, which will be nowhere
near December 1995's +18.0%. Year-end results will be in the January 15
min; January-through-November categorical data are below:

Editor's note: Given the magazine industry's rampant rate-card
discounting--plus offering such valuable add-ons as marketing extras
and bonuses that are not factored into these totals--all dollar
figures should be viewed with caution.

AT&T TO OFFER ELECTRONIC DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE

Through its Consumer Communications Services business unit, AT&T has
just filed a proposal with the FCC to offer an "electronic directory
assistance" service. The service, which as of yet has not been
officially named, becomes effective January 18, according to
spokesman Bruce Reid.
 The service targets high-volume directory assistance users (banks,
financial services firms and retailers, for instance). Subscribers
access the service via an identification code and password through
either AT&T's Accunet(R) Packet Service or through the originating
telco packet switch network. The prices vary according to which
method of access subscribers choose. Using Accunet, the price is a
$2500-per- month subscription fee, plus a $22-per-hour holding time
charge, and 35 cents per screen. Using the local telco, the price
would run $500 for the monthly subscription fee, $22 hourly holding,
and 40 cents per screen. (This pricing structure is Southwestern
Bell's; other telcos may vary.) Mr. Reid pointed out that "a nickel
difference between per- screen charges doesn't seem like much, but
with the volume of accesses expected, these fees will most likely
balance out." He also added, "We are offering a promotion for those
who order an installation by February 28. We'll waive the monthly fee
through March (subscribers begin paying it in April), plus we're
offering one free ID and password--a savings of $100."
 What do subscribers get for their investment? Access to the same
screens directory assistance operators call up in response to
customer inquiries. When the EDA service starts up in January, the
Southwestern Bell area listings will be available. AT&T is
negotiating with the other RBOCs and hopes to work out agreements
with all of them for complete national access to directory assistance
listings.
 U S WEST has also agreed to have its directory assistance listings
available on the AT&T service, but not until a pending waiver request
is granted and tariff filed. U S WEST's proposed Electronic White
Pages (EWP) service was originally formulated when AT&T approached U
S WEST about the plans for this electronic directory assistance
product. U S WEST opted to build and maintain the database
themselves, making AT&T a non-exclusive distributor of the
information. As stated in the December, 1989 issue of The Morgan
Report, U S WEST has plans for other vendors to offer the database,
although AT&T is the only one in place at this time. Several sources
intimated that NYNEX would also be entering into an agreement with
AT&T, but this was not confirmed as of press time.
 TMR wonders what impact an electronic (computer-access) directory
assistance service will have on the white pages CD-ROM products on
the market. A number of niche markets for the CD-ROM products would
not be touched, such as smaller companies with local and regional
markets, and those using the CD-ROM white pages for  specialized
searching. But the big-dollar markets, including banks and retailers
with large volume look-up requirements, and for whom up-to- the-
minute accuracy is important, are likely purchasers of this service.
 Several RBOC's and private firms currently offer white page listings
on CD-ROM. None has national coverage. All of these companies have
acknowledged intense customer interest in obtaining national
coverage. TMR sees the potential for this new national electronic
directory assistance service to take business away from the CD-ROM
products. However, since the CD-ROM products offer more developed
searching features, they will probably remain competitive in certain
niche markets, attracting users in areas such as law enforcement,
market research and bill collection. These white page databases,
among the largest in the world, have been sought after by a number of
publishers.  Some have sought to link all seven RBOC's in some
fashion, but none has been successful at it. If AT&T pulls all the
RBOC's together to create what is effectively a gateway into these
seven physically separate databases, it will be a first. TMR expects
mounting activity in this area as the complex legal issues
surrounding ownership of this information continue to be explored.
Ownership and access to this information is of major interest to all
those professionally involved in building information products.
 Editor's Note: At press time, it was reported that AT&T has also
reached agreement with CompuServe to offer its 800 number database on-
 line to CompuServe's over 500,000 subscribers free of connect time
charges. An AT&T spokesperson preferred to characterize the
arrangement as a "unique form of directory assistance" and not a
foray into electronic publishing. TMR will continue to watch with
interest as AT&T continues its slow but seemingly inevitable movement
toward becoming a major player in electronic and possibly print
publishing.

AMERICAN BUSINESS INFORMATION'S BUSINESS INFOLINE

American Business Information, Inc. (Omaha, NE) has begun a 900-
number directory assistance service based on its business information
database.
 Called "Business Infoline," the service provides live operator-
assisted access to ABI's database of U.S. yellow page listing
information. Operators can conduct searches by category (type of
company), company name, partial name, or area code and phone number.
Geographical searches can be done on the basis of city, three- or
five- digit ZIP code, state, or nationwide. In addition to names,
addresses and phone numbers, operators can give users additional
information on a company based on its yellow page advertising
profile. For instance, one caller wanted to know if a particular
florist also carried balloons. Based on the company's advertising,
the operator was able to determine that yes, the florist did in fact
sell balloons.
 According to Bill Chasse, vice president of online products with
ABI, the most frequent calls so far have been requests for phone
numbers when the whereabouts of a company is unknown. "About half of
the calls from our business clients are consumer-oriented. For
instance, one man had his windshield broken. He called us to find the
nearest windshield repair shop, after he looked in the yellow pages
and found there weren't any suitable shops in the local area it
covered."
 Usage of the service has reportedly been very good. "When we first
launched the service, we estimated calls would last an average of 3
minutes. We have found that calls are actually averaging 6-8
minutes," Mr. Chasse said. "When the first request gets a hit, the
caller gets excited and can generally think of a number of other look-
up requests."
 The cost is $2 for the first minute and $1 for each additional
minute. Mr. Chasse explained that it doesn't take callers long to
figure out the economics: "They know if they have their look-ups
ready to go, our operators can do quite a few searches in that one or
two minutes."
 Business Infoline is intended both for business customers and
consumers. Marketing has been conducted via press releases on a
regular basis to a database of 5,000 media personnel and space
advertising in a number of business-
oriented publications (such as the Wall Street Journal, and The
Washingtonian). "We have primarily been marketing to our existing
customers by including flyers and information sheets in every order
and mailing we send them. Starting the first of the year, we will be
doing a little direct mail, sending out a plastic card people can
keep in a wallet; we realize how important it is that people remember
the number," explained Mr. Chasse. "We will also be stepping up our
consumer-oriented advertising, with TV and space advertising geared
toward them. We see the Infoline as a 60% consumer, 40% business
service."
 The Morgan Report has been watching 900 numbers as a potentially
excellent way to distribute directory information and charge for it
easily. But success in 900 numbers is a pure dollars equation. The
question is, can you afford enough promotion to build adequate call
volume? A company can have the slickest service in the world, but it
cannot prosper if people don't know about it.
 TMR expects to see a lot more directory publishers looking into 900
numbers. The ability to offer live operators assistance on 900 lines
is a fairly recent development, and should make 900 that much more
attractive to many directory publishers.
 Interested TMR subscribers may call the "Business Infoline" at
900/896-6000.
 Editor's Note: As TMR expected, American Business Information, Inc.
will be launching a new CD-ROM product based on its nationwide
database of approximately 8.3 million companies. The information is
not current, published about 4-5 months after the publication of the
yellow page directories from which it is culled, but searching will
be sophisticated. TMR will be watching this product closely. It is
HEAD = ORACLE FORMS
PUBLISHING SUBSIDIARY
 Oracle Corporation (Belmont, CA), reportedly the world's largest
supplier of database software and the third largest software and
services company, has announced the formation of a new publishing
subsidiary. The new company is called Oracle Data Publishing (ODP).
 ODP's charter is to provide its customers access to a variety of
computer-based information services which can assist them in making
critical business decisions. It will acquire and sell, in electronic
format, a broad range of data and information which many Oracle
customers already use in print form. Dick Brass, a pioneer in the
field of electronic publishing, has been named president of the new
subsidiary.
 "Oracle Data Publishing is a natural extension of our proven
expertise in database software and services," said Larry Ellison,
Oracle's president and CEO. "With ODP, we will give customers the
information they need in addition to the software required to access
and manipulate that information."
 According to Mr. Brass, the growing transition from printed to
electronic information distribution, coupled with the proliferation
of database management software, makes Oracle a logical entrant into
the data publishing arena.
 Prior to joining Oracle, Dick Brass was founder of General
Information (Kirkland WA), which publishes The National Directory of
Addresses and Telephone Numbers, and other products in both print and
electronic formats. Before General Information, Mr. Brass acquired
the exclusive electronic rights to a number of important reference
works, including The Random House Dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, and
Black's Law Dictionary.
 This development is an important one to watch. Oracle is well-known
for its aggressiveness in its markets, one of which is now in the
directory realm. No specifics were available on products planned, but
rollout of its first products are expected within the year.

U S WEST ON SPECIALTY DIRECTORY PUBLISHING

U S WEST is the only Regional Bell to refrain from publishing
directories outside the traditional yellow page arena. The Morgan
Report recently spoke to Philip Unger, director of marketing with U S
WEST Direct, about the company's point of view on specialty directory
publishing, which should be of interest to all directory publishers.
 "We did analyze the possible needs for specialty directory
products," Mr. Unger said. "Our first conclusion was to concentrate
on our 14- state area. Otherwise, outside our region,  we felt we'd
start with two strikes against us" in an unfamiliar publishing
venture in an unfamiliar market.
 "We also scoped out the size of the breadbox, and saw that there is
a lot less money (in specialty publishing) than we're used to in the
traditional yellow page arena. We saw that the margins would be much
lower--with increased costs for distribution, sales, databases--
particularly the distribution database, where we'd be starting from
scratch. The sales cost would be much higher per dollar of revenue,
so we saw publishing specialty directories would be smaller in
revenues and in profit.
 "After we had looked at size, we looked at need. We didn't want to
just throw something out there--it would have to meet a real need.
And there would have to be a high quality editorial effort as well,
to create strong editorial content--
not just a 95% advertising product. We made a list of the top 20
specialty directories that would fit into our region. We prioritized
them, and did a business case on two of them. We found that we
couldn't both meet the need and make a profit. We could do a great
job but lose money, or we could cut corners and make money--and have
it fail the second or third year. We didn't like either of those
options."
 Mr. Unger said that U S WEST Direct continues to look at specialty
publishing, but doesn't want to go into it for the PR value alone.
"We are in business to meet needs and keep shareholders happy."
 It should be a reassuring note to non-yellow page directory
publishers that despite virtually unlimited resources, the RBOC
publishing organizations have such a high cost of doing business that
there are few directory opportunities they can justify pursuing. The
thinking is becoming increasing common among the RBOC's, that few, if
any, start- up directory opportunities are worth the risk.

AMERICAN EXPORT REGISTER DISCOUNT OFFER

An unusual renewal program instituted by Thomas International
Publishing Company (New York, NY) for its American Export Register
recently came to The Morgan Report's attention. "This program, the
Qualified Lifetime Subscriber Program, allows all overseas buyers who
purchase their first set at the full retail price ($120) an 85%
credit toward all future consecutive editions they purchase,"
explained circulation director Ms. Renate Oechsner.
 The program was first offered to purchasers of the '87-88 edition
when it came time for them to purchase the '88-89 edition of the
Register. Ms. Oechsner said that the response to the offer "has been
very nice. People are even paying by credit card, because the price
is low; it used to be such a hassle for them to get a check in U.S.
funds and send it."
 The reason given for the program, which reduces renewal subscription
rates to shipping costs ($18 surface, $39 air mail), is an effort to
build circulation. "It does our advertisers no good if people buy one
year and not for the next four." As many publishers have suffered, so
the Register has suffered the whims of those who go several years
before updating to a new edition of the directory. Because the
American Export Register is primarily advertising-based, fluctuating
sales are particularly exasperating. "With increased circulation, our
advertisers will be happy, and more will want to get into the
Register--the two things go hand in hand, and hopefully will get
better and better," Ms. Oechsner added.
 According to Ms. Oechsner, the directory is "not quite controlled
circulation (with this program), but we do qualify (subscribers) with
a questionnaire. It helps give us develop information we can then
give to advertisers, such as where subscribers buy materials and how
many companies they have contacted through the directory."
 The American Export Register is an annual guide to U.S. products and
services available for export. It targets "businessmen,
industrialists, and government buyers worldwide." The directory is
comprised of a two-volume set.
 This move by Thomas is interesting because it creates a whole new
relationship with subscribers. It asks them to pay for a directory
the first time around, proving their interest and setting the value
of the directory. From then on, only a small annual maintenance fee
(enough to cover shipping) is required to continue receiving future
editions. This pricing strategy allows Thomas to offer advertisers a
paid subscriber base, and the nominal price allows Thomas to offset
some of its costs--important with the cost of shipping a two-volume
directory overseas. The final benefit to Thomas is that the nominal
invoice it renders each year is a continued check on subscriber
interest and helps keep the circulation file clean and current.
Overall, this strategy may be worth looking into, even for some
domestic buying guides.

MARKET OVERVIEW: ADOPTION DIRECTORIES

The Morgan Report has noticed a rise in activity in the field of
adoption information. A variety of first-edition directories covering
this information have appeared in the last 12 months or so, building
on the hodge-podge of directories and directory sections of other
publications already published. Here's the run-down:
 The Adoption Directory (Gale Research, Inc.). Billed as "a guide to
agencies, state laws on adoption, exchanges, support groups, and
professional service in domestic and international adoption,
including foster parenting and biological options." The directory is
arranged alphabetically within subject-oriented chapters, and is
supported by keyword, agency name and geographical indexes.
Approximately 1,500 listings are included. A typical agency listing
covers information on application procedures, prerequisites, fees,
length of waiting time for a child, and a description of the children
placed. It sells for $55.
 CWLA's Guide to Adoption Agencies: A National Directory of Adoption
Agencies and Adoption Resources (Child Welfare League of America).
Editor: Julia L. Posner (with James Guilianelli, contributing
editor). This directory appears to be in direct competition with the
Gale directory. This directory has going for it the prestige of being
associated with the Child Welfare League--no small benefit. The
directory sells for $15.95.
 Adoption: The Guide to Successful Adoptions (Ulick Publishing
Company). Another newcomer to the field, but in a magazine format.
Julia Posner contributed the section on traditional agency adoption;
she is, as noted above, the editor of CWLA's Guide. The magazine
targets adoptive or prospective adoptive parents, and others seeking
to wade through the adoption mire. The National Adoption Directory,
comprises half the magazine's pages and lists "adoption facilitators"
state-by-state, within categories (agencies, case workers,
foundations, lawyers, support groups, etc.). The directory only
includes those who returned questionnaires. The reason given for this
is the desire only to present those "who want to help with your
adoption." A number of adoption facilitators have their hands full
and chose not to list. Listings include name, contact name, address,
phone, local or national operation, and number of years in operation.
A banner at the end of the directory section states that more
listings will appear in the next issue of Adoption magazine. The
cover price for the magazine is $5 an issue, $30 per year
(bimonthly). Revenues are generated by subscription; no advertising
is included.
 Adoption: Parenthood Without Pregnancy (Henry Holt and Company). The
directory content is secondary, with an appendix listing agencies and
support groups. The last edition published was 1986, which sold for
$18.45.
 Adoption Resource Book (Harper & Row Publishers, Inc.). The
directory section is secondary and covers public and private adoption
agencies and support groups. Listings include agency name, address,
phone, and special requirements. The latest edition was published in
November, 1987 and sold for $17.95 (hardbound); $8.85 (softbound).
 Our Child: Preparing for Parenting in Adoption--Instructor's Guide
(Our Child Press). This directory lists as part of its appendixes
audiovisual aids, resources, books, and periodicals available to
those teaching courses on adoptive parenting. The last issue was
published in 1988, with another due out perhaps in 1990. The primary
content of the publication is a curriculum guide for instructors of
new parents.
 SourceList (Committee for Single Adoptive Parents). This is an
annual directory of about 50 agencies and organizations that are
sources of adopted children accepting unmarried applicants. It has
international coverage. The listings are geographically arranged and
sell for $15 including three updates, but the directory is sold only
to unmarried members of the organization.
 Discussion: The activity in this market appears to be an example of
social tide driving the need for (and the provision of) information.
It is unusual for several directories with virtually the same content
and scope to appear at the same time, as is the case with the CWLA
and Gale directories. Gale has a strong hold on the library market,
and the CWLA directory has substantial prestige behind it. How well
these directories fare will depend in large part on how well they
reach their target markets. Other opportunities in this field seem to
lie in areas touched but not yet fully developed. For example,
SourceList covers an important and needed body of information, but is
seriously undermarketed, and has the potential for greater
information development. TMR expects more titles in this field
because the need for information continues to grow, and new user
constituencies are likely to emerge, bringing with them a need for
more timely and detailed information in this field.

BARCLAYS LAUNCHES SHARE DEALING BY VIDEO

Barclays Bank has unveiled the BarclayZone interactive sharedealing and
information service, a prototype version of which went live on Monday
in three branches, Fenchurch Street, City of London, Crawley, West
Sussex, and Maidstone, Kent.

The system, developed by Barclays Multimedia, the bank's interactive
technology unit, has no keyboard, and customers operate the terminal by
touching the screen. The menu of options includes simple tutorials
about financial topics such as the stock market. For #2.50, paid by
credit card, users can obtain investment opinions on any of 100 FTSE
and a further 25 popular stocks from a printer built into the system.
It also offers a real-time account of City news via a MarketEye screen.

Unlike the touchscreen PC-based sharedealing service which National
Westminster Bank has operated in its high street network since 1986,
BarclayZone includes a videoconferencing link to an adviser at Barclays
Stockbrokers' head office in Glasgow. This is used for buying and
selling shares, with dealing costs starting at #15, the same as dealing
by telephone.

The same video technology could allow Barclays, subject to customer
acceptance, to offer a broad range of financial services such as
insurance, tax services and mortgage advice through computer screens in
bank branches or kiosks in public places. Last year, it set up
BarclaySquare, an Internet-based electronic shopping mall, as well as
an interactive information service for its customers on the Internet.

SILICON GRAPHICS EXPERIENCES REVENUE SLOWDOWN

Silicon Graphics, the US graphics workstation vendor, warned that
earnings per share for its second quarter to 31 December 1995 would be
around 30 cents, down from 34 cents a year earlier. It also said
revenues would rise by only 23% to $675m from $550m in the same quarter
of 1994.

Analysts had predicted 43 cents a share and a 40-45% increase in
revenues for Silicon Graphics' second quarter. Following the profit
warning, which led to an immediate 16% drop in Silicon Graphics' share
price, analysts cut their earnings estimates for the financial year to
30 June 1996 by 15-20%.

Chairman Edward McCracken said revenue growth in Europe and North
America had not met the company's expectations, due to a slowdown in
sales to the US government as a result of federal budget uncertainties
and also to economic slowdowns in the UK, France and Germany. Sales via
third party channels were below expectations, he added. Revenues were
also affected by customers who decided to wait for a new range of high-
performance Silicon Graphics computers due to be launched this month
based on the new R1000 microprocessor.

Silicon Graphics has been experiencing annual revenue growth of 45-50%
over the last few years, more than double the growth rate for the
entire workstation market. Capitalising on demand for graphical
workstations in fast-growing markets such as video editing, Web site
design and computer game development, Silicon Graphics is now number
three behind Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard.

Analysts said that although Silicon Graphics faces a threat from
aggressive price cuts by Sun Microsystems and the new breed of high-
specification multimedia PCs, it does not face any long-term problems.
Its 23% second quarter growth rate is above the industry average, for
example, and its new Indigo2 Impact workstation, launched in the second
quarter, has received an "outstanding" response from customers.

EPIC RECEIVES 3I CASH INJECTION

Brighton-based Epic Multimedia Group has received #1m in funding from
venture capitalists 3i.

EMG, which was set up in 1985 as a multimedia production company
working for corporate clients such as the BBC, National Westminster
Bank and BT, will use the funding to expand its consumer game and
educational CD-ROM publishing activities. "We are looking to develop
our own content with reduced involvement from large publishing co-
funders", says managing director Jim Brathwaite.

EMG is also preparing for a flotation sometime next year, says newly-
appointed finance director Andrew Duncan. However, Mr Duncan stresses
that the timing and access route for a public offering have yet to be
determined. The options under review include joining London's new
Alternative Investment Market for smaller stocks or a full listing on
the Stock Exchange. New York's Nasdaq is also a possibility, given the
importance of the US market to EMG, Mr Duncan says.

EMG, which in November 1995 completed a #1m private placing of
convertible loanstock with Henry Cooke Lumsden, has quadrupled in size
over the last two years and now has a staff of around 150. In May 1994
it raised #1.5m from UK venture capitalists Quester and from Dutch-
based Atlas Venture.

In an interview published in the Financial Times management report
Financing Multimedia in Europe by Janet Robson, Gerard Montanus of
Atlas Venture said that Atlas sees multimedia as a specific niche
market within IT. Multimedia companies such as EMG are currently
regarded and valued more like IT businesses than as publishing
businesses, Mr Montanus suggested. Atlas typically invests in companies
for four to six years, normally structuring its deals as equity and
subsequently putting in follow-on capital.

Publishing partnerships

EMG's publishing division has four separate units - Learning,
Entertainment, Medical & Healthcare, and Lifestyle. It develops CD-ROM
and CD-i titles in association with major international companies, but
retains significant intellectual property rights. Its $3.6m three-year
development funding and publishing deal with Time Warner Interactive
provides EMG with marketing and distribution channels for releases such
as Thumbelina, a children's title based on an animated Warner Bros
feature film by Don Bluth of the Hans Andersen story.

EMG Publishing is involved in three multimedia development operations -
the Spice Factory joint venture with film producers Jason Piette and
Michael Cowen specialising in fantasy/adventure games as well as films
and TV programmes; Eagle Peak, a collaboration with independent
producer New Media Vision specialising in interactive comic books and
encyclopaedias; and children's and educational publisher Labyrinth.

EMG provides all the funding for each of these companies but gives the
individual developers an equity stake in their own venture in addition
to considerable creative independence.

Eagle Peak is developing the Takeru series of CD-ROM titles based on
the highly-popular Japanese-language comic books of the same name.
Labyrinth is working on a number of CD-ROM titles funded by Time Warner
Interactive such as the multimillion pound project Drowned God
(previously given the code name Iron Horse), tipped as TWI's lead for
its Christmas 1996 release schedule.

The Spice Factory is developing a CD-ROM game jointly funded by EMG
Publishing and film company Pachyderm (a subsidiary of Goldcrest Films)
based on the science fiction film Space Truckers. The game is being pre-
sold country by country with the film. Spice Factory is also due to
release its first feature film, The Killer Tongue, this year.

Although 50-60% of EMG's business comes from its long-established
corporate communications work, it sees most of its future growth coming
from consumer multimedia publishing. In addition, EMG has set up a team
to design user interfaces for interactive TV networks such as BT's East
Anglian trial for which EMG also produced National Westminster Bank's
interactive banking interface.

Another significant growth area for EMG is likely to be the Internet.
Just before Christmas, Scotland Online, a joint venture between
Scottish Telecom and cartoon publisher D.C. Thompson, went live with
Web pages designed by EMG Interactive, EMG's corporate communications
division. In addition to the corporate Web site market, EMG sees great
potential for its intellectual properties in consumer Internet
publishing and games-on-demand.

1996 is likely to be an exciting year for EMG's CD-ROM publishing
division, with the launch of the first fruits of its three publishing
joint ventures. In addition, several major new titles are expected by
December which will eventually be available over the Internet, says Jim
Brathwaite. He also promises a deal with an unspecified UK partner to
produce a CD-ROM and hard copy tie-in.

INNER WORKINGS INTERIM SALES AHEAD

Inner Workings plc, the Glasgow-based CD-ROM developer, reported sales
of #186,911 for the six months to 30 September 1995, compared to
#24,142 a year earlier.

The loss on ordinary activities widened to #115,736 from #65,983 last
time, reflecting the company's investment in production facilities and
staff outlined in its prospectus at  its Alternative Investment Market
flotation last August. Inner Workings raised #1m net of costs to fund
expansion through its share placing.

Alistair King of London stockbrokers Charles Stanley predicts that
Inner Workings will become profitable in 1997 and suggests that it
might be acquired by a larger concern interested in its skilled staff.

Last year the company completed the first two titles in a range of four
children's CD-ROMs for Oxford University Press, The Fish Who Could Wish
and A Christmas Story. Eight foreign language versions of these titles
are under active negotiation, with the first of these due for delivery
to the European market by spring 1996. The remaining two OUP children's
titles, Winnie the Witch and Dragons, will be launched in May.

Chairman Lesley Keen says Inner Workings has established the
foundations of an advanced software engineering facility which is
intended to be used to produce the company's own educational and games
software. The first "own brand" title is planned to go into production
in late spring 1996.

The first product in a three-title CD-ROM deal with Reed Consumer Books
is expected to be released for the Christmas 1997 market, says Ms Keen.


Inner Workings is close to signing a co-production deal with a major
global publisher on a children's activity game title for the Christmas
1996 market, and is entering the prototype development phase on a CD-
ROM title for Philips Media for the US market.

APPLE, REPRISE RECORDS IN NEW MEDIA PARTNERSHIP

Apple Computer is to work together with Warner Music label Reprise
Records to promote Reprise artists in tandem with Apple new media
technology and software. The collaboration will include joint
promotions, co-launching products such as enhanced CDs and cross-
promoting Web sites.

Apple is already working with UK-based record company EMI's new
multimedia division to produce enhanced CDs, soundcarriers which can be
played like ordinary audio CDs or run on a CD-ROM drive to view the
text and video they contain. In December Apple and EMI opened the Abbey
Road Interactive multimedia studio in London.

Reprise already has a reputation for innovative use of Apple technology
in its recording studios. Its Web site, which runs on an Apple server
and features e-mail access to artists such as Neil Young, Morrissey and
Enya, receives around 20,000 hits a day. In addition, the label plans
to release its first three enhanced CDs in first quarter 1996.

POLYGRAM ISSUES PROFIT WARNING, BUYS GOLDWYN LIBRARY

PolyGram, the Philips-owned entertainment group, warned last month that
profits for 1995 would be static against 1994, following a poor second
half. In the six months to June 1995, PolyGram, which has achieved a
20% compound annual growth rate in net income since 1990, saw profits
rise 15%.

In 1994 PolyGram recorded pre-tax profits of Fl 1.08bn (#436m) on sales
of Fl 8.6bn. Chairman Alain Levy said the group would return to profit
growth this year, due to an improved album release schedule including
new work from artists such as Sting, U2 and the Cranberries. He blamed
1995's poor performance on a below-par release schedule in the second
half, delays in the delivery of big albums, the lack of a major film
hit and the strength of the guilder.

In a bid to expand its four-year-old film business, PolyGram agreed
last month to buy the film and TV library of The Samuel Goldwyn
Company, the financially troubled US film group, for $62m (#39m) in
cash. Goldwyn, which has been seeking capital to reduce its debts, sold
the rights to 850 feature films including recent productions such as
The Madness of King George and Much Ado About Nothing as well as
several TV series.

The deal follows PolyGram's $156m purchase last January of Los Angeles-
based ITC Entertainment which owns the rights to 350 feature films and
vintage TV series in addition to running a programming distribution
business. Last year PolyGram entered the video CD market with a batch
of releases including its 1994 movie hit Four Weddings and a Funeral
and titles from rock bands such as Wet Wet Wet, Abba and The Who.

For Alain Levy, the key word is "leverage" - squeezing more revenue
from PolyGram's copyright material by leveraging it across multiple
distribution channels. This explains PolyGram's interest in
establishing more TV channels along the lines of its music video
channel collaboration with Viacom subsidiary MTV, a customer for much
of its music. It hopes to sell Goldwyn's film back catalogue as a
package to cable and TV channels with new films from its PolyGram
Filmed Entertainment unit.

However, although Mr Levy has abandoned his initial scepticism about
the information highway and his company is actively setting up
promotional Web sites, he believes that electronic distribution of
music via the Internet will never replace physical retailing. "Buying
music is a social experience, and the packaging of a product is very
important", he says.

use the archive to launch a history channel.

DGMT's Channel One London 24-hours news channel will use the archive to
produce programmes on social history. The archive will also provide
material for a CD-ROM on 20th century history currently being produced
by the Daily Mail.

TOTAL CD-ROM UNIT SALES UP 125% IN 1995

The seventh edition of US consultancy InfoTech's Optical Industry
Publishing Assessment predicts that total 1995 worldwide unit sales of
CD-ROM titles rose by 125% to 206m from 91.8m in 1994. The reports
covers all categories of CD-ROM titles.

Worldwide CD-ROM title revenue rose by only 70% to $18.1bn from
$10.7bn, due to the rapid expansion of the consumer sector where steep
discounting prevails because of intense competition for shelfspace and
widespread bundling.

In 1994, just over 20% of total worldwide CD-ROM revenues were derived
from consumer sales, with the remainder coming from the professional,
corporate and educational markets. The number of consumer CD-ROM titles
in print doubled to over 3,000 in 1994 and is expected to have doubled
again in 1995.

InfoTech predicts that in 1995 the consumer sector grew to 24% of the
total CD-ROM market. Led by strong sales of multimedia home PCs, the
worldwide installed base of CD-ROM drives for both PCs (all platforms)
and TV set-top systems such as CD-i, Sega and 3DO grew to 26.9m in
1994, and is forecast to rise by over 80% to 49.5m in 1995.

In 1995, for the first time, more CD-ROM drives were sold in new PCs
than in multimedia upgrade kits, by a margin of more than 2 to 1.
Preliminary research for 1995 suggests that around 35% of notebooks
sold worldwide were CD-ROM equipped, InfoTech says. By the year 2000,
more than 80% of all desktop PCs will have a CD-ROM drive and at least
50% of all TV set-top systems will have a CD-ROM drive instead of or in
addition to a cartridge player.

APPLE WARNS OF CHRISTMAS QUARTER LOSS

Apple Computer warned that it would post a loss for its first quarter
ending 31 December 1995, stunning analysts who had predicted net
profits for the quarter of around $87m. Apple has traditionally enjoyed
big sales in the run-up to Christmas and in the quarter to December
1994 posted net profits of $188m.

Apple said that an aggressive price-cutting campaign begun in August
had failed to stimulate expected demand for its Macintosh computers in
its key markets of Japan and the US, leaving it with unsold inventory.
Analysts now expect Apple to drastically streamline its operations
through up to 2,000 job losses and speculate that it will seek a merger
partner or put itself up for sale. Speculation centres on IBM, Sony or
Oracle as the most likely buyers. Oracle is believed to have made an
offer for Apple's Newton personal digital assistant unit to support its
own mobile computing ambitions.

In the quarter to 30 September 1995 Apple regained lost market share
and its position as the largest PC manufacturer in the US market.
However, this was due mainly to existing Apple users upgrading their
systems. Apple's latest financial results suggest that it has failed to
persuade new purchasers that the Macintosh is better than its Intel-
Microsoft equivalent.

APPLE'S MARKET SHARE IN GERMANY

Apple had around 4.4% of the German PC market in 1995, according to its
central European general manager Jan Gesmar-Larsen. He aims to sell
250,000 Apple computers in Germany in the fiscal year to 30 September
1996, 7% of the total market.

In the year to 30 September 1995, Apple's central European division
sold 220,000 computers in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and eastern
Europe, generating a 21% rise in revenues to $573m. This year it is
looking for revenues of $800m in the region.

APPLE TARGETS 3D GRAPHICS MARKET

Apple hopes to exploit the relative confusion in the Intel-Microsoft
camp with regard to multimedia standards to provide a clear lead in the
low-cost 3D graphics market.

In November Apple launched the QuickDraw 3D graphics accelerator,
which, coupled with its QuickDraw 3D software, is claimed to increase
the speed of 3D rendering by up to 12 times. Plugging into the PCI
(Peripheral Component Interconnect) slot on a Power Macintosh, the
graphics board costs #299.

Apple claims that a high-specification PowerMac equipped with the
QuickDraw board and software offers professional designers and
developers a low-cost alternative to a 3D graphics workstation from
market leader Silicon Graphics.

CIRRUS LOGIC DELAYS OFFERING AFTER PROFIT WARNING

Cirrus Logic, the US audio, video and graphics chip manufacturer, said
last month that it expects earnings of about 13-19 cents a share in its
third quarter to 31 December 1995, well below the consensus forecast of
44 cents. In the quarter to December 1994, Cirrus earned $14.5m net, or
46 cents a share.

Following a sharp drop in its share price in response to the profit
warning, Cirrus said it would delay a planned offering of 6m common
shares and $500m in convertible subordinated notes. It also said it
would reduce fiscal 1997 and 1998 capital expenditure by over $600m,
although it still intends to expand its manufacturing capacity during
1997-1999.

Cirrus has expanded over the last few years due to the growth in demand
for multimedia PCs. In the year to April 1995 it posted net profits of
$61.4m on sales of $889m, compared to net profits of $45.4m on sales of
$557.3m in 1994.

The company said results in the quarter to December had suffered from
softer than anticipated conditions in Taiwan and slower than expected
growth in the home PC market. Sales for the quarter ending March 1996
would depend on the success of several new graphics and audio products,
it added.

In November 1995, Cirrus warned that third quarter revenue growth would
be hit by reductions in orders for its multimedia chips from a major
customer, believed to be Intel. Analysts said Intel had cut its orders
because US computer manufacturer Packard Bell had stocked too many PC
motherboards containing a 32-bit Cirrus chip and had lost sales to 64-
bit versions from rival vendors such as Compaq. Packard Bell has also
suffered from overstocking of 75MHz Pentium-based PCs at a time when
consumers are opting for faster, competitively-priced PCs from other
vendors.

Tom Rigoli, vice president of corporate communications at Cirrus, said
that several customers are now seeking to have their advance chip
orders fulfilled sooner, suggesting a potential recovery in home PC
sales. Nevertheless, several key US analysts lowered their estimates of
Cirrus' earnings in fiscal 1997. Drew Peck of Cowen & Co, for example,
cut his forecast from $2.72 a share to $2.22.

AMSTRAD CUTS BACK CONSUMER ELECTRONICS ARM

Amstrad has announced a restructuring of its lossmaking Ace division
which produces a range of audio, video and satellite TV equipment for
the fiercely competitive consumer electronics market.

The decision to scale back Ace - once the core of Amstrad's empire -
and concentrate on Amstrad's higher-margin activities in direct PC
sales, modems and mobile telephones led to the resignation last month
of chief executive David Rogers, half way through a three-year
contract.

According to the Financial Times, an internal strategy paper was
presented to Amstrad's board last month warning that Ace could not be
revitalised and would not break even in the year to June 1996. In the
year ending 30 June 1995 Amstrad posted a pre-tax profit of #3.06m
after three years of losses and despite continuing losses at Ace
(Multimedia Business Analyst, 2/2/7).

ESCOM HIT BY PC PRICE WAR

Escom, the German PC manufacturer and retailer, says losses in calendar
1995 are expected to reach DM45m (#20.2m), due to the costs of its
rapid European expansion, weak fourth quarter sales and fierce price
cutting in the consumer market.

Sales rose from DM2.15bn in 1994 to only DM2.35bn last year, following
an "unsatisfactory" second half. In 1994 Escom posted profits of
DM11.1m.

Last May Escom bought over 200 Rumbelows stores in the UK, which it
expects to make "a considerable contribution to profits" in 1996.
Escom, which is the second largest PC vendor in Germany behind Vobis,
says it has completed its European expansion programme. It now has 455
European outlets compared to 268 at the end of 1994.

TIMETABLE FOR GERMAN TELECOM BILL AGREED

The German government and the main opposition party, the Social
Democratic Party, have agreed on a firm timetable for legislation to
liberalise the telecom market and end Deutsche Telekom's monopoly by 1
January 1998. A consensus on the main terms of the deregulation bill
had already been reached in November (Multimedia Business Analyst,
2/4/4).

This latest deal is important in ensuring that the legislation passes
both houses of parliament - the lower house (Bundestag) controlled by
the governing Christian Democrat/Free Democrat coalition and the upper
house (Bundesrat) controlled by the Social Democrats. It will go before
the Bonn cabinet on 24 January and parliamentary debate will begin next
month. With all-party consent, the new telecom bill is expected to
become law this summer.

This month, the Finance Ministry will hold a meeting to finally resolve
the political deadlock over the role of the telecom industry regulator
which will need to be set up prior to deregulation. It is thought
likely that the Finance Ministry will be responsible for the
government's stake in Deutsche Telekom after its partial privatisation
in late 1996 through a DM15bn share issue.

The bill will open up the DM75bn German telecom market, the third
largest in the world after the US and Japan, from 1998, while
preventing companies from abusing dominant positions. It will also pave
the way for an influx of investment by international telecom operators
such as BT, AT&T and Cable & Wireless, building on alliances they have
already formed with German companies.

The content of the bill will be largely as agreed by the political
parties in November. As well as paving the way for large operators to
offer nationwide services, the bill foresees a role for smaller and
medium-sized companies providing services. It will allow frequencies to
be made available locally to promote more competition through wireless
links.

The bill will also include an obligation on the government to ensure
the universal provision of affordable, high-standard telephone services
to all users. Telecom Minister Wolfgang Botsch says voice services
should have "advanced digital characteristics", ensuring that any
customer wanting ISDN services can expect to have them.

Providers of universal services - comprising standard home or office
services, pay telephones, directory enquiries and access to emergency
services - will be obliged to keep up with the latest technological
developments.

INDOSAT CONSIDERS CABLE TV PLANS

Indonesia's international telecom operator PT Indosat is planning to
offer cable TV services and has budgeted $11.92m to carry out an
evaluation for a possible entry into the sector, reports Asia-Pacific
Telecoms Analyst.

Indosat is believed to have acquired a small interest in Japanese cable
TV operator Suginami in a move said to be directly linked to plans to
set up a cable TV network in Indonesia this year or in 1997. Indosat
would probably carry out the cable TV project with PT Indocitra
Grahabawana, two of whose controlling shareholders also control one of
Indonesia's five private TV stations, PTR Surya Citra Televisi.

EC PASSES MOBILE TELEPHONE DEREGULATION DIRECTIVE

The EC announced before Christmas that a directive on mobile and
personal telecoms will come into effect from the beginning of January.
The directive requires member states to abolish all exclusive and
special rights in the mobile communications sector for monopoly
operators and to establish fair and open licensing procedures.

Operators holding licences for one mobile service will be able to apply
to run all digital mobile services such as GSM, DCS 1800 minicell and
DECT cordless. Member states may not refuse to allocate licences for
public access/Telepoint applications using the DECT short-range system
or, from 1998, licences for mobile systems on the DCS 1800 standard.
Moreover, they may not restrict combinations of mobile technologies.
The directive also gives mobile operators the right to build their own
infrastructure or to make use of alternative telecom infrastructures
run by railways and utilities.

AT&T AND BROADBAND ANNOUNCE LOW-COST ATM BREAKTHROUGH

North Carolina-based BroadBand Technologies and AT&T Microelectronics
have developed a low-cost chipset which they claim will enable
affordable ATM broadband services to be transmitted directly over
ordinary copper telephone wire to homes and businesses.

Kris Nasta, vice president of BroadBand's European operations, says the
chips will deliver the full functionality of fibre-to-the-home networks
but at costs approaching that of a normal telephone service.
The Multipoint Broadband Access (MBA) chipset offers 52Mbps ATM
transmission and incorporates Broadband's switched digital video (SDV)
technology and AT&T's 16-CAP (carrierless amplitude and phase
modulation) encoding and compression system. BroadBand's FLX (FibreLoop
Access) SDV System transmits bi-directional interactive multimedia over
fibre-to-the-curb networks to groups of 20-30 houses via an Optical
Network Unit (ONU). Because of its use of 16-CAP, FLX can carry
analogue cable TV signals as well as interactive services into the home
over the same coax wire using a diplexer.

16-CAP allows the re-use of existing Category 3 unshielded twisted pair
(UTP) copper wiring, the standard for kerbside-to-home installation,
for digital ATM and telephony traffic. It eliminates the need for the
complex modulation schemes, adaptive equalisation, high-frequency
analogue tuning and forward error correction required by competing
encoding/modulation technologies, Mr Nasta says.

The MBA chips are already being implemented as part of planned
deployments of BroadBand's FLX SDV System by France Telecom and of AT&T
Network Systems' SLC-2000 Access with FLX SDV System by Southwestern
Bell and Disney's Celebration Community, a test-bed for interactive
communications being built in Orlando, Florida.

TELECOM COMPETITION SPURS MULTIMEDIA GROWTH

The liberalisation of voice telecommunications across the European
Union from 1998 will lead to the growth of new services, including
multimedia, as operators look for new sources of income, says a report
from Cambridge-based Analysys Publications.

Existing telecom players - cable TV companies, managed network service
providers and telecom operators (TOs) - are all looking to secure
advantage. New players such as rail and power companies, entrants
backed by industrial consortia and start-ups based on advanced
technologies are already breaking into the lucrative ECU129bn telecom
market which is growing at a rate of 7% per annum, says Paul Knott,
author of New Network Operators in Europe.

Many of the new entrants look set to pursue niche market strategies,
targeting their price and new services at particular groups of
customers, in contrast with the broader marketing strategies pursued by
the incumbents, says Mr Knott. As they are not hampered by legacy
infrastructure, new entrants are busy investing in modern network
technologies such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and SDH
(Synchronous Digital Hierarchy). SDH is a prerequisite for ATM and both
technologies are important in the delivery of multimedia services. The
table on page 9 summarises current and planned deployment of of ATM and
SDH by a range of regional and national licensed TOs, managed network
service providers and infrastructure suppliers.

To date, most new operators are concentrating on building an initial
market position with modern technology, but with a fairly basic range
of services. Unless they choose to compete solely on price, a strategy
at which only one operator can be successful, they will need to develop
new services to maintain their revenues in the longer term.

"While modern technologies can help new players avoid many of the
legacy issues which affect the incumbents, they would be wrong to
assume that it necessarily gives them a competitive advantage", says Mr
Knott. "New operators will have to translate technology capabilities
into end-user services such as LAN interconnection, Internet access,
business video and interactive multimedia services, if they want to
maximise the value of their investment."

Incumbent TOs will need to respond to these attacks across all of their
markets. The report contends that their best strategy for confronting
the new operators may be to force the pace of competition by
aggressively introducing new services. With entrants busy investing in
expanding infrastructure and coverage, incumbents could use their
financial strength to fund the development of a broader range of
intelligent network services, multimedia and personal mobility
functions. However, new entrants or established managed network
services providers will also need to provide intelligent network-based
voice services.

The new entrants' initial infrastructure roll-out provides a ready made
market for new SDH, ATM and fibre optic systems, and the desire to
launch services as quickly as possible after 1998 means that many
operators will want off-the-shelf products. Although new deployment of
broadband infrastructure will provide growth in the short term, the
major opportunity for technology suppliers will be in developing and
enhancing products which support innovative new services.

Investment

Investment by utilities and other industrial companies has been a
feature of new network development, says Mr Knott, with a  third of the
total investment being contributed by them. Surprisingly, the finance
sector has contributed only around 15% of all direct investment,
although this figure excludes loans and other funding arrangements with
the companies making the investment in infrastructure. The chart on
page 10 estimates the spread of sources of finance for new UK
infrastructure covering the period 1991-1996.

A similar range of investors is already evident across the rest of
Europe, although a lack of data makes it impossible to assess the
relative financial contributions of each group. Major groups of
corporate investors include investment banks and similar institutions
(Telenet Vlaanderen, ISIS Multimedia), public and private sector
utilities (Telivo, EnterTel, etc.) and parent industrial companies
(Thyssen Telecom, Tele2, etc.).

North American investment is widespread across Europe. The initial wave
coincided with the licensing of independent mobile network operators.
This was followed by several regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs)
taking stakes in the cable TV sector in France, Spain and Scandinavia,
following their move into the UK cable market.  More recently this has
been followed by a wave of alliances with European partners seeking to
enter voice telephony markets, an example of this being the
collaboration between BellSouth and Thyssen.

STREAM "FLOUTS" ITALIAN CABLE TV RULES

Stream, the multimedia division of Italian state telecom holding
company Stet and its subsidiary Telecom Italia, has announced plans to
provide TV programming services over the broadband fibre-optic network
under construction by Telecom Italia, reports New Media Markets.

However, Stream's plans may be thwarted by the Italian government's
draft cable TV legislation which aims to prevent Telecom Italia
becoming a direct provider of broadcast-type TV services (Multimedia
Business Analyst, 1/23/3 and 2/1/1).

Stream hopes to begin offering a package of TV programming from
September over the hybrid fibre optic/coaxial cable network being
deployed by Telecom Italia. It plans to provide four cable TV channels,
two premium pay-per-view channels and a home shopping service.
Programming will cover films, music, documentaries and sport.
Stream claims to be an independent programming distributor and says
that, although initially it will provide programming over Telecom
Italia's broadband network, it will consider using other operators'
infrastructure - such as Videostrada, the Olivetti-US West joint
venture - when this becomes available. However, analysts are dubious
about the legal validity of Stream's argument, given that it is
assuming responsibility for packaging, pricing and marketing and that
Stream and Telecom Italia are part of the same organisation. Telecom
Italia is seen as trying to get round the proposed ban on its providing
entertainment services by using Stream.

By the autumn, when Stream's programming service will start, Telecom
Italia's broadband network should have reached 14 major cities, with
optical fibre in the trunk network and coaxial fibre running to the
home. By mid-1997 coverage should have been extended to 25-30 cities.
Assuming that optical fibre costs fall sufficiently over the next three
years, Telecom Italia hopes to start laying optical fibre to the home
by the end of 1998. It originally planned to deploy optical fibre to
10m homes by late 1998, but merchant bankers Robert Fleming Securities
says that it will achieve only a third of this number.

Stream launches VOD trial

Stream and Telecom Italia launched a commercial trial of VOD services
at the end of last month to 1,000 homes in Milan and Rome. The
Videomagic service runs over Telecom Italia infrastructure, initially
providing entertainment programmes, children's TV, local information
services and home shopping. Stream plans to launch the service
commercially in early 1997, making it available to Telecom Italia and
other broadband network operators.

Despite Telecom Italia's new policy of only using optical fibre for
multimedia services, Stream is using asymmetric digital subscriber line
(ADSL) technology in the Videomagic trial. Bell Atlantic is providing
equipment for the pilot, which follows a technical trial starting in
December 1994.

ITALIAN BANKS TO INVEST IN MEDIASET

Six Italian banks led by credit institute IMI have agreed to take a
combined 5.49% stake - worth L370bn ($233m) - in Mediaset, the newly-
formed TV and advertising arm of former Italian premier Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest media group. The banks also agreed to help with
the subsequent flotation of part of Mediaset with a preliminary
commitment to underwrite L1,025bn worth of shares.

Mr Berlusconi plans to reduce his family's stake in Mediaset to under
50% through public offerings on the Milan, London and New York stock
exchanges beginning in mid-1996.

State-owned BNL is considering becoming the seventh bank to invest in
Mediaset via its Albacom telecom joint venture with UK carrier BT.
Mediaset is known to be seeking a telecom company as a partner.
However, should BT consent to Albacom making this proposed L70bn
investment, it is unclear how it would affect rival Cable & Wireless
Europe's negotiations to use Fininvest's Italian TV transmission
network for fixed and wireless telecoms (Multimedia Business Analyst,
2/3/3).

A consortium of foreign investors including German media magnate Leo
Kirch, Prince al-Waheed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and a group
controlled by South African financier Johan Rupert already owns around
18% of Mediaset.

TWO WAY TV RAISES FUNDS FOR NATIONAL SERVICE

Two Way TV, the London-based company which launched a terrestrial
interactive TV service in Birmingham in November, is in the process of
raising #30m-#40m in new capital. It hopes to launch throughout the
Central Television area in the Midlands this spring followed by a
nationwide rollout during 1996.

Investors so far include Electra, Mercury Asset Management, Murray
Johnstone and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (Multimedia
Business Analyst, 2/3/2). The Two Way TV system broadcasts data and
graphics to accompany TV programmes via spare capacity on conventional
TV frequencies in the same way as teletext. Subscribers receive four
infra-red handsets and a Motorola set-top box equipped with a modem
which communicates their answers to interactive TV quizzes via a free
telephone connection to Two Way TV's server.
Two Way TV has reached agreement with all the UK's broadcasters to use
their programmes and receive copies in advance so that additional game
formats can be added by its staff.

Executive chairman Bill Andrewes, a former chairman of Granada's rental
and leisure divisions, says that initial market research suggests
consumers find the Two Way TV system attractive and that it increases
viewing in homes which subscribe. He is encouraged by the service's 8%
take-up rate in the Birmingham area, particularly as a planned TV
advertising campaign has yet to start.

NTT CLAIMS INFRARED PUBLISHING BREAKTHROUGH

Japanese telecom operator NTT has formed a strategic partnership with
TV Interactive Corp of the US to develop multimedia communications
services using infrared ray technology.

The TVIQ system enables television viewers to access online shopping
and other interactive TV services by touching text and graphics in
printed publications such as home-shopping catalogues, claims its
developer, Silicon Valley-based TV Interactive.

TV screens will display videos and music chosen by the user when a TV
set-top box, containing CD-based information, responds to infrared rays
emitted from chips embedded in the publication. The system is
particularly intended for consumers such as old people or housewives
who are unfamiliar or apprehensive about interactive technology.

NTT and TV Interactive plan to make their infrared technology an
industry standard by presenting it at a US meeting early this year of
IrDa, the infrared standards body. IrDa has recently standardised
infrared technology for short-distance communications between PCs and
peripherals such as printers, but has yet to begin research into
technology for longer-distance communications such as the TVIQ system.

NEW UK ELECTRONIC SHOPPING TRIAL PLANNED

This April sees the launch of Project SUMMON, an electronic shopping
trial involving 40 major UK retailers and service providers and managed
by Rickmansworth-based start-up Virtual Precincts Ltd.

Project SUMMON (Sales Using MultiMedia On Networks) will site a series
of multimedia kiosks in public places in west and north west London
during 1996. Each kiosk will house a virtual shopping mall in which the
trial participants will offer their wares for purchase by credit or
debit card. Around 100,000 members of the public are expected to use
the system during the lifetime of the trial.

Virtual Precincts' managing director Alan Leibert says that the mall is
not a 100% replica of a standard high street in order to reflect the
participation of mail order and direct-to-market companies as well as
local authorities.

London-based cable TV operator Videotron is supplying the 10Mbps
connections linking the kiosks to SUMMON's server. Data is delivered in
real-time from the central database, allowing the system to be used to
sell cinema, theatre and travel tickets. Towards the end of 1996,
Virtual Precincts intends to offer SUMMON over coax cable TV links to
set-top boxes in subscribers' homes, and is currently talking to a
number of possible equipment suppliers such as games console
manufacturers.

Mr Leibert says that unlike Cambridge Cable and BT's trials of
interactive TV-based shopping, SUMMON is based on open standards,
allowing participating retailers to reuse their "shops" on other
interactive systems. SUMMON's use of the Internet's TCP/IP protocol and
HTML language also means that, once sufficient bandwidth becomes
available, the service could be offered over the Internet, says Mr
Leibert.

Illustra, the US software company taken over by database giant Informix
just before Christmas, is supplying the multimedia relational database
technology for SUMMON. As the Illustra system is based on independent
data types, it is able to assemble HTML pages of information requested
by users "on the fly", says Mr Leibert.

Cambridge-based smart card specialist General Information Systems is
providing the secure payment environment, based on a secure "pipe"
running from each kiosk to a payment server sited alongside the main
server but in a physically secure area. The payment server is connected
to the acquirer and authorisation networks operated by the various card
companies participating in the trial. Once a purchase transaction is
completed, the kiosk prints a receipt for the customer.

Suppliers participating in the project can either set up electronic
links to their own fulfilment systems or take advantage of SUMMON's
fulfilment service.

Other technology companies involved in SUMMON include Glenlake which
designed the virtual mall environment; Point 4 Consulting which
supplied the Access/Register system to track activity at the kiosks;
ICL's kiosk manufacturing unit; and Silicon Graphics which supplied the
central server.

Mr Leibert, a veteran of the smart card industry, says that Virtual
Precincts has decided not to seek finance from the City because of the
short-term approach taken by many investors. Instead, it is seeking
long-term backing, possibly from an international network operator or
from one of its technology partners.

Aveiro (Portugal), Iceland and Basel (Switzerland).

The AMUSE (Advanced Multimedia Services for Residential Users) project
is under the banner of the ACTS Programme, part of the EC's Fourth
Framework R&D initiative. Each organisation will contribute its own
expertise to the project which will embrace all aspects of multimedia
delivery including set-top boxes, video servers, ATM switches, core and
access networks as well as content creation and service provision.

In addition to testing alternative access network technologies such as
hybrid-fibre-coax (HFC), passive optical networks (PON) and asymmetric
digital subscriber line (ADSL), AMUSE will examine the possibility of
delivering interactive services via broadband ISDN. It will also look
at issues such as delivery platform interoperability and user interface
design.

AMUSE's first phase will provide services such as video- and news-on-
demand, tele-travel agency and Internet access, followed by additional
services in its second phase such as home shopping and tele-games.
Prior to the start of the second phase, the performance of the delivery
platform will be upgraded to improve the picture quality of material
displayed on users' TV screens.

OECD CONFERENCE SEEKS ENCRYPTION COMPROMISE

International business and government representatives meeting in Paris
on 20 December reached a compromise which may lead to formal global
policy guidelines on the encryption of online networks being prepared
by the summer.

The meeting discussed the conditions under which governments seeking to
track illicit activity should be empowered to decode encrypted computer
transmissions, an issue of major concern to private and business
computer users and law enforcement agencies.

Although it had no formal legal authority, the forum, sponsored by the
International Chamber of Commerce and the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development, marked the first occasion that a large
number of delegates from governments, businesses and the IT industry
have gathered to discuss developments in encryption.

The forum agreed that controls should be kept to a minimum, consistent
with the requirements of law enforcement and national security. The
next step will be for governments to formulate guidelines for national
policies with a further joint business-governmental session to provide
private sector input scheduled for the first half of 1996.

The development of a global electronic commerce market on the Internet
potentially worth over $300bn has led to calls from computer companies
such as Microsoft and banks for the US government's strict controls
over the export of encryption algorithms to be relaxed.

Currently, only businesses based in the US have access to high-level
(128-bit) versions of Internet encryption software from companies such
as Netscape and Microsoft (Multimedia Business Analyst, 2/1/9-10). The
universal nature of the Internet means that any encryption software
governed by export regulations cannot legally be distributed online as
it risks being downloaded by users outside the US.

Law enforcement agencies are concerned that if highly secure encryption
technology is exported, it may fall into the hands of money launderers,
drug dealers and terrorists. They have therefore demanded the right to
hack into computer transmissions for counter-intelligence and criminal
investigation work in the same way that they are already able to tap
telephone conversations.

A significant feature of the Paris meeting was that business delegates
agreed in principle to allow such official access to take place as long
as sufficient safeguards are in place and "electronic search warrants"
are issued under due legal process. A number of governments appear
willing to permit relaxation of export controls on high-level
encryption devices as long as these safeguards are in place.

Among the issues which experts on both sides need to resolve are the
ways in which private software "keys" allowing computer transmissions
to be decoded would be handled. The US government's proposed solution -
the Clipper chip which would give its agencies "backdoor" access to
private keys while unauthorised keys would be outlawed - has been hotly
contested by both US computer users and industry players such as Apple,
AT&T, IBM and Microsoft.

The Council of Europe's similar proposal, dubbed Euro-Clipper, has been
rejected by major commercial users, such as investment bank J.P.
Morgan, which said they would take legal action against any move to
force them to use only approved encryption technologies.

However, a number of business organisations have backed the European
Commission's proposal to license trusted third-party escrow
organisations, which would be independent of government, would hold the
keys and would hand them over to government investigators when their
demands were justified. These could be telecom operators, postal
authorities or financial organisations with transaction expertise.

According to CommunicationsWeek International, the EC expects to adopt
a directive backing the use of trusted third parties for encryption in
the first quarter of 1996.

However, a number of critical issues need to be resolved such as how
such custodians could be made legally liable for any unauthorised
access to encrypted information and for the costs of its misuse. In the
hands of a totalitarian government, the legal power to hack into online
networks or to read encrypted data contained on computers or smart
cards could have very serious consequences.

Analysts warn that if governments do not ensure secure communications
in their countries and reasonable safeguards against unjustifed
official intrusion, international companies are likely to transfer
their operations elsewhere.

Moreover, a global solution to encryption is seen as essential.
Businesses view the prospect of a patchwork of different national legal
regimes governing encryption as highly undesirable, as this would
severely delay the advance of international electronic commerce over
the Internet.

NTT DEVELOPS SECURE E-CASH SYSTEM

NTT has developed a secure electronic cash system for smart cards and
Internet-based transactions, reports Reuter. Using very secure
encryption algorithms, the system allows users to transfer cash from
their bank accounts to smart cards after verification by the issuing
bank.

NTT researcher Mikio Suzuki said the Japanese telecom operator plans to
begin trials of the system with a number of major city banks in the
near future. These are expected to include Fuji Bank and Sakura Bank.

SEGA AND NISSHO IWAI ANNOUNCE ONLINE GAMES VENTURE

Video game console manufacturer Sega Enterprises and trading firm
Nissho Iwai Corp are to jointly launch an online video game service in
Japan this April. The service will allow users in different locations
to play the same game against each other using Sega's 32-bit consoles.

Sega will supply the game software, while Nissho will set up a host
computer and provide subscribers with modems. Last month, Nissho set up
a joint venture together with NTT and three other Japanese companies to
market modems for the new service. These will be sourced from US-based
Catapult Entertainment Inc, in which Nissho owns a small equity stake.
A spokesman said Nissho expects to sell 500,000 modems in Japan by the
end of 1996.

COMPUSERVE SUSPENDS ACCESS TO INTERNET NEWSGROUPS

CompuServe has temporarily suspended access to over 200 Internet
newsgroups following a threat of legal action by the German authorities
over illegal pornographic material available on some of the user
forums.

The move follows a raid on CompuServe's German offices during which
federal investigators examined computer equipment. It is believed to be
the first time an online service provider has restricted access to
newsgroups in response to threatened legal action.

A CompuServe spokesman said that the online service provider, which now
has 4m subscribers worldwide including 500,000 in Europe, has to comply
with the laws of the countries in which it operates. "However, laws in
different countries are often in conflict, and this creates challenges
unique to the online industry." CompuServe is now investigating ways in
which it can restrict user access to specific newsgroups by
geographical location, a capability which, like other service
providers, it currently lacks.

As an Internet access provider, CompuServe is not responsible for the
origination or nature of content on the Internet over which it has no
creative or editorial control, the spokesman stressed. Nevertheless,
its move to block access to certain newsgroups won it plaudits from
users, pressure groups and legislators concerned about the largely
unregulated content available on the Internet.

QUOTES FROM THE WAY AHEAD BY BILL GATES (VIKING)

* The benefits and problems arising from this upcoming communications
revolution will be much greater than those brought about by the PC
revolution.

* The information highway will extend the electronic marketplace and
make it the ultimate go-between, the universal middleman....This will
carry us into a new world of low-friction, low overhead, in which
market information will be plentiful and transaction costs low.  It
will be a shopper's heaven.

* Microsoft is investing more than $100m a year on research and
development for the highway.  It will almost certainly take five years
or more of this kind of investing before the results of the R&D bring
in enough revenue to make the money back, so we're making a $500m bet.
It could prove to be a half-billion dollar losing bet.

* The experience of poker strategising - and the money - were helpful
when I got into business....

* The building of the highway will be a learning process, and some
companies will lose their shirts....Gold rushes tend to encourage
impetuous investments.  A few will pay off, but when the frenzy is
behind us, we will look back incredulously at the wreckage of failed
ventures and wonder, "who funded those companies?  What was going on in
their minds?  Was that just mania at work?"

* Beware!  Mergers that are attempts to bring all aspects of highway
expertise into one organisation should be viewed
skeptically....Companies merging, or failing to merge, is no indication
of progress or the lack of it.

* Success is a lousy teacher.  It seduces smart people into thinking
they can't lose.  And it's an unreliable guide to the future.

* I used to date a woman who lived in a different city.  We spent a lot
of time together on e-mail....In the future this sort of "virtual
dating" could be better because the movie watching could be combined
with videoconferencing.

* First thing, as you come in(to my house), you'll be presented with an
electronic pin to clip to your clothes.  The electronic pin you wear
will tell the house who and where you are....Someday, instead of
needing the pin, it might be possible to have a camera system with
visual-recognition capabilities....The house will remember everything
it learns about your preferences.

* Some governments may insist that each (safe and encrypted) mailbox
have a second door with a separate key that the government keeps, but
we'll ignore that political consideration for now and concentrate on
the security that software will provide.

* What today seems like big brother might one day become the norm if
the alternative is being left to the mercy of terrorists and criminals.
 I am not advocating either position - technology will enable society
to make a political decision.

EUROPE ONLINE TO OFFER ACCESS TO T-ONLINE USERS

Europe Online finally launched its multilingual online service on 15
December, although teething problems meant potential subscribers had to
wait to this month for full access. In November it jettisoned AT&T's
proprietary Interchange platform in favour of open Internet standards
and Netscape Navigator.

The Luxembourg-based venture also announced a tie-up with Deutsche
Telekom which will provide the 1m subscribers to the telco's T-Online
German-language online service with "easy" access to Europe Online. T-
Online users subscribing to Europe Online will be also billed by
Deutsche Telekom.

Subject to approval by the EC and by Germany's cartel office, Deutsche
Telekom also plans to invest in the rival online service launched in
late November by America Online and Bertelsmann (Multimedia Business
Analyst, 2/5/3). By allying itself with Europe Online in addition to
AOL/Bertelsmann, Deutsche Telekom hopes to fend off any anti-trust
investigations.

GLOBAL MULTI-MEDIA INVESTMENT TRUST

London stockbrokers Raphael Zorn Hemsley in partnership with media
consultant John Scaife has announced a media fund investing exclusively
in film, TV, print publishing and multimedia stocks. First Media
Investment Trust plc will focus on companies creating, owning,
distributing or exploiting media assets and intellectual property. It
will however not invest in hardware companies or directly in media
titles. According to NatWest Securities, media stocks have been the
third-fastest-growing sector of the UK stock market since 1973.

To be floated on the Stock Exchange at the end of January, First Media
aims to place between 40m and 100m #1 ordinary shares, with warrants
attached, which will be used to buy stakes in quoted and unquoted media
companies around the world. Mr Scaife, a former head of the European
media and telecom team at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, expects
the trust to raise more than #50m at flotation, given the commitments
he has already received from a number of institutional investors. The
UK already has another specialist media investment trust, Herald
Investment Trust plc. Set up two years ago by Rutherford Asset
Management to handle smaller quoted companies with market
capitalisations under #300m, Herald raised #65m at flotation from 120
institutional investors (Multimedia Business Analyst, 1/14/12-13).
First Media, by contrast, is seeking to invest 30% of its assets in
unquoted companies within a two-year period. It is targeting
institutional investors, although small investors will be able to own
shares at the outset.

Initially, 40% of First Media's portfolio will be in the US, with the
remainder spread throughout Europe, although it may expand into
emerging markets. It will invest 35% of its portfolio in computer games
and interactive multimedia stocks; 25% in cable and broadcast TV
companies including listed conglomerates such as Viacom and Pearson;
15% in film and TV producers; 10% in multimedia publishing support
services such as 3D graphics; 5% in book and print publishing,
particularly with CD-ROM tie-ups; and 10% in Internet companies,
expected to be the growth stocks of the next century.

The initial net asset value of the trust will be 97% of net proceeds. A
1.5% annual management fee will apply, plus a 0.5% premium on dealings
in unquoted stocks. For details, contact Michael Rosenberg on +44
(0)171 628 4000.

Software Publisher Salaries On The Rise, According To SPA Survey 


Software publisher salaries are on the rise, according to a recent survey
conducted by the Software Publishers Association.

The SPA's Software Industry Salary Survey 1995 reported that the average
managerial salary increased 7.3% and the average non-managerial salary rose
6.9% in 1995 compared with 1994.  The average salary for all software
publishers is expected to increase 6.6% in 1996.

Companies surveyed publish software as a primary or secondary business.  Among
the 197 publishers surveyed are Acclaim Entertainment, Edmark, Sanctuary
Woods, Grolier Electronic Publishing and Headbone Interactive.

The managerial position salary that increased the most was international
director of sales -- up 16.7% to $72,900.

Smaller Company Salaries Increasing Faster

The survey also broke publishers down into four revenue categories:  below
$500,000; $500,000 to $3 million; $3 million to $25 million; and above $25
million.

Companies with revenues between $500,000 and $3 million increased managerial
salaries 8.5% in 1995, the largest increase of the four revenue groups.  The
largest projected increase for 1996 managerial salaries was 9.2% for companies
with less than $500,000 in revenues.

Publishers with revenues of less than $500,000 posted the largest increase in
salary for non-managerial employees -- 7.8%.

The SPA Software Industry Salary Survey 1995 is free to SPA full members.  It
is priced at $500 for non-SPA members.  For more information, contact the SPA
at (202) 452-1600.

Bill Gates' "Other Company" Licensing Digital Images


All title publishers know about Microsoft.  But few know of Bill Gates' other
company -- yet.

Corbis Corp.  (previously known as Continuum) was formed by Gates in 1989.
The company is collecting rights to intellectual property, including images
from the Bettmann Archive and the State Russian Museum.

In January 1995, the company formed Corbis Media specifically to license
Corbis-owned digital images to multimedia CD ROM publishers.  Corbis images
are available in subject areas including:  the arts; biography & portraits;
history; natural & life sciences; people & cultures; political & social
issues; sports; and physical & life sciences.

The Bellevue, WA-based company can provide publishers with images within 24 to
48 hours in most cases, Mark Daniel, Corbis manager of sales, told MBR.
Images can be sent on CD ROM or via online.  Corbis Media has approximately
150 employees.

Price -- $79 to $400 Per Image

Licensing the rights to one image ranges in price from $79 to $400, depending
on how the image will be used and the total number of images being licensed.

Among Corbis Media's customers are Questar Microsystems and Future Vision,
which was recently acquired by SoftKey International (MBR, 7/21/95).

A Lot Of Money To Pay Back

Corbis Media had "significant revenues" in 1995, according to Daniel, although
he wouldn't go into detail.

Acquiring rights to all of the images Corbis owns was expensive, Daniel
admitted.  It will take Corbis a number of successful years to recoup those
investments.

Corbis Media Contact

Contact:  For more information on licensing the rights to digital images from
Corbis Media, contact Mark Daniel, manager of sales, at (206) 649-3383 or
markd@corbis.com.

E3 vs. CES Orlando Highlights First Half Of 1996 Conferences


The long-awaited battle between Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and CES
Orlando (formerly the Summer Consumer Electronics Show) highlights 17
conferences planned for the first half of 1996, according to MBR's Conference
Planner.

Both E3 and CES Orlando focus on the retail market for electronic/interactive
products.  E3 was launched in 1995 by Knowledge Industry Publications and
Infotainment World.  Much of its success stemmed from the fact that the
Electronic Industries Association (EIA) did not hold Summer CES last year.
EIA revamped the show and renamed it CES Orlando.

This year, the two competing shows will be held within a week of each other --
E3 will be held May 16-18 at the Los Angeles Convention Center and CES Orlando
May 23-25 at the Orange City Convention Center in Orlando, FL.  E3 is
projecting 40,000 attendees and CES Orlando 30,000.

Attendance To Average 4000 Per Show

Attendance at the 17 shows will range from as few as 75 for the Institute for
International Research's Intelligent Set-top Box conference up to 80,000 for
the NAB's MultiMedia World show and EIA's Winter CES.  On average, 4000 people
will attend each show.

Exhibitor rates average $26/square foot -- about $2.75/square foot less than
last year.  Attendance fees average $1200 per show, ranging from free for both
CES Orlando and Winter CES to $1995 for Demo '96.

COMPUSERVE FORCED TO CENSOR

Officials at CompuServe Inc. scrambled last week to devise a way
to allow its 4 million members to regain access to more than 200
sexually explicit Internet newsgroups.  On Dec. 28, in response
to an order by the government of Germany, CompuServe suspended
access from its service to the controversial newsgroups,
spokeswoman Daphne Kent said.  German law enforcement told the
world's second-largest online service that the content of the
newsgroups was illegal under German law.

CompuServe subscribers worldwide, not just in Germany, are
affected by the action.  Kent would not speculate as to when, or
even if, access would be restored but said the company is "always
concerned" that blocking access to information could cost it
customers.  Kent said no other online service was similarly
restricted and said "we were likely targeted because of our
size."  Although smaller than its chief competitor, America
Online Inc.,  CompuServe has the greatest overseas presence of
any consumer online service.  In Germany it claims 100,000
members.  The number is insignificant, though, in comparison to
the more than 1.8 million individuals who use the Internet in
Germany and whose access to the same newsgroups is harder to
restrict, depending upon their method of access.

Kent said CompuServe is "looking at several options," among them
implementing a system that would restrict access to newsgroups by
region of the world and a "software solution" customized to abide
by each country's laws.

2MARKET, 2MARKET TO FIND A GREAT SALE

If fighting the post-holiday crowds in search of sales in the
shopping malls is not your idea of a bargain, perhaps 2Market
Inc.'s merchants' offering of after-Christmas merchandise online
is more what you had in mind.  A special sales area began Dec. 26
to give 2Market customers reduced prices at Greet Street
(greeting cards), Eddie Bauer (home and apparel), Chef's Catalog
(kitchen ware) and Windham Hill (holiday music CDs).  Access is
through the Marketplace area on America Online Inc. (AOL) or on
2Market's Holiday Edition CD-ROM.

Other merchants are expected to begin offering sale merchandise
through 2Market.  Valentine gifts will be available by the middle
of this month.  "Customers who may have waited in the past for
sale catalogs or a clearance sale at a retailer can now turn to
2Market for even more value and convenience," commented Tom Burt,
president and CEO of 2Market.

2Market's combination of CD-ROM and online technologies makes it
possible for shoppers with the CD-ROM (MMD 5/25/95) to connect
automatically to AOL, tap the online messages and receive price
updates, new products, special promotions and other vendor
information.  A professional gift expert is available to assist
with gift selections.  A CD-ROM can be ordered by calling 
1-800-622-6600 or from the 2Market area on AOL.  (2Market

SOFTKEY, LEARNING SAGA COMES TO CLOSE

After months of controversy, haggling, threats and lawsuits,
SoftKey International Inc. finally has completed its acquisition
of The Learning Co. pursuant to a merger agreement signed by the
two companies in early December (MMD 12/8/95).  Approximately 95
percent of the outstanding shares of Learning stock, or 7.7
million shares, were purchased for $67.50 per share in cash as
payment for the company on Dec. 22, and the merger of Learning
into a wholly owned subsidiary of SoftKey was completed late last
Wednesday.

Learning originally had resisted SoftKey's courtship - which
began last October with a cash-and-stock offer worth $606 million
(MMD 10/31/95) - because it already was in merger talks with
Broderbund Software Inc., but also because Learning felt it would
not be able to realize its full market potential under ownership
by SoftKey, a company in whose business philosophy it had little
faith.  But money talks, and a sweetened offer by SoftKey (MMD
12/5/95) led Learning's board of directors to change their tune
and accept the new bid.

SoftKey also has closed a previously announced deal with Tribune
Co. to merge the latter's Compton's NewMedia Inc. and Compton's
Learning Company (different from The Learning Co.) units into
SoftKey (MMD 12/1/95).  As part of the deal, SoftKey last week
tendered 4.5 million shares of its common stock in exchange for
both Compton's companies, which now operate as wholly owned
subsidiaries.  SoftKey also issued 587,036 additional shares to
Tribune last Thursday to cancel $14 million of intercompany debt,
and also executed a promissory note to cancel $3 million of such
debt.

AOL, COMPUSERVE:  5M IN EARLY 1996

Amrica Online Inc. (AOL) announced last week that its number of
subscribers has surpassed 4.5 million.  The announcement came
less than a week after CompuServe Inc. announced that it now has
4 million subscribers.  Both companies said they expect to be
serving 5 million subscribers in the near future - AOL "early in
the new year," and CompuServe "next spring."

"New computer owners are realizing the value of the online
service and the Internet," said Bob Massey, CompuServe's
president and CEO.  "A computer that is not connected to
cyberspace is like a television without sound and color." 
CompuServe said it is adding 200,000 new members to its service
every month.

AOL, for its part, has tripled its subscribership since a year
ago, when it had just over 1.5 million members.  "Not only are
consumers in the United States showing a strong preference for
AOL as their means of access to the Internet and the world of
online services, but initial response to GNN, our new Internet-
only service ... has been gratifying," said Steve Case, chairman
and CEO of the company.

Although AOL has a larger subscriber base in the United States,
CompuServe has a larger international base.  Last month,
CompuServe announced that it had reached the 500,000 subscriber
mark in Europe (MMD 12/22/95), and that it intends to double that
number in the next year.  But AOL is expanding internationally as
well.  In late November it launched service in Germany in
partnership with Bertelsmann AG (MMD 11/29/95), and intends to
take France, the United Kingdom and Japan online during 1996.

DAVIC ADOPTS GLOBAL STANDARDS

The Digital Audio-Visual Council (DAVIC) has finalized its first
set of global technical standards for "end-to-end" digital
multimedia systems and now will focus on adding specifications
for cable modems.  In the future, DAVIC will tackle the
development of standards for video servers, 3-D animation, high-
quality video and sound, and network interfaces in the home, a
DAVIC spokesman said.

The new "DAVIC 1.0" standards, which allow for content and
hardware interoperability, were adopted Dec. 16 in Berlin at the
end of a weeklong series of meetings involving about 400 DAVIC
representatives.  The International Telecommunication Union is
expected to ratify the standards this month.      DAVIC is a
coalition of communications and entertainment companies that is
creating voluntary standards for digital audio and visual
services.  Council officials said earlier this year that the
first set of standards would be adopted in December (MMD
9/19/95).

The new standards will enable equipment manufacturers to develop
network hardware without having to worry about whether their
product conforms to proprietary standards, the spokesman said. 
In addition, programmers will be able to convert existing content
- or develop new content - according to uniform specifications
for digital systems.  The spokesman emphasized that the DAVIC
standards process will be an "ongoing" effort, with additional
specifications incorporated periodically into the standards.  The
council's "highest priority" now is to develop cable modem
specifications for "DAVIC 1.1," he said.  DAVIC is working in
conjunction with Cable Television Laboratories Inc. to develop
those specifications.

In the coming months, DAVIC also plans to develop specifications
for Internet access, system security, return channels for
satellite TV transmission, and "modulation schemes" for wireless
cable TV service, the spokesman said.  Such specifications would
be added as "building blocks" to existing DAVIC standards, he
stressed.  DAVIC's next meetings will be held in Seoul, South
Korea, in March and New York City in June.  In addition, a
special May meeting is being planned to discuss "more rapid
consideration of [cable] modems," the spokesman said.

NEWS IN BRIEF

New York City was the place to be for cybergeeks on New Year's
Eve.  Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) hosted a party
at Club Expo in Manhattan, featuring a Sony PlayStation
competition that let partygoers play new video games and compete
for prizes.  The bash was broadcast by the city's 102.7 WNEW-FM
radio station and occasionally simulcast on Sony's Jumbotron
screen in Times Square - where Total New York Inc. and Pipeline
New York were hosting their own party - "the wildest online party
yet" - on Total's Web site.  Parties in Times Square and the
Knitting Factory ("the only club in New York with a live T1
connection") were "cybercast" on http://www.totalny.com and
hosted by Aliza "Cybergrrl" Sherman.  (Sony 415-655-8047; Total
212-620-6100)

In a newly published book - Bill Gates: The Robber Baron of
Cyberspace - author Anthony Martin, executive director of the
Committee to Fight Microsoft Corp., provides an antidote to
Gates' vision of the future (MMD 11/29/95).  "Gates' world is one
in which ordinary Americans are monitored relentlessly," said
Martin at a press conference last week.  "My book ... exposes the
truth behind Microsoft Corp. and its drug-crazed culture....  Mr.
Gates may have fooled some of the people some of the time, but he
will not be allowed to fool all of the people all of the time." 
That's tellin' 'em!  (Martin 212-879-0086)

At first it looked as if the computers would win, but on Day 2 of
the Harvard Cup Human Versus Computer Chess Challenge the humans
staged a comeback and grandmasters Joel Benjamin and Michael
Rhode emerged victorious.  The top-scoring computer games were I-
Motion Interactive's "Virtual Chess" and "Chessmaster 4000 for
Windows 95" from Mindscape Inc., the principal sponsor of the
competition.  (Mindscape 305-321-6334)

Demand for 16-bit video games and video game players was greater
this holiday season than it was for the newer 32-bit platforms,
according to the Wall Street Journal.  Executives from companies
such as Nintendo of America Inc. and Sega of America Inc. were
quoted as admitting they could have done more to prepare for what
could have been a windfall season for them, had they not run out
of 16-bit products.  It seems the newer games simply couldn't
compete with the price and installed base of 16-bit machines.  Go
figure.  (Sega 213-782-6600, http://www.segaoa.com; Nintendo
213-623-4200, http://www.nintendo.com)

      CENTREGOLD AND SEGA SEE SHORT FUTURE FOR CARTRIDGES

Centregold has issued a trading statement blaming a 23% decline
on lean demand for 16-bit cartridges but it said larger companies
such as Sega have suffered even greater losses.

Centregold Plc's trading statement on the six months to January
31 said the company's turnover had dropped 23% to GBP41m, leading
to a pre-tax loss of GBP3.6m, GBP2.9m of which came from stock
provisions.

Geoff Brown, Centregold's chief executive, believes his
announcement is the visible tip of a much larger iceberg,
claiming Sega Enterprises Ltd dropped 2m units before Christmas.
"Anything sold below GBP29.99 was sold below cost," he said.

Sega could not confirm losses but did admit that market response
had presented problems for the company recently. Mark Maslowicz,
Sega's UK software manager, said the delays would give cartridges
a life of little more than two years.

Centregold operates from US, UK, France, Germany and Japan,
incorporating publishers US Gold and Core Design, the budget
software label, KIXX, and the software research and development
company, Silicon Dreams, which has exclusive rights to the
Olympics '96.

Following the statement, Brown said the lack of dynamism in the
games cartridge industry could force it to give way to CD-ROM.

According to Brown, the three months it takes to order, assemble
and distribute games cartridges means that players cannot respond
to the upswing or inertia of the market. As a result, businesses
may fail to supply an eager market in time or have shelves piled
with unwanted products. "You put your finger in the air," he
said, "and see how it goes."

The company's San Francisco outlet has taken the largest hit and
is already moving towards PC CD-ROM, which takes one to two weeks
to get onto the shelves giving a high, cheap turnover for a near-
guaranteed market.

The lack of dynamics in the market has meant that promises of 64-
bit machines has kept customers waiting for their next purchase.
As one observer asked, "would you buy a TV today if you knew a 3D
TV was going to be out next year?"

Centregold had GBP430,000 in 16-bit machines on the books at the
end of last year and has been forced to drop its sell-on price
from GBP17 to GBP5 to shift GBP350,000 since then.

Analysts say they had been expecting losses for some time
although broker firm Smith New Court still predicts profits in
1996. Durlacher believes the time to earnings is closer to three
years and investments should not be earnings-based for at least
12-18 months.

Centregold's Geoff Brown believes the company has come out
"unscathed" but this year he is setting his sights on selling
40,000 units of the company's new football title, Fever Pitch,
compared with sales of 300,000 units of the World Cup cartridge
last year.

"In about two years the money made on CDs will exceed the money
made on cartridges," he said. "Admittedly, CD drives cost more
but cartridges cost more than CDs. In an ideal world everything
would be on CD."

Centregold's Geoff Brown sees the cartridge waning in
manufacturers' popularity. "16-bit cartridge is dead," he said.
"We've two more products then we'll leave it."

          INTEL SPELLS OUT NEW COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
                  TO DODGE HESITANT AUTHORITIES

As the US vice president vows to open telecoms markets, Intel
executives have warned that Europe's restrictive telecoms
legislation will motivate computer users to open new
communications pathways via the Internet.

In an exclusive interview with Multimedia Futures, Claude
Leglise, Intel Corp's worldwide director of multimedia, warned
that citizens would soon find new ways of communicating if
governments continued to avoid deregulation of the telecoms
networks.

Vice President Al Gore told ministers at the Group of Seven
information technology conference on February 25, "whether by new
law or new legislation we intend to open foreign investment in
telecommunications services in the United States."

The statement was backed by AT&T chief executive, Robert Allen,
who said, "if the dominant telecoms operators of Europe are to
become self-sufficient, profitable companies, they need the
stimulus of a truly competitive market.

According to Leglise, high charges for ISDN lines are "an
artefact of government regulation". He highlighted the difference
between the computer business and the telecoms business as one in
which the first is impatient to find new ways to expand, the
other loaded with legislation.

"One is right," he said, "the other is... not right."
"Deregulation of communications services is what will make this
thing grow. In North America the cable companies want to get into
the phone business and the phone companies want to get into the
video business. If none of these guys do anything, let me propose
that the computer industry and the computer users will start
creating their own (telecoms) network using Internet."

February saw the birth of at least two Internet telephone
companies: VocalTec Inc in tel Aviv, Israel (mf issue 2) and
Electric Magic Co in San Francisco (mf issue 3). Digital
Equipment Corporation has also said it will market its own
Internet phone by June and Cirrus Logic Inc has expressed an
interest in licensing VocalTec's software.

Although the software is still in its early stages, Leglise said
it is only a matter of a few years before the Internet, with an
infrastructure already laid and waiting for the innovation,
becomes a cheap alternative to the telephone companies.

He is critical of authorities for not responding to the
situation. "There was a time when the buggy manufacturers were
not worried about cars. It took 25 years but ultimately they
should have been worried" he said. "There's a large history of
small companies that became big. Intel is one of them, Microsoft
is another. What I'm saying is, it's pretty much inevitable."

"The question really is will the authorities provide a framework
that will make it happen quickly or not. What they can influence
is really the pace, but not the outcome."

             BERTLESMANN BATTLES MICROSOFT NETWORK

In a bid to pre-empt Microsoft Network, Frankfurt, Germany-based
media giant, Bertelsmann AG has paid $50m for a 5% stake in
America Online.

Bertelsmann has an option to increase its stake to 10% of the
Reston, Virginia-based company  while both will set up an
equally-owned European online joint venture. The target is 1m
subscribers  and $685m annual turnover by 2000. The new service
is planned to begin in Frankfurt in six weeks.

The companies are inviting  would-be European partners, at least
one per country to take small stakes of not more than 10% in the
new venture.

       VIEWCALL SEEKS GBP700,000 FOR FRACTAL STILL VIDEO

Interactive Online system provider, Viewcall Europe Plc of
London, wants to raise GBP700,000 via an offer of shares for
subscription and will apply to trade its stock on the London
Stock Exchange under Rule 4.2.

Viewcall was established at the end of last year and is currently
the sole licensee of the Viewcall interactive on-line system,
which uses fractal compression at the host end.

If it raises the GBP700,000 it wants, it will be capitalised at
GBP4.8m. Rule 4.2 allows a company to be traded on a matched
bargain basis with no fixed price or market maker for shares. The
fractal technology the company uses has been pioneered by Walzer
Corp of Jersey over the past two years.

Viewcall will use the money raised to fund trials of its end to
end system that enables VHS quality still pictures to be passed
across the telephone network at speeds that make it fast enough
for on-line catalogue shopping, for example. The set-top box
decoder in the home then decompresses those images for the
customer.

The decision on the location of the trial will be made in the
next six to eight weeks from a shortlist of three locations and
should be live in the third or early fourth quarter. Walzer
currently holds the largest stake in Viewcall and shareholders
number around 50; broker is London-based Astaire & Partners Ltd.

The company has yet to confirm details of the manufacturer of the
systems and is holding back information on the details of the
hardware and software until this is finalised.

            TOSHIBA LAUNCHES 32-BIT R3900 RISC CORE
                 FOR SET-TOPS AND HAND-HELD PDAs

Toshiba America Components Inc has launched a 32-bit R3900 RISC
processor core for applications such as television set-top boxes
and Personal Digital Assistants, claiming it achieves R4000-class
performance with 52.5 Dhrystone MIPS and power dissipation of
about 400mW at 50MHz.

The company has also built the core which it makes under licence
from MIPS Technologies Inc, into Southern Cross, which it
describes as a stand-alone microprocessor that enables users to
evaluate the R3900 and shorten time-to-market.

The 3900 offers variable instruction cache and data cache sizes
and parameters and includes on-board power management functions.
The part is also aimed at multimedia applications, facsimile
modems, games, laser printer controllers and X-terminals.

The R3900 is the first RISC microprocessor that was fully
specified by the Toshiba San Jose facility and was jointly
designed with Toshiba's engineering facility in Kawasaki.

The engineers took the standard R3000 architecture and designed
it into a 26 square millimetre part with 4Kb instruction and 1Kb
data cache, giving it the MIPS I+ enhanced instruction set and a
modified five-stage pipeline structure.

The set adds built-in branch-likely instructions that eliminate
the no operation instructions from the program flow for more
compact code, and there is a built-in one-cycle Multiplier and
Accumulation operation to reduce the multiplication and addition
functions into a single operation to provide signal processor-
like functions to enhances graphics and communications
capabilities.

The part runs off a 3.3V supply. Green Hills Software Inc will
supply C/C++ compiler, assembler, linker, library tools and
debugger and Hewlett-Packard Co is helping Toshiba with an on-
chip software debug module.

Samples of the Southern Cross - the TMPR3901F - will be offered
later in May, with volume set for the third quarter. Toshiba is
expecting processor prices to be $30 in 1,000-up quantities.

          THRUGLASS FOLLOWS FAO SCHWARZ WITH FACTURA

Following its success with FAO Schwarz, MicroTouch Systems Inc
has acquired the information kiosk housings maker, Factura
Composites Inc of Rochester, New York, on undisclosed terms.

The success of the New York toy store's multimedia touch
sensitive window display at Christmas prompted FAO Schwarz to
introduce trials of  Methuen, Massachusetts-based Microtouch
Systems Inc's Thruglass product in seven of its flagship stores
in the US.

Schwarz customers were able to touch, through 2" thick glass, a
picture of a toy that interested them and set off a digital video
demonstration of that toy on a 20" monitor.

This "kiosk through glass" system, the Targa Windowshopper, was
developed by Berlin, Connecticut-based Targa Systems Corp, and is
based on a Toshiba multimedia PC and Methuen, Massassechusetts-
based Microtouch's projected capacitive technology which enables
proprietary sensors to project  a low-voltage field through glass
or any other non-conductive material. Thruglass TouchPads - three
different sizes from 1" by 1" to 4" by 3" - can be affixed to the
back of photos or graphics  on the inside of a store window.

When a person outside touches the glass minute changes in the
voltage field are detected by the Thruglass controller, which
passes the selection to the computer. Sound is also available
with the system as is a sixteen pad keyboard.

The beauty of the system is its low-cost - just $500 for the
Thruglass equipment - to which must be added the price of a 486
PC and authoring software to develop a demonstration.

                CNET CELEBRATES DIAMOND JUBILEE
                WITH FIBRE-OPTIC 140Mbps ATM LINK

The Centre National d'Etudes des Telecommunications (CNET)
France's $500m national research giant, celebrated its fiftieth
anniversary in Paris by demonstrating France's Telecom's first
140Mbps fibre optic point-to-point Asynchronous Transfer link
with Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG's CNET equivalent in
Darmstadt.

CNET announced its research targets over the next five years will
be technologies that will affect "planet telecommunications"
Asynchronous Transfer Mode - a technology it pioneered -
multimedia services, whether they be revamped PC versions of
Minitel or interactive cable television systems, mobile systems
and intelligent agents for filtering data from mobile or fixed
on-line services.

It is currently working to upgrade its Minitel viewdata services
for mail order, medical services, tourism, encyclopaedic and
educational sectors in France.

Michel Feneyrol, director of CNET said: "Between 26% and 30% of
the services we have now will be interested in having images
added and in more sophisticated, multimedia version of their
services."

Services using fixed images will appear on personal computers
between now and 2000, while services with moving images on
personal computers or televisions will appear by the turn of the
century, he added.

CNET and the national telecomms provider France Telecom, are
focusing on developing new on-line services and systems for
billing and network access, which they have perfected in 10 years
through operating the Minitel viewdata system.

Overall, Feneyrol believes that CNET will most probably
concentrate its R&D in software because "we see productivity with
software engineering tools growing much more slowly than, say,
the capacity of fibre optics".

France Telecom demonstrated the results of its partnership with
General Magic Inc on the use of intelligent agents to improve
user interfaces for telematic services.

"Our strategy, with General Magic is to add the nomadic dimension
to Teletel," said Jacques Guichard, associate director at CNET in
charge of multimedia.

The first market experiments using intelligent agents are
scheduled for next year. The applications, using personal
communicators from Sony Corp and Motorola Inc., are being
developed by France Telecom, General magic Inc and Philips PACE.
Gateways enable the communicators to interrogate existing Teletel
databases such as those of the national railway and highway
authorities.

Many of the CNET's development projects are currently being
exhibited as part of the 50th anniversary celebration, at the
Science City in Parc de la Villette, Paris until May 28.

         WHIRLPOOL DEMOS COOK-ON-DEMAND VOICE KITCHEN

The 'kitchen of the future' will cook on demand when Whirlpool
installs Voice Powered Technology's VoiceLogic technology in
kitchen applicances, but it will not allow you to shout at it.

The KitchenAid division of Whirlpool Corp has demonstrated speech
recognition in an oven, a refrigerator, a dishwasher and a
washing machine at the National Association of Home Builders
annual convention in Houston, Texas.

Whirlpool is currently reviewing the possibilities of using the
speech recognition technology from Canoga Park, California-based
Voice Powered Technology Inc. Whirlpool will not set a date for
KitchenAid Voice Command products to hit the shops until it has
fully evaluated the potential demand.

Speech recognition is about 97% accurate but still requires users
to press a button before speaking the commands. Voice Powered
Technology said there is still no reliable method for removing
background noise from the audio input.

"You can't just go into a room and yell at it," said a
spokesperson.

The system requires a short training session by each 'kitchen
user' who speaks around 30 words into the microphone. Then, in
the case of an oven, cooks can speak keywords like "prime rib",
"eight pounds" and "six pm", leaving the calculations to the
appliance.

Voice Powered Technology said it has been "looking to license to
home products for some time". A ten year old company with
revenues of $3.8m, it reported restructure losses of $290,000 in
December 1994 against a 1993 loss of $3.1m .

The company signed an OEM deal with Kong Wah Video Co Ltd in
April 1993. Kong Wah Video will use the technology in its Voice
Wand, a television remote control that operates with speech.
It has two other speech products: VCR Voice Programmer and Voice
Organizer, which retail at $99 and $199 respectively.

               AMERITECH WIRES 6M WITHOUT TRIALS

Interactive television is well known enough to install without
trials, according to DEC, which is supplying Alpha-based servers
to Ameritech's installation of 6m homes in Chicago.

Chicago-based Baby Bell, Ameritech Corp awarded the $475m
contract jointly to Digital Equipment Corp, Scientific Atlanta
Inc and ADC Telecommunications Inc and Ameritech is planning to
connect up to 300,000 homes in its five largest cities
immediately, rising to 1m by the end of the year. The company
hopes to have 6m - almost half the company's 13m subscribers -
using interactive television by 2001.

It is usual for companies to install a small number, often less
than 3000, to test the technology and marketing prospects of
interactive television in the area.

DEC said the technology was so well known now that it made little
sense to meander into the technology, particularly as the cabling
infrastructure had to be upgraded anyway.

"There's nothing really substantial to be gained from a trial,"
said a spokesperson. "Ameritech and other regional Bell companies
are already spending billions on new infrastructure. They might
as well go right ahead and install media servers."

The contract is worth $40m to Digital and $400m to Scientific
Atlanta which will supply analogue and digital set-top terminals
and remote controls. The remaining balance went to ADC
Telecommunications which got a six-year contract worth up to $35m
for cabinets placed in neighbourhoods to house the link between
the fibre-optic network and coaxial cables running to
subscribers' homes.

Nynex Corp, which is also using DEC and Scientific Atlanta, is
playing safer with a 2,500 installation in three apartment blocks
on Manhattan Island.

The company plans to expand quickly now that it has Federal
Communications Commission approval. It said it does not consider
Manhattan to be a trial but a starting point.

Nynex recently won its application for trading video services
within its own catchment area under the FCC rule 2.14 (mf issue
2). The rule has allowed telephone companies to supply video
services to their own telephone customers since 1992 providing
they obtain permission from the FCC.

DEC also said that even though the technology was solid enough to
build an infrastructure straight off, there were still
developments to be made that would bring the cost of installation
down.

"It's not as if there's no more innovation to go. It's just a
question of cost-reducing innovation," said the company's
spokesperson.

                   INFOMERCIALS DEBUT IN UK

Infomercials have begun in Europe for the first time as UK
companies fight for growing advertising revenues and Carlton
secures Children's ITV as its first customer for the SpotPlus
interactive commercial.

Carlton TV, part of Carlton Communications, is the UK's largest
independent television company since it bought Birmingham's
Central TV less than a year ago. Carlton hopes the initiative can
keep it ahead of Granada TV, the UK's number two. Advertising
revenues are forecast by to grow 6% this year.

Infomercials have been operating in the US for two years now by
television companies such as CBS and this is the first
introduction to Europe.

SpotPlus is a way for advertisers to add more information about a
product by screening extended details at 5.30 in the morning. A
number is displayed with the main advert and, by keying this
number into a VideoPlus remote control, the viewer sets their
video recorder to record the early morning commercial
when air-time costs are at their lowest.

SpotPlus infomercials cost GBP9,000 for the three and a half
minute slot compared with up to GBP1m in prime-time.

Children's ITV Interactive magazine (CITV), an interactive
television programme, is the first advertiser to make use of the
infomercial slot, which has been on trial since November last
year. The extended portion of the commercial will demonstrate how
to access the programme using a PC and a modem and offers a
chance to win a Compaq Presario 520.

Martin Bowley, managing director of sales at Carlton UK, sees
this as an opportunity for companies such as travel firms and car
manufacturers to use prime-time advertising space for brief
commercials which will include pointers to more in-depth
information.

            NTL PROMISES TERRESTRIAL DIGITAL TV ON
                 CONVENTIONAL SETS IN UK BY 1997

NTL, claiming the world's most ambitious terrestrial broadcasting
project, is promising UK viewers 12 digital channels using normal
television sets and aerials by 1997.

National Transcommunications Ltd was the engineering arm of
Independent Television (ITV) before being privatised in 1991 and
currently has a turnover of around GBP115m. It claims 30% of the
world market for video compression products other than
transmission equipment.

Based on MPEG-2 video compression, digital television is claimed
to improve the quality of broadcast signals and permit television
companies to offer services such as interactive programming and
wide screen TV. The broadcast quality of digital television
enables television to compete more equally with cable and
satellite.

NTL said the digital system will adhere to normal television
equipment as much as possible, adding a GBP300 set-top unit to
decode the digital signals to a conventional stereo PAL colour TV
signal. It expects the project to cost "tens of millions" of
pounds.

The digital broadcast started at the end of February on
757.25MHz, known as UHF Channel 34, carrying four additional
programmes in digital format in place of the normal PAL channel.

Reuters reports that NTL's plans throw down the gauntlet to the
UK government and its state-funded British Broadcasting
Corporation. In its June 1994 White Paper, the government linked
the introduction of digital broadcasting to the privatisation of
the BBC transmission network.

NTL does not want to be relegated to second place because of
delays in broadcast legislation, causing it to lose leverage
against cable companies, already in reach of 4.4m homes in the
UK.

"Above all, we ask that the BBC must not be given a favoured
position," said NTL chief executive, Andy Sukawaty.

NTL has already offered to provide digital transmission of the
BBC's channels and is waiting its reply. It has already expressed
an interest in buying the BBC's transmission arm when it is
privatised, claiming it could make savings of up to #20m by
combining the assets of the two companies.

Digital transmission could bring back Channel Five, a station
which was to use channel 35 in the TV spectrum but was rejected
by the broadcasting industry because companies licensing the
channel would have to pay several million of pounds to convert or
re-tune customer's VCRs.

The reintroduction of Channel Five could improve the chances of
regional and minority broadcasts.

           UNIONS THREATEN GERMAN TELECOMS EXPANSION

German unions have threatened strike action if Deutsche Telekom's
modernisation continues to threaten jobs, even if it means
damping down the country's telecommunications explosion.

The German public telecommunications operator is planning to
install six interactive television trials in Berlin, Hamburg,
Koln, Leibzig, Neurenberg and Stuttgart by the end of the year.

Union pressure adds to existing concerns as to whether the
company will find enough technologies for the trials.

Deutsche Telekom has said it needs to become more efficient in
order to become internationally competitive, announcing plans to
double job cuts to 60,000 by the year 2000. After a meeting
between union officials and the phone company's management board,
Kurt van Haaren, chairman of the German Postal Workers Union
(DPG), said he was dismayed at the job cuts.

Deutsche Telekom's objective is to test different technologies
for delivering interactive on-line services at each site.
Participants and analysts believe open-ended licensing will build
an unpredictable market but that this unpredictability is
necessary for innovation in the industry.

Invitations are still open to participate in the trials but some
industry observres are dubious whether enough choices exist.

Michael Gell, of British Telecommunications Plcs, said companies
would have to guess their way through the coming years of
regulations.

            ACORN LOSSES FORCE CALL FOR GBP17M CASH

Acorn Computer Group Plc of Cambridge, England accompanied year-
end figures showing a loss of GBP34m with a GBP17m cash call to
fund its Online Media division.

Online Media requires further significant investment as the
directors do not envisage large scale exploitation of the
interactive multimedia market until 1997 at the earliest. Online
Media is the preferred supplier of Northern Telecom Ltd for
television set-top boxes for trials in the UK and the rest of
Europe.

It warned that there were considerable risks attached to Acorn's
entry into the interactive television market.

Acorn's principal shareholder, Ing C Olivetti & Co SpA will not
be taking up its entitlement in the issue. Its shares will be
placed with institutional shareholders, reducing Olivetti's stake
to 58.9% from 78.5%. The balance of the proceeds will be used to
support the core business, Acorn Computers Ltd, after a diffcult
year.

               PERSONAL COMMUNICATORS TO SUPPLY
               WIRELESS VIDEO IN FIVE YEARS' TIME

Wireless personal communications will include video multimedia
within five years, according to industry executives who expect
wireless ATM by 2000.

Reuters reports that telecommunications officials expect business
users and consumers to turn to wireless personal communicators to
use interactive services across the world within five years.

Speaking at a telecommunications conference in February, Leif
Kallan, chairman of Sweden's Telefon AB, said, "voice telephony
is not enough. The ultimate standard should be radio ATM. We
believe this can be brought to market by the year 2000."

ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is a high bandwidth networking
protocol that is vaunted by interactive multimedia companies as a
prerequisite technology for sending high volumes of data along
network wires. It is used by telephone carriers and large
companies who need capacities up to 65 times those of
conventional networks such as ethernet, and has not yet reached
the desktop.

Mobile phones and pagers are the most common wireless devices and
Reuters reports that industry consultants, Frost and Sullivan
Inc, project the worldwide market for personal communication
services and handsets worldwide will grow from $88m in 1993 to
over $8,000m by 2000, rising to $19,000m by 2002.

"Wireless is the fastest-growing segment of the
telecommunications industry, which is the fastest-growing
industry in the world," said David Rogers, president of Rogers
Cantel Mobile Communications Ltd. He thinks there is strong
growth potential in developing countries which are expected to
feature strongly in the cellular boom.

Michael Patriarche, vice president of market development at
Northern Telecom Ltd, told Reuters that the cellular phone market
was growing by about 20% a year in developed countries and 80% a
year in emerging markets.

But many executives consider newer markets such as personal
wireless communicators as having even more exciting growth. Les
Shroyer, general manager of Motorola Inc wireless data systems
division, has predicted that 16% of the laptop computers sold in
North America will have wireless modems by 1998, compared with
2.5% today.

For multimedia to become a reality on the personal wireless
communicator, the communicators will have to be capable of
transmitting and receiving faxes, information services and email.
Shroyer said communicators are expected to have speech and
handwriting recognition by the end of this year.

He added that wireless multimedia, including moving images, will
begin in 1997 predicting that sound, text and motion will be
available at the turn of the century.

           PACIFIC BELL CONDEMNS FCC PRICE INCREASES
                      FOR CALIFORNIAN ISDN

Pacific Bell has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) to withdraw plans to raise ISDN line charges in California,
which the regional Bell believes will push prices up by as much
as 50%.

ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) employs a single line
with multiple channels to provide high-speed digital transmission
of voice, data and video services. The technology provides much
faster access to information services and is claimed to be
essential for the successful take-up of video telephony.

Subscriber charges for ISDN are currently based on the number of
lines. The FCC wants to introduce a new charging structure that
will charge for the number of channels within the line. Basic
Rate ISDN can have up to three channels per line, while Primary
Rate ISDN lines can have up to 24 channels.

Under the new rate schedule for Basic Rate SDS, Home and Centrex
ISDN services, Pacific Bell customers will be charged for one,
two or three lines, depending on the configuration. Primary Rate
ISDN customers will be charged for either 23 or 24 lines.

Pacific Bell said the new charging structure will raise Basic
Rate Home and Centrex ISDN prices by up to 29%, SDS ISDN prices
by up to 43% and Primary Rate customers by up to 50%.

Pacific Bell issued a formal request to the FCC to waive Section
69.104 of the ruling, allowing the company to retain its current
method of charging by line rather than channel.

"ISDN has become a very cost-effective way to enter the
Information Superhighway," said John Gueldner, Pacific Bell's
vice president of regulatory affairs.

"But now, the mandated increase in ISDN line charges is a major
roadblock. Pacific Bell has made a concerted effort to keep its
prices for ISDN lines affordable."

He criticised the FCC for wanting to introduce a damaging mandate
"at the very time that ISDN is growing rapidly among small to
medium-sized businesses".

"These price increases will severely curtail this growth," he
said, adding that they could even reverse this enthusiasm to the
point of impeding future research into the technology.

Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of the Pacific Telesis Group, provides
ISDN services to areas in California.

           AUSTRALIA PUTS GBP5BN INTO VOICE-TO-VIDEO

Australia Telecom is planning a GBP4,600m venture to upgrade its
cable network to include a new voice-to-video broadband network.

The planned infrastructure will improve the service of cable
television and introduce new features such as broadband telephony
and video conferencing.

Time scales were not available from the telecommunications
company but the plans would mean bringing forward the upgrade of
Australia's cable system, which is the basis of a pay-per-view
venture between Australia Telecom and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.

Telecom's cable network is currently under construction and is
intended to connect 4m homes at a cost of GBP1.64m over the next
four years. Current plans run the cable alongside copper wire
telephony.

Australia Telecom's chief executive, Frank Blount, confirmed to
the Australian Financial Review that the national carrier is
reviewing the economics of maintaining and upgrading a phone
network based on a copper wire technology that is rapidly
becoming obsolete.

Although Blount would not be drawn on the costs of an integrated
network, the Federal Government appointed Broadband Services
Experts Group has said that a network of this kind would cost "in
excess of (GBP4,600m)".

Blount said that he intended to keep telephony separate from
Telecom's pay-per-view venture with Murdoch, but National
Australia Bank's magazine, Decisions, quotes Blount as saying,
"if we can make a case that we're going to integrate telephony
and broadband at the same time, we may be able to see our way to
justifying that kind of expenditure and wire up the whole
country".

Faced with the distances involved in the project, Blount
acknowledged that satisfying demand in a sparsely populated
country would be difficult but the company planned to use central
points in towns, such as libraries, as the broadband access
points from which homes could then be connected.

The move being explored by Telecom would complement strategies
mapped out for the development of a broadband services industry
to be unveiled by the Government through the release of the final
BSEG report, said the Australian Financial Review.

Australia Telecom's rival, Optus Vision, is using digital
technology to deliver pay-per-view and telephony on an
infrastructure that could be expanded to video telephony. Optus'
system drops optical fibre and coaxial cable to homes mostly hung
from overhead power cables.

Australia Telecom and News Corp are fine-tuning their pay-per-
view venture with a strong alliance with satellite licensee,
Australis Media Ltd. Telecom-News and Australis are considering a
cross-equity arrangement under which there will be an allotment
of shares and options. These will allow the groups to consider
possible strategic alliances in the future.

simultaneously down a telephone line will drive new applications
such as personal conferencing.

The RC288ACi/SVD, which will ship next month for $100, was
announced by the Digital Communications Division of Rockwell
International Corp, which also sees the modem chip being used for
multi-player computer games and technical support.

It enables PC users to exchange speech and data simultaneously
down a single telephone line, supports the V.34 standard for
28.8Kbps transmission, and conforms to the Digital Simultaneous
Voice and Data specification agreed between Rockwell, Intel Corp,
US Robotics Inc and Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc.

It is combined with its own DigiTalk speech compression
technology that allows conversations at the same time as data
transmission at speeds up to 19.2Kbps. It also detects periods of
silence, when it boosts the data rate back up to 28.8Kbps
Rockwell International Corp's Rockwell Telecommunications has
opened a new wafer fab in Newport Beach, California and bills it
a key step towards its goal of becoming a $2,000m company by2000.
It aims to double its annual sales of data and facsimile modems
to about $1,000m by 1999, it said, adding wireless and multimedia
communications products to reach its 2000 target. The upgrade of
the plant to 8" wafers cost it $170m.

                HISTORY OF MULTIMEDIA - PART 2
            THE RULE OF CD-ROM AND VIDEOCONFERENCING

Multimedia technology main successes are in two areas: CD-ROM
and videoconferencing.

The most successful - and the first to be proven - is CD-ROM
(Compact Disc Read Only Memory) technology both as a means to
read large amounts of software and for companies to store large
amounts of data. Volume of information is the key. Each disk can
hold the equivalent of 300,000 pages of text - each disk holds
640Mb of information. The CD-ROM drive and a sound card provide
the baseline Multimedia PC (MPC) configuration.

                             CD-ROM

The number of drives shipped in 1993 soared by 170 per cent on
the previous year to 7.2 million worldwide. Research by Infotech
suggests that by 1999, 8 out of every 10 computers will have a
CD-ROM drive attached. The reason for the take-up is three fold:
they are cheap, they work and, with the increasing bulk of
Windows software, they fulfil a very useful function.

As with all emerging technologies, pricing is the key. CD-ROM
drives are available to computer dealers for under $100. They are
also being heavily pushed by software giants such as Microsoft,
which has used the increased user base of the drives deliver a
range of innovative software that takes advantage of CD ROM's
massive storage capability by allowing the user to run video
clips or search huge databases.

The Yellow Book standard for CD-ROM was set in 1986 by Philips
Electronics NV and Sony Corp. This set of guidelines for how data
was compressed and laid down onto the tracks of the disk.

Further standards allowed for compressed audio to be interwoven
with data - CD-ROM XA. The emerging Orange Book standard, which
is still under development, covers CD-R (recordable CD-ROM). At
present CD-ROM disks can only be record in one pass, unlike
magneto-optical (MO) disks and is a drawback of CD-ROM - that,
although it is very cheap for software houses to publish software
onto it - it is more expensive than conventional MO disks for
ordinary users to save data to.

The other CD-ROM standards relate to the drives themselves. The
original MPC (Multimedia PC) standard stated that the drive must
have a 'sustained data transfer rate' of at least 150Kb per
second, while using no more than 40 per cent of the CPU.

This standard was soon superseded, as a data transfer of 150Kbps
proved too slow to accurately produce seamless video on screen. A
second generation of 'dual speed' CD-ROM drives, which read the
disks at speeds of 300Kbps and above, have been developed by
manufacturers including NEC Corp, Pioneer Corp and Toshiba Corp.
The new MPC2 standard reflects the requirement for digital video
stored on disk.

                       VIDEO CONFERENCING

The second successful usage of multimedia technology is full
motion video images run on a PC. This technology - primarily
driven by advances in compression algorithms - means that faster
and better quality video can be played on the PC.

The obvious and concrete benefits for business are apparent:
Computer Based Training (CBT), presentations, point of sale
displays and - potentially the one with the widest impact - video
conferencing.

Video Conferencing is an area of concerted development for large
companies such as Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, mainly because
the technology developed for businesses will also crossover to
the perceived lucrative area of domestic video-on-demand
services.

Both Intel and high end workstation provider Silicon Graphics Inc
have developed video conferencing systems for the PC - although
both have been held back by the limitations of the personal
computer which when it was originally designed, or as it evolved,
was not expected to survive in so many manifestations.

As a consequence, video data can be sent at speed along ISDN
lines (although even these are slow offering 64 or 128Kbps
compared with fibre optic cables which can run parallel channels
each containing many megabits per second) but is brought
shuddering to a halt when it gets to the PC.

"The biggest bottleneck on sending and receiving video is the
system bus" said Silicon Graphics Steve Webb."

"Development there has not kept pace with processor development."
Launched in mid-1993, the Silicon Graphics Indy Workstation was
the first PC system built for dedicated peer-to-peer video
conferencing. It came with a 30 frames per second video camera
bolted to the top of the monitor and an ISDN port.

On the Intel platform, the struggle has been to improve the
compression of the mass of video data coming into the PC. Intel
itself released its Smart Video Recorder and Indeo compression
card in April 1993, but admitted that peer-to-peer video
conferencing required compression beyond what was available at
the time.

Intel limited its efforts to allowing PC users to view video
clips and this is where video on the desktop has stalled for a
while.

Many of the technical problems with the PC's capacity to handle
video have since been improved but there is one major obstacle to
overcome.

The lack of a nation-wide fibre optic cabling structure means
that video conferencing will - initially, at least  - be limited
to within a specific site, rather than over wider sites where it
is really most useful.

                          POINT OF SALE

Point of Sales Kiosks are a spin-off from PC video conferencing,
but a spin-off with, real spin. Point of Sales (POS) kiosks are
designed to run full motion video product demonstrations for
customers. The more sophisticated can also provide a 'real time'
video link to remote sales staff.

The Thomas Cook multimedia travel kiosk - at the firm's flagship
Marble Arch branch - is a good example of POS multimedia in
action.

Using a system developed and installed by Olivetti, prospective
tourists are wafted to their dream destinations without even
having to leave the travel agents. The system, which ended its
trials in prototype in mid-1994, uses 17" touchscreen to allow
customers to access video and audio presentations of popular
holiday destinations.

The POS system is more than just a fancy travel brochure. It has
an integrated video link so the customer could call up a
salesperson in the top corner of the screen. The system even
accepts electronic payment by credit card.

"Pushy sales staff scare off more customers than technology,"
says the Inteco Inc research firm, adding that certain types of
retail operations - where the products being sold are technical
or sophisticated - are better suited to selling by kiosk than
others.

The Thomas Cook system was based around a 486 PC with video
camera and board, ISDN connector, CD-ROM drive and, most
importantly, a touchscreen. Previous research has shown that the
keyboard is the major cause of fear and loathing amongst the non-
computer-literate.

The real interest with multimedia kiosks though, is as a
precursor for the world of home shopping.

This is where much of the development is, with the idea that the
user can summon up product information and make purchases from
their own home. The first moves in the UK have been through Intel
and Microsoft signing up with US cable companies to provide a
limited form of 'video-on-demand.' Multimedia kiosks are seen as
a link to the lucrative world of home interactive shopping.

                               CBT

Computer Based Training (CBT) and Presentations were the first
real uses of multimedia, and are still the biggest employers of
interactive technology.

CBT is primarily a way for the largest companies to standardise
the training that they give employees - by making sure that
everyone gets exactly the same message at the same time.
Multimedia sales presentations have traditionally been the
preserve of the largest corporates, which usually focus more on
an identical message tailored by bespoke software providers, than
on any egalitarian cutting edge technology.

The growth in CBT and presentations has come as they have been
opened up to smaller companies and developers, fuelled by the
launch of multimedia authoring tools.

The market leader for Windows authoring packages is Multimedia
Toolbook 3.0 from Asymetrix, which allows full-motion video
editing and the incorporation of video on the desktop. The
programme can then be imported into a more conventional
presentation package. As the use of multimedia extends to the
less bold, authoring tools will be used by wider  audiences
developing a broader range of interactive applications.

            3DO DENIES IT NEEDS EXTERNAL FINANCING

3DO has denied reports that it is looking for increased financing
despite stockbrokers recommendations that the company look
outside for cash before the end of the year.

Reports from Reuters in January had suggested the Interactive
Multiplayer device maker's chairman, Trip Hawkins, was making
calls for external financing for the 3DO graphics accelerator,
the M-2.

But a spokesperson for the company countered the report, saying
that the company would call on its existing associates, including
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd and Goldstar Co Ltd, before
casting a net out for new investors.

"If we do need financing we would prefer to go to our partners
first", the company said, adding that Hawkins had only suggested
that the M-2, codenamed 'Bulldog', as "an attractive strategic
business partnership for outside businesses".

But David Tabizel, a multimedia analyst at Durlacher stockbrokers
in London, thinks the company will need more money in the next
six to nine months and should not accept it from its existing
partners.

"They're grown up now and should see if they can fight it out on
their own," he said. "They ought to be looking at the US
investment community based on the M-2."

Tabizel also voiced concern about Matsushita's involvement with
other manufacturers such as Panasonic Co and Japanese Victor Co.
"They're hedging their bets," he said.

Trip Hawkins said that the M-2 accelerator was scheduled to be
shipping later this year. He also claimed that the accelerator,
and other manufacturing cost savings that he would not specify,
could take $100 off the $400 3DO price tag.

The timing of M-2's release is vital against other platforms due
for release, he said.

"M-2 is going to transform 3DO into one of the most feasible
platforms," he said, although he added that it depends on the
successful release of other 64-bit machines such as Sony's
Playstation and Nintendo's Ultra."Atari's Jaguar, he said, is
"nearly dead in the water".

3DO shares took a hit in May last year, falling 20% when Hawkins
was reported to be putting $10m of his own money into the company
to support it over 1995.

However, the company said Hawkins had always put his own money
into the company. "It's never been a problem for us to raise
capital," the company said.

        KODAK SNAPS MOVING PICS WITH HIGHEST RESOLUTION

Eastman Kodak Co claims to have produced the world's highest
resolution SLR 36-bit digital camera that can be taken into the
field, the DCS 460, available immediately for GBP25,000.

The DCS 460 is a single shot camera that can take a colour image
with a single exposure rather than the multiple exposure needed
for most digital cameras limiting them to still life photographs.

The news follows an announcement in January that Canon, Nikon,
Hasselblad, Mamiya and Sinar are to use Kodak's digital imaging
technology from the DCS 400 series for their digital cameras.

The CCD imager that sits behind a standard 35mm camera enables a
total resolution of 6m pixels compared with other cameras that
offer 4m pixels. The imager sits in a special electronic back
fixed to the body of a Nikon N90 camera.

The DCS 460 is a 'multi-megapixel' camera that does not require
multiple exposures to render a single colour image, a
characteristic that limits other cameras to still life
photographed in a studio. Kodak claims the single exposure camera
increase portability to the field or the studio.

Time taken between power-on and the first shot is 0.25 seconds
with about 12 seconds between shots while the camera saves the
image to disk. The DCS 460 can store images on removable PCMCIA-
ATA cards and includes a battery pack that is claimed to provide
power for over 300 images in a single charge.

Sound annotation can be included in the image for tagging or
identifying the image with a built-in microphone.

The imager for the DCS 460 is available separately as the DCS 465
Digital Camera Back. The digital imager fits to the body of 4" by
5" SLR devices. Pricing was not available.In February, Sony Corp
challenged Kodak's Photo CD by joining Japanese camera company,
Konica Corp, to develop a digital imaging system that records
film on Sony's 2.5" Mini Discs.

Sony's system enables users to record images from photographic
negative films, slides, prints and printed materials directly
onto the optical disks, and edit the recorded images and
manipulate them into various formats. The system comprises an
image recorder, an image processor and a scanner. Up to 200
images can be written on one disk, and it takes seven seconds to
record one negative. Prices and marketing for Sony's system have
not yet been set.

It said that it is in talks with potential buyers but no sale has
been made.

The company's acting president Vern Raburn said that although the
company had doubled its revenue over the last year it had become
clear that if it were to achieve its long-term business and
financial goals, it had to focus its resources in those areas
that would provide the most opportunity for growth.

It sees these as visual and multimedia authoring software with
appropriate add-on tools; graphics tool for creating three
dimensional images and animation; and a video editing tool.
The core product in the client-server tools business is Asymetrix
InfoModeler version 1.5, a visual modelling tool for database
design.

The entertainment division's products include screen savers based
on Jurassic Park, the Pink Panther, Rocky and Bullwinkle among
others.

Asymetrix says it is also attempting to sell Compel, the
company's multimedia presentation graphics product.

                     THE GREAT EXHIBITION

The US, UK, Japan, France, Germany, Canada and Italy - the Group
of Seven - met in the weekend of February 25/26 to discuss the
impact of the information superhighway on jobs, culture and
economics.



"The distances which separated the different nations and parts of
the globe are rapidly vanishing before the achievements of modern
invention, and we can traverse them with incredible ease ...
thought is communicated with the rapidity, and even by the power,
of lightning."

So said England's Prince Albert in a speech given to Royal
Commissioners of the Exhibition in preparation for the Great
Exhibition of May 1, 1851. The Exhibition was the world's chance
to show off the latest and greatest technology and gave the
analysts of the age an opportunity to discuss what could be done
to make it better.

Almost 150 years later, G-7 ministers in Belgium over the weekend
of February 25/26 were surrounded by a trade fair of scientific
sorcery from more than 100 of the world's leading technology
firms.

The amazement was apparent as delegates watched demonstrations
including machines to check hand prints instead of passports,
two-way educational link ups for schoolchildren in isolated areas
and virtual reality guided tours of world museums.

Winding up the conclusion of the Conference, the Chair said, "Les
temps est venu." The time has come... again.

But the G-7 conference differs from its Victorian equivalent is
that the participants do not believe we are creating a perfect
world.

Jaques Delors, chairman of the Information Society Round Table
said, "I am not saying that a globalised world will be better
than a non-globalised one. Maybe we lived better in the 15th
Century... one must face reality."

This reality has added two uncomfortable lessons to the
unswerving passion that enthused the Victorians to consider
theirs the"period of most wonderful transition" that held the
world for a little under a century.

The fact that some countries have lagged the technological leaps
of the US, Europe and Japan has not been lost on the G-7's
ministers. To avoid a two-tier system, ministers are talking of
bringing developing countries up to speed by allowing them to
"leap-frog" the technological evolution over which they have
presided. Open access to networks and the equality of opportunity
are central principles of the G-7 framework.

But jumping evolutionary stages and avoiding the instability that
can occur in economies swamped by technological revolution is no
easy process.

In cases such as Singapore, which is small enough to share the
benefits equally among its population, little administration is
needed.

In others, with urban and rural areas so far apart that whole
cultures differ within the country, the two can work in conflict.

As one economist pointed out, the conference would not attempt to
solve the world's problems, but the adverse affects of hasty
evolution is evident in the trade wars between US and China.

China, like Japan, has been leap-frogging technology for years
and the US, having most to gain from deregulated competition due
to a massive and highly sophisticated telecommunications
infrastructure, is aware of the threat to fair competition that
is inherent in an unbalanced global system.

China suffers - or will suffer - from a culture that has not
grown up with copyright law and expects the black market to act
as a valid sector of the economy. That same culture will find it
difficult to marry urban and rural areas when faced with the
scale of telecommunications multimedia.

Technology can be treated as an exogenous variable in economics,
driving or being driven by a country's internal money system.
Small countries such as Singapore can benefit easily if the gains
due to technology can be distributed quickly and fairly around a
small population.

But a country the size of China, or the former Soviet Union,
requires a stronger hold on the infrastructure and education
Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's vice president, sees investment in
domestic labour as the greatest benefit G-7's ministers can offer
his country.

He sees his society becoming a mere consumer of information
unless foreign companies move manufacture to the newly
democratised country. "Come and make your computers in Ghana," he
said. "Come and make them in South Africa."

If the US gets its way and Al Gore, chieftain of its information
revolution, opens its telecommunications market to foreign
investment "up to 100%", there seems a much reduced role for the
authorities.

Computer standards - like governmental regulation, customarily
subject to the chore of an administration - have been in the
hands of the industry for years. But there is a central
distinction between the computer industry, with its competitive,
consumer-driven motivation, and the telecommunications industry
which has been the ward of government since it replaced the
railways.

It is a familiar saying by now that free trade tends to be
advocated by those people who have most to be gained from it.

Two weeks after the Great Exhibition of the 19th Century, the
editor of Illustrated London News pointed to the hoards of
working men and women who swarmed around the exhibits, "the men
who made the Exhibition what it is, and who, we fervently hope,
will derive the greatest advantage from it."

                      OUTSOURCING THE NET

CERN has passed responsibility for the Internet to MIT and the
French research institute, INRIA. Marsha W Johnston talks to the
Internet's adopted parents.



In the coming months, network security and commercialisation
issues, such as how to create paying services, will be the
highest priority subjects for Internet development, says Olivier
Muron, director of promotions and technology transfer for
France's National Institute of Research in Informatics
and Automation (INRIA).

Up until a few weeks ago, INRIA was just another Internet service
location and Muron's sentiment would have been just another Web
user's speculation. But following an agreement with the European
Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, INRIA, along with
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is now
responsible for supporting and managing the evolution of World
Wide Web (W3) technology.

CERN has been the centre of W3 technology since Tim Berners-Lee,
a CERN researcher, invented it in 1989. That the invention came
from the elite international community of high-energy physics was
not surprising, since it "is a very geographically distributed
and computer-literate community that has been using computer
networks to distribute documents and for email for a long time,"
says Mike Sendall, secretary for CERN's Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) experiments committee.

W3 was a welcome development because it alleviated the
physicists' headache of using multiple, incompatible networks
around the world to exchange the voluminous test data that is
critical to better understanding the behaviour of the universe.

Having invented W3 technology, CERN naturally developed as the
centre of the standardisation effort for 'The Net' (aka
Internet). "In the early days of The Net, it was entirely
appropriate for us to be the focus of activity," Sendall says.

Today, however, there is an entirely different story. No longer
is the Internet the privileged domain of a largely academic
computer user audience. The Internet Society reported that new
Net subscribers grew 22% in the fourth quarter of 1994, while the
(.)net domain, used largely by commercial service providers, grew
at an astonishing 66%. At this rate, the society predicts the Net
will count 100 million hosts by 1998.

"The centre of gravity has shifted, if you like; the Net is now
of much broader interest than just to our community," Sendall
said, by way of explaining why CERN chose to disengage itself
from W3  development and promotion.

"It was a question of the amount of work there is to do and to
what extent it maps onto CERN's mission," said Sendall. He added
that the approval in December of the Collider project made it
increasingly difficult for CERN to continue its historic W3 role.

At the time, Sendall was already in discussions with MIT and the
European Commission on establishing joint European/US support for
the W3 standards. "Both the EC and CERN wanted a strong European
presence with the standard and INRIA seemed like a good bunch of
people to take it over," he said.

Indeed, INRIA has been the starting point for some of France's
hottest young information technology companies, including Object
Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMS) developer O2
Technology, C++ tools editor ILOG and SGML expert Grif. Aside
from running its own professional Web service.

INRIA developed a Web service '100 Years of Light in the
Paintings of French Museums' for the Ministry of Culture and was
retained by the EC as a 'national host' for advanced Web services
in its Advanced Communications Technologies & Services.

"INRIA has done quite a lot of Web development. They have not
played a big role in central standardisation issues, but they are
quite experienced in networking and security issues," Sendall
said, adding that those are the two most important areas for The
Net at this stage.

No decisions have yet been made on how to split development
duties, he said. Service support will be "divided up more or less
geographically to minimise our telecom charges, but it will be
transparent to the user," he said.

Broadly stated, however, INRIA and MIT's work will comprise four
main areas:
- evolution of Web components, including the markup language,
html, the client/server dial-up protocol, http, and url, the
universal residence locator;
- development of a reference code;
- supply of general information about the Web; and
- promotion of the technology and its distribution.

Sendall said CERN will continue Web developments that are
targeted specifically at its own user community, rather than
generally focused issues.

Muron places great importance on the informational aspect of
INRIA's charter. "We have to provide enough detailed information
about the Web so that someone who doesn't know anything about it
could learn on their own how to use W3 technology," he said.

In the meantime, INRIA is planning an increase in its own Web
service. "To pass the level of directory service consultation as
CERN's, which is automatically accessed by thousands of users
every day, we need bigger workstations and increased network
capacity," he said.

Sendall is not worried that CERN's departure will cause standards
to evolve away from the users. "We use lots of other standards
that we don't define."

                   REAL ACTORS TAKE A BREAK

Virtual actors are to be used in a commercial for Rowntree
Macintosh to be screened in May.

Rowntree, a subsidiary of Swiss food giant, Nestle SA, has
contracted Snapper Productions, a London-based production
company, to make the commercial using a virtual simulation
technique known as Motion Analysis.

Details of the production are a closely guarded secret but Robert
Goldbold, the producer of the commercial, said the techniques
used were "like nothing before".

Motion Analysis begins with a digital coding technique called
Cyberscanning which captures colour and texture data such as that
on a person's face. The data is then "wrapped around a geometric
wire-frame" and animated.

Cinesight Ltd, a digital production house working on Lawnmower
Man 2 in London and Los Angeles, said it was not aware of any
other commercial using this technique.

The lack of virtual reality technology in commercials was
emphasised by Pat Joseph, production director for The Mill, which
recently made an advert for the Nationwide building society , the
second biggest in the UK. The Mill's advert merged an image of
Alfred Hitchcock with a lookalike reading the script.

"There's very little VR in television commercials at the moment,"
he said, stressing that although using technology to sell was
impressive, "the most effective commercials are still the comic
ones".

Walt Disney Co has registered a patent that manipulates video
textures such as the face of a recording of a live actor.

            VIRTUAL SCHOOLING TRAVELS TO 14 STATES

The US West Foundation will be taking virtual reality across 14
states to schools which are unable to motivate children to
learning.

The Foundation is the philanthropic arm of telecommunications
company, US West Inc, which spent $1.2m of its annual $25m budget
on the project.

Two Virtual Reality Roving Vehicles (VRRVs) were proposed by the
Foundation in collaboration with the University of Washington's
Human Interface Technology Laboratory (HIT Lab) and UK virtual
reality systems firm, Division Ltd. The vehicles are actually
just vans carrying the virtual development equipment to schools
across US West's 14 state territory.

Virtual reality environments are ideal for stimulating children
who are not attending classes to take a more active role in the
lessons, according to Jane Prancan, executive director of the
Foundation.

Children and teachers are taught to use a menu-driven version of
Division's authoring software, dVise, to build virtual
environments in which they can move around rainforests or see the
movements of molecules."

It does require kids who put the virtual environment together to
do a lot of their own research," she said.

Clive Jones, a marketing manager for Division, said the menu-
driven system was far easier to use than language-based
programming environments.

Bringing up a menu, the children can choose shapes and colours,
positions and constraints, then scale or colour the virtual
world, he said. The developing environment enabled children to
create worlds with icons on screen or author on the fly in free-
space.

"The object of the programme is to bring in interest from
students who are switched off from schooling," he said, "using it
as a stimulus to bring them back into the learning process."

The Foundation first took the VRRVs to Garfield High School, a
school in a low-income, high-minority area of Seattle,
Washington. The vehicles will cover the rest of Washington before
moving on to Nebraska. The VRRV is also intended to be taken into
rural areas where technology is not given the funding afforded
metropolitan schools.

Division donated one third of the cost of the two GBP65,000
ProVision 100 systems and head mounted displays and the company
is keen to increase its presence in educational products like the
VRRV. It is currently involved in the 'Train to Travel' project
in Miami which uses virtual reality to teach mentally
disadvantaged children to use the local bus service.

The Foundation, which has donated more than $50m over the past
two years, also funded a $550,000 project in Denver, Colorado, to
create the on-line Families and Children Network launched in
February in partnership with advice agencies, in particular the
national non-profit network, HandsNet, and the Centre for Human
Investment Policy (CHIP) at the University of Colorado, Denver.

The Network links families to consultants in professional advice
agencies.

           RENDERMORPHICS 3D APIs DUE FOR WINDOWS96

Microsoft has acquired RenderMorphics to include 3D application
interfaces in versions of Windows after Windows95.

London-based RenderMorphics Ltd has been converting its Reality
Lab 3D rendering library to run on a variety of operating systems
including Windows NT 3.5 for iAPX-86, WinG, Alpha, PowerPC and
the next release of the Sony Playstation.

All employees will be brought into the Microsoft fold. Reality
Lab development will remain in the UK but the marketing personnel
will be relocated to the US. Terms of the deal were not disclosed
but Microsoft shares rose 50c to $62 following the news.

Anne Mitchard, senior Windows product manager in the UK, has been
given responsibility for Microsoft's development of the Reality
Lab 3D library. She said the technology would be used to develop
3D application programming interfaces (APIs) to be included in
future versions of Windows although it will not be available in
Windows 95.

She confirmed that the technology would increasingly become a
feature of future operating systems although she would not say
whether this meant an immersive environment for Windows.

"You're going to see a lot more 3D influence in operating system
environments," she said.

Nor would Mitchard comment on what the successor to Windows95
would be called although Brad Silverberg, vice president of
Microsoft's personal systems division, told PC Week in February
that the incremental upgrade would be called Windows96.

RenderMorphics sales would not be affected by the acquisition and
products, she said. Reality Lab 3D version 1.1, due by the end of
April, would still be available to outside developers. Version
2.0 is currently in beta.

Microsoft has been demonstrating a number of products at the
Multimedia Reviewers' Workshop in February, including the
Enhanced CD standard due to replace Multisession CD, and
Mediamatics Inc's software MPEG player that is planned for
Windows 95.

AOL.COM

A small advertisement in the local newspaper has had a group of
campaigners for better behaviour all over the place, Dutch and
Gloria Pruyne, picketing Fry's Electronics in Fountain Valley,
California, part of a seven store chain for two consecutive
weekends.

The ad read "Meet Dominique St Croix, Penthouse magazines'
Hottest pet! She'll Autograph Your Copy of the New Penthouse
Photo Shoot CD-ROM Volumes I, II and II, Saturday 2pm, Fry's
Electronics, Fountain Valley, California".

The Pruyne fliers read "Studies show that urban areas with
sexually-oriented businesses have higher crime rates than similar
areas without such businesses".

I spoke to Mrs Pruyne who advised me that she would not want her
daughter going out with a boy who had just pored over nude
bodies.

She doesn't actually have a daughter but two sons, one David, 27,
who lives at home with his parents and does have a CD player for
his PC. He claims never to have seen an 'adult' CD-ROM but says
he "gets the basic concept".

Gloria Pruyne complained that men had been coming out of the
store "waving the CDs in our faces".

"When men are into pornography, they desensitise themselves to
normal sexual stimulation," she said lowering, her voice to warn
me, "then they lead their wives into kinky sex".

A spokesperson for Fry's - usually impossibly difficult to
extract a comment from, in Palo Alto who would only identify
herself as "Janet" pointed out Dominique St Croix would have her
clothes on at the store when she arrived. When we checked at the
store, we found that Penthouse CD-ROMs have sold out with another
order placed and on the way.

                  CROSS DRESSING NEVER EASIER

The virtual mirror, which enables people to try clothes on using
the computer, has been developed by Spanish firms, Arcast SA and
Cyan Animatica SA.

Arcast's Luis Claudio Arfuch described the system as a "kind of
automatic cash-dispenser, with a built-in camera that captures a
high-definition image of the potential customer".

A height and weight sensor helps to adjust the parameters of a
standard model to each person. The biggest technical challenge is
creating certain effects, such as tucking a shirt into trousers.
Once items have been chosen, the machine prints out a ticket
showing  size and price.

The machine will operate interactively 24 hours a day, so it can
be consulted even when the shop is closed.

                   AMERICA ONLINE PRESSURES
              MICROSOFT NETWORK WITH 2M SUBSCRIBERS

America Online has added over 500,000 subscribers giving it a
total of 2m users of a service which analysts reckon is cheap and
intuitive enough to threaten the Microsoft Network due later this
year.

Figures from America Online, the largest on-line service in the
US, show that it has more than trebled its subscriber base in
just over a year. The on-line service provider had 600,000
subscribers in January 1994.

Lorraine Sileo, an on-line analyst for Simba Information Inc,
admitted she found it hard to believe America Online's success
was sustainable but the company's low and predictable connection
costs would put it at the head of its competitors for some time.

Although America Online claims to have spread "through word of
mouth", she said it had gained a considerable number of
subscriptions from the access software being included in bundles
with PCs. America Online spokesperson, Pam McGraw, refused to
comment on how many subscriptions arose from PC bundles.

Sileo said affordable charges with no surprise bills was the most
important factor to families. "You know what your bills are going
to be," she said.

While this applies to present competition such as Compuserve Inc
and Prodigy Services Co, Sileo also drew attention to the
Microsoft Network as a potential victim to home consumers'
prerequisites, citing too few free areas and the possibility of
an unreliable launch.

"Microsoft probably won't launch until the end of the year
considering its anti-trust problems," she said, "and when it does
I don't think it will have the content. There will probably be
more premium services (than America Online). Right now America
Online doesn't have to worry about the Microsoft Network."

Refusing to comment on America Online's competition, McGraw said
the success was due to the mix of features and affordable price
of the on-line service.

          LONG-DISTANCE PROVIDERS GET "WAKE-UP CALL"
                    FROM NETPHONE ON INTERNET

The pending Internet telephone service is a "wake-up call" to
purveyors of long-distance telecommunications, said Andrew Green,
founder and president of Electric Magic Company in San Francisco.

The three-year-old company is currently sampling a demo version
of its voice Internet software product, NetPhone, over the World
Wide Web.

Because of the proprietary nature of the few Internet Phone
methodologies now hitting the market, long distance carriers are
not under a threat - for the moment, Green said.

"I see Internet telephone service as an inspiration and a wake-up
call to the telephone industry," he said. "This is something that
can't come from the top down. It has to come up from the bottom
roots of the industry.

"I don't see Internet telephones replacing normal phones, but
acting as an adjunct to them."

Right now, interoperability and the fact that relatively few
people are hard-wired into the Internet, are the biggest factors
holding back the technology.

But all it takes is time, he said, adding, "give it a couple
years. It's just a matter of cranking out the software".

Internet telephones will provide much more flexibility because of
the lack of regulatory controls and standards existing on today's
long-distance carriers.

"You can't even do something as simple as split the cost of a
phone call," Green pointed out.

Internet phones are a good use of the bandwidth using only about
one-sixth of the carrier. Internet packet-switched signals travel
at about 10,000bps as opposed to the 64,000bps required for
normal connection-switched voice calls.

NetPhone software, which Green developed with his partner, Denise
Meyers, runs only on Macintosh LC II computers or better with
800Kb of memory available.

System requirements also include a microphone and a serial-line
Internet protocol (SLID) or a point-to-point protocol (PTP)
Internet connection.

NetPhone uses Electric Magic Company's own audio compression
algorithm which compresses the voice bandwidth to 10,000bps over
the Internet.

The software is available for demo review over Info-Mac and its
UK mirror site. NetPhone is available for purchase at $55 for one
copy and $85 for two.

VocalTec Inc, based in Tel Aviv, IsrAel, and NorthVale, New
Jersey, announced the Internet Phone last month. the software
allows a TCP/IPconnection to carry an international telephone
call via the Internet at the cost of a connection to a local
Internet provider at local prices.

VocalTec is offering the software at $50 with plans to double the
price when the company's trial period finishes in April. An
evaluation copy is available from VocalTec's Internet Web site
which had 25,000 accesses in the first three days of opening.

Virgin Group hopes "to do a Swatch" on its multimedia PC this

Virgin Group hopes "to do a Swatch" on its multimedia PC this
Summer by making the "uglier bits more visible". Peter Welsh,
managing director of Virgin Group Plc's PC division, Virgin
Euromagnetics, said the new moulding design will do to the PC
what Swatch did to the watch. Transparent panels will overlay red
and black mouldings to make the internals of the PC visible and a
big, red knob on the front. Virgin began production of PCs in
1993 with targeted sales of 25,000 a year but failed to secure
sufficiently firm retail channels for the PCs. The company hopes
its OEM agreement with ICL last September will put it on sturdier
ground.

Apple Computer Inc has lost its suit against Microsoft Corp and
Hewlett-Packard Co over the look and feel of the Macintosh user
interface, Windows and Hewlett's NewWave. The US Supreme Court
has allowed the ruling that dismissed the copyright lawsuit and
denied Apple's appeal. The appeals court ruled that most of the
screen display was covered by a 1985 licensing agreement that
allowed Microsoft to continue marketing a similar product. The
court held that the rest of the display consisted mainly of
symbols that were not protected by copyright law because they
portray generic ideas or functional items.

An industry group called the ASDM Forum has been created to
promote Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line technology for
interactive multimedia services over copper telephone lines. The
group has three main aims: to encourage the development of
interoperable end-to-end asymmetrical subscriber line-based
systems; to define which  services are suited to the technology;
and  to encourage the use of ASDM. ASDM Forum said  that research
by British Telecommunications Plc showed that ASDM is suitable
for a variety of services in that, for example, the technology is
operable at greater distancces - upt to three and three quarter
miles at 2Mbps, and that Moving Pictures Expert Group coding
works well. BT also reckons  it is viable for use over 92% of its
network. The group will meet in London this month and is planning
alternate venues in Europe and the US. Its board comprises
representatives from Bell Atlantic Corp, British Telecom,
Ameritech Corp, US West Inc, Amati, Westell Inc, Orckit Ktd,
Gorham and Partners, Motorola Inc, AT&T Corp's Largo and
Paradyne, Independent Editions and Amalog Devices Inc.

Full and immediate competition in the communications industry

Full and immediate competition in the communications industry
would create 48,100 new jobs in Massachusetts by the year 2000,
according to a study released by internation economic forecasting
firm, The WEFA Group. The study concludes that immediate
competition would result in the creation of 3.4 million new jobs
in all states and all major industry groups by the year 2005.
Legislation currently being debated in the US would repeal
federal restrictions prohibiting competition in local and long
distance telephone, cable television and manufacturing. The WEFA
Group Study found that full and immediate competition would lower
telecommunications and cable rents by nearly $55 billion per
year. In fact, cost savings associated with competition would add
$850 to the annual disposable income of every US household.

email is what counts. "The chairman has this wonderful room. He's

show - it's not for work, "he told MF. "Intel has 35k employees.
We believe email is our mission critical approach. If payroll
breaks you'll pay people tomorrow. They're going to complain but
the enterprise will not stop. If e mail stops, the company is
brought to a grinding halt. We exchange several hundred thousand
messages per day inside the corporation. It allows a much more
flexible structure. Hierachy becomes considerably less important.

Singapore Buys Into U.S. Video Server Technology

The Republic of Singapore with 3.2 million population and a land area
smaller than New York City has emerged over the past decade as one of
the economic tigers of Asia. Already a powerhouse in electronics
manufacturing, Singapore seems destined to emerge as an important stop
on the information superhighway.

According to the World Competitiveness Report, which ranks the
economic strength of countries across eight categories, Singapore
ranked first in telecommunications infrastructure, largely because all
of Singapore's telephones are digital, and all of its telephone
exchanges are linked through optical fiber. All Singapore homes are
expected to be connected to fiber-optic cable by the year 2005. In
addition, about 99 percent of the Singapore population owns color
televisions; 84 percent own video cassette recorders; and four percent
own video laser-disc players.

And Singapore has also just launched a video-on-demand trial using ATM
and a Hewlett-Packard video server that will bring it firmly into the
21st Century. Initially, the system will cater to 300 households, of
which 20 will be completed in third quarter 1995 (first phase) and the
remaining 280 homes in fourth quarter 1995 (second phase). The total
contract amount for the Project will amount to about $9 million.

The HP Connection

The Singapore video-on-demand trial, which is being built and operated
by Singapore Telecom, will be using the same Hewlett-Packard
MediaStream Server video servers that are being used by Pacific
Telesis, BellSouth and SNET in the U.S.

Unlike some other video dialtone solutions, HP's MediaStream Server
video server is designed explicitly for interactive video services.
HP's video server is based on a new hardware architecture called the
"video transfer engine," which HP says is built for moving vast
quantities of video data across networks in a way that lowers the cost
of delivering each video stream to users. HP's video transfer engine
technology is scalable and modular, allowing interactive-television
providers to add capabilities to each video server and to connect
servers in a network as consumer and business demand for
interactive-television services grows. For example, a single HP video
server can be scaled to deliver from 75 to 10,000 video streams, and
when multiple servers are connected, millions of households and
businesses could use the network to receive video-on-demand.

Joining HP to provide technology and services for Singapore Telecom's
video-on-demand trial are Mitsui & Co. Limited as the consortium
leader; Fujitsu Limited of Tokyo, which will be system integrator and
supplier of ATM switches and network technology; and Philips Singapore
Pte Limited of the Netherlands, which will supply settop boxes.

Sybase in Singapore

The other major vendor involved in the Singapore trial is Sybase, Inc.
of Emeryville, Calif. HP will integrate Sybase's software to run on
the MediaStream Server product. Sybase's Intermedia architecture
software includes three products:

- Intermedia Server for control and integration

- Gain Momentum for multimedia authoring

- Gain Interplay for settop box integration.

The deal marks the company's first overseas agreement for Intermedia
and follows on the heels of announcements that Sybase software has
been chosen by SNET and Cox Cable for their interactive television
trials. In Singapore, the Sybase software will be used to author,
deliver and manage ITV applications and integrate these applications
with Singapore Telecom's back-end subscriber and accounting systems.
In addition to working with Singapore Telecom on the ITV trial, Sybase
is also providing the company with relational database management
software to manage key business applications at Singapore Telecom,
including the company's cellular billing system.

The Intermedia products, in conjunction with video processor hardware
and settop boxes provide a complete environment for authoring,
delivering, and managing interactive multimedia applications and
services. The Intermedia Server is based on Sybase's SQL Server RDBMS
technology and provides two critical components: control and message
integration. The control component stores and manages information
about multimedia data objects (such as names and locations of movies
or product descriptions). The message routing component provides
routing of requests to and from the various components (settop box,
video server, and back-end business systems for billing and
subscriptions).

Gain Momentum is an object-oriented multimedia authoring environment
"for developing visual, intuitive, and entertaining applications." In
addition, Gain Momentum can access and manipulate data from Sybase and
other databases, allowing customers to integrate multimedia
applications with their existing and future business systems. Gain
Interplay is a software tool that allows interactive multimedia
applications to be played on low-cost, small-memory, hardware devices
such as the television settop boxes and home personal computers that
will be used to access a variety of multimedia offerings. The Gain
Interplay product will be available on a variety of settop boxes,
including Phillips' CD-I, Scientific-Atlanta's PowerTV,
Hewlett-Packard's Kayak, as well as on Windows-based personal
computers.

Content and Beyond

The Singapore video-on-demand trial is part of a broad government
initiative called "IT 2000." The goal of IT 2000 is to build a
state-of-the-art, broadband communications infrastructure and
supporting services to further strengthen the competitiveness of the
Singapore economy and to improve its residents' quality of life.
Singapore Telecom's multimedia trial will offer a broad range of
content, including customized interactive news, home shopping,
interactive learning for children and adults, documentaries, movies
and sports.

Because the population is predominately English-speaking, Singapore
Telecom expects early programming for its interactive-television
service will be primarily in English.

In the trial, Singapore Telecom will offer interactive services such
as movies-on-demand, interactive news and education, as well as home
shopping.

U S West Announces Omaha Multimedia Trial Deployment Plans Following
FCC Action On Channel Allocation

Following the December 23, 1995 Federal Communication Commission
action approving U S West Communications' channel allocation proposal,
the company has announced plans to move forward with its interactive
multimedia trial in Omaha, site of the largest interactive multimedia
trial in the United States. The company said it intends to move
forward as soon as an FCC order is released.

The next step, according to Larry Levine, vice president and general
manager of U S West, is to notify the video content providers (VCPs)
who requested to participate in the trial as to the number of analog
channels each will receive as a result of the FCC's decision. The VCPs
who requested analog channel capacity in Omaha are: Interface
Communications Group, Inc.; U S West Broadband and Multimedia
Services; Cablewest Communications Corp.; MetroVision, Inc.; Henry W.
Harris; Cable Video Store; and The Knowledge Network of Greater Omaha.
USA Video Corporation and Telephone Video of America have requested
capacity on the digital video network only. U S West Broadband and
Multimedia Services group has requested only one analog channel which
it intends to use as a promotional channel.

"We expect the video content providers will convene in January to
select the programming which will appear on the shared analog
channels," said Levine. He said U S WEST will provide a facilitator to
assist in these deliberations, but will not itself participate in any
decisions concerning selection, pricing, or presentation of video
programming.  Levine said he expects this allocation process to take
60-90 days.

Following that process, all of the video content providers (also known
as "level 2s") can proceed with activities necessary to launch their
consumer offerings. U S West Communications' "level 2" organization
expects to begin a "friendly user" trial to homes of about 50
employees starting in late first quarter. Following successful
completion of its friendly user trial, U S West will make its services
available to customers in a market trial area of more than 40,000
homes. This is expected to start during second quarter 1995.

In other FCC action, the Commission dismissed without prejudice four
video dialtone applications for Albuquerque, N.M.; Colorado Springs,
Colo.; Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "While we are disappointed
with this action, we believe the fact they were dismissed without
prejudice is a positive sign," said Levine. "We intend to make the
necessary revisions and re-file them as soon as possible." U S West
Communications announced in February 1993 that it would build an
interactive multimedia network serving customers in its 14-state
region. Two months later, the company revealed plans for the technical
and market trials in Omaha. The suppliers for the Omaha technical
trial are Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. (video transmission components and
digital settop terminals); 3DO (settop terminal technology); Digital
Equipment Corp. (video server); New Century Communications
(subscriber-management software) and AT&T (telephony components).

Sun and Thomson Alliance Launches Open TV Interactive Multimedia
Environment

Open TV, an operating environment for interactive television, has been
introduced by the alliance between Sun Microsystems Inc. and Thomson
Consumer Electronics SA. This is the first product from the alliance,
presenting a platform-independent solution for delivering interactive
services to consumers. Demonstrated at the Consumer Electronics Show
(CES) were samples of applications the alliance expects will be built
by developers using Open TV technology, including ticket channel,
interactive advertising and video-on-demand. The Open TV environment
allows cable, telco, satellite, and other broadcast network operators
and content providers to download interactive applications to settop
decoders through existing networks. The applications then use the
return path of the settop box to provide full interactive
transactional capabilities.

Open TV is platform-independent, designed to run on a wide range of
settop systems and it can be deployed on broadcast or ATM switched
networks. The commitment to open systems is driven by the philosophy
of both Sun and Thomson to develop interfaces based on industry
standards and protocols. At CES, the alliance team demonstrated a
number of sample applications running in the Open TV environment on a
live digital interactive decoder. In the demonstrations, viewers were
alerted to the presence of Open TV interactivity by an on-screen icon.
Through the remote control, the viewer could make selections that
include requesting information, ordering products, or additional
services. The sample applications shown included:

- A ticket channel application demonstration begins with MTV-style
programming and then overlays interactive graphics, allowing the
viewer to choose and order tickets to musical events.

- The interactive advertising demonstration shows traditional,
currently running ads and then invites the consumer to request further
information or browse through a product catalog and order specific
products.

- An video-on-demand application provides a scrollable list of
available films and concerts. The viewer makes a choice, and the
selection is immediately downloaded to the television through the
digital interactive decoder. This application offers full VCR control,
including fast forward, rewind and pause.

- The alliance will also support a set of authoring tool solutions for
Open TV applications focused on speeding the development, production
and deployment of new interactive programs.

Probita and General Instrument to Explore Level One Gateway Solutions

Probita Inc. and General Instrument Corporation have announced the
companies will work together to explore Level One Gateway solutions
for the management of connections in interactive video networks. The
Level One Gateway connects consumers with multiple information
providers by coordinating all elements of the Level One transport and
access networks. The two companies have agreed to leverage their
respective expertise in the development of the gateway for interactive
environments. The eventual system will, the companies said, manage
interaction among settop terminals, video servers, headends and
optical nodes on a real-time basis.

As multiple services come on-line, the Level One Gateway software will
control the switch fabric much like a telephony central office switch.
It will be a critical, 24-hour facility that must remain in continuous
operation while the network hardware, service definitions, and its own
software evolve through experience. Unlike central office switches,
however, the Level One Gateway will control a diverse distributed
switching system environment and support a variety of operator-defined
call models and applications.

"The architecture of the GI Level One Gateway will create an open
system usable in a multi-vendor environment," said Robert Lund,
director of network architectures and products for Probita. "It will
accommodate a wide range of subscribers on a variety of hardware
platform configurations. These two points appear to be of critical
importance to Level One operators."

CHIP BRINGS QUALITY VIDEO AUTHORING

Digital Equipment Corporation has announced a powerful, new
video coder/decoder (codec) chip that delivers high-quality,
30-frames-per-second (fps) video compression and decompression
for desktop PCs. The PCI-based 21230 codec chip puts
affordable video authoring and video conferencing on a wide
range of platforms based on Pentium, Alpha, and PowerPC
microprocessors.

Ed Caldwell, vice president, Digital Semiconductor, a Digital
Equipment Corporation business, said, "With the 21230 video
chip, PC vendors can deliver affordable capability on the
desktop for creating and using video-enhanced presentations,
interactive training, video conferencing, on-line monitoring,
and other forms of multimedia communication."

Video Compression Essential

Susan Yost, Digital Semiconductor's multimedia marketing
manager, called image compression/decompression "essential" to
reduce the heavy data storage and bandwidth demands of video
applications.

"Video authoring and video conferencing need a video codec
that not only compresses data efficiently, but delivers
high-quality video that accurately represents the original
material. And they need it in real time," she said.

"The 21230 chip is the first video codec to meet this
challenge at an affordable price," Yost continued. "The 21230
video chip implements state-of-the-art compression and
filtering techniques that provide efficient data compression,
exceptional image quality, and realtime performance. In
addition, as a PCI-based, single-chip implementation, it is
designed and priced for the PC market."

According to Peter Hess, manager of OEM development for FAST
Electronic US, Inc., a manufacturer of multimedia products,
"The 21230 chip is capable of encoding video and audio data
from tapes and laser disks into MPEG-1 format in real time for
storage and playback on digital compact disks."

Video Chip, CPU Work Together

Designed as a coprocessor, the 21230 chip takes advantage of
host CPU computing resources while concentrating on codec core
processes to achieve maximal functionality in a cost-effective
package.

The superior image quality of the 21230 video chip reflects
the product's sophisticated filtering, motion estimation, and
scene characterization capabilities, which enable optimal
video compression and decompression for excellent image
sharpness.

The chip interfaces directly to the PCI local bus and features
glueless interfaces to industry-standard NTSC and PAL
decoders, audio digital signal processors (DSPs), optional
peripherals, and external memory, greatly simplifying system
and board design processes.

Supports Video, Audio Standards

For video authoring, the 21230 chip supports MPEG-1
IB(B)P-frame and I-frame standards from constrained bit rates
(1.15 Mb/s) to higher bit rates. For video conferencing
applications, it implements the H.261 video compression
standard for H.320 video conferencing. In addition, the 21230
codec chip is architecturally compatible with the H.263
standard for H.324 POTS video conferencing. The chip also
offers resolution and format flexibility to satisfy customers'
specific needs.

Mikhael Haidar, general manager, Software and Systems
Technology Division at Analog Devices, Inc., said, "We have
worked cooperatively with Digital Semiconductor to provide our
industry- leading family of audio DSPs and codecs to complete
the audio subsystem of the 21230 solution," Haidar said. "This
combination furnishes outstanding multimedia capabilities for
desktop PCs at the lowest cost."

Pricing and Availability

Digital Semiconductor's 21230 video codec coprocessor chip is
priced at $75 in quantities of 10,000. Volume shipment is
scheduled for spring 1996.

The 21230 chip will be packaged with software drivers,
libraries and utilities for Windows 95 and Window NT to
expedite development on standard consumer platforms. An
evaluation board, documentation and supporting software also
will be available from Digital early in 1996 to help board and
system suppliers to design the 21230 chip into their products
quickly.

Digital Semiconductor, a Digital Equipment Corporation
business headquartered in Hudson, Massachusetts, designs,
manufactures and markets industry-leading semiconductor
products including Alpha microprocessors and PCI chips for
networking, bridging, and graphics/multimedia, as well as
low-power StrongARM microprocessors under license from

MARKETING FIREPOWER AND PARTNERSHIPS WILL DETERMINE WINNER IN BATTLE
FOR DVD SHARE

  Competition among DVD hardware manufacturers is shaping up as a
marketing war in which the company that can take advantage of brand
name recognition, software cross-promotions and economies of scale has
the best chance of reaping top revenues.
      Thomson Consumer Electronics has a considerable edge, based
on the company's product positioning revealed at the recent 1996
Winter Consumer Electronics Show.
      The company expects to deliver product in late summer, likely
before any other vendor.
  On the manufacturing side, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
Ltd. will make DVD players for Thomson throughout 1996.  In exchange,
Thomson plans to manufacture digital satellite systems Matsushita will
sell under the Panasonic brand.  In 1997, Thomson will manufacture DVD
players and Matsushita will produce DSS systems.        
      "We're putting the band back together," said Joseph Clayton,
Thomson executive vice president for marketing and sales, referring to
the OEM agreement the company struck with Matsushita in 1970 in the
VCR category.  
      Thomson today commands roughly a 20 percent share in VCRs and
is aiming even higher with DVD.
      "What other company has three brands as powerful as RCA,
ProScan and GE?" said Guy Johnson, Thomson vice president for video
and multimedia.  "Nobody even comes close." 
Clayton's company will combine the manufacturing capabilities of
Matsushita with Thomson's worldwide presence, under such brand names
as Telefunken in Germany, Thomson in France and Saba throughout
Europe, for the DVD launch.  Such a massive product rollout translates
into economies of scale, which will mean a price advantage at retail.
       At press time, only two companies had announced DVD hardware
pricing.  Thomson plans to sell its basic model for $499, and Toshiba
America Consumer Products Inc. will bring in its entry-level model at
$599.  
      To let consumers know DVD is a technology that will not
become outdated anytime soon, Thomson is relying on alliances and
cross-promotions with content providers, namely Warner Home Video. 
Warner will release software titles concurrently for DVD and VHS.  The
company also plans to deliver the movies and properties already out on
VHS in DVD format.
      But Warner is not relying solely on Thomson to grow the DVD
software market.  The firm plans to co-market with Toshiba as well. 
  "We will co-promote with several hardware companies," said Warren
Lieberfarb, Warner Home Video president.  Lieberfarb described his
modus operandi as "counterintuitive" but said Warner "holds several
hardware co-patents on DVD components with Toshiba." 
       Toshiba executives promise to deliver hardware to retail
prior to Labor Day.
  Sony Corp., which will sell DVD hardware initially this fall, is
ramping up DVD software efforts.  Columbia/Tri-Star Home Video will
release 150 movies for DVD and plans to have 50 DVD titles available
to coincide with the hardware's launch.  Certain retailers who carry
Sony hardware also will sell the software. 
      In the marketing arena, Thomson has a decided advantage over
Toshiba, a company that promises to be among the top three share-
holders of DVD.

INTEL RAMPS UP NEXT-GENERATION CHIPS TO GIVE PC MAKERS MORE OPTIONS

  By taking advantage of a .35 micron manufacturing technology,
Intel Corp. will be able to boost production on its 150- and 166-MHz
processors quickly, giving PC manufacturers an ample supply of the
next-generation processors they need to enhance their products.
  "This is by far the single biggest ramp we've had in the Pentium
history," said Joanne Hasegawa, a spokeswoman for the company.  "We
expect to see systems right off the bat." 
  Typically it takes Intel several months to produce enough new
processors to  fill demand, but PC manufacturers that spoke with
Multimedia Week Editor Judith Abrams said they expect an ample supply
of the new chips.
  NEC Technologies Inc. last week made its 150 MHz Pentium Ready
9552 available.  
  Other vendors Intel is supplying with its first 150 MHz and 166
MHz Pentium chips in quantities initially include Gateway 2000, IBM and
Hewlett-Packard Co..  IBM's 166 MHz unit is available.  (Intel, 408/765-
7525.)

ATARI CORP. WILL BEGIN SELLING PC GAMES UNDER ITS NEW ATARI INTERACTIVE
DIVISION

  Hoping to leverage its library of video games including Pac Man and
Asteroids, Atari Corp. will begin selling PC games under its new Atari
Interactive division.  Analysts believe the company could have a tough
time selling its PC titles to retailers.  Atari has a history of poor
relationships with retailers because of overpromising titles, such as
its E.T. game, that flopped.  Atari has not had much success with its
Jaguar video-game console, which has sold approximately 200,000 units
since 1993.

MANUFACTURERS DISAGREE ON HOW MUCH DVD HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS CAN SELL 

  How much DVD hardware will manufacturers be able to sell in the
product's first few years on the market?  Manufacturers disagree. 
Thomson Consumer Electronics projects sales in the United States to
reach 4 to 5 million units in the product's first three years on the
market.  Sony Electronics Inc. offers a more conservative estimate: 
Five-hundred thousand units in the first year and 2 million in three
years.  Toshiba America Consumer Products Inc. puts the figure at 1
million units in DVD's first 12 months on the market.

CHIP INTEGRATION, 3D AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY WILL STORM THE MARKET
IN 1996 

     Three-dimensional graphics, improved chip functionality and
enhanced communications are the top three developments expected to
penetrate the home market for multimedia in 1996.  But do not look for
any major changes on the multimedia landscape before the second half of
the year.
  Multimedia Week Editor Judith Abrams spoke with several key
manufacturers and industry analysts to find out what trends and
technologies vendors should prepare to capitalize on this year.  Here is
what they had to say:    

  ...When Will the 3-D Market Explode?

  The most visible enhancement expected in the software and chip
businesses will come in the form of 3-D games.
  "We see 3D permeating the graphics world, offering a slew of
features and performance that just aren't available today," said Ken
Wirt, vice president of marketing, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.  "By
the end of the year, you'll probably see a significant number of PC
systems come 3-D enabled."
  Wirt said at least 10 new 3-D companies entered the market last
year.
  What could slow the trend toward better graphics?  Insufficient
software.
  Experts involved with the technology disagree about when it will
hit the market in full force.
  "There'll be enough titles in the second half, say the September to
October time frame, that 3D is going to be a mainstream part of the
market," said Murali Dharan, vice president of marketing for consumer
PCs, NEC Technologies Inc.  "You'll see a few hit titles, and that's all
that'll be required.  People have bought Sony PlayStation and Sega based
on much less."
  Barry Lebu, president and CEO of Jazz Multimedia Inc., is even more
bullish on 3D.
  "It's really going to explode," he said.  "You'll probably see two
dozen titles out there in the next 90 days."    

  ...More Functions, Fewer Chips

  Look for more consolidation in the chip industry, with companies
attempting to buy each other and integrate several functions onto a
single chip.
  "People who have had strong markets in one area [audio, video or
communications], are going to try to expand," NEC's Dharan said.  "I
wouldn't be surprised if S3 went out and bought some other companies. 
You might also see an established company (be it a single chip firm or
company that manufactures multi-functional chips) go out and gobble up a
specialty chip company."
  The current trend is to combine 2-D, 3-D and digital video, but
more functions could be on the way.
  "There are some rumblings about communications," Wirt said. 
"There's a couple guys saying they are going to combine all this with
DSP."
  Such a move, however, requires keen timing and a heavy R&D
investment.
  "Video, audio and communications are three separate disciplines,
and you're competing against companies that all they do is one thing,"
Wirt said, adding that "development cycles aren't synched up exactly."   
  Whether these new chip designs make it to the motherboard is
another question.
  Intel Corp. is expected to deliver its MMX initiative, an
enhancement of its next-generation processor with multimedia extensions,
sometime in 1996.
  "I don't think it will be ready until the second half of 1996,"
said Richard Chang, an analyst with Bear Stearns & Co. 

  ...Cable Modems On Hold

  Cable modems are expected to impact the CD-ROM as a means of
delivering content, but they will not threaten the disc business in
1996.
  "The idea of delivering the kind of graphics we build into a game
through the Net and high-speed modems is at the moment a fairy tale,"
said Ben Tenn, vice president of marketing for Activision Inc.  "It can
take you two days to download the video we put on a couple of CDs."
  Others agree.
  Diamond's Wirt forecasts 1996 as a year in which transmission
companies will begin work on new services.  But delivering service is
another story.
  "Anything beyond analog modems requires either the cable companies
or the telephone guys to upgrade their systems in some way," he said. 
"I don't think anything like that is going to happen widespread in
1996."

  ...Improved Communications Means Content Enhancements

  Expect more advances on the Internet and in other kinds of modem
technology.  More PC manufacturers are expected to add digital
simultaneous voice and data modems (DSVD) to their products.
  Many vendors added high-end modems to their top PC models in 1995,
but the  technology is far from mainstream.
  "That's likely to happen in the second half [of 96]," said NEC's
Dharan.
  As a result, consumers will be able to do more things with their
PCs.  For example, they might use the technology to peruse information
about airline flights and make a reservation at the same time.
  Activision, and several other publishers, plan to leverage modem
technology to make better use of the Internet.  In the company's
upcoming title Spycraft, users will get information fed to them from the
company's Web site.
  "We'll be able to deliver extra levels, but the core game engine
and the graphics have got to be delivered on a CD-ROM," said Tenn.

  ...Budgets Grow, But Prices Continue to Fall

  Activision spends about $2.5 million to $3 million on development
per title, and company vice president Tenn sees that number rising.  
  "This business requires deeper marketing dollars and greater and
grander tools," he said.
  Despite budget increases, CD-ROM prices are coming down.
  "Everybody's very concerned about the lower-end price points," said
Robert Peterson, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc.  "The average price
will go down because of the growth in the budget category.  It's going
to continue to sell."
  Activision's Tenn is not too concerned that the low-end titles will
bring down the prices of big-budget titles.
  "What you'll see is the back catalog will be priced down at $19 and
$20," he said.  "The consumer will continue to pay top dollar for the
top games."

  ..And on the Desktop Front

  Multimedia PC manufacturers are expected to continue to drop
prices, but a high-end, niche category that emerged in late 1995 will
continue.
  "There is a market for higher-end, upscale game machines that were
popular during Christmas," said Bruce Stephen, an analyst with
International Data Corp.  "We will see more focus on the $1,500 price
points, but manufacturers will try to keep them up and refresh features.
  And what are those features?
  By third quarter, 6x and 8x speed CD-ROM drives will become
standard features on PCs, along with 28.8 Kbps modems and 16 MB of RAM.

PACKARD BELL'S FORAY INTO SOFTWARE IS TOO BIG A STRETCH, `DOOMED TO
FAILURE'  

     Packard Bell Electronics Inc. is attempting to extend its brand
name into the CD-ROM business, but industry watchers are skeptical about
how much clout the firm will carry with software buyers.
  The company launched its Active Imagination software brand last
February as a pilot program, but is ramping up a grander CD-ROM effort
with updated packaging, a new distributions strategy and a new name--
Packard Bell Interactive.  
  The division's leaders believe it can rely on the operations
strength of its parent company for administrative, shipping and other
functions involved with selling software.
  "That gives us the opportunity to start this company with far less
revenue than a new startup would need," said Glenn Uslan, vice president
of corporate marketing.
  Analysts are skeptical. 
  "I think if they're going to try for synergies it's doomed to
failure," said Lee Isgur, an analyst with Jeffries & Co. Inc.  "There is
no evidence that a hardware brand has any impact on the success of the
software brand."
  Key industry players agree with Isgur.
  "Rarely, if ever, has a hardware company truly understood
software," said Ben Tenn, vice president of sales for Activision Inc.
  An executive who got his start selling hardware for Panasonic, Tenn
pointed out that industry heavyweights Matsushita and Sony have not been
able to translate their hardware expertise into the content arena.  "And
that's on a grand scale with enormous talent and resources," Tenn said. 

  But Packard Bell executives believe they can make the transition.
  "Our software will be available to all Packard Bell retailers this
quarter," said Uslan. 
  For the past six months, the company has bundled a two-for-one
software coupon inside its hardware to encourage customers to buy Active
Imagination software at retail.
  "By bringing the customer back in to buy more, we have a direct
contact with 3 to 4 million customers a year," Uslan said.  
  On the content side, Packard Bell is outsourcing title development
and focusing on the children's education market.  Four new CD-ROMs are
expected at retail in the next few weeks.  
  Rose Studios Inc. of Redmond, Wash., developed Little Red Riding
Hood and Goldilocks and the Three Bears.  Australian-based Brilliant
Interactive Ideas Pty Ltd. developed Monster on the Loose and Dinosaur
in the Garden.
  Later this quarter, the company plans to bundle a copy of the
Yuckadoos, which hit retail last year under the Active Imagination
label, with every Packard Bell Interactive title.
  "We're hoping to sell 25,000 to 30,000 units in the first quarter
and give away that many," Uslan said.
  To aid the initiative, Packard Bell hired John Rutter, a former
marketing manager with Microsoft Corp., and Steve Boehm, who previously
held positions with Medio Multimedia and My Software Company.  (Packard
Bell Interactive, 818/735-7578; 206/654-4180.)

AMERICA ONLINE ACQUIRES IMAGINATION NETWORK; TWO DOZEN LAYOFFS
EXPECTED

     America Online Inc. [AMER] has acquired The ImagiNation Network
Inc. (INN), an online game provider, from AT&T [T].  The deal was
valued at more than $10 million, a source told MMWire.  As a
wholly-owned subsidary of AOL, INN will become a primary partner in
AOL's Games Channel, and is expected to strike deals with Internet
Service Providers as well as AOL's competitors, said Tom Monagan, AOL
spokesman.  INN's senior management team will remain intact, but the
company will lay off 24 employees, said INN spokeswoman Cindy Wilson. 
The game company has "critical experience" developing multiplayer
online games and the ability to "build community in the way we like,"
said Lawrence Schick, g.m. of games for AOL. INN will begin offering
games on AOL in the fall, and later this year will launch CyberPark, a
3-D environment in which gamers take on customized
characters--"avatars"--to play the games. (America Online, Ted
Leonsis, president, 703/448-8700)

$8.5+ MILLION CAMPAIGN FOR SEGA'S NiGHTS: CAN IT COMPETE WITH NINTENDO
64 DEBUT?

     In an apparent bid to upstage the much-anticipated debut next
month of the Nintendo 64 and its Super Mario 64 title, Sega of America
is launching an $8.5 million marketing campaign to promote its Sega
Saturn title, NiGHTS. ($49.99).  The title--which will debut on August
20--will come less than six weeks before Nintendo's debut on Sept. 30. 
"There's no question [Nintendo 64] will be a dominant voice in the
holiday period," Anne Moellering, Sega of America's marketing manager,
told MMWIRE.  "We're clearly aware of that," Moellering added.  About
80 percent of Sega's marketing budget will be devoted to TV
advertisements for NiGHTS on ABC, NBC, and other channels.  Moellering
added that it was a "coincidence" that Sega was debuting NiGHTS so
close to the Nintendo 64's debut.  Sales of the Nintendo 64 in Japan
have exceeded expectations thus far, and most analysts predict that
the 500,000 units Nintendo expects to ship in the United States this
year will sell out.  Nintendo reportedly is spending $50 million to
market the Nintendo 64 and its acclaimed Super Mario title.  Sega also
will sell a NiGHTS bundle pack ($69.99), which includes the title and
a 3D controller pad; and the 3D-controller pad ($39.99).  Sega's other
marketing efforts will include print advertisements, tie-ins with the
Six Flags resort, and in-store standup demonstration units.  (Sega of
America, Anne Moellering, marketing manager, 415/802-3280)

BIG TUNA NEW MEDIA LEVERAGES BOOK CHARACTERS VIA CD-ROMS

     Big Tuna New Media, a CD-ROM developer, is developing two CD-ROM
titles for GT Interactive [GTIS] this year and has three titles on the
block for next year, said John Sansevere, president of Big Tuna New

of Little Critter, a character popularized in Big Tuna's book Just
Grandma and Me, which has sold more than 80 million copies under the
Living Books imprint. The Rocksbury, Conn.-based company includes
background artists, animators, writers and storyboard artists.  This
year, Big Tuna is developing Just Me and My Mom and Little Monster
Private Eye.  It also has published more than 100 books and has

EUROPE ONLINE GOES BANKRUPT

     Europe Online (EO) was declared bankrupt by the Luxembourg
commercial court, and its assets will be liquidated this week. 
CompuServe Corp. [CSRV] was one of several suitors that had worked to
bail out Europe Online. The court had set an Aug. 2 deadline for
bringing together a deal with new shareholders, after its largest
stakeholder, German publisher Burda GmbH, jumped ship in July. Deutsch
Telekom AG was a late bidder to save the company, while ITT Corp.
[ITT] already had made it known that it was eyeing the service.  
     Though EO had garnered only 25,000 subscribers since its March
launch, analysts called that substantial growth in a market where
income and penetration of PCs lags well behind the United States.  Lou
Kerner of Merrill Lynch pointed out that CompuServe's bid may have
been a strategy to win "mindshare" in Europe with a more familiar
name. Analysts speculated that what really hurt Europe Online was the
dropping out of its largest (one-third) shareholder, Burda. "Clearly,
they're scrambling," Kerner said.  (Europe Online, Luxembourg,

MMWIRE EARNINGS ROUNDUP:

     CyberCash Inc. [CYCH], a provider of secure transactions over the
Internet, reported revenues from credit card transactions grew to a
meager $16,086 for the quarter ending June 30. 
     The lackluster numbers are "not what's driving investor
enthusiasm," said Robertson Stephens analyst John Powers, adding,
"they're really paying for 1997, 1998 and beyond." 
     An "incredibly strong endorsement," Powers said, was Sun
Microsystems' [SUNW] decision to include CyberCash technology in
future releases of Java.
     Although the company posted a net loss of $6.2 million, or 59
cents per share, it has a $51 million "war chest," Powers said,
predicting CyberCash could be profitable by early 1998. (CyberCash

     Source Media Inc. [SRCM], which plans to roll out its
television-based Interactive Channel on Labor Day, reported revenues
for the quarter ending June 30 dipped 4 percent--to $2.3 million--from
the same period last year.
     A $2.8 million net loss for the second quarter was less than the
$3.6 million the company posted in the same period last year. (Source

SOUNDCARRIER GROWTH SLOWS DRAMATICALLY IN MAJOR MARKETS

Music & Copyright estimates that the combined sound-carrier sales of
the four largest markets in the world grew by only 6% in 1995. These
territories together represent almost two thirds of the world's
soundcarrier market.

However, apart from the decline of the MC format in all territories and
the recovery of the sale of singles outside the US, no overall pattern
emerges for the US, Japan, Germany and the UK. Japan and the UK
experienced double digit growth over the year, but there was little
growth in either the US or Germany. The table below shows Music &
Copyright's estimated individual growth rates for the world's top four
soundcarrier markets plus a combined growth rate for all four
territories weighted to account for the relative size of each market.

In 1994 there was a 16.5% increase in value of the world soundcarrier
market, according to record industry trade association IFPI. In the 30
national markets which represented over 90% of global soundcarrier
sales this fell to 14% in the first half of 1995 (see M&C 76/3). The
major cause of this was a decline in the growth of CD unit sales which
slowed down from 25% in 1994 to 19% for the first six months of 1995.
This decline continued into the second half of 1995.

According to US trade paper Billboard, SoundScan, which collects sales
data from music retailers, reported that 409.5m CDs and 245.7m MCs were
sold in the US in 1995. This represented a rise of 11.2% in CD sales
from 1994 and a 16.2% drop in MC sales.

Bearing in mind the higher price of CDs, in value terms, these figures
mean that the US market has hardly had any growth. Although the unit
figures of SoundScan and the US trade association RIAA are very
different, because one tracks sales and the other trade shipments,
their percentage figures for growth and decline have generally been
close.

Certainly SoundScan's percentage changes are close to the trade
shipments reported by the RIAA for the first half of 1995, which were
plus 13% for CDs and minus 15% for MCs. These contrast dramatically
with 1994 when the RIAA reported a 34% growth in CD trade shipments and
a 2% growth in MC shipments.

Moreover, US soundcarrier sales over the Christmas period,
traditionally the biggest sales period of the year, were flat.
According to SoundScan, unit sales were down 0.03% in December 1995
compared to the same period in 1994 and the growth rate for CD sales at
12.4% was lower than for the year as a whole. The International Council
of Shopping Centers, which tracks sales at 400 regional malls in the
US, reported that music and related home entertainment sales were down
0.3% on Christmas 1994 in contrast to a 4.7% rise in mall sales
generally.

Accordingly, most observers are predicting minimal growth in the value
of the US soundcarrier market in 1995. Some even predict that total
soundcarrier revenues will hardly top 1994's $11.84bn. They give two
main reasons: poor sales by superstar albums and increased competition
from computer software.

Although Hootie and the Blowfish sold an unprecedented 11m units of
their debut album Cracked View Mirror in the US, as a whole there were
fewer big-selling albums there in 1995 than in 1994. Only 278 albums
sold over 500,000 units each, compared with 340 titles in 1994. Among
the top acts whose albums did not meet expectations were Elton John,
Rod Stewart, Paula Abdul, the Rolling Stones, Bonnie Raitt and Michael
Jackson, whose HIStory only sold 2m units in the US.

In addition, video and computer games now compete for the dollars that
were traditionally spent on music. In the first half of 1995 software
sales grew by 12% (compared with 8% for soundcarriers) and in the last
quarter of 1995 several computer chains reported an average 40%
increase in sales of personal computers, with 30 of the US' 64 major
computer retailers reporting better than expected sales. Only 11
reported sales below expectations.

Soundcarrier sales in Japan totalled $5.43bn in 1994. Whereas there was
20% growth in the US soundcarrier market in 1994, sales grew by only 1%
in Japan that year. But sales of music in Japan grew by at least 10% in
1995. Western compilations were increasingly successful in Japan in
1995 (see M&C 79/3). CD titles of international repertoire manufactured
inside the country in the first 11 months of the year represented 39%
of the market, or 95.2m units. Shipments of international repertoire
grew by 19%, compared to 8% growth for domestic repertoire. However,
figures compiled by the Japanese trade association RIAJ, which show an
11% growth rate by value in the year to November, may underestimate the
situation. They do not include albums imported by Western-owned
retailers (such as Tower) and Japanese record companies, which
increased greatly in 1995. In the first six months CD imports rose 24%
by value to $193.4m and 40% by units to 32.7m (see M&C 74/6). Sales of
singles in Japan have also continued to rise. In the first 11 months of
1995 sales grew 22% in units and 18% in value.

Earlier in the year, observers predicted that Germany, which posted 3%
growth in value in 1994 and 12% growth in the first six months of 1995
according to IFPI, would have a 6% plus growth rate for 1995. However,
in the light of a disappointing summer, poor Christmas sales and fewer
major releases than expected, most have revised this figure downward.
The most dramatic fall in growth was of CD shipments, which fell to 7%
for the first nine months of 1995 after being in double figures
throughout the 1990s. In view of this and the 15% fall in MC shipments,
Music & Copyright estimates that in value terms the German soundcarrier
market will grow at between 1% and 2%. Taking account of inflation,
this figure represents hardly any growth at all in real terms (see
story on page 8 for more detail on the German soundcarrier market).

Huge Christmas sales, the continued revival of the singles market and
the Britpop phenomenon, which had a noticeable effect on album sales in
the second half of the year, combined to create double digit growth for
the UK soundcarrier market in 1995. Most observers predict the UK
market will grow by more in 1995 than the 17.4% increase seen in 1994
and the 18% growth reported for the first six months of 1995.

UK sales in the fourth quarter alone were over 20% higher than in the
same period of 1994. Almost 50m albums were sold, with just under 15m
sold in the two week Christmas holiday period. Of these sales some 2m
(or 4%) were accounted for by Robson & Jerome's eponymous debut album.
This was in addition to the sales of 2.8m copies of the duo's first two
singles. The Britpop effect can be seen in the Top 100 selling singles
of the year. In 1994, 39 of these were by British acts; in 1995, 49,
the highest ever number in the 1990s since 1991.

SHORTAGE OF SUPERSTARS BRINGS DECLINE IN NORTH AMERICAN CONCERT GROSSES

The value of concert tickets sold in North America fell by almost 33%
in 1995 to $950m, according to trade paper Pollstar. Nonetheless,
ticket sales in 1995 were the third largest in the history of the US
and Canadian concert industry. The top 50 grossing tours accounted for
78% of the total with combined ticket sales of $742.7m.

The two significant trends of 1995 were the decline in the number of
superstars touring and the emergence of a number of new headline acts.
In 1994 the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd together took $225m, which
was just over 16% of the $1.4bn raised by ticket sales in that year. In
1994-1995 the Eagles, whose Hell Freezes Over was the most successful
reunion tour ever, grossed $142.7m in total, of which $63.3m was earned
in 1995, representing almost 7% of the year's ticket sales.

However, few other superstar acts toured apart from R.E.M., Boyz II
Men, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page and the Grateful Dead. The Dead
cancelled their autumn tour following the death of group leader Jerry
Garcia and have since said they will no longer perform live.

Among the new acts who toured successfully were Hootie and the
Blowfish, who translated the 11m sales of their debut album Cracked
View Mirror into $8.8m in concert ticket sales. Other new acts which
grossed high figures on tour included the Dave Matthews Band ($9m from
130 shows), Jodeci and Mary J. Blige ($7.7m from 30 shows) and Phish
($15.7m from 79 shows). In the country field, Mary Chapin Carpenter and
John Michael Montgomery had large-grossing tours for the first time.

Several acts earned more from touring than their record sales might
have suggested. Among these were Page/Plant ($33.4m), Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers ($27.5m) and Elton John ($22.5m). More in line with their
record sales were the touring revenues of two country acts, Reba
McIntire ($27.4m) and George Strait ($15.2m). Strait's 49-show tour
helped his MCA box-set sell far better than expected.

Another reason for the decline in 1995 concert revenues was that acts
tended to play smaller venues. Whereas in 1994 three football stadiums
shared first place for mounting the biggest shows, no football stadiums
were among the leading venues of 1995. Similarly, whereas 17 concerts
grossed over $5m in 1994, none did in 1995.

However, as the table below shows, if 1994's exceptional figures are
excluded, the 1995 figures show a modest return to growth. This
moderate increase in ticket receipts is expected to continue into 1996.
U2 looks set to be the biggest tour of 1996, (although the group has
not yet announced dates). The Rolling Stones and the Eagles are
expected to continue their ongoing tours, but not in North America.
Bruce Springsteen's solo acoustic tour will probably include as many
bars as concert halls and accordingly will not be among the year's
largest grossing tours.

EMI MUSIC WINS RIGHTS TO LIFE FOR MRSE

UK Mechanical Collection Society MCPS has accepted EMI Music's claim
that the 10 works on Simply Red's Life album were not registered with
MCPS. This acceptance was reached at an MCPS board meeting before
Christmas and frees EMI Music to collect the phono-mechanical rights
due from Life directly from Simply Red's record company Warner Music
Europe. EMI Music intends to do this through Mechanical Rights Society
Europe (MRSE), a collection society it specifically set up for this
purpose (see M&C 80/5).

EMI says it wants to do this because of excessive delays in receiving
monies through the GEMA-Warner Music Europe central licensing deal and
the high rebate GEMA gives Warner. Prior to this, GEMA argued that the
works had entered the European copyright system through MCPS and that
EMI Music could not withdraw them. GEMA has now written to EMI Music
saying it accepts that the phono-mechanical rights in the works are
registered with MRSE.

Music & Copyright understands that EMI still intends to divide the
mechanical rights in the works between MRSE (phono-mechanical rights)
and MCPS (non phono-mechanical mechanical rights) which it expects GEMA
to collect on its behalf (see M&C 78/5). In response to the argument
that this will inevitably drive up the costs of rights collection,
because the revenues (roughly 20% of mechanical revenues) are more
costly to collect than phono-mechanicals, EMI points out that higher
commission rates for the various mechanical rights are already in
place. GEMA's response to this is as yet unknown.

However, there is growing evidence that despite having set up MRSE,
which had its inaugural board meeting two weeks ago, EMI is more
concerned to get GEMA to reduce its rebate and speed up payment than to
make extensive use of MRSE.

Music & Copyright understands that these were the main topics discussed
at a meeting between EMI Music and GEMA, the first between the leading
executives of both organisations, at London's Heathrow airport last
week. Although EMI Music says it has other projects that it is
considering putting through MRSE, including at least one act that
records for EMI Records, it seems far more interested in resolving the
problem within the existing operating structure of the European
collecting societies. A further meeting between GEMA and EMI Music is
scheduled to take place at MIDEM on January 22.

ITALIAN ENTERTAINMENT SPENDING FALLS 4%

Spending on entertainment in Italy in the first six months of 1995 fell
4.3% in real terms to L2,164bn ($1.37bn), according to Italian authors'
rights society SIAE. Because SIAE collects entertainment taxes on
behalf of the Italian government it is well placed to see changes and
developments in the amount of money spent on entertainment in Italy.

According to SIAE, for the first half of 1995 attendances at pop music
concerts and popular arts events rose 16% to 2.9m, although the total
number of events was almost unchanged at 8,300. Receipts rose 16.6% to
$40m and average ticket prices rose by 0.6% to $13.75. Receipts from
classical music concerts over the six month period rose 9.3% to $22.2m,
mostly because of higher ticket prices which rose to an average $10.75
each. Unit ticket sales only rose by 0.7% to 2.1m for 9,000 concerts, a
similar number to the first half of 1993.

There were 1,000 fewer cinema screenings over the period: down from
285,000 to 284,000. Ticket sale receipts dropped by 2.9% to $240m and
the number of cinema-goers fell by 7.1% to 44.3m. Average cinema ticket
prices rose from $5.18 to $5.42. Theatre fared better than most forms
of entertainment. Box office receipts totalled $105m, a 10.5% increase.
Average ticket prices rose by 3.5% to $11.40.

Spending on sport dropped by 7% to $229.5m, SIAE said, although
receipts rose by 4.6% to $141m. Over the six months a total of 7.1m
tickets were sold for top class football matches, an increase of 1.1%
over January-June 1994.

U2-PRS CASE NEAR SETTLEMENT

Irish group U2 has won at least part of its battle with European
collection societies to reduce the deductions made from performance
royalties and the speed of payment. French authors' society SACEM has
reached an agreement in principle with the group and its publishers.
SACEM has agreed to reduce its administration costs and the cultural
deductions it makes and to pay performance revenues within 28 days.

U2 issued a writ against UK authors' society PRS in February 1994 after
a two year dispute with the society over the methods of collecting and
distributing public performance royalties for songs performed on large-
scale international tours (see M&C 35/2). Music & Copyright estimates
the gross performance royalties earned by U2 on its 1992-1993 European
tour at a little over $1m. U2 said it received less than 50% of this
and wanted to establish a system whereby the group itself collected the
money, which is calculated as a percentage of gate receipts. When PRS
refused to give the group back its performance rights U2 issued a writ
demanding their return. Nine European collecting societies were co-
joined to the writ in June 1994 (see M&C 44/1). This was because the
group needed the return of rights from each national society in order
to negotiate fees with individual promoters in Europe.

As a result of the agreement with SACEM, the French society will be
dropped from the writ. If, as is expected, it is followed by similar
agreements with other continental societies, they too will be dropped
from the writ. However, before these agreements can be made, U2 and PRS
must formalise their arrangements. The two have resumed talks after a
considerable time and an announcement of a resolution of the matter is
expected at the MIDEM trade fair later this month.

UK COPYRIGHT GOES TO 70 YEARS PMA

The harmonisation of copyright legislation within Europe came a step
closer January 1 with the adoption in the UK of a law meeting the
European Union (EU) directive of October 29 1993 on the issue. Member
states had officially been required to bring the directive into force
by July 1 1995. The most dramatic effect of the harmonisation in the UK
is to end the disparity whereby copyright ended 50 years after the
author's death, 20 years less than the EU term. The law applies to all
composers from European Economic Area states, Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Iceland, Ireland,
Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and
the UK.

Publishers contacted by Music & Copyright had not seen the bill, which
was only finally published last week, so several key points, which the
EU directive left up to individual member states to decide, were still
unknown. A key issue is whether or not the bill stipulates reciprocity
with other non EEA countries, which would especially affect US authors.
The UK authors' society PRS thought an immediate rise in licensing
income unlikely since it issues blanket licenses to venues and
broadcasters. However some classical venues may now have to apply for a
licence. This would create extra income.

Publishers say that renegotiation of fees will have to take place with
broadcasters since some, notably Classic FM radio, currently pay PRS a
low fee because much or most of their output is out of copyright. Among
composers coming back into copyright will be Elgar, Holst and Arthur
Sullivan.

Among issues PRS would like to see clarified are third party rights,
for example the rights of the arrangers of works now returning to
copyright protection. Also at issue is how revenues will now be
collected globally, particularly from US collection societies, since
most US protection is for less than 70 years. Mechanical rights society
MCPS has provided members with notes to ascertain whether works are
covered by the EEA term or whether they revert to country of origin.

Identifying the works that have gone out of copyright will create
initial costs. Moreover UK publishers feel that, at first, the new
legislation will lead to only a small increase in their revenues.
However, they expect to eventually see a considerable increase in
income, both from copyright material coming back into copyright and
from existing copyright material, which will earn money for longer.

France is now the only main European market which has not introduced a
new law to comply with the directive. French authors' society SACEM
says legislation was not presented to parliament in time for January 1
and is scheduled to be enacted in the spring. French law has afforded
authors of musical works 70 years protection and neighbouring rights'
holders 50 years protection since January 1 1986. For several months it
has been remitting funds to European collection societies in other EU
states on a national basis. SACEM says that this was done after the
October 1993 Phil Collins ruling.

CHINA CLOSES SIX PIRATE CD FACTORIES

International record industry body IFPI has won two important successes
in the fight against piracy in China. Five CD plants have been closed
in south China and the trading licence of a further plant has been
withdrawn by the authorities. In a separate action, IFPI and 23 members
were awarded $800,000 in damages by a court in Shanghai, China. The
court declared that in 1993 Taiwanese Shi Hua-Lek had illegally
produced over 95,000 copies of 31 albums containing 306 sound
recordings. Shi was also fined $43,000, ordered to pay costs and pay
for a public apology in China Daily.

The fine is huge by Chinese standards, but nonetheless IFPI was only
awarded damages. In Taiwan following a successful High Court appeal Shi
was sentenced to one year's imprisonment. No criminal case has yet to
be brought against a copyright infringer in China, which with sales of
256m pirate units is the largest pirate market in the world.

The Chinese authorities have been generally more willing to bring civil
cases to court than to try to stop pirate production at source. From
this perspective the steps taken by the authorities in Hainan and
Guangdon provinces late in December are highly significant. They
ordered the stoppage of production at four CD plants - the Zhuhai
Jiwellian CD Production Company, the Chazhou Xinle Laser Disc Company,
the Chailing Sound Production Company and the Hainan Anmei Laser
Production Company - which were manufacturing pirate CDs, CD-ROMs and
pornographic video-CDs. They also withdrew another plant's trading
licence after complaints by IFPI and seized moulds and pressing
equipment from a sixth plant, whose senior management was also
arrested.

All six plants are currently under investigation and IFPI is reasonably
confident that within a month further plants will be identified as the
source of pirate and pornographic CDs and CD-derivatives. Despite this
action, IFPI has made no moves to re-open its office in Canton which it
closed after death threats against its staff (see M&C 80/4).

In a further move, China's State Copyright Bureau and Press and
Publication Administration issued a circular on December 7 requiring
that two inspectors from the State Copyright office be based at all 270
registered manufacturing plants of audio and visual products from the
beginning of 1996. The inspectors will check that a Source
Identification Code is present on all CDs pressed and that Title
Verification has been established. They will be paid from local
government funds and will be barred from receiving gifts in money or in
kind from the factories at which they are based. The move was welcomed
by US officials at a meeting on December 20.

In addition, a new consumer law in China is having some effect against
piracy. Under the terms of the law customers can return fake and pirate
goods to stores where they were bought and get back double the money
they paid if the store cannot prove the items are genuine. In turn the
store can get double what it paid from its supplier, which in turn can
get double what it paid the manufacturer. US trade officials have
welcomed the law, although they point out that it is less useful in
dealing with copyright piracy than with piracy of high fashion items.

These moves come just before the anniversary of the Memorandum of
Understanding, signed last February between China and the US, which set
out a detailed timetable for China to introduce measures of
intellectual copyright protection. But, since signing the Memorandum,
China has made no significant progress in intellectual property
protection. New talks between the US and Chinese authorities are due
soon.

Commentary: PolyGram was the market leader in both album and singles
chart shares in Europe in 1995, according to European trade paper Music
& Media. The table above shows that PolyGram had a 20.7% share of Music
& Media's European Top 100 album charts and a 25% share of its
Eurochart Hot 100 singles chart.

PolyGram's success came despite the fact that its most successful album
label, Mercury, was only the fourth most successful with a 4.9% chart
share. The most successful labels were Columbia (8.1%), EMI (5.15%) and
Virgin (4.9%). Similarly PolyGram's most successful single label, A&M,
was only the ninth most successful label with a 2.5% share. The leading
singles labels were Virgin (5%), RCA (3.8%) and Iceberg (3.5%).

PolyGram's most successful album acts were The Cranberries, whose
Island album No Need To Argue accounted for 4.2% of the company's chart
share, and Bon Jovi whose Mercury album Cross Road was the third best
selling album in Europe. The greatest successes of second place Sony
were Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, French singing
Francis Cabrel and Michael Jackson. Because the figures are only
calculated from the first 48 weeks of the year, third-placed EMI's
share does not include most of the chart points due from The Beatles
Anthology and Queen's Made In Heaven. If they were included EMI would
probably be in second place. The company's most successful acts were
Pink Floyd and Simple Minds.

Sony had the most successful single of the year, Michael Jackson's You
Are Not Alone, but was only the fourth-placed company. Second to
PolyGram was EMI with hits from Shaggy, Meat Loaf, The Connells and
Edwyn Collins. Almost a third of the chart points of third-placed BMG
came from the two hit singles of Scatman John and Take That's Back For
Good.

In 1994 a number of mainland European acts such as Eros Ramazzotti,
Snap and Patrick Bruel had European-wide hits. In 1995 there were fewer
such acts. Only Danish-based Scatman John and the Dutch-based Rednex
had any significant European success.

Commentary: Shipments of all soundcarrier formats in Canada apart from

hardly any better than the situation in October 1995 when shipments of
all formats were lower than in October 1994. Despite these poor
results, the year-to-date shows the value of the market was 11% above
that in the comparable period in 1994. However the unit growth is far
lower at 4%. For additional comment see story on page 1.

SLOWER GROWTH IN 1995 FOR THE GERMAN SOUNDCARRIER MARKET

An unusually hot summer, a dearth of major releases and a disappointing
Christmas depressed soundcarrier sales in Germany in 1995. Early
industry estimates of a 6% growth rate have been revised downwards to
nearer 2% growth in value terms, but taking account of inflation, this
represents a stalling of the soundcarrier market in real terms. Total
record sales in 1994 were valued at DM5.68bn ($3.95bn). Of this 83%
came from BPW affiliated companies, 8.5% from non-members, 6.5% from
direct imports, and 2% from pirate product.

Figures from BPW, the German record industry's trade association,
showed a continued decline in cassette and vinyl sales and a 7%
increase in CD sales for the first nine months of 1995 compared with
the same period in 1994. However, the increase in the number of CDs
sold is unlikely to translate into the same growth in value because
many of the year's best selling albums were special offer compilations.

Unit sales of MCs and vinyl LPs fell by 15.4% and 40% respectively in
the first three quarters of 1995, continuing the trend of the last
three years. Growth in the singles market also slowed. Although sales
of CD singles continued to grow, up 9.3% to 30.6m units in the first
nine months of the year, (compensating for the 41.7% decline in vinyl
single sales to 700,000 units over the same period), January-September
unit sales growth in singles was of 7.2%, compared with 15% in the same
period in 1994. Overall, soundcarrier unit growth to end September was
3.2%. There was mounting industry concern that the CD singles market
was growing at the expense of CD albums, since many CD singles contain
as many as six tracks. A maxi-single typically retails at just under $9
compared with a long play format CD at around $21 or more.

The Virgin-McDonald's CDs

Soundcarrier sales in July and August were down 17% from the same
months in 1994, blamed largely on the long hot spell, which affected
most of Europe. Full 1995 sales figures have not yet been compiled by
BPW, but after the summer lull sales fluctuated considerably. September
was a good month, largely because of sales of the Virgin-produced Rock
Superstars Vol. 1 compilation. This was marketed through McDonald's
outlets at just $6.92 and sold 2.7m units in Germany, Austria and
Switzerland. Sales in October were up 10% compared with the same month
of 1994, but then rose only 3% in November, despite key releases such
as the Beatles Anthology and new product from Queen and the Kelly
Family.

December saw the release of Rock Superstars Vol. 2, again marketed
through McDonald's, this time with a $3.5m advertising campaign. The 14-
track album sold virtually the same number of units as Vol. 1 at the
same price. Market research showed one in six buyers of the first
compilation had never bought a soundcarrier before and that of those
first-time buyers, half made a second CD purchase before the end of the
year. World of Music, Germany's largest music retailer, reported a
lacklustre Christmas; December sales, which normally account for 18% of
annual turnover, were only 16% and only four albums were big sellers:
Queen's Made in Heaven, Michael Jackson's HIStory, Beatles Anthology
and Pur's Abenteuerland. Sales of this last were 50% below Queen's.

If, as expected, the final figures show that album market unit sales
rose by 3% in unit terms to about 211m units in 1995, the two Virgin
compilations will represent almost 2.4% of album sales overall and
almost 3% of all CD sales in the year, although less in value terms
because of their low price. Other budget CDs also contributed to unit
sales increases, according to IFPI members' reports of sales to clubs
and dealers. Budget CD sales rose 22.3% in the first nine months of the
year, while full price CDs rose only 5.7%. Unusually, sales of mid-
price CDs, which had a boom year in 1994, were down by 3.2%. Industry
observers blame discounting on full price CDs by retailers for this.

There was big growth in sales of German-language repertoire in 1995.
The country's November album chart showed an unprecedented seven albums
by German artists in the Top 10, and sales of domestic repertoire sales
rose an estimated 11% to account for 40% of the market, a record high.
Domestic repertoire achieved a 24% share of the year's Top 100 album
charts, and a record 41.3% in the singles chart. Albums by German
artists such as Pur, Die Doofen, Die Prinzen, Die Fantastichen, Die
Artzte and Westernhagen all performed well.

The continued growth of German repertoire

Consumers and radio stations are abandoning their bias towards Anglo-
American repertoire, say industry observers. This and the continued
strength of the dance and Techno genres has also helped boost domestic
repertoire's share of the market - reflected most strongly in the
singles chart. The independents' share of the singles chart rose from
16.8% in 1994 to 18.3% in 1995. The most successful independent was
dance label ZYX with a 10.2% share. Other successful independents were
edel (5.1%) EAMS (1.5%) and Semaphore (1%). The independents' share of
the album charts also rose, from 8.9% in 1994 to 10.5%. Independents
who had over a 1% chart share were edel (3%), ZYX (2%), Semaphore
(1.2%), SPV (1%) and Rough Trade (1%).

The VIVA music TV channel, which plays 40% German repertoire,
contributed to the increase in singles sales by German artists. In
April 1995 the company launched a second channel aimed at older
viewers, but playing a similar percentage of German repertoire. The two
channels have a combined reach of 21m people in Germany via cable and
satellite and another 3.5m in Switzerland and Austria, as well as
viewers elsewhere in Europe under the Eutelsat footprint (see M&C
75/12). As a result of VIVA's success, MTV has increased the amount of
German repertoire it broadcasts. In addition a new channel, COM-TV, is
due to start soon. It says it will cater for the 30-55 age group,
broadcasting German Schlager, folk, jazz and soul music. The channel
could further exposure given to domestic repertoire.

Sales of classical repertoire fell steeply by 10% in the first nine
months of the year, with no indications of an improved performance in
the last quarter. As a result, classical repertoire's 1995 market share
is predicted to be well below 1994's 9.6% by value and 10.5% by unit
sales. Catalogue sales have fallen significantly as the classical
market is now. like the pop and rock markets, primarily artist-driven.
At the same time the process of vinyl replacement has virtually ended,
local industry specialists say. In addition, low price and budget
material now represents a larger section of the classical market.

Compilations were another key feature of the German album market in
1995, representing 22.7% of the album charts Top 100 over the year.
Sales of compilation albums were up 8.3% in the first 10 months of
1995, with 27.5m units shipped. But local industry executives are
starting to question the value of the costly television campaigns
employed to market these compilation albums.

The majors in Germany

The major labels all have offices in Germany, except for MCA which is
still distributed by BMG. A company breakdown by album chart share (see
page 8) shows EMI as market leader, in 1995, despite dropping 2.3% from
1994. EMI had a strong showing late in the year with two albums by the
Kelly Family, two by Herbert Groenemeyer, as well as product by The
Beatles, Queen, the Rolling Stones, Roxette and Meat Loaf in the album
charts Top 20.

PolyGram closed in on EMI in second place, raising its album market
share 2.1% points to 20%. BMG was stable at 16.6%, followed by an
improved Warner at 16.1% and Sony showing a 2.2% drop to an album
market share of just 13.7%.

German retailing

Retailing continues to be dominated by department and chain stores,
where 40% of all soundcarriers are sold. Media Market and ProMarkt are
the biggest chains and the most aggressive price discounters, a trend
which continued to increase in 1995. A discounted/loss leader album can
retail for as little as $5.56 compared with the standard retail price
of $24.34. But there have been talks between the record industry and
the chains and some observers believe that aggressive discounting may
soon be a thing of the past. The success of these chains has led to a
sharp reduction in the number of independent music retailers over the
past decade.

Wholesalers, including rack jobbers, are responsible for 38% of all
soundcarriers sold, direct mail 17% and other outlets 5%. Industry
observers say there are too many wholesalers operating in Germany, and
that many of these are not really wholesalers but exist only to service
their own outlets.

Among speciality music retailers, the 19-strong German-owned WOM chain
is still leader. The Saturn chain is its main competitor. WOM had an
estimated 1995 turnover of $130m (87% of that from CD sales, see table
opposite), a rise of 3.8% on 1994.

Otherwise successful non-German competitors have failed in Germany.
These include French retailer FNAC and Virgin, which closed its last
German store in August. Foreign retailers blame strict laws on opening
hours, high costs and problems with suppliers for their lack of success
in Germany.

Nevertheless, HMV still plans to open a 1,500 square meter store near
Dusseldorf in September 1996. German retail outlets may open only
between 9 am and 6:30 pm on weekdays (until 8:30 pm on Thursdays) and
must close at 2 pm on Saturdays, except the first Saturday of the month
when they can stay open until 6 pm. No Sunday opening is permitted. A
change in the law on Sunday opening is not foreseen, but the record
industry is optimistic a proposed relaxation of opening hours, due to
be approved later this year, will benefit soundcarrier sales.

CD player ownership has continued to rise. The number of households
with one CD player or more (saturation rate) rose to 59% in 1995 with a
penetration level (number of players per hundred households) of 78%.
Video recorder saturation is 66%. It is estimated that only one
household in 250 has either a MiniDisc or DCC player. However, an
estimated 50% of the German population never buys a record of any type.

The video market

The video rental and sell through market is still growing in Germany,
with sell-through revenues outpacing rental for the first time in 1993
and reaching $661m in 1994. Sell through revenues are expected to have
reached $696m in 1995, with the rental market growing 6% after a fall
in 1994. According to European Video Review, there are 6,400 outlets in
all for purchase or rental of video tapes in Germany, 3,000 of them
supplied by rack-jobber MedienPlus. As with audio retailing, the
sector's growth is hampered by Germany's strict opening hours and the
lack of speciality multiples.

A new higher tax on receipts from touring could be backdated six years
and managers of top international acts have already protested against
the move and threatened not to tour in Germany as a result. One British
concert promoter estimated his backdated tax bill could reach $1.6m.
High grossing acts such as U2 and Dire Straits would be among the most
seriously affected by the new tax. UK managers, accountants and
promoters met in December and formed a six-strong steering committee to
lobby for the decision to be reversed. They hope to meet with Germany's
finance minister to discuss the issue.

Following the incorporation of the European Union's cable and satellite
directives into German copyright law, which was effective from, January
1 1996, the country now enjoys one of the world's highest levels of
intellectual property protection. Directives regarding rental, and
duration of protection for producers, increased from 25 to 50 years,
came into force July 1 1995, with a one year retroactive provision.
This effectively ended the trade in unauthorised compilations by the
likes of Elvis Presley and the Beatles.

Germany had 600 CD rental shops as well as 2,000 video rental shops
which also rented some CDs before the new legislation was introduced.
The new law affords producers and companies the exclusive right to
sanction or prohibit rental. To date none has given approval for the
rental of their recordings. Rental CDs typically featured chart
repertoire and usually were rented out at $1.50 a time. An estimated
90% of them were taped.

Currency fluctuations and price differentials sparked an increase in
parallel imports to Germany in 1995. Most of the product came from
Sweden, because the value of the Swedish Krona fell steeply against the
Deutschmark, and also from Britain and Italy. Industry estimates
suggested the retail value of parallel imports could be over $140m in
1995, up from $125m the previous year.

Piracy

Piracy rates continued to fall, however, mostly due to the effective
enforcement of a new copyright law in Poland, which had long been a
major source of pirate product. Improved co-operation between Polish
and German customs officials has also helped stem the flow of
counterfeit material from eastern Europe. However, pirate material
continues to filter in from Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech and Slovak
republics and even Kazakhstan. The pirate market was worth an estimated
$97m in 1994, down from $153m in 1993. It is expected to drop again in
1995.

Until recently a so-called "protection gap" existed in German law,
whereby bootlegs of concerts by EU citizens were allowed to be sold in
Germany if they were recorded in countries which were not signatories
of the Rome convention - notably the US. This loophole was all but
eliminated by a European Court ruling in a case involving Phil Collins,
which immediately took hundreds of thousands of bootleg CDs out of
circulation. The protection gap was finally closed on January 1 1996
with the harmonisation of EU member states' copyright legislation.

LA CIENEGA RULING RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT EFFECTIVENESS OF US COPYRIGHT

On October 12 1995 the American songwriting and music publishing
community received the troubling news that the US Supreme Court had
declined to review the La Cienega Music vs ZZ Top case. The US High
Court's refusal to hear the case has left undisturbed the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals ruling, which earlier this year placed a cloud over
the copyright status of virtually every musical composition released on
a phono-record in the US prior to January 1 1978.

The National Music Publishers' Association (NMPA) and other American
songwriter and music publisher groups are currently spearheading the
effort to convince Congress to revise the US Copyright Act in order to
thwart the potentially disastrous effects of La Cienega. However, until
Congress acts, it will be very difficult for copyright owners and
proprietors to be sure of the viability of their pre-1978 music
copyrights, or to enforce their rights in such works through litigation
within the Ninth Circuit (which includes the state of California)
without placing such copyrights at risk.

In order to understand the full implications of La Cienega some
background information on a rather esoteric area of US Copyright Law is
necessary. Many aspects of copyright protection for works created prior
to January 1 1978 remain subject to the "old" US Copyright Act of 1909.
That act did not state with clarity whether the distribution of a
phonorecord would constitute publication of the musical work embodied
in that phonorecord. However, the music industry came to rely on the
interpretation of the US Copyright Office that such distribution did
not constitute publication. This view was confirmed by the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals sitting in New York in the case of Rosette vs
Rainbow Record Mfg Corp (1976).

For close to twenty years, therefore, it has been considered as a
settled issue in the US that musical works distributed on phonorecords
prior to January 1 1978 were not thereby published. Thus, no copyright
notice for the musical composition embodied in each phonorecord was
required and no renewal of the musical work 28 years following such
first distribution of phonorecords was necessary in order to keep the
work out of the public domain.

The court in La Cienega however, reached the opposite conclusion. The
case involved rock band ZZ Top in a copyright infringement action
brought by the copyright owner of La Cienega Music regarding John Lee
Hooker's composition Boogie Chillin. The court found that Hooker's song
was in the public domain, having been published upon its first release
on phonorecord in the late 1940s - "published" being the key word here.
Under the 1909 Act, the court said, copyright in the work had to be
renewed 28 years later in order to preserve protection. Even if such
renewal had been properly filed, the court went on to say, the absence
of copyright notice for Boogie Chillin on the phonorecords had likely
placed the work into the public domain anyway. Such copyright notice
was virtually never included on phonorecords.

The effect of the Ninth Circuit's decision could be to decimate the
music community in the US. If left in place, the decision threatens to
bring chaos to the industry, throwing doubt on the holdings of music
publishers and threatening the rights of the authors of works published
before 1978. Already there is evidence that some copyright users may be
attempting to use the decision as an excuse not to pay royalties on
such compositions, under the presumption that the copyright owner will
not risk exposing the copyright through litigation to a finding that it
has fallen into the public domain. The failure of Congress to intervene
could easily spell disaster for thousands of songwriters and music
publishers in the US, and for their foreign counterparts whose works
have been embraced by the American public.

NMPA has made the overturning of this precedent its most important
legislative goal this year. While the American music publishing
industry supports wholeheartedly legislation currently pending before
Congress to extend the term of US copyright protection, and opposes
vehemently legislation which would unfairly diminish US performing
rights royalties for musical compositions, the preservation of
copyright protection itself on thousands upon thousands of pre-1978
compositions must command all our energies. We are both hopeful and
confident that supporters of intellectual property rights in Congress
will act in a timely manner to cut off the potentially devastating
effects of the Ninth Circuit's decision in La Cienega before they have
a chance to take hold.

DUTCH MEDIA COMPANY WEGENER BUYS ARCADE

Dutch media publisher Wegener is to take over Netherlands' independent
record and media company Arcade. Wegener is paying around Fl400m
($186m) for Arcade. The deal should be concluded by late January,
effectively retroactive to January 1, 1996. The merged company will be
called Wegener Arcade.

Arcade is one of the world's last remaining major independent record
label groups. It is second only to PolyGram in the Dutch market, has
about a 1% market share in Germany and a 7% share of the compilation
market in France. Wegener is a publishing group with expanding
interests in electronic media. The company expects 1995 earnings of
$596.5m and a 15% increase in net profits to about $37m.

After the merger, Arcade's current activities will be grouped into a
division called Arcade Entertainment Group, which will be managed by
Arcade's current president H Heinsbroek. At present Arcade comprises
four main divisions: music, media, retail and film/video and employs
700 people. Arcade revenues in the 1994/95 fiscal year to March 31 were
$247.3m, with net profits of $10.5m.

The Arcade Music Company (AMC) has three divisions, the record company
CNR Music, the classical label Vanguard Classics and the Arcade TV
marketing company. CNR Music was set up in the 1940s and owns the
world's largest Dutch-language catalogue as well as representing
artists such as Barry White, Earth, Wind & Fire, The Commodores and
Depeche Mode in the Netherlands. Vanguard Classics represents artists
including Alfred Brendel and Arno Bornkamp and is the largest
independent classical label in the Netherlands. Arcade TV has marketed
compilations in Europe for 20 years.

AMC has offices in the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Spain, Sweden,
Germany, Austria and France. It expects to open an office in Finland
this year and is in talks with an Italian company about forming a joint
venture. Arcade signed the first central European licensing agreement
involving an independent label with Dutch authors' society STEMRA
effective July 1 1995. The three year deal covered the sale of
international repertoire from the group's labels on MC and CD.

The Arcade Media Group (AMG) is the largest commercial radio group in
the Netherlands. It includes three radio stations, two commercial
television stations, the cable channel TV 10 Gold, which shows mainly
American and British programmes, and the 24-hour Music Factory channel,
currently available to 3m homes. AMG also publishes four magazines
linked to the radio and television stations and to Arcade's record
shops.

The Arcade Retail Group consists of two wholesalers and the Music Store
chain of over 70 record shops in the Netherlands, which aims to expand
to 100 outlets within two years. The Arcade Film & Video division was
set up after the group bought CNR Film & Video and exists to exploit
films through all media. It currently has offices in the Netherlands
and Belgium and aims to expand via AMC's network of offices.

IFPI AND FIMI LINK TO FIGHT PIRACY IN ITALY

International Record Producers' Association IFPI is to mount a new
campaign against soundcarrier piracy in Italy together with the local
trade association FIMI.

Music & Copyright estimates the value of pirate product sold in Italy
was equivalent to 27% of the legitimate market in 1994. Pirate sales
rose that year by 38% to $142.2m, according to IFPI. Sales of pirate
MCs rose by 15% and sales of pirate CDs rose by 150% from 1993. Pirate
product represented 32% of the market in unit terms. Because of this
high level of piracy, IFPI estimates that record companies are losing
nearly $150m a year.

IFPI says that Italy accounts for 44% of the 47m pirate recordings in
the European Union (EU) and that Italy exported 15m bootleg CDs in
1994. According to IFPI, half of all MCs, which account for a third of
all recordings sold in Italy, are illegal copies. This seriously
affects Italian artists because 60% of all cassettes sold are of
Italian repertoire. IFPI says 20% of CDs sold in Italy are pirated.
These figures make Italy the fifth largest pirate music market in the
world.

IFPI argues that the high level of piracy has meant that companies have
not invested in their Italian operations. In 1991 Italy's share of
legitimate sales in the EU was 7%. This had fallen to 5% in 1994. The
growth of the Italian soundcarrier market has also been dramatically
affected by piracy. Between 1991 and 1994 the legitimate market shrank
by 20% to $535m, whereas legitimate sales rose 9% over the same period
in the rest of the EU.

IFPI and FIMI will open the offices of their new anti-piracy operation
Federation Against Music Piracy (FPM) in Milan later this month. IFPI
and FIMI and the six major record companies are to spend $1m on the
anti-piracy office. FPM aims to improve law enforcement in Italy. IFPI
points out, for example, that no convictions are expected in five cases
it began in 1994 until 1999 at the earliest. Similarly, a January 1995
change in the law, which closed a loophole and criminalised illegal
recordings of live performances, is ineffective unless authors' groups
use their legal rights to secure a long term bans on the licensing in
Italy of such recordings. FPM will help them do this.

FPM will also improve information gathering about the trade in
counterfeit and bootleg product in Italy. It is thought organised crime
is involved and that most of the pirate market is in the south of the
country with only 26% in the north. Naples is thought to be the centre
of the trade and the entry point for material from North Africa and
eastern Europe.

IFPI cites the example of Spain as evidence that anti-piracy campaigns
can work. In 1984 the piracy rate in Spain was 34%. This fell to 5% by
1989 after a concerted campaign and stronger copyright legislation, and
by 1995 piracy had been virtually eliminated.

encourage private sector broadcasters to follow the BBC's example. The
Bill, which is expected to become law in July, also ends the numerical
limit (at present 35) on licences any one company may hold. Instead
companies will be restricted to a 15% share in "radio points", a system

HIGH-COST NYNEX WANTS TELEWEST-TYPE SAVINGS

The restructuring plan unveiled on Monday by Nynex CableComms, which
involves the shedding of 11 per cent of the 2,900 strong workforce,
follows months of criticism from City analysts that the company is the
least efficient of UK cable operators.

Nynex hopes that the cutting of 310 jobs - through a mixture of
sackings, voluntary redundancies and natural wastage - and a saving of
between #7 million and #10 million a year, will enable it to reach
operating cashflow breakeven by the end of this year.

The company said that more than 70 per cent of the job cuts resulted
from a #25 million investment in information-technology systems to
handle areas such as subscriber management and telesales.  The axe is
falling heaviest in sales and marketing, reflecting a move away from
door-to-door sales towards telesales, which Nynex regards as more
efficient (they accounted for a quarter of sales in 1995).

Senior management will be cut by 20 per cent.  John Killian, who has
just taken over as chief executive, will not be replaced in his old
role of chief operating officer.  Strategy director Sally Davis, who
drew up the restructuring plan with Killian and chief financial officer
Nicholas Mearing-Smith, is moving to the parent company's New York
office to undertake a similar role.  There was only one senior
casualty:  Peter Morse, executive director of the southern block of
franchises.

Nynex had become increasingly sensitive to criticism from industry
analysts that its cost-base was much higher than that of all other UK
operators.  Given its size, one might have expected lower costs through
economies of scale.

The company's net operating expenses for staff, marketing and
administration were 132 per cent of its revenues for the nine months to
end-September 1995.  The figure compares with one of 80 per cent for
TeleWest, the UK's biggest cable operator.

The UK Nynex company grew from 200 people four years ago to 2,900 by
the end of 1995.  As one senior executive put it, ``we grew by 300 too
many.  That's not so bad.  A cable company bases its growth on an
expected customer base and expected revenues.  We did not get the
television customers we expected, but the whole industry expected
more.''

In the past, Nynex has justified its position as the big spender of UK
cable by saying that its customer service and churn rate -- the
proportion of subscribers who quit the system -- are the best in the
industry and that it is counter-productive to rush to breakeven on the
basis of poorer service.  The company's churn rate may no longer be the
best, but it is close to the best and, at 30.3 per cent, contrasts
strongly with TeleWest's 45.7 per cent.

On the other hand, Nynex's penetration -- the number of subscribers
expressed as a percentage of those who could take the service because
the cable passes their homes -- is much lower than TeleWest's: 18.9 per
cent against TeleWest's 21.4 per cent and the industry average of 20.8
per cent.  Nynex knows that it must increase its sales, but suggests
that the churn rather than the penetration figures may turn out to be
the biggest contributor to long-term success.

Nynex's spending on customer service is arguably well-justified.
Arguably, too, TeleWest should have spent far more to keep its churn
lower and, indeed, has recently increased its spending.  According to
Mearing-Smith, ``it costs you money to get to where Nynex has in terms
of customer service.  We don't want to lose what we have, but we need
to make it more economic.''

Nynex hopes to reduce the cost of sales, marketing and administration
to 50 per cent of its revenue-base by the end of this year, the level
it expects TeleWest to achieve.

Nynex's restructuring could be be seen as part of a wider trend within
the industry.  As one senior analyst put it, ``it's not a general
panic, but there is a sharpening of focus on why cable television is
still not selling well.''  Last year, TeleWest carried out a small
restructuring in its London South operations, shedding 20 jobs.

The Nynex moves to some extent reflect a change in corporate culture
resulting from the UK company turning itself from a wholly-owned
foreign subsidiary of a monolithic regional Bell telephone company into
a public company last June (though major policy decisions still have to
go through the slow process of gaining US approval).

The company was keen to dispel any impression that the restructuring
represented the opening shots of a new management style: it was purely
a coincidence that the moves were announced during the week of
Connell's departure.

As Mearing-Smith pointed out, the restructuring plan was drawn up in
the wake of a ``priority resourcing'' study carried out by Coopers &
Lybrand, the management consultants.  This was started in October,
before it was clear that Connell's tour of duty would end at the turn
of the year.

Mearing-Smith said that the restructuring was ``the kind of grown-up
behaviour shown by big companies and shareholders should feel good
about it.''

Not all observers accept the merits of centralisation.  One analyst,
Andrew Walsh of NatWest Markets, said: ``I don't think it is a good
thing.  At this stage of the operation, it makes sense to put
management resources as close to the franchises being managed as
possible.''

Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes that, even with
the changes, Nynex will find it hard to reach breakeven by the end of
the year.

Even so, analysts generally welcomed the moves -- Nynex was, after all,
only doing what they had criticised it for not doing in the past.
However, the share price fell 2p on the day of the announcement (Monday
morning), closing at 105p.  It fell further on Tuesday to an all-time
low of 104p.

Nynex plans: Nynex is centralising the management of its three regional
franchise blocks in the south, the Midlands and the Manchester area.
Departmental executives will report to their central chief rather than
to regional bosses.  Nynex believes that one central sales organisation
covering all franchises and focusing purely on sales is more efficient
than having sales undertaken regionally and combined with marketing.

The main information system which is provoking the staff cuts is the
IBM-based ICMS integrated cable-television and telephony subscriber-
management system, which the company introduced last year.

The company is also adding a workforce-management system, designed to
improve efficiency between the sales and installation arms, and an
automated voice-response unit to handle all customer calls, directing
them to the relevant departments.  It plans to introduce tele-marketing
software which will be integrated with the ICMS system.

UK GOLD COMES OFF VIDEOTRON SYSTEMS

UK Gold, the Astra satellite entertainment channel, has refused
Videotron the right to distribute it on its cable networks in a bitter
row over carriage terms.

The channel, which carries archive BBC and Thames programmes, will come
off on February 12, losing 89,000 subscribers, two per cent of its
total satellite and cable subscription.

UK Gold, the most popular new-media channel among adults outside the
BSkyB stable, has told Videotron that it should be carried on
Videotron's lowest tier of channels, ensuring that it is seen by
virtually all subscribers.

Videotron, which owns networks in West and North London and in
Southampton, refuses to move it from a higher tier, where there are
fewer subscribers and therefore less revenue for UK Gold.

The row results from Videotron's policy of putting so-called ``basic''
channels into different tiers rather than a single ``big-basic''
package, which is the industry norm.

UK Gold said this week that is was prepared to compromise on its
principle that it should be received
by at least 95 per cent of an operator's customers and would accept
being put in a more restricted tier -- but only if Videotron were to pay
a higher per-subscriber fee to compensate it for a smaller reach.

It said that Videotron, whose packaging approach has upset several
programmers, is being inflexible.  It sent a solicitor's letter to the
cable company on Monday.

UK Gold used to be carried on a more restricted tier under the terms of
a contract which expired in November 1994.  Talks for a new contract
have dragged on ever since, with the channel being carried on a ``good
faith'' basis.  UK Gold said that Videotron had been paying it much
less than the 29p per subscriber per month it typically charges other
operators.

The channel said that Videotron only recently moved it from the highest
tier to the middle (standard) tier, despite a legal obligation to do so
before the expiry date of the last contract.

UK Gold is also angry that Videotron has been selling the channel on an
o-la-carte basis to people in the bottom tier -- illegally, in UK Gold's
view -- charging subscribers #1 but handing over only a few pence to the
channel.

Videotron, which is the fourth biggest cable operator in the UK, said
that UK Gold is asking it to pay 10p more than other operators pay --
that is, 39p.  UK Gold, however, said that it had put forward a range
of options with different prices, most of which were below 39p.

Videotron said that the price was unfair and suggested that the channel
was being punitive because of its refusal to carry UK Gold's sister
channel, the women's channel UK Living.  UK Gold denied the linkage.

Benjamin Ball, Videotron's director of programming (who, ironically,
helped to create UK Gold), said: ``We object to the idea that UK Gold
is trying to restrict our ability to offer our customers flexibility.
We want to carry the channel, but we are not prepared to sacrifice long-
term consumer benefits for short-term benefits to UK Gold.''

Videotron now runs three tiers: in ascending order, Option One,
Standard Pack and Super Pack.  The Standard Pack also carries the
channels of Option One, and the Super Pack also carries the channels of
both lower packs.

UK Gold wants to be carried in Option One, which contains only two
satellite channels, Sky One and Sky News, the only channels to be
watched by all Videotron subscribers.  At present, it is carried in the
Standard Pack and the Super Pack which, together, reach about 85 per
cent of subscribers.  The channel's coverage increases to 87 per cent --
89,000 subscribers -- because of Option One viewers who take it o la
carte.

Bruce Steinberg, chief executive of UK Gold, said: ``I feel bummed out
about disappointing the viewers, but someone's got to draw the line
somewhere.

``We are offering Videotron more flexibility.  We are even prepared to
allow the company to sell the channel o la carte, which means we have
to go back to other operators to give them the same flexibility.  But
our bottom line is that Videotron must pay a premium for the
flexibility.

``We hope that Videotron will reconsider its position.''

He said that the channel had little time for Videotron's controversial
packaging, which was designed to maximise consumer choice of
programming.  ``I would feel comfortable about the packaging if
Videotron`s penetration was double the industry's.  But I don't see any
evidence that this idea has improved penetration.''

Videotron's penetration on October 1 was 21.7 per cent, against an
industry average of 20.8 per cent.

Videotron argues that its three-tier approach has boosted penetration
and helped to cut churn to one of the lowest levels in the country, an
annualised 27.8 per cent (NMM 13:43).  Benjamin Ball, Videotron's head
of programming, said: ``Our strategy has been in place for more than
two years and has proved very successful.''

Steinberg said that he is concerned that the packaging of channels is
becoming the ``latest panacea'' to cure the UK cable industry's poor
cable-television penetration.  Like other programmers, he suggested
that what is needed is for operators to improve customer service and
marketing.

UK FURY OVER PLANS TO CHANGE TV DIRECTIVE

The UK's Department of National Heritage reacted angrily to several
amendments to the European Union's transfrontier broadcasting directive
which were adopted this week by the European Parliament's culture
committee.

The DNH described as ``just bloody stupid'' an amendment which would
give jurisdiction over a broadcaster to the countries receiving the
channels instead of to the country in which the broadcaster is
established.

The DNH said that the amendment goes against the underlying principle
of the directive: this is that member states should accept broadcasts
which are properly licensed for distribution in another member state.

The UK was also angry at the latest in a long line of attempts to
tighten up the directive's requirement that channels should have at
least 51 per cent of programming made in Europe.  The DNH said that
amendments passed by the committee went against a ``political
agreement'' between the member states to stick with the existing
wording.

However, the council of culture ministers, which was responsible for
the wording of the directive sent to the parliamentary committee, will
get a further chance to quash the changes.

The amendment made this week by the parliamentary committee threw out
the controversial phrases ``where practicable'' and ``progressively on
the basis of suitable criteria'', which the UK and some other states
have used to justify a relaxed interpretation of the quota requirement.
 They replaced them with a clear three-year timetable for compliance.

Another amendment disqualifies certain new types of light entertainment
programming from counting towards a broadcaster's 51-per-cent quota.

However, the DNH welcomed the committee's rejection of several other
controversial amendments, including one which would have banned
advertising breaks during programmes aimed at children, and another
which would have required a health warning before advertisements for
alcoholic drinks on television.

The amended directive will be considered by the full parliament on
February 12.  But the committee has still not finished going through
the 225 amendments proposed by euro-MPs: another 20 will be considered
at a meeting next Tuesday.  The committee has so far adopted 51
amendments.

The full parliament is expected to reject some amendments before
sending a revised draft to the council of culture ministers.  The
council will then attempt to reach a so-called ``common position'' on
the amended draft, which must then be submitted for final approval by
the parliament.

The most controversial of all the 1989 directive's provisions has been
the one requiring quotas of European-originated programmes.  After many
arguments between the UK which believes that the quotas should be
scrapped completely, and France, which believes they should be
tightened, the culture ministers eventually opted, at the end of last
year, to retain the directive's existing wording (NMM 13:42).

The DNH said that it is ``absolutely opposed'' to the latest amendment
under which certain light-entertainment programmes would not count
towards the quotas.  Talk shows made in Europe, for instance, would not
be eligble.  The DNH said that the amendment, if adopted, would remove
``a lot of investment and employment which is generated by these
shows'' in Europe, and would leave only drama, documentaries and films
to contribute to the quotas.   At present, many general entertainment
channels balance the (mainly US) films they show with European talk
shows.

A senior commission official denied that the amendment would hit soap
operas such as Coronation Street and EastEnders, despite the fears of
some UK regulators and television executives.  He said that these would
still count towards the quotas.  However, he added that the council and
the parliament are heading towards a collision on quotas and that there
would ``have to be a compromise'' to resolve it.

Neither the UK nor the commission is happy with the amendment which
switches jurisdiction of broadcasters to the countries receiving the
broadcasts.  The DNH said: ``If you give the receiving country
jurisdiction, you're multiplying the number of countries with
jurisdiction in a way which would make the whole thing unworkable.''

A senior commission official said that ``it is not to be taken for
granted that the parliament will accept what the committee has
proposed''.  It is thought likely that the amendment will be rejected,
either by the parliament or when the draft is returned to the council
of ministers.

The UK is also opposed to an amendment which would extend the scope of
the directive to cover ``point-to-point'' services, such as video-on-
demand.  It said that these services should properly be considered
separately under telecoms legislation.

TELEWEST CHIEF LEAVES

TeleWest's chief operating officer Danny Bryan has left the company
abruptly.  He is being replaced by former telecommunications head Lynn
Rexroth, who had been expected to return to shareholder US West to take
up a post in Japan.

Sources close to the company said that Bryan, who joined TeleWest from
shareholder TeleCommunications Inc a year ago, had found it hard to
adapt to the move from a well-established US cable operation to the
more start-up nature of the UK company.

GOLDEN STRANDS

UK Gold is creating three programme strands, which it describes as
``mini-channels'', as part of a plan to gear up for the launch of
digital satellite television.  The three strands may eventually be spun-
off to form separate digital channels operating under the UK Gold
umbrella.

From the middle of next month, the channel will have a two-hour
upmarket drama slot on Sunday nights, ``Masterpiece'', which will show
such series as I Claudius and Elizabeth R.

Earlier on Sunday nights, there will be a ``Showcase'' slot featuring
variety programmes such as Morcambe and Wise.  On Saturday nights, the
channel will run a drama slot, ``Spotlight'', covering themes such as
war, cops, spies and private eyes.

Further sub-brands will be based on situation comedy, science fiction,
action drama and alternative comedy.

LICENCE FEE TO SUPPORT NEW ARD, ZDF CHANNELS

German public-service broadcasters ARD and ZDF will launch two new
cable and satellite channels in the next two years, one aimed at
children and the other a parliamentary channel.

The new channels will be funded from an increase in the licence fee of
DM4.45 a month (#2) which was proposed last week by the Kommission zur
Ermittlung des Finanzbedarss der Rundfunkanstalten (KEF), a commission
set up by the state governments to advise on the funding of ARD and
ZDF.

The commission is understood to have recommended that, out of the
DM4.45 increase, 15 pfennigs should be set aside to fund the children's
channel, and 7 pfennigs for the parliamentary channel.

The increase has still to be approved by the 16 state parliaments which
tend to rubber-stamp KEF proposals.

The news is a blow to Nickelodeon Germany, the children's channel
recently launched by US programmer Viacom and German toy manufacturer
Ravensburger.  Nickelodeon is Germany's only children's channel, and
has had considerable success in gaining cable carriage, despite a
continuing capacity crisis (NMM 13:42).

The launch of the new public-service children's channel, probably
during 1997, will offer stiff competition for viewers.  But it is also
likely to lead to serious cuts in Nickelodeon's cable distribution.
Distribution was granted by most media authorities only on a temporary
basis, in anticipation of the possible launch of an ARD/ZDF channel.

The idea of a public-service children's channel has long been mooted as
a means for ARD and ZDF to exploit their extensive libraries of
children's programming and to develop new programmes.  ZDF proposed
launching a children's channel in 1993, although at that time it was
being talked of as a pay service (Satellite TV Finance 4:19).  ARD
regional channel Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) also looked at launching
a children's channel (NMM 12:21).

The plans foundered because the two broadcasters are legally prevented
from launching advertising-supported channels.  Under the present plan,
the channel would be funded entirely from licence-fee revenues.

The idea of a parliamentary channel was put forward by WDR last year.  A
senior ZDF executive said this week that he was surprised that the idea
has received the support of the KEF, ``because we didn't really want
it.''  He said that ZDF had gone along with the proposal primarily
because it could be used to strengthen the argument for a licence-fee
increase:  ``Every politician is eager to see himself on TV'' (NMM
13:35).

According to the ZDF executive, the parliamentary channel could be
ready for launch late this year, with the children's channel following
early in 1997.

ARD and ZDF are desperate for an increase in the licence fee, because
the success of private commercial channels such as RTL TV, Sat 1 and
Pro 7 in recent years has led to heavy dents in the public-service
broadcasters' advertising revenues.  The viewing share of ARD's main
(national) network fell from 31 per cent in 1990 to 14.6 per cent for
1995, and ZDF's share fell from 29 per cent to 14.7 per cent.

The proposed licence-fee increase is in line with the amount requested
by the two broadcasters, but is being described as ``good news for ZDF
and bad news for ARD'', although ARD would get the larger share: DM2.35
against ZDF's DM2.05 (with another 5 pfennigs going to the media
authorities to fund their work).

ARD argues that it should have a much larger share of the increase
because, whereas ZDF is just one station, ARD has to support its
network of so-called ``third'' channels (regional television stations)
and also 11 radio stations, employing a total staff of 23,000.  This is
recognised in the way that the existing licence fee of DM23.80 per
month is split 70:30 in favour of ARD.

A senior ARD executive said this week that, if the KEF's recommendation
is ratified by the state parliaments in March, the broadcaster could
decide to take legal action against it.

The media authorities are also dissatisfied with the KEF proposal to
increase their funding.  The 5 pfennigs rise represents 1.12 per cent
of the overall increase, against the 2-per-cent share which the media
authorities take of the existing licence fee.

Any dispute over the apportioning of the increase is likely to lead to
delays in the launch of the two channels.

Further delays could result if, as seems likely, Nickelodeon takes
legal action against attempts to eject it from cable networks in favour
of the new public-service children's channel.

In several states, the channel is carried during daytime hours in the
cable slot used by the Franco-German public-service cultural channel
Arte, which broadcasts only in the evenings.  However, these states
have granted Nickelodeon cable carriage only until the end of the year,
in anticipation of the possibility that ARD and ZDF would want cable
carriage for their own children's channel.

Because the ARD/ZDF channel will be a public-service one, it will
automatically qualify for ``must-carry'' status in all German states.
Even in North Rhine Westphalia, the state which granted Nickelodeon's
licence, precedence will be given to the ARD/ZDF channel.

RTL-TV DRAWS UP PLANS FOR GERMAN NEWS CHANNEL

RTL TV, the top-rating German general entertainment channel owned by
Bertelsmann and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion, is
considering launching a 24-hour German news channel.

The channel could launch in 1997 and would be broadcast in analogue
form via cable and satellite and would later move to digital.  RTL has
just launched a feasibility study on the planned channel.

RTL has also approached international broadcasters, including the US
network ABC, about providing foreign news coverage.  It is talking to
interactive software suppliers, such as Microsoft Corporation, about
the possibility of the new channel incorporating interactivity and
``news-on-demand'' facilities.

Hans Mahr, RTL director of information and sports, who is in charge of
the project, said that the main reason for launching a news channel is
that RTL correspondents are gathering far more news than can be used on
a general entertainment channel.  He estimated that the channel is able
to broadcast only one tenth of the news it produces.

Mahr said that the channel ``must be basically a German channel.''  Pan-
European channels such as Euronews ``would never succeed'' because news
is viewed ``from the perspective of where you live.''  Although the
channel is to be German-oriented, it would need foreign partners, such
as ABC, to give it an ``international context''.

Several German media regulators and television executives this week
questioned whether there is a market in Germany for another news
channel.  One regulator pointed out that national news channel n-tv is
``still struggling, despite the support of big players'' -- its US
shareholders Time Warner and CNN.  In 1995, n-tv's audience share was
0.3 per cent.

In addition to n-tv, Germany already has another national news and
information channel in Vox, the ``infotainment'' channel owned by News
Corporation, Bertelsmann and Canal Plus -- although the channel has
dropped a lot of its original news and information programming in a bid
to boost its ratings (NMM 13:30).

The RTL channel would also be competing with pan-European news channels
CNN, BBC World and Euronews; pan-European business channels NBC Super
Channel and European Business News; and the widely-respected news and
information coverage of public-service broadcasters ARD and ZDF.  ARD's
8pm Tagesschau is still the most-watched news programme on German
television.

Mahr said that ARD's and ZDF's news coverage is ``all right for older
viewers who are used to that kind of presentation'', but that for
younger viewers a different style is needed.

Not all German commentators were against the idea of another news
channel.  One senior regulator said that the idea of the channel could
``make sense'' if viewers could receive the information when they
wanted it.  This would be ``a new form of bringing information to the
people.''

A former n-tv executive, who now works for a pan-European channel, said
that RTL would need only some new studios and perhaps 20 extra staff to
produce the channel for #20 million a year, which ``is not so much
money for RTL.''  He expected the new channel's approach to be typical
of RTL -- ``a little more bloodthirsty, a little more scandalous, a
little more mass market-oriented than n-tv.''

Most commentators agreed that that the channel would struggle if it
were supported by advertising alone.  However, several commentators
said that the channel would make sense if presented as part of a
digital subscription package, especially if it were the only news
channel in the market offering interactivity.

One senior ZDF executive said that if the channel is of a high
standard, and especially if it brings in good foreign news, ``then we
are in really deep trouble, because this is the last area where we
still lead.''

ARD AND ZDF LOSE SHARE AS PRO 7 SURGES FORWARD

German public-service channels ARD and ZDF continued to lose audience
share to their commercial rivals in 1995, with the two market-leading
channels RTL TV and Sat 1 maintaining their 1994 shares and the Kirch-
backed Pro 7 continuing its growth, particularly among children among
whom it is the most-viewed channel.

ARD and ZDF executives were this week comforting themselves that Sat 1
had not made bigger audience-share gains in the last two months of the
year, when Sat 1 introduced a raft of new big-budget programming.
However, one ZDF executive admitted that it is still ``far too early''
to judge the success of Sat 1's new schedules.

The executive warned against a too-literal reading of the figures,
which are skewed by the fact that they do not take into account the
distribution available to each channel nor the number of hours per day
in which a channel broadcasts.

The figures, from GfK, show that RTL-TV took a 17.6-per-cent share of
viewing in 1995, compared with 14.7 per cent for both Sat-1 and ZDF,
14.6 per cent for ARD and 9.9 per cent for Pro 7.

TERRESTRIAL BBC WORLD

BBC World, the corporation's 24-hour pan-European cable and satellite
news channel, last week began a four-week period of terrestrial
distribution to five million homes in the Berlin Brandenburg area of
Germany.

The channel is being distributed for a trial period on the frequency of
ORB, the ARD regional station for the area.  According to BBC World,
this is the first time a foreign channel has been given distribution by
an ARD station.

RTL TV ABANDONS BID TO STOP HOT BROADCASTING

Germany's leading private television channel RTL TV said this week that
it is unlikely to challenge a decision by the Bavarian constitutional
court to allow the controversial home-shopping channel HOT to transmit
to German satellite homes.

Two lower courts had upheld RTL's complaint that the channel breached
German broadcasting legislation.  But the higher court, the
Verfassungsgerichtshof, ruled just before Christmas that HOT could
continue to transmit on Astra 1d to the whole of Germany.

RTL could appeal to the German federal constitutional court but says
this is unlikely because legal action is likely to be overtaken by
changes which are expected to be made to German media law which would
liberalise tele-shopping.

When HOT (Home Order Television), owned by Thomas Kirch's Pro-7 and
mail order company Quelle, was granted a licence to broadcast by
satellite to the whole of Germany by the Bavarian media authority on
December 14, RTL appealed against the decision.  Bavaria had previously
given the channel a licence for distribution on two Bavarian cable
networks.

RTL claimed that Bavaria's media law did not give it the jurisdiction
to license home-shopping channels as tele-shopping did not count as
broadcasting.

Bavaria is to change its media legislation with a new clause expected
to take effect on March 1 that will allow the media authority to
license interactive media such as shopping channels that might fall
outside the strict definition of ``broadcasting''.

Under both the European Union's transfrontier directive and Germany's
Rundfunkstaatsvertrag, tele-shopping channels are theoretically allowed
on air for only one hour a day, but Bavaria's media authority -- like
the UK's Independent Television Commission (ITC) -- has interpreted the
rule more liberally than some other states (NMM 13:41).  The EU
directive is now being revised (see story on page 3) and is expected to
allow home shopping channels on air 24 hours a day.

RTL claims that its legal action was not in vain: ``We've had two
courts saying that HOT is in breach of German media law.  I think it
was important to show this.''

RTL's chief executive Helmut Thoma has said that his shareholders CLT
and Bertelsmann are interested in setting up a tele-shopping channel
themselves and that the Bavarian media authority is giving HOT an
unfair competitive advantage by allowing it to transmit nationally
before the law has been changed.

HOT has also just been granted a licence from the UK's ITC.  HOT said
that it had applied in late November in order to hedge its bets in case
it was not allowed to uplink from Bavaria.

FRENCH REPORT QUESTIONS EUTELSAT DIGITAL PLAN

A report on the future of digital satellite television in France has
questioned the feasibility of the digital package proposed by French
public broadcaster France Television and commercial station TF1.

The report, from national audit body the Cour des Comptes, said that
the partners lack the technological and commercial expertise to operate
a digital bouquet.  It recommends that they consider joining the rival
package of Canal Plus and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion.

Georges Vanderchmitt, the former director general of France 2 who wrote
the report, also suggested that France Telecom should abandon plans to
launch its next television satellite, Telecom 2d, and change its role
to that of satellite service provider, selling on capacity leased on
Eutelsat and Astra satellites.

The report, published last week, signals an increasing commercial
awareness in French governmental thinking.  It acknowledges the
importance of the Astra satellite system and of international
commercial considerations.  In the past, French administrations had
discouraged channels from using Astra satellites.

French telecommunications minister Francois Fillon said that he
favoured a wide alliance of private and public companies to launch
digital satellite television and enable France to catch up with the UK
and Germany.

Vanderchmitt said that public-service broadcasters such as Arte and
France Television as well as TF1 should negotiate with Canal Plus and
CLT for access to their Astra digital packages rather than press ahead
with plans for rival offerings on Eutelsat's Hot Bird satellites.
Canal Plus and CLT are due to launch their digital bouquets by the end
of February.

TF1 and France Television set up a joint venture company late last year
to look into the possibility of a digital package on the Eutelsat
system.

Vanderchmitt urged France Telecom to follow Deutsche Telekom in
investing in Astra owner Societe Europeenne des Satellites.  But Fillon
said that a better option would be for private French companies to
invest in SES.

OPERATORS AND CHANNELS LAUNCH CABLE SURVEY

Cable-only programmers and the UK's top cable operators next week
launch an audience research project designed to give an accurate
picture of television viewing in cable homes.

The research is needed because the existing weekly cable and satellite
research from the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (Barb) does not
give viewing details for cable-only channels because its cable sample
is so small.

Although channels have taken Barb data and re-cast it to derive a
picture of cable-only viewing, they admit that the derived figures are
not reliable enough for firm conclusions to be drawn.

The programmers want hard data to help them sell advertising space.
The operators are also keen to have an accurate picture of cable-only
viewing as part of their armoury in carriage negotiations with
programmers.

The survey is being funded by the main cable operators, United Artists
Programming, the Independent Television Commission and the cable-only
channels Live TV, Channel One, SelecTV and Travel.

The fruits of the two-week survey should appear in March.  The backers
expect it to confirm the picture shown by their analysis of Barb data,
and by a recently published survey of cable viewing from the
Independent Television Commission, that viewers in cable homes watch
more new-media television than viewers in satellite dish homes.

The new research is designed to be as close to Barb methodology as
possible, even though it will be diary-based rather than use ``people
meters'' like Barb.  Diary research is generally thought to
underestimate viewing to small channels, because respondents forget
that they have spent time watching them.  The research is being carried
out by Barb contractor RSMB.

The ITC survey, carried out over two weeks in October by Continental
Research, showed that the share of viewing taken by cable and satellite
channels in cable homes was 39.6 per cent.  This compares with a Barb
figure of 34.6 per cent for the same two weeks, according to an
analysis by New Media Markets.  The Barb figure covers cable and
satellite homes, but mainly satellite homes.

David Brennan, research director at United Artists Programming, said
that his own analysis of RSMB's Barb research showed three key
differences between viewing in cable homes and viewing in dish homes.

First, cable viewers watch more television than their satellite
counterparts.

Second, they spend a greater proportion of their time watching non-
terrestrial channels.

Third, more than half of children's viewing is of non-terrestrial
channels.

Brennan cautioned that such conclusions are based on a very small
sample.  Although Barb's cable and satellite sample is designed to be
demographically representative and reflects Barb's establishment
survey, the sub-sections of cable and satellite viewers are not in
themselves representative of the cable and satellite universes.

So, according to Brennan, when adjustments are made to the cable sample
to ensure that it is representative, its size is reduced from 180 to
90.  With such a small sample, there is a greater likelihood of
distortion, particularly with viewing for small channels and among
demographic sub-groups, such as children.

He said that the suggestion that cable viewers view differently from
satellite viewers needs to be supported by hard evidence, initially
through the new survey but eventually through Barb, when its cable
sample is increased as cable subscription in the UK grows.

``By the end of this year, the cable element in Barb should be about
300 homes which should be enough to allow us to look at it
separately,'' said Brennan.

He offered three main reasons why cable viewers might watch more non-
terrestrial channels than satellite viewers.

First, there are more channels to choose from.  Second, there is a much
greater penetration of second set-top boxes in cable homes than of
second satellite receivers in dish homes.  Third, cable viewers are
able to move from terrestrial to non-terrestrial viewing using the same
remote-control handset, whereas satellite dish users generally need to
use two separate handsets.

The ITC survey, carried out by Continental Research, showed that the
viewing share taken by cable and satellite channels in cable homes was
39.6 per cent.  Earlier surveys gave a viewing figure of 34.9 per cent
for 1994 and 42.1 per cent in 1993.  Last year, the ITC suggested that
the sharp fall in cable viewing might have reflected the fact that
newer cable homes were less interested in cable television because they
had taken a cable service primarily for telephony.

The ITC, which is carrying out a review of the annual cable viewing
surveys which it (and its predecessor the Cable Authority) have
commissioned since 1990, admits that it has found some of the research
implausible.  This year's survey suggested that the upmarket European
Business News channel was more popular in lower-class homes than in the
channel's target AB demographic group.  The ITC found this as hard to
believe as an earlier survey's suggestion of heavy viewing of the Adult
Channel among children.

Jon Davey, ITC director of cable and satellite, said:

"One of the problems has always been the relatively small size of the
sample and therefore there are difficulties in drawing too many
conclusions".  Although the survey involved 1,306 one-week diaries from
653 respondents, the number who watched individual channels was
sometimes in single figures.  The new cable research will involve a
sample of about 1,200 viewers.

The survey showed that Sky One has been overtaken by BSkyB premium film
channels as the most popular non-terrestrial channel in cable homes:
its share fell from 6.6 per cent to 4.8 per cent, while the Movie
Channel took top place with 5.8 per cent (up from 4.9 per cent) and Sky
Movies second place with 5.2 per cent (down from 5.4 per cent).

The NMM analysis of the dish-oriented Barb data for the same two weeks
in October shows several differences among channels.  UK Gold,
Nickelodoen, TCC, Discovery, Eurosport and MTV all did better in cable
homes.  Sky News did far worse.

Comparisons are difficult, partly because the ITC cable figures are for
all individuals aged two and above, whereas the Barb lower limit is
four years old.  Further, the ITC cable figures reflect each channel's
own universe of homes rather than all cable homes.  Barb covers all
cable and satellite homes.  For this reason, the NNM comparison covers
only those channels whose cable universe is close to (has at least 95
per cent of) the total cable universe.

Children's viewing of new-media channels in cable homes accounts for
well over half their total television viewing (54.4 per cent, compared
with 47.3 per cent in 1994).  Among younger children (2-9 year-olds),
the trend is more pronounced, with cable and satellite channels
accounting for 63.9 per cent of viewing.

The survey also showed that the penetration of second set-top boxes has
increased from 28.4 per cent of cable homes in 1994 to 34.8 per cent in
1995. The Movie Channel, Sky Movies, Sky Sports and the Cartoon Network
gained greater audience share among homes with multiple set-top boxes.

NETHOLD MAY NOT FIND PAY-SPORTS WILL EASILY BEAT A FREE CHANNEL

Can a free sports channel compete successfully against a premium sports
channel?  The UK experience suggests the battle would be one-sided,.
with the premium channel bringing in enough subscription revenue to make
it worth its while paying high prices for sports rights.

Scandinavia may well show that television life can be different that
Kinnevik's planned free sports channel, Sportkanalan, can beat
NetHold's recently-launched premium channel, Supersport.

There are many similarities between the two channels.  First, they are
not stand-alone channels, but intrinsic to the direct-to-home satellite
packages which the rival programmers are trying to push in the Nordic
market.

Second, each operator plans to run customised feeds to deliver opt-out
programming to the different language markets of the region.  Although
winter sports are popular in all Nordic countries, there are
differences of taste among the four countries.

Third, the channels look set to roll out very similar schedules: a
mixture of top sports and "wallpaper" sports.  Both have deep pockets
and are prepared to fork out the necessary cash for top sports events.

As the New Year gets under way, it does not appear that the premium
Supersport has significantly more top events than the free
Sportkanalan.  So it is hard to see how it will be able to establish
ascendancy quickly, at least not in the devastating way in which
British Sky Broadcasting's Sky Sports so easily pushed the established
Screensport into its terminal plight.

Supersport launched in Scandinavia last month using the Intelsat 601
satellite to reach cable head-ends.  Although it launched in analogue,
it will also become a key part of NetHold's planned digital satellite
package due to be launched on the Astra 1e satellite in the next few
months.  Sportkanalan is due to launch in March on the Scandinavian
Sirius satellite.

Most observers believe that the free Sportkanalan will be the likely
winner.  Few believe that there is room for two dedicated sports
channels in the Nordic market.  Some suggest that there may be room for
neither, given the presence of Eurosport Nordic, the regionalised
version of the pan-European Eurosport channel, which has the rights to
several top events, particularly in winter sports.

Peter Legaard, Nordic media director for Ogilvy and Mather, is
convinced that Sportkanalan stands the better chance in the region.  He
thinks that both channels have a good mix of programming and
advertisers will be pleased that they will appeal to young male
viewers.

But he believes that Sportkanalan will do better simply because it will
be free.  With more and more pay channels being offered, "there is a
limit to how much people will pay for television.  The time people
spend watching television will stay the same."

Scandinavian Broadcasting System's managing director Jan Steinmann
believes that Scandinavia is too small a market to handle and
advertising-supported sports channel.  He points to escalating rights
fees in the region and wonders if enough advertising revenue could ever
be raised to make a profit.  He claims that it is these high fees that
has convinced him to drop sports events on the cable and satellite
channel, Femmen.  It will now bill itself as the region's "sports - and
news-free" alternative.

Public-service broadcaster SVT and the Eurosport satellite channel are
also, not surprisingly, sceptical.

Bo Gentzel, SVT head of sport who turned down the job of managing
director at both new channels, does not believe that Scandinavia needs
more sports channels?  "We are not as television-mad as Americans.  I
don't think the audience for both channels will be very high.  Sweden
is half the size of London in terms of population.  So, we don't think
the channels will be a threat, but they will be good for the sports
idiot."

Eurosport also believes that Scandinavia is too small a television
market for three sports channels.  As a result, says Vincent Chupin,
the channel's head of sports acquisition, there may well not be enough
advertising to justify a free sports channel.

Both Supersport and Sportkanalan have had to agree shared deals with
established terrestrial channels, perhaps sub-licensing events from
them.  This is because so many rights in the region are already tied
up, and this will be the case until the end of decade when many come up
for renegotiation.

It is here that some observers believe Sportkanalan will have the
advantage, as Kinnevik already has a cosy relationship with terrestrial
broadcasters, especially SVT.  They argue that Kinnevik, as a powerful
regional programmer, is more knowledgable of the region's tastes.

Sportkanalan: Once bitten, twice shy, seems to be the guiding principle
behind Kinnevik's decision to create a free sports channel rather than
a pay-channel.

Kinnevik shut down the Filmmax pay-movie channel last autumn because it
could not get enough subscribers.  Subscriptions for its TV1000 film
and entertainment channel have not been good and the channel lost
SKr110 million (#10.7 million) in the first half of 1995.  There have
even been reports of talks between Kinnevik and arch-rival NetHold
about merging TV1000 into NetHold's FilmNet channels.

Kinnevik is not interested in getting its fingers burned again on a pay
channel.  It believes that its free sports channel can outgun NetHold's
pay-channel for three reasons:

* Sports fans in the region are used to watching sport on television
for free

* A free channel will attract more viewers than Supersport and this, in
turn, should enable it to attract more premium events looking for
``eyeballs''

* It will be easier to convince cable networks to take the channel -- an
important consideration in Norway where cable subscribers vote to
decide which channels are offered.

Sportkanalan will need to convince advertisers that a tiny viewing
share is worthwhile.  Managing director Lasse Haglund believes that the
channel can live with a 1-per-cent viewing share.

Veteran sports rights negotiators believe that a low viewing share
could scare off the owners of some events.  According to SVT's Gentzel,
``if you have only a 2-per-cent market share, there will be problems
with the sponsors of sporting events.  There's no point in doing a
channel unless you can get a 5-per-cent share.  SVT's normal share for
sports events is 15 per cent.''

Supersport: NetHold's Supersport is intended to be a must-have for
sports fans, whom the programmer hopes will flock to pay for digital
decoders -- at a cost of SKr6,000 each -- and pay the monthly
subscription fee.

At present, the analogue Supersport costs SKr179 a month if bought as a
stand-alone service or or SKr259 if bought as part of a package with
FilmNet1 and FilmNet 2 (the recently re-named FilmNet Plus and Complete
Movie Channel).

NetHold sees the premium sports channel as a key element in helping to
drive the penetration of its digital package.

With Supersport's raison d'etre dependent on its having more premium
events than Sportkanalan, access to rights is even more crucial.
Supersport's acting deputy head Ian Woodrow said that the channel's
survival will be linked to the number of live events it can show
exclusively.

He said: ``People are used to having sports for free, so we must have
the key sports.  We can't charge premium prices for incidental
sports.''

During the week, Supersport will broadcast six hours of programming in
the evening, expanding to 12 hours a day on weekends. It will have
separate feeds for each of the region's languages, with 70 per cent of
the programming the same for each country.

NetHold intends to run Supersport in parallel with its planned pay-per-
view channels to:

* Maximise revenue of an event by switching, for example, a final match
from Supersport to ppv;

* Increase interest in Supersport by using ppv sports events as a
teaser for the main channel.

Jan Friedman, vice-president of NetHold Nordic, admitted that the
strategy would take a degree of finesse to pull off: ``We don't want to
make loyal Supersport subscribers disappointed.''

Supersport's search for premium events has proven to be less-than-
ideal.  Some critics argue that the line-up (see box) is not worth the
subscription fee.

They point out that the channel does not have exclusive rights for
Swedish ice-hockey and that TV4, from which the rights are sub-
licensed, has a better deal.  Further, Supersport will show only the
Sunday and Monday matches of the English Premier League: rights for the
popular Saturday matches are held by terrestrial broadcasters.

Cable carriage will be another deciding factor.  NetHold is trying to
persuade the main cable operators in the region to sell it capacity to
carry four named channels, but with the freedom to use the capacity for
its full-blown digital service.  So far, none of the major operators
has signed the deal.

It is much easier for Sportkanalan to convince cable networks to take
one channel, rather than the minimum of four being offered by NetHold.

But NetHold's Friedman believes that the company is being generous with
its offer. ``Unless cable operators do a deal with us now, they will
get so many calls from customers wanting to watch Supersport.  In the
first couple of years we do need a parallel cable distribution because
the losses will be very, very high.''

Sportkanalan will broadcast 80 hours of programming a week, and
according to Sternmarker, has already acquired 2,000 hours of
programming.  This includes 500 hours of live golf and 100 hours of
sports documentaries produced by TWI.

Eurosport: The established player in the market, Eurosport Nordic, is
available to the DTH market on the Thor satellite and free on most
cable networks.

Eurosport's Vincent Chupin thinks that the channel can compete with
both new channels when it comes to rights and programming because it is
part of a pan-European network offering advertisers a large audience.

Eurosport, Chupin says, being part-owned by European Broadcasting Union
broadcasters, will be able to draw on a wide variety of sporting events
from across Europe to attract viewers.

Critics, however, argue that the same EBU broadcasters will be tempted
to sell some of the choicest programming to the new sports channels
purely because the money will be better.

They say all these public broadcasters share the same problems: too
much programming and too few slots in the schedule to show it; and
pressure from tight budgets to increase revenues where possible.  Under
these conditions, loyalty to the EBU and Eurosport could take a back
seat to lucrative sub-licensing deals.

Chupin thinks Supersport would do well in Sweden if it showed games
from the Swedish football league.  SVT has the rights for this year and
an option to renew them until 1998.

The key events which neither of the new sports channels have are this
year's Atlanta Olympics and European football championships, which are
both held by SVT and Eurosport.

As for Sportkanalan, Chupin thinks it will at best match Eurosport's
two to three per cent viewing share, something ``I'm not sure if you
can survive merely in Scandinavia.''

ENDEMOL MAY QUIT HMG AS BRUSSELS TURNS UP HEAT

Endemol Entertainment is considering selling its entire stake in the
Holland Media Group in order to safeguard its lucrative programming
contracts with the group's three television channels.

Endemol, the Netherlands largest independent production company, was
told last October by the European Commission that it had to reduce its
stake in the group from 23 per cent to 7.5 per cent.

But last month, the commission went further and said, in informal talks
with HMG, that Endemol should reduce the amount of programming it makes
for HMG's three television channels by at least 10 per cent.  Endemol
was also told that it would not be allowed a seat on the shareholders'
committee, which oversees the board of directors.

Endemol supplies 20 per cent of the output of RTL 4, RTL 5 and
Veronica.  It is likely to sell its HMG stake to one or more of its
partners in the consortium: broadcaster RTL 4, Dutch publishers VNU and
Veronica.

Last October, the commission's competition directorate (DG IV) said
that HMG was anti-competitive as it stood.  To satisfy Brussels, HMG
partner RTL 4 is selling 66 per cent of its satellite channel RTL 5.

ADULT CHANNEL SEEKS GERMAN RESPECTABILITY

The Adult Channel, already available to direct-to-home satellite
viewers in Germany, has applied to German media regulators for approval
to go on German cable networks.

The encrypted channel, which is licensed for satellite transmission in
Europe by the UK's Independent Television Commission, has asked for a
certificate of ``confirmation of non-objection'' from the DLM, the
umbrella body of the country's 15 media regulators.

This means that the DLM must monitor the channel's programming to see
whether it can be deemed to be pornography.  If the regulators decide
that it is pornographic, the channel can be refused permission to go on
cable under German media law.

Regulators say this is the first time they have had such a request.
There are no ``adult'' channels on German cable networks at present.

When the German pay-channel Premiere introduced an adult segment two
years ago, the DLM commissioned an expert from the University of
Hamburg to judge whether the programming was pornographic.

He judged it on sociological grounds, deciding that it was pornographic
because it had no plot and women had no role or character other than to
satisfy men, the typical role of women in pornography.  As a result,
the programming was withdrawn.

The DLM should come to a decision on the Adult Channel within six
months and may well commission an expert in a similar way.

LIVE TV HOPES FOR BOOST FROM DARTS, SOAP AND ADS

Live TV, the Mirror Group's cable channel, admitted this week that its
controversial screening of ``topless darts'', which started on Monday,
had been criticised by professional women's darts players.

The darts contests, filmed on Australian beaches, run for two minutes
each night at 11pm.  Live TV denied that the contestants -- women of a
certain age and shape -- had been chosen on the basis of their looks
rather than their ability to project darts at a board.  The programming
was neither sexist nor exploitative, said Live TV, but ``good clean
fun.''

The darts programmes will be followed next Monday by the debut of the
channel's soap opera, Canary Wharf, which is equally sexual in content,
featuring bed-hopping among television executives of a range of sexual
orientations.  Publicity for the programme promises that ``you're never
more than five minutes from a snog.''

The new programming is being backed by a #1 million radio and poster
advertising campaign which the channel claims is the biggest by a UK
cable-only channel.  The campaign uses the slogan ``Look on the bright
side'' -- something which the Mirror Group hopes to do if the new
programming boosts the poor ratings of the channel in which it is
investing #30 million.

PERFORMANCE TO EXPAND

Performance, the cable arts channel owned by Associated Newspapers, is
to move to satellite distribution in March via the Orion 1 satellite.

The channel, at present tape-delivered, will increase its transmission
hours and will seek to gain an audience on cable networks in
Scandinavia and the Benelux countries.

It will also introduce strip-scheduling, broadcasting jazz programming
at the same time each day during weekdays and opera at weekends.
Audience feedback for the channel, which is aimed at an upmarket
audience, suggested that jazz and opera were its most popular
offerings.

BRUNO AND MAN UTD TOP YEAR'S NEW-MEDIA CHARTS

Cable and satellite's most popular programme of 1995 -- and most popular
ever -- was Frank Bruno's successful challenge for the WBC World
Heavyweight Championship against Oliver McCall in September.

The programme attracted 2,248,000 viewers, giving it a TVR (percentage
of those people who could watch it) of 17.3 and a viewing share of 42.7
per cent in Astra dish and cable homes.

The charts have been compiled by New Media Markets as part of an
analysis of viewing data from Barb (Broadcasters Audience Research
Board).

The second most popular programme was one of last season's key Premier
League matches -- Manchester United v Blackburn Rovers, with 2,036,000
viewers (TVR 16.8 and viewing share 41.7 per cent).

Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg's dinosaur epic, came in at Number 3,
attracting 2,007,000 viewers for the Movie Channel.

The film was the only programme to break Sky Sports monopoly of the Top
10.  Only one other non-sports programme -- the film, Demolition Man, in
14th place -- made the Top 20.  Sports programmes took 26 of the Top 30
Astra programmes and 35 of the Top 50 programmes, with the premium film
channels and Sky One performing respectably in the 40s.

If Frank Bruno was new-media's biggest one-night stand, Manchester
United was its most consistent star.  Five top soccer matches took the
fourth-to-eighth positions, with Manchester United playing in all but
one of the games, as well as taking the No.2 spot.

The third most popular film of the year, after Jurassic Park and
Demolition Man, was The Fugitive, followed by Mrs Doubtfire and Jungle
Book.  Jungle Book, which launched the Disney Channel on October 1, was
the most popular non-BSkyB Astra programme, with 1,303,000 viewers.  It
was the only non-BSkyB programme to get more than a million viewers and
the only one to make the overall Astra Top 50 chart.

Disney also took the second and third places of the non-BSkyB chart,
both with screenings of the film, Cool Runnings.  But the chart was
dominated by the Cartoon Network, with 32 of the Top 50 programmes.

Sky One was the most popular channel over the year as a whole, with a
viewing share of 5 per cent, according to the New Media Markets
analysis.  The share was hit by a poor winter (only 4 per cent in
December).  Sky One's 1994 share was 5.4 per cent.

Sky Sports achieved 3.8 per cent for the year, 0.3 points up on 1994.
It had a good December, with 5 per cent, and a very good Christmas week
at 7.1 per cent, equalling its second-best weekly share.

MURDOCH CONSORTIUM BIDS #1.2BN FOR EUROPEAN TV RIGHTS TO OLYMPICS

A consortium backed by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the leading
shareholder in British Sky Broadcasting, submitted a bid worth more
than $2 billion (#1.2 billion) for the European broadcasting rights for
the winter and summer Olympics between 2000 and 2008.  Olympic rights
have normally gone to the European Broadcasting Union, which negotiates
collectively on behalf of Europe's public-service broadcasters.

The consortium, which is thought to include other continental
broadcasters, would show the Olympics on terrestrial and subscription
networks.

MAJOR CONSIDERS BSKYB SPORTS BAN

UK Prime Minister John Major said that the government is considering
the imposition of restrictions on British Sky Broadcasting's right to
buy television sports rights.  National Heritage secretary Virginia
Bottomley said before Christmas that any restriction was ``out of the
question''.  The Office of Fair Trading is already investigating
BSkyB's purchase of exclusive sports rights.

BBC PROTESTS AFTER ARABIC BLACK-OUT

The BBC's Arabic television service was repeatedly blacked out during
its coverage of the UK government's decision last week to deport
Mohammed al-Mas'ari, the Saudi dissident.  The service is shown as part
of an Orbit Communications package of channels distributed from Orbit's
relay station in Rome, where the black-out occurred.  Orbit is owned by
a cousin of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Prince Khalid bin 'Abd al-
Rahman.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government failed in its bid to get Channel 4 to
drop its Tuesday night transmission of a documentary about Chinese
orphanage ``dying rooms''.

BERTELSMANN MAY BID FOR CLT

Bertelsmann of Germany, partnered by Canal Plus and Havas of France,
could bid more than $2 billion (#1.3 billion) for control of Compagnie
Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion.  Group Bruxelles Lambert, which owns
nearly 60 per cent of CLT, wants to sell and has talked to a number of
companies.  British Sky Broadcasting is thought to be a potential
bidder, in league with Germany's Kirch Group.

FOOD GROUP TAKES A BITE OF PRO-7

Rewe, Germany's biggest food retailer, acquired 40 per cent of the
Kirch-backed Pro 7 general entertainment cable channel.

Rewe is believed to have paid DM120 million (#53.8 million) for the
stake, a sum described by one German media regulator as ``ridiculously
low'', in view of the channel's net profit last year of about DM200
million.

Pro 7 is selling a further 35.5 per cent on the stock market, in an
attempt to deflect criticism of Thomas Kirch, who was thought by many
regulators to hold his stake of 47.5 per cent in the channel on behalf
of his father Leo Kirch, founder of the Kirch Group.

PEARSON CLOSE TO BUYING SELECTV

Pearson TV said that it has completed due diligence on the purchase of
SelecTV.  But Flextech refuses to rule itself out as a potential
purchaser.

Pearson's purchase is being delayed because it says it is not
interested in buying SelecTV's cable channel or its 15-per-cent stake
in ITV company Meridian which will have to be sold separately.

The prospective purchasers are thought to be ITV franchise holder
Carlton, for the cable channel, and MAI, for the Meridian stake (MAI is
Meridian's main shareholder).

IBM ATTEMPTING TO SECURE CYBERSPACE FOR DEVELOPERS

       IBM Corp. is working to help protect copyright and licensing
rights of content developers heading for cyberspace. 
       To do that, IBM this spring plans to launch its cryptolope
technology which will protect copyrighted content from being pilfered
by cybersurfers who have not paid for the content.
       The issue is a huge concern for developers, who want to protect
their copyrighted material and ensure that they are compensated when
their content is downloaded from the Net.
       The technology will be available for use through IBM's new
Internet information service, infoMarket, which will provide
comprehensive financial and industry-specific information.
       "Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for buyers and
sellers to get together" in a secure environment, IBM spokesperson
Matthew Van Ryn told New Media Week.  "Right now...there's nothing to
prevent someone from dropping [copyrighted material] in e-mail and
sending it to 1,000 of their closest friends."
       Ultimately, the technology will give developers control over the
pricing and rights to a piece of copyrighted information.
       IBM plans to take 10 to 20 percent "or whatever it's going to
be," of what the content provider charges the user, said Van Ryn. That
percentage will be fixed and the company has no plans to charge
subscription or online fees.
       Industry analysts believe that the technology may even help to
encourage the proliferation of online content developers who have,
thus far, been weary of unauthorized mass-distribution of their work
over the Internet.
       In theory, online developers have instant access to consumers at
little or no transaction costs.  
       "The difficulty is that [their content] has been freely
forwardable to everybody else," said Dean Gloster, a partner in the
Multimedia group of San Francisco law firm Farella, Braun & Martel.
"Copyright infringement is a hobby on the Internet," he added.
Reaping Benefits
       It's not only IBM that stands to profit from the new technology.
             Developers will benefit in two ways:  they will not have
to convert their databases for online use, and they will have control
over how the content looks and how much subscribers pay for it, said
Van Ryn.
       The technology holds so much promise for increased security, not
to mention greater contact with customers, that such content providers
as American Business Information Inc. (ABI) have already signd on as
one of IBM's pre-eminent content providers.
       ABI provides Yellow Pages information for every U.S. community.
       IBM measured up to ABI's criteria for choosing an online vehicle
for its content.
       "What we do is look at the firewalls that [an Internet service]
can demonstrate to us," said Bill Kerrey, ABI's senior vice president
of business development.

CAMBRIX, TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX CROSS-PROMOTE AVIATION PRODUCTS

       Piggybacking on the marketing strength of major film studios,
new media companies like Cambrix Publishing are discovering that
cross-promoting their titles with hit movies is a sure-fire way to
boost unit sales.
       Last week, the company launched a marketing campaign with
Twentieth Century Fox to promote Cambrix's Wild Blue Yonder aviation
CD-ROM set and Fox's Broken Arrow feature film about futuristic B-3
bomber pilots.  
       Integral to the strategy is a rebate offer that aviation fans
may find hard to resist.  With any purchase of the CD-ROM set between
January 1 and April 15, Cambrix will rebate the full price of a movie
ticket (up to $7.50) to see Fox's Broken Arrow.
       "We [plan] to use the resources of the studios whenever
possible," said Cambrix Vice President Richard Hart.  
       One of the best ways to promote a title is tie it or complement
a movie.  "Then you piggyback on someone else's promotion," and
benefit from the association, said Hart.
       "The [airplane] technology you see in Broken Arrow...is very
integral to the [movie's] plot," he said.  "Because of that...people
will want to know more about what these fighters are all about."
       Hence, Cambrix's CD-ROMs that detail the history of aviation and
the technology "deepens people's appreciation for the movie," said
Hart.

Traditional Vs. Non-traditional

       Lauded as the first time a film studio and CD-ROM publisher have
cross-promoted somewhat unrelated products, the strategy is a mix of
traditional and non-traditional marketing strategies.
       The rebate offer requires the consumer to mail the CD-ROM
receipt and movie ticket stub into Cambrix for full refund on the cost
of the movie.
       With a suggested retail price of $19.99, Cambrix claims this is
one of the most significant rebate offers undertaken to date.  But
it's not the only movie rebate offer ever undertaken.
       Walt Disney last year recruited the 2,600 movie theaters
planning to show its animated film Toy Story to offer movie-goers a $5
Toy Story videogame rebate coupon at ticket windows.  Consumers had to
then bring their ticket stub to Toys "R" Us for their discount.

Marketing Beyond Rebates

       In addition to the rebate offer, Fox provided Cambrix access to
the movie, printed materials, movie posters that include the CD-ROM
advertisement and several pages within its Web site devoted to the
Wild Blue Yonder/Broken Arrow promotion. (The site will launch today
at www.brokenarrow.com.)  Fox also will further promote the Web site
heavily in print, poster and television advertising of the film.
       Within the site is an factual area on today's B-2 bombers and
related material of Cambrix's title.  "There's very nice synergy...and
also some real "meat" to the site itself," said Hart.  Users can pull
up aviation information as well as download clips from the site.  
       In return, Fox generates interest within the computer
marketplace.  "And because of the demographics and the technical base
of the movie...it ties in nicely," said Hart.  "For Fox, they reach a
market they didn't have access to."
       What's particularly unique about this campaign is that the
products are not directly related to one another.  They do, however,
share a common theme: Broken Arrow stars John Travolta and Christian
Slater as stealth bomber pilots engaged in an unimaginable conflict;
Wild Blue Yonder is a two CD-ROM disc interactive exploration of the
triumphs and tragedies of aviation.
       Finally, the marketing strategy also will include a sweepstakes
offering prizes including a trip for two to Hollywood and a visit to
Twentieth Century Fox lot.
       Fans can enter via the Broken Arrow Web site or through America
Online's Cinema POV Area, which also is highlighting the promotion and
enabling cybersurfers to enter the contest.

Exception or the Norm

       Several multimedia developers told New Media Week this size
marketing blitz is becoming more than norm than the exception.
       "If you look at the amount of money being put into developing
[titles], it's no wonder the cost of marketing them is going up,"
added Ken Christie, vice president of marketing for the Interactive
Multimedia Association.  "They have to get some kind of a return on
their investment."
       Cambrix, however, seems to be getting the best of both worlds: 
it's successfully sells its product to movie-goers on a national basis
while only chipping in $100,000 of its own marketing dollars.  
       And compared to Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Walt Disney
and Acclaim Entertainment's multi-million dollar marketing campaigns,
Cambridge's budget is just a drop in the bucket.

Security on the Horizon

IBM's upcoming cryptolope technology promises to offer security to
content developers considering online distribution of their material.
       Here's how it works: users who want to purchase any content
offered through IBM's infoMarket Service will receive the material in
a sealed cryptolope container (short for "encrypted envelope") along
with a key to unlock the package.
       Users can purchase whole or partial material. After the content
is downloaded, printed or read, the cryptolope reseals to prevent
subsequent copying or transmitting of the material, thereby ensuring
that the user pays for it each time.

EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TARGET SCHOOLS TO HELP BOOST SAGGING
RETAIL SALES

       With the top selling educational software titles scoring a
fraction of the sales of their entertainment counterparts, educational
software publishers must also begin tapping the school market to
generate additional revenue.
       Although Pixel Genius Entertainment's first title Pocahontas was
successful in the retail market-it ranked among educational top
sellers at 5,000 copies per month for its first five months-the
company has discovered that it can boost its profits by selling to
educational institutions.
       "There's a much more limited market segment for educational
titles [than entertainment titles], and this is no exception," said
Paul Janavs, co-president of Pixel. "Entertainment products are aimed
at a much larger target market. But the [education] market is growing
very rapidly and it still has a whole other side of distribution,
which is the school market."
       Pixel is banking on increasing its profits by 75 percent by
jumping into this virtually untapped market. 
       On Feb. 1 it will introduce the teacher's version of Pocahontas,
a reading-oriented title. Unlike the retail version, this one will be
packed with cross-curriculum activities, touching not only on language
arts, but on math and science as well.  
       The company declined to disclose sales figures or projections on
the upcoming version.

A Retail Supplement

Jack Bocock, marketing director of Boxer Inc., another educational
software developer, agrees that the industry can count on schools for
heavy sales.  His company targets only that segment of the market.  
       "Real education titles are natural for a school environment,"
Bocock said.  "The [retail] channel is a tough channel for all of us. 
There are few who make money in that channel, even entertainment
software.  For real educational titles, [the retail market] is not
feasible."
       But some industry analysts disagree.  Peter Rogers, an analyst
with Bear Stearns & Co. , said focusing solely on the school market is
rare.  
       Targeting consumers first has worked best for such major
educational software companies as The Learning Co. , Davidson &
Associates and Broderbund .
       "Sometimes they've supplemented their efforts by going  directly
to schools, but it's consumers that drive the business," he said.

Tackling Distribution

       Pixel, however, is not deterred.  To reach the education market,
the company first found a target market less crowded with competitors. 
             Pocahontas is one of the few educational titles that
targets an older age group, Janavs said. It's aimed at 5- to
10-year-olds instead of 3- to 6-year-olds, like most reading titles.
       On the distribution front, the company is signing up with
special wholesalers who distribute exclusively to education buyers.  
       Pixel also has contacted mail-order catalogs that cater to
teachers. 
       The company is even tailoring its packaging for the education
market by offering the teacher's version in bulk packs of 30 and
additional 5-pack for student computer laboratories.  
       By focusing its marketing strategy on this niche, Pixel is
betting it can earn profits totaling three-quarters of what it earns
in its retail market.  

Differentiating Itself 

       With competition fierce, Pixel implemented several strategies to
ensure the success of its Pocahontas school edition.
       Unique to this Pocahontas version are activities designed for
the Internet.  
       "We haven't seen [internet activities on educational software]
done, but we know schools are very excited about the Internet," said
Pixel's Janavs.
       "We're trying to provide [educators] with Internet activities
related to the Pocahontas story book so students will learn to use the
internet as a research tool by gathering information about the history
of Pocahontas."
       The teacher's version also includes a teacher's manual that
provides tear-out pages for worksheets and extension activities for
students.  

Future Plans

       Pixel also is taking great care with the versions of products it
hopes to distribute to nationwide classrooms.             
       Most importantly, the company learned from educators that
building a child's confidence in the title is more effective than
speaking down to them. "You don't need to oversimplify things for
children," he said.
       Upcoming company plans include expanding its Reading Success for
Kids series with Jack and the Beanstalk, due out this month, and an
Aladdin title, which will hit store shelves March 1.

NEW MEDIA NEWS IN BRIEF

Competition Heating Up
     U.S.-based multimedia developers soon will face even more
competition in light of the growing trend of distributing foreign
multimedia titles in the United States. 
     Case in point:  National distributor Navarre Corp.'s Digital
Entertainment subsidiary has entered into an exclusive U.S.
distribution agreement with OmniMedia, the U.K.'s first dedicated
multimedia producer and publisher.
     Digital Entertainment will begin distributing OmniMedia's CD-ROM
catalogue in late April, featuring such titles as The Ultimate Video
JukeBox: Volume 1 and The Greatest Toy Shop on Earth.
     Founded in 1993, London-based OmniMedia owns a best-selling
catalog with 12 titles, movies, general interest titles and children's
CD-ROM titles.  
     Digital Entertainment develops, licenses, publishes and
distributes interactive CD titles focusing on music and entertainment. 
It also merchandises, markets and distributes computer software titles
to traditional and non-traditional retail outlets.  (Tech Solutions
for Navarre, 212/696-2000)

Pulitzer Embraces the Web
     Signaling that big industry multimedia developers still believe
the Internet is a good place to leverage their content, Pulitzer
Publishing Co. has introduced the information service POSTnet to the
Web.
     POSTnet--the interactive supplement to the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch--includes news, sports, entertainment, directories,
community forums, chats and other material. Pulitzer also will be an
Internet access provider for people in the St. Louis metropolitan
area.
     Large segments of POSTnet content are available at no charge to
all Internet users, while use of full newswires, Post-Dispatch
archives, and POSTnet newsgroups are limited to POSTnet subscribers.
(Connie Hoffman, 314/865-8500).


Interactive Marketing Grows
     Multimedia developers aspiring to market their services
interactively take note: Interactive Media Works and Phoneworks have
teamed to form Phonivation, a new venture dedicated to developing and
managing interactive programs for major interactive marketing
campaigns.
     The alliance will market such proprietary products and services
as IMW's SampleNET CARD and Phoneworks' Electronic Green Stamps. 
     St. Petersburg-based Phoneworks specializes in using interactive
technologies for advertising, marketing and promotions, and works with
packaged goods, entertainment, cable, broadcast and Madison Avenue
companies to design marketing and implementation plans.
     Overland, Kansas-based Interactive Media Works specializes in
direct response and strategic marketing applications of interactive
media and other new technologies.  (Interactive Media Works
913/385-0055)

Crowded  Arena Developing
     Edutainment developers step aside for new competition.  Harber
Brother Productions has launched its new KinderActive children's
CD-ROM publishing arm.  In so doing, the company will produce and
market CD-ROMs and enhanced CDs that combine children's music,
characters and stories with digital graphics. 
     Leading the charge will be Nicole Silver, director of production. 
Silver is a producer at Lancit Media, a leading children's television
production firm that produces Puzzle Place, Reading Rainbow and
Backyard Safari.   
     Under the KinderActive line will be the KinderActive Musicals and
KinderActive Minds labels.  KinderActive Musicals is a new genre of
entertainment products for kids age three to eight that feature songs,
characters and stories on CD-ROM and enhanced CD formats.  (Tech
Solutions for Harber Bros., 212/696-2000)

Airview Appoints Maners VP
     The Network Connection Inc. last week named a new vice president
of marketing for its in-flight entertainment product called Airview. 
Del Maners, formerly vice president of sales for Burnes
Aerospace-West, joins TNCI's Aerospace division in that capacity.      
     Airview is among the first to deliver full-motion entertainment
screens mounted in seatbacks on passenger planes.  
     The Airview entertainment system consists of in-flight on-demand
movies, music videos, interactive computer games, destination travel
videos, city entertainment videos, faxing and Internet access for Web
site viewing.  (The Network Connection, 800/327-4853)

NBC Snags Boles 
     NBC Super Channel named Nicholas Boles head of new media,
responsible for the introduction of new revenue generating activities
in the areas of data broadcasting, interactive services, online
services, multimedia and specialized business broadcasting.
     Boles joins NBC from the consultant firm Media Strategy
Innovation.  Prior to Media Strategy, he held senior management
positions with EMI Music, Strategy Research Associates, Mirror Group
Television, British Satellite Broadcasting and BBC Subscription
Television.  (NBC Super Channel, 44 181 600 6600)

In Development: 
The "pornography police" will have a field day when they stumble upon
racks of "erotic" multimedia products displayed in plain view.
     Mature Multimedia, which is creating a merchandising program
aimed at snatching up prime retail real estate for its erotic
products, is planning to do just that.
     Wow!, the 60,000-square-foot multimedia superstore co-owned by
Tower Records and The Good Guys!, will be Mature Multimedia's partner
in crime, serving as the initial site for the pilot that will test
consumer acceptance of the program.
     Ten publishers of PG-13, NC-17 and R-Rated CD-ROM jewel-cased
titles will be involved in the market research study that combines a
low-tech retail merchandising display rack with high-tech multimedia
and the Internet.
     But those concerned about "negatively influencing" their
loved-ones' minds, beware.
     The CD-ROM sampler will use a 3D graphical interactive television
interface that will enable CD-ROM browsers to preview the products
sold.  (A Web address also (www.intermaginary.com) provides links to
all participating publishers' Web sites in the program.) 
     Until now, Mature Multimedia products have been classified and
displayed with graphic XXX adult products.  As a result, sales of
"softer erotic content" have suffered, said the company.  
     Hence, the pilot program opens a new channel to retail so
consumers can browse through the "in-between titles"-  those that may
not be suitable for young, hardcore gamers, but don't classify as
X-rated material.  

***
     Although maintaining a less-than-admirable track record as a
conduit for gameplay, at least three more multimedia industry giants
are betting that the Internet will, no doubt, be a great place for
synchronized PC gaming.
     The Total Entertainment Network, Catapult Entertainment and Mpath
Interactive are preparing Web-based services designed to enable
multiple players to battle it out over the Internet.
     But what about the never-ending complaints that the Internet is
simply too slow and unresponsive to attract hardcore gamers?  
"No problem," say each of the developers.   
     Overcoming this problem (believed to exist because of so much
incompatible software processing PC commands at different speeds) can
be overcome by writing their own proprietary software for synchronized
game play over the network.  Or so they say.
     

***
     It's kind of scary when chess software can beat the game's
leading human grandmasters--everytime. 
     Notably, in the Fifth Harvard Cup Human Versus Computer Intel
Chess Challenge, eight of the top chess programs on the market took on
six of the leading human grandmasters, and at the end of the contest,
WChess beat them all.
     Sierra On-Line, which has inked a deal to produce and sell the
software, will launch it in the form of a game called PowerChes in
November on CD-ROM for Windows 95.
     WChess A1, the engine behind the software, is the result of more
than ten years of development work by the programming team of
Intelligent Heuristic Programming Inc. (Sierra On-Line, Michael
Brochu, 206/649-9800)

***
     Targeting the choosy, hard-to-please or compulsive consumer,
Integrated Communications and Entertainment Inc. (ICE) is teaming with
WAVE Interactive Network (WIN) to allow consumers to taste-test
content before plunking down the big bucks.
     Mirroring furniture depots and office hardware suppliers across
the country, consumers will be able to buy diverse CD-ROMs on a
pay-per-use basis, rent-to-own, try-before-you-buy or by an outright
purchase through the new venture.
     In addition, consumers will be able to purchase or rent this
content via CD-ROMs, data broadcast, cable connections and through the
Net.  
     How?  WIN consumers will receive an enormous bundle of enabling
PC hardware, the WaveMeter, the WIN merchandising engine and 20 to 30
CD-ROM titles.

LETTER FROM THE EDITOR


Dear NewsNet Subscribers:

It seems only fitting that the first Action Letter of the 1990s be a
special issue--and we think it's a very special one indeed.

In less than a month, an all-new version of NewsFlash will be
released.  This issue of the Action Letter is dedicated to these
important enhancements: what does the new NewsFlash mean to you? How
does it work? Why was it designed?  This issue of the Action Letter
was written to help you understand the new NewsFlash, and to put it
to the most effective possible use.  Keep this issue as a reference
tool.

The new NewsFlash has been several years in the making, and was
officially unveiled at the Online '89 trade show, held in Chicago
this past November. The reactions from subscribers who came to the
NewsFlash sneak preview at the Online show were overwhelmingly
positive--and we hope yours will be, too.

The entire NewsNet staff has a had a hand in this project, and we've
worked long and hard to satisfy even the most demanding information
needs. Special thanks must be extended to the following members of
the Software Development team--Adrienne Adler, Lisa Byrne, George
Pickul, Edward Reese, Gary Rosenzweig, Tom Scott, Michael Stein; to
Andrew Elston, NewsNet's Executive Vice President, a wonderful
perfectionist whose quest for the ideal product has brought us (we
hope) pretty close; and to all of NewsNet for their testing help.

We'd also like to thank our beta testers, a dedicated and patient
group who never balked when we extended the test "just one more
week!" Thanks for all your comments and feedback. We couldn't have
done it without you.

And, last but certainly not least, we'd like to thank you, our
subscribers, for your suggestions and input. The design of the new
NewsFlash was based largely on ideas we've received from many of you
over the past several years. Thanks for your support and all your
ideas. We appreciate them all.

Let us know what you think of the new NewsFlash. We're starting work
now on the next phase--even more enhancements to the new NewsFlash!


Sincerely,


Patricia A. McParland
Action Letter Editor

NEWSFLASH: A NEW CLIPPING SERVICE FOR A NEW DECADE

It's official--the new version of NewsFlash is completed and
tested, and we're just about ready to release it.

Starting at the end of January, we will be releasing NewsFlash to
a group of NewsNet subscribers each week. All subscribers will be
converted to the new version by April.

The new NewsFlash incorporates features that you've requested for
years, including the ability to monitor virtually unlimited numbers
of phrases, use of complete Boolean logic to construct your keyword
phrases, and many, many other enhancements. See "Enhanced
NewsFlash... What It Means to You" in this issue for a rundown of
what the new version of NewsFlash has to offer.

Why the Rewrite?

NewsFlash, first released more than six years ago, has been one
of the information industry's premier electronic clipping services
(or, as they are also called, SDI or selective dissemination of
information services).

NewsFlash allowed NewsNet users to monitor up to 10 keyword phrases
for topics of interest to them, 24 hours a day. Any time information
matching the interests of a NewsFlash user was received at NewsNet,
that information would be posted to the subscriber's NewsNet account.

NewsFlash was an instant hit, and quickly became one of the most
popular features used by NewsNet subscribers. With NewsFlash, there
was no need for interactive searching--NewsFlash would monitor all
NewsNet services for your specified keyword phrases, and deliver the
results to you automatically.

Room to Improve

NewsFlash sounds like an almost ideal clipping service, and
in some ways, it was. As with just about anything else, however, there
was room for improvement, and frequent users of NewsFlash began giving
us suggestions on how to enhance the product.

We listened, and in 1987, we began actively soliciting feedback on
how we could best improve NewsFlash. What, specifically, did users
want?  We conducted several extensive telephone surveys, and found
that several suggestions were mentioned especially often:

    1.  The ability to monitor more than 10 phrases.

For anyone seriously involved in competitive intelligence, an
important application of NewsFlash, 10 phrases just isn't enough, our
subscribers told us. In fact, several of the subscribers we spoke
with had more than one NewsNet ID number in order to have more than
10 NewsFlash phrases.

    2.  Keyword phrases should support the use of full searching
        logic.

NewsFlash offered only one logical connector--the + sign, used to
indicate AND. Users wanted to be able to use such connectors as OR
and BUT NOT in their phrases, and to use options allowed in
searching, such as parentheses, string searching, and proximity
searching.

    3.  Users should be able to decide when articles found by
        NewsFlash are delivered.

NewsFlash automatically delivered matching articles (called "hits")
to the user's NewsNet account, and they were displayed automatically
upon signon. There was no way to bypass this notification--you had to
either read, save, or delete your NewsFlash hits before you could
enter the NewsNet database.

We took all of these concerns--and many others mentioned to us by
subscribers over the years--and began design work on a product that
would address them.

Many ideas and work hours later, at the end of last summer, a
vestigial version of the new NewsFlash was ready for testing.  We
rounded up several important industry figures--writers, researchers,
and publishers, to name a few--to help us beat up the new product.
The test period continued through the fall as we isolated and fixed
wrinkles and flaws in the new NewsFlash, aided by the expert
suggestions and opinions of our outside testers.

In early November, the new NewsFlash was officially unveiled for the
first time at the Online '89 conference in Chicago. NewsNet users and
non-subscribers alike attended the special NewsFlash sneak preview,
and the reactions were all we could have hoped for, and then some.
"This is great," one subscriber said. "I've been using five NewsNet
accounts just so I could have more phrases, and now I won't have to.
" Others were especially impressed by the complexity of the phrases
now allowed--up to 256 characters, including the use of full Boolean
logic--and by the fact that hits are delivered only when you want
them.

In This Issue

This issue of the Action Letter is dedicated to the NewsFlash
enhancements, and is designed to help you get acclimated quickly to
the new product.

"Applications of NewsFlash" covers uses for NewsFlash.  "Creating
Folders and Phrases" outlines the rudiments of setting up your
NewsFlash profile, while "Reading Your Hits: A Primer" shows you the
basics of hit retrieval. Keep this issue as you learn to use the new
NewsFlash, and refer to it.  And access the electronic clipping
service of the future--today.

APPLICATIONS OF THE NEW NEWSFLASH


If you've never used NewsFlash before--or if you've used it, but not
often--you may not be aware of the power and flexibility this
electronic clipping utility offers you.

Uses for NewsFlash are as varied as the people who use it--from fast-
food executives to the research department at National Public Radio.
Whether you need industry news or general news, if it's on NewsNet,
NewsFlash can find it for you.

Use NewsFlash to monitor:

    o  Your competition. What are others in your industry up to?
       Is your fiercest rival up for takeover? Will their new
       product offering eclipse yours?

    o  Your own company. What does the press have to say about
       your organization? Are you the subject of corporate
       rumors? Find out now--before it may be too late.

    o  Your trademarks. Is your company name--or the name of one
       of your products--registered? Keep tabs on it to make sure
       no one's making unlawful use of what's rightfully yours.

    o  Your clients. Do you work in a law firm? In public
       relations? Are you a consultant or an editor? For current,
       breaking background information, there's no better source
       than NewsFlash.

    o  Your industry. Track trends, mergers and acquisitions, new
       products and technologies--whatever you need to know.
       Don't search for it. Let NewsFlash search for you.

    o  Your priorities. If it's important to you, let NewsFlash
       track it for you, whether it's your town, your team, your
       alma mater, or your political party.

Need help constructing your NewsFlash keyword phrases? Call our
Customer Service representatives today at 800-345-1301. They'll be
happy to help you design a profile that best suits your needs.

GLOSSARY OF NEWSFLASH TERMS

The following list outlines terminology used in the new NewsFlash.
Keep this list as a guide, and refer to it as you learn to make the
most of the NewsFlash enhancements.

?
Delivers a list of commands valid at that prompt and a brief help
message.

database range
Portion of the database being monitored by a keyword phrase. Database
range may consist of an individual service code, an industry code,
any combination of service and industry codes, or the entire database
(ALL), up to 256 characters.

default
With keyword phrase, folder, or global options, the default is the
standard setting. For the folder option "Display unviewed hits at
signon?," for example, the default setting is YES. If the user does
not choose to modify an option, the default setting will be used.


FLASH
Command used to enter NewsFlash mode, where folders can be created,
deleted, or listed, or options adjusted. The command NewsFlash can
also be used. (Neither command is case-sensitive.)

folder maintenance
Blanket term used to describe the process of establishing and
maintaining folders of keyword phrases. Also called NewsFlash set-up.

folder options
Set of specifications that allows the user to decide how individual
folders--collections of keyword phrases grouped by the user according
to subject matter--will be constructed. Folder options that can be
adjusted by the user include the foldername, the activity status and
activation date, the expiration date, hit sorting requirements, and
hit delivery method for this folder. The user can later any or all of
these options for a particular folder. If no specific options are
requested, the system will default to a standard set of
specifications.

foldername
The name, chosen by the user, that designates the contents of a
specific folder. The foldername can be set or altered at the folder
option level. Foldernames must consist of at least one, but not more
than 44 characters.

global options
Set of specifications that allows the user to decide how NewsFlash hits
will be sorted and delivered in all of a user's folders.  Global options
that can be adjusted by the user include when new hits will be
displayed, when saved hits should be presented, whether hits should be
saved or deleted after viewing, and whether or not the user should be
instantly informed of new hits that arrive during a NewsNet session.
The user may alter any or all of the available options, and may choose
to alter them permanently or only for the current session. If no
specific options are requested, the system will default to a standard
set of specifications.

hit
Term used to describe an individual article found, or "clipped", by
NewsFlash.

instant notification flag
A global option that notifies the user instantly of new NewsFlash
hits. Operative only while the user is actually signed on to
the NewsNet system.

keyword phrase
Word, phrase, or combination of words and phrase the user is monitoring
with NewsFlash. Each entry in a NewsFlash profile is termed a keyword
phrase. If a user were monitoring the entire database for mentions of
Iraq within sixteen words or Iraq, for example, the keyword phrase would
be IRAN W/16 IRAQ. Keyword phrases may consist of up to
256 characters.

line count
Part of both the brief and long headline displays. Shows the number of
lines contained in a particular item clipped by NewsFlash.

NewsFlash
1) NewsNet's SDI (selective dissemination of information) service, also
   called an electronic clipping service. Allows the user to monitor a
   particular service, any combination of services, or the entire
   database for specific terms, called keyword phrases, of interest.
   Monitors the specified service or services (called the database
   range) continously, even while the user is offline.
2) The command used to enter NewsFlash. While equivalent to the
   command FLASH, FLASH is preferable since it is easier
   to remember and shorter to enter.

profile
Same as folder. A collection of keyword phrases grouped together by the
user. A folder or profile may contain as few as one keyword phrase, or
as many as the user desires.

QuickFlash
A NewsFlash command that allows the user to set up folders and keyword
phrase without specifying option (default, or standard, option will be
set automatically). Designed for the new user, the user who wants to use
NewsFlash with a minimum of effort, or the user who is happy
with the current version of NewsFlash.

<RETURN>
A carriage return; also called Enter on some equipment.  Used to send a
line of input to NewsNet. Used by itself on a line in NewsFlash,
<RETURN> moves the user back one prompt at a time, unless it has some
special function at that prompt (if so, it will be mentioned in the
prompt, e.g. /<RETURN>/ for YES).

saved hits
Hits that the user has already seen, but that have been saved for future
retrieval. The user may choose, by altering the global option settings,
when to display saved hits--before new hits, after new hits, or by
request only.

word count
Displayed as part of both brief and long hit displays. Shows the number
of words contained in an individual article clipped by NewsFlash.

READING YOUR NEWSFLASH HITS: A PRIMER


The articles that NewsFlash finds for you--your "hits"--will be
displayed when you sign on, when you sign off, or only when you
request them, according to your global option settings.  Global
options govern how your hits will be organized and delivered
throughout the hit display system.  Use the OPTIONS command in
FLASH to adjust your global option settings.

If you have not changed your global option settings, hits will be
displayed when you sign on.

Regardless of when your NewsFlash hits are actually displayed, you
will receive a brief notification message each time you sign on to the
NewsNet system. This message, which displays the number of saved and
unviewed hits you have waiting, looks like this:

NEWSFLASH NOTIFICATION
======================

Folder FOLDER0001
10 unviewed hits, 12 saved hits


If you have no unviewed or saved hits, a message to this effect
will be displayed.


Reading Your Hits

If your hits are displayed upon signon, as they will be if you
have not adjusted your global options settings, you will be taken
directly into the NewsFlash hit display system immediately after the
NewsFlash notification message is displayed.

If you have more than one folder of keyword phrases, the first prompt
in hit display asks you to enter a foldername.  This prompt looks like
this:

Enter foldername, ALL, LIST (folders), or RENOTIFY
 -->

After you enter a foldername (or immediately after you enter hit
display, if you have only one folder), the main hit display prompt
will be displayed.  This prompt looks like this:

Enter HEAd for headlines; TExt; SOrt, SUmmary, ANALYZE; or Retrieve
(saved or deleted hits)
 -->


At this prompt, you can enter:

HEAD to display the headlines of your hits. The order in which
these will be displayed depends upon the global option settings you
have established.  After the headlines are displayed, you can then
choose to display the full text of any that interest you.

TEXT to display the full text of all of your hits, in a
particular folder or for all folders. (Note: To display the full text
of all hits in all folders, you must have entered ALL at the "Enter
foldername" prompt.)

SORT to set temporary sort specifications for your hits.  These
sort settings will remain active in the current folder for the
current NewsFlash session only.

SUMMARY to display a count of saved and unviewed hits in each of
your folders.

ANALYZE to display a service code breakdown of publications in
which hits were found for a particular phrase or phrases.

RETRIEVE to retrieve saved and deleted hits.

Using the HEAD command is explained below.

Displaying Headlines and Text Using the HEAD Command

The most commonly used command to review NewsFlash hits is the
HEAD command. HEAD allows you to review the full text of your
headlines, and then select headlines numbers of which to review full
text.

To review the headlines of your NewsFlash hits, enter HEAD at the
top-level hit display prompt:

Enter HEAd for headlines; TExt; SOrt, SUmmary, ANALYZE; or Retrieve
(saved or deleted hits)
 -->HEAD

The order and format in which your hits will be displayed is
determined by your global options settings. If you have not changed
these settings, your hits will be displayed as follows:

Any saved hits you have waiting will be displayed before unviewed
hits (hits you have not seen before).

Headlines will be displayed one screen at a time (approximately
four to five headlines per screen, depending on the length of the
headlines).

Hits will be sorted first by issue date from earliest to latest,
and then within that sort, alphabetically by keyword phrase.

After you enter HEAD and the first group of headlines is
displayed, you will be prompted as follows:

Enter Headline number(s) or ALL to read; PREview, AGain, SAve, Delete,
Renew (hits); More or <RETURN> for more hits
 -->

Your choices at this prompt are:


To display the full text of one or more headlines, enter the
headline numbers here. To display the full text of all headlines
in this group, enter ALL.

Separate multiple headline numbers with spaces.

PREVIEW to display just the few first lines of articles. After
entering PREVIEW, you will be prompted to enter the headline numbers.

AGAIN to display this group of headlines again.

SAVE to save any or all of the headline numbers displayed. You
can save headlines when you don't have time to display the full text
of them, or when you've displayed them, but want have them be
displayed again the next time you review saved hits. Saved hits are
retained for two days.

DELETE to delete any of the headlines in this group.  You will
then be prompted to enter the number or numbers of the headlines that
you want to delete.

RENEW to return hits to unviewed status. Renewed hits will appear
the next time you display unviewed hits. You are not charged another
clipping charge for renewed hits.

Enter MORE to leave this group of headlines and go to the next
page of headlines. The first group of headlines will be either saved,
deleted, or renewed, according to your global option setting.  The
default setting is DELETE.

Unless you have changed your global option settings, hits will
be deleted after you view them. Note that this default applies only to
unviewed hits, however. Once hits are saved or deleted, they will
retain that status until you specifically request otherwise.

Note that if you enter BACK, QUIT, or STOP at this point in hit
display, any remaining hits will remain unviewed or saved--whatever
they were before you entered hit display.

Pressing <RETURN> at this prompt is identical to entering MORE.


After you have viewed all the available headlines, you will see
a prompt:

Enter headline number(s) or ALL to read; PREview, AGain, SAve, Delete,
Renew (hits); or <RETURN> to continue
 -->

This prompt is the same as the one displayed after each page of
headlines, except that since there are no more headlines to be
displayed in this group, MORE is not an option. <RETURN> brings you to
the next prompt.

After your saved hits are displayed, you will be notified that
display of this category is complete, and you will then be brought to
the "Enter headline number(s) to read...<RETURN> to continue" prompt.
Press <RETURN>, and the first group of your unviewed hits will be
displayed.

The box below illustrates use of the HEAD command to review
hits.  Note that in this example, the order and format of the hits
have been determined by standard option settings.

You can customize NewsFlash hit display to suit your
specifications.  For more details, call NewsNet Customer Service at
800-345-1301.

SPECIAL HIT DISPLAY COMMANDS FOR ADVANCED USERS


by: George Pickul
    Software Development Programmer

In order to provide a simple, uncluttered environment, the
NewsFlash hit display software contains several "hidden" commands and
a number of special command options.

The "hidden" commands are not included in the list of suggested
commands displayed by typing a ? at any prompt in hit display, simply
because while they offer the flexibility required by the advanced
NewsFlash user, they may confuse novice users.  The special command
options increase the flexibility of several basic NewsFlash commands.

The hidden commands are all based on common NewsFlash commands, but
have an asterisk (*) appended to the end of the command. ALL, for
example, is a valid command at several prompts in NewsFlash; ALL* is a
hidden command with a special meaning.

Three Special Commands

There are three of these special "star" commands: ALL*, HEAD*, and
DELETE*.  These three commands work in a similar way to basic
NewsFlash hit display commands, but act on a larger group of hits.
They were created to aid the downloader and those who have to manage
large groups of NewsFlash hits.

Since each of these three commands is similar to another NewsFlash
command, they have been omitted from the prompts, and cannot be
abbreviated. They are intended specifically for the advanced user who
needs to access NewsFlash hits quickly and efficiently.

ALL*

The ALL* command displays the full text of all hits of the currently
selected type (saved hits, for example, or saved and unviewed hits),
and then changes the status of these hits to deleted. ALL* is
especially useful for those subscribers who want to print or download
the full text of all of their hits, and then quickly delete them.
Since ALL* was designed for downloading, the paging of text is
disabled.

ALL* can be entered at three different prompts in the NewsFlash hit
display system.

If you wish ALL* to operate on all of your folders, enter ALL* at the
"Enter foldername, List (existing folders), or RENOTIFY" prompt, the
first prompt displayed upon entering the NewsFlash hit display
system. The full text of all of the hits from all of your folders
will be displayed, and then deleted.

ALL* can also be used to operate on all of your folders if you enter
ALL at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders), or RENOTIFY"
prompt, and then enter ALL* at the next prompt, "Enter HEAD for all
headlines or TEXT for all text."

If you only wish to view the hits from single folder, first specify a
foldername at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders) or
RENOTIFY" prompt, and then enter ALL* at the next prompt, "Enter HEAd
for headline; Text for full text..."

The order in which hits are displayed, and the type of hits displayed
(saved, unviewed, or deleted), using the ALL* command, are determined
by your global options settings and any sort order changes made using
the SORT command.

ALL* can also be used in conjunction with the RETRIEVE command to
display the full text of all of your saved or deleted hits in a
particular folder.

HEAD*

The HEAD* command acts in a similar manner to that of the ALL*
command, and can be entered at the same prompts.  Instead of
displaying the full text of the hits and then deleting them as ALL*
does, however, HEAD* displays the headlines of all of your hits, and
changes the status of the hits to saved. HEAD* was designed to give
you a quick index of your hits: you can print or download the entire
group of headlines quickly, and then re-enter NewsFlash hit display
later to display full text of selected headlines.

DELETE*

The DELETE* command was created in order to let you qickly delete
large groups of hits. DELETE*, which can be entered at the "Enter
headline number(s) to read, ALL, AGain..." prompt, deletes all of
your remaining hits of the selected type (saved or unviewed), without
your having to delete them page by page or having to display them.
It's equivalent to the command STOP in the former version of
NewsFlash.

Other Command Options

When you access hits from all of your folders, you can bypass the
"Enter HEAD for all headlines or TEXT..." prompt that is displayed
immediately after you specify ALL at the "Enter foldername, List
(existing folders), or RENOTIFY" prompt. Simply add one of two
special command options to the ALL command: enter ALL -HEAD, or ALL
-TEXT.

ALL -HEAD, entered at the "Enter foldername, List (existing folders),
or RENOTIFY" prompt, displays the headlines of hits from all of your
folders. ALL -TEXT, similarly, displays the full text of the hits
afrom all of your folders.

The command HEAD also supports two options: -BRIEF and -DETAIL. When
included on the same line as the HEAD command, the current headline
display format is changed from the setting specified in your global
options to either BRIEF format or DETAILED format.  HEAD is the
command issued to view the headlines of your hits, after you have
specified a foldername or all folders at the "Enter foldername..."
prompt first displayed upon entering hit display, or when using the
RETRIEVE command to view the headlines of saved or deleted hits.

The PAGING command in the new NewsFlash allows the use of four
different command options: -HEAD, -TEXT, -BOTH, -NONE.

The command PAGING, followed by any of these four options, can be
entered at any prompt in NewsFlash. The -TEXT option causes the full
text of NewsFlash hits to be displayed on page at a time. Entering
PAGING -HEAD will cause just headlines to be paged. Both headlines
and full text will be paged if you enter  PAGING -BOTH, and PAGING -
NONE disables paging completely.

For More Details

More details on all of these commands and command options are
available in the updated NewsFlash section of the NewsNet User
Documentation, being mailed to you within the next few weeks, and by
calling NewsNet Customer Service at 800-345-1301 or 215-527-8030.

THE NEWSFLASH CONVERSION PROCESS: WHAT YOU'LL SEE

If you're already a NewsFlash user, you may be wondering if your
existing NewsFlash profile will be compatible with the new NewsFlash
software, and if so, how the conversion will take place.

The new NewsFlash will be released gradually, a group of subscribers
at a time, starting at the end of January.

About a week before your NewsFlash profile is scheduled to be
converted, you will receive a call from a NewsNet representative, who
can answer any questions you may have about the conversion process.
When your profile has been converted, a special message will be
displayed automatically upon signon, letting you know that the new
NewsFlash is now active for you.

Your New Folder

Since the new NewsFlash is based upon groupings of keyword phrases
called "folders," a folder will be placed on your NewsNet account.
This folder, called FOLDER0001, will contain converted versions of
your existing keyword phrases.  All hits from your old NewsFlash
profile will also be transferred to this new folder.

Logical Changes

In the current version of NewsFlash, there is only one logical
connector: the + sign, used between terms to indicate AND. You can
also monitor exact, literal phrases, called "strings", merely by
leaving a space between the terms (INTEREST RATE, for example, would
be searched by the new NewsFlash as an exact phrase).

The new version of NewsFlash supports complete Boolean logic, like
that used with NewsNet's SEARCH command. The connectors AND, OR, and
BUT NOT can now be used, as can proximity searching, parentheses, and
quotation marks to indicate exact, literal phrases ("INTEREST RATE",
for example).

The + sign is no longer operative in the new version of NewsFlash,
and phrases not enclosed in quotation marks will be treated as they
are in SEARCH: as containing an implied AND connector. INTEREST RATE
in the new NewsFlash, for example, will be interpreted as INTEREST AND
RATE.

Your existing phrases will be converted automatically to the new
logical scheme:

    o  All + signs will be removed from your phrases, and
       replaced with the connector AND.

    o  All phrases now used as string searches (INTEREST RATE)
       will be enclosed in quotation marks ("INTEREST RATE").

    o  Any incorrect logical connectors accepted by the old
       NewsFlash (commas, for example) will be removed during the
       conversion.

Check Your Phrases

It is important that you check your phrases to make sure they have
been converted correctly. As soon as you receive the signon
notification letting you know that your NewsFlash profile has been
converted, enter the new NewsFlash set-up system by entering FLASH at
NewsNet's main command prompt (Enter command or <RETURN>).  At the
next prompt, enter LIST -ALL. Your converted profile will be
displayed.

Should you need to make changes to your profile, use the MODIFY
command. Enter FLASH at NewsNet's main command prompt, and, at the
next prompt, enter MODIFY.

After entering MODIFY, you will be prompted to enter OPTIONS or
PHRASES. Enter  PHRASES to change phrases, enter MODIFY at the next
prompt to change phrases, and then follow the prompts through
changing your existing phrases.  Figure 2 illustrates using the
MODIFY command to change existing phrases. [NOTE: THIS EXAMPLE
APPEARS IN THE PRINTED EDITION]

Option Settings

The new NewsFlash system also allows you to set global option
settings, used to customize the way your hits are delivered; folder
option settings, used to determine when monitoring should begin, how
hits should be sorted, and more; and phrase option settings, and
phrase option settings, which include the actual phrase being
monitored, service codes, exclusions, and when the phrase is to
become active.

For converted phrases, standard settings will be established for
your entire group of phrases (FOLDER0001).

Global Options

The standard global options settings created for you by the conversion
process determine that your hits will be delivered in the following
manner:

    o  Unviewed hits (NewsFlash hits that you have not seen
       before) will be displayed automatically when you sign on.

    o  If you have previously viewed your NewsFlash hits and
       saved any of them, all saved hits will be displayed before
       unviewed hits. Saved hits are retained for two days.

    o  After you display unviewed hits, they will be deleted
       unless you specifically request that they be saved or
       renewed (returned to unviewed status).

    o  The headlines of your NewsFlash hits will be paged
       (information will be delivered one screen at a time). Full
       text of any articles you display will not be paged.

Folder Options

    o  Your folder activity status has been set to active, which
       means that your phrases are being actively monitored.

    o  Your hits are sorted first by issue date, earliest to
       latest, and then, within that sort, alphabetically by
       keyword phrase.

    o  Your headlines are shown in brief format, which means that
       approximately four headlines will be displayed per page of
       headlines.

Phrase Options

    o  Services cross-referenced to the services you are
       monitoring with NewsFlash will automatically be included.

    o  If you are currently monitoring ALL services,
       cross-referencing will be set to NOT APPLICABLE.

    o  The maximum number of hits you will receive from a phrase
       each day is 50.

To Change These Options

Any or all of these option settings can be adjusted to your
specifications.

To change your global option settings, enter FLASH at NewsNet's main
command prompt (Enter command or <RETURN>), and then at the next
prompt, enter OPTIONS. You will be prompted through changing.

To change your folder option settings, enter FLASH at NewsNet's main
command prompt, and when prompted to enter "CReate, Modify, Delete,
Undelete...", enter MODIFY. The next prompt will ask you to enter
OPTIONS or PHRASES.  To change folder options, enter  OPTIONS, and
follow the prompts through changing.

To change your phrase option settings, enter FLASHat NewsNet's main
command prompt, and, at the next prompt, enter MODIFY. When prompted
to enter OPTIONS or PHRASES, enter  PHRASES.  The next prompt asks
you to specify whether you would like to add, modify, delete,
undelete, or list phrases; enter MODIFY, and then follow the prompts
through changing your phrase option settings.

THE EVOLVING ONLINE DATABASE INDUSTRY

Over 25 years ago the commercial online database industry was born through
products such as Lockheed's Dialog and SDC's Orbit  with  their federally-
funded counterparts  such  as  NASA/Recon,  DOE/Recon  and Medlars.  These
services were begun when the "mainframe was king"  and  users accessed the
systems through "dumb terminals"  over private telecommunications networks
managed  by  these companies or   telecommunications  partners. Since that
time  there  have  been  major  changes  in  the  business,  computer  and
networking industries which have caused evolutionary changes in the online
field in  terms of  technology,  networking,  changing  economics  and new
advancements.  Probably  the two  most  significant  impacts  in  the last
quarter century are the emergence of  the international  Internet  and the
tremendous price/performance  advancements  in  computer  technology which
bring connectivity and very powerful computer technology  into every level
of the workplace and home.

The 'Gale Directory of  Databases',  long considered a "Bible" of database
selection  and mirror  of  the online  industry,  has listed around 10,000
databases from  3,500  database  producers  and  vended  through  over 800
online service providers.  Yet, with the emergence of the Internet and low
cost computing,  this measure is losing much meaning.   Literally hundreds
of  thousands of  database and  information services are  now available on
the Internet  from  the largest firms to  individuals at  home  using well
documented and easily  accessible  technology  such as the World  Wide Web
through which information can be organized and presented.  Everyone admits
that this  proliferation of  online  services  and tools is  confusing and
there are many poor services on the net,  and yet,  this trend is changing
the  way in  which traditional online  service providers must  address the
market.  Information producers no longer  necessarily need to go  to major
online vendors for providing wide scale access to  their information [yes,
there are still many advantages in doing so] and yet many are  now putting
their own online services directly on the Internet.

The Evolution of Computers and Networking

   *  Low cost access  to the  Internet through myriads  of local Internet
   service providers has meant that  the largest companies  to  home users
   can contract for connectivity at prices which are scalable to needs.

   *  Networking technology can now be purchased in bandwidth chunks which
   are scalable  to  local needs.   For  example,  high speed modems (e.g.
   28.8  Kbps)  which work over regular phone lines are under $200, easier
   access to ISDN [64 Kbps] is available in the home and office,  lowering
   costs of leased lines for higher speeds can even  provide T1  speeds at
   prices affordable by small businesses.

   *  Newer networking technology such as frame relay, ATM and plans being
   offered by  cable and phone companies for  optical  fiber  or  TV cable
   access to  the Internet  bring the hope  of  even  higher  bandwidth at
   affordable prices.

   *  Computing power in terms of instructions per  second has experienced
   huge growth ... Many PCs and Unix  boxes now have  more computing power
   than  supercomputers  of a  decade ago.   Intel's Pentium Pro processor
   currently  is  clocked at  200  MHz  and indications are that  the fast
   evolution  in processors will  continue.   DEC currently produces a 266
   MHz Alpha RISC Chip, Sun Microsystems now has RISC UltraSPARC chips  at
   just under 200  MHz,  and  the PowerPC RISC  chips being produced  as a
   cooperative venture with Motorola and IBM are in the same  speed range.
   Truly phenomenal computing speed is widely available.

   *   Hard   disk   storage   technology   has   experienced   the   same
   price/performance  improvements  as  the  microprocessor.   It  is  now
   difficult to buy disks with less than  1  gigabyte of storage at prices
   of just a few hundred dollars.  Many suppliers are commonly offering  1
   GB to 9 GB drives at very low costs per byte.

   * CD-ROM technology has found its niche in the home market for easy and
   cheap distribution  of  games,  databases and application  programs.  A
   quad-speed or faster CD-ROM is  now considered a  standard feature with
   most PCs.

   * Full multimedia on PCs and over the Internet are now commonplace.

   * The  operating systems which seem to be dominating the marketplace at
   this time are Windows 95  for individual  users,  Windows NT for larger
   multiuser database access and Unix.   There has been a dramatic decline
   in the use of traditional mainframe operating systems.

   *  About 80%  of the local area  network (LAN)  market is  now  held by
   Novell.  However,  it  is unclear whether  this will begin to  erode as
   multiuser operating systems such as Windows NT may make traditional LAN
   technology obsolete.   Clearly, Novell and other LAN developers need to
   offer a rich body of features and make their products  easier-to-use to
   keep ahead of the Microsoft juggernaut.

Evolution of System Features

   *  Many companies which began as producers of databases of CD-ROMs have
   now  broadened  their  market  to  offering  their  search  engines and
   databases for local loading under Unix or Windows NT.  Examples of this
   include  SilverPlatter with  their ERL service which  allows  the local
   loading  of  databases for multiuser access  under SCO Unix  or Solaris
   (Sun's version of Unix)  and they are beta testing a Windows NT version
   of  ERL.  Ovid Technologies (formerly called  CDPlus Technologies which
   shows their CD-ROM  origins)  is now primarily  distributing its search
   engines and databases for local Unix  servers.   Ovid  uses  CD-ROMs to
   distribute database  updates which local sites  copy  to  hard  disk to
   provide widescale multiuser access.

   *  Many companies which originally were not database vendors have moved
   into this marketplace because it nicely complements other products they
   vend.  For example, many developers of integrated library systems (CARL
   Corporation,  Ameritech's  VISTA  System,  Innovative  Interfaces  Inc.
   INN-VIEW system,  DRA operates the Open DRA Net service and others) now
   centrally mount suites of databases.   Although users of these services
   are typically  libraries  which  use  a  particular  integrated library
   system,  most of  these  vendors  are  trying  to  make  broader market
   penetration. Traditional cataloging utilities such as OCLC, RLG and WLN
   have all moved into the database vending market.  Their success in this
   is due to  a large existing  customer  base,  and  synergism with other
   products  they  offer (e.g.  link to  holdings, ILL/document delivery).
   Many publishers and database producers are beginning to offer their own
   online services.  Examples include Information Access Company (IAC) who
   has its own online system while still licensing its databases  to other
   vendors or  individual  sites;  EBSCO has  launched  its  own EBSCOhost
   system for offering its databases and those of  others,  Academic Press
   is  offering  its entire  family  of  print journals  on  the  Web, and
   Elsevier is offering  its huge  journal product in  electronic form for
   local loading.

   *  Online service providers are augmenting their traditional ASCII text
   search  interfaces  with  graphical user interfaces (gui).   Two trends
   seem  to  be  predominant -  many vendors are offering  proprietary gui
   clients for use with their specific online  system which  are rich with
   features;  many online services are now offering  web server  access to
   their database servers so that a person can use a standard  web browser
   (e.g.  Netscape,  Mosaic, Lynx) to search databases.  Web server access
   to database servers is advantageous because one does not  need to worry
   about client software distribution and the problems of  illegal copying
   of proprietary software.

   * Z39.50 client/server compliance is now supported by many major online
   services such  as CARL Corporation,  DRA,  Ameritech VISTA, EBSCO, OCLC
   FirstSearch, IAC, Innovative Interfaces, Ovid Technologies, RLG Citadel
   and SilverPlatter.   Thus users can select  the Z39.50  client of their
   choice and have a common  interface to many different  online services.
   Clearly this standard is still  rapidly evolving and  Z39.50 clients do
   not offer the rich  range of  features  as proprietary  clients and yet
   most feel that  the Z39.50  protocol holds great promise.   A number of
   Z39.50  clients now offer the ability  to  launch  searches  to several
   servers at the same time (e.g. DRA, Search Access).

   *  A  "link to  holdings"  feature  is  now  offered  by  some vendors.
   Although this can be handled in different  ways,  the main idea is that
   when a user  looks at  a bibliographic citation  (if full  text  is not
   online) the system indicates if a local library owns the citation. OCLC
   and RLG can perform this at the "title level"  for sites who catalog on
   their   systems.    Local  ILS  vendors   (e.g.  Ameritech,  Innovative
   Interfaces,  DRA)  can often link  to a serial summary  holdings record
   assuming the library uses the vendor in question.   Some products allow
   a library to create electronic lists of holdings statements  (e.g. IAC)
   so that when a citation is retrieved holdings show, and EBSCO indicates
   title  level ownership  information  on  its  EBSCOhost  service  if an
   organization uses  the EBSCO subscription  services  for  serials. Ovid
   Technologies does a Z39.50 call to a local Z39.50 compliant ILS so that
   the holdings information is  then  returned and displayed  to the user.
   The  link  is  up-to-date  and  does  not  require   the  creation  and
   maintenance of a second holdings file.

   *  Full scanned images are being commonly delivered by products such as
   UMI PowerPages, IAC, EBSCO and others. Full-text ASCII delivery is also
   common through vendors such as IAC, EBSCO, LEXIS-NEXIS and others.

   *  When full-text is not available online  (in either  ASCII or scanned
   images)  most online systems now offer the ability to launch a document
   delivery or ILL request.

   *  Multilingual support is  now being offered  more  frequently through
   PC-based  clients.   This  is  especially  important  with  the diverse
   American  culture  and  the  greater  internationalization   of  online
   services because of the Internet.

   *  Natural  language search interfaces  are appearing on  many consumer
   products such as "Homework Helper"  by Infonautics,  Cognito by IAC and
   EyeQ by DataTimes.

   *  Greater  sophistication  in  mapping natural language  to controlled
   vocabulary  is  appearing (e.g.  Ovid has extensive  abilities  in this
   area)  and  the ability for users to  interact  authority  or thesaural
   files is commonplace.

Changing Economics

Probably the biggest  financial trend in  the online industry in  the last
five years has been  a growing use of  "flat fee"  pricing  algorithms for
libraries and other institutions.   This originally began in the mid-1980s
when  academic  and  public  libraries  began  to  shift  away  from using
commercial timesharing services  for high-use databases  and replaced them
with CD-ROMs which could be  licensed for  a flat annual fee.   This trend
continued to evolve into the local loading of  databases  in institutional
database servers and has now gone full circle to  libraries demanding flat
fee pricing from online service providers.   This flat fee pricing through
online service providers has been challenging since one must get agreement
from  the  online  vendor  and  the  database  producer.   This  is  often
complicated by  factors such as libraries wanting to  subscribe  in groups
through consortia.   Online vendors and database producers  have developed
many unique pricing algorithms to maintain revenue while responding to the
need in many institutions for fixed fee pricing so  they  can manage tight
budgets.   The  most  common  algorithm  usually  involves  some  type  of
concurrent  user  model.   Most libraries,  however, still use many of the
commercial timesharing services for medium and low use databases where the
institution wants occasional access to many different files.

Many vendors are also developing personal pricing strategies in an attempt
to provide low cost access to database services over the  Internet for the
individual.   Typically,  these  involve billing or  credit  card payments
which an individual can afford  and the vendor  hopes to make a  profit in
volume.

Some  online  services  offer their  search  engine  for  free  if  a site
subscribes  to  or  locally   loads   some   of   their   databases  (e.g.
SilverPlatter, IAC,  most databases from ILS vendors) ... the library only
pays for the  database  subscription.   However,  there  are  some notable
exceptions   such  as  Ovid   Technologies   or   OCLC   SiteSearch  where
organizations are willing to pay a premium for specialized services.

Conclusion

With the emergence of the Internet and low-cost high-powered computing the
online industry is in a state of  flux.  Many traditional online providers
need to be flexible to respond to user needs.   Online services need to be
powerful  and yet easy-to-use,  must  be  client-centered,  and  must have
pricing options for many different market segments.  [GSM]

GALILEO: UNIV OF GEORGIA USING OCLC SITESEARCH AND WEBZ DATABASE PRODUCTS

The University System of Georgia is offering a suite  of bibliographic and
full-text  databases  to  34  state-supported  academic  libraries through
GALILEO,  the Georgia Library Learning Online System.  GALILEO offers over
50  databases using OCLC SiteSearch Z39.50  Server System coupled with the
OCLC WebZ software which lets  users access  the system  over the Internet
using standard web browsers.

This aggressive  project was spearheaded by William Gray Potter, director,
University of  Georgia.   "We wanted full Z39.50  compatibility with a Web
browser ... We know  we wanted  to  take  a client-server approach  but we
didn't want to be in the business of attempting to distribute and maintain
a proprietary client.  And  we  wanted  to provide  ready integration with
OCLC's FirstSearch  service.  With  SiteSearch  and  WebZ,  we're  able to
perform all these functions."

Two parallel SiteSearch systems are being run at the University of Georgia
and  Georgia  State  University  to  distribute  the   load  for   the  34
participating institutions.   Some of the databases are locally loaded and
some are offered on a pass-through basis to the FirstSearch system at OCLC
in Ohio.  Databases  offered  include  a suite  of   periodical  indexing/
abstracting services, an encyclopedia and full-text to over 1,100 journals
from EBSCO.

High-use files or files of local interest are put on the  local SiteSearch
servers while other databases are offered seamlessly  through FirstSearch.
In the future,  the  Galileo project  will  offer  scanned  document image
databases including the Georgia archives and state documents. In addition,
other libraries in the state will be brought into  the project to  build a
statewide network available to all residents of the state.

For more information on OCLC's SiteSearch and WebZ  products contact: OCLC
Online Computer Library Center,  6565  Frantz Road, Dublin, OH 43017-3395.
Telephone: (614) 764-6000. Fax: (614) 764-6096.

OCLC OFFERS PASSPORT SOFTWARE FOR WINDOWS

In 1990,  OCLC released  a DOS-based  telecommunications  software product
called Passport which was designed to be used with the OCLC online system.
In December  1995,  OCLC released  the first Windows  version  of Passport
which takes advantage of many of the standard Windows features.   Prior to
release OCLC did a three month field test with 18 libraries.

Some of the special advantages of Passport for Windows include the ability
for users to cut and paste information from OCLC to a local library system
window; training time is reduced and it is easier for occasional users; it
offers a  macro language which  allows catalogers to  create pop-up dialog
boxes which can be used  to easily modify  information in  a local system;
and  it  offers  the scripting of  authorizations  and  passwords  to OCLC
FirstSearch and other OCLC online services.

OCLC has indicated that  they  will  continue  to make the DOS  version of
Passport available to users.

STAR/WEB OFFERS WWW ACCESS TO THE CUADRA STAR SYSTEM

For  many  years Cuadra  Associates  Inc.  has produced  the  popular STAR
information retrieval system.  In December 1995, the company announced the
availability of  STAR/Web  which allows  any web  browser  to  access STAR
databases over  the Internet.  STAR/Web uses  a  common  gateway interface
(cgi)  program that connects STAR  software to any standard  or commercial
World  Wide  Web  server   (http  daemon).   With  the  product,  database
administrators  can let users of their  Web hosts use a STAR database with
any   standard  web  browser,  thus  mitigating  the  need  to  distribute
proprietary client software.

The STAR system is widely used in libraries,  museums, government agencies
and other organizations who must index print and non-print collections.

Some special features of STAR/Web include:

   *  System administrators  can design  web pages for full-text  or index
   searches that include multiple input boxes.

   *  Index displays  on  the assisted  search  screens  help users select
   applicable search terms to be pasted into the appropriate input boxes.

   *  Administrators  can pre-define  applicable  Boolean,  proximity  and
   ranging operators.

   * Ordering facilities are supported for document delivery.

   *  STAR/Web maintains their "state" in which the user views the initial
   search results.   When  users  select  a  hypertext  link, conventional
   search engines immediately forget what the user entered as search text.
   STAR/Web retains what the user has entered and selected.

   *  The product allows  the  system  administrator  to  design  the html
   screens and has tools  to present and  sort information to the  user in
   many different ways.

For more information contact:  Cuadra Associates Inc.,  11835 West Olympic
Blvd.,  Los Angeles, CA 90064.  Telephone: (800) 366-1390, (310) 478-0066.

CHANGE: THE INEVITABLE - AS ONLINE COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGY RACE AHEAD

Change: it's inevitable - as online users are keenly aware.

It's not just the technology that  jumps in quantum leaps - it's  also the
companies that make up the online  industry that are either being left  by
the wayside,  or being  gobbled up,  or merging  to make  up the new super
conglomerates worldwide.

Probably  the  biggest  impetus  has  been  the  huge growth of the online
industry over the past several years due to the beckoning online  consumer
market and the fact that even  the professional online user market is  now
end-user oriented (and not libraries as it was a decade ago).

Of recent note in the area of mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures:

Encyclopedia Britannica,  the 227  year-old company  - which  was late  in
bringing its product online and then also introducing a too-expensive  CD-
ROM -  is being  acquired by  the Swiss-based  investor Jacob  Safra. EB's
chairman and  president, Joseph  Esposito, was  quoted as  saying the sale
would "intensify  its focus  and efforts  in extending  the vast editorial
wealth of the  Britannica, as well  as in strengthening  our leadership on
the World Wide Web."

CCH Incorporated, a leading provider of tax and business law  information,
software, and  services is  being acquired  under an  agreement by Wolters
Kluwer NV, an international publisher of print and electronic  information
for  professionals  and  business  for  approximately  $1.9  billion.  The
transaction places  Wolters Kluwer  in the  position of  being one  of the
world's  largest  and  leading  professional  publishers,  with   combined
anticipated revenues of more than $2.4 billion. The move also provides the
Dutch company with strengthening its presence in North America.

Responsive  Database  Services,  Inc.  (Beachwood,  OH),  producer  of the
Business &  Industry (tm)  database (B&I),  and headed  by president  Dick
Harris (formerly the head of Predicasts), has announced its acquisition of
the News  Services Group  (NSG) of  BIS Strategic  Decisions, Inc. (Luton,
England) for an undisclosed sum.  NSG will be renamed Responsive  Database
Services,  Ltd.  (RDSL).  With  the  acquisition,  RDSI  will  extend  its
locations  at  which  it  processes  data  for its B&I database. RDSI will
invest  in  the  market  development  of  its RDSI "customized information
services"  used  by  major  companies  throughout  the  world.  RDSI  also
publishes topical newsletters in the information technology field such  as
'IT Today', and 'IT Focus'.

ISI has announced its introduction of the company's new line of  Internet-
delivered  alerting  services  called  "Research  Alert  Direct" (tm) (RAD
(tm)). Six end-user desktop product packages will be introduced:  "Journal
Tracker"  (tm),   "Personal  Alert"   (tm),  "Professional   Alert"  (tm),
"Corporate Alert" (tm), "Topics Select"  (tm), and "Focus On". All  of the
RAD products  are drawn  from ISI's  multidisciplinary database  searching
over 16,000 leading international  science, social sciences and  arts, and
humanities  journals,  books,  and  proceedings.  RAD  provides   current,
complete bibliographic information that matches a user's profile. The  new
product offering will become available in the first quarter of 1996.

Cambridge  Scientific  Abstracts  has  recently  signed  an agreement with
SilverPlatter  Information  to  license  SilverPlatter's ERL technology to
build  37  abstract  journal  databases  which  will  be  accessible using
SilverPlatter's SPIRS. The  databases will be  mounted on CSA's  server in
Bethesda, Maryland,  and will  be available  for customers  to access  via
CSA's Internet Database Service (IDS).

It was quite a few years ago that we envisioned "erasable optical  discs".
That  vision  has  eluded  many,  primarily  because  the cost of magnetic
storage (which -is- erasable) came  down dramatically in price. (The  cost
of a 1 Gigabyte  drive is now about  $300.) Then came WORM  CD-ROM drives,
CDR - and now HDCD (High Density CD). Users who bought single speed CD-ROM
drives in the late eighties soon found that double-speed (2x) drives  were
now required  for many  applications, such  as multimedia.  Now 4x  CD-ROM
drives  are  common  and  8x  drives  are just being introduced. Differing
standards  by   different  manufacturers   all  helped   to  quash  CD-ROM
development  over  the  past  years.  Now  new  light  has  shone with the
agreement on standards  by major worldwide  CD-ROM manufacturers both  for
high density CD,  and truly erasable  CD-ROMs. -- But  will we be  able to
afford it?

While Microsoft's  Windows 95  made a  splashy debut  in 1995, Microsoft's
decision to use 16-bit technology instead of 32-bit reflects the fact that
most 16-bit online and  PC users still represent  the bulk of the  market.
That  was  Gates'  hedge  on  making  sure  the  product would sell - also
recognizing the fact  that not everyone  is as eager  to hand out  dollars
just to be the "first kid on the block" with the new technology. Ditto  on
Intel's Pentium chip which  cannot significantly utilize its  higher speed
for the majority of Windows 95 users.

Development of the Internet is probably a good reflection and  measurement
of just how much technology can race ahead of users. There is currently  a
rush for virtually everyone and every company and organization  throughout
the world  to get  on the  World Wide  Web (ourselves included). Software,
browsers, databases, services,  email - and  you name it  - abound on  the
Internet. Unfortunately, for online and PC users, not all of the  products
are compatible with -your- system, and  tech support can soak up a  lot of
user time (whether it's  for free or -fee-).  -- All said however,  online
and PC users -should-  use the Internet as  an indicator of the  advancing
technology - as it is happening!

We are all looking forward to  1996 to see just what new  developments are
coming down the information superhighway - not to mention that we'd prefer
not to have our pockets picked along the way. [RSH]

PRINT SCREEN: NEW SOFTWARE FOR WINDOWS

One of the niceties of using MS-DOS was that users could capture and print
out  a  screen  of  data  by  simply entering Shift/Print Screen. With the
advent of Windows, that option went the route of the dinosaurs.

Now  JE  Software  has  introduced  Print  Screen  2.0  for  Windows  that
essentially does the same wonderful thing - and then some.

The program, which works with Windows.3x, Windows 95, or Windows NT,  does
it with a -single- keystroke.

The Print Screen program enables printing the active window or full screen
to any Windows  printer, fax device,  or disk. Users  can also stretch  or
shrink  the  image,  save  it  in  normal or reverse (negative) format, or
choose the printer's portrait or landscape mode.

The product enables users to be able to virtually perform the task of  "If
you can see it,  you can print it."  routine - including images  from both
online -and- CD-ROM applications.

The Print Screen Auto-Save feature  also enables users to save  the screen
to a sequentially numbered .bmp file which can be loaded into most Windows
programs. Settings can be made for automatic print, save, or none - or any
combination of these functions.

Printers required  for these  images require  a laser  printer, dot-matrix
printer capable of graphics, or a combination printer/fax machine.  ASCII-
type printers are not supported.

Print  Screen  2.0  for  Windows  costs  $29.95 for a single-user license.
Network and site licenses are available.

For  further  information  contact:  Janesway Electronics Corporation, 404
North Terrace Avenue, Mount Vernon, NY 10552. Telephone: (800) 431-1348 or

INSPEC TO COVER ELECTRONIC JOURNALS - BACKFILES LOADED ON OCLC

During 1996,  the INSPEC  database, produced  by the  IEE (Institution  of
Electrical Engineers),  will extend  its coverage  of electronic  journals
that are available in  electronic form. The type  of journal that will  be
selected  for  indexing  must  contain  peer-reviewed  articles, which are
permanently stored into an archive maintained by a publisher. Examples  of
journals that will be scanned for the INSPEC database include "The Journal
of  Artificial  Intelligence  Research"   (published  by  the  AI   Access
Foundation), and "TCAD" (Technology Computer Aided Design), a  forthcoming
publication of the IEEE.

To accommodate electronic journals, some  new fields have been created  on
the INSPEC  Tape Services.  These are  Document Number  and URLs  (Uniform
Resource  Locators).  The  Document  Numbers  will  be  used  for   wholly
electronic journals (or for  electronic journals published in  parallel to
print) that give articles a unique  number. Where they are believed to  be
stable, URLs will be  given both at the  individual article level, and  at
the level of the complete journal or electronic document collection.

IEE has also announced that  the INSPEC database available on  OCLC's EPIC
and FirstSearch  services, has  been loaded  to include  the entire INSPEC
database backfile with the addition of 2.5 million records and dating back
to 1969, bringing the total number  of INSPEC records available to over  5
million records. The database is updated weekly and has been available  on
OCLC since early 1994.

INTERNET FREE SPEECH IN TROUBLE AGAIN WITH CHURCH

INTERNET FREE SPEECH IN TROUBLE AGAIN WITH CHURCH - Although the Church of
Scientology's copyright case  was dismissed by  a Denver federal  court in
1995 (see  'Online Newsletter'  October 1995  p.11), the  church is  at it
again.   --   The   church's   "hostage"   this  time  is  Netcom  On-Line
Communications, Inc.,  an Internet  service provider,  which U.S. District
Judge Ronald M. Whyte in California, has said in an unprecedented  32-page
decision  -  may  be  liable  for  alleged  copyright  infringements  by a
subscriber who  posted the  church's "sacred  texts" on  the Internet. The
person posting the  text is a  former church minister,  now turned critic,
who has  an Internet  electronic discussion  group known  as alt.religion.
scientiology. -- The case is  a critical point for -all-  online providers
because it is  the first time  that a federal  judge has ruled  whether an
Internet  access  provider  should  be  held  responsible  for   copyright
infringements by a subscriber (rather than the subscriber being targeted).
It will also determine whether First Amendment rights apply to all  online
service providers under a different set of rules - unlike phone  companies
which are  not restricted  in any  similar manner.  -- If  encouraged, the
judge's  actions  could  have  a  devastating  effect on the online field,
freedom of communications, and the  exchange of information and ideas.  --
Clearly,  swift  U.S.  Congressional   action  is  needed  to   amend  the
Telecommunications Act to ensure that these kinds of frivolous  litigation
do not tie up online industry providers or restrict online user access  in
any way. [RSH]

ADVANCE NOTES. Quietly (very quietly), a consortium of five major 

ADVANCE NOTES. Quietly (very quietly), a consortium of five major 
film/camera companies have been working together to come up with a 
new type of camera and film to meet the competition from the digital 
arena. In February they'll be unveiling their product to the 
photography industry. Using new technology ranging from magnetic 
strips on film, to printed information on the back of pictures, the 
new system, called APS (Advanced Photo System), is bound to attract 
general consumers and eventually professionals. Here's our two-part 
report:

FILM FOREVER !


Film and camera manufacturers know where the big dollar is. With your 
average consumer. These companies have secretly engineered a new 
film/camera product that is aimed at holding the deep foothold they 
have dug in the consumer industry. To keep these customers, they've 
in essence invented a new picture-taking method: the Advanced Photo 
System (APS).

WHEN YA CAN'T FIGHT 'EM


Long-time foes, KODAK and FUJI, plus three other entries (Nikon, 
Canon, and Minolta) have formed a consortium over the last five years 
in an attempt to secretly counter the obvious commercial threat to 
them from digital photography. The result of their efforts is a dream 
come true for anyone who isn't interested in f-stops, lighting 
formulae, flash factors, color balances, and all the complexities 
photography instructors build their careers on. The five companies 
will introduce the Advance Photo System to the world in February, and 
the system will be in stores by early spring.

Some highlights:

FILM. It'll be 24mm wide negative film, not transparencies. Exposures 
of 14,25, and 40. You won't get it back from the processor in those 
fingerprint-prone strips anymore. The rolled film will return in its 
original cassette. And you won't get blank film back if you loaded it 
wrong.  You can't load it wrong.
CONTACT SHEETS. You'll get back postcard-size sheets with miniature, 
numbered, color pictures on them, ready to select for print-making. 
There'll be no wasteful volume printing of everything on the roll. 
Instead, you'll select customized sizes for your pictures of top 
priority.
PRINTS. By pushing a button on the camera, you'll be able to encode 
on the film what eventual print sizes you want for specific shots, 
ranging from full-frame to panoramic views.
QUALITY. Overexposure and underexposure will be no longer be a 
problem, or at least, will be negligible. A beeper on your camera 
will ask you if you are trying to be creative or if you've made a 
wrong aperture decision.
AUDIO. On the more advanced systems, you'll get "film with smarts." 
The magnetic strip on the film will store spoken instructions and 
other data.
CAPTIONS. The magnetic strip will also automatically store 
information about the exposure, location, species, genus, model names 
and releases, or historical data. Your film processor can use the 
stored data to make exposure adjustments, on a frame-by-frame basis. 
You'll also get details (if you want them) printed out on the back of 
each finished picture.
PRICE. Film will be in the normal price ranges. Cameras will cost 
from $25 for a throw-away to big bucks for the sophisticated models.

Ten years ago, who would've thought you could make the Evening News?  
Well, not you, but the footage from your camcorder. It's possible 
today. We see it all the time.
We, the people, are all becoming reporters of the world around us. As 
a stock photographer, you have an inside avenue to the markets where 
your pictures are sold. New technology, both digital and film, is 
making it easier to record, catalog, and later transmit your images. 
Not just to the local media, but worldwide. The new Advanced Photo 
System (APS) portends to expand this influence of stock photography. 
Fasten your seat belts, the ride into the next century of photo 
illustration is going to be exciting.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
It's expected the new APS will take a few years to become accepted by 
the public. One hurdle: everyone seems to have a 35-mm camera. The 
cassettes for APS are not adaptable to standard 35mm cameras. And 
there's always the uncomfortable echo of past attempts to rejuvenate 
the sluggish consumer photography industry. Remember the "disk 
cameras" of a decade ago?
Here at PhotoSource International we see the APS system as a 
potentially excellent transition technology for both stock 
photographers and photobuyers. New companies will licence the 
technology and offer improvements and peripherals. Although the APS 
is aimed initially at the consumer market, as it matures, 
advancements will evolve as user-friendly technology fit for 
professionals and flow well with paralleling advancements in digital 
imagery. -RE

NEXT MONTH:  "APS, The Photobuyers Are Going To Love It."

For Stock Photographers....
THE INTERNET AS A WHOLE, IS A HOLE


The Internet last year as a whole doubled in size.  Or rather, as a 
hole.  It's a deep pit for the unwary stock photographer.  If there's 
any substantive commerce for independent stock photographers on the 
Internet, I'd like to hear about it.

What I read and hear about are Internet products, books, courses, WEB 
Sites, peripherals, consultant software, training, conferences, 
chats, and all other varieties of the Medicine Show.  Everyone's 
gearing up to learn, but where are the sales?

C'mon.  Someone please step forward and tell us they've found the 
Internet to be a more cost-effective way to make sales than through 
conventional methods.

The single action I see on the Internet is by amateur art directors 
who are on fishing trips, trying to reel in Clip Art prices from 
uninformed photographers.

Step aside, television, we have a new pencil sharpener, a new waste 
land for procrastinators.  We've gone beyond the word processing 
merry-go-round, Oprah, Rush, and headphones.  Now it's the Internet.

In Mark Twain or Walt Whitman's era, when writers wanted to 
procrastinate, they'd sharpen pencils.  The writer would get up from 
the desk and grind away at the pencil sharpener in an attempt to look 
like something of substance was getting accomplished.  Then 
television took over as aider and abetter to procrastinators.

Net potatoes today find the Internet an escape.

So far, the Internet can hardly be called a highway of productivity.  
An hour surfing the Internet is foolishly spent on time you could be 
advancing your stock photography career.  The Internet as a highway
has no stop lights, speed limits, guard rails, or accident 
prevention--just toll booths.

The Internet for stock photographers is populated by inexperienced 
people using tools that haven't reached maturity. But it is pumped up 
by professionals--marketing professionals who know how to take an 
empty thoroughfare and turn it into the glamour and glitter of Las 
Vegas.  Listen to the rhetoric.  Put a blindfold on and substitute 
the word "Used Car" for "Internet" and you'll recognize familiar 
hype.

But take heart, it's coming.  Many interesting things can be found at 
the bottom of a pit:  gold, diamonds, ancient coins, even crude oil!

However, don't fall into the pit without some tools to get yourself 
back out, as well as a plan to mine the pit.  You can join those 
ever-present pioneers who are ready to descend into any pit on the 
chance of ascending to greater heights.  I applaud them.

We talk by phone and fax with dozens of photobuyers each week in the 
course of our photo listing gathering here at PhotoSource 
International.  Photobuyers in the magazine and book world tell us 
they are not available on the Internet and don't plan to be soon.  If 
this changes, we'll be the first to let you know. -RE

Ed. Note: Be sure to read "The Internet: Thumbs Down -- Ten good 
reasons for stock photographers to stay out of the net."

A NEW KIND OF HIGHWAY BRIGAND


The scene is a court room.  The judge, with gavel in hand, has just 
heard a stock photographer plead his case.  The defendant, an art 
director at a mid-size ad agency, has been accused of "borrowing" 
part of the photographer's photo and using it in an ad campaign.

The gavel comes down.  The judge rules for the photographer and 
glares at the ad agency art director.  "You willfully stole part of 
this photographer's picture.  I'm going to fine you within the full 
extent of the law, $750, the price you would have had to pay for this 
photo if you had acquired it through appropriate business channels."

The ad agency director smiles.

"What?"  The photographer gasps.  "You mean someone can steal my 
photos and use them for free and if they get caught all they have to 
pay is the price they would have paid anyway for the photo if they 
would have gone through regular channels?"

"I'm afraid that's the way the Copyright Law presently reads," says 
the judge.

"Yet I have to pay my attorney, and court costs, and all my downtime, 
about $3500, that it took to pursue my rights in this case???"

Gavel comes down again.  "Next case!"  says the judge.

                   MODERN-DAY BRIGANDS

    The photographer in this case could be you.  Digital technology 
already makes it very easy for art directors to "borrow" images and 
portions of images from magazines, catalogs, posters, or original 
art, and use them for their own purposes.  They know that litigation 
is too costly for an individual photographer.  The information 
highway is producing a new kind of robber, the digital image thief.

As we travel down the information highway, no other profession will 
be as vulnerable to thievery as ours.  Parts of pictures can be 
stolen with little or no detection.

And even if you detect it, it doesn't matter whether you can prove 
that part of your photo was pilfered.  If by some remarkable chance a 
thief is found out, the way the law is interpreted now, unless the 
image has formal copyright registration protection, the robber gets 
away without punishment.  And he's free to continue to roam the 
highway, picking off victims at will.  Few photographers formally 
register every one of their pictures (at $20 per).

In medieval days, when vandals roamed the countryside, the populace 
depended on the Baron and his castle for protection.  In a sense, 
individuals were torn between the evils of vandals and the 
corruptions of land barons.

                        __________
              "...the ease of picking out parts of digital images is 
too irresistible to digit pickers..."
                        ----------

Not until citizens gained individual rights and legal protection, did 
real freedom become reality.

As individual stock photographers, we have been knocked back to 
medieval times.  Digital imagery has done this to us.  The ease of 
picking out parts of digital images is too irresistible to digit 
pickers at graphic houses and ad agencies.

Large stock agencies, with their financial resources, no doubt may 
set some precedents and win a few court battles against the digital 
vandals.  But the message to commercial art directors will be:  "If 
you see an image you want, make sure it doesn't belong to a large 
stock agency or a digital service bureau.  Instead prey on the 
individual photographer who will never be able to afford to fight 
us."

For photographers, the message will be:  "I'd better give up my 
individuality and go with a large stock agency (the Baron in the 
Castle) so he can protect me."

We need a Pied Piper, someone who will lead us away from the digital 
vandals, and away from the Barons who offer us protection but 
sometimes at the cost of our creative freedom.  We need someone who 
will set a precedent with the Copyright Office and establish painful 
repercussions in the graphics community for any pilfering of an image 
or parts of an image, whether the original belongs to a massive stock 
agency, a small stock agency, or Jane Doe producing individual photos 
from her cabin in Montana.

DIGITS IS MONEY


Eventually, the banking industry will be completely digitized.  
Already, here at the farm as one example, most of our revenue the 
form of credit card payments (digits). We use a Control Data program 
called TELEMONY to deposit these digits, and the digits end up in our 
bank via the Federal Reserve.

We also offer a program for "automatic checks," called Check-O-Matic, 
for persons who are not into credit cards. Our bank talks 
electronically to the bank where their have there checking account 
(digits).

Photos are getting digitized too. Eventually, the stock photo 
industry will be completely digitized.

MONEY IN THE BANK

It can be said that digitized photos and digitized money are becoming 
synonymous, and that if you have a bank of photos, then you have 
money in the bank.

Commerce is conducted when there's an exchange of money (digits).
However, the stock photo industry today, as well as the rest of the 
commercial community, face the same hurdles to achieve security 
systems that the banking industry faced 35 years ago when electronic 
transfer of money (digits) was introduced.

Over the past three decades, banks have produced an effective 
(secure) system for transferring digits.  No secure system exists yet 
for photos (or text), or finaicial transactions in the open 
marketplace.

Several commercial companies are focusing enery and dollars to solve 
their security problems, and some even do boast of having "secure" 
systems on the Internet.  One such firm is Netscape--but two 
announcements last year of "holes" in the Netscape Navigator have 
Internet merchants scurrying for an explanation. In one case, two 
Berkeley students cracked the program's security code and publicized 
their finding on the Internet.

By the way, if you are a programmer with a hacker's mentality and are 
looking for a gainful programming position, the best way to get to 
the head of the line is to crack the Internet and publicize your 
findings.  Industry will scoop you up and employ your talents. -RE

UPDATELESS


Inevitable: Death, Taxes, and Updates. There's no getting around it, 
updates of your software is now a fact of our digital lives. A visit 
to the library to look over some 1980's computer magazines and you 
wonder how we could've been so naive in those days. Now, when a new 
accounting program comes along we know better than to call it the 
program of the century (even with only four more years of the century 
left). We're talking maybe four more months and it'll be outdated. 
Don't fight it. Without updates (new versions) of your current 
software, you fall behind. Buy the updates; they'll be worth the 
investment. -RE

WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH COPYRIGHT CHANGES?

Not enough, according to copyright attorney, Stephen R. Bergerson.
ASMP and several other groups concerned with intellectual properties 
have attempted to introduce sensible changes to the Copyright Act, 
but with little success so far.  Photographers would like to see 
changes in Sections 104(a), 405, 406, 408(a) and 412(2), which 
require that an individual photograph be formally registered within 
three months after publication or before an infringement problem 
comes up in order to be eligible for full legal recourse.
Currently it's not feasible for photographers to go through the 
formal 
                       - - - - - - - - - - -
                     "Legislation always lags

                       - - - - - - - - - - -
registration process for each photo (and at $20 a crack), in order to 
protect themselves "just in case," so that they're eligible to 
receive statutory damages in the event infringement happens.  This 
requirement needs to be abolished in order to eliminate the loophole 
for digital thievery as presented in the theoretical case above.
"We know that copyright changes are coming.  But Congress is trying 
to find answers for questions that haven't been asked yet," says 
Bergerson.  "Electronic transmission of images is presenting a new 
playing field.  And we're wrestling with the age-old problem of 
legislation always lagging far behind technology."

ADDITIONAL PROPOSED COPYRIGHT LAW CHANGES:

SMOLAN GOES INTERNET 

On February 8th, Rick Smolan (Day In The Life series, Passages from 
Vietnam, etc.) and over 100 of the world's top photojournalists will 
take part in 24 Hours in Cyberspace. Their targets will be the most 
intriguing stories from the on-line frontier, from rural Nepal to 
Oakland's inner-city ghetto to the boardrooms of New York City. Their 
focus will be on the human stories behind the technology; the new 
ways in which we work, play, learn, conduct business and interact.
The results will be instantly visible around the world, through one 
of the largest on-line events ever produced. Images will be 
transmitted digitally back to the project's headquarters in San 
Francisco, where Smolan's team will assemble a unique "instant" World 
Wide Web site, with updates throughout the day. Simultaneously, 
millions of on-line viewers will be invited to submit their own 
stories of how the digital revolution is affecting their lives. Many 
of these stories will become part of the "instant" Web site as well.
A permanent World Wide Web site will be unveiled on March 15th, 
featuring even more in-depth stories, photo essays, and commentaries.

UNCLE SAM'S DIRECT REFUND 

Getting your Federal tax refund electronically deposited into your 
bank account no longer requires that you file your return 
electronically.  Now you can attach Form 8888 to your return (even if 
filing the old-fashioned way--via paper), and the IRS will send the 
refund directly to your bank. And, you'll get it about a week earlier 
than mailed refunds, too. Last year 68% of returns filed resulted in 
a refund, so get in line for yours!

TAX TACTICS:


WHEN YOUR CAMERA IS STOLEN
The best protection for your camera equipment, of course, is 
prevention.  Relatively recent law changes drastically tightened the 
rules on deductions for casualty theft losses. It is now much more 
difficult to qualify for tax relief when you suffer property damage 
of your photography equipment. The damage must be the result of an 
auto accident, fire, flood, vandalism, storm, theft, or some other 
event that is sudden, unexpected, or unusual in nature. Even in these 
circumstances there are restrictions.

Both the past and present rules allow write-offs for uninsured losses 
on property used for personal purposes only if you itemize your 
deductions.  Another restriction imposed by the old and current rules 
is that you cannot deduct the first $100 of loss from any casualty or 
theft incident.

Julian Block, a former IRS agent and tax attorney, is the author of "Julian
Block's Tax Avoidance Secrets" (560 pages) $33.95 (3 Washington Sq, Larchmont
NY 10538-2032).  He can be reached on PRODIGY (EXPT16B).

YOU AND THE LAW:


As a photographer your understanding of the law is crucial to the survival of
your business.

REVIEW OF AN AGENCY'S BOOKS AND RECORDS.  It's appropriate for you to 
have the right to review, or audit, your stock agency's books and 
records, as they relate to your images and sales, on a regular basis, 
upon reasonable notice.  An audit is at your cost, but if an error of 
5% or more is disclosed, the agency will usually agree to pay such 
cost.  Although it is rare for a photographer to actually conduct an 
official audit, it is important to reserve the right to be able to do 
so in your contract.

Attorney Joel L Hecker lectures and writes extensively on issues of concern to
the photography industry.  His office is located at Russo & Burke, 600 Third
Ave, New York NY 10016.  1 212 557-9600.

VERTICAL MARKETING
PART VI


FRAGMENTATION: The Gold Mine For the Photo Illustrator

There seems to be an immutable law of cyberspace that goes something 
like this, "The more information you have available, the less you 
have available." You've probably experienced the same thing when 
surfing the variety of TV channels you now have available to you: 
"There's nothing on TV anymore. Unless you want to watch the cat and 
dog show competition in Bulgaria." Human nature dictates that the 
more choices we have, the less satisfied we are.  (Ignorance is 
bliss.)

In the business world, the law of supply and demand takes over. A 
weekly cat and dog show from Bulgaria wouldn't last long if there 
were 1.) no viewers, and 2.) no sponsors. REALITY: If the show 
survives, it's because there's a market for it.

Where do you fit in? As a photo illustrator in the new generation of 
stock photography, the speedy delivery of text and images makes the 
global market a goldmine for you, if you specialize.

THE KEY:  FRAGMENTATION

The fragmentation of information will work in your favor. No longer 
will photobuyers be seeking a picture of a cat. They'll want a White 
Manx or an Abyssinian silver male cat. If you have a way with cats 
and love photographing them, you will become an important resource to 
a book publisher in Singapore who is producing a coffee table book on 
Black Persian cats.

To the rest of us, such photo requests will seem way out in left 
field, much the same as we feel about the arcane selection of shows 
we see listed on cable TV these days. But to you, the specialist in 
cats of the Near East, the photo request will be right down your 
alley. You'll make not only a sale, but a new contact to add to your 
cluster of buyers that you can count on for sales in the years ahead.

THERE'S HOPE

Does the trend toward specialization mean we are coming to a static 
resting place in our development as stock photographers? Bottleneck 
problems result when we acquire massive amounts of information, but 
have no speedy system to process, transmit, or filter it. But, as is 
happening in many of the medical sciences, electronics, and even 
molecular biology (using DNA as its model), our paths along 
specialized routes may all converge into one gigantic ballroom where 
we would capitalize on the quick delivery of information. Inventions 
such as molecular computers may one day be the solution. Locating and 
transmitting pictures will be as quick as turning the page in this 
newsletter. In the meantime, it's all about putting bread on the 
table, and fragmentation is the key.

HIGHWAY HEADLIGHTS

As the I-Way begins to build, keep your eye on the movers and shakers 
who are developing stock photo sites.  As electronic retrieval of 
picture information becomes easier, more and more photobuyers will 
begin to weigh the advantages of looking for their pictures on the 
I-Way.  But don't make the mistake of being a general merchant; 
you're sure to crash.  Instead, choose a specialty areas that you 
enjoy (wild horses couldn't pull you away), and begin developing 
in-depth coverage now.  Photobuyers in your niche of the marketplace 
will come first to you when they discover you have the pictures that 
they need.  -RE

CORBIS -A MONOPOLY?


I hear it over and over, 'Corbis Media is going to take over our 
industry'....at my seminars, on the Net, at conferences, meetings, 
phone calls.

No it's not.

Corbis Media is the proprietor of a large archive of images, yes. But 
a monopoly, it is not. When Corbis Media is at full capacity, it will 
represent perhaps about 1% of the images on this planet. It is no 
more going to put you out of business than your local lending library 
is going to put newspaper, magazine and book publishers out of 
business.

The impact from libraries has been the reverse:  More books are being 
bought today. 10,000 new publishers are signing up for ISBN's (the 
i.d. #'s in the book industry) each year.  Last year there were 
119,000 new titles published and over a million books printed.
There's no such thing as monopoly culture when it comes to 
communicating.

Vast libraries like Corbis, KPX\Sprint, PNI and any future ones that 
may enter the scene are essentially storehouses of generalized 
photos. These Goliaths aren't geared to collect deep files on every 
subject, every topic, every corner of the world.

For that reason, photobuyers will turn to their "specialty shops" - 
you - when they want expertise in a subject and depth of coverage for 
greater choice, to offer their readers exceptional, insightful 
photography - which after all, sells books and magazines. -RE.

TRAVEL NOTES:

Here's the travel photographer's dilemma. You're taking pictures in a 
foreign country. You come across someone whose photo you just have to 
have. You don't speak her language; she doesn't speak yours. You 
can't ask for permission to shoot, or, in case you need it, for her 
to sign a model release. And you don't want to snap away and then 
walk away. Although in the USA this might be considered normal by the 
general public, in some foreign countries it might be considered 
rude. In some cultures, worse than rude.

Here's one solution. Pull out your Polaroid camera. Take a portrait 
shot and give it to the person. Usually, they'll be delighted with 
the gift and happy to have you then photograph them with your 35mm 
camera to your heart's content.

travel photography and writing workshops in New England.  (Box 163, Albany VT

SNAPSHOP:

DAVID BROWNELL
David Brownell was working for the Aspen Ski Corp. back in 1975 when 
he discovered he could turn his photography hobby into a profitable 
business. When ski magazines started buying his photos (and one of 
his shots on a cover) he knew he could compete with the pros.
The magazine work led to assignments (one company sent him to 
Kilimanjaro). Eventually he migrated to the East coast where his 
western style of ski shooting was in great demand. The move was a 
challenge: no more spectacular mountains, crisp blue skies, mild, and 
mild dry weather of the Rockies. "The East is wet, windy and COLD. I 
keep my EOS1N batteries always charged.  My socks and boots are 
always dry -never wet. And for dexterity, I wear Thermax Gloves with 
fingerless bunting gloves (available in hunting and fishing supply 
store) over top. Never use wool gloves; they have a tendency to get 
strands wound up into your film cartridges."

RIGHTS GRABS. The "siege" of the New York Times by freelance writers 
and their organizations (to protect writers' rights to appropriate 
payment) continues to attract attention.
Along parallel lines, a year ago, TIME Inc. announced a policy 
covering freelance photography that included electronic rights issues 
unacceptable to ASMP, PP of A and other photo groups.  The squeaky 
wheel gets the grease.  Some of TIME Inc.'s periodicals began mailing 
new freelance contracts that did not demand electronic rights, and 
promised royalties for electronic use starting in 1998; demanding, 
however, free use until then.  Multi more protests later, the 
magazines have reportedly again revised their contracts, dropping 
CD-ROM's from the electronic use clause and adding small up front 
payments to cover online use until royalties begin.
The American Society of Journalists and Authors (we are members) 
continues to follow the New York Times Rights Grab.  For more

A WEB SITE "HIT" is the terminology marketing people use when they 
refer to a visitor they attract to their Web Site on the Internet. 
The numbers of 'hits' are always large (15,000, 150,000, etc.). The 
numbers are impressive until you realize these aren't sales, or even 
prospects. They're curious people, window shoppers.
Here at PhotoSource International, we've been photographed and 
featured in several major magazines--TIME Magazine (a half page 
photo), POPULAR PHOTOGRAPHY, MONEY, USA TODAY (quarter page photos), 
CHANGING TIMES (on the cover).  Each person that read these articles 
could be considered the same type of 'hit.' This adds up to several 
million 'hits' over the years. Here's where you get the difference 
between advertising and publicity. While this kind of exposure is 
beneficial for the big picture and long term--does it result in sales 
today? Were we able to covert any of the inquiries? Few. Most were 
window shoppers. We've found, for our business, that the best 
advertising is direct marketing, going straight to a qualified 
prospect through the U.S. mail or a carrier service.  -RE

AGENCY NOTES:
ON-LINE IMAGE LIBRARIES:  WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?


A handful of stock agencies and stock photographers have been 
advertising on the Web.  (Transactions have been done by traditional, 
over-the-phone price negotiations followed by manual prepayment 
through credit card, invoicing or purchase orders.)  Last month, I 
mentioned West Stock's introduction of their new World Wide Web site 
called "Muse," which offers a searchable on-line database of digital 
photographs and quick loading of lower and medium resolution images.  
Earlier this year, Index Stock already pioneered on-line transactions 
on CompuServe, a commercial on-line service. Index Stock's on-line 
database, Photos To Go, offers medium-resolution images (about 2 MB) 
for personal and in-house use in the $15 to $20 price range.  
According to Index Stock's Kathy Mullins, "West Stock's Muse site 
appears to be offering high-quality, 'catalog' grade images. In 
contrast, we've kept our Photos To Go images separate from our 
premium line of catalog images."

Muse provides two on-line resolutions for previewing:  A thumbnail 
image and watermarked JPEC image that is about 3.5" x 5" at 72 dpi.  
Images for lease are offered in the 1.1 MB size and the 4.5 MB size, 
which are similar to Kodak PhotoCD's "Base" resolution and "BaseX4" 
resolutions, respectively.  Muse offers "affordable pricing" in five 
categories:  Personal ($8-$15); internal Business Printed, i.e. 
newsletters ($15-$46); external Business Printed, i.e. brochures 
($20-$70); non-resale Electronic, i.e. Web pages or presentations 
($25-$30); and resale Electronic, i.e. interactive CD-ROM software 
($40-$45).

Picture Network International (PNI) has been operating a commercial 
on-line site for about two years.  Besides offering over 350,000 
images from 40 suppliers (mostly stock agencies), their Publishers 
Depot site also offers works of art (from Christies of the UK), 
historical images, illustrations and type fonts.  PNI has been 
securing digital images and electronic-use rights (with contracts 
lasting up to seven years) from many top stock agencies over the past 
two years.  Now they are offering 5-year interactive CD-ROM licenses 
for as low as $40, for production runs under 20,000; and Publishing 
on Demand (under 5,000 copies) for as low as $30 (18 megabyte files 
are $100).  Although PNI does not offer instant transactions like 
West Stock's Muse site, they claim to provide delivery by writeable 
CD-ROM or on-line delivery within 24 hours.

COPYRIGHT:

Can you use elements of a work you do not own if what you produce 
isn't recognizable as derived from the original work?

Copyright does not protect a work's ideas, processes, or systems.  
Anyone is free to copy those elements.  Only the "expression" in a 
work is protected.

However, if protected "expression" elements of a photo are copied and 
then transformed by the copier into something that is not 
recognizable as the original work, technically, this is still 
copyright infringement (because it is an unauthorized exercise of the 
copyright owner's exclusive reproduction right - even if the copy has 
been transformed into something very different.)  In addition, 
transforming the copy to a new and different work may also be an 
infringement of the copyright owner's exclusive right to modify the 
protected work.

Practically speaking, though, it can be both costly and difficult for 
the copyright owner  to prove infringement in this type of case.  
Copyright infringement is generally established in court by proving 
that the defendant's work is "substantially similar" to the 
copyrighted work.  If the copyright owner's work and the defendant's 
work are not similar, the copyright owner will not be able to prove 
infringement unless the defendant actually admits to having copied 
the protected work.

Phd Technology
KEEP IT TO ONE FINGER


There's a marketing truism: "If you want to live with the masses, 
sell to the classes; if you want to live with the classes, sell to 
the masses."  Applying this to camera production, vendors have 
learned that indeed the megabucks are with mass products for the 
general consumer, not the showcase elite products aimed at 
professionals.

As we move into digital delivery of pictures, however, I see 
manufacturers ignoring this time-tested axiom.

In the race to capture the Digital Image Industry (and it must be an 
important one if Apple, Microsoft, Kodak, Fuji, Sony, IBM, and all 
the other brothers have jumped in), I will make a prediction that the 
technology that will win out, will be Phd Technology.  (Phd = Push 
Here Dummy).

Every bell and whistle you add to something makes it more complicated 
for the operator.  When sales dip, manufacturers put their engineers 
to work to simplify, simplify, and make equipment easier to use.  
We've seen this happen in our generation with cameras, automobiles, 
and telephones.

As photographers move onto the I-Way, computer technology will no 
doubt give way to Interactive Video technology, with all the latter's 
one finger 'touch screen' push-button ease of operation.  If you plan 
on providing a service for photobuyers on the I-Way you'll appeal to 
them and win over the competition if your buyers can reach you with 
one finger (digit). -RE

A WORKABLE SYSTEM


We all like to avoid work.  Unfortunately, few endeavors exist that 
don't entail some work.

"Stay out of my darkroom!" the photographer says.  Or, "Stay out of 
my kitchen!" the chef says.  What they are saying to us is, "I've 
developed a routine.  I, alone, understand it.  I know where 
everything is.  If you come in and disturb my routine -- you'll make 
more work for me."

Since the benefits outweigh the drawbacks of most of the activities 
we involve ourselves in -- housekeeping, driving daily to work, child 
rearing, marketing our photo illustrations -- we find ourselves 
attempting to develop a system to get through the nitty gritty tasks 
that contribute to the success of the main endeavor.  A system, once 
we perfect it, eventually becomes a habit.  As the saying goes, "You 
can get used to anything."  Once we form the habit (even the task of 
meeting the rush hour traffic) it eases the pain.  The unpleasantness 
of tasks we must accomplish in order to `get through the day' can 
always be eased by developing a system that works for you.

Some of us "develop" our `systems' by leaving ourselves to the mercy 
of chance.  We let outside pressures ("do it or else") or inside 
pressures ("I am consumed by my desires") take over.  We sometimes 
succeed despite the odds. The burn-out rate associated with this 
approach is high, however.

A system, to be good, has to be tempered.  A very dear friend of 
mine, a German photographer, who introduced me to the camera back in 
1956, was a perfectionist in his photography and his darkroom.  Not 
even his wife was allowed to be present when he was working.  He 
served up a stress-filled life for himself, and his heart attack in 
1975 was not a surprise.  Another friend, a brilliant photographer 
who coached me in photo illustration back in 1964, allowed inner 
pressures to build intolerably and he took his own life in 1981.  A 
system has to be tempered.

Unfortunately, much press is given to the artist with a cataclysmic 
lifestyle whose angst is supposedly the source of his genious. 
Successful artists who have had happy childhoods and create a 
healthful and smooth lifestyle don't make for interesting reading.  
But there are hundreds of chipper and balanced artists out there who 
can serve as role models - and examples of having hammered out their 
own systems for success in living as well as their art.

Because you have been blessed (or plagued!) with the gift of 
creativity, you have the added challenge of working out a system not 
only for your personal family situation, but your life of creativity 
as well.  Over the years, I have observed that the majority of 
artists who survive intact are not those who got there by sheer 
`talent,' or who moved forward mainly on the nervous energy of their 
"burning desire" (both elements are, of course, important) -- but 
rather those who tempered these elements into a manageable lifestyle 
and built a system that worked, for them.

Rohn Engh is Director of PhotoSource International and Publisher of 
PhotoStockNotes.

FOUR CANDIDATES SIGN ON AS PBS GEARS UP FOR NATIONAL ISSUES
CONVENTION

     While PBS is gearing up with publicity and other fanfare for
start of National Issues Convention (NIC) Jan. 18-21 at U. of
Tex.-Austin, only 4 presidential candidates have accepted
invitations to appear to answer questions from NIC participants,
and 2 of them will take part via satellite.  More importantly,
staffers for key Republican candidate Sen. Dole (R-Kan.) have told
press that he won't be attending.  President Clinton, whose
scheduled revolves around completion of budget talks, hasn't made
up his mind whether to attend, and his appearance live or by
satellite likely depends on budget negotiations scheduled to
reconvene Jan. 17.

     Spokeswoman for NIC said Republican hopefuls Lamar Alexander,
Richard Lugar, Steve Forbes and Sen. Gramm (R-Tex.) all have agreed
to answer questions live before group of representatives from
across U.S. who will spend days prior taking part in deliberative
poll -- discussing and studying issues before going to candidates
with their concerns.  Alexander and Gramm will take part via
satellite, spokeswoman said.  She said Sen. Dole hasn't told NIC
that he won't attend and planners still are hopeful they can find
way for him to participate.  NIC planners said discussions also
continue with White House on securing Democratic presence at event. 
James Fishkin, chmn. of govt. dept. at U. of Tex. and NIC exec.
dir., said organizers hope "that all of the candidates  -- both
Democrat and Republican -- will realize the importance of this
opportunity."  He called poll "democracy at work," putting "entire
country in one room for an open dialogue on the subjects that
matter to many of us."

     Staffers at MacNeil-Lehrer Productions, which is producing
convention for air on PBS, have invited other "policymakers" and
"opinion makers" in case Clinton, Dole and others can't attend,
spokeswoman said.  Names of those invited weren't disclosed.  She
said even if originally-planned cast of candidates don't all show
up, NIC participants -- all 600 -- still will get to take part in
nation's first major deliberative poll, which will show what
citizens think about issues as they become more informed about them
through discussions in small groups as well as with candidates and
other opinion shapers.

     Citizen participants, making up representative sample of U.S.,
are scheduled to arrive in Austin Jan. 18 to begin their group
discussions, which will be led by trained moderators provided by
National Issues forum, non-partisan network of citizen
organizations that regularly hold deliberative forums on wide range
of issues.  Discussion guides prepared by Public Agenda and
Kettering Foundation will serve as briefing materials.  All
materials have been reviewed by bipartisan committee of former
govt. officials.

     Discussions with candidates will air live on PBS stations Jan.
20-21.  Jim Lehrer of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer will moderate
broadcasts, which will be simulcast on NPR.  Wrap-up program Jan.
26 will feature highlights and analysis of NIC.  Poll, developed by
Fishkin, will measure participants' attitudes and opinions before
and after NIC to quantify impact of deliberative process,
organizers said.  NIC will focus on 3 broad issue areas:  economy,
state of American family, U.S. role in post-Cold War world.  Final
broadcast Jan. 26 will reveal poll's results.

     NIC is major component of PBS's The Democracy Project, new
multimedia initiative for news and public affairs programming that
will extend beyond election year.  PBS Pres. Ervin Duggan said he
expects NIC will bring "much-needed perspective" to campaign dialog
as well as "launch an exciting year of presidential election
coverage on public television."

WASHINGTON DEBATE NO LONGER ABOUT ZEROING OUT PTV -- DUGGAN

     PASADENA, Cal. -- Public broadcasters are "confident about our
future," and debate in Washington no longer is about "zeroing out"
noncommercial service but how best to continue funding it,
according to PBS Pres. Ervin Duggan.  At TV critics tour, he said
debate turnaround doesn't mean industry has become "complacent or
comfortable" and that PBS is proud of "the often controversial
programming we offer."

     Speaking of PBS accomplishments during 1995, Duggan said it
was "a tumultuous year, a time more exciting than we would want it
to have been."  While commercial stations lost audience, PBS
remained steady, Duggan said, with 81.7% of American homes tuning
to PTV in Oct.  Among successes, Duggan said, were Home Video
Catalog, "a tremendous success" that went to 6 million Americans; 
PBS online, which he said has been "tremendous boost to our
mission";  partnership with Reader's Digest, which will bring PTV
$75 million over next 5 years;  "audience acclaim" received by PBS
programming in general.

     Among concerns, Duggan said, was drop in corporate
underwriting for PTV programming.  Noncommercial TV receives 86% of
its funding from private sources, only 14% from govt., he said.  As
for proposal some stations have made to Congress to let public
stations advertise products, "the objective truth" is that viewers
and large majority of stations don't want it, Duggan said:  "The
last thing the media world needs is one more commercial channel." 
There would be net loss in income if advertising is added because
of drop in corporate and member contributions, he predicted.

     As for future of govt. funding, Duggan said noncommercial
groups have submitted 11 proposals to Congress and he wouldn't pick
out any one measure as favorite.  Among them was proposed tax on
transfer of commercial stations, which Duggan said would be "just
tiny" fraction of total sales price.  National public broadcasting
organizations, including PBS, currently are pushing proposal that
would allow public stations to lease or sell excess advanced TV
spectrum to capitalize multi-billion dollar trust fund that would
replace govt. funding.  While Duggan refused to endorse proposal to
require commercial stations to air 3 hours weekly of educational
children's programming, he praised "courage and determination" of
FCC Chmn. Hundt in bringing issue before public.  In comments to
FCC, PBS had proposed credit for commercial stations that paid for
production of educational children's programming by public
broadcasters.

     On subject of enhanced underwriting for PBS programming,
Duggan said:  "I'm perfectly happy with that.  We do believe that
enhancing the underwriting message is permissible and we know from
our... research that the audience does not object to that."  He
stressed that programming isn't interrupted:  "We have no appeals
to buy [something].  We have no product pitches... It might be
playing fast and loose with reality to say that we are moving
closer to commercializing" with enhanced announcements.

     PBS said it plans more than 100 hours of primetime programming
covering 1996 presidential campaign.  Titled The Democracy Project,
effort will be headed by Ellen Hume, former Washington
correspondent for Wall St. Journal and N.Y. Times.  Among programs
planned is So You Want to Buy a President, scheduled for Jan. 20
broadcast, which PBS expects to be controversial and will
investigate high cost of national campaigns.

     PBS has been looking for programming head since Jennifer
Lawson resigned last spring in midst of management skake-up.  Major
problem in picking successor, Duggan told us, is that people PBS
has interviewed are making more than $700,000 in commercial TV --
much more than PBS is willing to pay.  Kathy Quattrone has been
filling post on acting basis and she was one of many unable to
travel to southern Cal. to meet with critics because of blizzard in
Northeast.  Also unable to get to Pasadena were Peter, Paul and
Mary, who star in PBS program and were scheduled to entertain.  At
closing PTV session last night (Tues.), several TV critics also
hadn't made it to Cal., because of weather.

     PBS announced several new programming ventures at tour,
including new shows on politics, religion, nature.  Among new
programs will be Bill Moyers series of 10 shows on stories in
Bible's Book of Genesis.  During Genesis:  A Living Conversation
with Bill Moyers, Moyers and group of people from various religious
backgrounds will discuss such topics as Adam and Eve and Redemption
and Noah and the Flood.

     PBS also announced new slate of David Attenborough specials
from BBC, led by 10-part series, World of Birds, for air in 1999. 
Third season of David Attenborough's Natural World -- made up of 10
half-hour explorations of volcanoes, piranhas, butterflies, others
-- begins in 1997.  Also that year, PBS will feature 6 new
Attenborough hour-length animal specials featuring wolves, polar
bears, chimpanzees.  Specials will be part of Nova and Nature
series.

     Also promoted at tour was new American Experience episodes,
including 3-hour biography Reagan, produced by WGBH-TV Boston, and
Great Performances presentation of Les Miserables in Concert.  Les
Miserables was recorded last year at Britain's Royal Albert Hall
and is scheduled to air during March pledge drive.

     Opening lunch on first day of TV critics tour in Pasadena Jan.
8 was hosted by PBS, featuring its 4-part miniseries "Savage
Skies," on the weather.  Unfortunately, blizzard out of East Coast
skies meant many of principals who were to appear to answer
reporters' questions were unable to get from N.Y. to Cal.  Series
is being produced by WNET N.Y.-Newark.  It premieres May 6 on PBS,
will be funded by Marsh & McLellen Cos.

     Public stations were up first at tour, and no money problems
for PTV were in evidence as many gifts and meals rivaled in quality
and quantity those given by commercial networks.  For example, each
reporter received 4 T-shirts promoting different PTV programs.

     Duggan took advantage of his appearance at tour to host Jan.
9 dinner in Bel Air for prominent figures in arts and creative
communities.  Among those attending were studio, corporate and
agency executives.  Dinner honored Beverly Sills, chmn. of N.Y.
Lincoln Center who appeared before critics earlier in day.

CPB AWARDS $8.4 MILLION FOR READY TO LEARN INITIATIVES

     CPB, in what it called "one of the most ambitious efforts to
date to harness the power of public television to teach," has
awarded $8.4 million to fund 2 new daily series for children and 2
accompanying weekly series for parents.  Programs, scheduled to
begin airing in 1997, also will include related online, print and
outreach components to get kids ready for school.  Shows, produced
by partnerships of Children's TV Workshop (CTW)-Columbia TriStar TV
Distribution and WGBH-TV Boston-Sirius Thinking, will join PBS-The
Ready to Learn Service (RTL) program lineup.

     Grants mark first time CPB has funded parent-oriented
programming under RTL and first time RTL has targeted parents with
specific shows.  Until now, RTL has included children's mainstays
Sesame St., Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, Barney & Friends, etc.  CPB
Pres. Richard Carlson called funding "a new vision for television,"
adding that it makes sense to give parents how-to TV when one
considers that each child spends average of more than 4,000 hours
in front of TV by time he or she starts kindergarten.  Carolynn
Reid-Wallace, CPB senior vp-education & programming, predicted that
new shows would become "signature shows and service" for RTL.

     CTW/CTTD partnership will use its $4.2-million grant to
jointly develop 40 episodes of Dragon Tales, animated musical show
designed for preschoolers, and 13 episodes of Show and Tell Me,
live-action series that teaches parents and caregivers how to
participate in their children's learning process.  CPB said Dragon
Tales takes place in "magical world of dragons," with characters
Max and his big sister Margarita, whose parents came to U.S. from
Latin America.  Children travel through storybook to Dragon Land
and journey with their friend Blaze and other "lovable dragons." 
CPB said Blaze will ask viewers to sing, whistle, make silly
sounds, laugh, cry, imitate musical instruments, do animal sounds. 
Show & Tell Me, which will have goal of reinforcing lessons in
Dragon Tales and other RTL shows, will feature celebrity guests,
hidden camera segments, people-on-the-street interviews.  CTW and
CTTD also will develop multimedia material to accompany series,
including on-air and radio interstitial programming, magazines,
internet applications.

     WGBH-TV/Sirius partnership also received $4.2 million for
development and production of 40 episodes of daily, half-hour
literacy series Between the Lions for 4-7-year-olds, and related
13-part weekly half-hour series, Kids & How to Grow Them, for
parents and caregivers.  Interactive Internet component also will
be developed.  CPB said Between the Lions is "first new show in
decades" to promote literacy and teach skills beginning readers
need to master.  Series covers reading, writing, listening and
speaking skills.  Main characters are lions Zazzu and Zig who guard
library doors and teach children about reading.  CPB said once
inside library, viewers are transported to "another dimension"
where books come to life.

     Funding for programs is based in part on recently-awarded
$7-million grant from Education Dept.'s National Early Childhood
Institute.  There currently are 44 stations participating in RTL,
which includes up to 9 hours per day of children's programming
daily.  Broadcast service is complemented by educational materials,
workshops, activity guides, books that reinforce programming's
messages.

QED COMMUNICATIONS HIRES FIRM TO LOBBY ON PTV STATION SALES
LEGISLATION

     QED Communications, parent of WQED Pittsburgh, has hired Dutko
& Assoc., Washington lobby firm, to lobby on legislation affecting
sale of public broadcasting station, QED Communications Pres.
George Miles confirmed.  He said public broadcaster hopes to
convince members of Congress and others that public licensees, WQED
sister station WQEX especially, should have option of using
secondary frequencies for commercial purposes.

     WQED doesn't have any specific new plans for secondary
Pittsburgh market station WQEX, and Miles said using it for
commercial purposes is just one avenue QED Communications is
exploring to raise money to escape $12-million debt.  Miles said he
was hired over year ago (PBR July 29/94 p3) to help station find
solutions to its financial difficulties.  He said QED
Communications is looking at possibility of selling its magazine
and/or other intellectual properties to work down debt.

     WQED is working alone "for the most part" to advance
legislation that would give public broadcasters more flexibility
with extra licenses, Miles said.  Other licensees, however,
including group of northern Va. stations headed by Gen. Mgr. Roger
McIntosh, have been working Capitol Hill looking to loosen
restrictions on uses of 2nd market stations.  Miles said lobby
effort is targeting "everyone... I'll even talk to you."  Rep.
Fields (R-Tex.), House Telecom Subcommittee chmn., and Sen.
Pressler (R-S.D.), Senate Commerce Committee chmn., are expected to
draft CPB authorization legislation later this month that could
change way public broadcasters operate.

     While national organizations APTS, PBS, NPR and PRI have
lobbied for bill that would clear way for establishment of trust
fund designed to use leases and sales of excess system advanced TV
(ATV) capacity for financing, some stations have expressed
discomfort with idea of sacrificing their extra licenses for good
of system.  Some, like WQED, have said they believe they should be
free to use these licenses as they see fit to ensure their own
financial stability.  APTS, however, has said that its plan is only
one that would ensure PTV's continued universal availability and
that most stations, although uncertain at outset, have agreed to
support their plan.  Under national organizations' plan, only one
station in each market would make transition to ATV, and other
stations' frequencies would be leased or sold (yet to be
determined) to capitalize trust fund, which also would fund public
radio.

     Stations lobbying on own for legislation that would allow more
commercial enterprises, including advertising and sales/leases of
secondary stations, got boost recently when House Telecom
Subcommittee Chmn. Fields (R-Tex.) told public broadcasting
representatives that he was considering "several ideas," and not
just one, to ensure continued funding for public broadcasting (PBR
Dec 29 p1).  He said he was doubtful public broadcasters would be
able to capitalize $4-billion trust fund through ATV leases/sales
alone.  Fields said if up to him, public broadcasters would have to
follow same rules as commercial counterparts, meaning they would
have to return NTSC spectrum soon after receiving ATV frequencies
and might have to participate in ATV spectrum auctions.  Fields'
staffers in recent months have indicated he is more open to
legislation that would allow stations to experiment with
revenue-raising ventures, including more commercial enterprises, as
long as funds raised are used to further public broadcasting
mission.

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on
budget and telecom bills said recently that staff-level
negotiations had rejected White House proposal for broadcasters'
early return of analog spectrum in exchange for digital spectrum. 
Sources said no deal had been reached on spectrum issues as
high-level talks continued at White House.  They also said that
there would be "no giveaways" to broadcasters as part of final
budget deal.  Statement supported assertion by Senate Majority
Leader Dole (R-Kan.), who was reported by Reuters as objecting to
what he called "giveaway" of spectrum to broadcasters.  Rep. Fields
(R-Tex.), House Telecom Subcommittee chmn., said recently that if
commercial broadcasters must bid in auctions for advanced TV (ATV)
spectrum, then so should public broadcasters.  He also said public
broadcasters wouldn't get any breaks -- if commercial TV stations
have to trade analog spectrum for digital, so should they.  Public
broadcasters have based their trust fund plan on having both analog
and digital spectrum for some time and on having flexibility on
when to switch to digital.  Most public broadcasters would have
difficulty funding equipment needed for ATV transition, and all but
largest producing stations probably would have trouble finding
money to take part in spectrum auctions.  Meanwhile, sources said
some published estimates of value of analog spectrum to be given
back after conversion of broadcasting services to digital have been
wildly exaggerated.  While some reports have put value of spectrum
as high as $70 billion, sources said figure is more in neighborhood
of $6 billion.  That amount, they said, wouldn't reflect costs to
society of having industry and consumers convert to new
technologies before either is ready.  Negotiators also rejected
White House proposal for $1-billion subsidy to consumers to help
them adjust to conversion through purchase of set-top boxes. 
Forcing consumers and industry in short term to use technology that
market hasn't found to be ready could short-circuit development of
ATV, Hill sources said, adding that FCC has wide discretion to
determine whether ATV licenses should be awarded and what
conditions should be attached, including disposition of analog
spectrum.

income, CPB report said, up from 22.4% year earlier.  State govt.
contributions "varied greatly" from state to state, ranging from
zero to $23 million for PTV and zero to more than $3.6 million for
public radio.  Ga. gave more money, $30.4 million, to public

Televisa, Azteca vie for viewers and ads as Mexican cable services take root

Playing host to a horde of new cable and satellite services carving out
their piece of the Latin American pie, Mexico's 12.5 million TV homes are
enjoying the fruits of competition.

TV already accounts for roughly 65% of total ad expenditure in Mexico, and
with a TV ad market forecast to grow by 15% in 1994 to $2.3 billion P as
large as Spain's P there would appear to be enough room to support the two
networks' ambitions as well as the new satellite arrivals.

Three months into its re-launch, Mexico's commercial network newcomer TV
Azteca is doing its best to give the reigning commercial giant Televisa a
run for its money.

Having secured the ailing state-owned TV network for $640 million last
summer, chairman Ricardo Salinas Pliego is out to put TV Azteca's national
networks 7 and 13 on the map.

Settling into its role as spoiler, Azteca recently re-jigged its program
lineup with a mix of U.S. imports and popular soaps. Azteca currently
produces 70% of its own material.

While Televisa commands 80% of Mexican audiences, Azteca's first major
challenge will be to attack Televisa's advertising dominance. Long
attacked for monopolistic practices, Televisa has for years attracted
major advertisers with its Plan Amigo. A variation on the
four-for-the-price-of-one French Plan, which necessitates buying a year's
worth of ads the pervious fall, Plan Amigo offers bonuses in exchange for
ad exclusivity. Televisa is under investigation by Mexico's Federal
Commission for Competition. Televisa reportedly stopped the Plan Amigo
last fall, but its agreements with major advertisers are guarded secrets.

Company boss Ricardo Salinas maintains that advertisers with TV Azteca are
reaching more people for their money. Comparing the revamped network's top
soap Marielena with Televisa's concurrent nightly newscast, 24 Horas, an
independent source showed a cost per rating point of $590 versus $1200
under Televisa's discount scheme. Launched a month ago, Marielena has
achieved a rating of 10.3% in Mexico City, compared with 16.2% for 24
Horas. Top Azteca shows thus offer 40 to 62% savings to advertisers.

Last November, Televisa subsequently pushed back the popular news show by
half an hour to 22:30. Tacitly admitting Marielena's success, Televisa
reasoned that at 22:00, viewers of the flagship Channel 2 would be less
likely to change to a Telemundo-produced soap if the popular half-hour
soap, Corazon Salvaje (formerly at 21:30) was still to come on Channel 2.

Azteca's other late evening soap, El Penon del Amaranto is not faring as
well. Early ratings after Azteca's October re-launch showed only 3.3% of
Mexico City homes watching P less than half the audience of Marielena
(8.1) and less than 10% of the rating of rival Televisa's 21:00 Valentina
(36.5). One of Azteca's top draws last year was La Cosa which airs Sunday
(22:00), attracting 13.8% of Mexico City homes, based on November figures,
compared with only 7.3% for Televisa's music show Noche de Valores on
Channel 2. And it's not just a battle among the terrestrial networks.
Conceding a lack of mass-appeal local product, an army of library-driven
channels rely on both premium and free-to-air American fare to lure
viewing in the 12.8% of homes with cable.

Against popular local shows on the terrestrial networks, the new satellite
service, Fox Latin America, is slotting its prime feature film fare as
well as drama series L.A. Law at 22:00. The satellite channel's top titles
in December included Home Alone, Come See the Paradise and Working Trash.

The new cable programmers concede that the Latin countries are very much
"developing" ones, and that subscription fees that will initially comprise
the bulk of revenues will be low. Fox, Tele-Uno and a slew of other
budding cable channels will increasingly compete for ad revenues to
support their admittedly risky ventures. Yet the pan-Latin American
advertising market remains relatively untested.

"Four years ago there were virtually no dedicated Mexican cable services;
today you can count 35 Spanish language channels available to cable
franchises...it's very competitive," says Ernesto Vargas, vice president
of MSO Multichannel and a partner in pan-Latin channels Tele-Uno and Cine
Canal. Vargas hopes to introduce a new, dedicated Mexican programming
channel by 1995. Tele-Uno, the 24-hour U.S. series channel which draws on
the big Worldvision catalog, is distributed via satellite throughout Latin
America, along with other entertainment newcomers, TNT Latin America, Cine
Canal, Gems TV, HBO Ole, and Cine Latino, which this month extends its
native Spanish service to the rest of Central America.

"Mexican product is clearly the most popular, the dominance of
[Televisa-owned] Channel 2 is proof of this," says Vargas. "Nevertheless,
Tele-Uno provides a good option. American comedy doesn't travel that well:
it's action and suspense that plays best after local shows," he says.
Vargas says Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place and The Heights are the
channel's most successful shows. According to Worldvision VP Bert Cohen,
such shows create an audience awareness which may cross over to its
back-catalog classic series.

Counterprogramming is key for the niche channels. "Multivision looks at
what we have in our catalog and tells us how to use it effectively," says
Cohen. r

RTL-5 struggles to secure up-market niche

Dutch fledgling commercial station RTL-5 has denied that  its schedule
revamp this month, increasing prime time documentary output, is a direct
result of its failure to attract the more affluent, higher educated
viewer, although its audience is youthful, as originally planned.

Bert van der Veer, program manager for RTL-5 and RTL-4 said the current
programming schedule evolved out of a need to get the station up and
running quickly.

"We realized even before we started broadcasting with RTL-5 that there
were programs in the schedule that should be replaced as soon as possible.
We are trying to deliver an alternative and we will try to devote more
time to that aim. Don't forget, it took the UK's Channel 4 ten years to
get it right." Other innovations include an increase in news output with a
30-minute bulletin at 20:00 and sports news at 22:00.

RTL-5 has not yet reached its 10% share target. Thanks to an exceptional
football match on October 13 (which got a 31.8 rating), the channel's
share peaked during its second week at 11.8% and decrease to and
stabilized at just under 6% since (see chart).

Overall RTL-5's programming strategy looks like a half-success: though
RTL-5 has cannibalized its sister station RTL-4, the two CLT services now
take a higher combined share than the latter did alone previously. Apart
from RTL-4, the three public state channels of NOS and the cable stations
have seen a marginal erosion of their shares by RTL-5.

The mother of all quotas?

The French parliament has decided that the education channel to launch by
the end of 1994 should carry 100% French material. Although this may
contradict European treaties, it is debatable whether French producers
have enough quality programs in stock to supply the channel. For instance,
in France itself the general opinion is that the best available TV French
language courses are those of the BBC.

UK kids like TNT-Cartoon Network.

In cable and satellite homes, for the week ending November 28, the Turner
twin stations took a 5.7% share among children aged 4 to 13, ahead of The
Children's Channel (2.6%).

Nickelodeon, which was introduced at the same time as TNT-Cartoon last
September, has been slower to break through, claiming with a meager 1.5%
share. The fact that TNT-Cartoon is free-to-air rather than part of the
Sky pay package, has clearly helped its cause.

In Spain, Tele 5's mix of game shows, action films and variety programs

In Spain, Tele 5's mix of game shows, action films and variety programs
has been derided as "tele-basura" or television garbage byJthe critics,
but Tele 5's lowest common denominator approach has nonetheless produced
healthy ratings. Now industry insiders areJsaying that Antena 3's recent
surge in the ratings may force the stationJto re-think its strategy.

In October, Antena 3 once again bumped Tele 5 out of the number two spot.
The revamped Antena 3 invested millions in contracting big stars and
produced a number of its own situation comedies that have been huge hits
in Spain and Latin America.

Tele 5 is still feuding with Sofres, Spain's audienceJmeasuring service,
and refuses to acknowledge Sofres reports putting Antena 3 ahead, despite
an independent audit confirming Sofres' data.

A spokesman for Tele5 says there are noJmajor programming changes planned.
Drastic changes could be premature as AntenaJ3 growth has come primarily
at the expense of TVE 1 and Spain's other public stations, while Tele 5
audience share has held steady at around 21%.

But industry insiders say that Tele 5 may haveJto re-group if Antena 3
continues its surge. Following Antena 3's lead, Tele 5 will have five new
series in production during the coming year.

Italian animation rises

Thanks to data supplied by Carat, RAP produces a series of indices on
European advertising. For each of five markets, the index refers to gross
TV revenue in the latest month available compared to a year earlier. The
RAP composite index estimates European TV ad revenue during the last
twelve months compared to 1992. Together, the five countries represent
over 75% of the total European market. Spain is excluded because high
discount levels make monthly expenditure estimates unreliable.

Italy airs well over 2,000 hours of animated programming a year, but local
producers are only responsible for a fraction of the output. Children's
programming, and animation in particular, has increased steadily over the
last five years, though the domestic production sector does not look to
share in the spoils.

Speaking at a recent conference of Italian animation producers, Alfio
Bastiancich, secretary of the Associazione Italiana Film di Animazione said
Italian producers account for only 3% of animated broadcasts on the public and
commercial channels.

Still blessed with "favored growing market" status among program
prospectors, the Asia-Pacific region promises double digit growth in TV
advertising in 1994.

Aggregate TV ad spend across the 14-country region only accounted for .85%
of GDP in 1992 (.23% in China), but 1993 witnessed a 10.6% increase in
overall advertising. With per capita GDPs on the rise, and an increasing
number of channel choices, the region is hungry for product as
opportunities for barter syndication grow. Politics permitting, China may
be on the fastest growth of all, with 9% GDP growth forecast for 1994 and
1993 TV ad expenditure of $662 million, expanding by 45% in 1994.

The Spanish government's adoption of the EU "Television Without Frontiers"
legislation has sent Spain's television stations scrambling to discuss
future ad rates now that advertising will be reduced.

After the Spanish government agreed to mandate a minimum of 20 minutes
between commercial breaks, senior Spanish TV officials held a preliminary
meeting to establish new rates with less discounting. Even though rates
will likely go up, many ad agencies are pleased as currently commercials
get lost in frequent, lengthy breaks.

EU directive:  A blessing in disguise?

While French producers enjoyed their moment in the world political and
economic spotlight last month, it turns out part of their fortress was
more a Trojan Horse.

The main target of U.S. negotiators at the GATT talks on the TV front was
the EU's 1989 "Television Without Frontiers" directive which requires that
European originated programming comprise the majority of broadcasters'
schedules. But in fact the finer print of the directive may harbor a
silver lining for U.S. distributors and new channels.

To back its ban of TNT-Cartoon Network on cable last September, the French
government claimed it was only acting to uphold the directive. But,
according to an undisclosed legal opinion last summer by the European
Commission, it seems Brussels takes a radically different view of the
underlying issue. The paper, obtained by French broadcast researcher
Jean-Pierre Jezequel, is the text of the EC ruling banning TF1 from
creating a split of its service aimed at Belgian audiences. In an article
to appear in the monthly Angle Droit, Jezequel points out that the ruling
supports all the claims of Turner against the French government.
Specifically, the Commission's interpretation of European law says:

The directive forbids "all controls on broadcast services coming from
another member-state, a fortiori any kind of licensing requirements;"
however, the French have been insisting that each channel seeking
distribution in France get a CSA 'convention.'

If a broadcast service respects the regulation of its country of origin,
it need not be re-licensed elsewhere.

Furthermore, to clarify the directive, the Commission cites article 59 of
the Treaty of Rome (about the free flow of services through the EU), which
grants no special 'cultural' status to television.

If Turner decided to sue the French government and the CSA, it would have
its view supported by Brussels, concludes Mr. Jezequel. The only legal
avenue left for the French to stop Turner would be to sue the UK in the
European Court to force it to apply the directive. But here the law must
give way to politics. Thus the directive, widely criticized by U.S. rights
owners, could be a strong help to U.S. channels trying to penetrate the
European market. The 50% quota is restricted by the mention "when
practicable" and does not even apply to a whole range of programming such
as news, music and sports. Provided they find a host state, one could
argue that the new channels have a legal protection against other foreign
governments in Europe stronger than anywhere else in the world. r

Have shows, will travel

Cheap and cheerful game show formats continue to draw high marks across
multiple markets. Having conquered the margins of European TV schedules,
U.S. formats adapt to new territories.

Quota-resilient and economically sound, the ever-ready game show is
enjoying a renaissance on the world's airwaves. But beyond the fanfare,
glitz and prize money lurks a solid market vehicle: game shows are cheap
to produce, draw solid early evening viewing shares and can be readily
adapted to almost any culture.

Abiding by the programmers axiom that 'local plays best,' game show
formats have carved an enviable place in international TV trade. Game show
vendors are confident that their shows are the only geographically
transparent TV formats. TV bargain hunters learned early-on the value of
unlimited supply, long runs and audience loyalty. Game shows also offer an
ideal platform for sponsorship and barter.

Most frequently "co-produced" or rather "adapted," game shows are unique
among U.S. derived product in that they are rarely exported in their
original form. Beyond their ability to secure the daytime or traditional
housewife viewer, game shows' true value lies in its local adaptability.

For young, cash-strapped networks, game shows are a stalwart of the
schedule, both mornings, late afternoons and sometimes even prime time. As
much as 10% of some schedules are devoted to some form of audience
participation quiz shows and glamor games.

In the U.S., familiar game shows have been around for two generations and
remain popular. The new syndicated 30-minute version of The Price is
Right, a show originally launched three decades ago, proving that the
format is is one of TV's enduring classics. When those shows were
introduced to European audiences in the wake of 1980s TV deregulation,
pundits said such crass commercial exports could never repeat their home
grown successes and that their novel popularity would fade.

But they proved wrong. As in the U.S., game shows have established
themselves as Europe's most constant genre. In Spain, Italy, France and
Germany the Wheel of Fortune, Price is Right and Pyramid are now solid
rating busters for the dominant channels, scheduled mostly in late morning
or early evening slots.

But not just any game will play. The formula may seem simple to produce,
but getting the chemistry right is not easy, which is largely why U.S.
formats dominate long running games (5-7 episodes per week). Fremantle
International has foreign production subsidiaries in the UK, Spain,
Canada, Portugal, Greece, Australia, and Turkey and controls over 50% of
global game show distribution.

Owned 80% by The Interpublic group, Fremantle also is well-positioned to
exploit cash plus barter arrangements with international product groups
and clients such as Unilever. Thanks to barter, Fremantle has launched no
fewer than nine shows in fast-deregulating Turkey during the last two
years. Similar approaches are on tap for central and eastern European
markets.

"Nobody can re-invent the wheel," says Fremantle president and CEO Paul
Talbot who maintains that the basic types of games were invented in the
1950s in the United States. This view is shared by Michael and Roger King
of syndicator King World, which distributes only two game shows, Jeopardy
and The Wheel of Fortune, and admitted recently that they have looked in
vain for similarly strong product. King World has sold its two shows in
all major markets, often with Fremantle as a producer, since Talbot has
secured production rights for both shows across western Europe. Fremantle
International has 64 game shows running in 17 countries.

Europe's commercial networks tend to stick with proven formats, but
producers are anxious to develop their own shows. According to a program
database compiled by French consultancy INA, most shows are adaptations.
But European networks do experiment with new game concepts often based on
board games, but few survive more than a season, and almost none manages
to sell across borders. One of the few examples of a successful long
running home grown show is Des Chiffres et des Lettres, a word and
mathematics game broadcast on France 2 since the 1970s, and now
reformatted with some success by Channel 4 in the UK, VTM in Belgium and
La2 in Spain. According to France 2, the show has even recently aroused
some interest from U.S. buyers. Game shows could easily find themselves at
the forefront of new interactive TV capabilities. With Twentieth Century
Fox's upcoming multi-million dollar adventure game format Scavengers, the
game show will meet "techno-reality" drama. With a set in London,
Scavengers' European co-production partners will shoot their own versions
out of the same production facility. European producers have more success
with 'near game show' formats. These "entertainment" shows usually run on
a weekly basis, and are a mix of music, dance or even sports contests.
Such quasi-game shows are the way of the future and are a distinctly
European modification of the genre. One of the few successful purveyors of
European produced game show formats, French producer Jacques Antoine has
created 'adventure game shows,' expensive 90-minute monthly programs which
often feature sports contests in exotic places. Among his most recent
products, Fort Boyard has penetrated Scandinavia, where the show is
modified to local tastes although it is actually shot in France. But
Antoine has yet to come up with a five-days-a-week competitor to the U.S.
shows.

The economics of game shows are simple. The price broadcasters pay for a
show in the major markets depends largely on its potential audience; thus,
a show for an access slot is more expensive than one for daytime. In
France, industry sources reveal that TF1 used to pay up to $26,000 per
episode for its access shows (which it moved in 1992 to daytime) and pays
now up to $22,000. Shows on rival France 2 aired at lunch time are
estimated at up to $20,000.

Broadcasters' revenue for the same shows can vary considerably. Wheel of
Fortune, on TF1 at 11:50 a.m., carries a single break from which it
grosses about $60,000, on top of the show's two sponsorship contributions
(estimated at $20,000). The Price is Right can gross over $200,000 per
day. In Germany, according to data supplied by the advertising agency
Saatchi & Saatchi, in 1992 the Wheel of Fortune on average grossed
$600,000 per episode, in part due to its 19:20 time slot.

Game shows offer considerable financing and scheduling flexibility. In
Spain, where TV ad regulations are lax, there are few curbs on product
placement or sponsorship. Contestants' desks can be huge soap boxes with
the brand name displayed continuously, something unthinkable elsewhere in
Europe. Program duration can also be changed. Due to popularity with
advertisers, The Price is Right on Canale 5 in Italy, which started as a
half-hour program, was extended to one hour and even to two hours, before
settling back to one hour.

France Television has been running 90-minute prime time specials of its
two Grundy shows, Everybody's Equal and Going For Gold, which regularly
top the ratings of their respective channels, France 2 and 3. The latest
special on France 3 lifted the channel's share to 24%, above its average
of 15%. Fremantle typically acts as domestic producer of its shows
operating through a local production subsidiary. Last year the company
opened a game "factory" near Cologne in Germany and has subsidiaries in
seven other countries outside the U.S. Where there is no local corporate
affiliate, Fremantle acts as co-producer with a broadcaster or local
production company and takes up 40-70% of the profits, according to
outside estimates.

Most recently, Fremantle has extended its Latin American operations,
concluding a co-production deal with Brazil's TV Bandeirantes for
Supermarket Sweep and $25,000 Pyramid. Fremantle also inked deals for
local versions of Let's Make a Deal and Swap Meet, with Ecuador's
Ecuavisa. The only places where shows are sold in their original format
are very small markets. Grundy, the only would-be global rival to
Fremantle, is the producer of all its shows, though sometimes with a local
partner.

Paul Guilbert, who oversees foreign licensees' production of King World
distributed shows, insists on close control over such local versions.
Typically, major deviations from the guidelines only occur after
considerable argument with the original producers/distributors.

Despite the dominance of Fremantle and King World formats circulating in most
major markets, there remains considerable room for growth. The emerging
syndication market and new cable services are hungry for product.

Game shows are not suitable for every channel. "Second tier"
entertainment-led stations such as M6 in France and Pro 7 in Germany and
RTL 5 in Holland have avoided game shows, counterprogramming late
afternoon time slots to garner the valuable young adult or urban
demographic, often with U.S. series and sit-coms. But other relatively
small stations do carry game shows, like Sky One in the UK. In France,
TMC, a national cable and satellite service, has just introduced an
original format, Vitamime, produced by Canal+'s Ellipse.

Some mainline European networks are reluctant to overload their schedules
with "down market" stripped game shows. ITV scheduling executive David
Brenan, points out that, apart from the channel's traditional weekday game
show at 9.30 a.m., his quiz shows tend to appear once a week and to get
renewed regularly. "We look for new ideas all the time," says Brenan,
"usually, foreign formats would be proposed to the network through
independent UK producers."r

U.S. stripped formats dominate

In Germany, the vast majority of game shows are on the two leading private
stations RTL and SAT1 (although the number one, Dating Game, is on public
channel ARD) and all the daily shows within the top ten are produced by
Fremantle's German subsidiary. Strassenflirt is more of an entertainment
show than a quiz show. 5 Mal 5 is an adaptation from a Dutch word game
developed by IDTV and public broadcaster Vara where male and female teams
face each other. Few games, but prime time slots

The UK's ITV strips only one game show, Fremantle's Supermarket Sweep, in
mid morning, a traditional game show slot in which the ITV frequently
rotates game titles. This is one reason why The Price is Right (which was
doing well) and Wheel of Fortune (which did not do well) have been dropped
by ITV after a few seasons. The Channel 4 and BBC game shows tend to
emphasize knowledge contests, such as in Countdown, a France 2 format, or
Going for Gold from Grundy.

The game-variety cocktail

Italians have a penchant for long shows mixing interviews, music and game
sequences, of which Il Grande Gioco is a perfect example This genre can
easily be used either in access or in prime time. Canale 5, part of the
Fininvest group, devotes the highest proportion of its schedule to game
shows in Europe, behind Spain's Tele 5 (also part of the Fininvest group).
Canale 5 also strips most of its game shows, while public Rai channels
tend to carry weekly shows, the exception being Venti e Venti on Raidue
where viewers play a word game through the phone.

NewsrapI Viva, the first German music channel, launched on Christmas eve

NewsrapI Viva, the first German music channel, launched on Christmas eve
in 18 million homes. On top of the expected diet of pop music videos (50%
of them domestic), Viva carries reports on the environment, education,
sports and leisure activities, plus music news. Some regional regulatory
bodies have expressed concerns over the possible use of the channel by its
shareholders, four major music publishers, as a promotion tool.

The channel faces a tough battle in a market where MTV Europe is already
active. To increase its ad sales in Germany, MTV has launched a new
satellite feed allowing commercials in German to be fed to its 12 million
cable homes there.

Prices paid by the French channels for feature films can vary widely.
According to a report in Ecran Total, a French trade weekly, the rights to
La Soupe aux choux for different periods were bought for FFr1.5 million by
La Cinq, FFr180,000 by France 2, and FFr1 million by M6. The top prices
were paid by TF1 at Ffr8 million for hits such as L'Ours or Indiana Jones.
Canal+, as a pay service, can spend 50% more for top rated films.

Germany's RTL Television has ordered a third series of 230 episodes of
Gute Zeiten, Schlechte Zeiten (Bad Times, Good Times) from Grundy/Ufa TV
Productions. The soap is an adaptation of a format originally developed in
Australia as The Restless Years ten years ago, and first introduced in
Europe as a Dutch series for RTL-4. In Germany, the afternoon soap
recorded its best rating ever with 7.3 (5 million viewers) on October 18.

AsiaNet, the 20-year old American Asian programming service, is launching
a UK cable version. It competes head on with existing UK services
Asiavision and Namaste.

Loft, Argentina's Canal 13's new talk and variety show, has generated
higher press coverage than ratings. All 17 episodes were shot expensively
in Miami to get an original feel that would suit the eccentric host, Nico
Repetto, but Canal 13 was expecting Loft would get more than the 800,000
viewers it averaged last fall.

TV says ad clutter is not a problem. According to research sponsored by
the British network, the presence of program trailers in advertising
breaks has no significant consequence on viewing behavior for terrestrial
channels. Moreover, viewers seem to appreciate them. However, when they go
over five minutes, viewers tend to switch channels. Researchers also found
that viewers are twice as likely to zap away during end credits than
during trailers. As a result ITV is to ask producers to reduce credits.

No second advertising break will be allowed during fiction programs, under
the French broadcasting bill introduced last month. This hurts M6 which
relies heavily on TV movies in prime time.

Blazing its own trail in Asia, Grundy International Distribution recently
concluded its first program deal in China, selling police drama series
Bellamy to regional broadcaster Shanghai TV (STV). Grundy earlier
completed a multi million dollar deal with Hong Kong's Star TV for the
popular Australian soap, Neighbours.

Paradise Beach the half hour teenage series was moved to prime time for
the Australian summer season on its home channel, Nine Network.
Distributed by New World International, the show launched on TRT in Turkey
in December and should be introduced in Germany by RTL in March, taking to
14 the number of countries where it is broadcast.

Grundy Worldwide and Telepictures Production (a Time Warner subsidiary)
are to produce for BBC1 a British version of the U.S. factual
entertainment series How'd They Do That, broadcast on CBS in 1993. The
show should be scheduled this winter.

TF1 introduced on December 20 Les Filles (The Girls) at 18.30, moving the
successful Helene et les Garcons to 18.00, while Premiers Baisers is
suspended, but should return later on. These daily sitcoms, plus Le Miel

episode had 6.0 million viewers and a 22.7% share.

Gaumont Television's Highlander series has been doing fairly well on TF1
and Italia Uno since introduced last fall. In France, on Wednesdays at
13.30, the show's rating for December 8 was 13.4 with a 44% share. In
Italy, Highlander was on Sunday evenings at 20.40 and raised Italia Uno's
share in the slot from 10% to 13%. On the U.S. syndication market
Highlander averages a 4.2 rating.

SeaQuest DSV is to launch on RTL on January 19. The pilot did well on ITV
on October 16 with a 15.4 rating, the highest viewing figure in the UK for

Fiction programming continues to make inroads onto European prime time. It

Fiction programming continues to make inroads onto European prime time. It
is no surprise that domestic shows take top ratings. In import-wary
France, TV movie L'instit, allowed France 2 to beat its close rival TF1
for the month's top show.

Feature films occupy the upper echelons of U.S. rankings, and are by far
the most important U.S. genre in prime time in Europe. U.S. series are
typically scheduled before or after viewing peaks, except on the second
tier commercial stations like Pro7, M6 or Channel 4, which do not generate
high enough ratings to figure in those top tens.

In Germany ZDF 's Wetten Das...?, a mix of debates and contests, maintains
its position as the country's top rated show in October. A French
adaptation failed on TF1 last winter, but the format could still be
considered for other territories.

In Sydney (Australians ratings are only available on a market-by-market
basis) U.S. sitcom Home Improvement is having a strong run on the Seven
Network. Created by the same team that produced Roseanne and The Cosby
Show, two of the top rated U.S. series worldwide, it could expect an
equally strong international run.

In the UK, Coronation Street has been topping the ratings for years and it
is one of the main assets of its producer, Granada Television. In revenue
and audience share, Germany remains the most fluid market. RTL 2 has
confirmed its success against all the other "small" cable channels it is
competing with. The big loser is VOX which announced budget cuts and
redundancies in December.

On October 13 soccer matches took place around Europe for qualification to
the 1994 World Cup. The games made it into the top 10s in each European
market, but the qualifying round is now over and interest will be lower
until the finals next summer.

Channel 4: UK maverick re-writes program rules

Channel 4 occupies a unique position among Europe's and even the world's
commercial channels. By law, a "self-governing statutory corporation,"
Channel 4 programs an eclectic variety of both high-brow documentaries and
innovative drama, which are largely financed by the ratings success of
unabashedly commercial U.S. imports.

The channel has carved a niche for itself in the UK, and is confident that
its programming mix will be resilient in a fast-expanding, competitive
multichannel marketplace.

Albeit a mandated "minority broadcaster" -- it must devote its airtime to
alternative programming, a range of artistic, political or otherwise
"challenging" formats and genres -- Channel 4's annual revenues are 100%
commercial. With annual ad revenue of #306 million ($456 million, 1993
estimates) Britain's fourth terrestrial service is a strong magnet for the
upmarket viewer who would otherwise be tuned to ad-free BBC2.

Far from letting its quasi-governmental status keep its programming
strategy rooted in didactic fare, Channel 4, a primary patron of the
independent production sector, has taken the offensive, and come away with
sizable gains in numerous time periods.

On January 1 Channel 4 celebrated its first year unleashed from its foster
parents, the ITV network. The ten year old channel now sells its own ad
time and buys its own programming separate from the ITV network center:
the result is a clear ratings and advertising success.

"Basically, the audience we get with American programs allows us to
develop innovative, non-mainstream shows," says Caroline Thomson, head of
corporate affairs at Channel 4.

The channel actually airs the largest percentage of U.S. material on UK
terrestrial TV. Much of it is cult, such as off-beat theatrical films, as
well as the higher end of available U.S. drama and comedy, including NYPD
Blue, which makes its winter schedule debut and is intended to bolster
Channel 4's admittedly weak Saturday evening.

Last fall, Channel 4 scored its highest marks with the domestic soap
"Brookside," delivering a total of 6.16 million viewers (w/e Nov 28) for
its highest rated episode (each of the three episodes is screened twice a
week).

Overall, Channel 4 ran 2,037 hours of acquired programs in 1992, 48% of
which were first run. Although non-feature U.S. shows accounted for only
41% of total airtime devoted to acquisitions, their cost represented 52%
of the #14.5 million spent. On top of this figure, #8.9 million was spent
on acquired feature films (the channel also produces about ten films of
its own every year).

Although acquisitions represented 45% of the 1992 schedule, they accounted
for only 12% of the total programming expenses of #200 million. Resisting
pressure to go downmarket for the maximum share, Channel 4 remains
faithful to its remit. There is a safety net, however: a sophisticated
arrangement set up by the 1990 Broadcasting Act requires cross-subsidies
with ITV if Channel 4's share of ad revenue falls or rises too much.

Provided the channel maintains an audience share at or over 9%, its
current program orientation won't likely be questioned. Thanks to the rise
in the station's market share and an overall acceleration in UK TV
advertising expenditure growth (see page 1), Channel 4 saw a handsome
windfall in revenues which grew by an estimated 22% in 1993 to #306
million. After a drop to #184 million in 1993, the program budget should
be back to its 1992 level of #200 million in 1994.

According to Thomson, this should allow a little breathing space for
production budgets, which had been squeezed by the recession. U.S. shows
should remain relatively inexpensive, as competition with the BBC and ITV
is marginal. "A U.S. series cannot keep its slot on ITV with six million
viewers, while it's a hit on Channel 4 with four million," Thomson says.

The growth of satellite service Sky One has somewhat inflated prices, but
the two channels rarely go head-to-head in programming. Sky mainstays such
as Star Trek and Beverly Hills 90210 would not be suitable for Channel 4
according to Thomson.

Perhaps Channel 4's greatest coup has been the huge success of its
renegade, youth-oriented morning show, The Big Breakfast. Introduced in
October 1992, the show has drawn large chunks of audience away from
struggling GMTV, the new ITV morning licensee. In September 1992, Channel
4's 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. audience share was 4%, in November 1993 it had jumped
to 30% while ITV's had slipped from 53% to 43%. In the younger age groups
the show has even a bigger lead. Alone, The Big Breakfast is responsible
for 20% of the channel's ad sales. The fast-paced, irreverent show is
indicative of Channel 4's role as innovator in the UK marketplace.

ONLINE GAMBLING HITS THE WEB
Is Internet Casinos' Cyberspace Venture
A Crapshoot for Internet Commerce?

      Internet Casinos Inc. soon will be stretching
the bounds of the Internet, and in the process raising
serious questions about how federal and state gambling
and tax laws apply to cyberspace.

      From a casino based in the Dutch Caribbean
island of St. Martin, the company plans to launch an
online gambling hall, styled after traditional
casinos, on the Web in mid-May.  The site will offer
keno, blackjack, roulette, backgammon, animated horse
racing, more than 30 different slot machines and a
variety of other games of chance.

      The regulatory quandary is that the online
community will play with - and win - real money.
Internet Casinos will require players to send a
minimum of $50 to the offshore casino, and the online
gambler then will receive an account and password for
gambling.  Winnings then can be wired back to the
player within 48 hours, or can be deposited back into
the offshore account to earn interest and serve as
holdings for future gaming.

      While it may sound like a dubious proposition
that few would attempt blind, about 1,500 online users
have preregistered for the site since it first went up
a week ago, said Internet Casinos President Warren
Eugene.

      "We feel that the 'net community is capable of
looking after themselves," Eugene said.  "This is a
First Amendment issue."

      The casino's virtual doors will open May 15, but
no money will be accepted until one week before the
launch, Eugene said.  The company already has $1.2
million to bankroll the Web casino, with a $1 million
line of credit available, he said.  To keep the casino
fluid until it builds a solid cash reserve, bets are
kept to a $500 maximum, although the minimum goes as
low as 5 cents for the slot machines.

      Payment can be made by Visa, MasterCard and
cashier's check, Eugene said, adding that the company
is in discussions with both DigiCash BV and CyberCash
Inc. about adding their online payment capabilities.

New Dimension Because of Location

      While issues of local control in cyberspace have
been raised before, most notably when states try to
prosecute the placement of pornography online, the
Internet Casinos venture raises questions of law and
tax liability because of its location outside this
country.

      Online gambling networks such as the systems
being marketed by subsidiaries of Interactive Network
Inc. and NTN Communications Inc. are restricted by
laws in different states that govern what types of
betting can be conducted from the home or designated
locations.  Because Internet Casinos is located
outside the United States, at-home wagering laws and
age restrictions technically may not apply to the Web
site.  "We're being very cautious about not violating
international laws," Eugene said.

      The odds of this system going online without
challenges are slim, since there is no way for the
company to monitor the age of potential gamblers and
many state governments have retained tight
restrictions on gambling.  But there may not be much
that the federal or state governments can do to
prevent the online gambling.

FBI to Make Statement on Online Gambling

      The Federal Bureau of Investigation soon will
make an announcement relating to online gambling
issues, and would not comment for this article until
after the announcement is made.

      Aside from state concerns over gambling, the
federal government also has a stake in this type of
offshore venture.  Gambling revenues are taxable
income, but if cyber-winnings from Internet Casinos
can be kept in the foreign bank, the government may
have a difficult time taxing these funds.

      Eugene insists the venture is legitimate, and he
is publishing the algorithms and codes used for the
games for users to verify the slots are not "rigged."
Interactive Casinos will spot-check the system to
ensure it is not tampered with, he said.

      Internet Casinos can be reached at (416)
444-8835.

OPEN MARKET TO RELEASE COMPETITOR TO NETSCAPE
Will Use Multiple Security Schemes

      Open Market Inc. made multiple moves to
re-establish itself in the quickly crowding market for
Internet commerce solutions, announcing a host of new
software products and services and a relationship with
First Union Corp. to bring its customers onto the
Internet.

      Among the new products is a secure World Wide
Web server aimed at supplanting Netscape
Communications Corp.'s early lead in providing the
basis tools to companies that want to sell on the Web.

Moving Into Service-Oriented Business

      The broad suite of products launches Open Market
out of its first phase, which consisted of hosting
information vendors in an online marketplace, into a
new service- and tool-oriented business.  At the
center of this business is the Open Market Secure
WebServer product that distinguishes itself from
Netscape's Netsite Commerce Server and Spry Inc.'s
forthcoming SafetyWeb by supporting the two leading
security protocols - Netscape's Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) and the secure hypertext transfer protocol
(S-HTTP) supported by most other Web developers - in
one package, giving it maximum possible exposure to
Web users.

      Netscape has taken an early lead by establishing
its Navigator Web browser as the largest in use.  But
even with a current estimated 77 percent of the
browser market, Netscape has no guarantee it will
continue to dominate.  As quickly as it took the lead,
it could be supplanted by a newer, niftier product.

      The majority of other Web browser makers are
licensees of Spyglass Inc., (the master licensor for
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
[NCSA], which developed Mosaic) and Spyglass is firmly
behind S-HTTP.

      Although Netsite will build S-HTTP into future
versions of its secure products (REC, March 7, p. 1)
the time frame for integration is uncertain.  Open
Market, by supporting both standards, suddenly looks
like the server of choice for companies that want to
do business now with the whole Web and not wait to see
what Netscape does.  Although Open Market will license
SSL from Netscape, terms of the arrangement were not
available.  Netscape has stated that it intends to
offer the technology to all comers for a one-time
licensing fee.

      The release of tools is directed at larger
companies with  established brands who don't want an
intermediary between themselves and their
audience/customers.  One of the first adopters of
Secure WebServer is Time Inc., which is migrating its
popular Pathfinder Web site to Open Market's software.
Time plans to begin charging for subscriptions to its
online magazines and services in the next few months.

      "These new products allow companies to do
business over the World Wide Web on their own terms,"
said Shikhar Ghosh, chief executive of Open Market.
"They support electronic commerce in a way that
transcends mere transactions by supporting ongoing
customer relationships and the creation of brand
identity."

      Other adopters of Open Market's server include
Lexis-Nexis and the Copyright Clearance Center.  Both
companies are using the software for Lexis-Nexis'
Information Marketplace project to sell copyrighted
material over the Internet while ensuring that holders
of intellectual property receive full compensation for
their work.

Rebuilt Server Technology From Ground Up

      Like Netscape, Open Market says it has rebuilt
the server technology from the ground up.  The company
claims both faster performance and support for as many
as 1,000 simultaneous users.

      "The Open Market WebServers are not derivatives
of freeware server implementations," Robert
Weinberger, Open Market's vice president of marketing,
said.  "They have been architected from scratch to
achieve the highest levels of performance,
functionality and interoperability."

      This is especially important as security gaps
and faults are turning up in the HTTP implementations
available as freeware from NCSA and CERN, the European
Laboratory for Particle Physics.  The Computer
Emergency Response Team, the quasi-public Internet
security patrol that tracks developing problems with
the network's integrity and keeps records of attacks
on sites, issued a warning in February that sections
of the public domain server software are inherently
insecure and could allow malevolent  hackers access to
a company's entire system through the Web server
holes.

Secure Link to Transaction System

      Unlike Netscape, however, Open Market also will
market a full system to enable transactions, including
a back office connection to a transaction network to
process credit card charges.  The separate module,
called the Commerce Connection, establishes a secure
link to Open Market's existing transaction system to
process orders in real time.  Open Market also will
provide billing services if necessary.

      In an agreement with First Union Corp., the
server software will be used to host an online mall
for as many of the bank's 35,000 merchant accounts as
choose to develop an online presence.  First Union
also will try to encourage its account holders to use
the system to access their account information and
will move quickly to get every department in the
Richmond, Va., bank to use the Internet to reach and
service customers.

      The Secure WebServer will be demonstrated
publicly at the Internet World trade show in San Jose,
Calif., April 10-13 and should be available
commercially by the end of April.

      It will sell for $4,995, but carry a mandatory
annual service charge of $1,995.  Commerce Connection
will retail for $2,495 and also carry an annual
service charge of $1,995.  Open Market is selling an
unsecure version of its WebServer for $1,495.
Security can be added to that product using a $3,995
Security Module.

CompuServe BUYS SPRY FOR $100M
Everyone Has A Browser; What Next?

By Nate Zelnick
Associate Editor

      Now that CompuServe Inc. and Spry Inc. have
agreed to tie the knot - with the online service
paying a hefty $100 million dowry for its new mate -
links between the top consumer online services and the
World Wide Web are nearing completion.  All that
remains is dealing with the hangover after the
cheerful reception and, of course, paying all the
bills.

      One particularly knotty question is how the
online services will deal with secure access to Web
sites that plan to sell goods and services through
secure connections with consumers.  CompuServe
Information Services' (CIS) customers will use Spry
technology, which supports only the secure hypertext
transfer protocol (S-HTTP), while Prodigy Services Co.
and Delphi Internet Services Inc. have licensed
Netscape Communications Corp.'s technology and - in
the short term - will use Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
only.

      The number of users coming in from the consumer
online services likely will double the total number of
Web-capable users in the United States alone.  While
server and browser makers are moving quickly to expand
their secure transactions offering to all available
customers on all platforms, the consumer online
companies have had to recast themselves to match the
pace of technical innovation on the Internet.

Adding 'Access' Like Jumping on Train

      The primary problem is that Internet
applications such as the Web are not static features
that can be added to an existing system; adding
"access" to it is like trying to board a moving train.
Web software developers are struggling to upgrade the
presentation and application interfaces of servers and
browsers.  Netscape's proprietary extensions, which
add everything from the silly and annoying "blink"
feature that flashes lines of text on a page to the
long-needed image adjustments that allow developers to
wrap text around a picture or present text in columns,
are a contentious issue for other developers who
resent Netscape's moves to add to hypertext markup
language (HTML) without first consulting the standards
bodies.

      In the face of this problem, CompuServe's
decision to buy Spry - even at what seems an extremely
high premium - makes good business sense.  Compared to
America Online Inc.'s $35 million purchase of
BookLink, an untested company with only one product
(which never was tested in the market), Spry's price
was a bargain.

      CompuServe and Spry are a match made in heaven.
CompuServe is buying a fully operational company with
lots of products in the marketplace and consistent
black ink on its balance sheets.  Privately held Spry
generated $16 million in revenue last year and, based
on annualized projections of first-quarter earnings,
was expected to make more than $40 million this year.

      Even more important is the ever-elusive synergy
so often cited in mergers and acquisitions.  In this
case it may be real.  Spry and CompuServe both have
impressive credentials in the corporate arena.  Not
only is CompuServe the business favorite because of
the rich databases of CIS, but its Network Services
division provides private dial-up facilities for Visa
International Inc.'s network and other big businesses.

      Spry's AIR series of transmission control
protocols/Internet protocols (TCP/IP) connectivity
tools and the recently released Internet Office suite
of internetwork applications are corporate favorites
for building private and public Internet links.  The
company also launched an aggressive plan to market its
turnkey Internet access software packages, Internet in
a Box and Mosaic in a Box, to corporations wishing to
use the Web as a communications medium to reach their
customer base.  General Electric Co.'s plastics
division was the first big company on board (REC, Dec.
13, 1994, p. 9).

      Spry President David Pool - who personally will
pocket between $20 million and $30 million in the
purchase of the privately held company - told REC in
December that Spry planned to develop deals with all
comers.

      "We want to ship a disk with every refrigerator
so that  customers can just pop it into their
computers and reach the manufacturer's Web site," he
said.  Under the original plan, Spry would pay a
bounty for every customer a third-party company
brought onto the Internet using Spry software.  Pool
said the company plans to continue this venture using
CompuServe's network as the primary carrier.

      The use of the network will be the key
competitive change in Spry's business.  In the initial
release of Internet in a Box, Sprint Corp.'s
SprintLink network was the primary carrier and charged
an exorbitant $8 per hour to connect to Spry's wholly
owned access provider InterServ (although users could
connect to any point-to-point protocol [PPP)
provider).  Pricing for the network connections will
be announced April 11 at Internet World in San Jose,
Calif.

      Spry also brings to the table its other
"affiliated companies," Free Range Media and NovX,
both of which were brought back into the company last
month.  Free Range provides Web authoring services and
design consultation for companies developing
commercial sites.  NovX develops and sells
pre-configured server computers.

      Spry has sold more than 200,000 copies of
Internet in a Box to consumers through book and
computer stores.

CHANGE AT INTERACTIVE GIFT
MAY SIGNAL STRONG PATENT STAND

      Interactive Gift Express Inc. (IGE) named a
corporate turnaround specialist its new chairman and
president, a move that may be a precursor to the
company taking a stronger stand on its patent
affecting electronic commerce applications.

      Arnold Freilich takes the president's helm from
Robert Cosby, who came on board at IGE last December
around the same time the company acquired what is
known as the "Freeny patent."

      The patent covers "the transfer of digital
information to a material object at the point of
sale," and, if enforced, it theoretically covers the
use of debit cards in certain situations, sales
through bulletin board services, and the digital
transmission of software from a central site to remote
locations for recopying and sale.  This type of system
is being developed by IBM Corp. and Hughes Network
Systems Inc. using DirecPC satellite technology.

Resignation Only Part of the Shake-up

      Cosby's resignation was just part of the
shake-up in the company's upper echelons.  Company
founder Clarence Jolley stepped down as chairman of
the board but retains a spot as director, while his
two sons, Layne and Wayne, have resigned from the
board.  Michael Franzese, Arthur Casey Stern III and
Grant Robertson also joined the board, bringing the
number of directors to five.

      Although Freilich characterized Cosby's
resignation as amicable, the new president admitted
Cosby was not geared toward IGE's interactive business
plan.  IGE's core business has been its wire-based
gift delivery service, but the company plans to move
quickly into the multimedia market, Freilich told REC.
Part of IGE's new business will be branching into
kiosk-based touch-screen gift ordering, along with
bringing their traditional paper-based catalog online.

      IGE is looking at a variety of online service
providers, including America Online Inc., for porting
the gift catalog online, Freilich said.  The company
has not ruled out venturing onto the Web or into
Internet malls, however.  With both the kiosk and
online ordering services still in the planning stages,
IGE plans to take its first steps into the interactive
market through licensing and litigation.

      IGE has stated its intention to license the
Freeny patent, and litigate against possible
infringers.  The company recently brought in David
Fink, former senior vice president of patent
exploitation firm Refac Inc., to head its licensing
effort.  IGE also completed a private placement of
convertible notes to finance this campaign.

      While the Freeny patent has the potential to
generate millions of dollars in fees, IGE needs the
voluntary licensing from at least one large company to
legitimize its claim.  Enforcing broad interactive
patents can be a costly proposition if IGE is forced
to take all infringers to court.  Also, in the new
realm of digital commerce and communications, broadly
worded multimedia patents are finding it difficult to
stand up before the courts and the government, as
evidenced by the rejection of Compton's New Media's
patent on multimedia navigation that was shot down
last year by a patent review board.

      Although the company is keeping a tight rein on
its patent, it will be very selective in terms of
which companies it will go after, Freilich said.
"We're not afraid to go to court, but we're not going
to say this patent covers the world," he said.

      IGE reportedly was in discussions with IBM Corp.
and Bank of America, but Freilich would not comment on
any of the company's negotiations.  Aside from his
role on the board, Franzese is a full-time consultant
to Bank of America.  According to Freilich, IGE is
very close to licensing its technology to a
"noteworthy" client, and expects to announce this
arrangement within three to six months.

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SET TO COVER E-MAIL
IN COMPLEX NEW FRAUD REGULATIONS
Cumbersome Rules May Well Hamper Electronic Commerce

By Michael F. Cavanagh
Contributing Editor

      On Capitol Hill there is a strong wind blowing
against onerous federal regulation, but down the
street a few blocks at the Federal Trade Commission,
sweeping new rules are evolving rapidly - rules that
would rewrite a substantial part of direct marketing
law and put cyberspace under a complex new regulatory
scheme.  (Unlike a proposed bill in Congress, which
must move through the often arduous legislative
process, federal regulations need only be approved by
the agency proposing such rules after public comment,
and thus there is a certainty of action.)

      What the FTC is doing, in a nutshell, is taking
myriad issues relating to telemarketing abuse and
squeezing them into an opportunity to regulate
electronic mail, online services and cyberspace in
general.  These rules are targeted at business
dealings with "consumers," not most
business-to-business transactions, but the nature of
the requirements could make the distinction between
consumers and business employees almost meaningless.

Acting in Response to Telemarketing Act

      To be sure, the FTC is acting in response to the
Telemarketing Act of 1994, signed into law last August
to fight deceptive (and also highly annoying)
practices employed by some telemarketers.  Congress
directed the FTC to establish a set of specific
regulations to fight the estimated $40 billion per
year that is lost by consumers as a result of
telemarketing fraud.

      The law defines telemarketing as any plan,
program or campaign conducted to induce payment for
goods or services via the telephone.  The FTC states
in its Federal Register notice announcing the proposed
rules, however, that it has made "one addition" that
"clarifies" the definition.  The FTC adds "the use of
a facsimile machine, computer modem, or any other
telephonic medium" to the definition of telemarketing.
Thus, e-mail suddenly is at the heart of a complex set
of new rules and regulations.

      Experts on the issue told REC last week that the
"addition" is remarkable in that Congress had no
intention of dealing with computer communications in
this legislation.

      According to noted analyst John Awerdick, an
attorney in Newark, N.J., who is representing several
major companies in this proceeding:  "It's clear that
the Congress was aiming the legislation at plain
vanilla telemarketing fraud."  The  problem, said
Awerdick, is that "while there shouldn't be deceptive
advertising in any medium, the time and nature of
disclosures to the consumer may need to differ" based
on what medium is used.

      Washington attorney Allan Adler, who will be
filing comments with the FTC on behalf of the Direct
Marketing Association, said that "instead of focusing
on the scam artists that led Congress to enact the
legislation, these [FTC] drafters regulate the entire
broad spectrum of telephone use, portraying  it as
inherently risky."  The telephone has been around for
a long time, Adler said, and "one can now only imagine
how the FTC plans to treat cyberspace [now that it is
to be covered under their regulations.]"

What Do Regulations Require?

      What specifically do these regulations require
from anyone who makes over 10 "sales" of anything
annually via the telephone, fax and e-mail combined?
(This is the new definition of "telemarketer.")  The
long list includes strikingly different disclosures
and practices, depending on whether or not the sale
involves office equipment, cleaning goods, a
charitable  contribution, any prizes, equity in a
business.  The list goes on and on.

      As a fairly general matter, these proposed
regulations require that "before payment is requested
for goods and services offered" the seller must list
all terms and material restrictions, cancellation
policies, exchange and refund options, etc.  Detailed
records now must be kept, listing all solicitation
activities for a 24-month period.

Complete List is Long One

      To detail the complete list of regulations with
which telemarketers must comply would take virtually
this entire issue of REC.  While many of the
provisions are quite benign and do seek to target real
fraud patterns, virtually anyone involved in
electronic commerce will need to know what they are.
More precisely, they probably will need to have a
lawyer close at hand when anything that could be
construed as marketing takes place.

      As previously noted, there is an important
exemption to these regulations, but one that is
particularly problematic for the electronic mail
industry.

      These regulations exempt most (but not all)
business-to-business solicitations.  Given that,
what's the problem?  Think about it.  In an
extraordinarily high number of situations in the
e-mail world, it's impossible to determine whether or
not the e-mail address listed is a personal or
business mailbox, or indeed whether the person uses
that mailbox for personal as well as  business use.
(Below you will find an e-mail address for this
writer.  Is it a business or personal address?  Do you
want to risk prosecution by a state attorney general
in order to find out?)  Similarly, the use of many fax
machines blurs with respect to whether it is business
or personal.

      In light of the vast array of new issues raised
by coverage of e-mail, is it possible that the FTC has
added "modem" communications inadvertently to this
proposal?

      Quite the contrary, as it turns out.  Several
times in the notice respondents (anyone who comments
on a proposal) are asked to address whether or not the
definitions are "sufficiently broad to encompass
current as well as future technology."  In  fact, it
appears clear that the FTC views this telemarketing
rulemaking as its entrance into cyberspace regulation
and that the commission wants to be sure that its
definition covers everything imaginable.

      In sum, the Federal Trade Commission is poised
to actively enter cyberspace and begin the regulation
of all electronic commerce.  Most reasonable people
would say that consumers do deserve protection from
fraudulent operators,  regardless of what mechanism
they use to perpetrate their deceptions, including
electronic mail.

Frustration at Attempts to Overreach

      On the other hand, it also might be appropriate
to suggest that the backlash against government rules
and regulations demonstrated recently at the ballot
box probably manifested an American frustration with
regulators' attempts to overreach logical bounds when
expanding rules designed for one purpose into areas
that have not been examined adequately.

      There still is time to have your organization
comment on these proposed regulations.  The full text
of the proposed regulations are found in the Federal
Register of Feb. 14, 1995, on pages 8313 through 8333.
Formal comments must be submitted to the FTC by March
31.  (Full instructions can be  found in the Federal
Register notice.)

FOLIO AND PARTNERS OFFER INFO
COMMERCE, COPYRIGHT PROTECTION
API Provides Reimbursement Scheme

      Folio Corp. and a group partners are offering a
technology package designed to meter digital
information usage over wide area networks in support
of electronic publishing on the Internet and
commercial online services.

      If this metering system becomes standard, which
is a goal of the partnership, information in private
databases may leave the privilege of the business
world and become affordable to the home user for the
first time.

      Folio, along with Novell Corp., the Copyright
Clearing Center (CCC) and several information metering
systems makers announced March 6 an application
programming interface (API), server software and
secure links to a transaction system that will provide
a reimbursement system for use of copyrighted material
sold on the Internet or other wide area networks such
as Novell and AT&T Corp.'s AT&T Netware Connect.  The
Folio metering API is the key component of a system
called the Information Marketplace proffered by the
company and its partners, which also include Wave
Systems Corp. and CD-Max Inc.

      Folio, of Provo, Utah, recently was bought by
Reed-Elsevier PLC, which also owns the Lexis-Nexis
databases for legal and news information.

      The system is designed for publishers who want
to offer electronic access to their data, but are
afraid that going digital means losing control of
their materials.  Currently, these newsletter,
newspaper and database publishers have had to use
high-priced proprietary systems such as Dialog
Information Services Inc. and Lexis-Nexis, which limit
their potential audience to institutional researchers
and tie them to clunky interfaces on proprietary
networks.

      With internetworking growing faster than any
previous communications medium in history, the
opportunities for content providers are huge, as are
the risks.

      Folio's InfoBase technology has been a popular
way to distribute material on disk or CD-ROM.  The
Information Marketplace moves that model into the
wider world of internetworks such as the Internet,
although it also can be used on proprietary or
commercial networks.

      "The Folio API is a logical extension to our
existing Rights Management technology which today
allows publishers to restrict usage of infobases on
CD-ROM by the number of users, or for a specified
period of time," said Tracy Scott, president of Folio
Corp.  "Now we can extend those capabilities to meter
information on a per-transaction basis, which will
allow users to only pay for what they use.  This will
open up new markets for publishers in cases where
their information has been prohibitively expensive or
otherwise impractical for use by small companies and
others who, for one reason or another, do not
currently buy subscription-based information
products."

A la Carte Charging Solves Problems

      The ability to charge users on an a la carte
basis over the Internet solves several problems.
First, by offering discrete segments of data,
companies can price their products lower, which allows
them to expand their markets.  A la carte also allows
information to be priced according to its intrinsic
value, instead of valued generically by subscription.
A longer feature or study printed in REC, for
instance, can be priced differently from a round of
news briefs.

      The CCC partnership will allow companies that
adopt the Folio metering API to link into the right's
database of more than 1.7 million publications.
Through that link, and with access controls provided
by companies such as Wave Systems, Infobase Systems
Inc. and CD-MAX (each of which has announced support
for the API) users can be positively identified, their
access limited to areas for which they have rights and
their use of products tracked for billing.  Connection
to the CCC enables the holders of copyrights to be
compensated based upon the specific content accessed.

      "In most cases, traditional print publishers and
authors have been unwilling to release their
copyrighted materials in digital form without adequate
protection of their copyrights," said Joseph S. Alen,
president and chief executive officer at CCC.  "By
providing both technological and contractual controls,
the Folio/CCC relationship promises to dramatically
increase the flow of digital information from rights
holders to users."

      For Web-based applications, Folio is using a
secure server technology developed with Open Market
Inc. (see story, p. 3).  The product is in beta
testing now and is expected to be commercially
available by early summer for $6,995.  The Folio Web
Server will provide links to the CCC's database and a
separate system to be developed to provide clearance
for intellectual property not handled by the CCC.
Secure links also will be provided to a third-party
billing service that will process transactions, but
not track the exact materials accessed to ensure
anonymity of research performed over the network.

Wave Systems Designed Encryption Chip

      Wave Systems already has designed an encryption
chip around the Folio metering API, and has licensed
it to VLSI Technology Inc. to manufacture the chips.
Aside from electronic commerce applications, Wave
Systems may use the technology to create rental or
pay-per-view business models with the database
material, said Amelia Burkhart, Wave Systems
spokeswoman.  Wave Systems is working on applications
that will meter data usage and cut off access after
set periods of time, she said.

      Initial metering API-compliant products will be
released this year to meter local area networks and
CD-ROM, with wide area network and Internet capability
planned for late this year and 1996.  Wave Systems
plans to have its private network chips ready by
spring, with Internet and Web versions ready by the
end of the year, according to Burkhart.

      Although prices haven't been set, Wave Systems
expects its chip to sell in the $100 range.  While
home users may not buy the chips as an add-on, Wave is
working on bundling arrangements with computer
companies, peripheral manufacturers and publishing
companies, Burkhart said.

      Folio can be reached at (801) 229-6331; CCC at
(508) 750-8400; and Wave at (413) 274-1400.

MEDIO MULTIMEDIA MOVES
INTO ONLINE MARKETPLACE

      Medio Multimedia Inc. is approaching advertisers
about electronic commerce opportunities available with
the company's forthcoming hybrid CD-ROM magazine to be
launched in June that will include links to the new
MedioNet Internet access service.

      Medio has held discussions with Dewars scotch,
which already advertises on the regular CD-ROM
magazine, and has approached retailers such as
Nordstrom, Macy's and Nike about selling products in
an online marketplace being developed by the company,
said John Rutter, Medio senior vice president of sales
and marketing.  The online mall is likely to be
available by August or September, he said.

MedioNet Will Cost $9.95 First 2 Months

      MedioNet, slated for a national launch later
this year, will be priced at $9.95 for the first two
months and $19.95 for the following months.  The price
tag includes a copy of the CD-ROM magazine to provide
the software link, and 40 hours of Internet access.
Medio launched a pilot Internet access network in
Seattle, Wash., that eventually will use the company's
CD-ROM magazine as the front-end to reach the
Internet.

      This pricing model doubles the Internet time of
online service Delphi Internet Service Corp. - $20 for
20 hours - and gives Medio a dual revenue stream.  The
company will collect its basic Internet access
charges, along with money from advertising on the
CD-ROM magazine.  Linking MedioNet with the CD-ROM
also boosts the subscriber base for the magazine,
which commonly is used to determine pricing structure
for advertising.  The magazine also is sold
individually through retail channels.

Modem Speeds Up to 28.8 Kbps

      MedioNet will support modem speeds up to 28.8
kilobits per second, and is working with U.S. Robotics
Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., Cisco Systems Inc.,
Sprint Corp., NorthWestNet, Structured Communications
Systems Inc. and Teleport Communications Group to
provide the infrastructure for the Seattle system.

      Medio is well positioned to create a
multimedia-rich online market, because
memory-intensive audio and video clips can be stored
on the company's CD-ROM for immediate access, leaving
the online connection free to transmit information
updates and ordering commands quickly.

      The actual ordering component will not include
online credit card transactions in its initial
rollout, Rutter said.  Medio takes credit card orders
for its CD-ROM magazine over the phone, and these
numbers will be used by the company to collect payment
for online orders when the system is in place.
Eventually, Medio wants to move to online credit card
orders, perhaps using an in-house system for secure
payment, Rutter said.  But it is more likely the
company will license a "name brand" secure transaction
technology from another party, he added, which will
make consumers more comfortable ordering over
MedioNet.

      With the CD-ROM magazine becoming the front-end
for MedioNet, the company is working to boost the
disk's circulation before the service extends
nationally this summer.  This week, Creative Labs
ordered 100,000 copies of next month's magazine to
send to its customers that register their multimedia
upgrade kits, Rutter said.  This registration
incentive boosts Medio's circulation to 150,000.
Rutter expects Creative to order a similar amount
every quarter.   Medio can be reached at (206)
450-9965.

BAXTER IMPLEMENTING CD-ROM
WITH EDI PURCHASING CAPABILITY

      Hybrid CD-ROM catalogs with online connections
for ordering are becoming commonplace, as 2Market Inc.
and Interactive Catalog Corp. bring consumer and
business-to-business solutions into cyberspace.

      But the system that health care supply giant
Baxter International Inc. is implementing puts an even
newer spin on CD-ROM-based electronic commerce -
Baxter is using electronic data interchange (EDI)
technology over proprietary networks as the
transmission medium instead of the Internet or one of
the online services.

      This week, Baxter announced it was replacing its
old Analytical Systems Automated Purchasing (ASAP)
hospital procurement system in favor of the OnCall*EDI
system developed by TSI International Ltd.  Baxter
will phase out its ASAP support by the end of 1996.

Transition Forces Hospitals' Transition

      Baxter's transition to OnCall*EDI all but forces
most of the 6,000 hospitals using the DOS-based ASAP
to make the transition to the open x.12 standard TSI
is marketing.  Baxter's health care division provides
medical supplies to more than 4,000 of the country's
estimated 6,600 hospitals, according to Bob Bouton,
TSI vice president of marketing.

      Using a CD-ROM version of Baxter's Source 2000
catalog created by Automated Catalog Services L.P.,
hospitals can search through images and text of 80,000
hospital products and place the EDI order right from
the disk.  The TSI system is windows-based, and
hospitals can zoom in on product images along with
ordering by pointing and clicking.

      The two-way connection allows Baxter to provide
immediate price updates to the disk, and speeds up the
procurement process for the hospital.  Down the road,
an automatic payment system will be built into
OnCall*EDI, allowing hospitals to link their
purchasing with accounting systems for immediate
verification and delivery of funds, Bouton said.

      "CD-ROM catalogs in a lot of ways offer benefits
over online catalogs," said Torrey Byles, director of
electronic commerce for market research firm BIS
Strategic Decisions.  "This type of system is very
quickly going to become widely used in other areas."

      TSI already has shipped a few hundred OnCall*EDI
platforms to Baxter, which is reselling the units to
hospitals it services, and Bouton expects hundreds of
further orders to come through in the next six to nine
months.

      Moving away from the proprietary ASAP system
also will benefit Baxter's competitors, which will be
able to tap into the OnCall*EDI system with their
CD-ROM product catalogs.  Aside from manufacturing its
own brand, Baxter also distributes competing products
from other companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, and
the new ordering system will provide a more level
playing field for manufacturers that want to target
hospitals directly.

      Baxter can be reached at (708) 689-5009; TSI at
(203) 761-8600; ACS at (610) 687-7500; and BIS at

INDUSTRY.NET HEADS TO THE WEB
Manufacturers Enter Information Age

      After existing as a direct dial-up information
service for the manufacturing community, Industry.Net
moved to the World Wide Web to advertise its wares in
its electronic marketplace.

      The Industry.Net Online Marketplace allows
manufacturers to place product and price information
online for industry buyers to browse and collect
information.  About 3,300 companies promote products
on the service.  They pay between $450 a month and
$40,000 per year for the privilege, depending on the
size of the electronic display and how many regions of
the country the companies want to reach, Industry.Net
spokeswoman Autumn Jones said.

100,000 'Buying Members' Use Service

      About 100,000 "buying members" access the
service to examine products from "selling members"
such as IBM Corp., Rockwell, Honeywell and Alan
Bradley.  In addition to product information, the
service includes industry news briefs, discussion
groups and electronic mail to send questions to
companies displaying their products.

      Although the new Web service is strictly
informational, within three months Industry.Net will
add the capability to conduct online purchasing, Jones
said.  It still is undetermined whether ordering will
involve receiving a purchase order number for later
billing by regular mail, or will allow credit card
orders to be transmitted over the Web.  Industry.Net
uses servers from Netscape Communications Corp., which
would allow for an easy switch to Netscape's secure
commerce technology.

      After watching the information revolution taking
place throughout the corporate world, the
manufacturing community slowing is beginning to take
notice of the potential for electronic commerce to
facilitate purchasing and other business-to-business
transactions.

      At National Manufacturing Week's Design Show
last week, the spot where Industry.Net premiered the
Web service was the only booth with a connection to
the Internet, Jones said.  But the low-tech days of
manufacturing communication may be coming to an end.

      Aside from online markets such as Industry.Net,
CD-ROM catalogs also are becoming a popular method to
convey parts catalogs and price information to buyers
and other vendors (see story, p. 12).

      While CD-ROMs allow for snappier multimedia
presentations, online trading floors have the
advantage of immediate ordering and price updating.
Industry.Net's Web site has been running as a trial
for about a month and has received about 60,000
logons, Jones said.  The company projects more than 1
million logons by the end of the year.

FEUD BETWEEN IN, NTN WINDS DOWN

      While the feud may not be over yet, the battle
between the Hatfields and the McCoys of the
interactive television gaming world finally may be
winding down.  Interactive Network Inc. (IN) and NTN
Communications Inc. announced an out-of-court
settlement March 6, ending at least part of a
decadelong dispute over technology allowing home users
to play games and win prizes from set-top boxes,
personal computers and gaming systems.

      Although terms of the settlement were not
disclosed by either party, the arrangement is
basically an "I'll go one way, you go another" deal,
in which neither side will sanction the other's
products.  As representatives from both parties
stated, no licenses changed hands.

      The two companies have been locked in disputes
over IN's interactive gaming patent.  Although a 1987
settlement gave NTN a worldwide, royalty-free license
on the technology, the company wanted to introduce
evidence that the patent actually was taken from
technology developed at NTN originally.  IN denied the
claim, and a court ruled last November NTN could not
sue because of the terms of the 1987 settlement.  This
latest settlement puts to rest questions on whether
IN's "IN The Huddle" football game infringes on NTN's
proprietary "QB1" football game.

      Although the companies still are in dispute on
other areas of the patent, IN now will offer "IN The
Huddle" to its 5,500 network users in its five test
markets.  With this legal hurdle out of the way, IN is
hoping to raise money to continue its market trials,
said Dave Lockton, IN chairman and chief executive
officer.  The football dispute "put a cloud over us in
the financial community," Lockton said, expressing
hope that the remaining issues with NTN can be worked
out in a similar arrangement.

      IN can be reached at (408) 325-5016, and NTN at
(619) 438-7400.

AMERICAN AIRLINES PLANS
ELECTRONIC IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT

      American Airlines Inc. will conduct a six-month
test starting this summer of an in-flight
entertainment system that gives passengers access to
movies and electronic games on flights between the
United States and Europe.

      Passengers will operate the system through a
handset at each seat.  The airline is remodeling its
fleet of 41 Boeing 767-300s and installing digital
telephones compatible with the systems.  The handset
also will operate the phone, and a phone jack at each
seat will allow a passenger to send faxes from
portable computers.

      The service will be available in all classes of
service.  However, first-class passengers will use
video units mounted on the arms of their seats while
other passengers will use monitors on the seat backs
in front of them.

NEW 2MARKET CD-ROM DUE EARLY MAY

      2Market Inc., the interactive CD-ROM shopping
service owned by America Online Inc. (AOL), will issue
its second disc in early May, according to Michael J.
Minigan, vice president for business development.

      The golden master of the disc will be delivered
to the manufacturer in the first week of May, with
shipments occurring shortly thereafter, Minigan told
REC.  For now, the service, which also is available on
AOL, is scheduled to be updated twice a year.

      The disc will contain fewer than 26 catalogs,
the number that appeared in the premiere issue, he
said, but each catalog will contain more information.
The change is due, in part, to market research
following on the release of the first disc last year.

      "People wanted fewer catalogs but more
merchandise from each," he said, declining to name the
new catalogs that will be added to the service.
Current offerings include Crutchfield, Land's End, The
Learning Company, The Nature Company, The Sharper
Image and Sony Music.

      Other improvements in 2Market's next issue will
be a simpler method of ordering merchandise over a
modem, Minigan said.  "If we make it even easier to
use, we've got a grand slam," he said.

MovieFone EXPLORING KIOSK,
ONLINE TICKET SALES

      With 67 percent growth in its 1994 revenues,
MovieFone Inc. is looking beyond its traditional
phone-based information service to kiosk and online
models this year.

      MovieFone revenues totaled $22.6 million in
1994, up from $13.5 million the year before.  At the
same time, the company's losses were cut to $1.9
million from $2.2 million in 1993.

      MovieFone is riding into profitability on the
back of a national expansion campaign.  In 1994, the
company received 33.3 million calls to its service,
which provides updated information on where movies are
playing in local areas, and also allows consumers to
purchase tickets in advance.

      While 95 percent of calls were for information
rather than transactional purposes, MovieFone expects
purchasing to increase as the company offers other
transmission methods, company spokesman Andrew Jeske
said.

      A new kiosk service called MovieLink is being
tested quietly in a few cities throughout the country,
including New York and Los Angeles.  The interactive
kiosks use video clips to preview movies, and
MovieFone is experimenting with purchasing capability.

      The company also is exploring using its existing
Web site as a foundation for online movie information
and ticket sales, but both of these projects are still
being tested, Jeske said.

      MovieFone is at (212) 504-7557.

MITSUBISHI IN DIGITAL DMV PACT

Digi-Media Vision (DMV), the former NTL Advanc-ed Products Division now
owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, has formed an alliance with
the giant Mitsubishi Electric Corporation to develop digital set-top
boxes for worldwide MPEG-2/DVB markets.

Under the deal, Mitsubishi will start making digital receiver-decoders
at its Scottish factories, combining DMV's MPEG-2/DVB-compliant
technology with the Japanese giant's proven TV, video, telecoms and
semiconductor manufacturing skills.

A Mitsubishi spokesman said the aim is to make "300,000 units in the
first year" with the UK and Europe as launch markets.  Although the set-
top boxes would be built on an "open-access" basis for "various
programme providers", he added, it was clear BSkyB would have first
bite of the cherry depending on when and how it goes digital.  The new
joint-venture would be able to produce boxes for satellite, cable or
terrestrial digital markets with equal facility.

The new partnership follows NTL's 1994 alliance with Pace, which
resulted in the first generation of Pace-NTL digital receivers now
reaching markets worldwide.  Unlike Pace, however, Mitsubishi is not
forming a joint venture company with DMV.  The Pace-NTL joint venture -
to be renamed Pace-DMV - is not affected by the new venture.

DMV boss Mike Windram said alliances with other manufacturers and
broadcasters had been "key to the successful introduction of the new
digital technology - we intend to increase our investment in the
development of transmission and receiver technology and this type of
partnership is vital for DMV."

Though a late entrant into the European analogue satellite market with
integrated TV/IRDs, Mitsubishi signalled its intention of being a
mainstream digital player with the opening of its Visual Imaging
research labs in London last summer.  Its six European factories
include an advanced semiconductor fabrication plant which is likely to
be the source of decoder chips.

SKY-BRUNO PPV PLAN

BSkyB is considering the screening of the Tyson/ Bruno WBO World Heavy-
weight Championship on March 16 as the broadcaster's first pay-per-view
event.

However, Sky is adamant that "no decision has been made".  Bruno's last
fight, resulted in the highest ever UK satellite audience.  Curiously
advance listings for Sky Sports in March fail to mention Bruno's boxing
bout.

Tyson's last fight was time delayed by Sky, but shown live on TV1000 to
subscribers in Scandinavia.  TV1000 will also be showing the match
against Bruno.

ASTRA 1E BEGINS DIGITAL TRANSMISSIONS

The first digital services have been switched on to the newly-
commissioned Astra 1E as Astra 1F readies for launch.  However, the
lack of available receivers means that the services are only being
viewed by a select few.

The sixth Astra satellite will launch from Baikonur in Southern
Siberia, near the Mongolian border on March 28.  It will be the first
time that Astra-operator SES has used a launcher other than Ariane.

The first two channels to be switched on to Astra 1E were the German
national public broadcasters ARD and ZDF (Transponder 71).  Since
December 31 the clear MPEG-2 transmissions have been broadcast direct
from SES in Luxem-bourg after conversion from the analogue format.

The French Canal satellite package is using transponders 66 and 70; the
transmissions had previously been made from Astra 1D, which also
operates in the Astra 1D band.  The number of channels included in the
multiplex package continues to vary.

Nethold is using Tps 77 and 80 for its test transmissions from its
digital centre in Hilversum.  Again the number of programmes included
is regularly varied, but will include channels in MultiChoice's
Scandinavian package.

DIGITAL DEATH-BLOW FOR EUROSAT SA

Satellite Communications Pty, the Johannesburg-based distributor and
dish-manufacturer which traded as Eurosat South Africa has collapsed
after what founder and MD Sid Trickett describes as the "natural death"
of analogue and C-Band products at the hands of digital DTH.

Provisional liquidator Colin Fisher of Deloitte & Touche Pty said the
company's liabilities amounted to around Rand 3.5 million, against
assets of R250,000.  South Africa's Customs and Excise has a R330,000
claim to certain assets as security for their claims.  In short, Fisher
reckoned that ordinary creditors "don't have any chance" of recovering
anything from the ruins, unless a buyer comes forward before the
liquidation hearing on January 31.

Eurosat - itself "a substantial creditor" - has transferred its
franchise to Grundig International Pty.  Sid Trickett, who said he had
"personally lost R5.5 million" in the collapse, has been contracted by
Grundig to develop the satellite business.

Prior to the collapse, Trickett had signed a deal to handle Grundig's
digital IRD distribution.  Grundig planned to use badged Panasonic IRDs
- but on December 15 "the factory had burnt down".

Satellite Communications' original dish-making business "died a natural
death with the arrival of PAS-4", especially as the onset of Ku-Band
coincided with a steep rise in world prices of aluminium.

"For a while analogue Ku-Band kept us going, but when the ASEC services
from Intelsat 704 shut down, that side came to a screeching halt as
well."

COMPACT DISH HITS THE STREETS

Sky's Compact Dish campaign - the drive to promote a 48cm alternative
to the 60cm Astra dish across southern England first reported in
October's ST - goes live this month after technical and market trials.

The 48-cm `charcoal grey' mesh dish-pack, made by Lenson Heath, is
being stocked by distributors including Longreach, Eurosat and Michael
Black, but will be marketed only in the safe 48cm reception area -
which Sky defines as south of an arc from Hull to Southampton.

Sky's campaign opens on February 3 with ads in regional editions of the
national press and selected local newspapers, and a new pack of in-
store material.  Lenson Heath has geared up to produce "around 25,000
over the next month to six weeks," confirmed sales and marketing
director David Griffin: "We've already shipped 8-9,000 pieces." Griffin
added that it was "near impossible" to predict uptake, though Sky is
clearly hoping the smaller dish will bring a whole new wave of
subscribers into the fold.

GRANADA, SKY LAUNCH GSKYB

Granada and BSkyB have joined forces to launch eight new channels in

UAP VERSIONS TCC AND DISCOVERY

TCC has introduced a new version for the Nordic market while sister
channel Discovery has added a Dutch soundtrack.  A backhaul was
introduced on January 1 for TCC Nordic to feed the Thor satellite which
has previously taken the Astra version.  The backhaul is at present
transmitted in clear analogue Pal from Intelsat 601, though the
intention is to switch to an encrypted feed in the near future.

General manager Franklin Getchell said TCC Nordic had been created as a
totally separate service running for 12 hours a day as opposed to the
11 hours of the Astra service.  TCC is on-air between 06.00 and
18.00CET.  "The 12 hours will be a mix of programming.  All of the live
action programming will be regionalised, the pre-school will be added
by the end of the year." Programming for older children, including some
of the high-profile animation will be subtitled.  For younger children
dubbing will be used where the rights allow it.

Discovery, which has been available in Holland since 1989 and is
available in 4.3 million homes, will carry Dutch continuity on a
separate Astra audio subcarrier.  Teletext subtitling in the Dutch
language will also be expanded.

DIGITAL PIRATES STRIKE DIRECTV

Leading experts believe that American DBS service DirecTv is under
attack by digital satellite pirates and that the underground trade in
pirate decoders may soon be draining off subscription revenues from one
of every two DBS receiving sets sold.

Bob Sherman of Satellite Business News claimed, "Piracy could become a
huge potential problem here.  It could become the biggest problem
facing DBS.  The only reason that it is not widespread is because there
is a worldwide chip shortage right now and I think that is holding down
distribution."

Jim Shelton of Shelton and Associates, a San Diego-based consulting
firm agrees with Sherman.  "The only reason that it is not widespread
at this time is probably a shortage of computer chips.  A lot of these
chips require a 26 week lead time." Sherman previously worked at
General Instrument's San Diego-based Videocipher division where he
helped end signal piracy on C-Band dishes.

At the moment, experts believe that there are only between 5,000 to
10,000 black market DBS decoder cards in operation, but Shelton
believes it is only a matter of time before the piracy mushrooms.  "It
could become rampant.  Once they have plenty of cards, you will see
advertising break out in flyers and faxes offering the cards.  If it
continues unchecked, it won't be long before you see them manufacturing
100,000 receiving units a month, but only 50,000 are being legally
authorised." The black market access cards are being sold for between
$500-700.

DirecTv president Eddy Hartenstein has claimed that he is two steps
ahead of the hackers and that he can foil them with electronic
countermeasures or by issuing new decoder cards.  Both Shelton and
Sherman believe the problem will continue to grow.

"CURE" FOR 010 CARD TROUBLES

Difficulties with certain pre-1995 IRDs, caused by the latest Period 10
VideoCrypt smart card have been traced to a mysterious black dot on the
chip.  A number of receivers, including Pace IRDs have been affected by
problems ranging from an annoying audible tone and an unwarranted "Card
Invalid" on-screen message.

Technical author Martin Pickering says the problem clearly lies with
the card rather than individual receivers.

When tape is placed over the black dot "Card Invalid" appears on every
receiver.  The contact carries the 3.5

MHz clock pulses and acts as a resistor.  Pickering estimates it to
have a value between 1 and 2k Ohms.  As the black spot is worn away the
problem becomes worse.

By cutting the circuit track which leads to the relevant "black dot"
card holder contact, and soldering a 2k2 resistor across the cut track
the problem is apparently cured.

The same modification has been carried out on other PRD receivers, all
of which have been cured.  It is not known whether or not the cure will
work on other receivers.

SPORTS PROMO BACK FOR WORLD CUP CRICKET

Sky has reintroduced its free sports promotion ahead of the Cricket
World Cup.  Sky Sports will be screening exclusive coverage of the
tournament.  The 1992 event led to a 40 per cent surge in dish sales
and is widely believed to be responsible for that summer's shortage in
receiving equipment.

New subscribers signing up to the total Sky package will not be charged
for the sports element of the package for the first six months of their
subscription.

GRUNDIG'S HALF MILLION

The 500,000th satellite receiver recently rolled off the production
line of Grundig's South Wales factory, 20 months after its opening
straight into the hands of VP Johan van Splunter (pictured below).
Initially a joint venture be-tween Grundig and Welsh in-dustrialist Alf
Gooding, the factory is now wholly owned by Grundig and has become the
German manufacturer's sole source of receivers.

ECHOSTAR LAUNCHES DBS COMPETITION BEGINS

EchoStar successfully launched its high powered DBS satellite EchoStar
1 from China on December 28 and now hopes to be in the marketplace by
late February or early March.

EchoStar plans to launch EchoStar 2 from China during the summer.  The
service will provide over 200 channels of digital video, audio and data
services and become America's second true DBS provider, after DirecTv.
While PrimeStar offers DTH services, it transmits from a medium powered
satellite restricting its receiving dishes to a now ungainly 30 inches.
 Alpha-Star, slated to start service during the first quarter of 1996
will also transmit from a medium powered satellite.

EchoStar believes that it is in a strong position to compete with the
established American DTH and DBS providers.  To begin with it has been
in the TVRO business as a hardware supplier since 1980 and has
operations in Holland, Spain, Singapore China, Hong Kong, Indonesia and
India.

While not yet ready to release its marketing or launch plans EchoStar
plans to come into the market at prices below other DBS/DTH providers.
Its prospectus states that the retail cost or an EchoStar receiving
system will be in the $500 (#325) range, well below the cost entry
level costs of $700 (#455) for a DirecTv system.

TMS INSTALLS MULTI-SATELLITE SMATV

A multiple satellite smatv system delivering signals from Astra and two
Eutelsat craft has been installed by London-based TMS Satellite &
Aerial Systems.  The complex IF communal system was installed for the
Ladybur Housing Co-operative in Tottenham, North London to deliver
signals into 156 self contained flats.

TMS, which also has a branch in Alicante, Spain was commissioned to
design and build a system for Ladybur in March 1995, when no other
company was capable of offering a similar set-up.

The system comprised of four headends using a Televes amplifier,
splitters and five in four out tone switch controlled multi-switches.
This gave each flat the two polarities from the Astra system plus one
polarity each from the Eutelsats at 13 degrees and 10 degrees East.  It
is believed to be one of the first installations to use this method to
control four polarities from satellite together with the four UHF
terrestrial channels and FM radio through a single cable.

The configuration allows the reception of English, German, Spanish,
Dutch, Asian and Japanese channels from Astra with Eutelsat providing
programming in Arabic, Turkish, French and Polish.

SATELLITE VIEWER SERVICES WOUND UP

Satellite Viewer Services, based in Old Burlington Street, London W1,
has been compulsorily wound up in the High Court.

The petition to wind-up the company was presented to the court last
November by the Home Video Channel Limited, owners of The Adult
Channel, who said in its petition that despite demands for payment the
company remained indebted to them, was insolvent and unable to pay its
debts.

At the hearing Counsel representing HVC told the court that his client
was a trade creditor who was owed a petition debt of #31,000, and
applied to the court to wind up the company's affairs.  On his
application Mr Registrar Pimm made the order to wind-up the company.

HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU

International news channel BBC World has been on-air for 12 months, but
its presence in the UK is deliberately hidden, writes Julian Clover

Sometimes it feels as if everyone wants to run a news channel; CNN
International has been on-air for ten years and satellite viewers can
tune into news broadcasts from Berlin, Paris, London and Lyon.

1995 saw a new crop with the launch of European Business News, CNBC
Europe and BBC World, the latter formed out of BBC World Service
Television, which had broadcast to Asia as part of Star TV.  In Europe
the news channel had been carried overnight on the old entertainment
service.

The BBC Europe channel from the Intelsat 27.5oW location had evolved
out of a rough mix of BBC1 and BBC2, the result of a demand for English
language programmes from Scandinavian cable companies.  This in turn
picked up more than a passing interest from DTH viewers who tuned into
the easily hacked Save transmissions before a switch to D2 Mac was
made.  DTH subscriptions for BBC Prime, again for outside the UK, are
handled by the Swedish subscriber management service TV Extra.

Listeners to short wave will be more than familiar with some of the
titles given to BBC World's extended news programmes; BBC Newsdesk,
Newshour and Newsroom would not look out of place coming from Bush
House instead of Television Centre.  The feature programmes also have a
familiar ring about them; Breakfast with Frost, Film '96,
Correspondent, and Panorama, including that royal interview.

The European feed from Eutelsat II F1 is transmitted from the Maxat
uplink at Teddington, where advertisements sold by the BBC
Worldwide/Pearson/Cox Communications joint venture company European
Channel Management are also added.  The spaces are filled by the
"Highlights In.  .  ." trailers while the rest of the world catches up.
 "We're selling enough airtime now that at the Teddington uplink more
and more of the ads go over the previews," explains ECM managing
director Marcus Bicknell.  "If it's a four minute break which we've
sold two minutes of, then the other two minutes are on-air promotions,
promotion of teletext and promotion of specific European stuff without
the Bangkok and Tokyo times."

After working as a consultant during the start up of BBC World and the
now rebranded entertainment channel BBC Prime Bicknell, the founder
commercial director of SES and previously marketing director at The
Children's Channel and the old UK film channel Premiere, joined ECM in
June last year.  His style is anything other than what is expected from
a BBC executive, but there again ECM is run as a private company from
private capital not encroaching on the domestic licence fee.

The past 12 months since the launch have concentrated more or less on
BBC Prime.  Fine tuning the mix of current and classic BBC and Thames
programmes into a selection more suitable for the European palate.

Prime is not a channel for ex-pats: EastEnders gets a regular showing
in line with BBC1, while other popular dramas such as Casualty as shown
often within a few weeks of their domestic screening.  Purchased films
are missing from the schedule as are sports programmes Grandstand and
Match of the Day.  Over the past few months Prime has introduced a
stripped schedule with regular slots for specific programme genres.

This year BBC World will receive the treatment starting on January 1
with the introduction of the long awaited teletext service.  "What we
had previously was an anachronism which was basically a feed from
Ceefax which went on the BBC World Service Television European service.
 It continued on Prime because the server just happened to be there."
Difficulties arose from bought in information which the BBC did not
have the rights to with the providers demanding payment.  The new
service, provided by the private company Intelfax, rather than Ceefax,
will eventually feature news, business, travel and of course a detailed
programme guide for the two services.  Both Prime and World will be the
subject of a major advertising campaign this year.

Across on Intelsat 601 BBC Prime continues to broadcast in D2 Mac.  Its
movement to Eutelsat 13 degrees being unlikely while there is no single
encryption system capable of reaching the whole of Europe.

The digital horizon however paints a more attractive option.  Already
BBC World is part of the MultiChoice package in South Africa and it is
reasonable to expect that BBC World, and probably Prime, would find
itself as part of the MultiChoice packages in Europe.  Britain will
remain firmly off the agenda; there are no rights held for the UK
market and in any case the BBC's news and current affairs directorate
has ambitions for a domestic news channel as part of a terrestrial
digital multiplex.

"We get hundreds of calls a week from people interested in Prime, we
get very low conversion because when they find it's on Intelsat with a
1.2 metre dish and in D2 Mac Eurocrypt M.  .  .I haven't inherited the
most glamorous distribution policy in the world," pines Bicknell.

Distribution difficulties are coupled with a pricing policy which
requires DTH subscribers to pay the equivalent to #70 per month while
cable viewers enjoy the channel as part of a wider extended basic
package.  "It's an unfair accident of technology, satellites and
encryption and we're trying to correct it.  What you'll see when the
digital packages roll out is World moving off and getting maximum
penetration and by the end of 1996 it would be very attractive for
somebody to get both channels from the same dish."

 Digital will allow further expansion; opt-outs in programming whereby
Asia would get its own dedicated programming while the rest of the
world continues with the standard service.  Such opt outs would be
extended to allow the programme packagers to take their own individual
slots.  "Part of being relevant to a non-Anglo Saxon target audience is
to know what individual programmes have got to say." This manifests
itself in the new Window on the World programme produced in Germany by
S-Zett-Magazin which currently contributes to Vox.  Initially the
programme will be transmitted with an English soundtrack only, but
already there are plans to introduce a separate German audio channel.
7.02 MHz will be used for English and 7.20MHz for German, there are no
plans to introduce any further languages in Europe.

With the European audience in mind other new programmes have recently
been added to the World schedule; Europe Today appears as a six to
eight minute segment in the three principal news magazines BBC
Newsdesk, BBC Newsday and The World Today.  The Asian Continent also
gets its own breakfast news briefing, BBC although the transmission
time of 01.00 to 04.00GMT means BBC Newsroom will be viewed only by the
most hardy European viewer.

By the end of 1996 14 million homes had access to BBC World, a mix of
DTH from Eutelsat and cable operators in Europe, the latter bolstered
by interest from the Netherlands and Germany where a terrestrial
frequency in Berlin is also a possibility.  "The channel is good, it is
in depth and it goes that bit further," boasts Bicknell.  Typically a
news channel will be viewed for between 12 and 18 minutes, whereas BBC
World is between 24 and 35.  "This means that somebody will watch the
25 minutes news, they'll stay for an ad break, or they're watching Time
Out; Tomorrow's World, Film '96 plus the headlines." This has been a
delight for the advertisers, who are also tumbling to the fact that BBC
World is the first BBC branded channel to carry advertising in the
first place.

Despite all the success in Europe BBC World will remain forever closed
to the UK viewer despite presently being in-the-clear from Eutelsat;
"Certainly if I was talking to a CAI conference I would warn them that
it would start decaying in time because it would never be in a UK
digital package." The Eutelsat feed will remain `for the foreseeable
future' and the implication is that BBC Prime would be first to vanish
from the analogue environment within a few years.

VIDEOCRYPT 2 INTO 1 WILL GO

Quantum Trading has produced a conversion kit which allows VideoCrypt
II cards to be used in standard VideoCrypt IRDs.  The conversion is
proving particularly popular with the Asian community in Europe where
new subscribers to Zee TV are being issued with the VC2 card.  It works
with all receivers with the exception of the Echostar 8700 where the
conversion does not fit.

The conversion is made by removing the IW03 and IW05 chips inserting
the kit, then replacing the two chips into new positions.  Quantum has
been supplied with its chips by the VideoCrypt proprietary rights
holder Thomson.  Once fitted it remains possible to continue viewing
channels using both VideoCrypt I and VideoCrypt II codes.  Where a
channel is transmitting two codes the conversion will always opt for
the VideoCrypt I code.

NEW SOUND FROM PACE

Pace's latest analogue IRD - the MSS 290, due for launch at April's
Cable & Satellite Show in London - will be the first to incorporate its
new `Stereo 3D' audio circuitry to provide a near-surround-sound
experience via a normal stereo TV set.

The Stereo 3D effect - greatly enhanced spatial sound which is a big
step up from normal Nicam stereo, and one step down from full-blown
Dolby Pro-Logic active surround sound - is produced by a sound
processing chip designed by Pace engineers.  The effects are selectable
from an additional on-screen menu, and the IRD can be connected up to a
hi-fi system to maximise the three-dimensional sound impact.  The unit
can also be used for stereo VCR playback to add pseudo-surround
effrects to videos.

The MSS 290 is set to retail at #229, with the enhanced audio system
likely to be heavily promoted as an added-value feature to persuade
punters to trade up from the all-pervasive under-#100 Astra system.
Pace also intends to incorporate Stereo 3D into certain export models,
but will retain Dolby Pro Logic for its top-of-the-range MSS1000
series.

INCLINED TO A DEGREE

Inclined orbit satellites are there one minute and gone the next.  Asim
Hussein explains how to track them down

Satellite system installers, broadcasters and viewers are fortunate
because a large proportion of the satellites that beam TV back to Earth
are in stable geostationary orbits.  However, what about receiving
signals from that increasing number of satellites that seem to fade in
and out every day or which simply can't be located at times?

The reason may be that the required satellite has an inclined orbit.
Inclined that is, to the plane of the usual geostationary arc.  In the
satellite operating industry the concept of allowing satellites to move
is not new.  In the '80s the Intelsat 5 craft were all in such orbits,
and at the same time USA operator Comsat began regular inclined-orbit
operations and coined the other name for such heavenly wandering - the
Comsat Manoeuvre.

Why is this done ? It lengthens the life of satellites by saving
hydrazine fuel.  Most satellites are maintained in position by the
firing of the propulsion engines for North-South and East-West station-
keeping, leaving the bird within about 100km of the nominal position.
If this is not done every few weeks the natural gravitational forces of
the sun and moon gradually, though imperceptibly at first, force the
satellite into an inclined plane orbit by about 0.8 degrees each year.
The rocket propellant saved can be used to maintain East-West station-
keeping within 0.1 degree but not for North-South, allowing the
satellite to move up and down.

When viewed from the earth or received with a satellite dish, an
inclined-orbit satellite no longer hangs in the sky as an apparently
stationary object.  It's pattern of movement is a definite `figure 8'
pattern that repeats every 24 hours unless a motor is fired to correct
it.  (Satellites at the edge of the arc that are inclined still execute
an `8' pattern, but in the higher latitudes this is skewed).  The
benefits of fuel conservation and a longer operational life have a down
side, because inclined orbits mean tracking problems for satellite
installations on Earth.

Other effects are that the footprint illuminated by an inclined orbit
satellite varies too, this can cause signal fluctuation.  SCPC, a
narrow band signal type, is even affected by Doppler shift, as the
velocity of the satellite changes so does the received frequency eg A
satellite inclined by 2 degrees changes frequency by a maximum of
1.5kHz.

Polar capped

One dealer has kept his eye on the ball and on these moving satellites.
 Smallworld Satellite of Birmingham has put together a winning
combination of the TSS Inclined Orbit Polar-mount, for which it has
sole UK distribution and the very latest 1500 channel Chaparral
Monterey 140 receiver-positioner.  Ordinary polar-mounts allow tracking
across the East-West arc but the TSS mount can be moved in elevation
too (up and down to you and me).  This is achieved through some rugged
galvanised steel metalwork and roller bearings which allow two
actuators to be attached, one for each plane of movement.  Control of
each actuator could be achieved by the use of a receiver positioner and
an additional positioner.  However, the smart consumer will opt for the
easy option, which is to use the Monterey 140.  The flagship receiver
has an inclined interface unit built-in and the effects were most
impressive.

ST was shown how a satellite position can be stored within the
receiver's memory.  On returning to that nominal position from another
satellite, the receiver stops.  It tracks East and West slightly to
peak the signal, but if the satellite has moved it will track the dish
up and then down, until a signal is traced.  It will then peak again,
side to side for optimum signal and repeat the process until a peak is
obtained.

Once locked onto a satellite, the receiver can be programmed to check
that maximum signal is being achieved by tracking imperceptibly in each
direction, without disrupting the signal.  This check can occur at
regular intervals with a time delay of one to 60 minutes.

When we used the system it was hooked up to a 2.5 metre prime focus
dish situated at Smallworld's showroom and roof-top dish site in
Birmingham, just off the M6 motorway.  We observed the Russian C-Band
TV signals from the wobbly 11 degrees West and 40 degrees East
satellites - they were tracked accurately and without a break.  When
the feed-horn was covered and tracking lost, the receiver caused the
two motors to track and signal was restored within a few seconds.

At the more usual Ku-Band, the higher frequency means that the
beamwidth, the tiny angle over which any satellite can be received
before it fades, is much reduced.  The test dish had a beamwidth of 0.8
between the 6dB signal points (see table 2).  A 6dB decrease in signal
strength is enough of a loss for signal near threshold to become
unwatchable.  However, even dishes of one metre diameter, with a beam-
width of nearer 1.5, suffer when Ku-Band satellites are inclined.  Just
try following a feed on the Eutelsat I F4 at 25.5 degrees, which moves
through a massive 4.2 degrees each day.  This system is a boon to
anyone wishing to track the satellites listed in our table 1 or for the
low elevation satellites that most polar mounts miss.

The TSS Inclined Polarmount can be used with a variety of dishes like
Trac, Triax, Precision, Channel Master suitable for adaptation.
Smallworld recommends an optical actuator arm for accurate North-South
tracking without backlash (hysteresis).  Besides the Monterey 140, some
other receivers such as Drake and Echostar can use the TSS mount.
Malcolm Titmus, Smallworld's proprietor can supply and install systems
for inclined orbit operation, normal multi-satellite systems and fixed
dish installations.  An inclined system has been installed at a
professional TV broadcaster's site; they no longer have to worry about
losing signal at a critical moment.  This was all achieved at the
fraction of the cost of previous tracking systems.  The TSS Inclined
Tracking Polarmount starts at #299.

MONTEREY'S LITTLE BROTHER

With its latest receiver, the m60e, chaparral has again proved it knows
how to manufacture a top class receiver.  Rob Ulrich took the new baby
home to play.

Currently there's a great demand for low cost receivers to be used as
fixed systems.  However, low cost usually means back to basics: poor
audio and video quality and no extra features like an on-screen
display, VCR timers, low threshold, etc.  What about the M60e? is the
Chaparral M60e a real basic product? Chaparral usually stands for high
tech and top quality, so has San Jose's finest sold out?

Chaparral is one of the leading manufacturers of LNBs, polarisers and
high-end satellite receivers.  At last year's Cable & Satellite show
Chaparral introduced the e-series providing low cost receivers for both
fixed and steerable systems.  Amsterdam's The Satellite Shop (TSS)
recently introduced the first model in the series, the M60e.  TSS is
the sole distributor for Europe for this receiver.

Design-wise M60e is very familiar.  The designers chose the same
styling as their previous creation, the Monterey 140.  The M60e is a
mid-sized satellite receiver, especially designed for fixed dishes.  A
four-digit LED-display is located on the front panel, as well as some
small buttons for channel up/down, volume and standby.  The back panel
is a surprise - Chaparral has introduced Scart sockets for connecting a
decoder and a VCR.  There are also phono outputs for audio, video and
baseband plus quick-fit connectors for an external 12 Volt device and a
mechanical polariser.  On both LNB inputs several LNB types can be
connected.  Not only LNBFs, such as a quatroband or an Astra Universal
LNBF, but also standard C and Ku-Band LNBs.  The M60e can also be used
in any multifeed or C/Ku-Band system.

The frequency range of the M60e runs from 950 to 2050MHz while the IF
bandwidth can be adjusted to 27, 18, 15 or 13MHz.  When choosing 13 or
15MHz the internal threshold extender is also activated.  Another
surprise on the M60e is the absence of an original Wegener audio
compander, a feature which always has been part of Chaparral receivers.
 The M60e is equipped with the Philips TDA 8741 chip - effectively the
next best thing to Wegener.  The audio channels are tuneable between
five and nine MHz and there are two audio IF bandwidths (150/330kHz).

The M60e has an easy to use on-screen display for (re-) programming the
200 channels.  The distributor has already programmed the channels with
the most popular stations on Astra and Eutelsat, but if you want to
change them all are freely programmable.

Pressing the Menu key on the remote control brings up the first on-
screen display menu page on the screen.  This menu page includes the
event timer, parental lock, copy mode, channel erase, frequency offset
and data transfer.  The event timer allows nine events to be recorded
over a period of four weeks.  Nine of the 200 channels can be stored as
favourites.  With the data transfer option the memory of one M60e can
be transferred to another M60e.  When menu key is pressed again, the
second menu page appears.  With this menu we can change the frequency,
LNB input, polarity (when a LNBF is connected) or skew (when using a
mechanical polariser), deviation and activate the internal 22kHz
generator for band switching with a quatroband LNBF.  The frequency
displayed on the menu is the IF frequency, in Normal (Ku-Band) mode
between 950 and 2050MHz, in Invert (C-Band) mode between 3100 and
4200MHz.  The third menu page (yes, after pressing on Menu again) is
the audio menu.  With this menu the audio frequency, de-emphasis and
bandwidth can all be adjusted.

In our testlab, we connected the M60e to an 80cm and a 1.40m dish to
get an impression of the video quality.  A Videotek video monitor was
used to provide information about the video.  The chroma delay of the
M60e is good compared to many other quality receivers.  Looking at the
picture more closely, we discovered less video noise than found on
other receivers.  Our overall impression of the video quality was very
good.

But what about the sound quality? As we said, the M60e is the first
Chaparral receiver without an original Wegener compander.  Comparing it
to, for instance, the Monterey 140 is not fair.  The M60e produces a
nice sound, but of course not as transparent as the Monterey 140.
That's why the price is low.  Besides that, only real Wegener
companders can reproduce the best Wegener sound.  The threshold
extender of the M60e expands the amount of weak signals which can be
received.  We did some experiments on Nile TV on Eutelsat II F3.
Without using the threshold extender, we could only see a picture
covered with sparklies.  But when the bandwidth was switched to 13MHz,
Nile TV appeared on the screen minus the sparklies! We had the same
experience with the CMT signal on Intelsat 601 and some C-Band signals
on both Intelsat 702 and Arabsat 1C.  The quality of the picture is
surprisingly good.  Imagine what can happen with these signals when
using a 3m dish! Without any doubt the M60e is a very interesting
receiver for the Middle East and African countries, where the signal
strength is lower than in Europe.

In Europe the M60e can be used for receiving almost every satellite
signal.  After connecting several decoders (Pace VC100, Philips BDE 353
and Luxcrypt) the picture was as good as that on unencrypted signals.
It took only a few seconds until the decoders were activated.

The Chaparral M60e is an interesting and easy to use receiver with some
unique features.  We tried this impressive receiver on both C and Ku-
Band systems.  The threshold extender impressed and gave a big
advantage on weak signals, such as Nile TV on Eutelsat II F3.  The
quality of both video and audio was good, exactly what we might expect
from Chaparral.  Most surprising is the price.  The new small Chaparral
receiver will retail for only #199.

FASTER, HIGHER, FURTHER

Satellite offers the whole gamut of sporting action.  Touchline
reporter Julian Clover looks at who has the top events and finds Sky is
not the only place to watch the premiership.

Each year there are key events which stand out in the sporting calendar
and every year satellite television, or should that read Sky, helps
itself to more of them.  There is no doubting the pulling power of
Premiership Football, World Cup Cricket or Formula 1 motor racing to
encourage that purchasing decision.

Sky continues to add to its sports roster to the frustration of the
terrestrial channels, and assorted backbench MPs, while Eurosport is
often able to supplement network television with extended coverage of
events such as Formula 1 alongside its own exclusives.  FilmNet has now
spun off Supersport as a standalone channel in both the Benelux and
Nordic countries, though this will only be available to the few able to
access digital transmissions.  Sportkanalen, in D2 Mac, will join the
virtually free-to-air package at five degrees East in March.

Super Sunday and Monday Night Football have become key fixtures in
themselves throughout the football season and will be joined in the
autumn by fixtures from the Endsleigh League.  Sky claims that this
will cover all three divisions and not just the clubs in Division One.
Full Saturday afternoon coverage of every game on the Premiership
programme may have to wait until digital makes its UK debut, but
Scandinavian viewers can already tune in.  Saturday afternoons on NRK
(in clear D Mac from Intelsat 702) or TV2 (encrypted in D2 Mac).  These
are typically the matches being taped for BBC1's Match of the Day later
that evening.  TV Pluss also shows delayed matches from around
18.00CET.  Sweden's TV4 from Sirius also has the rights to screen
Saturday afternoon matches.

FilmNet and SuperSport subscribers can also view English Premiership
matches, normally screened simultaneously with Sky, although Monday
night matches on FilmNet 1 (formerly FilmNet Plus) are normally time
delayed by about an hour.  FilmNet/SuperSport's commitment to football
also takes in coverage of the Dutch, Italian and German leagues,
according to which version you watch.  FilmNet (Central Europe) from
Astra in VideoCrypt II continues to screen occasional local matches
from Poland.

SuperSport is currently available as a standalone channel on cable to
Belgium, Holland and Scandinavia.  It's distributed by satellite in
digital format from Astra and Intelsat 601.  Availability will increase
in line with the roll-out of digital reception equipment.

Naturally the German broadcasters have extensive coverage of the
Bundesliga; Sat1 follows the fortunes in its programme Ran.  German
Internation-als are typically live on ARD or ZDF.  Channel 4's Italian
football feed can be found on Eutelsat II F3 while the sole purpose of
Rai Tre's Sunday only broadcasts are for the late night round up of the
weekend's matches.

Rugby Super League coverage begins on March 29 as the Sheffield Eagles
travel to France to play the newly formed Paris team.  Sky is promising
to screen every Super League club at least twice in the first two
months of the season.

Eurosport's great strength lies in its ability to stay with an event
and nothing will be more true this summer when it provides 24 hour
coverage of the Olympic Games in Atlanta.  In addition to continuing
Formula One coverage Eurosport will screen live each round of the
Indycar World Series.  British drivers Mark Blundell and Johnny Herbert
have both been offered drives.  The Motorcycle Grand Prix season will
also be shown in full, live and exclusive.

Slightly slower bicycles, though not by far, will be on display in the
Tour de France.  Eurosport will also be screening European PGA Golf,
Equestrian World Cup and the Ice Hockey World Cup.

The Racing Channel continues to cover typically two, sometimes three
race meetings daily.  This is supplemented by the return of evening
racing in Sky Sports The Winning Post, produced by The Racing Channel
alongside the early morning Racing News.

DOING IT BY THE BOOK

Installation practices need tightening up now that digital is on the
way, writes Bill Collins

It is no secret that the world of television and radio is heading
towards digital, raising new issues in respect of installation
practice.  To help installers, Astra will soon be publishing a new
Guide to Professional Dish Installation which is specifically designed
to address these issues.  The original brochure, which has proved very
popular since its original publication in 1993, contains tips and
reminders on how to avoid problems when installing analogue satellite
systems.  The new guide is concerned not only with the practicalities
of satellite dish installation but also understanding the differences
that digital will make and helping installers to avoid the pitfalls.

Digital transmission relies on a different modulation technique to the
earlier analogue satellite signals whose modulation was different to
terrestrial broadcasts.  These differences are important for installers
in that they create different reactions to similar problems in
installation.  A small error in cabling which can cause teletext drop-
out on a terrestrial installation can cause sparklies on an analogue
satellite system.  The same error on a digital installation can
completely obliterate the signal.

Quadrature Phase Shift Key (QPSK) is the modulation technique used for
transmission of digital signals via satellite.  The reception of QPSK
signals depends fundamentally on the receiver recognising the phase of
the incoming signal.  It follows that any defect in the reception
system that interferes with the signal phase will substantially degrade
the reception.  A dictionary definition of phase is given as `That
fraction of the period which has elapsed in a periodic function or wave
measured from some fixed origin' Another way of looking at it is the
position along the peaks and troughs of a waveform.

If the time for one period is represented as 360 degrees along a time
axis, the phase position, at any particular moment, is called the phase
angle.  For example the phase angle at the position marked `X' in
Figure 1 is 225 degrees.  Recognition of the phase angle is simple
where the signal is clearly defined but any interference effects that
disturb, or otherwise disguise, the phase can be the source of serious
problems for digital reception.

By far the most common cause of phase disturbance is mismatching in the
system.  Impedance changes generate reflections of the main signal that
can bounce backwards and forwards within a network.  These impedance
changes are known as mismatches.  The reflections show as standing
waves on the cable which, because they are of the same
frequency/wavelength as the original signal, will be combined by the
receiver and seen as a single waveform which may have completely
different characteristics to the original.

A mismatch can be caused by a number of factors.  Physical damage to
the cable, poorly made connections, water ingress, or even just kinking
of the cable by making a bend too tight are all common causes of
mismatching.  Poor quality cable can show `ripple,' a kind of built in
mismatch caused by low grade production machinery and methods, even
with no induced faults caused during installation

Figure 2 illustrates some of the effects of a mismatch.  When the
original signal reaches the mismatch point some of it is reflected back
along the cable.  One effect of this is to lower the signal level
initially passing through the mismatch point to the receiver.  Secondly
the reflected signal passing back along the cable will generate further
reflections at previous mismatches or even the connection at the signal
origin.  The phase, or peaks and troughs, of each of these reflections
will have different positions to the original waveform.

The resulting signal arriving at the receiver is a combination of both
the waveforms (a) and (b) at the right-hand side of the mismatch point.
 The amplitude, shape and phase of the signal seen by the receiver, as
shown in Figure 3, can be radically different to the original.  By its
very nature this article can only offer a simple illustration of what
is a very complex problem.  Within a satellite system the reflections
and their standing waves are infinitely more complex than that shown
here.

The effect on phase of even a single standing wave can be sufficient to
prevent reception of a digital TV channel, but in a real installation
there may be a very large number of mismatch reflections combining at
the receiver.  Care and attention to detail and use of good quality
materials has always been the mark of the true professional.  This will
be even more applicable in the digital future than it is today.
Whereas earlier modulation techniques were more forgiving in terms of
installation quality, digital allows little room for error.

OPEN UP THE BOX

It's time to grab a screwdriver, and to prise the lid off the box to
see what's inside.  How are digital decoders organised and why do they
cost as much as they do? Gwyn Morgan explains.

In the last two articles we have taken a look at the theoretical side
of digital television, how vision and sound compression works and how
the `packets' of data are numbered and labelled in tables so that the
decoders know how to sort them out and put them into television
services.  Now it's time to open up the box and look inside.

If we are talking about DTH digital satellite television then we really
need to start outside the house at the LNB attached to the dish which
in most cases will need to be changed for digital reception.  You can
broadcast digital services on almost any satellite using almost any
frequency and all sorts of bandwidths from very narrow to very wide.
But for Direct-to-Home consumer services virtually all the digital
channels will be broadcast in the BSS (Broadcast Satellite Services)
frequency bands.  So far we have been used to Astra and Eutelsat
services broadcast in the FSS range from 10.7 to 11.7 Gigahertz (GHz).
Virtually all the LNBs installed until recent months will only work
between this range of FSS frequencies.  The digital services will
operate at a higher frequency range from 11.7 to 12.75GHz.

The extra frequencies are not the only reason that new LNBs are needed
for digital satellite reception.  Digital signals are rugged and can
resist interference and noise very effectively but digital equipment is
much more susceptible to "jitter" than analogue equipment.  Jitter, or
"Phase Noise" is the equivalent of a continual small change in
frequency caused by noise or lack of stability of the oscillator in the
LNB.  Lack of stability might itself be caused by poor regulation of
the low voltage power supply from the cable.

The new Universal LNBs are now recommended for all satellite
installations.  They will receive all the analogue services that are
available today but they will also tune to the BSS frequencies for
digital services when they arrive.  Universal LNBs will also provide
the high stability, or low "phase noise" that is essential to feed
digital receivers.

Once the signal lands inside the receiver the first thing it meets is
the tuner-demodulator.  A digital tuner/demodulator is rather different
from the analogue version.  It will probably look the same - a small
shiny tin box on the PCB - and in essence it will do much the same
task.  First it tunes to the correct carrier frequency for the service
you need and filters out one group or "multiplex" of digital services
from a particular transponder on the satellite.  The digital data is
carried on the satellite signal using Quadrature Phase Shift Keying
(QPSK) which is very loosely a digital equivalent of the FM (frequency
modulation) used for analogue services.  An analogue tuner/demodulator
will not work for digital signals.  The digital QPSK demodulator
extracts the original Os and 1s that were inserted at the transmission
point.

The next task for the tuner/demodulator is to remove the "Forward Error
Correction" a sort of digital equivalent of a postal jiffy bag.

In the last article we saw how all the digital packets are sorted and
labelled and assembled into a "Transport Stream".  The transmission
path from broadcaster to receiver can get very nasty with noise,
interfering frequencies, fading and all the many disasters that the
signals encounter on the way.  So to keep the transport stream from
being damaged beyond recognition it needs to be neatly packaged in its
digital jiffy bag which naturally needs a suitably technical title.  It
is called Forward Error Correction because you add the correction data
before you transmit the signal, fully expecting that the signal is
going to get pushed, punched and stamped on as it makes its way to
through the airwaves.

Forward error correction works in several different ways.  First it
mixes up the order that the data is transmitted.  The chances are that
interference will come as a burst of noise that comes and goes - just
like a noisy motorbike driving past your house.  If you mix up the bits
so that some of the early parts of the transmission are transmitted
next to some of the later parts then the effect of the burst of noise
will be less noticeable because it will be spread out and will affect
isolated parts of the transmission.  This technique is called
convolutional coding.

On its own mixing up the bits and changing their sequence is not
enough.  You have to add extra data bits as well as mix up the data.
The extra data lets the decoder do some simple arithmetic to check that
the digital bits have been received correctly.  For example if I said
that all the words I wrote would have a number after them (4) to (2)
say (3) how (3) many (4) letters (7) there should be in each word you
would soon tell if something was incorrect (5) (= wrong).  The larger
the number of extra bits you add so the more errors you can correct but
of course the transmission then becomes less efficient overall so there
is always a trade-off to make.

When the decoder finds that some of the data has been corrupted on the
way it does not have to give up and throw it away.  When it discovers
there are errors the arithmetic will not only let it correct some of
the errors, but if things get really bad the decoder will make a best
guess at what the data should have been, using a technique called
Viterbi.

When the digital bits are flying in at a rate of tens of millions bits
per second then the forward error correction circuits in the decoder do
not have much time to hang around.  This technology alone is a high
tech function that needs specially dedicated, fast integrated circuits.

But the fact that a digital receiver can correct lots of errors does
not provide any leeway for poor installations.  In analogue FM
transmission you get some warning that reception might be poor because
there is a relatively smooth slope as the signal becomes worse and the
sparklies appear on the screen.  With digital technology it is more
like a cliff-edge than a slope.  Once you reach the point where the
receiver cannot cope with the errors the whole process suddenly comes
to a halt without any real warning and that is much more disturbing
than a smooth onset of sparklies.  For that reason a good installation
has to provide a large margin above the point of failure so that signal
failure becomes a very rare event.

So far we have barely got past the first part of the decoder and we
have already encountered some exotic technology.

One transponder could be carrying eight or more programme services in
the "multiplex" or "transport stream" of data.  The next stage of the
decoder is called the de-multiplexer which picks out the particular
items that the viewer has chosen.  Assume the viewer chooses a
particular programme which will have a picture and stereo sound.  The
tables that are transmitted with the transport stream explain which
packet numbers belong to which programme so when the viewer selects say
Discovery then the demultiplexer might be told to find all the packets
labelled 72 for the vision and the packets labelled 24 for the sound.
The demultiplexer is like the signal box in a railway shunting yard
which sets the points to send some packets off to the vision circuits
and others off to the sound circuits but unlike a railway shunting yard
it can throw away all the packets it does not need.

Now things are much clearer because we have a stream of digital vision
signals and a stream of digital sound signals which belong to one
television service.

The vision packets go to the vision decompression chip and the next
article will look at all this and all the other components that go to
create a digital decoder.

HEAVENS ABOVE

37.5oW: Orion 1

Following last month's Channel One (UK) deal, Orion and NTL have bagged
another UK cable channel.  Perfor-mance - The Arts Channel is to
deliver to cable via this satellite too, using the NTL London uplink.
Black Entertainment Television starts digital transmission here for
cable distribution this year.

27.5oW: Intelsat 601

Temporary access to TCC and Discovery is now possible with a 1.2 metre
dish through much of Europe, the channels share 11055MHz horizontal,
Tp.  72A.  This is a feed into Thor, besides main Swedish at 6.65MHz
there are four soundtracks for Scandinavia, 7.02MHz Norwegian, 7.20MHz
Danish and 7.38MHz Finnish.  Transmissions are in clear Pal.  CMT
Europe's signal looks like it has improved.

3oE: Telecom 1C & 2C

Ariane Flight 81 did its job and Telecom 2C is already on station.
Transfer of Ku-Band services is imminent and the use of the new
horizontal Ku-Band transponders at this location.  The disappearance of
that old familiar Mulhouse Telecom 1 test-card, which has been with
Telecom viewers for at least the last six years, will herald the
operational use of the new generation Telecom satellite.  Telecom 2C is
also a military communications spacecraft as it has the Syracuse 2
system operating at 7/8GHz.  The actual launch from Kourou, French
Guiana, was at 2323GMT December 6.  Expect some digital transmissions
here.

5oE Tele-X & Sirius

Confirmation of the number of digital channels on Tele-X; Telenor has
two Danish channels, two Swedish channels and one Norwegian channel all
around 12322MHz.  Kinnevik has encoded the TV6 signal in D2 Mac.  TV3
and ZTV have just scrambled too.

10oE: Eutelsat II F2

Med TV had an off-day recently when the Smartcrypt from the feed
channel ended up on the main output.  Med TV has claimed that attempts
to disrupt its signal were made recently.  It is not clear if the
uplink to this satellite or the feeds between sites were the target.
Nor is it clear if there really was a deliberate attempt to jam a
satellite transponder, which would be a first in Europe, although there
have been many accidental instances.  London, that unlikely haven of
clandestine TV, has a new potential visitor; Serb TV is the next
station to try to gain a UK uplink licence, much to the probable
embarrassment of the UK Government.  The studios will be in Paris.  A
feed into TV2 Denmark used 11163MHz horizontal.

13oE: Eutelsat II F1 & Hot Bird 1

Latest arrival, in clear Pal with stereo at 7.02/7.2 and slightly low
level audio is Onyx, a long expected fifth German music channel.  It
airs 18 hours a day with a mix of music to appeal to a more mature
audience.  11146MHz is the frequency, trans-ponder 22A.  Auto-noumus
Televisao de Catalunya has appeared again, last seen at 11492MHz
vertical, transponder 14.  The audio feed of BBC World Service on NBC
Super Channel 7.38 MHz is now WRN2 with Vatican Radio.  A rather small
media player, the sole 12GHz broadcaster on this satellite, AB1 Channel
of France, is the beginning of yet another, French digital channel
package, this is the seventh to be announced.  The transponder may
still be able to preempted by other users, as a feed for Reuters was
noted.  Polonia 1, which retreated to the upper half of Tp.34 on this
satellite when legal pressure forced it off terrestrial transmitters,
is re-launched in the market with more sports and music.  TRT on
11818MHz is now accompanied by an FM Turkish radio on 7.02/7.2 MHz.
Tp.45, 11542 MHz is earmarked for Italy's Telepiu to compress six TV
channels.

16oE: Eutelsat II F3

Telepace, the channel from Vatican TV has had some extended programming
lately and may be expanding.  This is a good satellite for feeds;
11163MHz can be quiet but saw a TF1 feed from the Russian capital.
After 1800GMT that channel is used by Thaiwave, the DM56 per month
channel.  It feeds into BT London from Bangkok via an Intelsat feed.
Its future scrambling system is not settled.  The schedule is planned
to be 1800-2300 GMT, starting at 1400 at weekends but has yet to
materialise.  It is presently Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat & Sun from 1800-
2000GMT.  11638MHz is used for feeds sometimes and 12542MHz is active
too.  Apna TV has not been seen again on this satellite, nor Ku-Band
Gorizont.

19.2oE: Astra 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D & 1E

More MPEG-2 tests are being seen above 11700MHz from Astra 1E and some
digital tests used Astra 1D as well.  Actual broadcasts from ARD and
ZDF have started being up-linked from Betzdorf to 11836MHz horizontal.
Canalsatellite of France has left Astra 1D tests behind and settled on
Astra 1E transponders 66, 11739MHz vertical and Tp.70, 11817MHz
vertical.  On 11953.5 and 11993MHz, transponders 77 and 80 are being
used by Nethold.  Beacon frequency for the satellite is 11202 vertical
and 10948.5MHz horizontal and it is actually at 19.15 degrees East.
The channels and video being shown on most of the above frequencies
change frequently, while there is no audience.  Although Astra 1E is
going to have a slow start, Astra 1F is due to launch next month.
Rival Hot Bird 2 does not fly until October.  A new name for Tp.  11
FilmNet Plus on Astra, it is now FilmNet 1.  Daytime Tp.  49 110714 MHz
horizontal is filled by 11 hours of Nickelodeon Germany, Arte uses the
evening slot.  Arte also shares with La Cinquieme on 13 degrees East
and five degrees West.  New to Astra 1D is Tp.  61 Home Order
Television, German tele-shopping with an uncluttered screen.  The
channel is due to move to Astra 1E this year.  America One radio
launched as expected on 11538MHz at 7.74MHz with some shared
programming with WRN1 on 7.38MHz.  On Pro 7, Star*Sat Radio and Radio
Ropa have ceased analogue transmission and gone ADR, where Germany
leads the way.  The ADR versus analogue score is 53 analogue against 40
digital, not counting the DMX channels.

48oE: DFS1 Kopernikus

This satellite has gone walkabout twice in recent months.  The first
amble was in late November, the second in mid-December.  The satellite
formerly known as Kopernikus 1, once a full TV satellite, seems to be
potential space junk.  Using the beacons to track it, it was last
tracked moving East, a long way from the supposed 33.5 degrees East
home.  The satellite may never now return to anything near operational
use.
