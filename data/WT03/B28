HOW TO MARKET 'GOOD FOR YOU' PRODUCTS TO KIDS AND THEIR PARENTS

      You have a great educationally oriented product, which is
actually quite entertaining - a CD-ROM perhaps, or an electronic
learning aid (ELA) - but the kids seem to be passing it by for the
latest offering from Nintendo.
      Their parents are interested in the product, and want to be sure
that it has bona fide educational value, but the kids just want to
have fun. 
      How do you market two messages - educational and entertaining -
about one product to two audiences?
      Simple, says Cynthia Colmenares, vice president of sales and
marketing at Comfy Inc. Use one medium to carry two distinct messages.
      The company, a creator of an electronic learning aid product
with add-on software that plugs into a PC or Macintosh, needed to
emphasize to parents that its electronic activity center, which
retails for about $99, would definitely help their children on the
road to computer literacy, and to the mastery of many learning skills.
      Yet, kids needed to know that the product would be fun to use.
      Comfy launched a television commercial campaign on Cable News
Network and Nickelodeon in which two streams of information were
simultaneously directed to the parents and the kids.
      The voice-over in the first commercial, called "First Step," is
directed at parents, and talks to parents about watching their kids
take their first steps, utter their first words, and use their first
computer.
      The visuals in the commercial, however, are directed at kids,
which depict children having fun with their families and older
siblings at the computer.
      The visuals in the second commercial depict young and older
children laughing and playing with the product, while the voice-over
once again emphasized to the parent the educational values of the
product.        
      Comfy made sure to broadcast the commercials at times when both
kids and parents would see t. They appeared Saturday morning and
during the early evening half-hour sitcom time frame. Comfy, which
began its TV ad campaign last year, is still running in the New York
market. 
      There are companies who do not try to market to the younger
customer at all, saying that parents are the major purchasers, and
marketing should be directed at them.  Fisher Price, for example, says
it does not market educational toys to the 6 and under set because
they believe the kids are just too young to absorb a marketing
message.
      There are ways to convey to kids that your educational product
is fun, without actually conducting a formal marketing campaign,
however.        
      While no marketing is specifically aimed at kids, company
spokesperson Linda Duttenhauer at Davidson & Associates, Inc., a
company which led the market with educational products such as its
"Blaster" series of math and reading CD-ROMS,  said that there are
ways to communicate a sense of fun and play to kids.
      The company points to the product's packaging, which are
colorful and contain characters that are fun and appealing to kids.
Davidson has also created a Web site (http://www.davd.com) that
contains a Fun Zone for kids to play games online.
      An excellent example of a best-selling educational product
marketed differently to parents and kids may be Broderbund Software
Inc.'s "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego," a CD-ROM product (with
spin-off television shows and assorted products), that teaches kids
about geography as they assume the guise of a detective and search for
clues to find the elusive character. "Where in the World is Carmen
Sandiego" has sold more than 5 million copies since its debut. There
are currently six different Carmen Sandiego software titles available.

      The company, which pioneered in the educational software segment
in 1985 with the release of its first Carmen Sandiego product,
targeted parents and kids in different ways, first by creating a
product that contains the educational/entertainment balance.
      Parent-focused ads, which appeared in consumer software
magazines such as Family PC, PC Magazine and Home PC, conveyed the
serious but entertaining character of the CD-ROMs, in order to get 
parents to understand the educational benefit of the product, said
Jennifer Apy, product marketing manager at Broderbund. 
      Interestingly, parents also need to know that the product is
entertaining as well as educational, because, said Apy, "parents know
'good for you' products are not kid-cool, and kids won't sit with it."
      Comfy, which has plans to launch a product line for older
children ages 8 to 14 in '97, says it plans to market to both segments
again, since purchases of electronic toys and edutainment products
tend to be family decisions.
      "The main thing we have tried to do is look at the product and
design and market it from the kids' point of view," says Colmenares. 
      This perspective makes sense, and seems to be reaching the kids:
Comfy reports that they've had 6-year-olds call their 800 number to
find out more about the company's Comfy Activity Center.
      Early on in the product's roll-out, in 1994, the company also
created pint-sized kiosks which it placed in retail stores, so kids
would be attracted to trying out the product. And, after becoming
familiar with the characters in the software, the kids would get
everything from little rulers, to stickers to pencils, all with the
name of the company and its phone number, and with pictures of those
characters.  In July 1996, the company also installed the kiosks in
day care centers and Montessori schools to expose kids to the product.
      The best educational product delivers the educational component,
but makes the education transparent to kids. 
      To target  kids, and convey that the brand is  "cool,"
Broderbund cultivates licensing agreements that keep the products
fresh and "cool" in the kids' minds. he licensing agreements include
two fast-paced television shows, appearing on Fox Kids Network and the
Public Broadcasting System, as well as books, games and puzzles.
      "You've really got to strike that educational-entertainment
balance at the product level" before sending out dual marketing
messages, said Apy. (Comfy, Cynthia Colmenares, 510/668-4870; Linda

THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF A SUCCESSFUL SITE

      Though Web sites suggest instantaneous opportunities to talk to
kids, follow their interests and get feedback on your products,
building a Web site that will yield important data - and keep the kids
interested - is a gradual process.
      And when it is built and monitored correctly, kids can find the
information they need easily, and companies can keep pace with kids by
changing their Web sites as fast as kids change their minds.
      LEGO Systems, Inc., based in Enfield, Conn., the U.S. division
of the Denmark-based LEGO Group, found this to be true when the LEGO
Web site went online in March.
      Though kids had written to the maker of colorful, plastic bricks
and construction sets to start a Web site, company officials instead
first informally monitored an unofficial LEGO user Web site to see
what customers were saying about the company and its products. Users
visited the unofficial Web site to talk about new products coming out,
exchange personal opinions about products and hold auctions for
hard-to-find LEGO sets.
      After six months of planning, the official LEGO Web site was
opened (www.lego.com) - without a great deal of fanfare. The company's
rationale was that a Web site is an extension of a company's brand,
and a poorly executed or serviced site could affect how customers see
the company. Instead of making global announcements and finding itself
unprepared for the volume, LEGO proceeded with caution.        
      "If you set it up too quickly, and it's lousy, that's all the
kids will remember," said Steve Hawco, director of direct marketing
for LEGO Systems Inc. "We were concerned that we would get inundated
with traffic."
      Instead, users found out about the Web site through
word-of-mouth and through exploring the Web, and LEGO saw heavy
traffic on the site in its first few months.
      Visits to the site peaked in June and July, and has reached a
steady rate, attracting approximately 10,000 visitors a week, said
company representatives. The site is maintained in Denmark, though
representatives of the privately held company declined to share the
cost of maintaining the site. Company representatives did say that
part of the maintenance costs involve how often the company refreshes
the site, something LEGO Systems has not yet determined.

Web site is a Give and Take

      LEGO's Web site has been set up to both gather information on
the kids (and adults) that use its  products, and give kids and their
parents the opportunity to customize the information they receive from
the company by allowing them to choose to receive information on
products they select.
      Along with providing information on the history of the company,
and a worldwide listing of where LEGO products are sold, the Web site
asks kids their name, gender, age, where they live, the type of
computer they have, and whether it has CD-ROM capability. The company,
which markets its products globally, asks for computer hardware
information so it knows what users around the world will be using to
look at the Web pages, and tries to take that into consideration when
designing the pages. 
  The Web site is sprinkled with LEGO bricks and characters
throughout, which underlies a basic principle of marketing on the
Intenet - the Web site should extend the brand visually, using
familiar imagery, such as LEGO bricks in this case, but it also needs
to go beyond that. The marketing challenge is how to take an existing
brand, and translate the feel of that brand onto a Web site to enhance
the brand.        
      "The entire presentation of the Web site should be in sync with,
and true to the existing brand," said Tom Robbins, vice president and
director of communications, Foote, Cone, & Belding/Los Angeles, a
global advertising agency which has created Web sites for Levi Strauss
aimed at teens.
      If you're marketing a brand with a cool, hip image, or an
educational brand identity, then the graphics, the pace, and even the
links on the site should reflect that. 
      Using the colors and characters that kids associate with the
brand is just one way way to establish that continuity. 
      On the LEGO Web site, kids are asked to supply their e-mail
address; if they do, they receive a membership certificate. They are
also asked if they want to receive e-mail on specific product lines,
with a listing of those product lines. So far, said Hawco,
approximately 25,000 users have registered their e-mail addresses.

Targeting All Ages

      One of the common frustrations of marketing a diverse product
line such as LEGO's to a customer base that ranges from 3-months- to
16-years-old is that kids within that group have very different needs
and interests.
      Taking that into consideration, the company maintains a free
club, called the LEGO Club, for kids ages 5 to 12. When kids sign up,
they receive a magazine called LEGOmania six times a year - which must
be broadly focused to reach that entire group. 
      On a Web site, it's possible to create links to information
organized by age group or product line, making it possible to talk to
kids at an appropriate level, and specifically to their interests. 
      The real value in marketing to kids on the Internet is the
ability of  the electronic medium to give kids what they ask for
almost immediately, and - if the Web site is designed well - to
customize the type of information they receive from the company.
      "Because the Internet is new and interesting, marketers seem to
have forgotten their basic marketing lessons," said Andrew Watt, COO,
Cyber Dialogue, an online consumer research and database marketing
company in New York. "If you think of the Internet as a broadcast
medium only, you are missing its potential - which is, you can treat
every one of your customers as individuals. If you can get one-on-one
with your customer, and involve them in the marketing plan, you have a
much better chance of meeting their needs."
      In addition to providing specific icons which relate to
products, another way of tailoring information is to allow kids to
select whether they want to receive e-mail on a particular product
line or new product launches, and by doing so, allow them to create
their own personal marketing channel between themselves and the
company.  And if you market your products globally, as LEGO does,
there are several other considerations in designing a Web site.
      Designers at LEGO had to grapple with which language to use,
American or British English, (the company decided on American English)
and how to design icons that would have universal appeal.

212/804-1170)

Working the Web
1. Don't assume that demographic data gathered from your Web site is
representative of your entire customer base. 
One way to validate the data collected online is to hold traditional
focus groups, and compare the results.
2. Always pre-test the Web site on kids to solicit feedback, and to
make sure it has been designed with their needs and abilities in mind.
3. Try to establish early on what type of computers most of the kids
are using to visit your Web site. Though kids generally demand lots of
graphics on the Web, if their computers can't handle intensive
graphics, the site may download and function too slowly to retain
their interest.
4. Take advantage of the electronic medium to change, and refresh your
site often - kids change fast, and your Web site should keep pace.    
5.  Additionally, marketers who create online or Internet sites for
children should become familiar with the advertising guidelines set 
forth by the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council
of Better Business Bureaus.

CONGRESSIONAL HEARING TARGETS DIRECT-MAIL KIDS LISTS

      Marketers targeting kids 16 and under through direct mail,
beware: the first congressional hearing was held last month in
Washington D.C., on a bill which could affect how direct marketers do
business.
      The bill, which was first introduced several months ago, seeks
to prohibit the sale, distribution or rental of lists that contain
private information about kids without parental permission.
      Proponents of the bills say it will protect children by
preventing others from using information gathered from lists to harm
them.  Direct marketing executives support some elements of the bill -
such as a ban on the use of prison labor to process information about
kids - but contend that if the bill is passed, the direct marketing
industry will be dramatically impacted, and so will kids - who
currently receive direct mail on a wide variety of products. Congress
adjourned without taking action on the bill, and marketers will be
watching when Congress convenes again to see if the legislation is
reintroduced. (Direct Marketing Association, 202/955-5030)

NINTENDO 64 SELLS OUT

      Nintendo of America, whose marketing strategies for the highly
awaited Nintendo 64 gaming system were criticized by software
retailers and questioned by analysts, is celebrating a nationwide
sellout of the 350,000 consoles that hit retail Sept. 29. 
      The supply of the 3-D system disappeared after three days, with
more than 50 percent of the units pre-sold before the official launch
date. Executives at Redmond, Wash.-based Nintendo will send small
shipments of 430,000 consoles and an undisclosed number of games to
retailers starting this week. 
      The overwhelmingly positive buzz on Nintendo 64 worried major
software outlets such as Funco Inc., which complained that the
company's low supply of consoles would leave them empty-handed during
the busiest shopping season of the year (see S2K, Sept. 18).
Nintendo's decision to release just two titles in support of the
system raised further questions about the company's market sense.
Consumer demand for the games mirrored their desire for the console.
Super Mario 64 sold at a 1:1 ratio with Nintendo 64, and consumers
purchased one copy of PilotWings 64 for every four consoles sold,
according to Nintendo. (Nintendo of America, 206/882-2040)

KIDS SHOULD REGISTER HIGH IN SUPER-MARKETING

      Kids love an outing to the supermarket - on average, kids ages 6
to 14 go food shopping about once a week -  and when they go, they are
likely to go with their parents, and influence the purchases that are
made.
      That is the conclusion of recent data collected by Simmons
Market Research in their "1995 Kids Study."  The study surveyed 2,118
kids on whether and how often they went grocery shopping, whether they
actually selected items to purchase, and the products in which they
were considered the "expert" in their family.
      Marketers should consider actually observing kids in the
supermarket to understand their purchasing behavior.
      Kids selected approximately five items per shopping trip -
though 11% of 9- to 11-year-olds picked 10 or more items.
      And when the kids are pulling products off the shelves, they are
most likely to pick breakfast cereals, candy and gum, and cookies -
the top three categories kids picked from a list of 29 food products.
      "You've got to watch the environment in which the purchasing
occurs," said Dr. Langbourne Rust, marketing consultant and consumer
psychologist specializing in kids. "Focus groups force thought to a
much higher level, but the challenge is to see how kids think when
they aren't [forced]."
      The supermarket and convenience store is a place where  kids'
marketers can find success - if they understand the many simultaneous
factors that characterize kids purchasing behavior there. It's one of
kids most favorite destinations to make purchases in (perhaps because
so many products there are actually within their budget). According to
a report sponsored by Kurt Salmon & Associates, Discount Merchandiser,
and Lisa Frank, Inc.,  kids ages 8 to 12 spent $378 annually on fast
food, groceries, snacks, candy and other food products. The 13- to
17-year-old-group spent $633 - and the majority of those purchases
took place in either the convenience or grocery store.  
      According to the Simmons study,  54% of kids ages 6 to 8, 48% of
9- to 11-year-olds, and 39% of 12- to 14-year-olds are considered the
expert in their family when it comes to breakfast cereals - not
surprising, since 90% of  American households have several varieties
of cereal in their homes at one time.  
      How do the cereal companies, and others attract kids' attention
while shopping in the supermarket?  
Rust suggests a number of approaches:
      * Directing information to the child sitting in the shopping
cart;
      * Displaying products at cart height;
      *  Designing packaging that encourages and supports children
physically interacting with it; 
      * Selecting product names carefully, so children can pronounce
them, and mothers can interact with their children (packaging with
distinctive colors, shapes and animals are good catalysts for mothers
to talk to their kids about the product); 
      * Not relying on too much text on the product's packaging for
younger kids; and 
      * Using age-appropriate text for the older set.
If you can get the kids to notice your product from furtheraway, that
works, too, said Rust. Or, once kids approach the cereal aisle, for
example, distinguish your product by adding a kid-friendly feature,
such as a handle on the box, which is perceived as an added-value
feature. Candy companies do this when they package candy in a baseball
helmet or truck. The kids perceive the toy as added value.
 Marketers are not only targeting kids, they are also trying to keep
one step ahead of all of the other cereal, candy, and cookie marketers
on the shelves.
      So, try watching what the winners are doing - and then do just
the opposite.
      "It's a question of becoming distinctive, and it is enormously
complex and subtle," said Rust. "As soon as a marketing approach
becomes formulaic, the [marketer] that wins is the one that breaks the
formula." 
(Stan Simon, Simmons Market Research, 212/373-8900; Langbourne Rust,
914/769-3113)

FROM WALL STREET TO THE CLASS BEAT

     It's a product recognized around the world, though most closely
associated with board rooms, not homerooms.
Bringing the Wall Street Journal into classrooms was not an easy
assignment for Melinda Patterson Grenier, editor and publisher of  the
6-yearold The Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition. Grenier sought to
change kids' image of the Journal, and faced a complex marketing
challenge: how to market a product perceived by kids as being for
adults only.
     The goal was to see if the company could find a way to make the
product more teen-friendly, and penetrate the classroom market around
the country. This would not only serve an educational mission, but
begin building brand loyalty to The Wall Street Journal. 
     The Wall Street Journal Classroom Edition is targeted to high
school student from ages 14 to 18, though gifted kids in the fifth and
sixth grades ages 10 and 11 are also reading it. The classroom edition
consists of a set of 30 copies of the newspaper per classroom, a
20-page teacher's guide, and a free poster set, for $165 a year. For
an additional $135 per year, eight videos, which are designed in a
newscast style, supplement the regular subscription package.
     The company made the product more teen friendly - by not changing
a word of copy, illustrating an important concept that many marketers
miss.
     "Kids care about the same things as adults do - jobs, money,
politics," said  Grenier. "They are sophisticated, and they don't want
to be talked down to. And you cannot go wrong by having higher
expectations for kids."
     What the publishers did do was to talk extensively with kids, and
teachers - who needed to be sold on the program - and found out how
the kids perceived the brand, and how that perception could be
changed, without compromising the editorial quality associated with
The Wall Street Journal.
     The Classroom Edition reaches about 600,000 kids per month. In
'91-'92, the Edition was in 1,200 high schools. In '96-'97, it is in
4,000 high schools, or 16% of the high schools in the U.S. Not quite
as many readers as The Journal, which boasts a circulation of 1.8
million.
     Grenier, a former school teacher and reporter for The Wall Street
Journal, took the suggestions of kids and teachers, put together a
16-page black-and-white prototype, and took it on the road to
inner-city high schools in cities like Detroit, and elite high schools
throughout Illinois.        
     She listened to what the kids had to say, and followed a
successful marketing research formula: though clearly the expert in
her product, Grenier recognized the kids as experts in the
marketplace, that is, they know all about what kids want.  The teens
had specific requests: they wanted color in the publication, a page on
politics and policy, a page that would cover careers, and more case
studies and marketing stories.  All these suggestions have been
incorporated into the product. 
     When she handed out the prototype, which contained an article
about a Tom Cruise movie and a story about McDonald's,  the kids loved
the product, and thought it was written specifically for them.
     In fact, the articles were exact reprints of those which had
originally appeared in The Wall Street Journal, though by repackaging
them according to content that would interest kids,  a kid-friendly
product was launched.  
     The publisher realized early on that in order for the product to
be successfully marketed to kids, the teachers in the classroom - who
would ultimately be the ones to purchase the product - would also have
to be included in the marketing and product development process, and
beyond.
     A teacher's advisory board was formed, to advise the publisher on
the selection of articles. This last point is crucial, because the
product not only had to appeal to kids, but had to fit into the school
curriculum and satisfy teachers. A Web site
(http://info.WSJ.com/classroom/) was also created, with two icons, one
for teachers and one for students. (M. Grenier, 609/520-4266 and S.
Russell, 609/520-4298)

ADVERTISING IN THE CLASSROOM EDITION

     The Classroom Edition has signed on several large corporate
advertisers, companies who either have an interest in marketing
directly to kids, such as Apple Computer, Inc., or companies such as
Merrill Lynch & Co, who say that teaching kids about saving and
finance is a part of their corporate mission.
     "We feel it's important to instill good savings habits in kids,
and we are hoping to create an awareness of this issue similar to the
recycling campaign of the '80s," said Christine Cooke, vice president
and manager of educational services, Merrill Lynch. "If they come to
Merrill Lynch down the road, that's nice, but we are doing this as a
community service."
     Other advertisers include International Paper Co., Texas
Instruments, Inc., Stanley Kaplan, and the Dreyfus Corp.  
     Advertisers have the option of taking out ads for an academic
quarter,  a semester, a full year, or sponsoring posters, special
inserts, or even purchasing buttons on the Web.
     A full page black-and-white ad costs $14,850. Sponsorship of a
poster is $30,000. A button on the Web is $1,500 a month, and an ad in
the teacher's guide is $5,000 per page. A black-and-white ad in The
Wall Street Journal could run upwards of $100,000.  
     Advertisers need to realize that kids represent a media-savvy
generation now. "What we are finding is that kids do not resent being
advertised to - they resent being lied to, or being talked down to,"
said Steve Russell, advertising sales manager for Classroom Edition. 
"The lesson is, you better talk straight to them, or you're done." 
     Grenier agrees that kids love learning about companies, enjoy
being consumers, and therefore enjoy the whole product - editorial and
advertising - but warns that kids today have a wider interest range. 
"There's got to be something in it just for them," says Grenier. "They
are not going to read it just because it says The Wall Street
Journal."

CHILDREN'S TELEVISION WORKSHOP, CBS SIGN PROGRAMMING DEAL

     Companies that can look beyond their individual marketing
philosophy - and focus on the larger picture - may find that a merger
can bring them new markets or add a new slant to their brand's image.
     That is one marketing message behind the recent deal between CBS
Entertainment and Children's Television Workshop (CTW), in which CTW
will develop at least three half-hour series for the network's
Saturday morning line-up.
     The first half-hour show, targeted at 6- to 11-year-olds, is
slated to appear in Fall '97.
     CTW, which has built a reputation as the leader in children's
television programming with an educational flavor ("Sesame Street,"
"The Electric Company"), has typically chosen its corporate sponsors
and directed its  marketing initiatives carefully.
     "We are very careful how we market ourselves to kids," said
Allyson Kossow Felix, vice president of marketing and communications,
CTW, based in New York. "In the pre-school arena, we don't sell
directly to kids, and we don't let our own characters promote
products. And we would never team up with an alcohol or tobacco
company."
     For its part, CBS has initiated a drive to offer at least two
hours of children's educational programming on its Saturday morning
line-up. This initiative comes after the Federal Communications
Commission has pursued the networks to try and mandate a required
minimum of hours for educational programming. The FCC has suggested
that in 1998, three hours of educational programming per week be
required of the networks.
     Independently of the CTW shows,  CBS is rolling out two new shows
with educational content for '96-'97:  Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's
Haunted House" and "Bailey Kipper's P.O.V." Additionally, two existing
educationally-oriented shows, "Beakman's World" and "Storybreak" will
return to the line-up.  In addition to the two hours of educational
programming, CBS offers such kids' shows as "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles,"  "The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat" and "The Lion King's
Timon and Pumbaa."
     Yet CBS maintains it is already careful about the advertisements
that appear on Saturday morning programming, which is generally
limited to cereals and toys. 
     "Unless a corporation decides to embrace educational TV as a
corporate mission, we will probably not attract new advertisers," said
Michael Nowacki, vice-president of daytime and children's sales, CBS.
"There is very little image-driven advertising or image selling to
kids. It is mostly product driven."
     CTW has previously and successfully entered into agreements with
other commercial networks - they currently have an hour-long cartoon
show running on the Cartoon Network called "Big Bag", and another
show, "Ghostwriter," a literacy-based program, which appears in
syndication - and insists that entering into the commercial domain
presents them with new marketing opportunities.
     "I think, first and foremost, [the deal] goes right to CTW's
corporate mission, which is to be where kids are, and this means that
more kids will get to see our programming," said Kossow Felix. 
     Though CTW's preschool programming on public television is
commercially uninterrupted, and the new shows on CBS will contain
commercials, CTW maintains that older children can distinguish between
programming and commercials. 
     CTW says that young viewers will not be confused by a
CTW-produced show on a commercial network because children don't
necessarily distinguish which network is providing the programming
they enjoy.
     And as long as two disparate companies marketing a product
together have a commitment to maintaining the integrity of the
product, there should be no marketing obstacles.
     "Kids don't perceive our programming as 'spinach television,' "
says Kossow Felix. "Kids are attracted to great programming, and are
going to watch what they like. We are already on cable, PBS, the
commercial networks, we have magazines and we're online. We have a
home video relationship with Sony.  We live in the commercial world.
We  recognize the power of our combined partnership."

PBS BECOMES ADVENTUROUS AND 'VIRTUOUS' IN PRIME TIME

     With animated shows like "X-Men" and "Bugs Bunny" catching kids'
fancy, how might a show about virtues fare among pint-sized viewers
and potential commercial partners? 
     The Public Broadcasting System, based in Alexandria, Va., is
banking on the success of its first animated primetime series,
"Adventures from the Book of Virtues." It has already secured some
potentially lucrative merchandising and promotional deals and looks to
be positioning the animated series near the top of its programming
roster.
     The primetime series premiere which aired in early September is
adapted stories from The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral
Stories ($27.50), a New York Times bestseller written in 1993 by
William Bennett.  
     Porchlight Entertainment, the producers of the series, went
full-force with the PBS product, bringing in a number of marketing and
distribution partners including Reader's Digest, Turner Home
Entertainment and Warner Resound.  This series is the largest project
that the upstart Porchlight has launched. Other Porchliht projects
include the Family Channel original "Night of the Twisters."
     "We have approached this as a major programming event," said
William Baumann, executive vice president and CFO of the Los
Angeles-based Porchlight.  The partnership-wide launch, advertising
and promotion of the series will exceed $10 million during 1996 and
1997.    
     PBS owns the home video, audio and visual rights and the rights
to promote the series.  
     The marketing push, which began nine months in advance of the
premiere, is aimed at both parents and children.  Parents, who may be
familiar with Bennett's book, expect to recognize the show's moral and
educational content.  And the show's animated characters should
attract kids, according to Baumann.
     Six episodes aired this year over the Labor Day weekend and will
air again on Thanksgiving afternoon.  Seven new episodes will premier
in January 1997 and an additional 13 to 26 episodes are expected for
1997 and beyond. The show airs at 8 p.m. in most U.S. locations.
     Philadelphia-based healthcare CIGNA Corporation, sponsors the
series, filling a 15-second advertising slot before and after each
episode.
     A major consumer product push starting in early 1997 will include
story books, coloring books, posters, magnets, activity kits, learning
toys and a series of home videos related to the PBS series. 
Initially, approximately 8,000 independent Christian bookstores,
members of the Christian Bookstore Association have secured exclusive
rights to sell the products through the Christmas season.  This
exclusive retail opportunity was part of the deal between Warner
Resound, a recognized Christian distributor, and Turner Home
Entertainment.  The products will find mainstream retailers in late
January 1997. 
     Turner recently aired an infomercial on cable to promote a series
of 13 home videos produced by Porchlight.  A series of 12 story books
from Simon & Schuster, the publishers of Bennett's book, will relate
to characters and events in the series.  
     Hamilton Projects, a New York-based licensing and merchandising
agency, contacted major toy manufactures such as Hasbro Inc., Mattel,
Playmates and Tyco to manufacture toys, board games, electronic
learning toys and activity kits related to the series. No deals,
however, have been inked. 
     Products will achieve considerable success in the Christian
market because the show's moral content appeals to Christian
consumers, according to Joanne Loria, senior vice president at
Hamilton. 
     The major element of the series' publicity campaign, led by
senior vice president Michael Gerrety of New York-based Hanson &
Schwam Public Relations, was to "make [the show] appealing to families
and children without making it too `kiddy.' "  Gerrety concedes that
you cannot sell virtues to children. "The virtue and moral aspects of
the show are included in the entertainment," he says.  
     Reader's Digest, making use of its vast household readership,
will promote the show to a select group of consumers through a direct
mail campaign.  
     PBS will move the series from prime time to Sunday mornings
during the spring of 1997 and the first 13 episodes will run in a
weekly cycle.  
     The first show, airing on 30 of the 33 PBS stations, managed a
1.9 rating/3 share according to PBS.  Each rating point represents a
percentage of television households that tuned in to "Adventures."
     To keep parents and children abreast of the show's developments,
a World Wide Web page has been created for the series
(http://www.pbs.org/adventures). Porchlight received 500 e-mail
responses since the Sept. 2 premiere and Web site hits exceeded
300,000.
     Bennett told Selling to Kids that royalties related to the series
were insignificant compared to his royalties from the licity campaign,
led by senior vice president Michael Gerrety of New ork-based Hanson &
Schwam Public Relations, was to "make [the show] appealing to families
and children without making it too `kiddy.' "  Gerrety concedes that
you cannot sell virtues to children. "The virtue and moral aspects of

     Bennett told Selling to Kids that royalties related to the series
were insignificant compared to his royalties from the book.  The Book
of Virtues remains on the bestseller list after more than 100 weeks,
selling over 4 million copies and generating $110 million in sales.

VSDA TO SPONSOR LOCAL TRADE SHOWS, STIRRING FLAP WITH REGIONAL
CHAPTERS

     The national management of VSDA may have headed off a
serious rebellion among its regional chapter presidents at a
meeting in Las Vegas after the Winter Consumer Electronics Show.
Some retailers were voicing anger at the VSDA for its recent
announcement that the trade group will sponsor its own local
shows--potentially cutting off chapters from a growing revenue
source.
     A letter from VSDA President Lou Berg to chapter presidents
suggested that the locals "discontinue trade shows that are
independently sponsored by the regional chapters."  But another
letter, coming from regional president Tom Daugherty of the
Spokane, WA chapter before the meeting, says that to stop local
retailers from sponsoring shows is to do them "a total
disservice."
     VSDA officials claim locals can still mount small
exhibitions as long as they're not called "trade shows," and they
don't charge more than $100 per table for member companies to
exhibit.  Executive vice president Pam Horowitz says the regional
chapters approached the national association and asked for VSDA
"to take an active role in the organization of their shows.  Many
shows have become too large for regional chapters to handle
alone."
     Connecticut Chapter President Ron Maslowski said before the
Las Vegas meeting that "there's discontent all over the country"
over the VSDA announcement.  "We had (a trade show) scheduled for
March, and they told us in no uncertain terms to cancel it.  They
like the big shebang to be (the national convention in) Vegas,
and the movie studios now could be pulling back their money if
there are too many of these local shows, so they made this move.
But we would have all the small people at our show, the local
candy dealers and local label dealers.  If they can't come to a
local show, where can they go?  They sure aren't going to go all
the way out to Vegas."
     Maslowski claims "we've had membership drop off because
they're disillusioned.  They feel (VSDA) is for the big guy now."
But after the Las Vegas showdown, Los Angeles chapter President
Fina Damian says "everything was discussed and everyone was in
agreement.  At first, they thought it was just going to be the
four shows (announced by VSDA), but the locals found out
otherwise."
     "I hear there will be eight to 10 shows next year, and the
cities will rotate," says San Diego Chapter President Howard
Bregstein.  "The money is going for a justifiable cause--into the
national treasury to fight legal and legislative issues."  VSDA
officials say the money they take in from the five local shows
(in Sparks, NV Feb. 26-27; Toronto Apr. 29-30; Chicago May 13-14;
Atlanta June 12-13 and Austin, TX Nov. 13-14) will go back to the
chapters.

STUDIO PRINT CATALOGS PROMOTE SOME TITLES WHILE SELLING
MERCHANDISE

     With such products as a chess set whose men are all Looney
Tunes characters ($495) and "Star Trek" coffee mugs whose
characters "beam up" as you add hot coffee ($12), merchandise
catalogs from studios have become a profitable cottage industry.
Studios such as Warner and Paramount promote their catalogs
actively.  But even studios which don't have major catalogs offer
some collectibles through mail, at least through licensing deals.
     There are occasionally products that tie-in directly to
videocassette titles, but the rule is more often to offer generic
studio merchandise or memorabilia connected to a current (or
upcoming) theatrical release.  Sometimes the failure to provide
video offerings is based on a lack of communication between video
and theatrical divisions; other times, management doesn't see a
particular video-related offer as important.
     Lorraine Brodek, director of consumer products for Warner
Bros., says her company doesn't specifically try to promote video
with its catalog, but it doesn't rule out the possibility,
either.  "We don't coordinate with videos generally, but we do
have "Lethal Weapon 2" product and "Batman" product listed in the
catalog.  Many times, public demand will dictate which titles
have merchandise tied-in."
     Warner has promoted its catalog on rental cassettes, but
must walk a thin line to avoid upsetting some retailers who see
direct-response pitches as competitive.  An animated spot shows
Daffy Duck walking the backlot at Warner Studios and urging
viewers to call for the catalog featuring Looney Tunes
merchandise and other Warner tie-ins.  Brodek says there has been
"very strong response" to the on-cassette ads, but that much of
the time, the interest is more in the Warner logo product than in
any specific title-based merchandise.
     At other studios, the emphasis shifts a bit.  Paramount, for
example, offered "White Christmas" tie-ins in its holiday
catalog, as well as boxed sets of such cassette series as "Star
Trek", "Friday the 13th" and "Pee Wee's Playhouse" (not to
mention the "Star Trek" MasterCard or "Friday the 13th"
Spitballs).
     MGM/UA tells VMN it's now updating its catalog, and that
some video titles may be included in the marketing promotions.
Even if a video title is listed in the catalog, the merchandise
may be left over from a promotion done when the film was in
theaters.
     "It's not necessary to think of it as a video title or a
theatrical title; it's more a question of whether the title will
have the kind of following necessary to create a demand for the
merchandise," says Brodek.  "The catalog is meant less as an
attempt to promote the titles and more as an attempt to sell the
items we have listed.  We're targeting the customer who will be
interested in our products, so we keep the title above all else
in mind.  It doesn't matter if it's on video or in theaters."

TOP 100 LIST SHOWS BEST-SELLERS at $2.7 BILLION, With 170-MILLION
UNITS SOLD

     VIDEO MARKETING NEWSLETTER's annual chart of the top 100
best-selling prerecorded videocassettes of all time (see chart,
p. 4) dramatizes the overwhelming influence of sellthrough on the
home video market.  By Dec. 31, 1989, the list accounted for 170
million units sold, an increase of 85% over last year's 92
million.  And dollar volume, estimated at $2.751-billion for the
107 titles on this year's list, was up 69% over the 105 titles on
last year's list.  (There are more than 100 titles on the chart
because several titles tied at the cut-off point, 500,000 units.)
     Last year, only 59 titles sold over 500,000 units, but by
the end of 1989, all 107 titles on this year's list had done so.
In fact, the top 36 titles on this year's list sold over one
million copies, a feat accomplished by only 18 titles last year.
The top 10 titles accounted for 46% of the chart's total unit
sales, and 38% of total factory dollars, as estimated by VMN.
     But the impact of sellthrough pricing was clear, as the
average factory price of a cassette plummeted from $21.22 last
year to $16.19 this year, a 24% slump.  That drop compares to 10%
in 1988 and 9% in 1987.
     Two studios, Disney and Paramount, accounted for 56 of the
top 107 titles.  Disney/Touchstone alone racked up more than
$900-million in estimated revenue from the titles on the chart,
and itself accounted for a full third of the total revenue earned
by charted titles.

     Noteworthy from this year's chart:
     For the first time in history, no non-theatrical title made
the cumulative top 20 list.
     The list is heavily peppered with short children's titles,
accounting for much of Disney's strength.
     The industry's maturity is obvious--as only 16 titles
released in 1989 were strong enough to muscle their way onto the
list.  Many evergreen titles scored substantial sales gain in
1989, notably a re-released "Wizard of Oz" shipping more than 3
million new units last year.
     Only a handful of top titles came from companies not linked
to the seven major studios: Orion, IVE (Family Home
Entertainment), Western Publishing, Parker Bros., Video Reel (in
bankruptcy) and Vestron (for sale).  Companies which are not a
major studio or a mini-major, or a toy company, have had little
luck in making the list.
     When the chart first appeared, covering the period through
1985, unit cut-off for the Top 100 was 110,000 units.  Four years
later, the cut-off is more than four times that, up 30% from last
year, and 53% from the 1987 chart.  List prices given are highest
since initial release, but in estimating studio revenue, VMN has
taken re-pricing into account.

MONTGOMERY WARD TO STOCK LASERDISC SOFTWARE; SEARS SAYS NOT YET

     There seems to be some confusion over whether the Montgomery
Ward company is going to be test marketing laserdisc software in
up to 50 stores next month. Pioneer LDCA announced that
Montgomery Ward would be stocking laser software in 44 of its
stores, but a spokesman for Ward reports that the company "has
been asked to consider carrying laserdisc software, but no
decision has been made yet."
     A representative of Video Channels, the Pittsburgh-based
rackjobber which supplies both Ward and Sears, says "it's up to
the companies to announce" their plans, but confirmed that some
laserdisc product had been ordered by Ward for stocking by
mid-February.
     If it does stock laserdiscs, Ward would be the first mass
market retailer to offer the software, although hardware from
Pioneer and other companies has been in place at Sears, JC Penney
and other stores for some time.  It could mean another step in
the ongoing effort of laserdisc to be a mass market consumer
product.
     The Video Channels representative could not confirm rumors
that Sears was about to follow Ward's into the laserdisc
business.  A spokesman for Sears said the world's biggest
retailer is "currently stocking Pioneer hardware, but not the
software, and we have no plans at this point" to start selling
disc movies.

RITE AID BACKS OUT OF VIDEO RENTAL, BLAMING LACK OF SPACE

     The country's largest drug chain, Rite Aid (Shiremanstown,
PA) is exiting the video rental business because it invites too
much cutthroat competition and takes up too much store space,
according to a company spokesman.  All this has led to a severe
decline in profits in the 950 stores in which the chain rented
software. Rite Aid operates 2,400 stores in the eastern half of
the country.
     According to the spokesman, the company will take a pretax
write off of $22-million in the third quarter on its video rental
departments.  He says that supermarkets, mass merchants and other
competitors are offering video in more space and with more
breadth than Rite Aid can afford.  It will continue to offer
sellthrough titles.
     The 1.5-million tapes in Rite Aid's inventory will be sold
to consumers at $12.99 each, according to the spokesman.  He says
the rental business seemed like a better idea in 1985, when Rite
Aid entered it, than it does today, particularly since the
average specialty store devotes more than 5,000 square feet to
rental inventory, while the average Rite Aid store encompasses
only 6,700 square feet in its entirety.  Only a few hundred feet
went to video rental.

MEDIA SIGNS AGREEMENTS WITH HANDLEMAN, VIACOM AND WEST COAST

     Media Home Entertainment has been busily shoring up its
operations, signing separate agreements with Handleman Co. to
distribute and market the company's sell-through catalog, with
Viacom, for Media to market releases from Viacom Pictures and
with West Coast Video Duplicating to buy Media's Culver City
duplicating facilities and to manufacture all Media's product for
five years.
     The moves were made "to focus on our primary business,
product acquisition and distribution," according to Glenn Greene,
Media president/CEO.  The three-year deal with Handleman, the
Troy, MI-based rackjobber, covers more than 1,500 titles, ranging
in suggested retail price from $9.95 to $19.95.  Included in the
agreement are Hi-Tops titles, NFL sports programs and Kathy Smith
exercise videos.
     Viacom's agreement calls for a minimum of nine and a maximum
of 18 features to be released theatrically by Viacom and marketed
to home video by Media during 1990 and 1991.  Among the first
titles under the agreement is a thriller called "Fourth Story,"
about to go into production.  Greene says the deal with Viacom
shows Media "gearing up to maintain its position as the major
independent player in the industry."
     A Media warehouse in Valencia, CA, as well as all
duplicating equipment, will be taken over by West Coast, which
will retain all duplication employees.

     *Buena Vista Home Video will test a "field-damaged cassette

     *Buena Vista Home Video will test a "field-damaged cassette
replacement program" for all rental titles starting with the
release of "Turner & Hooch" and "New York Stories."  In the six-
month trial, damaged cassettes are returned to the supplier
without packaging and replaced for $8 plus shipping.  Cassettes
can only be returned within eight weeks of a title's release.
According to Buena Vista, the defective rate from the
manufacturer is only 0.3 percent, but cassettes can become
defective after shipping.  The company will share test data with
VSDA and NAVD.
     Kenneth Ross has been appointed president and CEO of newly-
formed Picture Music America, which will produce and market home
video product for Capitol/EMI.  The company will produce original
music-based programs for broadcast and cable, as well as home
video.  Ross has served as vice president of video at
CBS/Broadcast Group and director of non-theatrical, music and
sports programming at CBS/Fox.
     A study released by Cambridge Associates (Stamford, CT)
predicts that special-interest revenues will increase from $325
million in 1989 to $420 million this year.  The bulk of the
increase will go to direct mail houses, direct response TV sales
(on cable shopping channels or with 800 and 900 services) and
other non-retail outlets.  Cambridge estimates direct response
will account for more than one-third of all special interest
volume.  Supermarkets, which increased their market share 6% in
1989, are the only retail outlets expected to increase market
share in 1990.
     New Line Cinema has become the ninth studio to sign a long-
term contract with Request Television, the New York-based pay-
per-view service.  The contract begins with the Feb. 20 showing
of "Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child," and will include
"Heart Condition," the soon-to-be-released action comedy with Bob
Hoskins and Denzel Washington, among other titles.  Request's two
pay-per-view systems were launched in 1985 and 1988.
     LIVE Entertainment Inc. has acquired the Waxie Maxie retail
chain, a 33-store operation based in the Baltimore-Washington
D.C. area, and the 87-store Strawberries chain, which operates in
the Northeast from Maine to Pennsylvania. The Waxie Maxie deal
was reportedly worth about $11.8-million.
     Bookselling giant B. Dalton, which dropped the sale of
videocassettes after a disappointing first run, now says it is
"very pleased" with the results of a 50-store market test and is
expected to re-enter the business.  B. Dalton gave up on video
sales in 1987 after experiencing unusually high pilferage.  A
company spokesman says the test, which includes over 200
childrens, how-to and low-priced theatrical titles, will be
expanded to other markets, though "its not 100% certain" that all
B. Dalton stores will be carrying video.
     "Batman" is considered by most as primarily a sellthrough
item, but Alexander & Associates reports the movie has set new
records as a rental title.  According to A&A, the caped crusader
was rented 9.8 million times in its first two weeks and 11.6
million times in the first three weeks.  That makes "Batman" the
biggest-renting title ever, beating out "E.T.--The
Extraterrestrial" by more than 3 million rentals in the first
two-week period.
     SBI Video, a Lanham, MD-based distributor, is joining with
MCA Home Video to promote "Uncle Buck" and future MCA titles with
a retailer promotion called "Buck Bucks."  Retailers earn five
points for each selected MCA title shipped starting with "Uncle
Buck" and ending June 30.  Prizes range from a MCA/SBI sweatshirt
for 75 points to a Samsung camcorder for 5,000 points.  Retailers
must submit their invoices between June 30 and July 31 to claim
prizes.
     L.A.-based Wood Knapp & Co., has purchased the video catalog
of Eastman Kodak, which includes 135 special interest and 26
travel, photography and how-to titles.  Kodak's most successful
titles were "Bill Cosby: 49," which sold more than 350,000
copies, and "Yo Yo Man," with Tom Smothers (about 150,000
copies).
     There may be a fight brewing between MPI Home Video and MCA
Home Video.  A spokesman for MCA says MPI's recently released
cassette, "Images of the 80's," contains footage from MCA
releases which were not licensed to MPI.  As of our presstime,
both companies were unavailable for comment.

NEW WORLD PINK-SLIPS STAFF AND SELLS EXISTING CATALOG...THE FATE
OF INDEPENDENTS?

     New World Video and its sister company, New World Pictures,
were sold shortly before the end of 1989 to Trans Atlantic Video,
according to sources within the disbanding company.  New World
issued pink slips to its remaining staff this month. There are no
plans for the company to continue distributing product
domestically.
     New World was sold to the Andrews Group in 1988, and
negotiations to sell it again began months later.  Video staff
had been pared down to a handful by the time Trans Atlantic Video
bought the company in late December.  There were no immediate
announcements about the distribution of New World titles already
on the market, such as "Heathers," "Godzilla 1985" and "Lust in
the Dust."
     "We've been in limbo for over six months," said one New
World executive. "The bad side is that you hate to walk away from
something that used to be good, but the good side is that we had
a long time to prepare for it." When the company was "healthy and
strong," the executive says, "there were 25 or 30 employees
altogether."  When the deal was consummated, there were six.  The
New World demise reiterates the difficulties independent
suppliers are having finding worthy titles and shelf space, and
some independents are starting to wonder privately whether anyone
but the major studios will survive the '90s.

EUROPE SELLTHROUGH GIVING THEATRICAL EXHIBITION A RUN FOR THE
MONEY

     The European home video market is out-grossing theatrical
films by as much as 40%, according to a survey done in Great
Britain.  Screen Digest, an international cinema newsletter, says
about $4 billion is being spent on home video in the 18 largest
European nations, as opposed to about $2.9 billion being spent in
local movie houses.  The biggest video market is in England,
where about $1.3-billion is being spent on video, compared with
the $308 million Daily Variety estimates Britons are spending at
the box office.  Sellthrough is seen as the most significant
factor in the surge, as rental has grown by about 5-10% in the
U.K. while sellthrough has doubled in each of the past four
years.

CAMCORDER USERS GET A TASTE OF HOLLYWOOD: STEADICAM JR. FOR SMALL
SIZES

     A low-end version of Steadicam, the Academy Award-winning
invention that steadies a hand-held camera to eliminate bumps and
jumps, is now being marketed for the home video movie enthusiast.
Steadicam, Jr., a hand-held apparatus that attaches to the bottom
of a VHS-C or 8mm camcorder, has been introduced by Cinema
Products Corp., the company that developed and sells the original
professional model.
     The camcorder version, which weighs less than two pounds,
attaches to the bottom of the camcorder, and includes a view
screen on the front of the unit that eliminates the need for the
eyepiece.  A 3.5-inch LCD screen shows the camera operator the
view being recorded by the unit.  The Steadicam also includes a
low-intensity light that attaches to the back of the camera.
     There are no plans to make a Steadicam for full-size
camcorders, since the added weight of such a unit makes the
operation of a Steadicam impossible. Steadicam, Jr. lists for
$549.  The company's Jac Holzman says the initial market for the
product will be semi-professionals, using the unit at weddings
and other events.  It will be available first quarter this year.
     But the key to the presentation is steadiness. After some
practice, the company's chairman Jac Holzman says, any operator
can handle the Steadicam easily, and the camera "floats," using a
series of weights and balances. Basically a smaller version of
the $40,000 professional version, Steadicam, Jr. is a system of
distributed mass and balances, with the center of gravity
precisely placed above the floating inter-gimballed handle
assembly. The handle, placed below the body of the camera, allows
the operator to run or move with the action without bouncing the
camera or the image it records, Holzman says.

PARAMOUNT'S KLINGENSMITH SEES PPV GAINING WHERE HOME VIDEO
RECEDES
     Speaking at a pay-per-view convference in Anaheim last
month, Paramount Pictures video president Bob Klingensmith said a
Harvard Business School survey commissioned by Paramount predicts
pay-per-view will increase its market share while home video
begins to fade.
     Klingensmith went on to say that PPV is central to the
future of movie studios in general, and that it should be a
priority among all film companies "if we're going to continue to
make bigger movies with bigger stars." He compared the double
digit inflation of filmmaking with the single-digit growth of
markets including home video and said relying on homevid and
other markets and ignoring PPV "won't let us catch up with that
kind of cost rate."
     PPV is expected to increase by 750 percent by 1993,
according to the Paramount president, but he estimates that it
will still be only one-tenth the size of pay-TV and four percent
the size of home video. Klingensmith urged other movie companies
to raise the priority of PPV, suggesting that by 1995, it could
be a $1-billion business for motion pictures alone, discounting
special events and other PPV alternatives. Among the steps he
suggested should be taken to push PPV along were direct mail and
program guides to inform the public, advertising on cable
stations, setting aside preview channels for future use and
pushing to get PPV listed in TV grids. He did not mention any
further drop-off in home video revenues, although the Harvard
survey, which he said was commissioned to get "an unbiased look"
at the alternatives, saw homevid losing ground to PPV in coming
years.    *Australia may be getting pay-TV soon, as a government
committee recently okayed the implementation of such a system.
Still, the Federation of Commercial Television Stations (FCTS)
has called for a delay in cable installation. The introduction of
cable and pay services is seen as the death blow for the
already-reeling broadcast stations.
     *A Polish refugee to the U.S., David Chase is now returning
to his native land to participate in a joint venture with the
Polish government to construct and operate cable systems
throughout the country.  PTK Enterprises has been granted a
20-year franchise from the Polish government to establish a
nationwide service, and will enjoy exclusive rights in Polish
cities for five years. American stations hoping to hit the Polish
airwaves include CNN, ESPN and MTV.
     *Britons may be seeing a new commercial channel soon, and a
bill before Parliament would allow Channel Four, the latest in
the BBC's stable, to start running ads. The bill, introduced in
December, is expected to start a legislative battle royale. On
the plus side for the bill: the public is demanding a wider range
of stations. But the down side: politicians don't favor the idea
of government-owned stations showing commercials.
     *The Paris Metro is no longer running subway television. At
least temporarily, the cable system running in subway stations is
disbanding, as the company running it, Transcommunication, is
dizzolving. The station's 1989 losses were estimated at 15
million francs, or about $2.5-million.
     *Canada has become the first country to send 37 channels of
video across fiber optic cables when CF Cable TV, based in
Montreal, linked two headends in late Fall. The link-up allowed
24,000 subscribers to receive the transmissions, and CF Cable
predicts that when its project is completed this year, more than
one-quarter of its territory will receive the fiber-transmitted
signal, reaching about 55,000 subscribers.

TRANSMISSION ISSUES, CABLE DOMINATE INTERNATIONAL VIDEO ISSUES

     From Great Britain to Poland, from Australia to Belgium,
European and other foreign nations are debating video issues.
Some countries, like England, are considering a change in their
broadcast systems (England recently broadened its signal to
accomodate far more channels), while others are facing the cable
revolution for the first time.  Here's a sampling of the video
news from around the  globe:

COMPANY ANNOUNCED INTENTION TO MARKET VIDEO ON DEMAND BY END OF
1990

     The Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas may--or
may not--have seen the first shot fired in a new technology war
that could conceivably change the entire business of video
software distribution.  A company called Entertainment Made
Convenient 2 (EMC2) Inc. (Denver, CO) says it is ready and
willing to begin transmission of Video On Demand by the end of
this year.     Company co-founder and vice chairman Will Graven
and some investors have put together a plan which would require
the end user to purchase a new VCR and satellite receiver.  Once
the hardware is in place, Graven told a hastily-called CES press
conference, a telephone number is called and an eight-digit code
specifying the program to be sent is punched in.  The video
program is then down-loaded into the VCR via satellite at a rate
approximately 10 times that of real time (a 2-hour movie would be
send in 10 to 20 minutes).
     Graven admitted EMC2 had not yet licensed the technology to
any hardware manufacturer, and that no software studio had signed
on to provide programming.  But he says there are advantages to
both ends of the distribution chain, and he has seen "great
interest" from hardware and software suppliers. "We will be the
electronic video rental store," he says. "The studios we've
talked to have been very interested because above all else, we
offer them security.  Macrovision is built-in, and the tape will
erase itself on the second play.  And we'll pay a royalty on each
and every transaction.  All the program supplier will need is a
PC hooked up to our mainframe." According to Graven, the hardware
manufacturers will find it very simple to add the chips necessary
for his system to existing assembly lines. "It will not require
new assembly lines or new buildings. The S-VHS or 8mm chassis
they're using now will work very well. And the new generation VCR
they make will receive and record digitally."  While it's
possible for manufacturers to build in such now standard VCR
features as record, timeshift and standard playback, Graven says
he expects the first units to be made strictly for the EMC2
system. "Later on, they'll probably add in the other functions."
Initial retail cost for the VCR and satellite receiver (current
satellite users can keep their existing receiver) should be
between $1,200 and $1,500, he estimates.The satellite system
should work even better than proposed fiber optic video delivery
operations now being tested, according to Graven.  "Everybody
says the answer is going to be fiber optics, but very quickly
after you start with fiber optics you have traffic problems."  He
says that the EMC2 system eliminates depth of copy and breadth of
copy as problems because the consumer will never have the system
tell it a title in the catalog is not available.  For consumers
who wish to rent a title, a button can be pushed in the initial
transaction informing the system that the erase function should
not be built into the transmission.  The system will then bill
the consumer for the retail price of the program.  Rental
programs should be "comparable to current rates," says Graven:
about $3 for a current hit, $2 for something from catalog and
$1.50 for a one-hour non-theatrical program. Graven says the
system will be ready to run by late Third Quarter 1990.  Until
hardware and software manufacturers are licensed, however, there
will be no system to start up.  And there has been no indication
from any software or hardware supplier that any agreement is
imminent.  Graven claims to have been negotiating with
manufacturers and studios for two years, but declines to mention
any company names until contracts are signed.

VSDA TO SPONSOR LOCAL SHOWS; REGIONAL CHAPTERS REACT ANGRILY

     Some retailers are voicing anger at the VSDA for its recent
announcement that the trade group will sponsor its own local
shows. Chapter officials say they're being cut out by the parent
organization while VSDA officials say their intention is to do
anything but that.
     Retailers say they're less upset with the sponsorship by
VSDA than they are with the association's suggestion that members
"discontinue trade shows that are independently sponsored by the
regional chapters." VSDA president Lou Berg made that suggestion
in a letter to regional chapter presidents.  Another letter,
coming from regional president Tom Daugherty of the Spokane, WA
chapter, says to stop local retailers from sponsoring shows is to
do them "a total disservice."
     VSDA officials claim members can still hold exhibitions on a
small scale, as long as they're not called "trade shows," and
they don't charge more than $100 per table to exhibit.  Executive
vice president Pam Horovitz says the regional chapters approached
the national association and asked for VSDA "to take an active
role in the organziation of their shows.  Many shows have become
too large for regional chapters to handle alone. Our intention is
to contribute our expertise and professionalism in handling these
shows."
     Connecticut chapter president Ron Maslowski says "there's
discontent all over the country" over the VSDA announcement. "We
had (a trade show) scheduled for March, and they told us in no
uncertain terms to cancel it. They like the big shebang to be
Vegas, and we see the movie studios now could be pulling back
their money if there are too many of these local shows, so they
made this move. But we would have all the small people at our
show, the local candy dealers and local label dealers in the
state. If they can't come to a local show, where can they go?
They sure aren't going to go all the way out to Vegas."
     Maslowski goes on to claim that "we've had membership drop
off because they're disillusioned. They feel (VSDA) is for the
big guy now. It's going to hurt in the long run." VSDA officials
say the money they take in from the five local shows (in Sparks,
NV Feb. 26-27; Toronto Apr. 29-30; Chicago May 13-14; Atlanta
June 12-13 and Austin, TX Nov. 13-14) will go back to the
chapters. Some of the retailers disgruntled with the organization
claim the money is all going to fund the national show in Las
Vegas, Aug. 5-8. xxxx-30-original version,,,
     Some of the retailers disgruntled with the organization
claim the money is all going to fund the national show in Las
Vegas, Aug. 5-8.
     San Diego Chapter President Howard Bregstein tells VMN he
was "pretty upset when I heard" that VSDA national would sponsor
four regional shows this year, and that the organization was
urging its regional chapters to avoid sponsoring their own trade
shows.  But after he voiced his disapproval at the Las Vegas
meeting, Bregstein says, he realized the guidelines set down by
the national association are not as strict as he'd feared.
     "A lot of things were due to a lack of communication," says
Bregstein. "They're not telling you you can't run your own
exhibition; they just don't want you to call it a trade show.  I
think (after the meeting) the national board of VSDA understands
the nature of the regionals a little better."
     Bregstein says he was among those alarmed at the thought
that only four regional shows, in cities chosen by VSDA, would be
held every year.  At the meeting, he says, he found out that was
wrong. "They discussed nothing but the regional trade show issue
all morning," he says.

HILL'S CHOICES ON VETO: A QUICK FIX OR POSSIBLY NO BILL

   Congress can quickly resolve President Clinton's veto of the $264.7
billion fiscal 1996 defense authorization conference by softening the
offending provisions or it could dig in its heels, lessening the likelihood
that there will be a defense authorization for FY '96.
   Clinton vetoed the bill largely because of its provisions for "a costly
missile defense system able to defend 50 states from a long-range missile
threat that our intelligence community does not foresee in the coming
decade." The bill called for developing a national missile defense (NMD)
system for deployment in 2003.
   The president also complained about provisions requiring the discharge
of all service members who test positive for HIV, the virus causing AIDS,
and restricting his authority to put U.S. troops under United Nations
command.
   Senate Armed Services ranking Democrat Sen. Sam Nunn (Ga.) warned of the
veto threat over NMD all year and at one point during the conference,
congressional sources said, chastised Republicans for being more interested
in a campaign issue than in getting a bill.
   Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), chairman of the House National Security
Committee's research and development subcommittee and the leading House
negotiator on missile defense, said the Republicans conceded every NMD
issue to the White House except the call for deployment by a date certain.
Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), chairman of the procurement subcommittee,
said the Republicans wanted to do away with "the research-forever
syndrome."
   "I remain committed to enacting a defense authorization bill for this
fiscal year and will immediately begin work with my colleagues toward this
end," House NSC Chairman Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), said in a statement
issued after the veto last Thursday.
   Spence could not be reached for comment Friday. It was not immediately
clear whether he and Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-
S.C.) would seek to reconvene the conference shortly after the start of the
new session tomorrow or wait until the week beginning Jan. 22 when the
House was scheduled to return for the President's State of the Union
message.
   Starting later raises the possibility that various interests may
separately conclude they are better off with no bill at all. For example,
some proponents of additional B-2 stealth bomber production might prefer no
bill to possible restrictive language against further B-2 production.

PHILIPPINE AIRLINES IN $3 BILLION DEAL FOR 32 AIRBUS, BOEING JETLINERS

   Philippine Airlines is close to finalizing a $3 billion aircraft order
from Airbus Industrie and Boeing, although only Airbus has confirmed the
details of its share.
   An executive with the airline was quoted in Paris press reports early
last week as saying that they were nearly finished working out details of a
buy of eight Boeing 747-400s and 24 Airbus aircraft - a mix of long-range
transports, big twins and medium-haul aircraft.
   Boeing officials were unavailable to confirm their portion of the
order.
   Under the deal, PAL will get four four-engined A340 long-range
widebodies, eight A330 widebody twins - the direct competitor to Boeing's
777 - and a dozen A320s.

RUSSIA, CHINA LAUNCH U.S., INDIAN SATELLITES

   RUSSIA AND CHINA orbited U.S. and Indian satellites Thursday in separate
launches from their respective national launch centers. A Chinese Long
March 2E lifted the U.S. Echostar-1 direct broadcast platform from Xichang,
while a Russian Molniya-M boosted India's IRS-1C from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan with a 550-pound Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization spacecraft dubbed "Skipper" riding piggyback. Skipper was
designed to study reentry vehicle performance for the U.S. missile defense
effort, with instruments developed by Utah State University mounted on a
bus built by Moscow Aviation Institute and NPO Lavotchkin. U.S.-based EOSAT
will distribute the Indian remote sensing data commercially.

CHIEFS' PROCUREMENT PUSH A CONGRESSIONAL PRIORITY FOR FY '97

   Although reworking the fiscal 1996 defense authorization conference
report to satisfy President Clinton's veto will be the first order of
business for the two congressional military committees, both panels start
the year in strong agreement that for FY '97 the focus will be on funneling
more money into procurement without raising the top line in defense
spending.
   Priority for the House National Security and Senate Armed Services
Committees will be rewriting that portion of the FY '96 authorization that
provoked the veto, primarily the ballistic missile defense section. But
once that is out of the way, the FY '97 budget will be next on the agenda.
   The White House is expected to send its defense budget to Capitol Hill
early in February. There is a surprising degree of consensus in Congress,
and in the Pentagon as well, that lawmakers should adhere as closely as
possible to the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that procurement be
boosted 50% to $60 billion in FY '98, two years ahead of the Clinton
Administration's schedule.
   The Joint Chiefs made the recommendation in a budget assessment
submitted in November by their chairman, Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, to
Defense Secretary William J. Perry. Their concern is two-fold: that
existing modernization projects have been delayed by a lack of funds, and
that projected savings elsewhere in the budget may not be realized to free
up monies for increased procurement
   The Administration requested $38.7 billion for procurement in FY '96, a
figure Congress boosted $5.4 billion to $44.1 billion in the defense
appropriations act. Rep. C. W. (Bill) Young (R-Fla.), chairman of the House
Appropriations national security subcommittee, said in an interview that
even while Congress "won't be able to increase the top line," he will try
to increase procurement funds within those numbers.
   The congressional budget resolution set the national security FY '97
ceiling at $267.3 billion in budget authority and $265 billion in outlays,
a rise of $2.6 billion in authority and $1.7 billion in spending. Young
said he plans to call the service chiefs to testify on their request for
speeding up the procurement increase.
   "For them to make this kind of a request and do it publicly is very
unusual," he said, predicting the Chiefs' testimony will swing a lot of
weight on Capitol Hill. "That says to me that they're really serious about
this."
   The Senate panel made its intentions clear in its fiscal 1996 report 
when it said DOD "decisions to cancel or delay modernization programs
create unrealistic modernization funding requirements for the future."
   The Armed Services Committee noted its $5.3 billion procurement boost
and $1.7 billion increase in research and development, and said it believes
that DOD "must continue to fund these accounts at similar, inflation-
adjusted levels in future budget requests."
   House National Security Chairman Rep. Floyd Spence (R-S.C.) said he also
intends to focus on the Joint Chiefs' request to accelerate the
modernization increase. Like Young, Spence said the projected procurement
increase would have to be achieved without raising the top line.
   Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), chairman of the House NSC research and
development subcommittee, said his panel will hold hearings on theater
missile defenses, exploring command and control and the problem of
differentiating between strategic missiles, which are restricted by
treaties, and theater types, which are not.
   Weldon said he is assembling a team of outside experts to tackle the
intelligence community "head on" over their assessments of the Russian
military.
   "My impression right now," he said, "is that the intelligence community
is sanitizing reports to Congress because it wants to support the Russian
leadership."

FOR PENTAGON IN '96, BOSNIA AND THE BUDGET WILL BE KEY

   The Defense Dept. will spend much of 1996 dealing with Bosnia operation
and its $2 billion pricetag. As troops try to keep warring factions apart,
planners back at the Pentagon will be trying to reprogram funds to pay for
the effort.
   Congressional approval for a reprogramming will be required, and
Congress will certainly have a say in the source of the offsets. Defense
Secretary William J. Perry says he wants to take the money from unrequested
funds that Congress provided for fiscal year 1996, including long-lead
money for more B-2 bombers, but he may have trouble doing it.
   Another issue that will pit the Pentagon against Congress is the DOD
plan to reduce the number of theater missile defense programs in its fiscal
1997 budget, which is slated to go to the Hill early this year. The move
comes as Congress is pushing hard for missile defense.
   Congress hasn't been entirely supportive of one TMD program, Corps SAM
(or MEADS) - Senate authorizers proposed zeroing it. But it does enjoy
support at the Pentagon, and, because of its international dimension, isn't
about to be cut.
   This election year isn't likely to see many defense programs on the
chopping block, or even many controversial program decisions, for that
matter. Some of the high stakes decisions were made last year, when the
Pentagon decided to buy only 20 B-2s and to go for more C-17 airlifters
rather than a Non-Developmental Airlift Aircraft.
   Still, some key decisions are slated for 1996. Among the most closely
watched will be the downselect in the Joint Advanced Strike Technology
(JAST) program's concept demonstration phase. But even though one of the
competitors - Boeing, Lockheed Martin and a team headed by McDonnell
Douglas - will be knocked out, many expect the loser to keep an alternative
alive in case JAST hits a snag.
   Munitions programs will also be in the spotlight. The Pentagon will
award two pre-engineering and manufacturing development contracts for the
Joint Air-to-Surface Stand-off Missile (JASSM) program late in the year,
kicking off the effort in earnest. The final downselect in the AIM-9X
Sidewinder competition will also be made a year's end, leaving a candidate
from Hughes, or Raytheon, or a derivative of the British ASRAAM, to be
developed as the new U.S. Air Force/Navy short-range air-to-air missile.
   Pentagon observers will also be watching to see what happens to the
Joint Requirement Oversight Council. Headed by Adm. William Owens, the vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the JROC has had major input in the
merging of service requirements. But industry and DOD officials aren't
certain what Owens' impending retirement will bring, and whether his
replacement, Air Force Gen. John Ralston, will have the same fervor for
program consolidation.
   Also, while the Pentagon in 1996 will probably stick with its strategy
of fighting and winning two nearly simultaneous regional conflicts, a
change to a more modest goal is expected to come in 1997. Such a shift
would almost certainly prompt changes in the force, as well as the
restructuring of programs.

PLUS CA CHANGE: STEADY CONSOLIDATION IN STORE FOR AEROSPACE

   If you're an aerospace CEO with cash burning a hole in your balance
sheet, 1996 may be your best year for a merger or acquisition, but that
doesn't mean the slow, steady consolidation of the 1990s will give way to a
mad rush to close deals this year, financial analysts and industry
executives agree.
   "1996 probably won't be all that different from 1995," says Merrill
Lynch VP Byron Callan, who predicts "one or two surprises" on the scale of
Raytheon's acquisition of E-Systems last spring, "one big multi-industry
divestment," such as Westinghouse's break-up, and "a whole bunch of smaller
deals," along the lines of Litton's buying PRC for $425 million, or Thiokol
buying Howmet.
   What's different this year? "The big thing is just the valuations,"
Callan says, echoing other Wall Streeters who think the $2.3 billion
benchmark Raytheon set for defense electronics acquisitions "is going to
stick."
   Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, defense and aerospace
companies spent most of their energy downsizing, and selling off pieces for
cash - "monetizing," as restructuring leader General Dynamics described it
- but so far very little of that cash has been spent. Coupled with a
modestly improving defense and aerospace outlook, that leaves a lot of
eager buyers and few sellers.
   "ITT is basically frozen out of doing anything" because of the terms of
their existing restructuring plans; "TRW has pretty much said flat out they
don't see the need to do anything rash," and "most of the managements of
big publicly traded companies have said they want to remain independent,
with Northrop Grumman being the prime example of that," Callan says.
   He recently told clients that the scarcity of sellers and the high
prices that will be paid to close deals will have "mixed implications" for
defense and aerospace companies and their shares, "benefiting those stocks
viewed as takeover candidates, while possibly harming those that rely on
growth via acquisition," such as Loral and Tracor.
   While those factors will temper the enthusiasm for mergers and
acquisitions, there are also plenty of reasons to get deals done soon.
Interest rates are low, and 1996 will be the last relatively quiet period
before election-year uncertainty takes hold.
   "From a seller's standpoint, can sellers sit back and wonder if they're
going to get as good a deal in 1997 or 1998," Callan says. "There are a lot
of hypotheticals out there."
   There will be a new Administration; there may be a Republican in the
White House, and there may even be another Bottom-Up Review of defense
plans and programs after the new team takes over. The longer sellers wait,
Callan argues, the more likely it is that buyers' enthusiasm will wane.
   Even so, the lull will be temporary, and some analysts looking just a
little further into the decade think there may be a whole raft of new
defense properties coming on the market. The 1990s saw several big
combinations - Martin Marietta buying GE Aerospace, followed by the new
company's merger with Lockheed; Northrop buying Grumman, and then buying
Vought; Loral buying IBM Federal Systems - and some of those combinations
may begin to unwind in a few years.
   "Bigger has proven better for shareholders, but we wonder just how much
of a competitive advantage it has imparted to those who have embraced
consolidation," Callan says. "If there are two or three more big deals in
1996, we think that an issue for investors to start pondering is whether
the new defense empires might be better able to unlock value by instead
breaking themselves up."

ARPA PUSHING MULTI-CHIP MODULES, MEMS, LOW-POWER DEVICES

   Defense electronics will both push and be pulled by the commercial
market in the coming year, drawing on dual-use technologies capable of
satisfying military requirements for customized, compact, rugged, portable
information subsystems, either embedded in military weapon systems or
capable of providing tailored information services to military personnel.
   Lance Glasser, director of ARPA's Electronics Technology Office, says
cheaper, smaller and faster electronics will create markets beyond today's
applications and enable information technology to be applied to new
domains. Despite the pull of commercial technologies, DOD-unique
technologies, as well as technologies in which DOD needs to lead the state
of the commercial art, will continue to exist.
   The emerging technology of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is
creating families of microscopic sensors and actuators capable of
interfacing directly with microprocessor-based advanced information
processing systems for both military and commercial applications.
Commercial applications are leading the way. Goodyear, for example, is
developing passive sensors that would be embedded in truck tires to monitor
pressure, temperature and tire wear and to provide a unique identification
code for each tire as an anti-theft measure.
   "Coupled with advances in wireless communication, low-power electronics
and conformal/embedded manufacturing, this miniaturization will not only
lead to improvements in the operation and maintenance of
equipment/processes and increased sensing capability over wide areas, but
also to applications in broad areas ranging from personal inertial
navigation systems to microsatellites," says Kaigham J. Gabriel, MEMS
program manager at ARPA.
   Success to date with its Multi-Chip Module (MCM) development program to
integrate digital and analog components in the same package has led ARPA to
push for an end-to-end capability in Application Specific Electronic
Modules (ASEMs) in a variety of military applications.
   Principal goals for ARPA's ASEM program this year call for creating a
full service merchant capability, including design, manufacture and test;
cutting the non-recurring engineering (NRE) time five- to 10-fold from 1992
levels and NRE costs at least five-fold to less than $25,000. Clock speed
is to be pushed up five-fold to 500 MHz.
   ASEMS are the successor to Application Specific Integrated Circuits
(ASICS), and among the trends that ARPA sees driving the new markets for
ASEMs are increased portability of electronic products, greater concern for
the form factor as the products are reduced in size, increased use of
battery-powered wireless products, merging of computing and communications,
greater demands for reliability and anticipated reductions in the cost per
function of around 50% every 18 months.
   In anticipation of expanding demands for low power devices for a wide
spectrum of military applications in mobile, wireless electronic products,
ARPA last year launched a program to create an industry-wide technology
base.
   The goal of the program, designated Low Power Electronics, is to enable
the electronic portions of future systems to dissipate two orders of
magnitude less power than is possible today with conventional technology-
while at the same time maintaining at least parity with current systems in
such performance metrics as clock frequency, bandwidth and noise margins.
   According to Zachary J. Lemnios, low power program manager at ARPA,
applications of the near-term future build on such existing commercial
products as hand-held GPS navigation devices, the constantly shrinking
personal computer, mobile communications devices with global reach and
health monitors and other biomedical devices.

1996 SHAPING UP AS A BIG YEAR IN SPACE, WITH PITFALLS

   Events planned over the next 12 months promise to shape international
spaceflight for decades to come, but just what that shape will be depends
on the outcome of missions and commercial ventures set for launch in 1996,
and on decisions to be made in the White House, on Capitol Hill, and in the
polling places of the Russian Federation.
   By the end of the year the first of the "Big Leo" communications
satellites should be in low-Earth orbit; Europe's Ariane V should be an
operational launch vehicle, and the configurations of the next-generation
U.S. launchers should be a lot clearer.
   However, the future of the International Space Station remains murky.
NASA managers - with the White House watching carefully over their
shoulders - must find a way to keep Russia in the program now that they
have rejected a cost-saving proposal to plug Mir into the configuration
(DAILY, Dec. 26). And the economic reforms at the heart of Russia's space
partnership with the rest of the world will be put to the test in June,
when Russian voters pick a president as Boris Yeltsin's term expires.
   In January, 10 years after the Space Shuttle Challenger was lost, the
Shuttle built to replace it is scheduled to lift off on a mission devoted
in part to testing tools and techniques for Station assembly (DAILY, Dec.
21). As Endeavour orbits overhead, Shuttle managers on the ground will have
started work in earnest to transfer Shuttle operations to United Space
Alliance, a joint venture created to take on the job, by September (DAILY,
Nov. 8, Dec. 1).
   The Shuttle prime contract is but one effort to trim fat from NASA's
budget so it can mount a "balanced" program while building the Station. In
February, NASA's Office of Space Science will launch the first of its
"faster-better-cheaper" Discovery platforms, the $150-million Near Earth
Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR), toward an encounter with 433 Eros in January
1999.
   But in the end it will be the Congress that decides whether the Station
is built. With the U.S. government in budget gridlock as the new year
begins, the $2.1 billion-a-year Station pricetag seems particularly
vulnerable. And the squeeze on NASA spending will become even tighter as
the agency decides which of three competing designs it will build as its X-
33 reusable launch vehicle (RLV) prototype.
   In April the subscale McDonnell Douglas DC-XA will return to the skies
over White Sands, N.M., for a series of vertical takeoff and landing
flights designed to test materials for the X-33 (DAILY, Dec. 16, 1994). By
then the troubled X-34 program should be back on track (Dec. 11, 14),
giving the U.S. two shots at developing the world's first commercial RLV.
   Big spending in government civil space programs like the Station and
Shuttle notwithstanding, the end of the Cold War continues to open
opportunities for commercial space operations. Last year the U.S. launched
more commercial than government expendable launch vehicles, and the trend
will continue in 1996 (DAILY, Dec. 22). Abroad, Ariane V is scheduled to
fly for the first time, and a Russian Proton will launch its first Western
satellite.
   The launch glut is good news for satellite-makers, who have a lot of
hardware to orbit. In September a Delta II is scheduled to launch the first
batch of Iridium communications satellites to LEO, with another flight
scheduled in November, while competitor Globalstar should be putting the
finishing touches on its platforms for a first launch in mid-1997.
   In the U.S. alone, the Aerospace Industries Association expects
commercial programs to pace a $1 billion rise in space-sector sales, to $28
billion for the new year. Profits of a different kind should come in early
in the year, as NASA scientists locked out by the government shutdown
finally get to report the first results from the Galileo spacecraft's probe
of Jupiter's atmosphere. Spectacular images of the Jovian system will
follow in the months to come.

FEELING FLUSH

Largely absent from last year's customer list, U.S. carriers can be
expected to start dusting off long-postponed plans to buy new aircraft and
engines. Jetliner market-watchers waiting for hopeful signs got a good one
Friday - new figures showing that U.S. airlines finally made money in 1995,
after four years of red ink. Air Transport Association chief Carol Hallet
says a sound economy, higher fares, fewer fare wars and cheap gas combined
to produce 1995's $2 billion industry-wide profit, adding that 1996 looks
"hopeful."

BUSY, BUSY

   The balanced-budget battle and accompanying layoff of some federal
workers may make for a relatively busy month of January on Capitol Hill,
contrary to congressional leaders' intentions. House GOP leaders had
planned a three-week vacation after the mandatory start of the second
session of Congress tomorrow, with lawmakers returning the last week in
January for the State of the Union message. Senate Majority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.) had planned no roll call votes in the Senate in January. But
if President Clinton and the Republican congressional leadership produce a
budget settlement, lawmakers would have to be called back to approve
related appropriations bills and implementing provisions.

SLOW START

   Senate consideration of the START II Treaty has been put in limbo by
President Clinton's veto of the fiscal 1996 defense authorization
conference report. Senators took up the treaty on Dec. 22, but GOP leaders
held up a final vote in hopes of putting pressure on Clinton to sign the
defense authorization bill. With the veto, pressure to speed ratification
has eased.

RUSSIAN TALKS

   Russian space officials are pleased at NASA's response to their plea for
help saving money on the International Space Station, even though their
plan to build the new Station around the old Mir was rejected (DAILY, Dec.
26). Engineers at the Russian Space Agency and its top domestic contractors
are studying the NASA counterproposal presented in Houston last month, and
looking forward to another session with U.S. Station officials, probably in
Moscow next week or the week after. Under orders from the Russian
government to cut costs, the engineers had feared a "put-up-or-shut-up"
response from NASA, which would be politically unacceptable to nationalists
and numbers crunchers in the Duma.

NASA'S PLAN

   To help Russia save money and launch vehicles, NASA is willing to ferry
Russian crews to and from the Station once it is inhabited, and to defer
construction and delivery of the Science Power Platform (SPP) and the three
Russian laboratory modules it was to have served. But the complex and
expensive Russian Service Module is still set to be the third Station
element launched under NASA's plan, and that could cause heartburn in
Moscow. So could NASA proposals to assume more flight control
responsibility at Mission Control Center-Houston during assembly, and to
reduce the amount of Russian crew time aboard the Station until the
laboratory modules are delivered.

POWER PROFILE

   Deferring delivery of the SPP, which would use six Russian launches
early in the assembly sequence, will require a substitute for the attitude
control gyrodynes the first SPP segment is to carry. But it won't hamper
power delivery to the U.S. laboratory module originally set for delivery on
the flight following the first SPP delivery. That's because NASA decided
early on that the SPP couldn't give the U.S. lab all the juice it needed,
and shuffled the assembly sequence to place a U.S. solar array on the
Station before the lab goes up (DAILY, July 15, 1994).

JAPANESE SPENDING

   Japan's parliament is expected to sign off on government spending levels
for the fiscal year beginning in April, which includes $47.5 billion for
defense, an increase of 2.58% of the current fiscal year. Under the budget
plan finalized last week, funding for procurement will be $8.19 billion, or
1.2% more than this year.

END IN SIGHT?

   The Joint Primary Attack Trainer System protest saga is slated to come
to a close at the end of this month, when the General Accounting Office
rules on Cessna's protest. Last month the GAO turned down Rockwell's
protest. Raytheon won the hotly contest JPATS program in June (DAILY, June
23), but progress on the program ground to a halt when the protests were
filed.

SECOND SUPER HORNET FLIES

   Two McDonnell Douglas F/A-18E/F Super Hornets are set to enter flight
testing at Patuxent Naval Air Station, Md. early this year. The company and
the Navy last week completed another important milestone on its Super
Hornet program when the second prototype, designated E-2, successfully
completed its first flight. Both E-1 and E-2 will fly in the test program.

TACTICAL UAV GETS GOING

   Following the approval of the Tactical UAV by Pentagon acquisition chief

TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE

   To cash in on the potential savings from DOD's Single Process Initiative
(SPI) this year, contractors will have to act quickly. DOD wants to post
the actual savings by the close of the fourth quarter of FY '96, and that
means contractor-proposed savings in overhead costs must be approved by
already overburdened administrative contracting officers (ACOs) almost
immediately if the changes are to be implemented by mid-year. The SPI seeks
to reduce reliance on military specifications and apply commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) procurement across the defense industry (DAILY, Dec.
8, 11).

AVIONICS OUTLOOK BODES WELL DESPITE DEFENSE CUTS

      Although the production rates for most U.S. military
aircraft programs will continue to be pared down in 1990, the
Commerce Department predicts the U.S. aerospace equipment market
will continue trending upward through the new year.  In the 1990
edition of the agency's U.S. Industrial Outlook, Commerce
Department experts predict the value of aerospace product
shipments will climb from $105.7 billion in 1989 to $114.2
billion in 1990.  That represents a gain of 3.8 percent after
adjusting for inflation.
      The report, which looks at very large segments of the
aerospace industry, gives avionics providers an idea of which
segments to target by pointing out where the greatest share of
growth will take place.  According to the report:
     Large jet aircraft production "will drive industry growth in
1990." Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are expected to deliver 512
transport aircraft in the new year.  That is the largest number
shipped since 1968.
     Demand for general aviation airplanes and helicopters is
expected to increase in 1990.  Shipments of U.S. general aviation
airplanes should pass the $2 billion mark for the first time
since 1981.
     U.S. manufacturers will pare down production rates on most
military aircraft programs in 1990.  The U.S. government will
take fewer deliveries from all fighter programs.  On a more
positive note, McDonnell Douglas is slated to deliver its first
C-17 transport aircraft in late 1990.  Also, the government is
expected to make the contract award in 1990 for 211 off-the-shelf
business jet aircraft for the Tanker-Transport Trainer System
(TTTS).  If the contract is indeed awarded, it will be the
largest single business jet buy in history.
     U.S. shipments of missiles, space vehicles, and related
products are forecast to grow more than 3 percent in 1990.
Increasing production of U.S. expendable launch vehicles will
pace the expansion.
     U.S. aerospace trade will rise to a record high in 1990.
Projected exports of $33.1 billion and imports of $11.3 billion
will yield a trade surplus of $21.8 billion, up 12 percent from
the estimated 1989 surplus.

Cautious Optimism Tone For Long-Term Outlook

      As is the case the immediate future, the report also
indicates that civil aerospace programs will be the focus through
the new decade.  Civil aircraft production will account for 54
percent of total aircraft shipments through the year 2000.  The
Boeing Co., the Commerce Department noted, forecasts world demand
for 8,417 large transport aircraft valued at $516 million by the
year 2005.

AIA SEES RECORD AVIONICS SALES FOR 1990

      Sales of aerospace products, including avionics, will reach
record levels in 1990, fueled by sales of new civil aircraft and
modernization of older military airframes, according to the year-
end forecast of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA).
      Total sales for 1990 are expected to reach $137.4 billion,
representing a 14 percent gain for the industry, AIA said.
Profits for 1989, however, declined from $4.9 billion to a
preliminary estimate of $4.3 billion.
      The civil aircraft sector will be supported by a record
backlog and increased demand for transport aircraft by the
world's airlines.  That sector's sales will surge from $20.1
billion in 1989 to a projected $32 billion this year.  Sales
activity in the military aircraft sector will also rise slightly
in 1990, but will decline in real terms from 1989's figure of $42
billion as a result of continued cutbacks in defense spending,
AIA said.
      Despite the projected growth in sales, AIA pointed out that
spending for military aircraft, a category of aerospace business
which has recorded strong growth throughout the 1980s, is
projected to have declined in 1989 by 4 percent after adjustment
for inflation.  Total sales to the U.S. government, primarily the
Pentagon, are expected to have risen 4.3 percent in 1989 to $72.2
billion.  Washington is the largest single customer for aerospace
products.

But EIS Predicts Flat Defense Electronics Sales

      Meanwhile, another industry group is predicting flat or
declining sales for defense electronics components.  Sales of
defense electronics products will "remain at or slightly below"
levels reached in 1989, the Electronic Industries Association
(EIA) said.  The trade group estimated defense electronics sales
for 1989 totaled $55 billion.

SIMULATION/ELECTRONICS SEEN WEATHERING BUDGET STORM

      While future defense budgets are expected to fall, some
financial analysts and industry officials are predicting that the
simulation and electronics industries will be relatively
untouched by cuts in Pentagon spending and may even grow.
      According to Dr. Malcolm Currie, chairman and CEO of Hughes
Aircraft Co., new military tools that are being shaped by
emerging technologies will require new levels of training, new
skills and new education to be used effectively.  These new high-
technology tools offer "tremendous opportunity for a growth
industry" in simulation and training, says Currie.
      "Today we face reduced defense budgets, diminished
resources, and reduced force levels.  We have the continuing pace
of technology and the complexity of equipment to deal with,"
according to Currie.
      Wolfgang Demische, a well-respected analyst with UBS
Securities Inc., said if current budgetary trends continue for
several years "the simulation and training [business] might look
somewhat better" than weapons development.  GM Hughes, Raytheon
and Loral are positioned well for these opportunities, Demische
said in an interview with AVIONICS REPORT.
      An "emphasis on upgrading existing platforms" with force-
enhancing electronics will become attractive to a fiscally
conservative Pentagon and Congress, and as a result, advanced
electronic and composite material industries are good places to
invest, Byron Callon, an aerospace/defense analyst for Prudential
Bache, told AVIONICS REPORT.
      Charles Gabriel, senior vice president of the Washington
Research Group, affiliated with Credit Lyonnaise, believes the
industry will become "leaner, meaner, more qualitative."
      Some analysts, Paine Webber for example, feel defense
electronics stocks should generally be avoided.
      Surveillance, arms control verification, and avionics
upgrades will not be significant growth areas in the future,
according to Paine Webber analysts.
      The brokerage firm is telling customers who are still hungry
for defense electronics stocks to consider buying in June 1990
since Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will be in the United
States and talk of arms control treaties could increase the value
of defense electronics stocks.

DAB FOR MIDS EXPECTED IN FEBRUARY;OSD TO RECOMMEND MIDSCO

      Officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)
will recommend that the international consortium, MIDSCO Inc., be
awarded a sole-source, firm-fixed-priced, full-scale development
(FSD) contract for NATO's Multifunctional Information
Distribution System (MIDS), Pentagon sources tell AVIONICS
REPORT.
      The recommendation will be made next month at a meeting of
the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB).  The program is expected to
be worth as much as $5 billion to participating companies over
the next 20 years.
      OSD will recommend that MIDSCO get the contract in order to
allay European concerns, sources said.  European firms make up
the bulk of the MIDSCO consortium, which is headquartered in
Delaware.
      A Navy official close to the MIDS program said that the
international concerns are very important because all the
nations' monies are needed to keep the program alive.
       The MIDSCO group is composed of Plessey Electronics Systems
Corp. (U.S.), Thomson-CSF (France), Siemens (Germany), Italtel
(Italy) and Inisel (Spain).  The Navy official said the U.S. is
contributing about 40 percent of the funds for the program and
the Europeans are putting up the balance.
      But others said since there are no "purely owned" U.S.
companies in the MIDSCO group, it will be difficult for the
consortium to get the contract.  Plessey U.S. is part of the
British-based firm which was recently bought out by GEC of
Britain and Germany's Siemens (AR, Sept. 22, 1989, p. 1).

Hughes Wants Role

      Officials at Hughes Aircraft Co. are irritated by reports
that MIDSCO will get the MIDS development contract.  The firm
fired off a letter last August saying it had not been given a
fair chance to participate in the FSD phase of the MIDS program
and requested that the Defense Department reconsider OSD's
position on the FSD contract award.  Hughes officials tell
AVIONICS REPORT that if MIDSCO is awarded the contract, the U.S.
will be sending its money overseas.  A Hughes official also said
that his firm's substantial effort on the Joint Tactical
Information Distribution System (JTIDS), which MIDS will be based
on, qualifies it for consideration for the FSD award.
      A Pentagon source said that in a reply letter to Hughes, OSD
said "We will take your (Hughes') concerns through the
acquisition process and keep you advised along the way."  He
added that while MIDSCO will be recommended for the FSD contract,
there is no guarantee that the DAB will agree and said that the
process is "rigorous and very democratic."
      A Pentagon official made it clear that the full-scale
production phase of the MIDS program will be competitive.

Joint Venture Possible

      Indeed, he mentioned it is possible that some sort of joint
venture for MIDS may be decided on at the DAB.  An Air Force
source confirmed that a lot of talk about a joint venture had
occurred.  Others noted a joint venture would force the Pentagon
to change some of the original ground rules in the MIDS program
which basically called for MIDS to go sole-source to MIDSCO.
      However, an Air Force source pointed out that the idea of a
joint venture has not "really been thought about in the
international environment" and added that "everything has been
negotiated to date within the current MIDSCO structure."
      The Air Force source also disclosed that since it is an
international program, MIDS was originally going to bypass the
conventional U.S. acquisition process.  But John Betti, under
secretary of defense/acquisition, said last August that his
office should have some input into the MIDS program.  The
February DAB meeting is an outgrowth of Betti's request, an Air
Force source said.

MOU/RFP Being Readied

      Describing the current status of the program, a Pentagon
source told us that Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) for FSD
between the participating nations are being finalized and that a
Request for Proposal (RFP) is nearing completion by several
working groups in the MIDS program.  He said a letter of intent
is ready for the various nations to review that, if approved,
would allow the release of the RFP after the DAB meeting next
month.
      If the DAB decides to proceed with a joint venture for MIDS
FSD, meaning Hughes participation in addition to MIDSCO for
example, then the program could be delayed by one and a half to
two years because the acquisition process would have to be
redone, sources said.  RFPs would have to be rewritten and sent
out to industry for comment and bids would have to be obtained
again and  government/industry negotiations would have to start
all over, sources said.
      According to Pentagon sources, the Navy will have the lead
for the U.S. in the program and the Air Force will play a
supporting role.  The Navy F/A-18 jet-fighter will be the U.S.
platform that first uses the MIDS terminal.  A Navy source close
to the program confirmed that this is what OSD has been saying
verbally, but added that OSD's "grammar has been nebulous" and
not totally reassuring.
      Industry sources said the Air Force wanted the lead on MIDS
and had called for the FSD to be competitive.  A Pentagon
official acknowledged that the Air Force did want the lead on the
program but that for budgetary reasons and because it did not
elect the F-16 as a MIDS platform, the Navy was given the lead.
      An Air Force source said he was unaware that a final
decision had been made to give the Navy the lead.

SAR REPORT UNDERSTATES NAVSTAR GPS PROCUREMENT COSTS

      A General Accounting Office (GAO) report states that a
Selective Acquisition Report (SAR) for the Navstar Global
Positioning System (GPS) understates Navy and Marine Corps
requirements by 4,000 units and subsequent procurement costs by
$200 to $400 million.
      Initial SAR estimates in December 1988 said the Air Force
total program cost for user equipment would be $4.1 billion
(escalated dollars) for about 25,500 sets.
      The GAO report also states that delays in operational
testing of low-rate production sets will result in a 15-month
postponement of a full-rate production decision, from March 1989
to June 1990. Operational testing of low-rate production sets
should have been completed in the third and fourth quarters of FY
'90.
      The Navstar GPS is a "space-based radio navigation system
designed to provide precise, continuous, all-weather, common
geographical coordinate system, world positioning navigation
data, together with time and velocity information, for a
multiplicity of military and civil users," according to the
report. The Air Force, Army and Navy joint program has been in
low-rate initial production since June 1986.
      Only 5 percent of all military platforms able to carry the
system will be tested. The report says, "Air Force officials
stated that while the number of test platforms is limited,
additional data from other operational tests for other
modifications involving GPS user equipment will be used and the
combined testing data will cover 90 percent of the interfaces
between GPS user equipment and other navigational and weapon
systems." The platforms to be used are: F-16 fighter; the SH-60
antisubmarine warfare helicopter; LST-1179 tank landing ship;
FFG-7 fast frigate; CG-26 guided missile cruiser; SSN-637 nuclear
powered submarine; SWCL light special warfare craft; the UH-60
Manpack troop transport helicopter; and the HMMWV (High Mobility
Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle).
      A fully operational GPS consists of a space segment with 21
satellites and three orbiting spares, "in six orbital planes
about 10,900 nautical miles above the earth." A ground control
segment with a master control station, three ground antenna and
five monitoring stations around the world to control the
spacecraft are also included. In addition it will contain a user
equipment segment with four types of radio receivers to convert
satellite signals into navigation, time and position information.
      The four types of receivers are: five channel sets for high
performance aircraft; five channel sets for ships and submarines;
two channel sets for medium performance aircraft, like
helicopters; and the Manpack/Vehicular set for hand-held and
vehicle applications. The space segment is in full-rate
production and the control system has been installed and prepared
for Space Command turnover. The GAO report outlined the delay-
plagued program as follows:

UPCOMING GPS EVENT SCHEDULE CHANGES

EVENT                              Dec. 1986   Dec. 1988  Months
                                   Estimate    Estimate   Delayed

Production Satellite Launched      Oct. 1988   Feb. 1989     4
Operational Field Testing Finished June 1989   Aug. 1989     2
Final Operational Test Report                  Apr. 1990    NA
Full-rate Production Decision      Mar. 1989   June 1990    15
GPS Fully Operational              Mar. 1991   Mar. 1993    24

      The report attributes the delays to numerous circumstances
including late deliveries of equipment by contractors, and
contractors experiencing start-up and producibility problems.
"Under the current test plan," the report states, "operational
testing will cover about a five-month period, from July through
November 1989. Analysis and interim report preparation will take
up to 90 days, and final reporting for a full-rate production
decision will take another 60 days. Program officials expect the
final test report to be submitted on April 15, 1990."
      The DoD requires a complete report 45 days prior to a
Defense Acquisition Board meeting. Program officials are
confident that further testing and reporting will be completed by
the June 1990 deadline, according to the report.

RAYTHEON NETS NAVY OTH RADAR AWARD

      Raytheon will construct three Relocatable Over-the-Horizon
Radar (ROTHR) systems for deployment in Virginia, Guam and a
third strategic location under a $273.7 million contract awarded
by the Navy on Dec. 28, 1989.  The first production system will
be deployed in Virginia and will cover the Caribbean.  The Navy
is said to be studying procurement of up to a dozen ROTHRs in
order to minimize the use of ships and aircraft for surveillance.
Raytheon's contract with the Navy includes an option for a fourth
production system.  Each ROTHR can detect aircraft and surface
ships at a range of up to 1,800 miles in an arc in excess of 60
degrees.  Work on the contract is expected to be completed by
1993.

LORAL FINALIZES PURCHASE OF HONEYWELL E-O DIVISION

      Just as this issue went to press, Loral Corp. said it had
completed its purchase of the Electro-Optics Division (EOD) of
Honeywell Inc. for $54 million in cash (AR, Dec. 1, 1989, p. 5).
The new division will be known as Loral Infrared and Imaging
Systems Inc.
      Loral, the nation's 35th largest defense contractor with DoD
contracts for $494 million in FY '88, said the division--a major
producer of electro-optic subsystems and components for airborne
reconnaissance, threat warning detection, passive situation
awareness, missile guidance and targeting--will have 1989 sales
of $130 million and a backlog of $160 million.
      Some of E-O's major projects include the ATARS IR
linescanner and the AAR-47 missile warning system.  Loral said
the acquisition will boost its position in all-weather, high-
resolution, day-night imaging for reconnaissance and missile
guidance across a spectrum of sensor technologies.  Loral
Electro-Optical Systems garnered $76 million in DoD contracts
during fiscal 1988.

Loral Wins $7.7 Million Long-Lead Funding for AN/ALR-56M

      Meanwhile, the Air Force last month awarded $7.7 million in
long-lead funding to Loral for the first production option on the
AN/ALR-56M advanced radar warning receiver (ARWR) for the F-16
and F-4.  The Air Force decision follows Loral's guilty plea to
three counts of violating federal procurement law in the Ill Wind
case relating to the ALR-56M competition (AR, Dec. 15, 1989, p.
5).  Through an agreement, Loral was allowed to remain the prime
contractor on the ALR-56M.
      In a related development, Litton Corp. confirmed that it
will compete against Loral for the $70 million ARWR option that
Loral was forced to drop as part of its settlement with the
government.  The option will come up in 1992.

THOMSON SECURING EUROPEAN ATC WORK

      Recent contracts from the governments of France and
Yugoslavia show Thomson-CSF continuing to expand its role in
European Air Traffic Control.
      The larger contracts, in France, consist of a 65 million FF
agreement to update part of the radioelectric air network for air
navigation and a 15 million FF contract with the French Air
Navigation Technical Department to supply a second experimental
mode S and monopause secondary radar station.
      Yugoslavia meanwhile, has contracted with Thomson CSF to
upgrade and extend that country's ATC.  The value of the contract
was not provided.  It provides for Thomson-CSF to fit two long-
range primary radars it installed at Belgrade and Zagreb in the
early 1970s with more sophisticated receivers and signal
processing units.  These units will be associated with two new
RSM 970 monopause secondary radars.  In addition, a third
independent RSM 970 radar will be installed in the southern
region of Yugoslavia.

JANUARY CONTESTS TO KICK OFF RETURN TO GROWTH
Within Days: ILFC, Malaysian, South African, Philippines

Even though 1996 is shaping up as the first genuine growth year for
commercial aircraft enginemakers this decade, many of the biggest campaigns
will be decided much sooner - by month's end, the market share landscape
for General Electric, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce may be dramatically
altered.
   Top marketing executives from all three enginemakers tell AP that as
they look ahead this year, it's clear that 1995's optimism wasn't
misplaced. A few carriers are poised to make major decisions on big
turbofans for large aircraft this month, and many other key competitions
involving GE's GE90 and CF6, P&W's PW4000 Series and Rolls-Royce's Trent
and RB211-535 will probably be decided early in the year.
   In some cases, numbers are still being worked out. But right now engine
marketeers are fighting hard to power aircraft for Air India, International
Lease Finance Corp., Delta, Air China, China Airlines, South African
Airways, Malaysian Air System and Philippine Air Lines. In addition, while
not officially in the market for new aircraft, insiders say American
Airlines, Northwest Airlines, TWA and Continental are all hot prospects for
1996.

any day now
   Marketing executives describe many of the deals as being at the "any-
day-now" stage, among them Air India, which may buy 10 firm plus 13 option
Boeing 777s or McDonnell Douglas MD-11 trijets, and South African Airways,
looking at ways to power six firm and 10 option 777s. Malaysian Air System,
expected this week to announce plans to buy as many as 25 long-range Boeing
jetliners, 777s and 747-400s, is also close to choosing engines and may
unveil its engine decision along with its aircraft decision.
   International Lease Finance Corp., which is reportedly looking at around
a "dozen" Airbus A330 widebody twins, along with perhaps 18 to 20 777s, is
seen by many as making up its mind before the end of January. Airbus, on
the losing end of 1995's market share battle after a triumphant 1994, was
pushing hard for a decision before the end of December, but ILFC chief
Steven Hazy has reportedly signaled that mid- to late-January is a more
likely date.
   "The other one right behind it is Delta," which wants to start phasing
out its elderly Lockheed L-1011 trijets, says one of Rolls-Royce's
marketing chiefs. The first few retirements will probably be replaced by
exercising existing options on Boeing 757s. But sometime this quarter the
carrier is expected to declare the competition open, at which time "they
will be looking at a longer-term replacement for the Tri-Star," he says.
That evaluation could take some time, running into 1996's fourth quarter.
   A few 1996 contests are active without actually being declared, among
them American Airlines and Delta.
   "Don't expect a selection" at American in 1996, "but a lot of
posturing," says a GE executive. "American has stated their desire for
777s, and that will probably be considered by the aircraft and enginemakers
as a campaign."
   Still, tight-fisted American Chairman Bob Crandall has also made it
clear that he won't buy an airplane - ever - unless he can make it cost
less than anything he's already operating, which at least one marketeer
thinks may be too tall an order. "Crandall's party line is no new
airplanes," a Rolls executive adds, although "we continue to update them
every couple of months on the progress of the Trent, and we visit them
regularly in hopes that we are positioning the Trent" as a credible
candidate whenever an evaluation finally gets underway.
   Northwest, already on the list to start receiving Airbus A330 twins, is
reportedly quietly in the market for 777 twins this year, and Boeing thinks
there's a niche for a few 777s at that airline. All three enginemakers are
expected to make the trek to Eagan, Minn., within three to four weeks to
show off GE90s, PW4084s and Trent 800s.
   Egyptair has been in the best-and-final offer stage for engines to power
its three Boeing 777s for months, and at least two of the enginemakers say
they've "won" the competition three times. With spares, and the relatively
high margins produced by small, non-launch customers, Egyptair could be
worth about $800 million to the winning enginemaker within the next few
weeks.
   Like Delta, TWA hopes to start replacing L-1011 Tri-Stars, but engine
industry executives expect the carrier to use the decision this year as an
opportunity to get smaller, cashing in the airplanes in favor of a mix of
Boeing 767 widebodies and 757 narrowbodies. America West and Continental
are also in the market for additional Boeing 757s, a market where Pratt &
Whitney's PW2000 competes with Rolls' RB211-535.

'controlled growth'
   "When you look at what the environment is, traffic and revenues are
fairly strong, and...airlines are starting to see some of the results" of
previous years' cost-cutting, says a Rolls executive. As a result, airlines
now feel better about returning to a buying mode, but executives agree that
you won't see a return to the buying frenzy of the mid-1980s.
   "If there's one word that summarizes it, it's controlled growth," he
says. "There's still some caution at the airlines about adding new
aircraft, and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that there's a
heavy debt load out there. Let's face it, towards the end of the '90s there
could be another cycle downturn, plus you've got a lot of pilot issues out
there."
   In addition, some of the euphoria will begin to wear off as marketing
efforts shift from the Far East - where new aircraft, especially widebody
twins, have been selling like crazy to newly cash-rich airlines - to Europe
and North America, where carriers are healthy again, but chastened.
   That may mean a cooling off period from 1995's new order growth rate,
which outpaced 1994's nearly four times over. But cool doesn't mean cold,
and the enginemakers remain optimistic about prospects in North America and
Europe.
   "On big twins, very few people in Europe and North America made a move"
in recent years, remarks one P&W executive. "The wave of big twins sweeping
through Asia is already decided...and the next wave has probably got to go
through Europe and North America.
   "The big twin market race is not over," he declares, and the 777 "is not
just an Asian airplane. Boeing has hit a home-run with this airplane."

BOEING RATE HIKES SIGNAL JETLINER RECOVERY
Faster Ramp-Up For 777; Previous Cut-Back Plans Reversed

   Enginemakers looking for hard evidence of recovery need look no further
than Seattle: Boeing is boosting jetliner production rates for the first
time in three years, and should reach 24 aircraft per month by early 1997
as 777 production rises faster than originally planned.
   Apart from the 757 long-range narrowbody, Boeing reports rates will rise
across the board - 737 and 777 come in for the biggest hike - and
management is putting off a planned 757 decrease for three months. By the
fourth quarter of 1996 Boeing should be building 22.5 aircraft per month,
rising to 24 when the 777, which entered service last spring, reaches full
speed.
   The rate hike is partly to catch up after a two-month Machinists'
strike. But it also reflects a fundamental recovery in the jetliner
marketplace, and it led the company to sound its most optimistic tone about
production since the 1990s began.
   "This is a positive sign to see the beginning of an upswing in
production rates," says Boeing Commercial Airplane Group President Ron
Woodard. "It reflects the turnaround that our customers are experiencing
and underscores the positive long-term outlook for our industry."
   Rates on the 737, originally expected to slip from today's seven per
month to five next April, will instead rise to 8.5 per month by the fourth
quarter of 1996. Production of 747s will rise from two per month to 3.5 in
the fourth quarter, while 757 production will hold at four aircraft per
month until September, 1996, when the rate goes to three. At the same time,
767 production will rise by half an airplane, to four per month.
   Boeing is also ramping up 777 widebody twin rates faster than originally
projected. The company was going to build three 777s each month throughout
1996 and then boost the rate to four per month in 1997. But yesterday
Boeing said it would build 3.5 777s each month by the third quarter of
1996, and will build five per month in early 1997.
   Even with two quarters of recovery under its belt this year, Boeing
originally planned to cut production back. Through the first half of 1995
the company booked 25% more orders than it had through all of 1994, but the
new orders wouldn't have started paying off until 1997 or later, and Boeing
was supposed to remain stuck at 17.5 planes per month until at least 1997.
   Management now thinks rates should recover to 20 aircraft per month
during the first quarter of 1996. Boeing describes this as "pre-strike
levels," suggesting that non-strike rates never actually hit the 17.5-plane
nadir originally forecast, although during the strike the company barely
managed to push out a dozen planes a month.
   "Boeing...continues to work with customers on the specific delivery
timing following the strike," the company says in a prepared statement
detailing the new production rates, and expects to project total 1996
deliveries before the end of January.
   Peak deliveries came in 1992, when Boeing built 441 aircraft at a rate
of better than 36 planes a month.

GE90 MAY NEED MORE TESTS TO WIN EARLY ETOPS
Teething Problems, FAA Discomfort Combine To Move The Goalposts

   Officials on the FAA's Reliability Assessment Board - the body that
gives thumbs-up or down to enginemakers' requests for ETOPS clearance -
will probably give General Electric the go-ahead this month to begin its
crucial 1,000-cycle flight test series on the GE90, but early extended twin
operations clearance probably won't be granted without additional ground
test runs, sources tell AP.
   It's widely believed that board members and U.S. airworthiness
authorities remain uncomfortable with the concept of early long-range twin
clearance, particularly in the face of pressure from even more skeptical
European counterparts. One source says that at least four out of seven
board members, when asked to produce a draft of their decision on GE90 in
October, came down against early ETOPS.
   And a surge during an acceptance flight last month for a GE90-powered
British Airways 777 - embarrassingly, less than a week before GE was due to
appear before the board to prove the GE90 was reliable enough to go on to
the next phase of testing - didn't help. That surge held up deliveries of
BA's second and third airplanes, although FAA late last month okayed a
proposal to modify fan tip clearances just on BA's GE90s as an interim
solution to expedite deliveries.

clearance modification
   A GE spokesman tells AP this week that British Airways now has its
second aircraft, and the third should be delivered before the middle of
this month. Aircraft already in service will get the clearance modification
sometime in mid-January "as a precaution," he says.
   But are all these troubles enough to scupper early ETOPS? Probably not,
airworthiness authorities in the U.S. and Europe privately concede. At the
same time, however, regulators point out that the GE90 design has been
tweaked several times over the past half year, and another set of ground
runs is "probably not a bad idea," says one U.S. official.
   If the word from the board is to go for more tests, the answer needs to
come soon - the 1,000 cycle ETOPS test will take about four months to run,
a period of time during which additional ground runs could be done without
jeopardizing delivery dates or promises on winning the extended- range
clearance. After that, some delay would be inevitable, and that could cost
GE millions of dollars.

THIOKOL, CARLYLE CLOSE ON HOWMET FOR $750 MILLION
Rocket-maker Could Own Howmet Outright By 1999

   Rocket-maker Thiokol and aerospace-heavy merchant bank The Carlyle Group
closed last month on their joint purchase of gas turbine components and
repair giant Howmet Corp. for $750 million.
   "The new owners support Howmet's management philosophy and the direction
we are taking the company," says Howmet President and CEO David Squire.
"With their encouragement, we will continue to sharpen our focus on serving
customers, while pursuing the many growth opportunities that lie before
us."
   As in many other deals completed with Carlyle's help, Carlyle will hold
the majority stake but stands ready to sell it to Thiokol after three
years. The deal's structure means that despite the $750 million purchase
price and 49% initial Thiokol stake in the new Howmet, the cash effect to
Thiokol is only $100 million. Thiokol and Carlyle will each put up $100
million, financing the $550 million balance with non-recourse debt and the
issuance of preferred stock.
   With headquarters in Greenwich, Conn. and 30 plants around the world,
Howmet specializes in making and refurbishing precision investment castings
for gas turbines used on aircraft and in industrial applications, as well
as component repairs for ground-based gas turbines.

UTC CHIEF DAVID HINTS AT ENGINE, HELO ACQUISITIONS
Lack Of Candidates Has Been Obstacle

   Despite hot rumors, United Technologies Corp. isn't interested in
selling its aerospace units, says UTC chief George David, but the company
would look long and hard at acquisitions, particularly anything that could
give UTC an edge over General Electric in the engine business.
   Two of UTC's aerospace units - Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney - have been
the subject of merger and sell-off rumors, and early last year, David
wouldn't rule out putting Sikorsky up for sale. In August, the London
financial markets started their annual rumor of a merger between P&W and
rival Rolls-Royce.
   But selling is now out of the picture, and David says "it might even be
nice if we could make an acquisition, or two, or three," with the caveat
that any acquisition be a ready fit for UTC with no pruning.
   After a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, David tells AP
that he would consider acquisitions in either the engine or helicopter
market, and that so far the only obstacle has been a lack of candidates.
   He hints that one reason UTC is interested in buying on the propulsion
side is to boost Pratt & Whitney in its "neck-and-neck" competition with
General Electric.

INT'L JET ENGINE SUPPLY TO ACQUIRE STARTUP CARRIER
Merger With Air 21 Up For Shareholder Approval

   International Jet Engine Supply agreed to merge with startup carrier Air
21, effectively acquiring the Fresno, Calif.-based regional airline if the
carrier's shareholders okay the deal in a special meeting slated for
Friday.
   Under the agreement worked out last week, each share of Air 21 common
stock will be converted into one share of International Jet common stock,
and Air 21 will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of IJES.
   Air 21 just started a low-fare jet service to Fresno, Palm Springs, and
San Francisco, Calif., and Las Vegas.

ANOTHER ROLLS-ROYCE BULK ORDER FROM GULFSTREAM
Tay 611 Builds To Run Into Next Decade

   Gulfstream Aerospace handed G-IV business jet engine sole-source
Rolls-Royce another bulk engine order last month, taking production of the
Tay 611 small turbofan into the next century with a commitment worth more
than a quarter of a billion dollars.
   The new contract also answers industry speculation that with the
introduction of the new G-V business jet - powered by BMW Rolls-Royce's
BR710 turbofan - the G-IV and G-IV SP might begin to wind down.
   "Today's announcement reconfirms Gulfstream's plan to build the G-IV SP
and G-V concurrently," Rolls says in a prepared statement. The 13,850 lbst.
Tay 611 already powers 280 G-IV and G-IV SP business jets.

RUSSIAN COURT TAKES UP RYBINSK CHALLENGES NEXT WEEK
Future For GE's 'Strategic Partner' Should Resolve

   The two-year battle over whether and how to privatize Russia's once-
proud Rybinsk Motors - General Electric's strategic partner in the former
Soviet Union - looks set to end next week, when a Russian high court will
take up a lawsuit challenging the state's authority to put up stakes in the
company for public sale.
   The State Property Committee's Federal Bankruptcy Agency had hoped to
put 37% of the aircraft enginemaker on the block last week, but wound up
putting off the auction until mid-February because of another lawsuit
claiming that part of that stake had already been set aside for workers.
   But the second lawsuit, by AO Rybinskiye Motory itself against the
state, claims that the whole privatization is improper, a suit that will be
heard Jan. 15 by a Moscow high court.
   "I venture to suppose that the court will not decide this case in favor
of Rybinsk Motors," says Georgy Tal, the bankruptcy agency's first deputy
chief executive. "And after that the decision of the lower court will be
meaningless."
   That would clear the way for the auction to proceed, and for Rybinsk to
settle down to the business of recovery.
   Rybinsk makes engines for almost all Russia's military transports and
more than half of its civil aircraft, including the Ilyushin Il-76,
Ilyushin Il-62 and Tupolev Tu-154M, but output tumbled to six engines per
month in 1995 after averaging nearly 10 a month in 1994.
   Last fall GE worked out framework agreements with Rybinsk covering any
GE engine with potential Russian applications, and the goal - now delayed -
was to have solid agreements worked out by the end of 1995 covering at
least three engines in five applications: the CT7 turboprop on the Sukhoi
Su-80 and Kamov Ka-64, CFM International medium turbofans for re-engining
projects, and industrial turbine installations.

GENERAL ELECTRIC

   GENERAL ELECTRIC may wind up being rival Pratt & Whitney's biggest
cheerleader, at least for now. That's because as the first early ETOPS
engine in commercial service, the PW4084 is under the microscope as the
validation - or repudiation - of the whole idea of winning extended twin
operations clearance from entry into service. GE may not like P&W, but
until the GE90 gets its own early ETOPS approval, GE needs to ensure that
the concept gets all the support it needs.
   "They better pray nothing happens to [the P&W] engine," quips an FAA
official, noting that GE may not hear definitively about early ETOPS until
mid-1996.

IS IT GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS?

   IS IT GOOD NEWS OR BAD NEWS? Airbus Industrie delivered 106 aircraft
through November, a lot more than it booked in new orders. Some financial
analysts like to see that - it means inventory is being converted into cash
as the backlog slims down. But it also means that future deliveries, and
thus future cash flow, will be curtailed, and that could pose interesting
problems for aircraft enginemakers looking to new Airbus products for
market expansion.
   One industry veteran tells AP that the money problem couldn't come at a
worse time for the European consortium. "They have to solve" the problem of
the A330 and A340, he says, noting that if Boeing keeps its market lead
with the 777, a re-engining isn't enough to keep up with the 777's range
and payload. "The A330/A340 wing is maxed-out," he says. Regardless of
engine, "you won't go any faster, any farther."

IRAN MAY BE CLOSE

   IRAN MAY BE CLOSE to a deal to open an aircraft plant to build Russian
jetliners, some 17 years after the Islamic revolution closed the door to
flag carrier Iran Air renewing its fleet of Boeing-built jetliners.
Published reports in Iran claim that the Isphahan plant in central Iran
will start building Tu-114 transports within a year, and other planes are
reportedly also under study.
   Some of the Boeing planes won't wait for new production: Iran is also
reportedly near a deal to buy 12 Tupolev Tu-154 jetliners outright.

JAPAN'S NEW FIGHTER ENGINE

   JAPAN'S NEW FIGHTER ENGINE project will survive, despite postponement of
the fighter prototype the engine was supposed to power. Japan's government
agreed last week on a new five-year defense plan that scuttled the future
fighter program - slated to produce a demonstrator aircraft by the turn of
the century (AP, Sept. 29, 1994) - in favor of continuing work on the
program's 10,000 lbst.-class turbofan. Japan's Defense Agency hopes to use
Ishikawajima-Harima's 3,674 lbst. F3-30 turbofan, which now powers the
Kawasaki T-4 trainer, as the starting point for the new machine.
   JDA also cut back on its FS-X procurement, dropping 11 of the 141
originally planned U.S./Japan co-developed fighters under pressure from the
Finance Ministry.

BLIZZARD OF '96 WREAKS HAVOC; WILL COST INDUSTRY MILLIONS

      The blizzard on the East Coast brought most air freight
operations to a standstill for parts of last week. Airport closures
from North Carolina to Maine had a ripple effect on air travel
throughout the country, forcing countless cancellations and delays. 
      United Parcel Service, which operates regional sort hubs in
Newark and Philadelphia, trucked all air packages to open airports
and diverted flights to its Louisville, Ky. headquarters, says UPS
spokesperson Ken Sternad. "We had a lot of contingency plans to
keep things moving and made alternative arrangements where customers
could pick up packages at our facilities or had drivers walking in
some areas." 
      The storm is going to cost UPS millions of dollars, mostly in
added operational costs such as overtime, rerouting of flights and
using a less efficient distribution system, he says.  
      "[Jan. 8] will go down as a day of infamy," says FedEx
spokesperson Bill Carroll. "Our whole East Coast operation pretty
much came to a stop because all major airports were closed. We have
dealt with a lot of ice, hurricanes and earthquakes, but we have
never been hit this hard in such a large area. Usually disasters
are confined to a fairly small geographic area and don't have such
a far reaching impact," he says.
      Airborne Express couriers made deliveries on foot in New York
City early last week, but did not face the pickup and delivery
obstacles of FedEx and UPS because the company focuses on primarily
business accounts, says Airborne spokesperson Scott Hopper. "The
downtown business areas were cleared first so we were able to reach
customers," he says. "We had planes on the ground on the West Coast
and other warmer cities, but by Wednesday we were making about 60%
of our deliveries." 
      DHL sent its drivers out to make deliveries in New York City
via the subway on Jan. 9 until the driving restrictions were
lifted, says DHL spokesperson David Fonkalsrud. 
      TNT Express Worldwide rerouted all international shipments
from JFK International Airport to Miami International until JFK
services resumed on Jan. 10.
      "We faced the obvious problems of finding lift to the Far
East due to flight cancellations," says Michael Tomasulo, Air
Express International director of airline gateways, North America.
"Our commercial customers understand what we were up against and
carriers were very good about honoring our lift allocations." AEI
was still struggling with backlog from a very heavy December when
the storm hit, but says operations were back to normal by the
middle of last week.

FAA RETRACTS FREIGHTER CONVERSION KIT CERTIFICATION, ISSUES AD 

      The Federal Aviation Administration retracted a previously
approved modification kit which converts a passenger Boeing 747 aircraft
into a freighter. The airworthiness directive, issued Jan. 3, impacts 10
Boeing 747-100s and -200s operated by four carriers, all converted by
San Francisco-based GATX Airlog. The AD, citing defective main deck
floors and inadequately constructed doors, requires the carriers to
modify the aircraft to meet the revised FAA standards by Jan. 30 or be
forced to halve the payload now carried by the aircraft. The four
airlines affected by the AD -- Evergreen Airlines, Tower Air, American
International Airways and Polar Air -- all have plans to modify the
aircraft to meet the revised standards before the end of the month and
have the aircraft back in service carrying full payloads of cargo. The
new weight limitations would reduce the 747's payload from 
220,000 pounds to 120,000 pounds, making the aircraft nearly
impossible to operate economically.
      The issue of the 747 cargo door is not new. GATX and the
airlines have been engaged in dialogue  with the FAA for more than
a year. 
    "This has taken on a life bigger than most ADs, even more than
those of a more serious nature," says Rick Hatton, president of
GATX Airlog. "The need to make some corrections along the way is
like any other AD. The fact the FAA continues to hammer the safety
points is unfounded, but it's their prerogative and has nothing to
do with structure," he adds. "In fact, the incidents all validate
the strength of the structure." 
    "Our analysis failed to show that all of the points around the
door meet 150% of the required FAA standard. We don't think it's a
safety-related issue, but it was easier to fix it than to fight
it." 
    GATX Airlog, whose only business is modifying 747s to
freighters, received FAA approval to begin modifications in 1988.
The firm is finishing its 23rd of the type this month. 
    GATX is supplying the four carriers with the materials to make
the modifications and procedures for the aircraft. Once all aircraft
modifications are complete, Hatton says, the FAA will most likely
terminate the AD before it takes effect. 
    American International Airways expects its two 747-100s to be
down for about 10 days to undergo the modification beginning Jan.
10, says Bill Gray, AIA vice president and general manager. "For
us, the first quarter is always slower so this is the time to do
the modification," he says. Gray qualified the modification as "the
cost of doing business," adding he expects the modifications to cost
between $150,000 and $200,000, not including loss of business. 
    Tower Air anticipates the modification to take four days and it
is scheduled to be completed by its own maintenance staff by the
end of the month.  
    Polar Air is making the changes during its routine maintenance
which had already been scheduled for this month for the two
affected aircraft, says Polar Air spokesperson Catherine West. The
airline plans for both aircraft to be fixed and approved by the end
of January. "Although, there is any real proof of the problems,
there is enough of a risk that the carriers want to take care of
it," she adds.
    Calls to Evergreen were not returned at press time.

FOUR INFLIGHT INCIDENTS ON RECORD 

    Operators of the 10 affected aircraft have reported four
inflight incidents that have resulted in substantial structural
damage. GATX and the carriers maintain that the incidents have
nothing to do with the way the aircraft was modified. The incident
reports include: a 3.0g dive maneuver, which was successfully
recovered by the pilot; a total engine separation due to departure
into known turbulence; an uncontained engine failure which resulted
in wing and fuselage damage; and a severe landing that resulted in
a 40-foot by 3-foot hole in the fuselage. 
    The FAA is accepting responsibility for the matter, saying it
issued the certification in error and has since streamlined its
certification process for cargo equipment, moving the process to its
Northwest regional office. 
    The FAA found that a payload reduction was the only way to make
the aircraft safe under adverse conditions. It intends to
investigate other types of loading conditions to determine whether
additional operational limitations must be imposed to address the
structural inadequacies of the main deck floor and other areas that
have not yet been identified. Although the action is a final rule,
comments are invited. The deadline is March 4.

FEDEX INDIA PLANS AIR SERVICE, AWARDS CONTRACT FOR CARGO CONVERSIONS

    Blue Dart Express, FedEx's exclusive agent in India, is getting
into the airline business. Already the largest air express company
in India, Blue Dart will be the first carrier to operate jet
freighters in the country. The firm bought two Boeing 737-200s from
Air India for $4 million, which are now being converted into
freighters by Georgia-based Stambaugh Aviation. Air services are
slated to begin in March. 
     Bombay-based Blue Dart, with revenues of $27.7 million in 1995
and expected revenues of more than $40 million this year, was the
first company to be given permission from the Indian government to
operate air cargo services in the country. To date, the company has
acted as FedEx's India agent as well as a domestic courier.    
    "It has always been Blue Dart's vision to set up a domestic
express aviation service with its own fleet of aircraft but this
could only be done when the Indian government deregulated the
aviation industry about three years ago," Diwaker Singh, senior vice
president, marketing and commercial tells ACR. With sites set on
providing a total transportation and logistical solutions for
companies such as GE, Motorola, IBM, Ford and Sony which have
factories in the country, Singh is confident that Blue Dart "will
revolutionize the way that distribution is currently done in the
country." 
    The 737 will carry eight pallets of cargo once the conversion is
complete. Singh is initially targeting door-to-door express cargo
with heavy cargo treated as filler. The long-term objective is very
clear, he says. Blue Dart is positioning itself to be "an
integrated express door-to-door package mover." Blue Dart already
holds a 26% market share in India and Singh only sees that figure
rising. Once air services begin, he predicts revenues increasing by
about 100% by 1997. 
    "The fact that they are adding air service will certainly
improve our domestic network," says FedEx spokesperson Cliff Morley.
"But FedEx service levels will remain the same, unless, of course,
they improve their transit times." 
    Competition in cargo is fierce, but thanks to the sheer size of
the country and often undependable service, Singh sees the chance to
enter the fray as a "great opportunity." To date, the only domestic
air competition Blue Dart faces is from United Parcel Service
affiliate, Elbee Lmt., which currently operates four Fokker F27
turboprops. Singh expects to add a third 737 in about six months
and possibly more, depending on market demand.

AIRBORNE BUYS BOEING 767s; PART OF $600 MILLION AIRCRAFT COMMITMENT

    Airborne Express is buying 12 used Boeing 767-200s, as part of a
$600 million long-term decision to add wide-bodied aircraft to its
growing fleet of 109 planes. Following a year-long study, Airborne
chose the 767 over both the Airbus A300B4 and the McDonnell Douglas
DC-10-10.
    Nine of the 12 will be acquired from Itochu Air Lease Corp.,
with the remaining three from Marubeni Corp. Airborne lists the
purchase price, plus spares and major modification to cargo
configuration, at $290 million.
    Airborne is completing the conversion at its airline hub
facility in Wilmington, Ohio. Airborne, which does not create a side
loading door but loads with special containers through the passenger
door, is able to save a significant amount of money on the
conversions. The first conversion is expected to begin in April and
enter the fleet about seven months later.  
    The 767s will be a net gain of 12 aircraft for Airborne. The
carrier, on some its heavier routes, plans to replace DC-8s with
the 767s where upgrades are merited. The DC-8s will move to new
routes or a second aircraft will be added where certain city pairs
need two flights.   
    Airborne also plans to acquire 10 to 15 more 767-200s in the
next eight years at a total cost of $310 million. The first two
767s will arrive in 1997, followed by four in '98, four in '99 and
two in 2000. The 
move "should decrease operating costs while keeping capital
requirements relatively unchanged," the airline says.
    The 767 has many operating advantages over other aircraft of the
same size, mostly due to newer, fuel-efficient engines and a two-
person crew. Airborne figures its 767s will have a 14% lower direct
operating cost per hour than the DC-8, 17% less than the A300 and
43% less than the DC-10-10.
    Several factors in Airborne's decision were to acquire aircraft
that could serve markets that it is outgrowing with DC-8s, as well
as the ability to fly unrestricted transcontinental payloads at a
utilization rate of at least 12 hours a day. 
    The cargo airline also incorporated environmental factors in its
decision, telling ACR that the 767 has the lowest nitrous oxide
emissions of any candidate aircraft, 17% lower than the A300B4 and
48% less than the DC-10-10.
    Airborne now operates a fleet of 63 DC-9s, 35 DC-8s and 11 YS-
11s. The carrier says it has no plans to retire any aircraft as a
result of the purchase decision, and has been adding eight to 10
DC-9s and DC-8s annually and plans to continue that rate.

FAA, AIRLINES BEGIN TESTING BOMB-RESISTANT CARGO CONTAINERS

    Some of the nations's largest airlines will participate in an
FAA program to test baggage and cargo containers that can withstand
an explosion like the one that downed Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.
    The program, scheduled to begin in June and run through 1997,
will collect cost and performance data so that the FAA can
determine whether to mandate use of the containers, says Ken Hacker,
the agency's aircraft hardening program manager. The $5 million
program will demonstrate the cost to airlines of maintaining the
hardened containers and how well their blast-resistant properties
hold up under repeated use on flights. 
    Unlike current containers, which can still be used after
incurring minor damage from routine handling, hardened containers
will have stricter standards. The operational testing will help the
FAA answer questions from the U.S. Congress about the cost-benefit
tradeoff between explosives detection and aircraft hardening, Hacker
says. Increased blast resistance within an aircraft reduces the need
to detect smaller and smaller amounts of explosives. Research
sponsored by the FAA Technical Center has shown that it is feasible
to contain an explosion within a cargo container. 
    The FAA is considering requiring hardened cargo containers to
hold mail or electronic equipment, or for aircraft that fly in
areas in which a security threat exists. Hardened containers protect
an aircraft's fuselage by absorbing some of the pressure of an
explosion and venting the rest into the cargo compartment or
adjacent containers at a manageable rate. They also weigh more.
    While airlines are interested in enhancing safety, they are
concerned about the cost and extra weight of hardened containers,
says Trans World Airlines spokesman John McDonald.
    But research is being done to develop a hardened container
weighing 250 pounds, says the FAA's Hacker. Aluminum containers now
in use weigh 150 to 250 pounds. Mass-produced hardened containers
are expected to cost $3,000 or more. Aluminum containers cost $1,500
to $2,000.
    Another concern of airlines is the limited applicability of
hardened containers. The prototype containers, which conform to LD-3
cargo container standards, are only used on widebody aircraft. Cargo
moving on narrowbody aircraft is usually not containerized. American
Airlines Cargo  spokesman Ed Martelle pointed out that 68% of his
carrier's fleet are narrowbody aircraft and could not use the
hardened containers.He also worries about terrorists' response to
the use of hardened containers. They likely would turn their efforts
away from international flights, which are served by widebody
aircraft, and target the U.S. and European markets, which are more
likely to be served by narrowbody aircraft, he says.
    The FAA next month will choose several companies to supply 10 to
20 containers for the tests. American Airlines, TWA and Delta Air
Lines will be among the first airlines to use the containers on
scheduled passenger flights in May or June. 
    The prototype containers, which conform to LD-3 cargo container
standards, will be placed on Boeing and McDonnell Douglas widebody
aircraft. Cargo carriers will also be included in the program to
see how different operating conditions affect the containers'
performance.
    Based on the feedback it receives from the participating
airlines, the FAA will ask vendors to modify the containers and may
also select additional manufacturers later this year.

CARGO STOCKS UP 26%, GAIN $1.83 BILLION IN 1995

    The parent corporations of eight cargo carriers surveyed by ACR
picked up an average of 26% in share value during 1995, for a gain
in market value of nearly $2 billion. 
    Fritz Companies, with 17 acquisitions in 1995, was the biggest
proportionate winner, with its common shares rising 77% on the
exchange. Airborne Freight and FedEx also picked up value
significantly, with share gains of more than 20%
    Other increases were more modest, but it was the increase across
the board that best indicates the improved market climate of 1995.
None of the eight publicly-traded companies lost ground.
    The largest absolute increase in shareholder value belonged to
FedEx, which got through a delayed opening of its Philippines hub
and a late-year labor quarrel in decent enough shape to post a
$762-million increase in market worth. Next was Fritz Companies,
much smaller than FedEx, which registered a $455-million gain.
    At yearend, FedEx, Fritz, and Burlington Air Express's parent
Pittston Services Group [PZS] were all worth more than $1 billion
on equity markets. The eight-company group as a whole was worth
$8.89 
billion Dec. 31, or about 30% of the U.S. major passenger airlines'
value.

CARGO NEWS BRIEFS

* United Parcel Service provided all of the transportation needed to
move, Keiko, the whale star of "Free Willy" from Mexico City to
Oregon last week. The transportation, at an estimated cost of
$250,000, included flying Keiko from Mexico to Newport, Ore., on a
C-130, then moving him over-ground in a roller-bed trailer to the
Oregon Coast Aquarium. Newport's runway is less than 6,000 feet, too
short for a Boeing 747, so UPS held on to the C-130 chartered for
late December to carry the whale. The aircraft, carrying a 42,000
pound payload, made two technical stops on the 8.5 hour flight --
one in Monterrey, Mexico and the other in Phoenix for U.S. Customs
clearance. More than 350 media representatives were there to meet
the aircraft, painted in UPS livery for the event.
    UPS will introduce distance-based pricing for its air express
service on Feb. 3. Under the new structure U.S. zip codes are
divided into seven regions and priced according to weight and
distance. Prior to the change, pricing was based on weight only.
Relying less on its Louisville hub and more on its five regional
sort hubs, the company maintains that more efficient sorting will
lead to shorter distances the packages will travel. Rates for
commercial standard ground shipments will increase an average of
2.9%; 3.9% for residential shipments; next day and second day air
4.9% and three-day select 3.9%. International shipments originating
in the U.S. will increase an average of 4.9% and international
express by 6.9%.
 
* Lufthansa Cargo and South African Airways Cargo have been jointly
operating four weekly Boeing 747 freighters since Oct. 1, but
further cooperation is imminent. The two airlines recently signed a
new codesharing pact which will provide more lift between Germany
and South Africa with 29 weekly passenger flights, while stepping up
cooperative efforts in cargo handling and automation. 
 
* Kintetsu World Express has expanded its operations to include
Chile, Colombia, Panama and Peru. KWE Latin America provides door-
to-door service, including forwarding, warehousing and distribution,
inventory control and other logistics services. Kintetsu also was
awarded ISO 9002 certification in its Boston office.

* Air Express International has integrated its LOGIS automation
system into an e-mail address on the Internet. This is the first
step toward a World Wide Web home page, expected to be online later
this quarter. It allows customers without a hard link to AEI to
track shipments and communicate with the company, says AEI
spokesperson Candace Brouchard. 

* Expeditors International selected Transworld M. Mordehay & Sons as
its customs broker and international cargo agent for air and ocean
imports and exports in Israel. 

* ValuJet launched its new counter-to-counter small package service
throughout its 26-city network late last month. ValuJet's Small
Package (VSP) is scanned and barcoded upon check-in and re-scanned
at transfer points and its final destination. All scanned
information is transferred to a help desk at the airline's Atlanta
headquarters. Shipments are restricted to 50 pounds and dimensions
can not exceed a total of 90 inches per piece. Prices start at $29
or 69 cents per pound. 

* Sierra Expressway Airlines introduced a new counter-to-counter
express package service called Expressway Pack. The Oakland, Calif.-
based airlines flies to five cities in the Northwest with Jetstream
31 turboprop aircraft. Documents begin at $17.50, while packages up
to 25 pounds are $35 and to 50 pounds are $50.     

* Evergreen International Airlines, making avionics history, flew
around the world using a Boeing 747 navigated completely by a GPS
system. The system, a Canard Aerospace/Trimble 8100, was granted
supplemental type certification by the Federal Aviation
Administration following the flight which left New York's JFK
International Airport on Dec. 22 and returned on Dec. 25. 

* United Airlines ordered two new Boeing 747-400s for delivery in
1997, bringing the carrier's total to 28 of the cargo-friendly
aircraft. United will take delivery of two 747-400s this year and
retire three 747-100s. 

* Fritz Companies' Rochester, N.Y. office has been given a free
trade zone designation by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The
designation allows the location to be treated as though it exists
outside the U.S., employing increased flexibility in storage,
inspection, repackaging and labeling.

UAL CARGO DENVER FACES TOUGH COMPETITION FROM TRUCKERS

    DENVER -- United Airlines Cargo's operation at Denver
International Airport has experienced a mix of improvements and
problems since its move from Stapleton International almost a year
ago. Although the cargo facilities are larger -- with a net gain of
22,000 square feet of space and better equipped -- it is located
three and a half miles from the main terminal making last minute
additions a near impossibility. The one-way tug ride from South
Service Center to the terminal takes a minimum of 20 minutes.
Operational costs have more than tripled at the new airport, but
Dick Martino, United's manager for cargo services, maintains it is
still a profitable station. 
    The Denver operation is the fourth largest in United's domestic
system in terms of volume. It is also the most technologically
advanced. Yet growth opportunities look dim for heavy freight. "We
are really struggling with a diminishing manufacturing base because
most area companies are paper-based," Martino says. 
    Calling trucks his most fervent competitor, Martino says the
airlines and truckers go head-to-head for shipments destined within
a 500 mile radius of the airport. "Truckers have really learned to
do business," Martino says. "On the rate side they have always been
there, but they are becoming much smarter and better automated." 
    Still, air cargo in Denver managed 16% growth in 1995.
Agricultural products are a mainstay for the Denver operation,
namely beef from Nebraska, Iowa and Colorado headed for the Far
East. United's Small Package Dispatch (SPD) also is gaining ground.
SPD pieces travel in the baggage mode, can not exceed 70 pounds and
receive same-day service. Denver posted a record month for SPD in
October with more than 1 million pounds shipped. An average month
is closer to between 300,000 and 500,000 pounds. 
    The U.S. mail is also big business for United's Denver Cargo
operation. United carries 70% of the U.S. mail in Denver and is the
only carrier with a direct link to the U.S. Postal Service
facility. 
    Denver is really a trucking market for United, Martino says. And
it is forced to be because 80% of the aircraft United flies into
the market are narrowbodies typically filled with passengers,
baggage and ski equipment in the winter months, not leaving much
room for cargo. In the summer, Denver is plagued by thin air and
high temperatures, which proves to be an impossible combination for
freight because the aircraft is invariably weight restricted. Twenty
of the 270 daily United flights from Denver are served with
widebodies. United's largest port at Chicago O'Hare International
has the same fleet mix, Martino says, because the widebodies are
relegated to the coasts for international flights.

CATHAY PACIFIC TAPS BOEING TO MODIFY THREE 747s TO ALL-CARGO 

     Cathay Pacific gave Boeing's Wichita Division a contract to
modify three Boeing 747-200 combi aircraft into full cargo
configuration for lease to Air Hong Kong. Cathay, which owns 75% of
the all-cargo carrier, purchased the aircraft from Brazilian carrier
Varig S.A. The aircraft will replace Air Hong Kong's present pair
of leased 747 freighters. Air Hong Kong flies to Manchester,
England, Brussels and Nagoya, Japan. The Nagoya route will be moved
to Osaka in March and the carrier plans to add a new trans-Pacific
route when the third aircraft enters the fleet.

COMPETITION IS FIERCE FOR LUXEMBOURG'S CARGOLUX


 By Bruce Barnard, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Cargolux, Europe's largest all-cargo carrier, doesn't have to
look too far to see the enemy.
     Within a 300-mile radius of its home base at Luxembourg airport are some
of the biggest players in the air freight business: scheduled carriers
Lufthansa, Air France, KLM and British Airways which have made cargo a core
operation. Federal Express, UPS and DHL planes also are flying into airports
less than a day's truck drive away, underlining the new challengers in the
battle for European cargo.
     Heiner Wilkens, president and chief executive officer of Cargolux,
meanwhile, insists the company is nimble enough to survive. The headline
figures show Cargolux is more than keeping pace with the competition. Last
year, it moved up three places to 17th in the world air freight rankings, and
to No.5 in Europe pushing ahead of both Swissair and Alitalia.
     Cargolux's bottom line also is looking a lot healthier after the savage
recession of 1992-93. A $4.88 million operating loss in 1993 was transformed
into a $10.7 million profit in 1994 as revenues surged to $307 million from
$241 million and traffic was up 39 percent at a record 182,000 tons.
     The surge continued in 1995 with an operating profit of between $16
million and $17 million.
     Mr. Wilkens arrived in May 1995 when Cargolux was on a roll, celebrating
its 25th year in business. In September it took delivery of its third Boeing
747-400 freighter -- a fourth is due in 1998 -- and was involved in the
negotiations for an "open skies" pact between Luxembourg and the United
States. And the market is booming, noted Mr. Wilkens, with a load factor in
excess of 90 percent.
     But he doesn't minimize the size of the task facing Cargolux. "To
maintain our existing market share we must grow every three years by an
amount equivalent to the capacity of one 747 freighter."
     This search for cargo is taking place in a fast changing environment.
Carriers like KLM say there will be at most three of four dedicated scheduled
cargo airlines by the turn of the century. Lufthansa and KLM are getting
closer to their big corporate customers to provide door-to-door transport and
logistics services, inevitably bypassing freight forwarders. Meanwhile, the
integrators are moving increasingly into markets that were once the preserve
of all-cargo and scheduled carriers.
     Mr. Wilkens isn't fazed. "We are a forwarders' airline. We will
concentrate on our core (air freight) business and trucking.
     "We don't want to go into the business of the forwarders...they are our
partners. As long as they don't want to get into the airline business we
won't go into theirs."
     In time, Cargolux could form alliances with some big freight forwarders,
but it will stick to what it does best -- hauling freight. That's why it
decided last June to go ahead with a $100 million plus order for a Boeing
747-400F.
     Mr. Wilkens, a 30-year veteran of the industry, doesn't think the
integrators provide the only viable strategy for the future.
     Forwarders, he said, can give customers services the integrators cannot.
An example: If a U.S. computer company wants to get components to a plant in
Europe by a certain date, a forwarder can arrange for cheaper sea transport
if the delivery schedule is known in advance.
     So far, Cargolux is staying ahead of the game with a 37 percent increase
in freight ton kilometers, more than double the industrywide growth of 15
percent. Its seven Boeings serve a network that spans the globe, and the
Asia-Pacific region, the fastest growing air freight market in the world,
generated 44 percent of its revenue last year.
     Cargolux also intends to build Luxembourg airport into a key European
hub. In March, it will open a new 50,000-square meter cargo terminal which
will double capacity to 500,000 tons a year. The warehouse cannot open soon
enough, with Cargolux fast running out of space. Last year air freight
traffic surged by nearly 37 percent to 252,000 tons, making this small
airport the 8th largest air freight center in Europe.
     Despite the bumper figures, Cargolux must continue its "relentless"
pursuit of cost cutting, according to Mr. Wilkens. Cargolux is a tight
operation with just 735 staff, of which around 550 are based in Luxembourg.
But it must boost productivity at one of the higher cost bases in the world
to compete against the low cost Asian and U.S. carriers. One way to remain
competitive is by flying the most efficient aircraft in the world. The lower
operating costs of the 747-400 more than outweighs the $105 million price
tag. "The 747-400 freighter has given us a clear edge in the market," Mr.
Wilkens.
     Industry executives say Cargolux has a gold plated guarantee of survival
in the 24.5 percent share held since 1987 by Lufthansa, the world's second
largest air freight operator, after Federal Express.
     There has been speculation in the industry that Lufthansa is keen to
take control of Cargolux to add an all-cargo arm to its freight operation
just as it added an integrator with the joint purchase with Japan Air Lines
of a controlling stake in DHL, the express and courier operator.
     For the time being, Mr, Wilkens "totally rules out" a takeover by
Lufthansa. It's been a good investment for Lufthansa, he says, yield an
average 5 percent return compared with 3 percent from Lufthansa's recently
independent cargo unit.
     The two carriers have a hands off relationship, focusing mainly on ways
to jointly have costs, for example, by sharing warehouses. Lufthansa also
books space on Cargolux's planes.
     Cargolux's local shareholders, Luxair SA, the national airline, and a
couple of Luxembourg banks, would also balk at letting go of the company.
"There's a national feeling about Cargolux. We are the big intercontinental
carrier for Luxembourg," Mr. Wilkens said. Indeed, Cargolux planes are the
most visible symbol around the world of this tiny nation of 370,000
inhabitants.
     Sometimes, it pays to operate out of a small country. Thus Cargolux
provided four of the six people in the Luxembourg team that negotiated the
open-skies agreement with the United States that came into force last June.
     The payoff for Cargolux came within days of the signing of the accord.
For the first time it was able to pick up local freight in Mexico for
transport to Seattle on its regular Luxembourg-Mexico-Seattle run.
     The battle for freight, however, is also being waged on the ground, with
air cargo companies battling the increasing challenge from door-to-door
integrators.
     Much of that battle is being fought on Europe's freeways where all the
major carriers are trucking cargo from all over the continent to their hubs.
Cargolux is keeping pace with the competition, with scheduled trucks carrying
bulk and containerized freight between Luxembourg airport and 35 airports in
Europe. Non-scheduled trucks operate services to over 80 other cities in
Europe. Last year. Cargolux's freight traffic rose by over 30 percent.
     In the air the toughest competition comes from subsidized European
carriers dumping freight rates and more scheduled carriers getting back into
freight to exploit the current boom. There is also the end of the tight air
freight capacity with the new Boeing 777s coming into service offering the
same capacity as a Boeing 747-100.
     But there will always be new business, according to Mr. Wilkens.
Computer companies are shipping components from manufacturing facilities all
over the world to a small number of assembly plants. And markets are forever
evolving: Ten years ago, Cargolux's business out of Italy was almost all
shoes and clothing. Today fashion makes up only 25 percent of its cargo, the
bulk now consisting of machinery, chemicals, auto parts, computers, printers,
telex machines and electronic goods.

SHIPMENT OF FRUIT BY AIR VS. WATER: DECISION HINGES ON THREE FACTORS


 By Michael Goldstein, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Two hundred years ago, sailors died of scurvy if they couldn't get the
vitamin C from fruit that they needed. Voyages were long, ships were slow,
and fruit rotted without refrigeration. In an era of moldy hardtack, spoiled
beef and salt pork, the idea of shipping perishable produce from one country
to another was as alien as the thought of living on Jupiter.
     Thankfully, there's been plenty of progress since. From delicate
cherries and plums to fragile fresh flowers, highly perishable produce
routinely travel by air and sea to hungry markets a continent away. What
determines whether produce goes by air or ocean?
     Ron Rembaum, general manager for refrigerated cargo services at Maersk
Line, says, "At this point, the vast majority of fresh produce, everything
from bananas to cherries, can go by ocean. The only cargo that's really going
by air is the fruit that's most perishable. Berries do not move by water. If
it's sold as tree-ripened, like cherries from Chile, it goes by air. But
virtually everything else goes by ocean."
     Ocean freight rates for perishables should remain stable this year due
to increased competition from independent carriers like Hanjin Shipping Co.,
Hyundai Merchant Marine and Evergreen Marine Corp., all of which have made
big investments in fleets and reefer containers, he said.
     But revenue should grow about 5 percent due to higher volume, Mr.
Rembaum added. "The demand just keeps growing. Reefer cargo (like produce) is
the cream of the crop, and it pays more than dry container, so we've placed
our resources there."
     Air freight may be more expensive, but often it's the only way to ship
produce when it absolutely, positively has to be there on time.
"Perishability is the No. 1 reason, plus the value, because air freight is so
much more expensive," the Maersk executive said.
     "Some commodities can't go by air because of the price. Most fruits and
vegetables do not carry a high profit margin," he added. "Apples may be
high-volume, but not high-margin, and that rules out air shipping."
     Dave Moore, executive vice president of Raymond Express, a freight
forwarder in South San Francisco, Calif., that specializes in perishables,
said the commodities most likely to be shipped by air are the most
perishable, like cherries or strawberries.
     "These products can't go by ocean, where it's a long trip of 10 or more
days to the destination, so there'll be no shelf life when they get there."
     Market demand is the other key variable determining whether a product
goes by air or sea. That's especially true when the harvest has just begun
because demand is high and supply is low, he said, adding that fruit shipped
at the start of the season can command a premium price that will more than
pay for shipping costs.
     Ocean carriers are deploying a not-so-secret anti-aircraft weapon in the
form of controlled-atmosphere containers, which can slow the ripening process
and preserve fruits better than refrigeration alone.
     "Controlled atmosphere makes ocean even more competitive with air, but
everything relates to cost," said Mr. Rembaum of Maersk. But this method
costs the shipper over $1,000 additional per container.
     While the new technology hasn't caught on as rapidly as its developers
had hoped, it's becoming more and more common. A key reason is to cut down on
claims from the shipper.
     "We will not accept certain cargoes if we don't think they'll arrive
safely. If commodities like avocados or bananas have a transit time of 20
days, we think it will turn out badly, and we'll turn it down," the Maersk
official said. "When we carry plums or peaches from Chile to the Far East, we
will not accept them without controlled atmosphere. CA is extra insurance for
shipper, grower, and line, but the grower and shipper will have to pass along
the extra cost. And some produce, like citrus or apples, don't work under
controlled atmosphere all that well."
     Mr. Moore of Raymond Express notes that air freight tonnage, especially
to the Far East, has been consistently growing. While Hong Kong and Singapore
have slightly declined, other Asian markets, like Japan, are stable while
others are growing far faster than the European market.
     "Indonesia, and Thailand are increasing, with their increase in
disposable income, the lowering of tariffs, and the consumer's attraction to
fresh, healthy, foods," he said.
     Air freight rates to Asia have increased by 10 percent to 15 percent
over the past year because of strong demand and limited space for cargo on
passenger flights due to higher passenger travel. If prices get too high,
more traffic will move by ocean, Mr. Moore said. "The European market, for
example, except for the most highly perishable products, has flipped towards
ocean," he said. "The plum business used to be an air business, but now has
mostly flipped towards ocean, except for early harvest."
     Because air rates are so high, and because the demand is there, Mr.
Moore believes some ocean carriers may be able to raise rates. But, he adds,
"if the market continues strong, the carriers will add additional flights.
Eventually, the cycle will turn."
     Bill Spohrer, president of Miami-based Challenge Air Cargo, which
primarily ships to and from Latin America, said he expects rates there to
remain stable. That is helping Challenge's business, which is growing both
southbound and northbound, he said.
     Challenge's top item is fresh-cut flowers from South America, which have
a very limited shelf life and need to go by air.
     Ocean carriers are becoming more competitive with produce, he said,
noting that they recently dropped rates into Central America by 25 percent.
     "As various countries in Latin America improve their ports and roads,
maritime will play a bigger role. We move a tremendous amount of fresh
asparagus out of Peru.
     Some is now going by ship, which never happened before two years ago.
But the lion's share still goes by air, because it arrives in better shape
and much faster. Everyone wants everything yesterday." As ports are upgraded
to use technologies like controlled atmosphere, and faster ships come on
line, air carriers more efficient, and they'll offer better service. There
will always be a difference in price, but the air carriers can grow more
efficient."

PEACE DIVIDEND FOR ISRAEL? A MAJOR REGIONAL AIR CARGO HUB


 By Phillip Hastings, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--The Promised Land may hold more promise than ever, as world
leaders raise the possibility of an accord between Israel and Syria. The
continuation of the Middle East peace process could pave the way for Israel
to become a significant air cargo hub for the entire region.
     The country might also have a similar role to play in servicing other
neighboring regional markets such as the eastern Mediterranean and parts of
the former Soviet Union. That, at least, is the optimistic view of local
Israeli air cargo industry executives.
     There are, of course, major stumbling blocks on the political front. A
peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993 and with Jordan
in 1994, has still to be followed by an end to the official state of war
still existing between Israel and Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.
     And while there is a momentum toward a settlement with Lebanon and
Syria, not even the most hopeful observers envisage a settlement with Iraq
while Saddam Hussein is still in power in Baghdad.
     If peace does come to the region, Israel will have to invest heavily --
and soon -- to expand its main airport and the nation's general transport
infrastructure.
     To that end, Israeli officials have earmarked $1 billion over the next
four years to Israeli ports, to allow them to rival in size the Persian Gulf
ports of Jebel Ali and Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
     Israel's basic underlying geographical advantage when it comes to
international trade and freight gateway activities is spotlighted by Michael
Mayer, cargo division director for El Al Israel Airlines.
     "If you look at a map you can see that Israel lies on a straight line
between key Southeast Asian centers like Singapore and much of Europe," he
said.
     The urgent need for further investment to enable Israel to exploit that
geographical advantage, though, is highlighted by the situation at its main
international air cargo gateway, Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport.
     According to figures supplied by cargo handling company and terminal
operator Maman, annual air cargo traffic growth has averaged 8.6 percent over
the last five years. The final total for 1995 is expected to reach around
190,000 metric tons -- more than double the 1985 figure of 92,000 metric
tons. And that sort of growth, Maman said, is putting the airport's
cargo-handling facilities under pressure.
     "The number of cargo movements has increased to the point where we are
now having some difficulties giving the right levels of service to our
customers. We are short of facilities and need further expansion," admitted
Maman's senior deputy managing director, Isaac Tomer.
     Maman is hoping to get the go-ahead shortly for construction of a new
$50 million cargo terminal. The 30,000-square-meter facility, which will
virtually double the amount of cargo-handling space available, forms part of
a general "Airport 2000" expansion project at Tel Aviv that also includes
plans for a new passenger terminal.
     However, Maman said precise timing of the new cargo sector development
will be governed to some extent by recent court hearings into objections from
environmentalists.
     "We have the plans and the budget for the new cargo terminal project but
we do not yet have the land," Mr. Tomer said.
     "We hope to get that land by around May this year, with construction of
the building and systems completed by the end of 1997. That may be a little
optimistic, though." Current facilities include a main cargo terminal for
both imports and exports of 27,000 square meters, supported by two other
sheds of 6,000 square meters (for import consolidations) and 4,500 square
meters (exports and courier traffic) respectively. In addition, Agrexco
(Agricultural Export Company) operates a 5,000-square-meter terminal for
agricultural produce exports.
     Once the planned new cargo terminal becomes operational, Maman said, the
existing main building will be used solely for handling imports.
     Provided that development goes ahead -- and more Arab countries sign air
transport agreements with Israel -- Mr. Tomer believes Tel Aviv could become
increasingly interesting to international airlines as a potential regional
hub.
     "We have an advantage here in terms of position and direction. Airlines
flying into the Middle East from Europe and North America, for example, could
shorten their flying time by hubbing via Israel," he suggested.
     El Al's Mr. Mayer believes there are also opportunities for
transshipping air cargo moving between Western Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
     "It can make sense to route cargo from Western Europe to southern parts
of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States), for example, via Israel. It
is not too much of a detour and there are a growing number of air services
between Tel Aviv and southern CIS points," he said.
     In that context, Mr. Mayer believes that the commonwealth states are
already emerging as a potentially important cargo market for El Al. "The
closest place in Russia, for example, is only two and a half hours' flying
time away from here," he said.
     El Al currently operates scheduled passenger flights to Moscow and St.
Petersburg, using both Boeing 747 and 767 aircraft with bellyhold cargo
capacity. It also is looking at other service development possibilities in
southern parts of the commonwealth.
     In March the airline is due to increase to twice-weekly its weekly 767
service from Tel Aviv to Tashkent in Uzbekistan. That move would put El Al on
a par with Uzbekistan Airlines, which already operates twice-weekly flights
on the same route.
     However, if Israel is to develop a general air cargo transshipment role
for the Middle East region, Mr. Mayer warned, then the country will need to
upgrade its rail and road connections substantially.
     "For example, the development of land links between Israel and Jordan
would open up the possibility of moving Jordanian air freight via Israel," he
said.
     Such development is already under way. At the beginning of the year,
Israel and Jordan agreed to allow their commercial trucks to cross each
other's territory. The same wide-ranging transport agreement also paves the
way for the introduction of direct air links between the two countries.
     The real prize, though, said the chairman of the Israeli Federation of
Forwarders and Customs Clearing Agents, Amir Shani, is the hoped-for future
establishment of trucking and other transport links between Israel and Arab
countries beyond Jordan, especially those in the Persian Gulf region.
     In addition to upgrading its freight transport infrastructures in a bid
to become a more significant cargo hub, Israel also is placing considerable
emphasis on its technological capabilities, particularly in the field of
communications.
     A prime example of that is the current move to develop a community
electronic data interchange system, IFTS (Integrated Foreign Trade System),
which will electronically link importers, exporters, public and private
freight transport organizations, customs and financial institutions such as
banks, along with other overseas communication systems.
     IFTS EDI center manager Shaul Abramovich believes that development of
more sophisticated communications systems will help the general growth of
Israel as a trade center in a number of ways.
     "We can foresee the development of international multimodal transport,
with goods arriving in Israel by sea or air and then being trucked on to
neighboring countries and further afield to the gulf. That will need to be
supported by sophisticated information systems which can plan and track the
movement of cargo," he said.
     He also noted the trend among multinational manufacturers and suppliers
to establish regional distribution centers where they can hold stocks close
to their customers.
     "By developing good EDI systems, we can assist those foreign companies
establishing regional warehouses in Israel to keep in close touch with those
operations and quickly access information about stock movements and stock
replacement requirements," Mr. Abramovich added.
     Overall, though, Israeli trade and freight industry executives admitted,
the development of their country as an international cargo hub remains very
much linked to the continuation of the peace process with its Arab neighbors.
Most appear optimistic that process will continue.

JAPANESE MARKET STILL STRONG FOR U.S. GROWERS


 By Mark Magnier, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     TOKYO--Feb. 26--Imported fresh fruits and vegetables will continue to do
reasonably well in Japan's affluent and demanding market in 1996 due to
changing consumer tastes and the declining number of Japanese farmers.
     "The prospects look real good," said John Child, agriculture counselor
at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. "Farmers are getting older and vegetables are
very labor intensive, so fewer are able to do it."
     That said, the American farmer's best friend will continue to be bad
weather. Japanese demand for imported fruits and vegetables rises most
sharply in years when Japan suffers bad weather and multiple typhoons.
     The last time that happened -- 1994 -- U.S. farmers saw enormous demand
for their onions and broccoli, the two largest U.S. fresh vegetable exports
here.
     In more normal years, U.S. produce exporters to Japan can expect
moderate growth.
     Japan's total imports of fresh fruits and vegetables from all sources in
1995 were estimated at $2.6 billion, compared with $2.37 billion in 1994.
     Fresh vegetables showed the strongest growth as Japanese consumers
respond to vegetables' perceived health benefits. Fruit -- which has seen
relatively little growth -- evidently doesn't have the same reputation.
     "Japanese fresh fruit consumption is modestly declining in favor of
juice," Mr. Child said.
     The United States, meanwhile, expects final figures for 1995 will show
total vegetable exports to Japan of $259 million, up $6 million over 1994.
The relatively small increase is partially explained by the huge jump in
import demand in 1994, which proved difficult to match. The United States
supplies approximately 29 percent of Japan's fresh imported vegetables.
     U.S. fresh fruit should see a healthy $864 million in total 1995 Japan
sales compared with $785 million in 1994.
     A year ago, the first shipment of Washington state apples in 24 years
arrived in Japan with great fanfare. But the great expectations that
Washington growers held for Japan have failed to materialize as demand has
proven to be rather mild. Japanese consumers, it turns out, find Washington
apples aren't sweet enough.
     In addition, Japan is still not ready to open its market to fresh
tomatoes grown in the United States, according to officials from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
     Concerns about a plant disease called the tobacco blue mold have held up
approval of U.S. tomato imports. U.S. tomato growers, however, argue that
Japan's domestic tomato industry would face no risk of a blue mold
infestation from imports of U.S. tomatoes. Washington may take the case to
the World Trade Organization.
     Nonetheless, U.S. officials in Japan say Japanese consumers are shedding
some of their traditional distrust of foreign farm products, which have
suffered from a perception that they contain more chemicals and harmful
additives than domestic varieties.
     Some U.S. products, like cherries, broccoli and asparagus, are now
mainstays in Japanese supermarkets.
     That's not to say domestic resistence to farm imports has disappeared --
particularly when it involves products as emotional to the Japanese as rice.
But some U.S. officials say domestic resistance is changing, with accusations
now more likely to come from fringe consumer groups than the farm lobbies
themselves.
     "It's still a major concern for U.S. produce suppliers," a U.S. official
said. "But it's not going to keep you out of the market."
     Other countries that have benefitted from Japanese fresh import
liberalization are China and Australia. China has done well exporting certain
Asian vegetables not widely grown by Australia or the United States.
     Australia has a seasonal advantage over the United States for fresh
fruit and vegetables. Because it's located in the Southern Hemisphere,
Australia's growing season complements rather than directly competes with
Japan's season.
     "We see good prospects for increased access and exports to this market,
particularly if Japan's economy recovers," said John Sainsbury, Australia's
agriculture counselor in Tokyo.
     On the other hand, when Japan does have a bad weather year, U.S. farmers
are in better position to take immediate advantage.
     As part of an expanded market presence, U.S. fresh produce exporters are
also trying to expand their distribution channels into this affluent market
by selling directly to regional farm cooperatives, secondary supermarket
chains and other emerging players in Japan's changing retail industry.
     U.S. farmers are also looking at new potential export products --
assuming they can get through Japan's laborious and expensive food safety
certification system. These include tomatoes, plums, new apple varieties and
peppers.
     Turning to the traditional large-volume U.S. exports to Japan, onions
saw an increase from January through October of 1995 relative to the
year-earlier period. But a slowdown in the last two months of the year means
the 1995 totals will probably be lower than last year.
     U.S. broccoli exports were up slightly to $114 million in the first 10
months of 1995 from $109.2 million in the same 1994 period.
     Two factors were at work here, U.S. officials say. Broccoli shipments
rose sharply in 1994 leading to little growth in 1995 as demand caught up
with supply. Also, higher competition toward the end of 1995, particularly
from Australia and New Zealand, meant that prices got squeezed.
     Asparagus declined in the first 10 months of 1995 to $32.9 million
compared with $33.5 million a year earlier.

MIAMI AIRPORT HELPING TO REINVENT CUSTOMS


 By Laura Myers, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     MIAMI--Feb. 26--Cutting red tape and improving automation are top
priorities for the U.S. Customs Service, and Miami International Airport is
right at the heart of those efforts.
     MIA's designation as a "reinvention lab" last fall by Vice President Al
Gore is speeding the creation of new systems to slash the time it takes
passengers and cargo to pass through Customs checkpoints.
     "We're working on every single process we have in Customs to see how to
cut down obsolete paperwork," said D. Lynn Gordon, director of the South
Florida Customs Management Center in Miami, one of 20 such U.S. centers.
     "It's a continuing process. Government resources are not getting any
greater. There's a constant need to reverse and redo, and we'll continue to
adjust. Traffic is up 10 percent to 15 percent a year here in Miami," Ms.
Gordon said.
     Part of Customs' efforts to help re-engineer the airport include
upgrading a computer system that checks passengers' names against a list of
known smugglers, terrorists or drug traffickers. Those identified through
computerization will be singled out for more thorough enforcement procedures.
Also under way is a plan to improve MIA's in-transit waiting areas for
foreign-to-foreign travel.
     "We're trying to improve communication with all inspection, airline and
airport personnel. Some of this has a lot to do with airlines and baggage
handlers or immigration. We want to make sure that everyone takes ownership
and joint risk assessments," said Jay Ahren, U.S. Customs Service Port
Director for MIA.
     As the hub for trade and travel with Latin America, MIA is poised for
continued growth as the nation's top cargo airport. International cargo last
year jumped 25 percent to just under 1.4 million tons. More than 14.4 million
international passengers traveled through the airport, a 10.2 percent
increase over 1994.
     Customs modernization changes allowed under the North American Free
Trade Agreement Implementation Act are helping to ease regulatory
requirements for the trade community.
     Customs' automated broker interface system is dramatically improving
productivity for Greyhound Leisure Services Inc., which recently renewed a
10-year contract to operate duty-free shops at the airport.
     The company has been able to eliminate 300,000 forms it previously had
to file with Customs, according to Phil Salta, customs document control
manager for Miami-based Greyhound.
     "The paperwork required by Customs is being done through more electronic
interfacing. It tremendously speeds up the availability of merchandise that
used to take six to seven days to get. Now, it's about 1.75 from the point of
entry," he said.
     Mr. Salta said that Greyhound, which sells liquor, tobacco, perfumes,
cosmetics, electronics, glassware and porcelain at MIA's duty-free shops,
will save about $300,000 during a three-year period by filing Customs forms
electronically.
     Bruce Roberts, vice president of operations for Miami International
Forwarders, which handles both air and sea cargo, said about 35 percent of
his company's 4,000 monthly clearance and follow-up entries are now
paperless.
     "The program has created benefits for us. We don't have to run out
paperwork for steamship lines, for example," Mr. Roberts said. "We can clear
and move cargo without submitting hard documentation to Customs or steamship
lines."
     Miami International Forwarders' clients include Epson Computers, Samsung
Electronics, Levi Strauss, Liz Claiborne, and Farrah.
     Customs' decision to eliminate the requirement for fences separating
domestic and bonded goods has won praise from the local trade community.
     "We had a huge number of good inside fencing. There was no need for the
physical fences and that's saved us at least $100,000. It used to be that
Customs was on Prozac, and the real driving force for change here has been
Lynn Gordon," said Raul Pedraza, president of the Eagle Cos. a Miami-based
international transportation and logistics company.
     Bonded carriers can now transport merchandise within seaport limits
without having to obtain a cartman's license, and operators of foreign trade
zones, container station and centralized examination stations and bonded
warehouse proprietors can transport merchandise to their facilities.
     "It's a form of privatization because we can transport goods under our
own bond," said Mr. Pedraza, past president of the 200-member National Bonded
Warehousing Cargo Association.
     "They've also allowed us to do entry processing electronically, all with
one check a month. It's really the first time that government has outsourced
regulations. Now, we have automated systems, with Customs in a supervisory
role. The streamlining has taken two weeks off the process and has gotten the
goods to move through the port more quickly," he said.
     Eagle has about 300 clients and $20 million in annual revenue from
handling electronics, cruise ship materials such as wines, table goods and
spare parts.
     Other Customs' streamlining efforts are continuing. Plans are under way
to redesign the agency's Automated Commercial System. Customs Commissioner
George Weiss in Washington also is seeking input from the trade community on
revising the Automated Commercial Environment User Requirements Document,
part of an overall Strategic Information Management Plan.
     In another move, U.S. Customs established five so-called Strategic Trade
Centers last October. They are located in Plantation, Fla., west of Fort
Lauderdale, as well as Chicago, Dallas, Long Beach and New York.
     "We're part of a new organization that is part of the streamlining
process. We try to ensure that there is informed compliance with importation.
It's a way of helping to protect the domestic industry," said Howard
Cooperman, deputy director of the 17-staff Plantation Strategic Trade Center.
"We're getting a much better handle on compliance rates."
     Functions of the new domestic trade offices include technical operations
and watchdogging predatory trade practices affecting the U.S. economy.
     Priorities of the five offices include embargoes, quotas, transshipments
and intellectual property rights.

JAPANESE AIR CARRIERS ADDING ROUTES


 AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways are looking to extend
their reach.
     JAL filed an application with local officials to operate flights between
Nagoya and Vancouver jointly with Canadian Airlines International, starting
April 1.
     According to the application, the two airlines plan to offer three
flights between the two cities in the first week and one more flight a week
for the period to Oct. 26. After that, they will reduce the number of flights
to two a week.
     JAL currently operates flights between Tokyo and Vancouver.
     Meanwhile, ANA submitted a plan to inaugurate a flight service between
Kansai International Airport in Osaka and Vienna on March 31 with Austrian
Airlines, ANA officials said.
     They will offer four flights a week -- two from Osaka to Vienna on
Monday and Friday and two return flights on Thursday and Sunday, each taking
about 12 hours.

AIRCOMMERCE THIS MONTH COLUMN


 AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--You know you are living in strange times when Atlanta can boast
worse winter weather than Anchorage, Israel and Jordan are deciding where to
sign a transport pact and airports are thinking of starting their own bank to
finance their needs.
     All those stories and a lot more can be found in this month's
AirCommerce.
     We begin here at home where this has truly been the winter of our
discontent. Record snows, ice storms and wind gusts that have seen
temperatures plummet to all-time lows have shown what can happen when a
creator has too many toys to play with. And yet, while bloodied and knocked
to one knee, North America's air transport system is, pardon the expression,
weathering the century's worst winter.
     Janet Plume tells how in this month's cover story, "A Winter to
Remember".
     Elsewhere, the Promised Land is looking more promising than ever. There
is a saying in the Middle East that roughly translates to "You get a chicken
by hatching the egg -- not by smashing it." It is a lesson in patience for a
region that has waited thousands of years for peace.
     Today, Israeli officials have taken a decidedly different approach, that
can best be described as "patience may be a virtue, but it will never help a
rooster lay an egg."
     Phil Hastings looks at the region's new peace initiatives and Israel's
aggressive approach to developing itself as the cargo hub for a region of
nearly 500 million residents.
     Lockheed's L-1011, once thought to be the airplane that would keep the
company in the passenger business, has found its niche as a cargo plane. Ted
Reed explains just where.
     Luxembourg's Cargolux Airlines is Europe's largest all-cargo air
carrier. It is also a company that doesn't have to go far to find the biggest
players in the air freight business looking over its shoulder, breathing down
its neck. Journal of Commerce European correspondent Bruce Barnard examines
Cargolux in "At the Center of the Storm."
     In neighboring Holland, Barnard explains how Dutch officials are looking
to protect their nation's interests and the jewel of the Netherlands'
transportation system, Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.
     Airports in the United States, meanwhile, tired of getting by on
government promises and little else are looking at creation of a National
Aviation Infrastructure Development Bank to fund their expansion plans. Ted
Gogoll explains.
     On the column front, Mark Lyons' Datalink examines America West's plans
to automate its cargo handling operations.
     Lisa Burgess in her Washington commentary asks and answers the question
of whether the time is ripe for a general overhaul in the way the world deals
with aviation rights.
     This month's Straight Talk column reviews the new "Business Consumer
Guide" report on the overnight delivery system. We also clear the smoke and
mirrors behind those lofty projections for third-party, contract logistics.
     Finally, this month we bring back an old friend in a new role. Charles
Thurston has been a regular contributor to The Journal of Commerce and
AirCommerce for a number of years. The author of "In From The Cold: How To Do
Business With Cuba" most recently was featured here in October as he examined
the efforts of Central and South American nations to invest and construct an
infrastructure straining under record cargo development. Today we raise the
curtain on Mr. Thurston and a new monthly feature column on the courier
industry.
     If you have specific questions or recommendations regarding the column,
Mr. Thurston can be reached through this office or direct at (212) 724-7060.

FIGHTING THE COLD WAR: A WINTER TO REMEMBER


 By Janet Plume, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Not too long ago, the "Storm of the Century" meant massive loss
of life and property in a natural disaster from which thousands of victims
spent months or years recovering. These kinds of catastrophes, including
Hurricane Camille, which killed over 300 people in the South in 1969, or the
roaring tornadoes of 1974 that killed some 350 people across the South and
Midwest, wiped entire towns off the map.
     The winter of '96 included a January blizzard that stretched a thick
blanket of snow and ice across 17 states from Kansas City to Boston. While
lacking the tragic human and property losses of those earlier storms, many
still heralded the blizzard as the "Storm of the Century." Its greatest
legacy, however, will be as the storm from which we finally learned to cope.
     Today, in the era of instant media alerts and high-tech communications
forums, business and homeowners have substantially more lead time to prepare
for the worst of weather.
     The impact of January's record snowstorm was successfully minimized by
responsive networks in government and business that allowed the corporate and
public world to sidestep much of the damage before it occurred.
Municipalities in the Northeast banned motor traffic from city streets. Hub
airports shuttered their hangars, but opened emergency stations for stranded
travelers. Airports and carriers implemented emergency plans on the drawing
boards for months and in some cases years.
     Despite reducing the loss of life and property exponentially, the impact
of January's record lows and devastating icy onslaught was still widespread.
Insurers expect to pay out some $585 million in claims, making the storm the
most expensive winter blast since 1965, according to the American Insurance
Services Group Inc.
     Air carriers alone expect to incur up to $120 million in delays and lost
business, according to the Air Transport Association.
     Air cargo handlers expect to confront weather-related calamities as part
of doing business. But the Blizzard of '96 affected such a large part of the
country that no air carrier could ignore it.
     "This was similar in severity to Hurricane Andrew, but with ice," said
ATA economist Dick Swieringa. "It stretched over a big part of the country
that has an enormous amount of air travel and lasted several days, paralyzing
an entire system."
     Airports shut down from Washington, D.C., to Boston, with Logan
International setting a new record for its longest down time since the winter
of 1978. Snow drifts in central Pennsylvania reached 7 feet. Nearly 3 feet of
snow was reported at Baltimore-Washington and Newark, N.J. international
airports as well as New York's LaGuardia Airport. A state of emergency was
declared in some areas as winds gusted up to 60 mph along the Atlantic Coast.
Subzero record lows were reported from Kansas to Vermont.
     Transportation along the East Coast ground to a standstill.
     Chicago's O'Hare Airport, which never actually shut down but had
hundreds of flights canceled, rolled out its stranded passenger program for
six days, offering cots, blankets, pillows, travel kits, coffee and
sandwiches to more than 1,200 travelers, most of whom were headed east and
could get no further than the Windy City.
     "They came this far and couldn't get where they were going, and then
many of them couldn't get back to where they had come from," said Lisa
Howard, Airport Public Relations Director. "We called it Camp O'Hare."
     It wasn't just passengers who were stranded. At one point, O'Hare had
209 aircraft, many with cargo, sitting overnight on the ground that were
scheduled to be elsewhere.
     In Philadelphia, airport managers began planning for the blizzard on
Jan. 5, two full days before the storm hit.
     "We had our maintenance and snow removal people in place," said Phyllis
Van Istendal, Philadelphia International Public Relations Manager. "When we
saw this coming, we made plans to deal with it."
     Mr. Swieringa said the costs incurred by airports will eventually be
passed onto the users in the form of higher landing fees.
     "This storm was a very disruptive type of thing," he said. "But it could
have been worse. One thing we're seeing now is that with higher and higher
levels of automation within companies, they can recover more quickly and get
their aircraft back into position, be back on schedule more quickly than when
they had guys with green eye shades."
     Delta Airlines canceled more than 1,800 flights during the deluge of
snow and ice, according to Jackie Pate, corporate communications manager.
International flights scheduled for John F. Kennedy Airport were rerouted to
Atlanta, Cincinnati and Orlando, Fla.
     "The reason that cargo didn't suffer to the extent that the stranded
passengers did is that a lot of customers couldn't get to the airport so it
wasn't a case where we had deliveries piling up," Ms. Pate said.
     As the worst of the blizzard swooped down Jan. 7 on the East Coast, the
impact on air cargo movement was reduced because Sunday and Monday are the
industry's two lightest days, said Ed Martelle, spokesman for American
Airlines' cargo division.
     United Parcel Service implemented its winter contingency plan, which
included rerouting some shipments to nearby gateway airports -- such as
changing flights scheduled for UPS' main East Coast package-sorting
Philadelphia hub to Louisville, Ky. -- and trucking freight to cities whose
airports were closed, according to Jennifer Giles, a UPS public relations
manager.
     Even by using ground deliveries, the storm's timing enabled UPS to
deliver most packages that it picked up Friday to the destination airports.
Operations managers at UPS headquarters in Atlanta did encounter difficulties
gathering status reports on deliveries in the snowbound areas.
     "That's because all able-bodied management people were out making
deliveries," UPS spokesman John Flick said.
     Dave Fonkalsrud, spokesman for DHL Worldwide Express, said the
Brussels-based carrier had to be creative to get its shipments to customers
in New York City. On Jan. 9, city officials in New York banned motor vehicles
from city streets. Because a large number of DHL's customers are financial
institutions awaiting letters of credit where an extra day in delivery can
amount to a significant loss of interest, 60 DHL couriers devised an
alternative means of delivering some 6,000 shipments.
     They took the subway.
     Emery Worldwide's North American Sortation Center in Dayton, Ohio,
considered the January blizzard the second winter calamity of the season.
     A Dec. 14 snowfall was followed by a warming trend that created steam
and thick fog that prevented Emery planes from landing in Dayton.
     Tim Strauss, hub operations director, recalls employees going home for
the night and returned at 4 p.m. the next day to join the day-sort team to
process all the freight.
     "But by the time the planes were ready and reloaded, they required major
de-icing, which caused further delays," said Mr. Strauss.
     To compensate for an additional lost day, employees returned early again
on the third consecutive day to run an extra operation.
     Stealing a look at the calender, Mr. Strauss ruefully noted,
"Unfortunately, we haven't seen the end of this."

LATIN AMERICA'S GROWING TRADE BRINGS FINANCING INNOVATIONS


 By Joe Harkins, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Trade growth within Latin America is helping to spur
innovations in trade financing methods.
     "As regional trade opportunities are expanding, long-standing vehicles
(of trade finance) are not always relevant to the changing needs of buyers,
sellers, and the institutions which facilitate trade. We're hoping newer
systems will satisfy them," said Tom Noonan, president of First Meridian Bank
in Coral Gables, Fla. "Most trade between Latin American countries is
triangular," said Jim McCollom, executive vice president in the Miami office
of Banco Santa Cruz, a Bolivian bank.
     "The goods may move between Brazil and Bolivia, for example, but the
transaction will be financed from Miami. Virtually all such trade has been
dollarized. The institutions handling that financing are increasingly based
in the U.S. because that's where the dollars are," added Mr. McCollom, who is
also first vice president of the Florida International Bankers Association.
     That doesn't mean the financing is necessarily being handled by domestic
institutions.
     In the past, most Latin trade was financed through Edge Act banks, named
after a 1919 federal law that allows foreign and domestic banks to
participate in international trade finance. The debt crisis in the 1980s,
together with consolidations and mergers, caused many to withdraw from the
scene.
     However, some Edge Act banks are still around. Banco Santander
International and Standard Chartered Bank, for example, play a major role in
financing trade within the hemisphere. In explaining their continued
activity, one Edge Act Bank official, while declining to be named, claimed
they offer financing at rates less than half that of Latin American "agent
banks" operating from the United States under similar but different banking
laws.
     Mr. McCollom disputed that assertion. "Although Edge Act banks are more
likely to be dealing directly with both the importer and exporter, rates are
market driven. While there may be some unique individual situation, and I'm
not aware of any, the claimed differential does not exist."
     While most U.S.-based agency banks active in Latin America have their
roots there, some significant agents don't. Two of the largest, Barclay's
Bank and Deutsche-SudAmerikanishe Bank, are European.
     Mr. McCollom said agency bank volume is growing. "The numbers say
roughly $6 billion was in the system during 1995, but these were almost
entirely 90-to-180-day transactions, meaning the money turned over more than
once. I'd say that figure actually represents about $15 billion to $18
billion in trades."
     Meanwhile, paperless trading is also gaining ground.
     "Import-export finance is about to move off the printed page and onto
your desktop PC. This will eliminate most of the written documentation
currently required, and will end the delays, expenses, difficulties in
resolving inter-document discrepancies, the back and forth in making changes,
and the errors those complexities generate," said Guy Tozzoli, president of
the World Trade Centers Association Inc.
     The New York-based association plans to begin a three-month test of its
new Full Service Trade System in the United States, Taiwan and France in
July. Mr. Tozzoli estimated that it will take one and a half to two years
before the system is expanded to a worldwide basis.
     WTCA's 303 members, located in 89 countries, will supply traders with
software, security codes, pre-approved credit based on local rules, and
training in the system.
     "The funders could be banks, insurance companies or any other kind of
financial institution," Mr. Tozzoli said.
     Other concepts are winning attention, too. Tony Brown, senior vice
president and division head at MTB Bank's Trading Alliance Division in New
York, said new traders and small ones often find it hard to obtain financing
because banks wants to see assets and a strong balance sheet.
     "They turn away those who lack them. That's where we come in. We do
transaction-based financing."
     MTB will control the transaction all the way to the final buyer, Mr.
Brown said. "It's important for us to know all the parties involved. We are
rigorous in our examination of quality of the goods, knowledgeable in the
realities of the market for those goods, and attentive to other facts
normally of no interest to asset-based financiers."
     MTB will often buttress transactions with the participation of a
domestic correspondent bank, plus insurance against the consequences of
political interruptions and economic disturbances, he said, adding that this
may cost more than traditional financing.
     Transactions involving major capital purchases are also encouraging new
strategies. "Let's say a Canadian or U.S. firm is about to supply a power
plant or telecommunication system to a Latin American country," said David
Harris, president of New York-based Harris Corp. "Unlike consumable goods
finance, the time frame is five or 10 years. Historically, portions of this
deal might have involved the issuance of project-specific bonds which major
institutions would have bought, either for their own portfolio, or resale.
The prime potential source for such funds nowadays is the institutional
investor market, but so far an infrastructure is lacking."
     Mr. Harris suggested that the U.S. mortgage securities market could
provide a model for securitizing capital projects. "We're very interested in
encouraging such a structure for hemisphere transaction capital, and we think
the region offers the best opportunity to apply it."

AMERICA WEST SEEKS NEW CARGO SYSTEM ON THE AUTOMATION TRAIL


 AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--America West Airlines is once again the sweetheart of the
rodeo. Now she's lookin' for a cowpoke to take her to the hoedown.
     After several grueling years, the Phoenix-based airline surpassed its
revenue goal in 1995 by $25 million. This month, its stock has traded in the
neighborhood of $17 per share and close to its 52-week high of $19 and well
above the low of $7.675 a share. But hiding in the midst of this revelry was
a disturbing statistic: Following years of expansion, 1995's cargo revenue
growth was flat.
     Even before the year-end result was known, America West had begun
searching for ways to boost cargo revenue, says Tawn Downs, the airline's
cargo planning manager and acting director of cargo sales and services. Ms.
Downs would like to see double-digit cargo growth for 1996. This year, her
department will use a lot of its energy to boost its cargo sales and
marketing skills. To help this effort along, Ms. Downs wants to enhance
America West's cargo automation.
     "We were close to selecting a vendor for a new cargo system," Ms. Downs
says. "Then we decided to step back and re-evaluate our needs."
     In 1995, air cargo represented 3 percent of America West's revenue. Half
the cargo income was from U.S. mail. About 40 percent was general bulk
freight and the rest was airport-to-airport packages. All of the 65,000 tons
of freight flown was tendered loose. The pieces were individually loaded into
the airline's fleet of narrow-bodied jets and transported through its U.S.
route network.
     Automating the cargo activity for a passenger airline is a complicated
undertaking. Software engineers say it is more difficult than automating the
passenger system. And unlike the international air cargo business, where
space is usually booked in advance, most domestic freight arrives at the
loading dock without warning. The freight is loose, so the computer must keep
track of many shipments at one time.
     Also, the limited freight capacity of narrow-bodied passenger planes
tends to produce split shipments, which are harder to track. For example,
when a forwarder tenders a shipment of 150 boxes, it may be split into two or
more partial shipments that each travel on a different aircraft with a
different route to the final destination.
     Freight capacity is constantly changing. A load may be balanced between
passengers, baggage, mail and freight. Then, a last minute flight
cancellation will add dozens of new passengers and bags and the whole
equation has to be recalculated very quickly.
     Even though advanced bookings are not the rule in domestic traffic, the
system must still be able to reserve space for freight with guaranteed
delivery times and for special commodities like human remains that require
advance booking by law.
     Just to make things more complicated, America West is exploring new
freight products and handling methods that will effect its automation needs.
     Ms. Downs says the airline is studying the market for counter-to-counter
packages that weigh less than 100 pounds. This category of freight is growing
and produces higher yields than heavy freight. Since many of these shipments
are dropped off at the counter, ticket agents will need access to the cargo
reservations system and additional training in how to use it.
     So far, Ms. Downs has not been able to find a cargo system that suits
the airline's needs. "It has to be easy to use and easy to learn," she says.
"We cannot afford 40 to 80 hours to train a cargo agent. We must keep costs
down. On the other hand, if the system is not easy to use, agents won't use
it. That's a proven fact."
     Among other things, the ideal cargo system for America West must receive
information from the passenger reservation system in order to advise cargo
handlers of last-minute gate changes. It must communicate with the new weight
and balance system in order to facilitate flight planning. It must provide
strong general ledger and accounting services.
     It must report on utilization patterns by aircraft, by flight number, by
type of cargo. "If we don't know how we utilize aircraft in a particular
market, we can't maximize revenue," Ms. Downs says.
     Today, America West tracks cargo through an archaic system that resides
in its passenger reservations computer, Ms. Downs explains. It lacks
information on capacity and utilization. "It is not suitable for the way we
want to do business in 1996 and beyond."
     Ms. Downs is looking for a cargo system and has reviewed a number of
them. They either did not offer the right combination of features, could not
operate on America West's brand of computers, or could not justify their high
cost, she says.
     "People were saying a new system would reduce our freight claims by 60
percent," Ms. Downs reports. "That was supposed to save us big bucks. Well,
our claims are less than 1 percent, so I don't think so."
     Automation can also reduce the time agents spend on the telephone with
customers and the need to rekey shipment information at various stations.
"But I still don't see millions of dollars saved here," Ms. Downs says.
     "We ought to be able to buy software for a system like this for under $1
million," Ms. Downs says. "But I haven't found one product that does it all.
And all the other people I talk to in this business say they can't find one
either."
     Anybody want to sashay over to the hoedown?

FEDEX WEATHERED 'STORM OF THE CENTURY' FROM MEMPHIS, TENN., WAR ROOM


 By Janet Plume, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Successful gamblers say the key to winning is preparation,
understanding the game, lowering the odds and leaving as little as possible
to chance.
     In the case of this winter's "Storm of the Century," some people might
think the nation's leading air freight carrier had luck on its side. Ken May,
Federal Express Global Operations Control and Coordination Manager, will tell
you his company was merely prepared.
     The 17 states from Kansas to the East Coast that were paralyzed by
record snowfall and subzero temperatures included FedEx's most heavily
trafficked routes. The blizzard hit three of its four U.S. hubs at
Indianapolis, Memphis, Tenn. and Newark, N.J. and affected 25 percent to 30
percent of its business worldwide.
     As the winter storm began its eastward march across the Great Plains,
Mr. May put a winter contingency plan, two years in the making, into effect.
     "We set up a war room in the control center in Memphis," Mr. May said.
"Any time from now on when we have a natural disaster, we will mobilize in
this war room with 25-30 people who represent different operating groups in
the company."
     The war room crowd talked through the situation and decided how to
handle it. Specialized software provided down-the-line effects of potential
scenarios.
     "We sat down and talked about what was facing us," Mr. May said. "We
started by shutting down the Indianapolis hub on Jan. 2, where they were
about to get 10 inches of snow."
     FedEx rerouted all 40 Indianapolis flights to Memphis, where employees
ran a second sorting operation after handling packages for the 120 flights
that normally arrive in Memphis every night. Packages were delivered on time
the next morning without a hitch. It was the first time FedEx had shut down a
major hub facility and moved the entire operation to another facility.
     "This blizzard was one reason that we decentralized several years ago,"
Mr. May said. "We realized what could happen to us if we lost our single
major hub during one of these catastrophes."
     By the time the blizzard reached FedEx's third hub in Newark, N.J., the
weekend had arrived.
     "The majority of our packages for Saturday delivery are handled in
Memphis," Mr. May said. "The packages Newark receives on Saturday are for
Monday delivery."
     But the New Jersey hub still faced an uphill battle. "They had time on
their side with the weekend," Mr. May said. "But manpower was the problem;
people had a hard time getting to work." Realizing the work force in Newark
was sorely short-handed, courier packs normally handled in Newark were
re-routed to Memphis for sorting. Newark employees were left to sort boxes.
     "I feel like we handled that storm flawlessly," Mr. May said. "We kept
our service levels high while we managed through it."
     Three weeks later, on Groundhog Day, when another icy blast howled into
Memphis, FedEx maintained normal operations while other airlines cancelled
flights.
     "We brought 120 airplanes in here and out that day with an average
departure delay of little more than an hour," said Mr. May.
     "We started planning for this type of situation last summer," he said.
"We spent a lot of hours drilling and training people how to keep runways
open in these conditions. We think it's paid off." FedEx has placed a $20
million price tag on business lost during the icy blizzard that buried the
Northeast this winter. The final cost of the blizzard of '96 will be higher
after FedEx adds in the extra expense it incurred coping with the storm. But
the innovative Memphis air freight carrier could have been hurt a lot worse
without its war plan, Mr. May said.

STREAMLINING CUSTOMS IS HEMISPHERIC GOAL


 By Maria Carlino, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--The dizzying list of customs procedures and requirements
throughout the Americas has been a nightmare for exporters and importers.
     With the recent proliferation of regional trade pacts, customs officials
from Canada to Chile have joined forces to begin simplifying the maze.
Governments are working together to streamline paperwork and cut back on red
tape, expedite cargo clearance at border crossings, harmonize rules of origin
and rid agencies of fraud and corruption.
     For example, Canada, Mexico and the United States are poised to
introduce a prototype for standardized electronic documentation to clear
goods through customs at their borders. The Information Exchange and
Automation Working Group, a trilateral panel created under the 1994 North
American Free Trade Agreement, is spearheading the project.
     "The problem with our borders is not that free trade doesn't work. It's
the fact that we don't get information on these transactions until the
shipment arrives," said Robert Ehinger, director of international trade data
exchange for U.S. Customs.
     Under the program, the three countries would standardize trade data
gathered by customs officials to the point where cargo documentation arrives
at the border crossing before the truck or train does. This way, customs
officials would have enough information to decide whether to stop the
shipment for inspection or let it move through immediately.
     The procedure will apply to automotive parts, beer and liquor,
electronics, fresh fruits and vegetables, lumber, newsprint, steel, textiles
and apparel at two U.S.-Canada crossings and four Mexico-U.S. crossings. The
prototype was originally scheduled to be used in the field for a minimum of
six months beginning in January, but will probably not be launched until the
fall, Mr. Ehinger said.
     He attributed the delay in part to the U.S. government shutdowns in
recent months, adding that the schedule depends on getting the proper
technology in place along the borders.
     Officials are also working to develop a hemisphere-wide customs
procedures guide, one of the mandates trade ministers from 34 nations set
last June during a summit meeting in Denver to prepare countries for a
free-trade zone spanning North, Central and South America. The ministers will
meet again in March to work toward making hemispheric integration a reality
by 2005.
     In early February, the Working Group on Customs Procedures and Rules of
Origin, one of seven technical groups established during the summit, met in
La Paz, Bolivia, to start work on the guide. Group members also began
discussing ways to simplify customs procedures, identify areas for technical
cooperation in customs operations such as computerized networks and fraud
prevention as well as to develop a transparent system of rules of origin.
Origin rules, which determine where a product is made or what percentage of a
product is made in a specific country, are pertinent because countries use
them to determine the product's tariff treatment.
     A U.S. customs official who was present at the meeting stressed the
importance of "understanding that we're developing things the same way and
that we're talking about the same things."
     Several South American countries are following the same approach. "With
regard to customs, Mercosur is working hard to coordinate policies and
bureaucratic standards," said Eva Holz, a commercial law professor at the
State University of Uruguay Law School.
     Ms. Holz referred to efforts among Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, the four members of the Southern Cone Common Market customs union
known as Mercosur, to harmonize complicated tariffs and customs regimes. For
example, "in the past, importers and exporters had to go through customs
paperwork with several different state agencies. The countries have agreed to
streamline this whereby you only have to go through customs," she said.
     In addition, Brazil, which has both federal and state regulations, has
made headway in simplifying requirements.
     Ms. Holz stressed that continued economic reform, especially in Brazil
and Argentina, Mercosur's two largest economies, would be key to pushing the
customs standardization process forward.
     Felipe Garcia, an adviser with the National Law Center for
Inter-American Free Trade in Tucson, Ariz., agreed, saying that more
open-door economic policies as well as the advent of high-tech customs
systems would facilitate the development of unified codes and practices.
"Because of technology and other factors this area of trade policy will be
easier to harmonize and change than others," Mr. Garcia said.

AS EXPRESS MARKET EXPANDS...AIR COURIERS PROLIFERATE


 AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Air courier companies are proliferating, and the permutations
of company-to-company cooperation schemes have reached a dizzying frenzy of
activity, especially now that the international express market is rising
above the one million shipments-per-day mark for the first time.
     With hundreds of players in the global market, the task of keeping up
with the scope of events, issues and trends in the express air courier
industry could keep even a prolific carrier pigeon tied to his typewriter 24
hours a day.
     This column, nonetheless, will make a noble, monthly attempt to visit
topics of interest to international couriers, to take note of those who
support their businesses, and to illuminate those who stand in their way. The
number of companies involved in this industry is large and getting larger --
the Air Courier Conference of America, in Washington, counts over 110
corporate members alone. And counterpart organizations elsewhere in the world
are expanding rapidly, too.
     As has often been the case with globalization, the expansion rate of the
courier market outside the United States is distinctly faster than within.
According to Air Cargo Management Group, of Seattle, the international market
for air courier express shipments is growing at a rate of 25 percent a year,
compared with a mere 15 percent domestic U.S. growth rate.
     Lee Hibbets, research director for the consultants' group, says
international shipments constitute about a fifth of the volume of daily U.S.
shipments, just nosing past the 5.5 million mark.
     But it will not take long for international shipments to exceed the U.S.
level. Carriers are moving into new regions, new countries and new airports
as fast as they can stencil a new "Open For Business" sign.
     In Latin America, a hot market for air couriers, a regional organization
working to remove trade barriers is the Conferencia Latino Americana de
Companias Express, or Cladec, which is registered in Panama. Among other
targets, the group is focusing on customs agencies to get them to modernize
clearing technology, encouraging national governments to lift surcharges, and
pressing congressmen to rewrite laws to facilitate air courier shipments.
"We've successfully worked with customs in several of the (South American)
southern cone countries," confirmed Susan Lyon, a spokeswoman for the Latin
American business of DHL WorldWide Express, a member of Cladec.
     Indeed, DHL has had such positive results over the last few months with
a pilot program in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama and Peru, that the
carrier plans in April to expand the billing decentralization program to a
total of 38 countries around the globe, she said. The new system permits a
factory manager in Peru, for example, to order parts or supplies from a U.S.
manufacturer and pay for the shipment through a local account, rather than
using the U.S. shipper's account, she explained.
     Cladec, in turn, is encouraging the formation of country associations
for air couriers throughout Latin America, to help galvanize change on a
local level. Thus far, 15 country associations have been formed in Latin
America, according to Larry Burtchaell, the executive director of Cladec.
"We're just getting started in the Caribbean now," noted Mr. Burtchaell, on
his way to Lima for a group meeting with a number of Peruvian officials.
     Since no single air courier can hope to have enough aircraft or
employees to serve every airport in the world, strategic cooperation is the
bylaw of this industry, in contrast with others. While DHL carries out a
recently announced $30 million upgrade of its hub in Panama, the company has
forged agreements with American Airlines and other carriers to handle its
express shipments in the southern cone of South America. "There must be 20
different (cooperative) combinations that companies use to get the materials
where they go," said Ms. Lyon.
     That's 20 permutations of the global combinations of several hundred
players in the market, each of which forms extended geographic networks that
are constantly shifting as the market expands and matures. Schedules and
pricing, of course, are easier to track.

DELIVERY OF PERISHABLES: IT'S ALL IN THE TIMING, TRANSPORT


 By Russ Banham, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--The next time you munch on a peach and marvel at its freshness,
give thanks not just to Mother Nature. Modern technological advancements in
cooling and transporting perishables are keeping produce fresher longer.
     When it comes to perishable produce, two things are paramount: the
integrity of the cooling process and the rapid movement of freight. Three new
technological developments offer great promise in these areas: vacuum
cooling, improved temperature recording and satellite-driven tracking and
tracing of cargo.
     Vacuum cooling involves the extremely rapid evaporation of water from
fruits and vegetables. Even when produce is cooled, humidity can cause
degradation. Used for decades to cool iceberg lettuce, which is extremely
susceptible to cold water damage, vacuum cooling systems have only recently
been modified to cool other types of produce.
     In January, Lufthansa purchased a vacuum cooling system from Packaged
Refrigeration Systems Inc., a Jacksonville, Fla.-based manufacturer of
industrial refrigeration systems for its new perishable-cargo terminal at
Miami International Airport.
     "Vacuum cooling provides a better means by which perishables can be
preserved for transportation," said Mel Torre, a Lufthansa spokesman in New
York.
     "The problem with air cooling is that it's inefficient," said Stan
Badenhop, director of produce cooling equipment at Packaged Refrigeration
Systems. "You can't get the cool air to be in contact with the entire produce
pallet. If you have several boxes of fruit, for example, stacked on a pallet,
it's impossible to cool the central boxes, which are blocked by the adjacent
cartons."
     With vacuum cooling, produce is put on a conveyor and moved into a steel
vacuum chamber with doors at either end. The pallets are rolled in, the doors
close, the vacuum pumps turn on and the air is evacuated. The product is then
cooled to its optimum level. The process takes 45 minutes to an hour.
     Moving perishable commodities requires that they remain within a few
degrees of this optimum level of coolness. A new temperature monitoring
system developed by Ryan Instruments in Redmond, Wash., not only helps motor
carriers maintain the appropriate levels, but also provides a computerized
history of the freight's temperature.
     "Our new devices offer continuous monitoring of perishables throughout
the cold chain," said Dan Vache, a Ryan vice president. "At any time during
the cold cycle, you can download information telling you the temperature of
the freight at any given time."
     If a shipper sets the temperature gauge at 38 degrees for a particular
perishable product, and the temperature either drops below or rises above
that level, a red indicator light flashes. Downloading of the monitor's data
will indicate precisely when the temperature changed. The new monitoring
system is particularly effective in resolving disputes over degraded produce.
     "Let's say you have a restaurant in Los Angeles that wants its produce
delivered early in the morning and left out on the back dock," he said. "The
shipper gets the freight there on time, but the restaurant's workers show up
late to move it off the dock. The produce degrades in the heat, and
accusations fly."
     With Ryan's new monitoring device, a computer read-out of the
temperature data will reveal exactly when the freight dipped below the target
cooling level.
     Satellite communications is another new technology helping to meet the
just-in-time inventory requirements of fresh produce sellers and buyers.
     "If a receiver of produce has to have a load diverted, we can re-route
our trucks within minutes," said Jack Liles, president of the rail services
division at KLLM Transport Services Inc. KLLM, a Jackson, Miss.-based
refrigerated motor carrier, mounts satellites on the roofs of its trucks to
provide two-way communications. Each truck driver is equipped further with a
computer and modem, allowing the transfer of a wide range of data.
     The new system has been a boon to produce buyers, Mr. Liles said. He
recalled one shipper who decided that the temperatures set for a shipment of
tomatoes were too low. "The shipper called us and wondered if the
temperatures could be hiked up a bit," he said. "We contacted the driver, had
the temperatures changed, and called back the customer five minutes later."

U.S. AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS FLAT DESPITE NAFTA HOPES


 By Janet Plume, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--U.S. produce exports were essentially flat last year despite
expectations that the North American Free Trade Agreement would bring a spurt
in growth.
     As U.S. growers expanded into the global arena, exports of fresh
vegetables inched up 3 percent to nearly 1.8 million tons in the fiscal year
that ended last Sept. 30, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
figures.
     Fresh fruit shipments, however, dipped about 1 percent to just under 2.7
million metric tons. Shipments to Mexico plunged 41 percent to 159,167 tons,
due to the peso crisis and economic turmoil there, while exports to Canada,
by far the largest market, fell 5 percent to 824,808 tons.
     Exports to Mexico have also been hit by a trade dispute stemming from a
U.S. ban on Mexican avocado imports.
     Growth in new Asian and Latin American markets, however, nearly offset
the drop in shipments directly north and south of the U.S. border. Tomatoes,
cherries, apples and other fruits have become hot commodities among an
increasingly Westernized population in the Pacific Rim and in Latin America.
     The virtual explosion of new trade opportunities has made consumer foods
the largest and fastest growing segment of global agricultural trade. The
market is now estimated at close to $200 billion worldwide.
     Lettuce, potatoes and onions led the list of fresh vegetable exports in
1995. More than two-thirds of all exported vegetables were shipped to Canada
last year. The United States' northern neighbor, whose colder clime and short
growing season limit fruit production, has slowed its imports from the United
States in the past three years.
     In 1993 when U.S. fresh vegetable exports reached a record, 40 percent
of those sales went to Canada and Mexico. U.S. exports to its two closest
neighbors had skyrocketed 1,000 percent since 1988.
     Fresh fruit and vegetable exports to some parts of Latin America
declined last year due in part to phytosanitary concerns. In November,
Ecuador shut its borders completely to U.S. fresh fruit and vegetable
imports, holding up shipments for two weeks until representatives of the
USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service convinced authorities that the
crop-damaging Oriental fruit fly was discovered outside California's growing
regions and would not appear in imports.
     Sheena Kuruvilla, international trade manager for the United Fruit and
Vegetable Association, said Mexican agricultural leaders are using U.S.
exports as a political handball.
     "Mexico has said that if the United States refuses to remove barriers
against Mexican avocados, they will impose barriers against U.S. exports such
as apples," she said.
     Mexico has petitioned the USDA to permit avocado imports, which have
long been banned for sale in the United States because of inadequate Mexican
pest controls. Mexican growers argue they have substantially improved their
pest control methods and the U.S. ban amounts to a non-tariff trade barrier.
Florida and California avocado growers have campaigned against dropping the
ban. Mexican leaders have threatened to retaliate with bans on various U.S.
products.
     Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has indicated he would drop the ban
if the pesticide issue has been addressed.
     "Countries will use bad science to keep us out, but the rules have to
work both ways," Mr. Glickman recently told a public policy conference
sponsored by the Alexandria, Va.-based fruit and vegetable association, which
begins its annual conference today in New Orleans.
     Last month, Colombia, which buys the bulk of its apples and pears from
the Pacific Northwest, threatened to impose a fumigation requirement on all
U.S. fresh fruit and produce shipments.
     Colombia is the No. 3 market for Washington State apples, behind Brazil
and Mexico, buying some 444,000, 42-pound cartons last year. The region also
sent more than 60,000 cartons of pears to the Colombia.
     Colombian officials insist the Oriental fruit fly doesn't exist in their
country, and could be introduced in U.S. shipments. Argentina, Brazil and
Ecuador have passed similar measures.
     Colombian officials later suspended the fumigation order after U.S.
growers protested the practice. But they still require a special certificate
stating the fruit originated in a state where the Oriental fruit fly has not
been detected.
     U.S. growers are not eager to begin fumigating because the process is
costly and can damage the produce being treated.
     Ed Brooks, Latin American marketing director for the Washington Apple
Commission, said the Colombian fumigation requirement could have had a major
impact on sales.
     "Our fruit was more expensive this past season because of the smaller
crop," Mr. Brooks said. "It's difficult to stay competitive with other apple
producers such as Chile."
     Last fall's apple harvest in Washington State, which exports about
one-third of its apples, reaped 80 million boxes, down from 92 million boxes
in 1994. While the state produces about half the national harvest, it
accounts for 90 percent of all U.S. apple exports.
     Washington State's apple exports to Mexico shrank about 50 percent last
season to 4 million boxes. James Thomas, spokesman for the Washington Apple
Commission, said the devaluation of the peso and continuing economic turmoil
contributed to the decline.
     Asia is expected to become a major consumer of fresh foods over the next
five years as portions of the Uruguay Round are enacted, including subsidy
and tariff reductions.
     But California exporters are worried that customers such as Japan and
South Korea could cancel the $26 million in U.S. fresh fruit and vegetables
they buy each year if California growers lose an irreplaceable crop fumigant.
The sale of methyl bromide is scheduled to be banned in California March 30
along with some 200 other chemicals under a state birth defects prevention
law.
     Both Japan and Korea require pre-export fumigation with methyl bromide
on certain stone fruits and cherries. Considered to be damaging to the ozone
layer, methyl bromide is scheduled to be phased out of use in the United
States by 2001.
     Another hot market for U.S. fruit and vegetable growers is China, which
opened its market to U.S. apples in 1994. However, imported apples incur a 40
percent tariff duty plus a 16 percent value-added that tax keeps costs high
and volume low.
     Hong Kong is an important market for grapes and oranges, while Taiwan is
the largest importer of U.S. apples.
     The first shipment of Florida grapefruit since trade barriers came down
made its way to Thailand last year. U.S. exporters pay a 57 percent tariff,
which is reduced 3 percent each year. But 1996 exports of any of Florida's
produce are likely to become more expensive this year in the wake of a deadly
freeze that gripped the nation earlier this month. The rise in prices caused
by the shortages is likely to result in lower export volume, agriculture
officials said.

TRADE BATTLES CLOUD AGRICULTURAL IMPORT FORECAST DESPITE RISING DEMAND


 By Janet Plume, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     NEW ORLEANS--Feb. 26--As the first baby boomers turn 50 this year, the
sex, drugs and rock 'n roll generation is turning to healthier living habits,
which is good news for fresh fruit and vegetable importers.
     Americans ate a record 100 pounds of fresh fruit per capita in 1994,
according to the Department of Agriculture. While final figures for 1995
haven't been released, that number is expected to be up about 15 percent.
     Fresh fruit imports were expected to approach 1.9 million tons last
year, up more than 16 percent from 1994. Fresh vegetable imports were
estimated to top 2.5 million tons at year's end, up some 14 percent from
1994's tally of nearly 2.2 million tons.
     Bananas lead the U.S. fresh fruit import crop, with more than twice as
many tons shipped into the United States as the combined total for all other
imported fruits. Melons, mostly from Mexico, and grapes, mostly from Chile,
rank second and third.
     Tomatoes, almost all from Mexico, rank as the top vegetable import,
followed by potatoes, which come exclusively from Canada and cucumbers, for
which Mexico is the only source.
     With consumer demand rising, the outlook for fresh fruit and vegetable
imports would appear to be rosy, boosting free-trade efforts on the road to
hemispheric integration. But U.S. farmers increasingly view the North
American Free Trade Agreement as a raw deal. Phytosanitary standards have
become major stumbling blocks among the 34 countries attempting to reach a
Free Trade Agreement of the Americas by 2005.
     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has been traveling the globe in
the past six months pressing countries to drop unscientifically founded,
anti-pest barriers to U.S. farm products. His leverage for making such
demands rests in part on proof that the United States itself is willing to
take the politically painful step of eradicating its own non-tariff barriers
to farm product imports.
     U.S. farmers, though, are loudly protesting surges in imports from
Mexico and Canada, arguing the increased supply drives down prices below cost
levels. Shortly before Christmas last year, Florida growers dumped hundreds
of pounds of beans, eggplant and squash into a parking lot to call attention
to the more than 50 percent increase in Mexican shipments of cucumbers,
eggplants, peppers, squash and tomatoes. Earlier this month, Florida
Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford issued an order halting every truck in
the state carrying foreign produce and subjecting it to new health and safety
inspections.
     Free-trade proponents say the real problem with Mexican imports lies
with the collapse of the peso, making Mexican fruits and vegetables much
cheaper to sell in the U.S. market.
     The administration's push to lift an 81-year-old ban on Mexican avocados
is one such example.
     Last year, Mexico petitioned the USDA to lift the ban on its Haas
avocado, which was imposed because of Mexico's poor pest controls. Mexican
growers claimed they had gone to great lengths to eradicate pests and that
the U.S. ban amounted to a non-tariff trade barrier.
     Last July, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
proposed lifting the import ban, saying a study had concluded Mexican
avocados would not bring pests into California, where 90 percent of U.S.
avocados are grown.
     Florida and California avocado growers campaigned fiercely to keep the
ban. USDA received some 2,000 letters from growers protesting a change in the
ban.
     Rules set down under the Uruguay Round world trade agreement specify
that countries can't bar imports of agricultural products without a sound
scientific reason. Avocado growers claim imports would pose a high risk to
the U.S. crop, cited a University of California study last fall that
challenged Aphis' conclusions.
     The newer study concluded that certain species of fruit fly would
probably become established in California in three to 50 years after imports
began. Aphis had said the fruit fly wouldn't be established for 1 million
years.
     Advocates of lifting the ban argue the risk to the growers is economic
rather than a threat to the health of their crops. Mexican imports have
driven down prices of tomatoes, grapes and brussels sprouts this winter.
     Earlier this month, the Agriculture Department began moving forward with
plans to lift the ban and allow Mexican avocados to be imported into 19
northeastern states. Mark Affleck, president of the California Avocado
Commission, said he had confirmed the USDA was reviewing a final rule to be
issued by the office of general counsel.
     Mr. Affleck said his group would oppose the rule in federal court.
     Similar trade disputes between the United States and other countries
could be affected by the avocado controversy. Exporters of stone fruits in
California and the Pacific Northwest say their products are prohibited from
entering Mexico because of the U.S. ban on avocados.
     In Florida, tomato growers have vociferously opposed the increased level
of Mexican tomatoes entering the United States, which they insist amounts to
dumping. U.S. imports of Mexican tomatoes shot up 40 percent during the
12-month period between Oct. 1, 1994 and Sept. 30, 1995 to 534,345 tons,
which represented 96 percent of all U.S. tomato imports during that period.
     NAFTA allows Mexico to ship a certain amount of tomatoes to the United
States at reduced tariff rates. Once the quota level is exceeded, the normal
import tariff kicks in, adding about one-half cent a pound to the cost of
imported tomatoes. But the slow pace in measuring those imports in early 1995
produced a months-long delay in finding that Mexico had exceeded its quota.
The delay lasted long enough for the tomatoes to reach U.S. supermarkets.
     U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor proposed rectifying the
situation by measuring imports on a weekly basis rather than semi-annually
during each growing season, as is the current practice.
     Customs officials have warned they lack the resources to monitor tomato
shipments and alter tariff rates every week, and have speculated such a rule
could result in mountains of tomatoes rotting on U.S. borders.
     Mexican growers argue the natural peaks of the tomato season during
January and February and the unreliability of weather conditions cannot be
regulated to keep tomato shipments uniform throughout the season.
     Florida growers, who believe they have not received promised protection
from Mexican imports, argue the weekly quota would allow them to deal with
surges in imports that cause disruptions in their ability to set prices that
cover costs. Only a tiny portion of the Florida winter vegetable crop is
exported, so NAFTA -- which has received much stronger support from growers
dependent on exports -- has simply produced more competition for them.
     Mexican officials, who have denounced the bill as a protectionist bias
that violates NAFTA, have threatened retaliation against U.S. exports of
meat, grain and dairy products if Congress approves a bill backed by the
Florida Fruit & Vegetable Association. The bill would redefine who can
qualify for import protection under U.S. trade law and make producers of
"seasonal" perishable commodities eligible for relief.
     In California, U.S. table grape growers are considering levying charges
that Mexican producers have dumped their product on the American market.
Imported fruits and vegetables are normally sold for a price that is
predetermined by the importer and the wholesaler before the shipment arrives.
     Sometimes fruit is sold on consignment, when the shipper tells the buyer
to get whatever price he can. Domestic farmers contend consignment imports,
which skyrocketed last summer in California during grape growers' peak
season, destabilize the market by driving down prices. They also claim it can
provide growers a vehicle to divert large quantities of a certain product to
a specific market, which would constitute dumping.
     Growers contend Mexican bankers urged Mexican grape growers to dump
their produce on the U.S. market in 1995 after the peso's collapse. Imports
of Mexican grapes nearly doubled last year, rising from some 41,085 metric
tons during fiscal 1994 to 80,501 metric tons during fiscal 1995.
     California growers harvest nearly two-thirds of the nearly 2 billion
pounds of red, green and black table grapes consumed annually in the United
States. The bulk of the remainder is imported from Chile and Mexico.
     While much of the concern over U.S. imports stemmed from domestic
growers in the past year, an 11th-hour, 1995 decision by the California
Supreme Court scored a major victory for free trade.
     The state high court struck down an inspection fee collected since 1992
by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. The Pacific Merchant
Shipping Association estimates the department will have to return nearly $3
million to shippers who paid the fees during the past three years on foreign
agricultural products. It's not immediately known whether the decision will
also affect similar fees that have been collected from airlines, who paid out
about four times as much as ocean carriers. A handful of domestic airlines
have filed lawsuits protesting collection of the inspection fees.
     Shippers had argued the fee was discriminatory because domestic shippers
didn't pay a similar fee when agricultural goods were trucked across state
lines.

INSURERS SOURED ON 1995 CHERRY CROP


 By Russ Banham, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Don Reynolds was pretty lucky last year despite losing more
than 60 percent of his cherry crop to bad weather. Unlike other cherry
growers in Lodi, Calif., his company, M&R Packing, was insured.
     Indeed, 1995 was the pits for California's sweet cherry industry. Heavy
rains throughout April and May decimated the fragile fruit. Growers ended up
shipping barely 500,000 18-pound packages of fresh cherries, down from about
3.8 million packages in 1994. "It was a disaster," said Mr. Reynolds,
co-owner and vice president of M&R, which farms cherries on about 400 acres.
     Serendipity, however, had knocked at his door only a few months earlier.
American Agrisurance Inc., a Fresno, Calif.-based insurer, decided it would
take the plunge and provide loss and damage insurance to the state's cherry
growers.
     "Thanks to American Agrisurance, we were able to collect about $2,500 an
acre for our losses," Mr. Reynolds said. "That money was a godsend."
     For American Agrisurance, however, the tremendous losses were a hellish
reminder of how risky the cherry insurance business can be. After just one
year of insuring cherries, the company has pulled up stakes, convinced the
fruit is uninsurable. "Right now we don't want anything to do with cherries,"
said Chuck Luna, American Agrisurance field representative.
     Mr. Luna explained that high cherry losses are only part of its decision
to call it quits. "The biggest problem is the reinsurance market, which won't
touch cherries for beans," he said. Reinsurance is bought by insurance
companies to help spread their risks.
     That creates a dilemma for farmers like Mr. Reynolds and others in
California. American Agrisurance was the only private insurance carrier in
the state willing to consider cherry coverage. "We had one insurer in here in
about 1992 or 1993, but then they lost their shirts and never returned," Mr.
Reynolds recalled.
     The U.S. Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency, which provides
insurance on almost every fruit and vegetable farmed today, won't touch
cherries either. "We had a program years ago, but we terminated it. Right now
there's no insurance for cherry growers," said William Murphy, regional
service director in the risk management division of the agency, which
replaced the Federal Crop Insurance Corp.
     While the government's Non-insured Agricultural Program (NAP) offers
post-disaster financial assistance to cherry growers, the criteria for
receiving funds is very stringent. NAP funds, which are limited anyway, only
kick in after 35 percent of growers in a county suffer a 50 percent loss of
their average yield.
     The lack of any kind of risk transfer mechanism for cherry growers is
nothing new, according to Jim Culbertson, manager of the California Cherry
Advisory Board, a quasi state-industry organization promoting the cherry
industry. "It's been a problem on and off for years," Mr. Culbertson said.
"Now and then, a courageous insurer like American Agrisurance will buck the
odds and offer insurance. But that's usually the exception, not the rule."
     Many insurers, such as Chicago-based CNA Insurance Cos., write cherry
insurance only if it's a small part of a large farm's business. "It's just
too volatile," said Lance Mallinson, CNA vice president of commercial lines.
"The loss ratios are horrendous."
     The vulnerability of sweet cherries is pronounced when compared with
other fruits. Cherries are highly susceptible to frost, rain and other
weather conditions. One of the most common production perils is rain near
harvest time, which causes "rain cracking," a condition encouraging fungal
infection.
     Exacerbating the problem is a high demand for dark red cherries,
especially among Pacific Rim importers. The darker the cherry the longer it
must remain on the tree before harvest. "Dark cherries almost invite
disaster," said Mr. Luna.
     The situation has become so grim for California's cherry growers that
they appealed to the federal government to reconsider its posture against
insuring the fruit. "We got together with the San Joaquin Agricultural Office
and various consolidated farm services offices in the state to ask the farm
services agency to reconsider cherries for an insurance program," Mr.
Culbertson said.
     Mr. Murphy said he received the growers' letter at an opportune time.
"We had just ordered a study on the feasibility of insuring sweet cherries,"
he noted. "The report (by the Economic Research Service of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture) indicated that such a program was feasible."
     The USDA report concluded there would be widespread participation among
sweet cherry growers in a catastrophic insurance plan -- if the premiums were
low enough and the benefits ample.
     "The conclusion is that sweet cherries are insurable, but the risks are
so significant that we will need to proceed with caution," Mr. Murphy said.
The next step in the process is a focus group meeting with growers in March
to determine their interest in participating in the insurance program, he
added.
     "We've got a number of different coverage plans that we'd like to float
to the growers to see which fits them best," Mr. Murphy said. "I'm hopeful
that come this cherry season, we'll have a program up and running."

U.S. EXPORTERS LOOK TOWARD NEW MARKETS IN THE PACIFIC RIM


 By Janet Plume, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Canada and Japan dominate the U.S. fresh fruit and vegetable
export markets, buying more than half of all fresh fruit and vegetables
shipped out of the United States.
     While both markets continue to show promise of strong growth, exporters
are turning their eyes toward relatively new markets in the Pacific Rim where
many countries have experienced trade liberalization, rising incomes and
increased consumer demand for fresh products.
     Apples, oranges and grapefruit lead the U.S. fresh fruit export market
in that order. Approximately half the 663,054 tons of apples, 599,385 tons of
oranges and 481,744 tons of grapefruit that were shipped abroad last year
went to Asia.
     Japan, the largest net food importer in the world, is second to Canada
in overall imports from the United States and normally ranks as the largest
U.S. market for grapefruit, oranges, cherries and some other fruits.
     On another front, California exporters worry that some foreign customers
such as Japan and South Korea could cancel the $26 million in U.S. fresh
fruit and vegetables they buy each year when California growers lose an
irreplaceable crop fumigant. Next month, a state birth defects prevention law
will ban the sale of methyl bromide along with some 200 other chemicals. A
special session of the state legislature is considering repeal of the law.
     Both Japan and Korea require pre-export fumigation with methyl bromide
on certain stone fruits and cherries. Scientists believe methyl bromide
damages the ozone layer, and the fumigant is scheduled to be phased out of
use in the United States by 2001.
     "There is research under way to find viable alternatives," said Sheena
Kuruvilla, international trade manager for the United Fruit and Vegetable
Association. "If we are left with nothing else to use but fumigants, then we
will have a problem. But if we come up with a viable alternative it will
depend on how good that viable alternative is."
     China, which began importing U.S. apples in 1994, is another hot market
for U.S. fruit and vegetable growers. However, imported apples are subject to
a 40 percent tariff, plus a 16 percent value-added tax that keeps costs high
and volume low. U.S. growers also dislike the Chinese rule that requires
medfly traps in every warehouse where apples are stored for shipment to
China. Exporters say the traps are unnecessary because the medfly could not
exist in the Northwest's cold climate.
     The first shipment of Florida grapefruit since trade barriers came down
made its way to Thailand last year. U.S. exporters pay a 57 percent tariff,
which is reduced 3 percent each year. But 1996 exports of any of Florida's
produce are likely to become more expensive this year in the wake of a deadly
freeze that gripped the nation earlier this month. The rise in prices caused
by the shortages is likely to result in lower export volume, agriculture
officials said.
     The United States has been the major supplier of fresh fruits and
vegetables to Taiwan for several years. The top U.S. seller in this category
is apples, followed by grapes, plums, grapefruit and other citrus products.
U.S. kiwis have held onto a lead market share in the face of new competition
from French and Chilean imports, as well as from traditional New Zealand
suppliers. U.S. exporters nearly dominate the fresh onion, lettuce and celery
markets in Taiwan.

LACK OF FEDERAL FUNDS DELAYS MANY PROJECTS TO RELIEVE AIRPORT CONGESTION


 By Ted Gogoll, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--A consistent shortfall in government funding has forced U.S.
airports to seek alternative financing for needed projections and raised the
cry for creation of a National Aviation Infrastructure Development Bank.
     Airports that have traditionally relied on the Airport Improvement
Program (AIP) to fund construction projects have found a growing gap between
the money authorized by Congress and the actual funds legislators are making
available.
     The funds, which are distributed by the Federal Aviation Administration,
are used to improve and construct runways, taxiways, aircraft parking aprons
and to modernize safety and efficiency equipment.
     While the authorizations have annually increased, the amount of money
actually appropriated by Congress has decreased from a high of $1.9 billion
in 1992 to $1.45 billion in 1996, a figure airport officials say is
inadequate to handle their expansion needs. To meet the shortfall, airports
have had to rely increasingly on tapping the bond market, using passenger and
shipper fees.
     "We have done a periodic survey to find out what airports really need
over a five-year period. We consistently see that airports (collectively)
need at least $10 billion a year in capital development funding," said Rob
Wigington, senior vice president of Airports Council International-North
America, an organization that represents local, state and regional governing
bodies that own commercial service airports in the United States, Canada and
Bermuda.
     Even when the airports pool all of their financial resources, they still
fall short of necessary funding.
     "Congress is saying that airports are bringing in $3.5 billion in bonds
outside of the AIP, and the passenger and shipper taxes would bring in an
additional $1 billion a year with less than $7 billion in total. The airports
still need $3 billion more a year, but that's the best the (AIP) program
could do," said Mr. Wigington.
     According to the FAA, 22 airports in the United States have "serious"
congestion problems, experiencing more than 20,000 hours of delay a year.
These delays result in $32 million in added costs to airlines. The FAA
forecasts that, unless necessary capacity investments are made, the number of
congested airports will increase to more than 32 by the year 2006.
     Addressing the two-headed problem, FAA Administrator David Hinson said,
"We cannot afford the billions of dollars in annual delay costs and lost
productivity to the airlines, air travelers and businesses, nor can we afford
to weaken our economic competitiveness abroad, by permitting an inefficient
and inadequate air transportation system."
     Meanwhile, the lack of funding has placed many projects on the back
burner. The Airports Council International's Mr. Wigington placed the backlog
at about $8 billion, with some projects sitting on the shelf for upwards of
seven years.
     "When we apply for grants, we apply between October and January.
Generally, right after the first of the year, the grant will come
through...But these projects have been on the books for several years at the
FAA," said Chip Snowden, manager of aviation planning for Jacksonville
International Airport.
     Airport and airline officials note the problem of delayed construction
is not confined to cosmetic alterations but also involves important safety
projects.
     "When dealing with safety and efficiency of the aviation system, it
makes no sense to have to wait," said Mr. Wigington.
     A possible solution to the current budget problems has been proposed by
the Airports Council and the American Association of Airport Executives. The
latter represents executives who manage primary, commercial service, reliever
and general aviation airports in the United States. They began talks in 1994
to spearhead a National Aviation Infrastructure Development Bank.
     As envisioned, the congressionally established bank would be funded by
existing aviation taxes and user fees.
     "Given that aviation has a good flow of revenues, we could set up an
entity outside of the government process and generate sufficient capital in
the private-sector market," said Mr. Wigington.
     Currently, money is put into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund
(established in 1970), which is financed by taxes on passenger tickets,
domestic air cargo and noncommercial aviation fuel. The fund supports 70
percent of the FAA's operating expenses and also provides grants for airports
through the AIP. The NAIDB would take over a large part of the trust fund
duties.
     "It would be the sole way to fund the AIP, so that the trust fund would
no longer pay for the AIP but be funded by this infrastructure bank," said
Mr. Wigington. "The trust fund would pay for FAA operational expenses, so it
would separate the capital equipment programs and have it funded by the
bank."
     Supporters of the proposal stress that the bank would be created without
an increase in user fees on shippers and passengers.
     "It would be a very strong creditworthy entity because of its access to
aviation revenues," said Mr. Wigington. "We would be able to generate between
$14 billion and $25 billion over a 10-year period. That revenue stream would
come into the bank through various user fees.
     "The beauty of it is that we propose keeping the fees at the same level,
so there is no additional tax or fee burden...It is essentially privatizing
the funding. We would take the cargo waybill tax and leave it the way it is.
The private sector can do a lot more with funding, especially because the FAA
cannot go and borrow money (from the primary markets)."
     Under the NAIDB plan, the bank would serve to collect fees and handle
all financing, while the FAA would still make the decisions on what to buy
and when. In essence, Congress would still authorize all the funding, said
Mr. Wigington.
     Donna McLean, a spokeswoman for House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee's Aviation Subcommittee, said the subcommittee supports more
funding for airports but has reservations concerning the NAIDB and potential
budget problems.
     "There are a couple of problems with the bank, such as budget-scoring
problems. Basically what they are suggesting is using the user fees, and
(taking money) away from the trust fund, which we believe will cause
problems," said Mrs. McLean. "I'm not convinced that the airport system needs
to be borrowing money. If you look at your personal budget, you would borrow
money to buy a house or for one-time needs.
     "But when talking about the national airport system, you'll have
continual payments. In your personal budget, you wouldn't borrow to buy
food," she said.
     Mrs. McLean said that, despite the bank's potential, it probably won't
pass in Congress when it comes up for debate.
     "We will continue to look at this issue during the AIP reauthorization
discussion. We are certainly interested in discussing new approaches to
securing additional funding for the airports and other FAA programs. But,
initially, while (the plan is) appealing, the budget problems could mean the
bank proposal's downfall," said Mrs. McLean.
     The AIP is also preparing for its reauthorization, come this fall, as
its current two-year authorization expires. Hearings are set to begin on Feb.
29 and continue until March 20 to discuss the next AIP reauthorization
period.
     "We are not sure if this time around it will be a multiyear or a single
year," said Victoria Pannell, vice president of public affairs for the
Airports Council International. She said the AIP authorization will depend,
in part, on the still-to-be-determined financial status of the FAA's new Air
Traffic Control Corp.

STREAMLINING CUSTOMS IS HEMISPHERIC GOAL


 By Maria Carlino, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--The dizzying list of customs procedures and requirements
throughout the Americas has been a nightmare for exporters and importers.
     With the recent proliferation of regional trade pacts, customs officials
from Canada to Chile have joined forces to begin simplifying the maze.
Governments are working together to streamline paperwork and cut back on red
tape, expedite cargo clearance at border crossings, harmonize rules of origin
and rid agencies of fraud and corruption.
     For example, Canada, Mexico and the United States are poised to
introduce a prototype for standardized electronic documentation to clear
goods through customs at their borders. The Information Exchange and
Automation Working Group, a trilateral panel created under the 1994 North
American Free Trade Agreement, is spearheading the project.
     "The problem with our borders is not that free trade doesn't work. It's
the fact that we don't get information on these transactions until the
shipment arrives," said Robert Ehinger, director of international trade data
exchange for U.S. Customs.
     Under the program, the three countries would standardize trade data
gathered by customs officials to the point where cargo documentation arrives
at the border crossing before the truck or train does. This way, customs
officials would have enough information to decide whether to stop the
shipment for inspection or let it move through immediately.
     The procedure will apply to automotive parts, beer and liquor,
electronics, fresh fruits and vegetables, lumber, newsprint, steel, textiles
and apparel at two U.S.-Canada crossings and four Mexico-U.S. crossings. The
prototype was originally scheduled to be used in the field for a minimum of
six months beginning in January, but will probably not be launched until the
fall, Mr. Ehinger said.
     He attributed the delay in part to the U.S. government shutdowns in
recent months, adding that the schedule depends on getting the proper
technology in place along the borders.
     Officials are also working to develop a hemisphere-wide customs
procedures guide, one of the mandates trade ministers from 34 nations set
last June during a summit meeting in Denver to prepare countries for a
free-trade zone spanning North, Central and South America. The ministers will
meet again in March to work toward making hemispheric integration a reality
by 2005.
     In early February, the Working Group on Customs Procedures and Rules of
Origin, one of seven technical groups established during the summit, met in
La Paz, Bolivia, to start work on the guide. Group members also began
discussing ways to simplify customs procedures, identify areas for technical
cooperation in customs operations such as computerized networks and fraud
prevention as well as to develop a transparent system of rules of origin.
Origin rules, which determine where a product is made or what percentage of a
product is made in a specific country, are pertinent because countries use
them to determine the product's tariff treatment.
     A U.S. customs official who was present at the meeting stressed the
importance of "understanding that we're developing things the same way and
that we're talking about the same things."
     Several South American countries are following the same approach. "With
regard to customs, Mercosur is working hard to coordinate policies and
bureaucratic standards," said Eva Holz, a commercial law professor at the
State University of Uruguay Law School.
     Ms. Holz referred to efforts among Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, the four members of the Southern Cone Common Market customs union
known as Mercosur, to harmonize complicated tariffs and customs regimes. For
example, "in the past, importers and exporters had to go through customs
paperwork with several different state agencies. The countries have agreed to
streamline this whereby you only have to go through customs," she said.
     In addition, Brazil, which has both federal and state regulations, has
made headway in simplifying requirements.
     Ms. Holz stressed that continued economic reform, especially in Brazil
and Argentina, Mercosur's two largest economies, would be key to pushing the
customs standardization process forward.
     Felipe Garcia, an adviser with the National Law Center for
Inter-American Free Trade in Tucson, Ariz., agreed, saying that more
open-door economic policies as well as the advent of high-tech customs
systems would facilitate the development of unified codes and practices.
"Because of technology and other factors this area of trade policy will be
easier to harmonize and change than others," Mr. Garcia said.

DUTCH AIRPORT GIVES EQUAL STATUS TO CARGO, PASSENGERS; AIMS FOR MAINPORT

tatus

 By Bruce Barnard, AirCommerce
 Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News

     Feb. 26--Transportation officials in the Netherlands, fearing
competition for air cargo from other transport centers in northern Europe,
have earmarked over $20 billion for improvements to Amsterdam's Schiphol
Airport.
     Unlike most airports, Schiphol, the home base of KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, gives cargo equal billing with passengers.
     Schiphol got final clearance from the Dutch upper house of Parliament at
the end of November for a 33 billion-guilder ($20.5 billion) expansion
including the construction of a fifth runway to increase the airport's
capacity to 44 million passengers and 3 million tons of freight annually by
2015.
     The plan includes high-speed passenger rail connections linking the
airport to Brussels, Paris and Frankfurt. The government is also supporting a
study for a 220-mile-an-hour rail freight service linking Amsterdam and Paris
airports via Brussels.
     Schiphol has a very clear idea where it wants to be at the beginning of
the 21st century: a mainport for Europe. The aim, according to Hans Smits,
president of Schiphol, is to become "a very sophisticated hub of traffic and
transport by air, rail and road, where optimum management of supply and
demand is the main element."
     Schiphol boosted its cargo business by 9.6 percent to 874,000 tons in
1994 as the fourth busiest cargo center in Europe.
     But that performance was eclipsed by Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport,
where freight surged by 17.6 percent to 898,000 tons, and London's Heathrow,
up 13.4 percent at 1.048 million tons. In fact, Paris and London easily
outpaced Frankfurt, which remains Europe's top cargo airport but grew by only
7.8 percent in 1994 to 1.402 million tons.
     The small loss of overall Europe market share was a setback for an
airport that regularly notched the fastest cargo growth rates in Europe in
the 1980s.
     Cargo figures are carefully studied by the Dutch, where Schiphol starts
with the disadvantage of a small domestic market of less than 15 million
people. Schiphol management, like KLM, has focused on transforming the
airport into a transit point for passengers as well as freight.
     Between 70 percent and 80 percent of freight passing through Schiphol is
bound for other destinations in Europe. And the airport is determined it will
continue handling this "foreign" freight. It takes less than five hours to
clear cargo through Schiphol, compared with 12 to 15 hours at Paris and
Frankfurt.
     One of Schiphol's major assets is KLM, which has made cargo a core
activity. The airline is among a handful of European carriers committed to
the handling of freight through the end of the century.
     A substantial share of Schiphol's cargo arrives by truck from points
across the continent. KLM recently opened its fourth European "minihub," this
one in Zaragosa, northern Spain. It also flies in freight from Manchester,
Malmo, Sweden, and Linz, Austria and has a trucking link with London.
     This dedication, allied to a global surge in air freight movements,
helped Schiphol to raise cargo traffic by 16.5 percent to 473,000 tons in the
first half of 1995, nearly twice the 8.8 percent rise in passenger traffic it
realized in the same period.
     Schiphol planners forecast that both intercontinental passenger and
freight traffic will increase on a small number of European hub airports
served by an equally select breed of scheduled airlines, integrators and
all-cargo carriers.
     On current trends, Schiphol is likely to hold its place among the
world's busiest cargo centers well into the 21st century. There is a huge gap
between Schiphol's fourth place in the cargo rankings and fifth-place Zurich,
which handled just 337,000 tons in 1994.
     But Schiphol's planners say a challenger can make its mark extremely
rapidly. Nearby Brussels, with its ample spare capacity, is an obvious
threat, particularly after Swissair, a dedicated cargo player, acquired a 49
percent stake in Sabena, the Belgian national carrier based at Brussels
Zaventem airport.
     Schiphol isn't taking any chances. It is selling itself as a
distribution point for companies and a center for information and data
communications flows.
     The airport has also forged a marketing alliance with nearby Rotterdam,
the world's biggest seaport, with the appointment of a joint representative
in Tokyo. The Netherlands has already been extremely successful in the
Japanese market: Some 42 percent of all Japanese companies in Europe have
located their operations in the country.
     Looking ahead, Mr. Smits ponders whether Schiphol should consider
alliances with other airport-based companies, to build a new mainport. "A
mainport is no location, it is a major enterprise. It does not think
nationally, but internationally," he said.

CREW ERROR PROBED IN COLOMBIAN CRASH

       A description of the events leading up to the crash of American
Airlines Flight 965 
Dec. 20 in Colombia points strongly to crew error as the probable
cause.
       The Boeing 757-200 was about a dozen miles off course when it
crashed into a mountain as it made a night approach in good weather to
the airport at Cali, Colombia, killing 160 passengers and crew. Four
passengers and a dog survived.
       The report describing the events, prepared from the airplane's
30-minute cockpit voice recording and digital flight data recorder by
Colombian air safety investigators, with assistance from the NTSB and
FAA, depicts the two-man crew as confused about the aircraft's
location as it approached Cali from the north. It says the recordings
revealed no evidence that the crew ran a descent checklist or an
approach procedures briefing. It says there was no evidence of a
mechanical problem, bad weather, bomb or missile, or failure of
pertinent ground-based navigational aids.
       About 63 miles north of the airport, the crew checked in with
Cali Approach Control and was cleared to the Cali VOR (VHF
omnidirectional radio range) near the airport and told to report when
it reached the Tulua VOR on the way. The crew acknowledged the
instruction, according to the report.
       But at some point after the aircraft had already passed south of
the Tulua VOR, the crew programmed the aircraft's flight management
system to fly to the Tulua VOR, the report says. The aircraft, while
continuing to descend, made a 90-second turn to the east, toward the
mountains.
       "Flightcrew discussion took place during this turn regarding a
return to the centerline of the approach course," according to the
report.
       The crew then reset the autopilot and the aircraft turned to the
southwest, back toward the centerline and the airport, according to
the report. 
       Nine seconds before the end of the recordings, the ground
proximity warning system (GPWS) sounded. The GPWS gives crew an
audible warning if the aircraft gets too close to the ground. The crew
increased engine power and pulled up two seconds after the GPWS
warning, the report says. The stick-shaker, a stall-warning, came on
as the crew tried to gain altitude. The flight spoilers, extended
during descent to increase drag, were not retracted, according to the
report.                                                                                      
       The crash of Flight 965 was the worst for a U.S. airliner since
Pan Am Flight 103 crashed in Scotland in 1988, killing all 260 aboard.

FAA STUDYING FEASIBILITY OF CONSOLIDATING THREE BOSTON AREA TRACONS 

       The FAA is looking at whether it can fund the consolidation of
three aging New England terminal radar approach control (TRACON)
facilities into one location.
       The TRACONs at Boston Logan International, Bradley International
in Windsor Locks, Conn., and Manchester Airport in Manchester, N.H.,
are deteriorating, the FAA says. In addition, the facilities would
have to be enlarged to fit new air traffic control (ATC) equipment,
says Ray German, the agency's manager for the Boston Consolidated
TRACON (BCT) project.
       A single TRACON handles arriving and departing traffic within
about 40 miles of an airport. A consolidated TRACON would serve
airspace surrounding all three of the airports. The FAA has
consolidated TRACONs in metropolitan New York City and Southern
California.
       Officials in the FAA's New England region recommended
consolidation after they began looking at the problem of aging
facilities two years ago. This year, the FAA plans to start evaluating
operational, personnel and cost issues for possible sites for the
facility, and now is in the process of choosing a contractor to help.
       The agency is also preparing a cost-benefit study to learn
whether the user benefits of consolidation, such as more direct routes
for aircraft and better management of the region's airspace, can
justify the project's cost, although such benefits are not the main
reason for consolidating the TRACONs, the FAA says. If consolidation
is chosen the controller workforce likely will not be reduced, German
says.
       A decision to fund the project could take as long as a year, he
adds. If consolidation is chosen, the project could be completed as
early as 2002, German says.

FAA QUICKENS STARS PROCUREMENT

       The FAA will award the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement
System (STARS) development contract in April, instead of waiting until
August, because the three firms that passed the pre-bid operational
capability demonstration (OCD) showed significantly more progress than
the agency expected.
       Boeing , Loral and Raytheon, along with their subcontractors,
will be awarded equal value contracts to begin developing STARS, says
FAA spokesman Jeff Thal. The result of funding three separate efforts
is that the FAA will end up with a more mature system, Thal says. The
amount of the contracts has not yet been determined. The early award
date will also allow the contractors to get a jump start on software
development, which the FAA determined from the OCD will take 20 months
rather than 14. By October, after evaluating each company's software,
the FAA will select one firm to complete development, testing, and
production of STARS. The total value of the contract could approach $1
billion. 
       The new equipment, to be installed starting at the end of 1998,
will increase automation of air traffic control, improve weather
displays and provide better surveillance of airspace at more than 220
civilian and military terminal radar approach controls (TRACON)
nationwide.

GEORGIA TRAFFIC EXPERT TO BE NOMINATED TO NTSB

       President Clinton will nominate Georgia transportation official
George Black Jr. to the National Transportation Safety Board, the
White House says.
       Since 1988, Black has been director of transportation for
Gwinnett County, Ga., outside of Atlanta. Black oversees the county's
road, airport, and storm water systems. He has also been a county
traffic engineer, and from 1985 to 1988 was the county's director of
engineering. He co-founded the county police department's fatal
accident investigation unit and has helped investigate more than 1,500
truck and automobile accidents.
       In a statement, the White House says, "Mr. Black's qualifications
and experience as a civil engineer will provide the NTSB with the
technical expertise necessary to evaluate complex highway bridge
design and maintenance issues." Black has a bachelor's degree in civil
engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. During service
in the U.S. Air Force he was a maintenance officer on B-52 and KC-135
aircraft.
       If confirmed by the Senate, Black will fill the remainder of
former member Carl Vogt's term, which expires Dec. 31, 1996. The
current board members are: Chairman Jim Hall, whose term expires Dec.
31, 1997; Vice Chairman Robert Francis (Dec. 31, 1999), and John
Goglia (Dec. 31, 1998). John Hammerschmidt's term ended Dec. 31. His
seat remains unfilled.

FAA SAYS PROPOSED FLIGHT AND DUTY TIME RULES TO COST $899 MILLION 

       The flight and duty time rules for pilots proposed by the FAA
last month as part of a large initiative will cost carriers $899
million over the next 15 years, according to the agency. 
       One provision of the rules, however, would offset these costs by
allowing airline pilots to work longer hours. An increase in the
maximum permitted flight time from eight to 10 hours for two-pilot
crews would produce savings of $1.8 billion in current dollars, the
FAA estimates.
       The Commuter Safety Initiative (CSI), unveiled Dec. 14, included
three separate rules to create `one level of safety' for all airlines.
The commuter rule brings all scheduled airlines operating aircraft
with 10 to 30 seats under Part 121, the rules that govern carriers
operating aircraft with more than 30 seats. The commuter rule and the
air carrier training rule, which require commuters to upgrade their
training, are both final rules. The flight, duty, and rest time rule
is a proposed rule, which means the FAA must consider public comments
before finalizing it (Air Safety Week, Dec. 18, 1995,).
       According to FAA calculations, the commuter rule will cause the
price of a one-way airline ticket to increase by $0.62 for carriers
operating aircraft with 10 to 19 seats and $0.30 for carriers with 20
to 30 seat airplanes. The total cost to airlines of implementing the
rule will be $75 million in current dollars. Initial compliance costs,
however, will be much higher than on-going costs. On a per airplane
basis, the cost to upgrade a 10 to 19 seat airplane will be $19,400
and $21,900 for a 20 to 30 seat airplane in 1996.
       The costliest provision of the flight and duty time rule applies
to the scheduling of reserve pilots who must be available to report
for work at short notice. The proposal requires that allowable duty
time be reduced for reserves who are given less than 10 hours of
notice. Currently, there are no additional restrictions placed on the
duty time of reserve pilots. The FAA estimates that this provision
will cost Part 121 carriers $73 million a year over the next 15 years.
The requirement to count ferry flights toward flight and duty time
limits could cost Part 121 airlines flying unscheduled operations $17
million a year.  
       Despite vociferous opposition to the CSI by Alaskan commuter
carriers and air tour operators concerned about the rule's economic
impact, the FAA did not exempt them from meeting Part 121 standards,
saying these operations are not sufficiently different from other
commuter operations to merit an exemption. 
       The proposed flight and duty time rule reduces the number of duty
hours from 16 to 14 for two-pilot crews. A duty period is the time a
crew member is at work and available to fly. The maximum length of the
duty period increases as the number of pilots in the crew increases. 

  ... Certification Regulations for Airports, Carriers and Aircraft
Also Addressed

       Airports. Commuter airlines still will be allowed to serve
airports that have not been certified under Part 139, the rules
governing airports served by airplanes with more than 30 seats. These
airports will not be required to meet the air carrier standards, since
the FAA is prohibited by federal law from regulating airports that
serve airplanes with 30 or fewer seats. Should Congress pass
legislation allowing the FAA to regulate airports serving airplanes
with 10 to 30 seats, the agency has assigned the Aviation Rulemaking
Advisory Committee to recommend the requirements in Part 139 that
should be applied to airports now serving commuter operations.
       Carriers. The commuter rule creates a new part, Part 119, that
consolidates certification, operations and maintenance requirements
for Part 121 and Part 135 operations.
       Aircraft. Starting in March, the rule requires all new type
certifications for 10- to 19-seat airplanes to meet transport category
standards, Part 25. The existing fleet of this size aircraft can
continue to operate under their current type certification, but must
meet upgraded equipment and performance requirements.

LEGAL DECISIONS

* ADMINISTRATOR V. BUTCHKOSKY, NTSB ORDER NO. EA-4407, NOV. 30, 1995. 
The NTSB affirmed the revocation of the airman certificates of Alex
Butchkosky, who had appealed Administrative Law Judge William Pope's
affirmation of the FAA's revocation. The FAA revoked Butchkosky's
certificates because in 1989 he was convicted in U.S. District Court
of three offenses involving importation and distribution of marijuana
and because when applying for a medical certificate in 1990 he
answered "no" to the question of whether he had ever been convicted of
a crime. Butchkosky said he was told by a representative of the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association that convictions under appeal
did not have to be reported. Pope said Butchkosky "did not honestly
believe that he had no criminal convictions when he completed his
medical certificate." The board said it would not challenge a judge's
credibility finding unless there was evidence it was arbitrary.

*  Administrator v. Larson, NTSB Order No. EA-4408, Dec. 1, 1995. The
NTSB denied the appeal of Alan Larson, an Alaska Island Air Inc. pilot
whom the FAA fined $15,000 for flying a DC-3 in September 1993 without
a qualified second-in-command, flying an aircraft that was not
airworthy, and falsifying a flight log. Larson appealed to the NTSB
after Administrative Law Judge Patrick Geraghty upheld the fine but
reduced it to $13,000. In his appeal to the board, Larson made three
arguments. He argued, for the first time during the case, that the FAA
had no jurisdiction over most of the more than 50 flights it cited in
its complaint because the DC-3 was being operated as a public
aircraft, and therefore was not subject to the Federal Aviation
Regulations the FAA claims Larson violated. The board discarded that
argument because Larson admitted the FAA's allegation in its complaint
that the DC-3 in question was a civil aircraft. Second, the board said
that although the flights were paid for by the U.S. government, that
did not necessarily mean the aircraft should have been designated a
public aircraft. Finally, the board said that even if Larson had been
flying a public aircraft, many FARs would still have applied. Because
the civil status of the aircraft was not in dispute as the case was
litigated, the board said it had no reason to pick through the
violations after the fact to see which might have applied and which
might have been dismissed, and how that reassessment might have
affected the penalty the FAA assessed.

*  Administrator v. Kline, NTSB Order No. EA-4409, Nov. 30, 1995. The
NTSB granted, in part, the appeal of the FAA after Administrative Law
Judge William Mullins reversed part of the FAA's decision to suspend
the private pilot certificate of Forrest Kline for flying too low over
a house in Rimrock, Ariz., several times in August 1994. The FAA had
suspended Kline's certificate for 120 days, claiming he violated
Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Section 91.13(a) by flying his World
War I biplane carelessly or recklessly and FAR Section 91.119(c) by
flying less that 500 feet over a house that was just off the end of
the runway at a private airport in Rimrock. Because of the terrain at
that airport, aircraft land and depart in opposite directions, which
requires departing aircraft to make a sharp right-hand turn after
takeoff, according to NTSB documents. Kline appealed to the judge, who
upheld the violation of Section 91.13 but dismissed the violation of
Section 91.119, saying the right-hand turn after takeoff was
appropriate. The judge reduced the suspension to 45 days. The FAA
appealed the judge's decision to the NTSB, which reinstated the
violation of Section 91.119, saying there was no reason Kline could
not have delayed his right turn slightly to avoid flying over the
house. The NTSB left the suspension at 45 days, arguing that the two
charges were duplicative.

TWO MEN CONVICTED OF MAKING/SELLING COUNTERFEIT PARTS FOR BOEING 727S

 *  Two men and their companies were convicted Dec. 15 in federal
criminal court of making and selling counterfeit parts for Boeing
727s. Arthur Stewart and his company Gary Aerospace Corp. of Hondo,
Texas, and Jose Mendiola and his company, JLM Aviation International
Inc. of Naperville, Ill., will be sentenced March 12. Stewart and Gary
Aerospace were convicted of conspiring to manufacture fake Boeing slat
track roller bolt assemblies, according to the DOT. Mendiola and JLM
were convicted of conspiring to sell the fake assemblies to domestic
buyers and to Mexicana Airlines. Mendiola and JLM also were convicted
of submitting false statements to federal authorities. Both men and
their companies also were convicted of mail and wire fraud. The FAA
notified carriers of the fake parts early in the DOT's investigation.

INDUSTRY TASK FORCE REPORT IS "FIRST-CLASS

*  An official FAA response isn't due until later this month, but FAA
Administrator David Hinson says an industry task force report on
implementation of free flight is "first-class." RTCA Task Force 3
presented its report to Hinson in October. It lays out a path to free
flight, the more direct routing of aircraft using communications,
navigation and surveillance technology. FAA Associate Administrator
for Regulation and Certification Tony Broderick said, "We agree in
principle with the recommendations." Among the report's 44
recommendations is a call for a government-industry free flight
steering group to pick up where the task force left off.

A WORN MAGNETO & PILOT ERROR COMBINED CAUSED CRASH OF PILATUS BRITTEN-
NORMAN BN2A-20 ISLANDER

*  A worn magneto and pilot error combined to cause the December 1993
crash of a Pilatus Britten-Norman BN2A-20 Islander on a night flight
from Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, to Inuvik, the Transportation
Safety Board of Canada has found. All seven aboard were killed when
the plane crashed eight miles south of the Inuvik airstrip. The board
said the right engine's left-hand magneto (Bendix S6LN-1227) had
excessive wear between the flyweight and axle pin, which led to
magneto failure and right engine failure. Investigators could find no
evidence that the aircraft operator, Arctic Wings and Rotors, had
complied with an FAA airworthiness directive (AD-78-09-07 R3, issued
Jan. 17, 1983) that called for inspection of the magnetos. Further,
the board found that after the right engine failed the pilot rotated
the rudder trim wheel in the wrong direction, which compounded the yaw
and roll to the right.

DANGER OF FRAGMENTATION AS ICAO RETAINS NOISE RULES

     An international environmental group's proposal to maintain
Chapter 3 noise limits for now and impose only slight changes in
aircraft emissions regulations could spur individual countries,
regions and airports to implement their own rules governing aircraft
environmental issues, making the situation more complicated than it is
today.
     Strengthening aircraft noise rules might have driven down the
value of older aircraft. Many airlines have already spent large sums
to hushkit older aircraft to meet Chapter 3 requirements, which will
be mandatory as of Jan. 1, 1997.
     Instead, the group's decision to retain Chapter 3 limits on
aircraft noise appears to provide welcome relief for airlines.
Increasing the stringency of noise rules would have impacted the
McDonnell Douglas MD-80 series and Boeing 737 series. 
     The absence of any change in noise rules and only a modest
reduction in emissions provides comfort for used aircraft values. But
it is only superficial. Airlines will be allowed to continue operating
their Stage 3 equipment until well into the next century but the
threat of restriction has not passed. Over the course of the next year
it will be vital to monitor the progress of the EC in formulating non-
addition rules on both noise and emissions. 
     The International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) Committee
on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP/3), meeting December 5-15
in Montreal, recommended that the present Annex 16, Chapter 3,
relating to aircraft noise limits, be retained for the foreseeable
future. The group also asked the ICAO's full council to accept a
proposal reducing aircraft NOx levels by 15-16%. 
     Compared to the proposed measures, the group's decisions on noise
and emissions represent the most lenient increases that could have
been anticipated. But rather than settling these issues, its decisions
could result in a fragmentation of policy, with regions and countries
introducing their own measures, providing confusion rather than
clarification.
     The U.S. and European Commission sought to support their own
interests, making the Montreal meeting an intensely political affair.
The EC was anxious to increase limits on noise since stricter rules
may have increased the retirement rate of older and predominantly
U.S.- manufactured aircraft, giving European manufacturers business
opportunities as airlines sought replacement aircraft. Not
surprisingly, the U.S. position in Montreal highlighted the cost of
implementing additional noise restrictions, particularly in terms of
lower aircraft values.
     The lack of agreement on the retention of Chapter 3 noise levels
may not provide the status quo that the U.S. and others had sought,
however. The failure to compromise may allow both camps to pursue
their own objectives.
     The lack of any agreement on noise as opposed to a compromise,
may spur Europe to pursue its own policy without having to take
account of supra-national recommendations. The EC can be expected to
push for further non-addition rules sooner rather than later. The
primary targets will be the MD-80 series and hushkitted aircraft whose
emissions, even after modification, are seen as falling outside the
EC's minimum standards. 
     A 3 decibel reduction of the sideline measurement compared to the
present Chapter 3 rules will also impact a significant number of
widebodies unless bypass ratio engines of greater than two are once
again exempted. 
     Should the EC proceed with a non-addition rule, some response
from the U.S. must be expected.
     The lack of any ICAO recommendation on noise increases the
likelihood that airports will pursue their own individual policies
involving a plethora of different restrictions. The absence of
"Chapter 4" may make it easier for the airframe and engine
manufacturers to produce the next series of large widebodies, but with
older aircraft being allowed to remain in service for that much
longer, new sales may be impacted. 
     CAEP/3's proposal to lower NOx levels follows the 20% reduction
in NOx agreed to by ICAO in the early 1990s when the EC was pressing
for a 40% cut. 
     The NOx proposal reflects the current level of technology and
applies to newly certificated engines as of Dec. 31, 1999 and
production engines as of Dec. 31, 2007. The airframe/engine
combinations apparently impacted by the recommendation include the Tay
650 on the Fokker 100, the PW2040 on the 757, the CFM56-5B1 and -5B2
on the A321, and the PW4168 and Trent 768 on the A330. But as the cut-
off point is some 11 years away, manufacturers will have ample time to
introduce the required marginal improvement in NOx emissions, although
a non-addition rule imposed by EC countries will make it difficult for
the manufacturers to plan ahead. 
     There remains considerable concern about the impact of aircraft
emissions on the environment and with research still being undertaken,
the cautious approach of ICAO seems justified. 
     The NOx decision was a compromise favoring the U.S. lobby, passed
by a 10-4 majority. Since CAEP/3 did not agree unanimously there is
every indication that the ICAO council will reject the recommendation,
thereby retaining the status quo. In the event ICAO fails to adopt the
recommendation, this again will allow the EC to pursue its own policy
with a non-addition rule also expected to be adopted. 
     Recommendations of CAEP/3 require approval by the ICAO Council
before they can take effect.

BOEING RETURN TO WORK DAMPENS SURGE IN USED VALUES

     The return to work by Boeing machinists last month after a 10-
week strike was a relief to customers, but for owners of used aircraft
there was a measure of disappointment. 
     The lack of new availability was beginning to raise values for
some used aircraft by an appreciable amount. The prospect of further
rises in used values were impacted by Boeing's announcement that it
intends to increase production rates to compensate for the strike and
accommodate additional demand. Boeing has, however, instructed its
suppliers to reduce production rates to avoid oversupply of
components. 
     By the end of the first quarter of 1996, Boeing expects
production to be at pre-strike levels and in the fourth quarter
production of the 737 will increase from seven to eight and a half
units per month. This reverses a previously announced plan to reduce
737 production to five per month as of April 1996. Production of the
747 will rise from two to three and a half per month also by the
fourth quarter of 1996 and the 767 will increase from three and a half
to four units per month at the same time. The 777 will seen an
increase from three and a half units per month to five units in early
1997. The reduction in the production of the 757 from four to three
units will be delayed from June to September 1996. The changes in
production are relatively modest and reflect a spate of recent orders.
     China Airlines has become the latest customer for the new 737,
ordering six -800s with options for an additional nine. Boeing values
the order and options at $750 million, or nearly $47 million per
aircraft, which equates to the list price. A total of 220 orders have
now been placed for the new generation 737.

BOEING CLOSER TO LAUNCHING 747 DERIVATIVES

     Boeing Commercial Airplane Group is moving closer to launching
two derivatives of its popular 747, as the airplane maker is "actively
exploring" options for the aircraft with potential customers, says Ron
Woodard, BCAG President, in a Jan 4 press conference.
     In announcing Boeing's 1995 market share results, Woodard said
Asia will become Boeing's largest market and that Boeing has the 747-
500X and 747-600X under study. He declined to say which carriers are
driving the studies, but industry experts expect them to be major
Asian airlines.
     On the chances for a launch in 1996, Woodard says he "would be
surprised if a decision was made on that this year, but it could
happen."
     The 747-500X would have a new, larger wing, about an 8,000-mile
range and the same passenger capacity as the 747-400. The -600X would
have the same new wing, but would be larger, carrying about 100 more
passengers than the 747-400. In high-capacity routes in Asia, a one-
class configuration of the 747-600X could carry more than 660 people. 
     Woodard says Boeing would launch both versions as a family, if
the market demanded it. Even with the 747 possibilities, the 737
remains Boeing's bread and butter money-maker. Of 346 Boeing aircraft
ordered in 1995, 176 were 737s, including 129 newer -600, -700 and -
800 versions. Boeing also said its 346 orders include 85 jets from
nine customers that had not been announced or that were intentions to
order.



Boeing's 1995 Orders

Model     US        Non-Us    Total     Value*

 "The largest market over the next 20 years will be for smaller
aircraft" below 200 seats, he says. Growth versions of the best-
selling 737, especially the 737-800, are putting pressure on the 757,
and Boeing also is evaluating a stretch of the 757.
     Boeing's 1995 market share for new aircraft orders rose to 69.7%,
compared with Airbus' 14.8% and McDonnell Douglas' 9.9%. The remaining
5.6% market share went to 70-seat or more jet builders, mostly British
Aerospace and Fokker. In 1994, Boeing and Airbus both had 41% of the
market. Woodard projects Boeing to have a 67% market share during the
next 20 years.
     Woodard notes that Boeing won more than 90% of the 1995 orders
from Europe. Foreign orders accounted for 88% of Boeing's 1995 orders,
and it delivered 206 jets last year, 29 fewer than expected. In the
1980s, North America was the largest market, with Asia third. From
1995 through 2014, Woodard says Asia will be No. 1, followed by North
America and Europe.

AIRLINES SCRAMBLE WITH TICKET TAX, REFUND SCHEMES

     U.S. airlines have a headache that won't go away. Lack of a
federal budget resolution, which has prevented airlines from
collecting the 10% ticket and other taxes, has airline managers
scratching their heads, eyeing competitors' moves and trying to figure
out how to give refunds to millions of passengers who bought tickets
in 1995 and paid taxes that airlines temporarily cannot collect.
     "Anyone who had expected a quiet start to the new year has been
greatly disappointed," noted Air Transport Association spokesman Chris
Chiames. Most U.S. carriers have scrambled to change and drop nearly
every fare by 10% and begin refunding taxes to passengers without
creating an administrative nightmare. One fare was listed as $89.10,
10% off a $99 fare. 
     In the meantime, as airlines looked to the Internal Revenue
Service for guidance, they received none. The ATA blasted the IRS last
week for being "caught flat-footed and unable to provide guidance" on
an issue that was discussed for several weeks.
     The U.S. Treasury estimates that $5.9 billion in ticket, cargo
and associated departure taxes were to be collected in the current
fiscal year, or about $16 million each day. Most airlines, including
American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines chose to
reduce prices immediately by 10%. Southwest Airlines is a notable
exception, choosing to raise fares 10% for a short-term gain.
     United Airlines, which lowered fares late last week, sees winter
fare sales driving ticket sales much more than tax savings. "It's too
early to tell how the ticket tax issue will effect the market," says
United's Tony Molinaro. "We'll look at it mid-month." United flies
200,000 people each day.
     When the budget showdown ends, the fun may begin on collecting
back taxes. "We believe that no excise tax can be enacted
retroactively," says Chiames. "It would be impossible to collect. The
IRS would have to collect it." Hopefully.

AIRBORNE EXPRESS CHOOSES USED 767s IN $600 MILLION COMMITMENT

     Airborne Express is buying 12 used Boeing 767-200s as part of a
$600 million long-term decision to add wide-bodied aircraft to its
growing fleet of 109 planes. Following a year-long study, Airborne
chose the 767 over both the Airbus A300B4 and the McDonnell Douglas
10-10.
     Nine of the 12 will be acquired from Itochu Air Lease Corp.,
with the remaining three from Marubeni Corp. Airborne bought the 12,
plus spares and major modification to cargo configuration, for $290
million.
     Airborne also will acquire 10-15 more 767-200s in the next eight
years at a total cost of $310 million. The first two 767s will arrive
in 1997, followed by four in '98, four in '99 and two in 2000. The
move "should decrease operating costs while keeping capital
requirements relatively unchanged," the airline said.
     The 767 has many operating advantages over other aircraft of the
same size, mostly due to newer, fuel-efficient engines and a two-
person crew. Airborne figures its 767s will have a 14% lower direct
operating cost per hour than the DC-8, 17% less than the A300 and 43%
less than the DC-10-10.
     Among the factors in Airborne's 767 decision were: to acquire
aircraft that could serve markets that it is outgrowing with DC-8s;
the ability to fly unrestricted payloads transcontinentally, and to
fly at an aircraft utilization rate of at around 12 hours or more per
day. 
     Airborne now operates a fleet of 63 DC-9s, 35 DC-8s and 11 YS-
11s. The carrier says it has no plans to retire any aircraft as a
result of the purchase decision, and has been adding eight to 10 DC-9s
and DC-8s annually and plans to continue that rate.

HARRIS BRINGS START-UP PLANS TO AIR CANADA BOARD

     Air Canada Chairman Hollis Harris again is expressing his desire
to start a low-cost airline in the U.S., possibly when he "retires"
from Air Canada late next year. In a year-end interview, Harris said
he discussed his ideas with the Air Canada board of directors and even
floated the idea of the airline investing in his new carrier and
selling him up to 35 McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s.
     "I think there will be another ValuJet," he said, noting that if
he doesn't use the DC-9s, some other start-up airline could do the
same. Harris said he told his board that the new venture would not
compete against Air Canada.
     The airline's DC-9s, 11 of which are owned and 24 leased, are
expected to come out of Air Canada's fleet in 1997. The jets have an
average age of 26 years.
     A new U.S. carrier with the same equipment and roughly the same
costs as ValuJet would be formidable.
     "It could easily squeeze some smaller start-ups out of
existence," says an industry analyst, depending on which city it would
call home. Beginning a hub in Atlanta (ValuJet's home) or Dallas
(Southwest's) would be extremely risky, pointing to a possible
invasion of smaller low-cost carrier hubs in Denver (Western
Pacific's) or Orlando (AirTran's).
     Since Harris and ValuJet President Lewis Jordan live in the same
small Georgia town - Peachtree City -and know each other well, some
sort of joint DC-9 operation also could be possible. ValuJet currently
is expanding its fleet to 43 aircraft this month, meaning an airline
operating Air Canada's 35 DC-9s would nearly equal ValuJet in size.
     Sources say Air Canada should want a stake in the new carrier,
especially with its new found financial health and a desire not to let
a start-up eat up its profitable U.S.-Canada routes or ruin its
margins.
     Air Canada and its regional airlines have launched or will
launch service on 30 new routes by March, and a start-up alliance with
'Air Hollis' would make it formidable into many north-south markets.
Within the last few months, Air Canada began new non-stop service
between Canada and Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington,
Houston, Las Vegas and Minneapolis.
     Air Canada reported a net profit of $94 million for 1994 and $50
million for the first nine months of 1995. Its 120-jet fleet includes
21 new aircraft. Air Canada operates 500 daily flights, and also takes
advantage of 83 aircraft from five feeder airlines, all of which are
100% owned by Air Canada.

HAGERTY TAKES OVER AS INDEPENDENCE AIR STARTS ITS ENGINES

     Independence Air, a new Atlanta-based, wide-body airline that
has yet to receive its certificate of airworthiness, has hired airline
veteran Roy Hagerty as president and CEO.
     Independence intends to obtain government approvals and begin
operations by May 1, Hagerty tells AFN in an exclusive interview.
Independence had hoped to start operations last year [AFN, July 3,
1995].
     The new carrier will operate two Airbus A300B4s 11 hours per day
for passenger and freight service from New York and Atlanta to Los
Angeles. "We expect to offer fares 20% less than the lowest
unrestricted fare, and, on average, our fares will be 50% lower that
what the marketplace now offers," Hagerty says. "We expect to
stimulate additional cost-to-coast travel," he says, much the way
ValuJet Airlines has seen local traffic jump when it enters a market.
     Hagerty, former CEO of USAir Express carrier CCAIR Inc., was
responsible for the commuter airline's fully subscribed initial public
offering in 1989. The two million-share offering was led by Merrill
Lynch. Although it wasn't mandatory, Hagerty is investing in
Independence. He replaces Barry Harris, who ended a short seven-week
stint as CEO to return to his Washington, D.C. government affairs
consultancy.
     Independence Air had raised $500,000 in 1995 and expects another
$2.2 million by the end of the first quarter. "We expect to go public
sometime this year," he says. Most of the airline's managers, like
Hagerty, have 25 years of airline experience.
     Hagerty also expects Independence to make a profit as it starts
operating, since its unit and fixed costs will be low. Seat mile costs
in the four cent range. Transcontinental tickets prices will be as low
as $119.
     The airline has had tentative discussions to secure operating
leases for its airplane of choice - the A300 - but hasn't signed a
contract. During the first phase of operation, Hagerty expects to need
a minimum of eight A300s. "That's all contingent on early profits," he
stresses.
     Independence sees early cargo volume helping its balance sheet.
The airline also has seen "a lot of interest on from freight
forwarders, since we have a low-cost wide-body to offer."

NORTHWEST APPROVED TO FLY FIRST NONSTOP US-CHINA SERVICE

     Northwest Airlines will fly the first non-stop service from the
U.S. to China, receiving authority just before the new year to fly
Detroit-Beijing.
     The new service will start May 1 with three flights per week
using Boeing 747-400s. The government approval would have allowed
Northwest to start April 7 at the earliest.
     The U.S. signed its 29th international aviation pact with China
Dec. 23, which should lead to more route authority approval in the
coming months. The new nonstop service will save time and money for
airlines and passengers by allowing them to bypass Tokyo, the
traditional Asian gateway to China.
     The new bilateral gives Northwest nine flights per week to
China, phased in over the next two years. FedEx receives four
frequencies immediately, and China Southern is allowed to serve the
U.S., both for passenger and cargo.
     Northwest, though, is the big winner, adding to its already
burgeoning business to Asia. Northwest's Pacific Division had a 12%
profit margin for the third quarter ending Sept. 30 [AFN, Dec. 25,
1995]. 
     The airline reported in its Form 41 reports to the U.S.
Department of Transportation that it had $836 million in Pacific
operating revenue, $170 million in operating income and $100 million
in net profit for the third quarter.
     Northwest President and CEO John Dasburg said General Motors,
Ford and Chrysler provided "valuable assistance" in lobbying for the
China rights. The airline will fly the "Great Circle" route to China,
over Alaska and eastern Russia. The 6,600-mile flight will take 13
hours. Northwest began service to Shanghai in 1947, reinstating it in
1984; today it operates one weekly flight through Tokyo. It also flies
thrice weekly to Beijing through Tokyo.

AIRBUS WINS LARGE PHILIPPINE AIRLINES ORDER

     Airbus won a plum order for 24 aircraft of three types from
Philippines Airlines, securing a long-term role with a carrier that
has exclusively operated Boeing 747s on its long-haul routes. The
order was announced Dec. 29, bolstering a sagging Airbus orderbook for
1995.
     PAL ordered four A340-300s, eight A330-300s and 12 A320s.
Deliveries of the first A340 and A330 will begin in the second quarter
of 1997. PAL had ordered four A340-200s, the first of which will enter
into service by the end of this year.
     A statement by Airbus said PAL's A320s will "become the
airline's sole single-aisle aircraft type," which means the carrier's
11 Boeing 737-300s - all leased - would become available. PAL has a
fairly new fleet of 737s, with the oldest jet manufactured in 1988.
     Asian newspapers report that Boeing won part of the PAL order,
possibly for several 747-400s, but the airplane maker says nothing has
been signed with PAL.

YEMENIA ORDERS NEW A310s

     Yemenia-Yemen Airways has placed its first aircraft order with
Airbus on Dec. 31, ordering two A310s and taking options on two
others. Delivery of the initial two jets is planned for March 1997.
Yemenia, which is a different carrier than Boeing operator Yemen
Airways, has a current fleet of two leased A310-200s, according to
FedEx Aviation Services. The Middle East airline will use the new
aircraft on routes to Europe, Southeast Asia and the U.S., as well as
regional routes, Airbus said.

     Net income of all U.S. carriers last year was expected to remain
in the $2 billion range, after the industry earned $2.2 billion
through the first three quarters of 1995. 
     The gain in 1995 follows five years of losses that totalled $13
billion.
     Passenger load factor increased to a post World War II record of
67%.
     Airline fatalities fell from 171 in 1994 to 166 among major U.S.
airlines in 1995. There were only two major crashes in 1995 versus
three in 1994. Among U.S. commuter and regional carriers, there were
two accidents with nine fatalities in 1995, versus three with 88
deaths the year earlier.
     "Airlines need to repair their balance sheets, buy new aircraft
and get ready for the 21st century," said ATA President Carol Hallett.
     She added that the outlook for 1996 is "hopeful," as long as the
economy remains strong, airline employees and management cooperate on
work rules, and "if the government tax collector keeps his hand out of
the industry's pocket."
     Hallett also reiterated that airlines need a continued exemption
from the planned additional 4.3 cent-per-gallon federal fuel tax.

WORLD AIRLINE TRAFFIC GREW 7% IN 1995, ICAO ESTIMATES

     Preliminary estimates for 1995 show that the world's airlines
carried more than 1.3 billion passengers in 1995, up 5% over the 1.23
billion carried in 1994, the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) reports. ICAO estimates that airlines flew 2.2 trillion revenue
passenger kilometers (RPKs) in 1995, an increase of 7% over the 2.1
trillion flown in 1994.
     Capacity, based on available seat kilometers (ASKs), is estimated
to have risen 6% to 3.3 trillion, and average passenger load factor
was expected to rise one point to 67% worldwide. In addition, ICAO
estimates 21.6 million tons of freight were transported last year, up
8% over 1994. The data indicate a continuing recovery of the world
airline economy and the likelihood of record traffic growth in 1996.
     Internationally, passenger traffic rose 8%, ICAO estimates, to
1.2 trillion RPKs, up from the 1.1 trillion flown in 1994. Available
capacity in ASKs will have risen slightly less than traffic growth, 7%
-- totaling 1.8 trillion, meaning that average load factors on
international routes also increased by approximately one point, to
68%.
     International passenger boardings are expected to have risen 5%,
to 360 million boardings, up from the 344 million recorded in 1994.
ICAO says international freight tons carried will have risen 8% to
12.7 million tons in 1995 from the 11.8 million tons recorded last
year.

ESTONIA IN THE MIDST OF PRIVATIZING ITS NATIONAL CARRIER

     The national airline of Estonia is being privatized, as the
country's privatization agency is selling 66% of Estonian Air equity
to private bidders. The offering will cease Jan. 25, and the airline
would keep its status as a national carrier. Estonian Air operated a
fleet of only Russian-built Tupolev aircraft until it leased a new
737-500 from ILFC in 1995. The airline, which flies to Frankfurt,
Moscow and Stockholm, will acquire a second 737 as well. A study by
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ranks Estonia as
high as Hungary and the Czech Republic in terms of privatization,
reports Deutsche Presse. About 65% of Estonia's gross domestic product
is owned by the private sector.

U.S. AIRLINE NOVEMBER TRAFFIC UPDATE 

     U.S. airlines generally continued to improve load factors, even
with slow traffic gains, in November. For 10 major carriers, traffic
rose 1.6% over November 1995, while capacity actually decreased 0.3%.
The positive trend for the 11 months through November was almost as
strong, with revenue passenger miles rising 1.3% faster than a modest
boost in available seat miles.
     The Alaska Air Group showed a welcome positive switch in
November: RPMs up 13.3% versus an ASM increase of only 5.8%. For most
of 1995, Alaska's traffic increase lagged the big increase in capacity
the carrier sought to secure its market presence.
     America West's traffic gains doubled capacity growth in November.
The carrier has big expansion plans now, little more than a year and a
half after emerging from Chapter 11. The good news for Continental
since spring continued in November: big capacity cuts, mostly on
unprofitable routes, matched by smaller traffic losses and rising
yield. 
     Southwest Airlines is still looking for traffic increases to
match its expanded capacity. The carrier continued to make gains in
1995, but November did not witness the "convergence" of traffic and
capacity trends some Southwest boosters had been hoping for.

U.S. AIRLINES PICK UP $13.15 BILLION ON MARKETS IN '95

     On Wall Street, 1995 was the year airlines hoped 1994 would be.
It may also have been the year some airlines decided what they really
wanted to be. Proportionally, the two biggest gainers were a low-fare
startup and a veteran major that dropped its own low-fare operation.
ValuJet Airlines and Continental Airlines picked up more than 350% in
share value in 1995.
     Two recovering airlines, Northwest and USAir, saw their stock
prices triple last year. A mix of new and old airlines doubled share
prices, from the modest Frontier to the giant United Airlines. More
moderate but still welcome increases were posted by American Airlines'
parent AMR Corp. and Delta Air Lines.
     Southwest Airlines, the big loser on 1994 stock markets,
recovered 37% of its share price.
     Despite lagging the high-flyers in 1994, AMR's past strength
enabled it to remain the most valuable U.S. airline franchise - at
least according to the market's guess. AMR equity was worth $5.64
billion Dec. 29.
     Federal Express and Delta slipped a notch in the ranking, as
Northwest's gains puts it second, at $4.30 billion. United's climb
sharply in 1995, but the second largest airline in the world was still
only seventh in U.S. market value at year-end. A late-December drop of
nearly 15% in UAL Corp. share prices did not help.
     Overall, 17 publicly traded airline companies gained $13.15
billion during the year, nearly doubling their market value. Only two
of the 17 companies lost market value during the year, and this news
was not really bad. Western Pacific Airlines' shares dropped after a
Dec. 5 public offering - but the carrier had not even existed in 1994.
It would surely not have gone public if 1995's climate did not prove
not so favorable. Hawaiian Airlines did fly in 1994 - under Chapter 11
protection. Its recovery in 1995 was choppy but, by year-end, Hawaiian
had new capital and time to improve some more.
     At the start of 1995, Trans World Airlines' survival was a major
industry question. By Dec. 29, TWA's new shares rose 66% from its
August value, just after a pre-packaged Chapter 11.

BRIEFS

     Airbus Industrie reports that 1995 sales reached a record $9.6
billion, as 124 aircraft were delivered to 30 customers. The increase
stems from a higher percentage of widebodies delivered - 49 A330/A340s
vs. 34 in 1994. Deliveries included 56 A320/A321s and 19 A300/A310s.
Airbus' 1995 orders totalled only 106, which the aircraft maker values
at $7 billion. New customers include Midway, TACA of Costa Rica, Aer
Lingus, Yemenia-Yemen Airways and Air Jamaica. At the end of 1995,
Airbus had an order backlog of 578 aircraft that it says is worth
$46.4 billion. Total Airbus orders to date are 1,935, with 1,357
aircraft delivered.

     Midwest Express Holdings, which operates Midwest Express
Airlines, has authorized the repurchase of up to $5 million of the
company's outstanding common stock. The airline had 6.4 million shares
of common stock outstanding as of Nov. 30. The purchased stock will be
held in the company's treasury until issued in connection with
employee and director benefit or option plans or for other general
corporate purposes.

     Qatar Airways, which operates three 727-200s and two 747-SR-81s,
plans to add one of each aircraft type to its fleet early this year.
Some reports have hinted that the airline may be privatized in 1996.

     Montreal-based Royal Airlines has leased an Airbus A320-200 from
Fortis Aviation. The lease is only for four months, covering the
winter season for Royal. It is the first A320 for the airline, which
operates Lockheed L1011 and Boeing 727 jets. UK-based Fortis says it
was given an exclusive mandate by the airline in mid-September to
acquire an A320 by early December. The A320 found was turned in to
GATX off lease from Excalibur Airways of the UK. Following a C check,
the aircraft was delivered Dec. 15.
 
     Southwest Airlines seems to have gambled and won in Las Vegas.
Bill Owen, schedule planner for the airline, says Las Vegas is "just a
bottomless pit for making money," and notes that the city is growing
rapidly for the airline. Southwest now has the greatest number of
departures from Las Vegas.  

     All Nippon Airways has chosen International Aero Engines to power
its fleet of Airbus A321s, 10 of which are on firm order. ANA also
chose Pratt & Whitney for Boeing 777-300 powerplants. Both aircraft
will enter ANA's fleet in 1998.

     ValuJet Airlines has started a new counter-to-counter small
package service between all 26 cities in the ValuJet system. The
airline says ValuJet Small Package (VSP) service is the only small
package service in the country which proactively tracks the movement
of each shipment. The VSP service features next-flight out shipping.

     Southwest Airlines can never be accused of being too serious. The
airline recently mailed a magazine to employees (and reporters)
featuring the colorful Southwest leadership. Among the photos were CEO
Herb Kelleher in a purple dress and flowered hat; CFO Gary Kelly with
a long hippie wig, sporting a two-fingered peace sign; Bill Miller, VP
Inflight Services, dressed as Mr. Clean; and Keith Taylor, VP Revenue
Management, featured as a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader, complete with
makeup and a brassiere. In the biographies, Kelleher disclosed that he
performed as a carrot in a second grade play and was invited to try
out for the Philadelphia Eagles pro football team.

IBERIA BAILOUT PROMPTS BRITISH AIRWAYS PROTEST

     Spain and the European Commission have reached agreement on a
proposal that would inject $713 million into state-owned Iberia Group,
parent of financially troubled Iberia Airlines. The move prompted an
immediate outcry from outgoing British Airways Chairman Sir Colin
Marshall, who indicated that BA may take legal action against the EC.
     European Commissioner of transport Neil Kinnock and Spanish
Industry Minister Juan Manuel Eguiaguaray reached agreement Dec. 14 on
the bail-out proposal. The European Union said the agreement calls for
the loan to be considered a market-compatible investment and "would
not therefore constitute state aid." The EU plans to make a formal
decision on the proposal in mid-January.
     Marshall, an opponent of state-aid to ailing carriers, said the
tranche of funds "astonished" the European airline industry. "The
[European] Commission's justification seems to be that the state aid
originally requested has somehow been miraculously transformed into an
investment," Marshall told the Royal Aeronautical Society Dec. 14, at
the annual Wilbur and Orville Wright lecture.
     "It is an amazing decision which further sets back the prospect
of truly fair competition in Europe," Marshall said. "It is sad to see
the Commission give in to political pressure. I find it extremely
difficult to see how the Commission could [conclude] that this is not
state aid."
     Marshall hopes the EC will distribute a report by consultants
Deloitte & Touche, commissioned by the EC to look into Iberia's
business plan. "We are ... considering our response [which] could
include legal action against Neil Kinnock's proposal," Marshall said.
"The practice of state aid makes a mockery of single market practices
and weighs heavily against British airlines."
     Under the EC proposal, the commission would "indicate its
willingness" to consider a request for an additional capital injection
of up to 20 billion pesetas [$164 million] in 1997 if Iberia achieves
"financial and other indicators" for 1995 and 1996, which would be
confirmed by independent accountants. 
     The European Union estimates that on the advice of its
consultants, "the minimum capital injection to meet immediate cash
requirements would be slightly more than 50 billion pesetas [$410
million]." However, it added, "a higher capital injection could be
considered to be feasible on commercial grounds."
     The EU, in approving an 87 billion-peseta initial tranche, took
into account annual profit growth of 4%; the cost of the new capital;
and proceeds from Iberia's interest in Aerolineas Argentinas.
     After the EU said last year it would not approve a bailout
without Iberia divesting its majority stake in Aerolineas Argentinas,
Iberia parent Teneo Group negotiated a sale of the Latin American
company to private investors.

KLM FILES SUIT AGAINST NORTHWEST CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS

     KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is suing the controlling directors of
Northwest Airlines, saying that last month's adoption of a "poison
pill" defense by Northwest was illegal and invalid. The suit says the
poison pill "was not to protect the Northwest stockholders from
hostile acquisitions, but to restrict KLM's ability" to exercise an
option it was granted two years ago to buy an additional 5% of
Northwest stock. KLM was granted an increase in ownership after it
made an emergency loan to Northwest for $50 million and helped arrange
for $200 million more.
     The complaint filed in a Delaware court seeks an order to set
aside or modify the "poison pill" on the grounds that Northwest's
action was "tainted with self-interest," since it was "advocated and
approved by a majority of directors who stood to gain financially if
KLM is prevented from exercising the option."

CONTINENTAL, TACA GROUP SIGN CODESHARING/MARKETING ALLIANCE

      Continental Airlines and the Taca Group of Central American
airlines, which compete in numerous U.S.-Central American markets,
will team up in a new marketing and codesharing alliance.
      The pact will provide for the Taca reservations code on
Continental flights between its Newark hub and Miami, Houston and
Dallas, as well as Houston and Los Angeles. Continental's two-letter
code will appear on selected Taca Group flights between Panama City
and several destinations including Guayaquil, Quito and Santo Domingo.
      The agreement will become effective June 1, this year, subject
to the approval of the U.S. government and El Salvador.
      The Taca Group consists of Taca International Airlines,
Aviateca, Copa, Lacsa and Nica.
      "Central America and the northern tier of South America are
important markets for Continental and are obviously the home markets
of the Taca Group carriers," says David Grizzle, vice president-
alliance development for Continental.
      "This alliance will increase the presence of Continental in each
of the markets we already serve, add some additional markets, and will
improve the Taca Group's reach into the U.S."
      Grizzle says Continental will benefit from increased schedule
convenience for passengers, improved through check-in and seat
selection, and OnePass frequent flyer mileage accrual opportunities on
Taca airlines. The frequent flyer cooperation is reciprocal, so Taca
passengers flying on Continental flights also will be able
to accrue Taca mileage.
      What was unclear last week is if Taca customers may also accrue 
mileage through LatinPass, the 15-airline frequent flyer program whose
chief founder is Taca Group Chairman Federico Bloch. A Continental
spokeswoman did not know if mileage could be transferred to LatinPass,
and officials at Taca, including Bloch, were unavailable at our press
time.

LUFTHANSA, SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS SIGN COOPERATIVE ALLIANCE

      The chairmen of Lufthansa and South African Airways (SAA) signed
a cooperative pact that cements the alliance between the German and
South African flag carriers. Cooperation between the two airlines will
center initially on codesharing flights from April, the inter-linking
of frequent flyer programs and cargo operations, Lufthansa says.
      Members of Lufthansa's "Miles & More" frequent flyer program and
SAA's "Voyager" program will have their miles pooled. Customers will
be able to transfer mileage between accounts.
      The airlines are also planning to introduce joint ground
handling services during the summer of this year or early in the
1996/97 winter season, as well as through-checking and joint use of
each other's airport lounges. Lufthansa says the two airlines will
begin offering on April 1 a total of 29 codesharing connections to
three destinations in Germany, Frankfurt, Munich and Duesseldorf, and
to two in South Africa, Johannesburg and Cape Town.
      Lufthansa also codeshares with United Airlines and Thai Airways
International. Lufthansa will operate seven flights a week between
Frankfurt and Johannesburg, while South African Airways will operate
six fights per week between the two airport hub cities.
      Lufthansa will operate three flights a week between Frankfurt
and Cape Town and SAA five flights. In addition, SAA will offer two
flights per week from both Duesseldorf and Munich to Cape Town and
also from Duesseldorf and Munich to Johannesburg.

MALAYSIA AIR CHAIRMAN SAYS VIRGIN ATLANTIC STILL CODESHARING

      Malaysia Airlines (MAL) last week denied that Virgin Atlantic
Airways is considering pulling out of its code-sharing arrangement
with the national carrier in the London-Kuala Lumpur-Australia market.
Executive Chairman Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli said, "We have not heard any
implication of that sort." Tajudin was responding to reports
suggesting that Virgin Atlantic would formally request dissolution of
the code-sharing arrangement.
      Under the agreement, MAL and Virgin operate 14 weekly
frequencies from Kuala Lumpur to London, and seven weekly frequencies
to Australia using MAL aircraft. "Mr. Branson is a gentleman. If he is
not satisfied over something, I am sure he would have told us about it
himself," Tajudin said. "In fact, he is in constant contact with us.
We're very happy with the (code-sharing) arrangement."
      The code-sharing agreement, which came into effect last May, was
considered a coup by Malaysia Airlines, because it enabled the carrier
to market to passengers needing to fly through London onto the
European continent, or the opposite way to North America. Malaysian
officials have so far been frustrated by long-running attempts to get
authority from Britain or France for rights to pick up local
passengers at London or Heathrow on long-haul flights from the Far
East.

TAIWANESE COMPANY PLANS PANAMANIAN AIRLINE

      A Taiwanese airline company plans to begin an intercontinental
airline in Panama, sources say. Evergreen Marine Corp., which founded
Eva Airways, will boost its involvement in Panama in part because of
the connections Evergreen Chairman Chang Jung-fa has with the
Panamanian government, sources tell Airline Marketing News. Chang was
named an investment adviser to Panamanian President Ernest Perez
Balladares last year.
      The airline is expected to begin international service from
Panama by July, the sources say. Equipment being considered for the
venture include 767 and 757 equipment from Boeing and A340 and A330
aircraft from Airbus Industrie.
      Eva has applied with Panamanian authorities to begin an airline
that will fly to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia, sources
say, adding that the airline has long-term plans to operate to the
U.S., Europe and Asia. Eva also has asked Panama's incumbent
international airline, copa, to become a minority shareholder, the
sources say, but has not yet received any response. The offer was made
in November.
      Eva Airways now operates long-haul service from Taipei to Los
Angeles and last year began linking that daily trip with Panama.

BUSINESS TRAVEL PRICES WILL RISE 3%-4% IN 1996, AMEX PREDICTS

    Airlines should benefit from an increase of 3%-4% in air travel
prices in 1996, according to a publication released by American
Express (Amex) in December. The publication, 1996 Trends & Forecasts
for the Business Travel Industry, suggests the increase is on top of a
5% increase in average fares from 1994 to 1995, suggesting a minor
slowdown in price increases.
    For 1995, typical business fares were estimated to have risen 3%,
based on data from the first three quarters of the year.) For October,
the latest full month in 1995 of actual booking data available, the
average fare paid by business travelers rose 12% higher than October
1994, based on corporate reservations booked through Amex in the 215
routes tracked by its "Airfare Index" for business travel. 
    In addition, full-coach fares rose 3% from October to November,
while the lowest discount fares fell by 1%. The lowest discount fare
level, however, is 14% higher compared to November 1994.
    Discount fares will be difficult for business travelers to find,
Amex says, suggesting that average full-coach fares will continue to
rise. Amex says load factors are forecast to reach a record high of
67% by the end of 1996. "There's no relief in sight for 1996," Amex
adds, "as passenger traffic is expected to outstrip supply growth,
bringing fares back to nearly 1993 levels."
    Electronic distribution will play a larger role in streamlining
business travel and reducing costs, Amex suggests. "Travel agencies,
airlines and computer reservations systems providers are introducing
tools this year that enable booking travel by e-mail or Internet, or
direct computer dial-up to reservations services," Amex says. "If not
booked through a corporate preferred agency, however, employees may
find themselves paying 15% to 20% more than corporate rates.
    "These tools," Amex says, "along with electronic expense reporting
software, are expected to reduce the administrative burden on
travelers, and streamline accounting and data management associated
with travel."
    The publication estimates that the average company spends 43% of
its travel and entertainment budget on air fares, with 21% on lodging,
8% on car rentals, 25% on meals and 3% on miscellaneous expenses. Amex
believes U.S. companies spent approximately $140 billion on travel and
entertainment in 1995.

DELTA TO CRS VENDORS: LOWER FEES TO REDUCE DISTRIBUTION COSTS

    Delta Air Lines issued a plea to computer reservations system
vendors to help it reduce distribution costs incurred through agents'
booking practices.
    Since the option of electronic ticketing is rapidly becoming the
industry norm, "CRSs will be forced to offer product distribution for
lower participation fees, and the more efficient CRSs will have an
advantage over other systems," says Robert Coggin, executive vice
president-marketing for Delta.
    A recent rate increase will bring Delta's CRS distribution costs
to $250 million annually, the airline claims. "Continued rate
increases and other CRS marketing practices, such as productivity
pricing, which encourage abuse, will only encourage Delta and other
carriers to implement practices designed to minimize or eliminate the
distribution of their product through CRSs."
    Airlines have been increasingly concerned about "productivity
pricing," which offers substantial bonuses to travel agents who book a
certain number of segments in a given period on one airline. The
practice, airlines claim, encourage agents to make large numbers of
false bookings.
    "We are at a critical juncture in our effort to determine the most
cost-effective means of distributing our product," Coggin says. "While
Delta has long supported CRS distribution, we cannot support an
inefficient system which relies on increasing participant charges as
its primary source of revenues." Coggins says that if Delta cannot
reduce distribution costs "through dialogue," it will have no choice
but to find other avenues "that might be available to us." Coggin did
not say what those avenues might be.

ATLANTA-BASED NEW-START INDEPENDENCE AIR GETS NEW PRESIDENT

    Independence Air, the potential new-entrant airline that wants to
begin widebody transcontinental service using Airbus aircraft, has
named a new president whose goal is to begin service by the second
quarter of this year. Roy Hagerty, a 25-year industry veteran,
replaces Barry Harris, a former acting administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration, who decided to return to his consulting
business in Washington after less than two months with the fledgling
firm.
    It was the second such leadership change at Independence Air.
Before Harris, the Department of Transportation indicated to the
company that the appointment of Stephen Quinto, one of the airline's
founders, would be inappropriate due to the bankruptcy of his last
airline, Northeastern, in 1982.
    Hagerty, who most recently served as president of Airline
Development Group, a consulting firm based in Raleigh, N.C., says the
company needs some $6 million in startup funds to get off the ground.
The company is still looking at Airbus A300B4 aircraft, which can
carry some 270 passengers depending on configuration, but also is a
good cargo aircraft.
    Before his job at Airline Development Group, Hagerty was chairman,
president and CEO of CCAIR, Inc., a U.S. regional airline that
operated as Piedmont Commuter and later USAir Express. Hagerty grew
the business from a money-losing effort in 1983 to a $60 million firm
that reported profits of $4 million in 1991. Before CCAir, Hagerty ran
Coastal Air, which operated Southeastern Airlines, from 1972 to 1983.
    Hagerty told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week that he
plans to hire several former Eastern Airlines officials who had
recently left Independence Air after Harris resigned.

DELTA, AMERICAN EXPRESS LAUNCH CO-BRANDED CREDIT CARD

    Delta Air Lines and American Express said Jan. 4 they are
launching a cobranded credit card that awards Delta frequent flyers
one mile for each dollar charged. The Delta miles will never expire.
In addition, Delta offers 1.5 SkyMiles for purchases of Delta and
Delta Connection tickets using the card, as well as for Delta Dream
Vacations.
    The card has an initial annual percentage rate of 8.9% for the
first six months of membership. After that the rate for purchases is
prime plus 9.4%, which under today's rates would equal 17.9%. Interest
rate for cash advances is prime plus 12.9%.
    Annual fee is $55, which is being waived for primary American
Express personal, Gold and Platinum cardmembers. Annual cap on
SkyMiles accumulation is $60,000 in charges, except for the bonus for
Delta purchases, which has no cap.

AMERICAN UNVEILS EXPANDED CORPORATE CARD PROGRAM

    American Airlines unveiled Jan. 9 a new corporate travel program
that includes a new MasterCard corporate charge card.
    The new card is being combined with the Air Travel Card, which has
been used by corporate travel departments to help manage air travel
expenses. "The combined strength of the new AAsset Card and the Air
Travel Card," says Mike Gunn, American's senior vice president-
marketing, "delivers a comprehensive billing and payment system to
better manage all of a company's business travel expenses."
    GE Capital Financial Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of GE
Capital, is issuer of the new card. The card features American's "AA"
logo along with the Air Travel Card symbol and the MasterCard logo. It
also doubles as a long-distance calling card.

FORMER KIWI EXECS FORM CONSULTING GROUP FOR START-UPS

    Prospective new-entrant airlines may find a friend in former Kiwi
International Airlines CEO Robert Iverson. Iverson and several of his
colleagues have formed a consulting group to help startup carriers get
off the ground. Turn Key Aviation Co. was formed in response to
interest airline executives had for Iverson's Kiwi start-up blueprint,
he says.
    Marketing is one of the key ingredients to key success for a new-
start airline, and Iverson tells Airline Marketing News that he tries
to "focus people on those marketing ideas and opportunities specific
to the startup environment." New-start executives waste a great deal
of money, he claims, on marketing programs tailored to major airlines
that don't apply to new entrants. "Marketing dollars are extremely
scarce for skimpily-funded airlines," he says. "Very often, there's
such a lack of marketing expertise with small airlines that they will
run to something that seems very sexy to the public, not realizing
what effects it will have on them."
    One of those areas is loyalty programs. Iverson warns new entrants
not to be lured into frequent flyer alliances with major airlines that
bring with them large per-passenger expenses. "Try to take a close
look at what your non-cash resources do for you in customer loyalty,"
he says. "Unfilled seats are one of those resources."
    As an example, he suggests that a new-entrant carrier offer one
free roundtrip for every five roundtrips. "You reward the customer for
frequency and make it simple for the airline," Iverson says.
    Iverson also advises airlines to shy away from large computer
reservations systems for distribution purposes. "Our feeling is,
looking at successes such as Western Pacific and ValuJet," he says,
"comes very definitely down on the side of an in-house, proprietary
reservations and yield management system. I think they allow
tremendous flexibility in the control of an airline's inventory."
    Citing Western Pacific as one of the most successful startups to
utilize good internal yield management, Iverson says, "Our
understanding is that they have the ability to almost instantaneously
reallocate fares and availability to maximize yields."
    An in-house system also allows an airline to much more easily
maximize revenues, and he cautioned against taking too much of a
simplistic approach to pricing. "Kiwi and UltrAir thought it would be
a wonderful idea for a single price, unrestricted ticketing scheme,"
Iverson recalls. "What wound up happening is that they turned over
their inventory to the major carriers, because all they [major
carriers] had to do was lower their fares in one of their `buckets,'"
a term used in the airline industry to describe a category of
restricted fares.
    "Kiwi ultimately had to approach it from a much more traditional
yield management system," Iverson says. Instead of buying an off-the-
shelf system, however, Iverson says the carrier "tried to do it
piecemeal." It hired individuals with yield management expertise from
other airlines "and then tried to meld it into the Kiwi process."
    It was not an easy cultural change to make, Iverson recalls, after
Kiwi reservations and sales employees had become accustomed to a
simplified pricing scheme. "When multi-tiered ticketing and
restrictions popped up," he says, "it was not accepted by the staff.
We had to show we were losing a significant amount of money per seat.
Then people started buying into it."
    Advertising and external promotions also are a critical element of
short-term success, Iverson says. He notes that ValuJet spent nearly
half of its startup capital of $3 million on advertising and related
promotions. "Southwest Airlines," he says, "spends something like 80%
of its annual advertising budget for a new market in the first couple
of months of a new service." For a three-aircraft startup, he
suggested a figure of some $1 million per year.
    He also advises startups to "take a non-traditional look at how to
get your name out to the public." Use innovative public relations to
maximize your free publicity. Southwest, ValuJet, Air South and
Western Pacific are all good examples of innovative publicity yielding
benefits nearly equal to that spent on advertising and sales
promotions.
    Sussex, New Jersey-based Turn Key says it is currently is working
with three start-up carriers that expect to launch service this year.
"Our group is different from other consulting concerns in that we have
arranged for sources of financing, have aircraft ready to be put on a
certificate and have a marketing and public relations team that made
Kiwi a household name," Iverson says.

MARKETING BRIEFS

    * Gulfstream International Airlines, the Florida-based U.S.
regional carrier, is introducing the "Sun Pak" ticket booklet this
month. It allows business travelers to purchase a ticket booklet for
10 or 20 one-way trips between selected Gulfstream city pairs. No
advanced reservations are required, and there are no cancellation
penalties.
    * Inflight amenity kits supplied by Wessco International for Delta
Air Lines passengers in first and business classes won a "Diamond"
award from Onboard Services magazine (see photo at right).
    The awards are presented annually to recognize outstanding and
innovative new programs or concepts to enhance passenger service and
safety.
    The Delta kits, designed by Wessco Vice President Anne Gittelson,
feature a small carrying pack, a document holder, a tie or scarf case
and a compact disc case in black leatherette. A fitness book describes

YIELD MANAGEMENT/RESEERVATIONS

    * Cardinal Airlines, Caribair and Dolphin Express Airlines are now
using mainframe hosting and technical services from Worldspan Travel
Information Services, a computer reservations system company, based in
Atlanta. Worldspan was formed when Delta's Datas II CRS and TWA's
system, which was called PARS. The two merged in the late 1980s to
form Worldspan.
    * ValuJet, the Atlanta-based DC-9 airline that started service on
Oct. 26, 1993, will open its third reservations center in Newport
News, Va., in February. The center will initially employ 200 with
eventual plans for 450. ValuJet awarded a contract to TAD Aviation
Services to staff and manage the center. It will operate the same
hours as existing centers in Atlanta and Savannah, Ga. -- 5 a.m. to 1
a.m. East Coast time.
    * Worldspan named a new chief financial officer. Samuel D. Horgan
replaces former CFO Mark S. Mulvany, who is retiring this month.
Horgan was previously CFO for Buffalo, N.Y.-based Computer Task Group
(CTG), a New York Stock Exchange information technology services
company.
    * United Airlines has completed programming and testing for its
participation in Worldspan's "Airline Source," which allows Worldspan
travel agents to directly access United's seat inventory and true
last-seat availability according to class of service. Agents receive
immediate acknowledgement of booking.
    * Covia Technologies, part of the Galileo International group that
operates the Apollo computer reservations system, sold its Distributed
Applications Products and Services business to Siemens Nixdorf
Information Systems of Burlington, Mass. The Covia unit joining
Siemens Nixdorf provides software and consulting services to airlines
worldwide, such as Delta Air Lines, Eva Air of Taiwan and Japan
Airlines.
    * Sabre Travel Information Network has begun offering electronic
ticketing to United Airlines passengers. With travel agents now able
to book United domestic tickets electronically through three of the
four major U.S. CRSs -- Sabre, Apollo and System One -- United's
electronic ticketing service is now available to the majority of
agents in the U.S. So far, however, Sabre has not yet developed an
electronic ticketing service for its sister airline subsidiary,
American Airlines.

AIR SOUTH TO START BUSINESS-CLASS SECTION; EXPANDS TO FLORIDA

    South Carolina-based start-up Air South will install a business-
class 'club' section in its aircraft, looking for an upgraded fare in
a low-cost market. The airline also will start new service to several
southern U.S. destinations, mostly in Florida.
    Air South Chief Financial Officer Tom Volz says the carrier will
charge $20 extra for an "up-front club section" seat. At the same
time, it will eliminate "lounge areas" it has had on its six Boeing
737s-200s. The airline has lowered costs from 14 cents per seat mile
when it first flew last year to about eight cents. It costs Air South
8.3 cents per seat mile to fly a 250-mile segment, Volz says.
    The airline is expanding southward, mostly to the new focus areas
of both Southwest Airlines and ValuJet Airlines: Florida. Air South
will soon start non-stop service from South Carolina to Atlanta,
Raleigh-Durham, Jacksonville and Myrtle Beach. New one-stops are
planned to Miami, Tallahassee and Tampa-St. Petersburg. 
    Air South executes a "hub-bypass strategy," says Volz, where the
airline, for example, will not fly through Atlanta unless we have to.
The airline also will go ticketless early in 1996 and expand into
larger markets, including Chicago, Florida, New York and Washington.
    "We have to be at least 11 units [aircraft] to realize advantages
of scale," says Volz, pointing to the carrier's need for five more
737s.
    Volz also says Air South, which received substantial assistance
from the state of South Carolina, has put $12 million back into the
state's economy in the past year.

CANADIAN PLANS BUSINESS-CLASS UPGRADE IN 737 FLEET

    Canadian Airlines International, having finished a sweeping
upgrade of business-class service in international markets last year,
is now focusing attention on its narrowbody fleet. The first segment
of the fleet to get upgraded business class sections will be the 737s,
37 of which are flown by Canadian.
    The 737s will be reconfigured and outfitted with 12 wider
business-class seats. The new seats will replace 20 economy-class
seats. In addition, the pitch between each of the 88 remaining coach
seats will be lengthened by an inch, to 34 inches. Pitch for business
class will be 39 inches.
    Gregg Saretsky, vice president-passenger marketing for Canadian,
says the move is partially prompted by last year's "open skies" U.S.-
Canada air services agreement, which opened up transborder services to
a variety of new markets and new entrants. "The bar has been raised to
maintain a superior business class on shorter-haul routes," he says.
    The reconfiguration program begins Jan. 28. One 737 per day will
be reconfigured through March 3.

BRITISH AIR SUBSIDIARY TO OFFER 25% INCREASE IN CLUB EUROPE SEATING

    British Airways' subsidiary in Europe, GB Airways, will increase
Club Europe business-class seating by 25% on most of its fleet of 737-
400 narrowbody aircraft. The change will bring a total of 36 Club
Europe seats in -400 aircraft. The fleet will be reconfigured by the
end of March. The increase in Club Europe seating is due to strong
demand in Club Europe cabins on flights to Spain, Tunisia and Morocco.
    "Demand remains buoyant, mainly as a result of the steadily
improving economy in Europe," says Peter Kenworthy, GB Airways general
manager-commercial, "and as more British companies look at the
investment opportunities in North Africa."

AVIATION TAXES LAPSE; TRUST FUND REVENUES DEPENDENT ON BUDGET DEAL

The revenue stream supporting the aviation trust fund halted Monday as
various aviation excise taxes lapsed because of the continued impasse
between Congress and the White House over a balanced budget. The expired
taxes are the 10% airline passenger ticket tax, the 6.25% cargo waybill
tax, the $6 international departure tax and the 17.5 center-per-gallon non-
commercial aviation fuel tax. A seven-year balanced budget vetoed by
President Clinton last month would have extended the excise taxes through
Sept. 30, 1996.
   Without the taxes, the only significant revenue flowing into the
aviation trust fund is the interest on the trust fund balance. In a
discussion with reporters last month, FAA Deputy Administrator Linda
Daschle said the uncommitted balance in the trust fund could be depleted in
eight or nine months if taxes do not resume. White House officials and
congressional leaders have continued to negotiate over a budget deal
throughout much of the holiday season and will resume talks this week.
Since Congress already has given FAA authority to obligate funds, including
Airport Improvement Program grants, for fiscal 1996, FAA spending should
not be affected by the tax expiration.

DOT UPHOLDS MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF LOS ANGELES LANDING FEES

   DOT late last month found 81.5% of disputed fees at Los Angeles
International Airport reasonable, ordering a reduction in the landing fee
to $1.68 from $2.06 per thousand pounds landed weight, and a refund of
approximately $5 million to the airlines. The decision differs from the
November recommended decision by DOT Administrative Law Judge Burton Kolko
on the issue of police department expenses. Contrary to Kolko's ruling,
DOT allowed for most of the police expenses sought by the city. However,
DOT kept with Kolko's decision to exclude charges sought for police work
beyond the airport's boundary.
   Kolko recommended that over the course of a year, the airlines were due
just over $7 million in refunds from the airport - representing 14 cents of
the disputed fee. Under DOT's decision, the city will have to refund or
credit airlines only nine cents per thousand pounds landed weight in fees
it found to be unreasonable.
   Under an existing agreement with the airlines, 29 cents of the disputed
fees relating to costs for airfield land valuation are collected and placed
in escrow pending litigation stemming from a June 30 DOT rates and charges
decision. Los Angeles will adjust the landing fee to $1.97, said John
Driscoll, executive director of the Department of Airports. Roughly $1.3
million will be returned to the airlines for collected fees allocated to
fire engine company costs. DOT did not prevent the city, however, from
later making a new allocation of the fire unit's cost when it reconciles
the airport's actual versus budgeted expenses.
   DOT disagreed with Kolko's decision that police expenses should be
bourne by the community, Driscoll noted. Rather, DOT said that those
expenses should be shared in part by the airlines and other airport revenue
sources, he said. "That was a big win for all of the airports in this
country. Had the judge's decision prevailed, it would have been a disaster
for airports across the country," Driscoll said. "Even with today's
decision, LAX's current landing fee is significantly lower than many other
U.S. international gateways." Driscoll said that the judge "upheld our
right to charge the airlines our legal fees in defending ourselves in these
lawsuits they have brought against us and lost. As a result, not one
dollar of taxpayer money will be used to pay legal costs."
   "Today's decision pays lip service to the congressional mandate
prohibiting cities, like Los Angeles, from diverting airport revenues to
pay for general public services," Air Transport Association President Carol
Hallett said. "We are left with no choice but to go back to Congress for
the second time in three years to get this mess cleaned up." Hallett said
that the increased landing fees are "nothing more than hidden taxes" for
Los Angeles area citizens. "The airport has nearly $1 billion in retained
earnings, and city hall projected a $50 million surplus for the current
fiscal year. You tell me who is kidding whom," she said.

JOHNSON CONTROLS WINS ATLANTIC CITY MANAGEMENT CONTRACT

   Johnson Controls Inc., Teterboro, N.J., was selected to operate Atlantic
City International Airport in a public/private partnership with South
Jersey Transportation Authority. According to authority Chairman Stanley
Glassey, Johnson Controls was selected from the final four firms vying for
the contract because it offered the best chance of minimizing airport
operating costs while the maximizing revenue stream (AIRPORTS, Dec. 5,
1995). In its proposal, the firm agreed to pay an independent company to
conduct appraisals of its performance. SJTA said a plan for automated
maintenance, data collection and management systems as well as demonstrated
affiliations with airlines and cargo carriers were key factors to the
firm's selection.
   The firm has a use and occupancy agreement at the airport set to expire
March 31. Once final negotiations are complete, this month Johnson
Controls will be awarded a five-year operations, maintenance and support-
services contract to begin April 1. A $8.4 million terminal expansion to
include the addition of a second level and passenger loading bridges also
will be completed that month. If for some reason a final agreement with
Johnson Controls is not reached, SJTA said it will begin negotiations with
Serco Corp. of Gibbsboro, N.J. despite the firm's "limited and only recent
experience operating civilian airports."
   "The new arrangement with Johnson Controls will be completely different
from what we have today," said SJTA Executive Director James Crawford. 
"Unlike the existing situation, Johnson Controls will be working for us,
and answering to us. The authority will make the critical management
decisions while providing incentives for Johnson Controls to minimize
expenses and increase revenue." Under terms of the agreement, the
authority will be able to control aviation rates, air service policy and
airline use agreements. AMR Services Corp., Fort Worth, Texas and Airport
Group International, Glendale, Calif., were also in contention for the
contract.

VIGGO BUTLER LEAVES AIRPORT GROUP INTERNATIONAL

   Airport Group International (AGI), Glendale, Calif. (formerly Lockheed
Air Terminal) said late last month that Viggo Butler, president and chief
executive officer, was leaving the company. Bob Aaronson, executive VP and
general manager, has assumed the role of chief executive on an interim
basis, and a permanent chief executive is expected to be named soon, the
company said. Butler, who will remain available to AGI as a consultant,
joined Lockheed Air Terminal in 1973 and became president in 1984. He also
was a VP of Lockheed Corporation from 1990 until a new ownership structure
was completed in 1995 (AIRPORTS, March 7).

ICAO ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS RETAINING CURRENT NOISE LIMITS

   International Civil Aviation Organization's Committee on Aviation
Environmental Protection (CAEP/3) asked ICAO to retain its current
international aircraft noise limits "for the time being," the International
Air Transport Association said. IATA was in attendance of the CAEP/3
meetings held in Montreal last month as an observer. Additionally, any
"definitive decision on any changes" in limits of nitrogen oxides have been
referred to a mid-1996 meeting of the ICAO Council, IATA said.
   "IATA's policy is that there is no justification, on environmental,
technical or economic grounds, to increase stringency, at this time. But
the phase-out of older, less efficient aircraft and investment in equipment
embodying the latest technology to minimize noise and emissions," IATA
Director General Pierre Jeanniot said. "Changes to the Annex 16 noise
limits would have reduced the value of commercial aircraft in service and
therefore interfered with this fleet replacement process."

EC TO REVIEW LANDING CHARGES, AIRCRAFT FUEL TAX EXEMPTION

   The European Commission (EC) will review current tax exemptions applying
to aircraft fuel and to propose new rules on landing charges, according to
a discussion paper recently proposed by European Union Transport
Commissioner Neil Kinnock. The commission's green paper on "internalizing
external costs" in the transport sector pleads for more "efficient"
transport pricing - i.e. a system that reflects the "true costs" of
congestion, noise, pollution and accidents. The document mainly focuses on
road vehicles, but also announces some measures regarding air transport.
   In the first half of this year, the EC plans to propose a system of
"differentiated landing charges based on noise emissions." An example of
this approach is the introduction of differentiated port charges for
segregated ballast tankers, which are safer and more environmentally
friendly. The commission nevertheless admitted that "complicated aspects
of extra-community competition play a role in aviation and maritime
shipping." The tax exemption for aircraft fuels, "which could lead to a
distortion in transport choices," will be reviewed in the second half of
1996, the commission said.

TRANSPORT CANADA STRIKES AGREEMENTS ON TORONTO, WINNIPEG AIRPORT TRANSFERS

   Transport Canada last month said it had reached "common understandings"
with the airport authorities set up to operate Toronto and Winnipeg
airports, thus setting principal financial issues surrounding the transfer
of the airports to local control. A final agreement to transfer Toronto
Pearson International to the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA)
under a 60-year lease could be signed early this year, and operational and
managerial control could be transferred to GTAA in about six months.
Transport Canada said it expects to complete negotiations with the Winnipeg
Airports Authority early this year, allowing for transfer of control by
late summer or early fall. Separately, Transport Canada announced last
month that Flin Flon, Manitoba, Airport has officially been transferred to
the City of Flin Flon.
   Sidney Valo, chairman of the non-profit GTAA, says the agreement will
create an environment "for the GTAA to move forward aggressive with its
plans to develop Pearson as the international gateway to North America."
Valo forsees a 130-gate terminal replacing Terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson,
starting in four to six years, to be built in phases by the private sector
over 20 years at an estimated cost of $2 billion (Canadian). The new
terminal, capable of accommodating up to 50 million passengers a year,
would be linked to the existing Terminal 3. A Canadian Senate committee
last month concluded that Prime Minister Jean Chretien's controversial
termination of a previous government's legal deal to privatize and
redevelop Pearson was wrong (AIRPORTS, December 19).

TRANSPORT CANADA CITES 55 SAFETY ISSUES AT TORONTO PEARSON

   The first comprehensive audit of safety procedures at Toronto Pearson
International Airport in 10 years revealed 55 potential safety problems,
Transport Canada said. General Manager Lloyd McCoomb said that airport
operations are "very safe" and noted that some of the flaws identified in
the 84-page report have been corrected, notably procedural and training
issues. Based on inspections of ground operations in March, a 14-member
Transport Canada team that authored the report noted that, among other
things, aircraft movements on the aprons were inadequately monitored or
controlled, emergency crew response times were 10 seconds slower than the
international standard required on one of three runways, aircraft and
vehicles were straying on to runways from manuevering areas, congestion at
apron areas could delay emergency responses, the airport lacked a
firefighting training facility and the airport's safety plan is outdated.

BELGIAN COURT RULES FOR LUFTHANSA IN GROUND-HANDLING ISSUE AT ZAVEMTEM

   Lufthansa Airport Services Brussels, a ground-handling subsidiary of the
German airline, has won the right to serve Lauda Air passengers at Brussels
Zaventem Airport. The Brussels Court of Appeal ruled for Lufthansa against
the Belgian Aviation Authority and ground-handling company Belgavia, which
Lufthansa accused of abusing their dominant position as they prevented it
from operating at Brussels. The court ruled that a partial exclusivity
agreement between BAA and Belgavia violates European Union competition law.
The dispute, dating from March 1994, followed Lufthansa's purchase of a
39.7% stake in Lauda Air.

LINK TO PART 150 PROGRAM COULD ALLOW AIP FUNDING FOR PART 161 STUDIES

   If an airport can tie its Part 161 study to its Part 150 program, it is
possible to receive Airport Improvement Program funds, FAA said recently.
FAA's Part 161 regulations, mandated by the 1990 noise act, set out notice
and review requirements for new local Stage 2 restrictions and notice,
review and approval requirements for Stage 3 restrictions.
   "This is a recent determination and to date we have not funded any Part
161 study," Cynthia Rich, FAA associate administrator for airports, told
officials at Pease Development Authority (PDA) in a letter last month. "We
believe Part 161 studies must be tied to FAR Part 150 to be eligible for
AIP." This can be done it two ways, Rich explained. For one, the Part 161
study can be a part of the scope of work of a Part 150 study and funded as
airport noise compatibility planning. Second, the Part 161 study could be
a recommended measure in a Part 150 program and approved by FAA as a noise
project.
   Rich said that Pease Development Authority may propose Part 161 funding
as a recommended measure in its Part 150 study which FAA is slated to
either approve or disapprove by Feb. 10. "A funding commitment cannot be
made until that process is concluded," Rich said. She further assured PDA
that receipt of AIP funds for the Part 161 study "will not have a
detrimental effect upon the future availability of FAA discretionary or
entitlement funds."
   "It is remarkably good news for airports throughout the country that the
FAA has changed its position and will now fund Part 161 studies," attorney
Peter Kirsch of Cutler & Stanfield said. He pointed out that in the past,
many airports have been concerned that initiating part 161 studies would
threaten other FAA funding.

NORTHWEST UNION OPPOSES POSSIBLE NEW MINNEAPOLIS-AREA AIRPORT

   Northwest's Machinists union unit last month voiced opposition to a
possible new airport to replace Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport, saying the
airline might consider moving to a less costly facility elsewhere
(AIRPORTS, June 14, 1994). "Moving the airport to a new location could put
our members' jobs at risk," said Marvin Sandrin, president of Machinists
District 143. Northwest might consider moving outside the state where
facilities are already available such as a closed Air Force base.
   "There are a number of attractive alternatives" the airline might
consider if it is forced to move its maintenance operations, Sandrin said,
adding that Machinists will oppose any airport move because of the
estimated $2 billion financial burden it would place on Northwest. "If it
has a negative financial impact on the company, it will have a negative
impact on our members - the same members who took wage and benefit
concessions the last time Northwest Airlines's balance sheet went into the
red."

ATA ESTIMATES AIRLINES' 1995 EARNINGS AT $2 BILLION

   U.S. scheduled airlines likely will earn a net profit of $2 billion for
1995, the Air Transport Association said in its yearend report. Carriers
earned $2.2 billion in the first three quarters of the year, and ATA
expects a break-even fourth quarter. The second best year for U.S.
carriers was 1988, when profits totaled $1.69 billion. The industry's last
profitable year was 1989, with earnings of meager $127.9 million.
   "After five long years of losses totaling $13 billion, airlines need
profits to repair balance sheets, buy new aircraft and get ready for the
21st century," said ATA President Carol Hallett. She noted that the
outlook for next year is hopeful, but said, "This financial performance
does nothing to change the industry's position that we need a continued
exemption for the federal fuel tax." For the year, the industry boarded
548 million passengers, a 3.7% increase over 1994 levels, according to
preliminary data. Total revenue passenger miles flown were up 4%, and the
average load factor hit a post-war record of 67%.

TWA ADOPTS 'POISON PILL' PROVISION TO BLOCK HOSTILE TAKEOVERS

   TWA said last month that the board of directors had adopted a
stockholder rights plan or "poison pill" designed to protect the company
against an unsolicited takeover. "We have simply put a poison pill in
place," an airline spokesman said, "This is not in response to any specific
takeover attempt that we know of," he added.
   Under the plan, if an outsider acquires up to 15% of the carrier's
voting stock, or initiates a tender exchange that would result in control
of 20% the company, then current stockholders would receive rights to
purchase company shares. "This is designed to keep anyone from taking over
the company without paying a huge premium, unless they work with the
board," the spokesman said.

MALAYSIA AIRLINES GIVES BOEING $4 BILLION ORDER, SHUTS OUT AIRBUS

      Malaysia Airlines, like much of the industry recently, made an
all-Boeing choice in its $4 billion aircraft order announced Jan. 9.
The carrier purchased fifteen 777-200s and -300s and ten 747-400s.
      The order was a major disappointment for Airbus Industrie,
which had hoped Malaysia would invest in its A330 and A340 family
of widebodies. MAL currently operates eight A330s.
      The airline, a Boeing customer for more than 27 years, also
took options on three 747-400s and two 777s. Deliveries begin in
1997 and continue through 2001.
      Rolls Royce won the engine maker order from Malaysia, its
second major order in Asia to power the 777. Singapore Airlines
chose Rolls-Royce in December to power its 34 777s on order. Pratt
& Whitney won the order for 747 engines worth $400 million to the
U.S. engine maker. 
      Boeing says the Malaysia decision confirms that the "777 is an
excellent airplane for operations into and out of the Asia-Pacific
region," says Ron Woodard, president of Boeing Commercial Airplane
Group.
      He adds that the 747-400 has demonstrated its suitability to
Asia-Pacific markets, since it enables convenient, non-stop service
to distant destinations. Malaysia currently operates 65 Boeing jets,
including 15 747s and 50 737s.

 BOEING CLAIMS MORE THAN 80% OF ASIAN AIRCRAFT ORDERS 

      Asia-Pacific carriers gave Boeing Commercial Aircraft 82% of
their orders for new aircraft in 1995, a lean year for orders
across most of the rest of the world. The manufacturer counted 346
firm orders in 1995, versus 106 for Airbus and 114 for McDonnell
Douglas.
    Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 36% of
Boeing's orders last year, versus 13% for Airbus and 11% for
Douglas.
    The 226 orders for Boeing aircraft were placed by 20 Asian
airlines, from giants like All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines to
Taiwan's U-Land. And lessors are taking up a little of the slack in
airline demand: Ansett Worldwide Aviation accounted for seven new
jet orders in 1995, mostly 737-300s.
    ANA and Singapore are helping Boeing into the 21st century, with
big orders for the 777 series. Asia-Pacific airlines accounted for
more than two-thirds of the 1995 orders for the 777-200 and -300. 
    Asian airlines also helped keep the old goods moving for Boeing.
Nearly half of the orders for the traditional 737-200 and 747-400
were placed by carriers in the region.                               
    In December, Singapore Airlines gave Boeing one of its largest
orders of the year for 34 777s and a 
747-400 freighter. China Airlines ordered six 737-800s with options
on nine additional aircraft in late December. Deliveries are
expected to begin in 1998 and the order is worth an estimated $750
million. China Airlines' 737s will be powered by CFM56-7 engines,
manufactured by CFMI, a joint venture between General Electric of
the United States and SNECMA of France. The aircraft will be used
on regional and domestic routes. 
    Boeing also posted new orders from Thai Airways for two 737-
400s, Korean Air for four 777-400s, Japan TransOcean for one 737-
400, Asiana for three 747-400s and Japan Airlines for 16 747-400s
and five 777-300s and one 767 in December. 
    The JAL order for 16 747-400s announced by Boeing in its monthly
wrap up of orders and deliveries is not new, says JAL spokesperson
Morris Simoncelli. "The 16 747s are all part of our original order
for 50 jumbo jets placed earlier in the decade," he says.  JAL
deferred delivery on a portion of order several years ago and is
now ready to come up with a delivery schedule. The airline is
operating 32 of 50 747-400s ordered and deferred delivery on the
remaining 18 aircraft, he says. Delivery schedules for the 18
aircraft are expected to be announced in the next few months,
Simoncelli says.
    Airbus Industrie launched 1996 with a surge of orders from three
customers. Philippine Airlines had by far the largest order of the
four -- 24 aircraft, including four long-range A340-300 widebodies,
8 A330-200 twin-engine widebodies, and 12 A320 narrowbody planes.
BWIA International Airways, Yemenia Airways and GATX Leasing also
logged new Airbus orders. 
    Delivery of PAL's Airbus aircraft begin in the second quarter of
1997, with nearly simultaneous delivery of the first A340 and A330.
The first A320 will be delivered in the third quarter of 1997. PAL
has an additional four A340s from a previous order, which will be
delivered to PAL at the end of 1996.
    The airline plans to use the new A340s to develop its long-haul
route system, including new nonstops to Europe and North America,
Airbus says. A330s will be used on high-density Asian services and
on medium-to-long range routes as far away as the Middle East.
    PAL is also expected to order eight Boeing 747-400s valued at
$2.7 billion, but Boeing Commercial Airplane Group  has yet to
confirm it. GE Aircraft Engines confirmed Jan. 5 it has received
orders totaling $700 million from PAL for the CF6-80C2 to power
eight 747-400s and a mix of CF6s and CMF56s to power the Airbus
aircraft.  
    The number of Airbus operators increased from 123 to 131 in
1995.
    McDonnell Douglas posted 114 orders totaling $4.3 billion in
1995, a significant improvement over 1994 figures where the U.S.
manufacturer logged only 23 new orders. Asian carriers Korean Air,
U-Land and EVA Air placed orders for narrowbody aircraft, the MD-80
and MD-90.

AIRBORNE FORGES PARTNERSHIP WITH VIETNAM POST

    Airborne Express  has forged a partnership with the Vietnam
Ministry of Postal and Telecommunications to provide express and
freight delivery domestically and to worldwide destinations. 
Airborne has been operating in Vietnam since the country's
liberalization in mid-1994 and has offices in Ho Chi Minh City and
Hanoi.  
    FedEx and UPS have similar arrangements with Vietnam, but
Airborne is the only firm licensed to offer express, air freight
and ocean freight, says Bruce Grout, vice president for Asia Pacific
operations. Airborne acts as a freight forwarder in Vietnam relying
on the lift of carriers such as Air Vietnam, Singapore Airlines,
Lufthansa and Cathay Pacific to handle its cargo. To date, it has
enough capacity, but Grout sees capacity tightening as multinational
business continues to grow in the region. Express products are
growing at the fastest, he says but air freight is climbing. "[Air
freight] will just take time to grow, as it did in China." 
    "As a country Vietnam is not all that important [to the cargo
industry]. But it becomes very important if you are doing business
in Southeast Asia," Grout says. "We are starting to see a lot of
business between Europe and Vietnam." Seventy percent of Airborne's
business is intra-Asian, but the international business is growing,
he says. Footware, namely its contract with Nike, is Airborne's
primary export. Grout expects to break even in Vietnam this year
and see a profit in 1997. "But who knows? I may surprise myself
this year," he says.

INDIAN CONGLOMERATE PLANS TO BUY MAJORITY STAKE IN MODILUFT

    National Energy Processing Company (NEPC), a large Indian-based
conglomerate, plans to buy a majority stake in Modiluft, India's
second largest domestic carrier. But it faces a fight from the
airline's chairman. Sixty percent of Modiluft is owned by the Modi
family while Lufthansa German Airlines owns the remainder.
    NEPC Chairman Ravi Prakash Khemka tells Asian Aviation News he
plans to buy 30 million of the 53 million (57%) shares to gain
control of the airline, but Modiluft Chairman S.K. Modi says the
transaction is not possible without an agreement with him. Modi
warned that he would begin legal proceedings against NEPC, should
the need arise, claiming only 29% of the airline's shares are
available in the open market. 
    NEPC Airlines, which operates seven Fokker 50s and two jet
aircraft, acquired another Indian carrier, Damania Airways, in May
1995, making it the country's largest domestic operator.

KIWI SIGNS INTERLINE AGREEMENT WITH VIETNAM, TURNS PURSUITS TO

    Tasmania-based Kiwi Air has signed an interline agreement with
Vietnam Airlines that allows Kiwi to block seats on Vietnam from
flights from Sydney to Europe and other points in Asia. Kiwi is
also negotiating with Korea's Asiana for a similar interline
agreement. Kiwi, which operates a Boeing 757 from secondary New
Zealand cities to Brisbane and Sydney, may add a second 757 next
April when flights to Honolulu commence. The airline also is looking
at introducing an Airbus A320 for New Zealand domestic flights.

ANSETT SET TO BEGIN JAKARTA SERVICE NEXT MONTH

    Ansett International is slated to begin service to Jakarta on
Feb. 12 from Sydney. The flight, initially operated with a Boeing
747-300, will continue on to Kuala Lumpur before returning to
Sydney. It is likely one the airline commences service to Seoul
mid-year, the 747-300 on the Jakarta route will be replaced with a
767-300, the first in the airline's fleet. 
    Ansett took delivery of its seventh 767-200 on Dec. 25. The
aircraft was purchased from Britannia Airlines. A major fleet re-
equipment decision is expected within the next three months which
may lead to a reduction in the number of aircraft types it
operates. Movement in that regard has already begun. It recently
scrapped three Fokker F28-1000s and intends to upgrade its F28-4000
fleet. Its Fokker 50s are being withdrawn from the Sydney-Canberra
route, replacing them with Saab 340s.

SINGAPORE AIRLINES PLANS AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION IN LEASING

    Singapore Airlines' leasing subsidiary plans to boost its
worldwide presence by acquiring a fleet of up to 30 new-generation
aircraft. "We will grow by supplying airlines on competitive terms
with the aircraft they requires, says Singapore Aircraft Leasing
Enterprise (SALE) Chairman Matthew Samuel tells Asian Aviation News.
"Building constructive long-term relationships with our airlines
customers is the key element in this strategy." 
    SALE plans to raise its capital from US$60 million to US$250
million as it expands operations. 
    The company currently has four aircraft on lease. The firm has
two Boeing 767-300ER and six 777-300s on order with options for
another 10 on the later. SALE recently took delivery of one 767-300
ER and leased it to Alitalia Airlines. The remaining 767s are to be
delivered in June.
     Samuel says that although SALE's current focus is on acquiring
wide-bodied aircraft, the company may opt for smaller aircraft on a
selected basis.

    Malaysia Airports Berhad (MAB) Managing Director Khairuddin bin
Ibrahim says the company hopes to use the experience gained from
managing Malaysia's 36-airport system to assist airports in other
countries. 
    The company already has a contract to manage Pochentong
International Airport in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The contract was
awarded to a new MAB subsidiary, Malaysia Airports Management and
Technical Services, via a joint venture with Aeroports de Paris. 
    Malaysia Airports Management and Technical Services is being
funded through internal sources and is initially expected to consult
with Malaysian airports to improve their management operations.
Eventually, says Khairuddin, the company is looking to market its
management expertise to Indochina, Pacific, Southeast Asian and
African countries. New airport projects in Seoul and Bangkok "may be
too big for us at the moment," he adds.
    A second subsidiary, dubbed Malaysia Airports Niaga (MAN), is
charged with expanding the retail revenue base, including hotels,
parking and shops. Concessions at Langkawi Airport, for instance,
has just been tripled to 24 locations. As concessions space becomes
more available at other Malaysian facilities, MAN will compete to
manage the concessions.
    MAN is also involved in an airport supermarket at Kuala Lumpur,
and is considering forming a joint venture to branch further in
that direction. Retail revenue accounted for 30-35% of MAB's total
revenue - about $20-$23 million - in the first six months of the
current fiscal year. Khairuddin says he would like to see that
figure increase to 50% over the next five years. Marketing its duty
free expertise overseas "in the long term. . .depends on what sort
of opportunities are available," Khairuddin explains.
    MAN's position in the organization reveals an interesting
dichotomy. "They are essentially a business organization," explains
Khairuddin, that acts as a relatively independent subsidiary and
will have to compete for all concessions opportunities at Malaysian
airports. But the company also will set price controls for duty
free and retail business to fulfill MAB's goal of making Kuala
Lumpur International Airport-Subang "an airport with the lowest duty
free pricing in this region."

ASIAN STOCKS OFF IN 1995; RETAIN $49 BILLION OF MARKET VALUE

    Fresh competitive forces are loose in Asia-Pacific, even as
world business conditions revive and traffic grows at near a double-
digit pace in the region.  Reflecting the competition, several Asian
airlines lost share values on stock exchanges in 1995, in some
cases substantially.
    Japan's two giants, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, were
off 7% and 3%, respectively, in yen. Japan Air System was down even
more sharply, 15% for the year. The other major loser was Thai
Airways International, down 20% in both local and U.S. currencies.
Even mighty Singapore Airlines lost slightly. Singapore's current
financial remain very impressive, but the dominance the carrier once
had at efficient, low-cost operation will be challenged more broadly
by others.
    This challenge is coming partly from global carriers, especially
in the U.S. But the most intense pressure is likely to be from
other Asian airlines. Cathay Pacific strengthened its route system
in 1995 and received a nice appreciation in share values. Qantas
Airways got off to a decent start as a privatized airline - the
carrier's size and position make it a threat in the Southeast
Pacific. And Air New Zealand, with much more experience at fully
private management than Qantas, is not standing still. ANZ picked up
some ground on exchanges in 1995.
    The market trimmed but hardly downgraded the bright prospects of
most Asian carriers. Even after $3.45 billion in overall share
losses, the ten airlines surveyed by AAN retained a market value of
$48.83 billion Dec. 31. That is nearly 60% more shareholder value
than the much bigger U.S. airline industry had - and it does not
even include all Asian airlines.
    Competition will continue to trim some hefty margins in Asia
1996. But the basic reason for competition -- booming passenger and
cargo markets -- justifies that huge equity stake.

NEWS IN BRIEF

    China Eastern Airlines ordered two visual systems for its Airbus
A300-600 and McDonnell Douglas MD-82 flight simulators. Both of the
new VITAL ChromaView systems from Flight Safety International will
be installed in the fourth quarter of 1996. 

    All Nippon Airways chose Pratt & Whitney and International Aero
Engines to power its recent orders for Boeing 777-300s and Airbus
A321s. Both will begin joining the fleet in 1998. The engine order
is worth an estimated $400 million. 

    National Jet Systems of Adelaide, South Australia took delivery
of its first Jetstream 41 from JSX Capital Corp. National Jet
Systems is JSX's first customer in Australia. The airline also
operates a fleet of 13 BAe 146s and an Avro RJ70.

    Cathay Pacific has decided to keep its flight training school in
Hong Kong, rather than move it to Australia as previously
considered. "Several recent developments have made it cost-effective
to keep the simulators in Hong Kong," said Captain Mick Toller,
general manager business projects. Cathay has been offered land in
Hong Kong at an attractive price and plans to invest in a new
headquarters building to accommodate staff and simulator training.  

    Air Pacific began a second weekly nonstop between Los Angeles
and Figi on Jan. 9 using Boeing 747 aircraft. The first service was
inaugurated in July 1994. 

    Ansett Worldwide, the leasing arm of the Australian airline,
extended its leases of Boeing aircraft to Brazil's Rio Sul, Vietnam
Airlines  and Crocus Airlines.       

    Air Express International, the international freight forwarder,
opened new offices in Guam and Saipan through an agreement with
Clipper Cargo Corp., one of Guam's major freight forwarders. "Guam
and Saipan have both shown solid growth in exports of finished
goods and agricultural products to the U.S. and Asia," says Jeremy
Zeitlyn, AEI's vice president for the South Pacific.

    China Southern has chosen AMR Corp.'s  SABRE Decision
Technologies (SDT) to design its new airline systems control center
in Guangzhou, China. SDT will provide all computer systems and
software, American Airlines will assist in training center employees
and SABRE Computer Services will assist in developing the air/ground
communication system. The client/server system will automate many of
the functions that are now handled manually including flight
dispatch, flight monitoring, load planning and crew scheduling. 

    Sichuan Airlines took delivery of its first Airbus A320 late
last month. The A320, leased from International Lease Finance Corp.,
is Sichuan's first Western aircraft. Sichuan will use the aircraft
on routes from its Changdu base to Beijing and other domestic
destinations. The aircraft is powered by International Aero Engines
V2527 engines. 

    China Northwest Airlines will begin service from Xi'an in the
Shaanix Province of North China to Macao starting Jan. 9, Xinhua
News Agency reports. The flights, to be operated twice weekly, will
make an intermediate stop in Changsha. China Northwest is the third
mainland carrier to begin service to Macao, with China National
Aviation Corp. and China Northern now flying there.

    Air Macao will launch a daily flight between Macao and
Koahsiung, Taiwan, Jan. 12. Air Macao operates twice-daily service
between Macao and Taipei.

    Air India has begun service to Entebbe International Airport in
Uganda. The airline will operate an Airbus A310 once a week from
Bombay. Air India suspended service to Uganda in 1972 when former
Uganda President Idi Amin expelled thousands of Indians from the
country.

U.S.-CHINA ACCORD PROVIDES FIRST NONSTOP SERVICE; OPENS CODESHARING 

    Northwest Airlines will begin the first nonstop service between
the U.S. and China on May 1. Following an accord signed by the
governments of China and the United States that allows for expanded,
direct service between the two nations. One of the most important
aspects of the air services agreement is that it opens the door for
codesharing between Chinese and U.S. carriers.   
    Detroit-Beijing service will be operated by Northwest thrice-
weekly on Boeing 747-400 aircraft. The air services agreement allows
Northwest to boost weekly service to nine in 1998. Northwest's
Shanghai service was reinstated in 1984 and today the carrier
operates to the city once weekly with one stop in Tokyo.
Northwest's current thrice-weekly Beijing service was instituted in
1992 and also stops in Tokyo.   
    Northwest has a long relationship with China. It first served
Shanghai in 1947. The airline also has pilot training contracts with
five Chinese carriers -- China Southwest, China Eastern, China
Northern, Xiamen and Shanghai Airlines. 
    The air services agreement gives China the right to begin
codesharing immediately. U.S. carriers can begin codesharing three
years from the date Chinese codesharing commences. China Eastern,
Air China and China Southern among others are very anxious to see
[codesharing] begin, says U.S. Department of Transportation
spokesperson Pat Murphy. American Airlines  and Delta Air Lines 
have also expressed great interest.    
    "We have had discussions on a couple different levels with
Chinese carriers and codesharing is certainly a possibility and we
will continue to entertain those talks," says Northwest Airlines
spokesperson Doug Killian. 
    Delta has never served China, but flies to Taiwan and Hong Kong.
"We are looking at expanding codesharing to China, but we have to
look more closely at the agreement first," says Delta spokesperson
Todd Clay. "We are approached on a regular basis from carriers
around the world and we are happy that the new bilateral agreement
will offer new opportunities in China. I suspect [the Chinese
carriers] have approached every carrier about codeshare
opportunities," he adds.
    As for American, "we haven't applied for route authority because
the key to Asia for American is Japan. We would love beyond rights
to China from Japan, but that doesn't look like it is in the plans
for our government or the Japanese government," says American
Airlines spokesperson Al Becker.

EVA PARENT CONSIDERS LAUNCHING NEW PANAMANIAN AIRLINE

    Evergreen Corp., the parent company of Taiwan's Eva Air, plans
to launch an international carrier in Panama. Evergreen will boost
its involvement in Panama in part because of the connections
Evergreen Chairman Chang Jung-fa has to the Panamanian government,
sources tell Asian Aviation News. Chang was named an investment
adviser to Panamanian President Enrest Perez Balladares last year.
    Evergreen has applied with Panamanian authorities to fly to
Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia. The airline has long-
term plans to operate to the U.S., Europe and Asia.
    Evergreen also has asked Panama's incumbent international
airline, copa, to become a minority shareholder in the new airline,
the sources say, but has not yet received any response. The offer
was made in November.
    The airline is expected to begin international service from
Panama by July. Aircraft being considered for the venture include
Boeing 767s and 757s and Airbus A340s and A330s.
    Eva operates long-haul service between Taipei and Los Angeles
and began direct service to Panama late last year.

NTSB TARGETED FOR MORE MONEY FROM SENATE FOR 1992

Senate Appropriations Committee has recommended increased funding for the
National Transportation Safety Board in fiscal 1992, including $1.5
million more for salaries and expenses than the $34.2 million approved by
the House. The committee specified that NTSB use the extra money to
relocate to new offices and for laboratory space. The amount recommended
provides for 360 full-time employees, an increase of 16 over fiscal 1991.
Aviation safety accounts for the largest portion of the funding -- $12.6
million.
   The Senate also suggested the same level for the essential air service
program as did the House bill (H.R. 2942) (DAILY, Sept. 13). Both chambers
recommended funding the requested level of $38.6 million, which is $12
million more than last year. The carrier projected to receive substantially
more than any other is Exec Express II at an estimated annual compensation
of $3.6 million.
   The Senate report accompanying the bill contains several general
provisions that are not included in the House version, or are changed from
the House version. Aviation-related provisions: -- Direct the DOT secretary
to prepare and implement a plan for providing slots at Chicago O'Hare
Airport for essential air service carriers. -- Allow FAA to increase the
amount of an airport improvement grant for Ames, Iowa. -- Allow for the
sale of Atlantic City Airport to proceed. -- Make a technical legislative
change that allows soundproofing of public/private buildings to be paid
with airport improvement grant funds. -- Allow combination aircraft to
operate in Alaska until FAA conducts a study. -- Allow the DOT secretary to
enter into a sole-source contract with the Puerto Rico Ports Authority for
the construction of an air traffic control tower. In 1991, $4 million was
appropriated for the project, which was to be arranged through a five-year
lease/purchase agreement. The administration now wants to fund the
procurement fully, which may delay other major airport improvements. The
tower and these improvements must be concurrently constructed; otherwise
line-of-sight safety may be diminished. -- Allow the FAA and Nashville
Airport to use airport improvement formula grant funds to relocate an ASR-9
air traffic radar and to purchase a temporary VORTAC system. -- Direct the
DOT secretary to conduct a noise impact study covering New York and
Connecticut to determine ways to reduce airport noise. It will go far
enough north to cover Stewart Airport in the Newburgh/Poughkeepsie area,
and also will encompass the Westchester, Staten Island, Queens and Nassau
areas. -- Direct the DOT secretary to issue regulations on airports'
ability to conduct criminal background checks for security purposes.
   House Appropriations Committee staff member Tom Kingfield last week
predicted that if the Senate is able to get the appropriations bill to the
floor soon, the two chambers could go to conference in early October and
have a package for the President to sign by mid-October. He said aviation
benefits well in both the Senate and House funding levels, noting that the
House recommendation of appropriating $8.9 billion for FAA is a 200%
increase from just 10 years ago. The Airport Improvement Program,
recommended at $1.9 billion, is up from $450 million in 1982, an increase
of 300%. Prospects for satisfactory funding of aviation programs in the
near future, however, are not looking bright. In fiscal 1994 and 1995,
there will be only one cap on spending, which will be over total domestic
spending, meaning competition among individual government agencies will be
fierce.
   Kingfield, addressing the American Association of Airport Executives and
Airport Operators Council International fall legislative issues conference,
said airport operators are fortunate they have the passenger facility
charge (PFC) to fall back on. They were advised, however, to break the link
that ties the full funding of AIP with allowing the charge of PFCs,
considering AIP probably will not be appropriated at the full level.

DOT is expected early this week to grant antitrust immunity for airlines to
discuss schedule adjustments at Honolulu Airport. The federal inspection
services have refused to accept any new arrivals in the overcrowded
international arrivals building between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m., presenting

NORTHWEST RETREAT FROM SHUTTLE DEAL OPENS DOOR FOR OTHERS

Collapse of the Northwest-Trump Shuttle deal leaves Trump in tough
financial straits and an opportunity for another carrier to step in and
purchase the assets or operation at relatively little cost. Airlines said
to be interested in the New York-Washington-Boston operation include
American, United and USAir. American, according to sources, has offered
$115 million for pieces of the operation, including gates and valuable
takeoff and landing slots. Delta paid $113 million for the Pan Am shuttle
operation, but that transaction was part of a larger deal that included
European routes, a number of aircraft and an investment in a revamped Pan
Am.
   USAir showed interest in the airline in earlier discussions, but
financial troubles at the carrier make an acquisition of the operation or
the bulk of the assets unlikely. While United is said to have expressed
interest in the shuttle, an attempt to purchase the airline could face
Justice Department opposition because of United's strong presence in the
Washington, D.C., area. The government objected to efforts by that airline
to purchase Eastern gates and slots at Washington National Airport earlier
this year. Those assets wound up being sold to Northwest.
   The Trump Shuttle, although in financial trouble, has enough cash to
operate at least through the end of the month, one source told The DAILY.
The carrier has been earning a steady stream of money from its charter
operations, and its revenues are up slightly, as business travel in the
market has returned after the slow summer period. But the Trump
organization and its shuttle operation still face a heavy debt burden.
Trump bought the shuttle from Eastern in 1989 for $365 million and has
invested tens of millions of dollars in refurbishing the operation's 727
aircraft and fitting them with hush kits. Meanwhile, the market has
contracted drastically over the past few years, pushing revenues down
sharply.
   Signs were evident as early as two weeks ago that the deal might be
falling apart (DAILY, Sept. 6) Northwest said it was unable to conclude an
agreement with its Machinists union that would allow it to assume control
of the shuttle, but one union leader at Trump suggested that an impasse
with the union might be a way for Northwest to back out of the transaction.
A lack of money on the part of Northwest, stiffening competition from Delta
and the possibility of a deal with Continental, which could give Northwest
a shuttle operation all are likely to have contributed to the decision to
pull back.
   While other unions at the carrier agreed to alter their contracts to go
ahead with the deal, Machinists had been holding out for several
concessions. One included a provision to put Trump workers at pay parity
with employees at Northwest, a move which would have cost Northwest more
than $10 million extra, one source said. Other conditions were that they be
automatically recognized as the collective bargaining agent of the ticket
agents at Trump and that a rival union, Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal
Association, agree to step down as the representatives of mechanics at
Trump, which AMFA agreed to with some conditions.
   Delta took possession of the Pan Am Shuttle at the beginning of the
month. The carrier initially had some problems integrating the airline into
its operation but now says those problems have been worked out. A Delta
spokeswoman said the carrier has been running extra sections almost daily
during the week to accommodate passengers and has established an on-time
record so far of about 95%.

LOT POLISH AIRLINES ORDERS NINE 737S

LOT, national carrier of Poland, ordered nine 737 -400 and -500 aircraft
from Boeing to be delivered between 1992 and 1994. New aircraft are to be
used on LOT's intra-European routes. LOT now has three 767s and is pursuing
options for five more with delivery in 1994. Earlier last week, the Polish
government refused to investigate an aircraft deal in which McDonnell
Douglas claimed it had a firm commitment from LOT for the purchase of its
aircraft (DAILY, Sept. 9).

BAA REDUCES TRAFFIC GROWTH FORECAST

BAA plc, formerly the British Airports Authority, has reduced its forecast
of traffic growth over the next five years. BAA, an airport management and
development company, now expects to handle a total of 86.5 million
passengers in 1995, a decrease of 3.5 million from the number it predicted
a year ago. But BAA also said that, over the 15-year forecast, annual
passenger traffic is expected to grow from the current 74 million to
between 115 million and 150 million, implying average growth of between 3%
and 4.8% anually. U.K.-based BAA said it reduced its forecast because of
the depth of the current recession.
   BAA's core business is the ownership and operation of airports.
Through its subsidiaries at London Heathrow, London Gatwick, London
Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Prestwick, Aberdeen and South-ampton, BAA
handles 70% of U.K. passenger traffic and 85% of air cargo. Company
forecasts that air transport movements will grow at an average rate of
1.7% to 2.4% per year,with levels by 2005 reaching 30% to 40% higher than
in 1990. Cargo tonnage also is expected to grow, with volume by 2005
expected to be between 40% and 100% higher than that recorded in 1990.

IATA CALLS FOR GOVERNMENT TO DROP PLANS FOR APHIS FEE

International Air Transport Association (IATA) is the latest to put
pressure on the Agriculture Department to withdraw its proposal to charge
user fees to pay for aircraft inspection by the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS). IATA said it believes the fee would "contravene
the obligations of the United States under the Chicago Convention, U.S. air
transport services agreements and U.S. treaties of friendship, commerce and
navigation." Several foreign carriers have complained about the proposed
fees, saying they violate air agreements. IATA said a rule setting up the
fee would exceed the service's statutory mandate.

UNITED LOOKING AT SINGAPORE AS POSSIBLE HUB

United plans to build on its presence at Singapore over the next few years
and sees an opportunity to develop a small connecting hub there, according
to William Speicher, senior VP-Pacific. Speicher said United has informed
the government of Singapore that the airline is considering flying to other
destinations in the region -- such as Malaysia and Indonesia -- from
Singapore. Carrier currently operates three flights a day from Singapore
and has just won approval from the government of Singapore to build an
8,000-square-foot passenger lounge at Changi Airport. Speicher said United
would not have made the type of financial commitment it has made in
Singapore if it did not intend to grow at Changi. United's primary
Asia/Pacific region hub is Tokyo, and it has smaller hub operations at
Seoul and Taipei.
    In 1990, Pacific division traffic growth accounted for much of
United's full-year increase in systemwide revenue passenger miles. But
1991 has been a different story. Through the first eight months this year,
United's Pacific division traffic was down 3.5% from a year ago. Large
part of the problem has been the slow recovery of traffic from Japan since
the end of the Gulf War. Japanese traffic did not return to even 1990
levels until last month, and Speicher said traffic in the market will
probably remain flat, compared to 1990, for the rest of this year. He
described the Japanese market as the cornerstone of United's Pacific
division.
   Decline in United's Pacific RPMs also can be traced to the carrier's
relatively small growth for the year. Through the first eight months this
year, its Pacific division capacity increased only 4.5% from year- ago
levels, which is nearly 12 percentage points below the carrier's plan for
the year. Speicher said the airline had planned to increase its Pacific
capacity 16% this year, but when the year is over, the gain will probably
be only 4% over 1990. United's traffic also has been diluted by an increase
in overall available capacity in the Asia/Pacific region. Speicher said
capacity in the area is finally beginning to catch up with demand. United's
Pacific plans for 1992 do not include any new routes, but the carrier does
plan to switch existing aircraft for 747-400s on some routes. Overall,
United expects its Pacific capacity to increase 8%-10% next year.

AMERICA WEST, NORTHWEST SIGN STANDSTILL AGREEMENT

America West has signed a standstill agreement with Northwest that
precludes any merger or takeover activity between the two airlines for the
duration of their 10-year marketing alliance. Standstill agreement is
subject to approval by the bankruptcy court in the America West Chapter 11
proceeding. Agreement, however, contains an escape clause releasing
Northwest from the terms of the pact should a third party attempt a hostile
takeover of America West. Also, the pact will not affect Northwest's
two-year option to acquire America West's Honolulu- Nagoya route or America
West's two-year put option, which would require Northwest to buy the route
if requested to do so by America West.
   "This standstill agreement reaffirms both our intentions and those of
Northwest that the marketing alliance is not a prelude to any change of
control," said Michael Conway, president ofAmerica West, who adds the title
of chief executive this week. "We entered into the agreement based on our
conviction that both airlines would benefit by working together as
independent carriers, and nothing has occurred to alter that view," he
said.
   While the marketing agreement may not be a prelude to any change in
control, Northwest will have at least a voice in America West's operations.
Agreements signed by America West with Northwest and GPA, which together
are putting up $55 million in debtor-in-possession financing for America
West, give GPA and Northwest each one seat on America West's board. Pact
also call for America West to establish a five-member executive committee
of the board to monitor the company's progress against its operating plan.
Board is to be composed of representatives from GPA, America West's primary
aircraft supplier, and Northwest in addition to three members selected by
the board.
   Conway said America West and Northwest are meeting to work out the
details of the code-sharing and joint marketing efforts that will initially
include feeding passengers between America West's route network and
Northwest's Pacific gateways. Marketing alliance also includes the
possibility for mutually agreed upon passenger and cargo fare proration
levels; the review and possible consolidation of frequently flyer and other
marketing programs; the reciprocal use of airport clubs, as well as the
review and revisions to mutual benefit of service levels to certain
cities.

VASP TARGETING WEST COAST FOR SERVICE FROM BRAZIL

Brazilian carrier Vasp has requested an exemption from DOT to allow it to
provide scheduled combination service to Los Angeles and San Francisco from
Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Manaus via Lima, Peru. The carrier said it
intends to begin operating three weekly flights from the Brazilian cities
to Los Angeles with continuing service to San Francisco Oct. 26. On Oct.
27, it plans to offer one weekly flight from only Rio de Janeiro and Sao
Paulo to Los Angeles and San Francisco via Lima. All flights would use
255-seat DC-10-30 aircraft.
   "VASP makes this request as the first step of its effort to inject
competition into the United States-Brazil markets," the carrier said.
VASP's new international directorate has made international growth and
improvement in service its top priorities for 1991, the carrier said. It
also asked DOT to make a decision on its request no later than tomorrow.
As of Dec. 31, 1990, VASP's fleet consisted of 21 737-200s, 10 737-300s,
three A300 B2s and two 737-200 all-cargo aircraft. It has since obtained
more cargo aircraft and the DC-10s for the service to the West Coast.
Several U.S. carriers currently are involved in a selection proceeding to
win new rights to serve Brazil. (Docket 47745)

NIPPON CARGO SEEKS QUICK ACTION ON CERTIFICATE AMENDMENT

Nippon Cargo Airlines has asked DOT to take immediate action on its request
to serve several U.S. cities from Tokyo, which it filed almost eight months
ago. The carrier asked that it be authorized on its certificate to provide
all-cargo service to co-terminal points San Francisco and New York, Chicago
and New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco. Nippon requests action no
later than Oct. 15.
   The carrier's permit currently allows it to conduct nine scheduled
frequencies per week from Tokyo to San Francisco and New York, as well as
provide additional flights per year, and to conduct charter flights. NCA
was granted exemptions in March to co-terminalize its service to Chicago
with New York and its service to San Francisco with Los Angeles. That
authority was granted for only a short term because of U.S. concerns about
landing slots at Tokyo Narita Airport, and expires Oct. 28. The carrier,
therefore, is asking the department to add the Chicago/Los Angeles
co-terminalization authority (Docket 47387)

LEBANESE AIRLINES SEEKS PERMISSION TO FLY DIGNITARIES TO U.N. ASSEMBLY

Middle East Airlines Airliban (MEA) has requested an emergency exemption
from DOT to operate one roundtrip charter from Beirut to New York on or

trip is to transport Lebanon's president, prime minister and speaker of the
house to attend the General Assembly of the United Nations. A 747- 200
would be chartered for the trip. MEA in the past operated Lebanon- New York
flights via Paris, but the carrier's exemption was revoked in 1985 because
of the volatile political situation in Lebanon and "the possibility of
interference with aircraft bound for the U.S. while on the ground in
Lebanon." (Docket 47746)

OLYMPIC AIRWAYS TAKES FIRST 737-400

Olympic Airways has taken delivery of its first 737-400, its first jet from
Boeing in 10 years, and the first in the carrier's new livery, Boeing
announced. With the delivery, Boeing confirmed that Greece's flag carrier
has ordered six 737-400s and taken options on six more. Value of the firm
orders is approximately $220 million. Loukas Grammatikos, Olympic's
director general, said the airline ordered the aircraft to continue
expansion of its medium-range fleet and to begin replacing less efficient
727s, which the airline has been flying since the late 1960s.
   Grammatikos also said that, with the delivery of the new aircraft, the
airline is eliminating its current first and business classes and replacing
them with "Olympian Executive Class," which it described as a high-quality
business-class service. He also said Olympic will be one of the few
European airlines offering inflight movies on flights in Europe and the
Middle East.

COMMON EUROPEAN CREW LICENSE SYSTEM APPROVED BY MINISTERS
French Win Flight Attendant Objection

(Luxembourg)
European Economic Community transport ministers have agreed to a system of
common licensing for member nation air transport crews, beginning Jan. 1
when the states will accept as valid cockpit crew licenses obtained in
other EC countries. Rejected, however, was a similar proposal for cabin
crew members. European Commission was empowered to develop regulations
leading to pan- European license, and expected to complete development of
these common rules by the end of 1992. The French, who have stricter
standards for flight attendants than other EEC nations, objected to
including cabin crews in the initial phase of the changeover to a common
European license.
   In another major development, the ministers agreed to incorporate Joint
Airworthiness Requirements (JARs) into European Community law, making their
application mandatory throughout the EEC. Decision came only after heated
debate between the Commission and ministers from member states over
procedures to be used before the technical rules could be adopted into EEC
law.
   The Commission, composed of independent civil servants, sought sole
authorisation to transcribe the JARs into Community law after simple
consultation with a committee of experts. The transport ministers wanted
the last word on the adoption of all standards, and they rejected the
Commission view that the debates would be extended by presenting every JAR
to ministers who would have the interests of their own countries in mind.
   Final agreement calls for a regulatory committee of experts from member
states to assist the Commission. The committee must first adopt each new
measure before it can be incorporated into EEC law.
   Also at the meeting, the ministers took up the thorny issue of waivers
to noise rules after Greece complained the phaseout of some Chapter 2
aircraft as early as 1995 would be too expensive for Olympic Airways.
Olympic is looking for a temporary exemption for its Boeing 737-200s.
   A similar exemption is being considered for Third World country
airlines. The Commission staff is developing a list of these airlines and
their aircraft, with the issue to be raised again at the Dec. 16-17
transport ministers' meeting.
   The ministers failed to adopt a proposal that would have extended the
Community's transport regulations to Sweden and Norway, a decision that is
unlikely to mean any radical change for SAS. That airline, because of the
involvement in its structure of Denmark, a Community member, already was
following Community rules.
   Agreement, which was to formalise the arrangement for SAS, was rejected
on procedural grounds, and will be raised again at a forthcoming meeting of
the ministers.
   SAS is supporting extension of EEC rules to Sweden and Norway, seeing
this action as a means to obtain further marketing opportunities in the
face of stiffening competition from Community airlines.

AIRLINE EXECUTIVES ATTACK COMPETITION POLICY,URGE IMMEDIATE ACTION ON ATC

   European airline chief executives, describing the European Commission's
stand on competition between Community carriers as "ideological," have
attacked it claiming attempts to create more competition were misguided and
damaging to the industry.
   Led by Air France's Bernard Attali, the heads of five members of the
Association of European Airlines (AEA) told Competition Commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan, and Transport Commissioner Karel Van Miert, in a "frank
exchange" that their attempts to create more competition ignored the
economics of the airline business.
   European airlines are worried the Commissions competition watchdogs are
subjecting routes where only two carriers operate to increased scrutiny.
The presumption appears to be that only two carriers operating on a route
is suspicious and the situation should be looked at.
   Joining Attali were the chief executives of Alitalia, Lufthansa, KLM and
Swissair, who also called for urgentaction to reform Europe's inefficient
and often cash-starved air traffic control system, run by individual
countries. Air traffic problems are a major source of airline delays.
   Disagreement with the Commission on the competition issue comes as the
EC is asking for an increase in its powers to oversee airline competition.
EC has asked member governments for approval to examine competition on
routes within countries in the 12-nation Community and routes between
Community and third countries.
   Major airlines are worried by a commission proposal on slot allocation,
designed at encouraging new entrants at congested European airports, apart
from Amsterdam's Schiphol, by taking slots from large operators and
redistributing them.
   Brittan and Van Miert "do not seem to understand that some routes cannot
support more than two operators. If you added a third, all three would be
running at a loss," said an AEA spokeswoman.
   Attali told Commissioners their polices were injecting uncertainty into
the airline industry when companies needed to plan years ahead on airline
orders and strategy.
   Commission plans also were attacked as shortsighted since they only take
into account competition between airlines and ignore the fact airlines
compete with cars and Europe's fast developing high-speed train network.
   On the air traffic control problem, the executives, according to the AEA
spokeswoman, said "We are creating a Europe without borders on the ground
but they still exist in the air."
   Transport Commissioner Karel Van Miert last month called for
Eurocontrol's powers to be boosted as a means of creating a unified
European air traffic control unit.

AIR FRANCE SUMMONED BY GOVERNMENT TO EXPLAIN PENDING JOB CUTS
Cresson and Attali in Private Talks

   Air France's plan to cut its workforce by 3,000 by the end of 1993 has
come under government scrutiny, with the carrier's president, Bernard
Attali, being summoned to see Prime Minister Edith Cresson to explain the
actions of the state-controlled company.
   The Cresson government is angered that a series of state-run companies,
including Air France and auto maker Renault, have announced plans to cut
their work forces when French unemployment is above the average of its
European Community neighbors and shows no sign of falling. Cresson told the
French Parliament that state-run companies should only announce layoffs
after consultations with the unions, the government and the Employment
Ministry.
   Air France has refused to comment on the meeting or on whether its plans
to save 1.5 billion French francs a year would change. Most of the
employment cutbacks are expected to come through attrition and voluntary
early retirement.
   Cresson is reported to have shocked executives of state-run companies by
suggesting they cut their pay in proportion to the cuts in staff. Head of
Aerospatiale is said to have asked for a raise because he is taking on more
workers.

SABENA TAKES A BACKSEAT AS BELGIAN GOVERNMENT COLLAPSE

   Future of Belgian airline Sabena has taken a backseat as the government
wavered and finally resigned Friday. Spokeswoman for the Ministry of
Transport said the Sabena file has been delayed by the coalition squabble
about arms shipments and telecommunications contracts.
   Air France is now recognized as the front runner to take a stake in and
conclude a wide partnership agreement with Sabena. A spokeswoman for the
airline said the Air France talks had progressed further than those with
British Airways. BA is said to have balked when asked to put in more money
for a bigger share of Sabena.

TRANS-EUROPEAN SELLS TOUR SUBSIDIARY

Trans-European Airlines, Belgium's second largest carrier, has received a
much-needed cash infusion by selling its tour subsidiary, Sunsnacks, for a
reported 670 million Belgian francs.
   TEA, which is operating under the Belgian equivalent of Chapter 11
bankruptcy, is in desperate need of cash to meet its debts. Sale of
Sunsnacks to Neckermann, the Belgian tour subsidiary of Europe's fourth
largest tour operator, Frankfurt-based NUR Touristic, came as TEA's U.K.
subsidiary ceased operations.
   Charter carrier TEA U.K. ceased operations when Manchester Airport
officials impounded one of its five Boeing 737s for non-payment of landing
fees. TEA U.K. operated from Manchester, London Gatwick and East Midlands
airports.
   French charter subsidiary, TEA-France, continues to operate and search
for a new shareholder in spite of its announcement to a Nanterre commercial
court that it has stopped making debt payments. Neckermann said TEA
Belgium would continue providing charter service for Sunsnacks.

IBERIA DELIVERIES PUSHED BACK TWO YEARS

   Iberia, facing a $450 million loss this year, has renegotiated the
delivery schedule for new aircraft purchased from the big three
manufacturers, postponing deliveries of new Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas and
Airbus aircraft by two years.
   Spanish carrier said post-Persian Gulf War market trends forced it to
reconsider its original schedule.
   The carrier originally placed orders for 24 McDonnell Douglas MD-87s, 22
Airbus A320s, six A340s, and 16 Boeing 757s, with the total value of the
package coming to $4 billion. All the MD-87s and 12 A320s have been
delivered. Delivery of another A320 was postponed from 1991 to 1993.
   Delivery of the eight A340s, scheduled for 1994, will be spread over two
years into 1995. New schedule for the Boeing aircraft, programmed for 1993
and 1994, calls for three to be delivered in 1993, five in 1994, three in
1995 and five in 1996.

start of the airline's recovery.
   The carrier already is the leading airline operating from London Gatwick
Airport, with 17.7% of total traffic, a position strengthened by the
collapse of Air Europe.
   At the same time that Davies and Newman disclosed the stock issue, the
company also revealed it had incurred a pre-tax loss of 40.4 million pounds
sterling for the first half of 1991. Loss for the full year should amount
to 35 million pounds sterling, compared with 38.8 million pounds sterling
in 1990.
   Turnover for the first half of 1991 amounted to 139.2 million pounds
sterling, down 19% from last year's 171.2 million pounds sterling.
   David James, chairman of Davies and Newman, said the share issue will be
used to purchase 20 737 aircraft over the next four years, and to
inaugurate 11 new routes. Carrier will not increase the size of its 38-
airplane fleet, but will replace older 727s and BAC-111s with newer 300-
and 400-series 737s.
   Earlier this year, Dan-Air applied to the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority
for 11 route licenses to complete its European network. Routes from London
Gatwick to Oslo, Stockholm, Rome, Athens, Istanbul, Cairo and Barcelona
should be started by the end of the year or early next year. Dusseldorf,
Malta, Palma de Majorca and Copenhagen will be added later.
   Dan-Air had been considering flights from Berlin to Moscow and other
Eastern European cities, but decided not to proceed with the project.

FINNAIR OFFERS TO HELP ESTONIAN AIRLINE

   Finnair has offered to help Baltic state Estonia create its own airline
by giving technical help and experience. The offer came on the opening of
a new sales office in the capital Talinn. Finnair currently flies five
times a week to Talinn but intends soon to step up flights to twice daily.
It also is looking at developing flights to the Latvian capital Riga.

ALITALIA POSTS FIRST-HALF LOSS, EXPECTS NEAR BREAKEVEN SECOND HALF

   Alitalia reported a 104.2 billion lira loss for the first six months of
1991, the airline announced, compared with a 75 billion loss for the same
period last year. One dollar equals about 1,259.90 lira at recent exchange
rates. The airline carried out sale and lease-back transactions of aircraft
that produced 155.3 billion lira. Alitalia said it was particularly
penalized by the Gulf War because of its geographical position and emphasis
on service to the Middle East. Despite a 39% falloff of international
traffic in February, the carrier said it bounced back better than other
European airlines, with traffic share increases of 2% to Germany, 5% to
Spain, 4% on long-haul routes and 8% to the U.S.
   For the period, total revenue shrank 16.5% from 2.103 billion lira in
the first half of 1990 to 2.086 billion lira this year. With a set-aside
of 156.8 billion lira, the carrier had an operating loss of 90.6 billion
lira. The airline said it expects to reach near breakeven revenues in the
second half of the year despite the uncertain economic outlook.

SAS SHUTS DOWN NORDIC, TRANSATLANTIC ROUTES

   SAS is ceasing operations on three intercontinental route and one
between Sweden and Finland, saying the decision was temporary but related
to poor profitability on all four routes. Copenhagen to Sao Paolo, Chicago
and Toronto will be closed down, as will Stockholm-Tammersfors, Finland's
second largest city.
   Airline, which is negotiating sharp salary cuts with its pilots, said it
does not exclude abandoning more routes. The wage cuts, it said, are
indispensable if SAS is to remain one of five surviving intercontinental
airlines in Europe by 1995, SAS said.
   The carrier will relinquish traffic rights between Copenhagen and
Toronto in the summer of 1992 to its partner, Austrian Airlines, which will
fly to Toronto from Vienna via Copenhagen. Danish charter company Sterling
Airways is interested in the route.
   Sao Paolo route could go to SAS's other partner, Swissair, although no
decision has been made.
  SAS will cease operations between Copenhagen and Tammersfors, 200 miles
north of Helsinki, Oct. 27.
   Scandinavian carrier also has decided to close its Copenhagen-Belgrade
route, which it had flown five times weekly. SAS cited security and low
load factors as reasons.

AUSTRIAN AIRLINES BUYS AIRBUS FOR VIENNA-LOS ANGELES ROUTE

   Austrian Airlines has ordered two A340-300s, and taken an option for two
more, to be used on African and Asian routes, and a new Vienna-Los Angeles
route. Aircraft, to be delivered in December 1993 or January 1994, would be
operated Vienna-Johannesburg, Vienna-Tokyo, and the carriers's new
Vienna-Los Angeles route, which it intends to inaugurate at that time.
   Austrian flies to Johannesburg via Nairobi once a week, but intends to
double that frequency by the end of this month. It will open a new route
to Nairobi Oct. 9, and hopes to obtain the necessary authorisation to link
up with Johannesburg within the following weeks.
   In keeping with its decision to focus on East European routes, Austrian
also is doubling the frequency of its flights to Kiev. Beginning this
month, it will fly four times a week to the Ukrainian capital, and
negotiations are under way for the launch of a route to one of the Baltic
states by the end of March 1992.

NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT IN TALKS TO OPEN UP NORTHERN MARKET

   The Norwegian government is in the middle of negotiations that could
result in 200,000 extra passengers a year for Scandinavian carrier SAS.
Negotiations are taking place between the Ministry of Defense and the
Ministry of Communications over whether the military should end its well-
developed services in northern Norway in favor of civilian companies.
Military services have arranged a program to give soldiers and their
families the six free flights a year home they are given as a right. SAS
has been lobbying hard for the last 20 years for such a move and for the
first time, it appears the military may give way. Such a move would double
SAS's northern Norway market overnight and give the carrier a chance of
breaking even after losing 90 million Norwegian kroner on services last
year. One dollar equals about 6.59 Norwegian kroner at recent exchange
rates. SAS has warned that it might have to end loss-making services in
northern Norway as it streamlines to prepare for the 1993 liberalization of
the European airline market. The carrier says it could easily cope with
the new demand because existing flights are underused.

IATA PROTESTS FINNISH TRAVEL TAX PROPOSAL

   International Air Transport Association yesterday labeled a proposed
Finnish travel tax a "rip-off" and charged that the tax is designed only to
generate revenue for the government and would not provide any benefits for
airlines or travelers. According to IATA, the tax would apply to all
travelers leaving the country using tickets purchased locally. Scheduled
airline passengers would pay roughly $37 per departure and charter
passengers would pay $49 if the tax proposal is adopted by the Finnish
Parliament and the country's president.
   "This proposed tax on travel is just a rip-off," charged IATA Director
General Guenter Eser. "It does nothing for the passenger and the Finnish
government has the nerve to expect the airlines and agents to collect the
money," he said. "This taxation is going on all over the world and, sooner
or later, the consumers are going to decide that they have had enough."

FINNAIR BEGINS TALKS WITH LUFTHANSA AS IT LEAVES QUALITY ALLIANCE

   Finnair and Germany's Lufthansa announced the start of partnership
negotiations after Finnair withdrew from the European Quality Alliance
(EQA) partnership with SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines.
   A Finnair spokesman said talks with Lufthansa could center on reviving
joint flight agreements that ended in the 1980s. He pointed out that both
Finnair and Lufthansa were actively extending their networks to the Baltic
states and Eastern Europe.
   Negotiations, which start immediately, will aim to have some agreements
in place for the start of summer 1992's timetable.
   A deal between Finnair and Lufthansa would appear to make commercial
sense. Finnair flies to five destinations in Germany, more than to any
other country. Lufthansa recently stepped up flights to Finland and
announced new services to Latvia starting November.
   Lufthansa for its part said the companies would increase cooperation in
both the freight and passenger sectors. Links might extend to catering and
technology, it added. The Finnair withdrawal from the EQA was a bid for
independence as the other companies decided to enter into even closer
cooperation.
   The closer cooperation, agreed in Vienna on September 30, will focus on
marketing and sales,a joint traffic system and product cooperation. It will
stop short of mergers between the three remaining EQA airlines.
   The cooperation will cut costs and increase the companies' market share,
the partners said. Finnair will negotiate bilaterally with the EQA partners
about existing agreements. The hourly shuttle service between Helsinki and
Stockholm will continue. The EQA partnership was already close before the
Vienna decision. Partners share office space, handle each other's airport
services and exchange cockpit crews. Scandinavian Airlines System took
partnership with Finnair one step further when its tour operator,
Vingresor, took a 50% stake in Finnair's tour company Toivelomat and
Finnair acquired a minority stake in SAS International Hotels.

PARIS AIRPORTS PROFITS DOWN 45 PERCENT

   Net profits of the state-owned company, Aeroports de Paris, which
operates Paris' airports, dropped 45.5% in the first half of 1991, to 90.4
million French francs from 165.6 million French francs earned in the first
half of 1990. Turnover declined slightly, reaching 2.462 billion French
francs, compared with 2.511 billion the previous period.
   Traffic also declined, showing a 9.9% decrease between January and June
1991 compared with last year. Most pronounced drop, 11%, was in
international traffic, while domestic traffic was off 7.4%. Company
attributed the decline to the effects of the Persian Gulf War on North
African and Middle Eastern routes out of Paris.
   Turnaround appears to have started. Traffic in July grew slightly and
remained stable in August. The trend, if it persists, would offset much of
the first six months' decline in passenger count and bring profits for the
year to 350 million French francs.

BRUSSELS INSTITUTES PENALTIES FOR CHAPTER 2 AND NIGHT OPERATIONS

   Brussels Airport has approved penalties for operating Chapter 2 aircraft
but has stayed their implementation temporarily because noise equipment is
not in place. Airport will instead issue warnings to airlines flying the
aircraft, threatening an eventual ban on their operations.
   Meanwhile, the airport approved higher landing fees for night
operations, an attempt to encourage more daytime scheduling of flights.
Collection of the night-time fees was implemented Oct. 1.
   New rules provide economic incentives to use quieter aircraft. Belgium
Ministry of Transport said a 30-tonne aircraft rated as Chapter 3 would pay
a nighttime landing fee of 4,800 Belgian francs, compared with 5,400
Belgian francs previously.
   A similar aircraft rated Chapter 3, however, would see landing fees for
night operations climb, from approximately 7,860 Belgian francs to 9,240
Belgian francs.

NEW REGIONAL AIRPORT OPENED IN FRANCE

   A new airport designed to group the activities of two neighbouring
French regional airports at Metz and Nancy, will begin operations this
month in the northeast of France.
   The international Metz-Nancy-Lorraine airport will open Oct. 28, with a
2.5 km runway and a terminal with capacity of 200,000 passengers a year. It
will not be suitable for large aircraft, or for freight traffic.
   All of TAT's flights to Metz and Nancy will converge on the new
facility. The French carrier operates internal routes to Paris, Lille,
Marseille, Nice, Nantes, Bordeaux and Lyon.
   Airport's international label results from its use by Luxemburg airline,
Luxair, which will operate a 29-seat Embraer Brasilia to London Stansted
via Metz-Nancy-Lorraine six times a week.

OAA CARRIERS AGREE ON YIELD PRESERVATION

Orient Airlines Association's 14 member carriers have informally agreed
that projected increases in traffic and capacity in the Asia/Pacific region
not be achieved at the expense of lower yields and higher breakeven load
factors. Organization, at its 35th Assembly of Presidents in Hong Kong,
issued a statement saying that "further yield deterioration will severely
impact on the viability of airline operations."
   OAA expects passenger traffic to increase 9.5% and freight traffic to
grow 11.5% annually over the next four to five years. Capacity in the
region is expected to increase 10-12% annually. OAA member carriers posted
a combined operating profit of just over $2 billion for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1991, down 22.1% from a year earlier, when the OAA airlines
had a systemwide operating profit of $2.6 billion. Operating revenues
increased 8.5% in fiscal 1990/91 to $30.8 billion, but operating expenses
were up $28.8 billion.
   Airlines carried a combined 129.6 million passengers, up from 120.6
million a year earlier. Passenger traffic increased 5.2% to 271.3 billion
revenue passenger kilometers and capacity 5.6% to 374.3 billion available
seat kilometers.

ND IL JUDGE DENIES
MOTION TO REMAND ROSELAWN
CASES TO STATE COURT

     U.S. District Judge Ruben Castillo, while noting the "vague
and circuitous language" of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
(FSIA), denied on Nov. 17 the motion of plaintiffs in litigation
involving the 1994 crash of an American Eagle plane to remand
their cases to Illinois state court.  Air Crash Near Roselawn,
IN, No. 1070 (J.P.M.L.); No. 95 C 4593 (ND IL).

     The FSIA provides the sole basis for obtaining U.S. court
jurisdiction over a foreign state.

     American Eagle Flight 4184 from Indianapolis to Chicago
crashed on Oct. 31, 1994.  All 64 passengers and four crew
members were killed.  Twenty-one suits were filed in Cook County
Circuit Court and removed to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois by defendant Avions de Transport,
Regional, G.I.E. (ATR), the manufacturers of the ATR-72-210
aircraft.  Plaintiffs then moved to remand the cases to state
court.

     Plaintiffs argued that the FSIA did not apply because ATR
was not an agency of a foreign government, but rather a private
corporation in which the governments of France and Italy have an
interest.  ATR countered that the interests of the two countries,
when "pooled," are sufficient to meet FSIA requirements.

     Judge Castillo held, "There is simply no sound policy
justification for reading the FSIA to apply to an entity majority
owned by one foreign state but not to apply to an entity majority
owned by two or more foreign states.  The sensitive concerns
raised by a federal court's exercise of jurisdiction over a
foreign sovereign are no less implicated in the latter context.
Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs' argument that pooling is
impermissible."

     The judge next considered the "tiering" of ownership
interests, noting that the two governments owned ATR through
intermediate corporate entities.  "Because we find that an entity
that is majority owned by an agency or instrumentality of a
foreign state meets the definition of a foreign state under the
FSIA, we further find that tiering of ownership interests is
perfectly permissible for purposes of determining whether an
entity is entitled to foreign state status under the Act," Judge
Castillo ruled.

     "Contrary to plaintiffs' contentions, we do not believe that
permitting both pooling and tiering, as we do in the present
case, so far removes the foreign state from the entity named as
the defendant as to unduly expand the scope of the FSIA beyond
that contemplated by Congress."

     Judge Castillo then held that in actions where the foreign
state is a third-party defendant, it may properly remove the
entire action, including the underlying action against non-ATR
defendants, to the federal court.

     The judge also ruled that the FSIA, under which the foreign
state is subject to a bench trial only, does not violate the
Seventh Amendment by conferring jury-immunity on a corporation
owned by  foreign states, and that plaintiffs are entitled to
jury trials on claims against the non-foreign state defendants.

     Judge Castillo said he will consider certification of the
ruling for interlocutory appeal to the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court
of Appeals.

     Plaintiffs' liaison counsel is Kevin M. Forde of Chicago.
Defendants' liaison counsel is Sidney I. Schenker of Jenner &
Block in Chicago.

WARSAW CONVENTION DAMAGES
LIMITATION MAY APPLY
IN COLOMBIA CRASH

     Although American Airlines was one of the carriers that
agreed to waive the $75,000 to $100,000 limit on compensatory
damages under the Warsaw Convention on international aviation,
whether the cap will be applied to cases arising from the crash
of an American flight at Cali, Colombia on Dec. 20 remains in
question.

     Members of the International Air Transport Association
(IATA) agreed to lift the Warsaw cap on Oct. 31, 1995, but
although 22 overseas airlines have signed the IATA agreement,
American and other U.S. carriers have not yet done so.  Those
airlines are attempting to work out a detailed agreement but
nothing has been finalized.  They must also receive approval from
the U.S. Department of Transportation.

     The Convention caps compensatory damages unless plaintiffs
prove willful misconduct on the part of the defendant airline, as
in the Pan Am Lockerbie cases and the Korean Air Lines Disaster
cases involving the 1983 shootdown of a KAL jet by the Soviet
Union.

     Claims against American are being handled by Robert L.
Alpert of International Claims & Litigation Management Group,
Inc.  American Airlines officials would not comment on the
matter.

     Lee S. Kreindler of Kreindler & Kreindler in New York City,
the lead plaintiff attorney in Lockerbie who expects his firm to
be involved in the Cali crash litigation, said American risks bad
publicity if it seeks to keep damages under the Warsaw limit
after agreeing in principle to lift the cap.  Kreindler told the
National Law Journal that American most likely will offer money
in excess of the limit.

     "The Cali accident has to be evaluated as a Warsaw case in
which the passengers will have to prove willful misconduct to get
realistic damages," Kreindler said.  "If it turns out that
American either breaks with other American carriers or Alpert
says, 'I tear up the Warsaw Convention,' then we may be
pleasantly surprised."

SHIPPERS SAY FEE AWARD
AGAINST CARGO AIRLINE
NOT A FEDERAL MATTER

     In an opposition brief filed Oct. 19 with the U.S. Supreme
Court, Georgia Pacific Corp. and BTL Specialty Resins Corp.
contend that attorney fees imposed against petitioner Burlington
Air Express in a lost cargo case were awarded under a Georgia
statute and not federal law, making Burlington's arguments
inappropriate for U.S. Supreme Court review.  Burlington Air
Express, Inc. v. Georgia Pacific Corp. et al., No. 95-560 (U.S.);
see Aviation LR, Dec. 26, 1995.

     Burlington contends that cargo airlines are not subject to
the Interstate Commerce Act and have been placed outside the
jurisdiction of any regulatory commission or agency by the
Airline Deregulation Act.

     Georgia Pacific and BTL (respondents) say the state court
award was based on evidence of bad faith and "stubborn
litigiousness" associated with their insurance claim on the lost
cargo, under a Georgia litigation expense statute.  That judgment
was ancillary to, but independent of, the underlying claim, the
respondents argue.  "The Georgia courts did not award Respondents
their attorney's fees and expenses under the Interstate Commerce
Act, the Airline Deregulation Act, federal common law, or any
other federal authority," the brief states.

     "A review of the Georgia decisions discusses the appropriate
federal law to apply to Respondents' claims, and Petitioner's
defenses, only on the insured values of the lost shipments.  If
Petitioner had wanted a clarification of the law on a claim
against an air carrier for lost shipments, the making of an
interpretation of shipping contracts, the limitation of tariffs,
and other defenses associated with air cargo carriers, Petitioner
should have sought certiorari on the appropriate judgment."

     Respondents contend, "There is no federal question
presented.  If Petitioner does not like Georgia law, it should
take care not to act in bad faith, or it should not do business
in Georgia."

     In affirming the fee award, the Georgia Court of Appeals
held, "Although deregulation took Air Cargo Carriers outside the
jurisdiction of any regulatory commission or agency, the body of
laws and principles expressed in the [Interstate Commerce] Act
continues to be applicable to air carriers as Federal Common
Law."

     In petitioning for Supreme Court review, Burlington contends
that the Georgia ruling essentially renders the Airline
Deregulation Act void in that state.  "Moreover," the carrier
argues, "this interpretation gives a preference to shippers in
Georgia by allowing attorney fees which are not available to
shippers in other states.  This is contrary to all of the Airline
Deregulation Act provisions and purposes."

     Respondents are represented by Everett W. Gee III of Parker,
Johnson, Cook & Dunlevie in Atlanta.  Burlington is represented
by Fred C. Clark of Clark & Clark in Savannah.

FAA SAYS FEE AWARD TO
REINSTATED PILOT
WOULD BE UNJUSTIFIED

     In a Nov. 21 opposition brief filed with the District of
Columbia Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, the Federal Aviation
Administration contends that pilot Richard Rolund, whose
certificate was suspended for 90 days by the FAA but reinstated
by the National Transportation Safety Board, is not entitled to
an award of attorneys' fees.  Federal Aviation Administration v.
National Transportation Safety Board et al., No. 94-1428
(DC Cir.); see Aviation LR, Dec. 26, 1995.

     The FAA charged that Rolund, flying for Wings West Airlines,
used Visual Flight Rules (VFR) when visibility was less than
three miles, and descended to 2,100 feet despite being ordered by
a controller to stay at 2,500.

     The NTSB reversed the suspension order, and the FAA's
petition for reconsideration was denied.

     The DC Circuit affirmed, holding that the FAA clearly failed
to articulate its own interpretation of the rules while arguing "
for the first time " that the NTSB should defer to that
interpretation.  A reasonable Board might also conclude, the
panel held, that the FAA had not shown that ground visibility was
less than three miles when Rolund took off.  The appeals court
also cited evidence supporting the pilot's assertion that he did
not hear the altitude instruction.

     Rolund now seeks $26,503 in attorneys' fees from the FAA
under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA).  Under 28 U.S.C.
Section 2412, a prevailing party may be awarded fees and expenses
unless the position of the United States was substantially
justified or special circumstances make an award unjust.

     The FAA said it was substantially justified in seeking
review of the NTSB decision.  "The Board did not explicitly
reject as arbitrary or capricious the interpretation of the
regulations advanced by the FAA and affirmed by the ALJ at the
hearing; rather, the Board applied its own novel interpretation
of the regulations to the facts of the case.  The FAA took
exception, arguing that the Board's approach was inconsistent
with precedent and contrary to aviation safety," the FAA argued.

     "Accordingly, the FAA argued before this Court that the
Board erred in failing to defer to the FAA's interpretation of
the FAA safety regulations involved in the case."

     The FAA also said it was substantially justified in
believing that its interpretation of the regulations had been
raised before the NTSB.  Concerning the visibility at takeoff,
the FAA noted that its objection was to the Board's "novel
regulatory interpretation" that the official weather report was
not controlling as to ground visibility.

     "Accordingly," the brief stated, "the FAA was substantially
justified in advancing to this Court that the Board erred when it
failed to defer to the FAA's reasonable interpretation of the
regulation, as required by Board case law and 49 U.S.C. Section
44709(d)(3)."

     On the altitude change violation, the FAA argued that it was
advancing a long-standing interpretation of the applicable rule,
adopted through Board adjudication, which on its face requires
airmen to comply with a controller's instructions except in
emergency situations.  "The defense of 'I did not hear it' was
unacceptable in the absence of some reasonable explanation for
the communication not being 'hearable,' such as radio failure,"
the FAA contended.

     The FAA also said Rolund is seeking an unreasonable amount
of fees.

     Rolund claimed that the FAA's appeal was fatally flawed from
the outset, raising issues for the first time on appeal that the
agency had failed to consider in prior proceedings.  "It would be
difficult to conjure a more blatant abuse by the FAA of its duty
to consider the justification for its case.  This is exactly the
type of abuse which Congress intended to prevent by enacting the
EAJA," Rolund's fee application stated.

     The FAA is represented by Allan H. Horowitz and Clarence C.
Butcher Jr. of the FAA in Washington, DC.  Rolund is represented
by Mark T. McDermott and Peter J. Wiernicki of Joseph, Gajarsa,
McDermott & Reiner in Washington, DC.  On the original appeal,
Rolund was represented by John J. Veth of Speiser, Krause, Madole
& Cook in Irvine, CA; Gerard R. Lear and Rina M. Goodman of
Speiser, Krause, Madole & Lear in Rosslyn, VA; and John P. Burns
of Roger W. Calton & Associates in Laguna Niguel, CA.

INJURED PLAINTIFF WINS
$3.5 MILLION IN CA CRASH

     A California state court jury Dec. 15 awarded $3.5 million
to Michael Hamblin, injured in a plane crash that killed his
stepmother, DeAnna, and father, James, who was piloting the
aircraft.  Hamblin v. Redwood Aviation, Inc. et al., No. 206385
(CA Super. Ct., Sonoma Cty.).

     The jury apportioned 40% fault to James Hamblin, 40% to the
plane's owner and 20% to the aircraft lessee.

     The single-engine plane crashed in Lake County, CA, in 1992
after an engine valve failed.  Michael Hamblin suffered spinal
injuries and nerve damage.  He filed suit against the aircraft
owner, Falcon Aerial; the lessee, Aero Cartographics; maintenance
firm Redwood Aviation Inc.; valve manufacturer Superior Air Parts
Inc.; and the estate of James Hamblin, which held a financial
interest in Falcon and Aero.

     The parties disputed who was responsible for the faulty
valve.  After apportionment of fault, Michael Hamblin was awarded
$250,000 in economic damages, $1.25 million in general damages,
and $1 million awards for the wrongful deaths of James and DeAnna
Hamblin.  The three parties found at fault were covered by James
Hamblin's flight insurance policy.

     Michael Hamblin was represented by Warren Radler and George
Keller of Rivkin, Radler & Kremer in Santa Rosa, CA.  Falcon,
Aero and the James Hamblin estate were represented by James Irwin
of Irwin & Reilly in Los Angeles.  Redwood was represented by Lee
Danforth of Coddington, Hicks & Danforth in Redwood City, CA.
Superior was represented by J. Michael Bean of Maloney, Bean &
Horn in Irving, TX, and by Patrick Bailey, Maryann Marzano and

6TH CIRCUIT AFFIRMS
REVOCATION OF CERTIFICATE
FOR FALSIFIED APPLICATION

     A Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals panel Dec. 13 upheld
the revocation of petitioner Michael Manin's pilot and airman
medical certificates for his failure to disclose a federal
conviction, finding substantial evidence that Manin failed to
properly disclose a 1992 conviction for falsifying a passport
application.  Manin v. National Transportation Safety Board et
al., No. 95-3589 (6th Cir.).

     Manin's certificates were initially revoked by the Federal
Aviation Administration in 1991 for fraudulently and
intentionally falsifying his applications for the certificates.
The order was stayed pending an informal conference.  A second
revocation order was issued in 1994 because Manin falsely
certified the lack of convictions on his 1992 and 1993
applications.

     The National Transportation Safety Board affirmed the FAA
revocation and denied reconsideration.

     The Sixth Circuit affirmed, finding the NTSB decision
supported by substantial evidence that Manin had been federally
convicted before applying for his 1992 and 1993 certificates.
The panel also noted that Manin failed to perfect a timely appeal
of the 1991 revocation.

JAPAN BEGINS F-2 PRODUCTION IN $246-BILLION BUDGET PLAN

By:
EIICHIRO SEKIGAWA

(TOKYO)
Finance Minister Takemura Masayoshi has succeeded in reducing the Japanese
Defense Agency's budget to $246.6 billion, or $6 billion below the JDA's
request, but the new five-year plan will still offer 6.6% growth above
current spending levels.
The 1996-2000 procurement plan will include nearly $42 billion for major
weapon systems, but that is $1.57 billion less than the five-year plan just
ending.
   The cutbacks include a reduction in the total purchase of FS-X fighters
from the 141 recently sought by the air force to the 130 originally
planned.
   A close air support fighter based on the Lockheed Martin F-16C/D, the
FS-X has officially left the experimental stage and has been renamed the
F-2. It will replace the Mitsubishi F-1.
   THE AIR FORCE APPEARS to have staved off calls for F-2 production
numbers to drop as low as 80 to reflect a reduced threat in the post-Cold
War era. As part of its lobbying effort, the service pumped up its request
by 11 aircraft, ostensibly to benefit the Blue Impulse acrobatic team and
reserve forces. But the addition was padding, in part to make projected
unit costs look better. The first 12 production aircraft are expected to be
funded in fiscal 1996 and will cost about $120 million each. A full
procurement will reduce that number to about $80 million each.
   The F-2 flew for the first time in October. An entry into service is set
for 1999.
   The F-2 cutback was expected. A more interesting casualty was the air
force's proposal to introduce Japan's first airborne refueling and troop
transport aircraft, which would have given the Japanese the potential to
extend their air power for greater involvement in international
peacekeeping efforts.
   That proposal has been tabled, for the time being, but may be taken up
again in three years during a midterm review of the five-year defense
plan.
   The air force has tried for years to acquire tankers to extend the range
of its fighters for interdiction missions. But political constraints,
particularly from the Socialist and Communists parties, have blocked the
purchases out of concern that Asian nations would fear a resurgence of
Japanese nationalist aggression. The Socialists' objections, plus the
Finance Ministry's opposition because of the program's costs, have again
prevailed.
   Another casualty was a Defense Agency request for an advanced technology
fighter demonstrator. Lack of funds has reduced that effort to powerplant
studies. The JDA expects to revive the effort in the 2001-2005 budget
plan.
   The new force buildup is part of Japan's first rewrite of its military
strategy in 19 years. The new policy advocates smaller forces but says
Japan must help assure stability in East Asia. It also describes military
assistance in rescue missions, natural disaster relief and anti-terrorism
campaigns.
   The new plan does not call for additional Lockheed/Kawasaki P-3C
antisubmarine patrol aircraft. Instead, a replacement will be sought.
Besides an ASW role, the new aircraft is to have a capability for surface
tracking of ships as the navy picks up more roles traditionally reserved
for civilian authorities (in this case, smuggling and illegal
immigration).
   The P-3C multitask replacement aircraft is expected to be introduced
after the turn of the century.
   Left unmentioned is a replacement for the Mitsubishi T-2 trainer, a Mach
1.6 aircraft from which the F-1 was derived. The T-2's design service life
is nearly over. Between 1969 and 1986, Mitsubishi built 96 T-2s.
   The five-year plan calls for installation of advanced phased-array
radars built by Mitsubishi Electric for the F-15J. The same radar is to be
used in the F-2.
   At the navy's request, ShinMaywa is planning an improved US-1A amphibian
search-and-rescue aircraft with higher thrust engines. ShinMaywa has been
campaigning the US-1A for civilian applications throughout the Asia-Pacific
region.
   A replacement for the air force's 31 Kawasaki C-1 medium troop/cargo
transports also is being sought.
   Budget highlights:
  -- Although force consolidation prevails throughout the army, the
Paratroop Group, Helicopter Group and eight Hawk surface-to-air missile
groups remain as they are.
  -- The 12th Div. will be shifted from a ground force to an air mobile
force, signaling a need for a helicopter transport buildup.
  -- The navy's land-based antisubmarine warfare aircraft will be reduced
from 16 units to 13.
  -- The navy's tactical aircraft will be reduced from about 220 to 170.
  -- The air force's three F-2 fighter squadrons, reconnaissance unit,
three air transport units, AWACs patrols and six Patriot missile batteries
are retained as is.
  -- But one of today's 10 interceptor fighter forces will be eliminated.
  -- Tactical aircraft numbers will drop from 430 to 400, with a
corresponding drop in fighters from about 350 to 300.
  -- Personnel will be reduced in favor of automation at 20 of 28 air
defense radar sites.

NASA COUNTERS RUSSIAN PLAN TO CUT STATION COSTS

By:
JOSEPH C. ANSELMO

(WASHINGTON)
   NASA has rejected Russian Space Agency proposals to build the
international space station around Russia's orbiting Mir station, but has
countered with a proposal it believes would significantly reduce Moscow's
up-front commitment.
   During six days of meetings in Houston just before Christmas, NASA
officials outlined an ambitious, multifaceted plan to their Russian
counterparts that would allow the RSA to delay or modify its contribution
of several large components to the international project without
substantially altering the station's design or initial assembly schedule.
   The proposals would significantly reduce the number of Russian launches
during the initial assembly phase of the international station and allow
Mir to continue to be utilized for scientific missions until at least
2000.
   The Russian station, which was orbited in 1986, was scheduled to shut
down when assembly on the international station began in November, 1997.
But it has lasted longer than expected.
   Russian officials do not want to abandon Mir before its life ends, but
they also don't have the money or launch capability to conduct station
assembly flights and resupply Mir at the same time. That dilemma led to two
proposals the Russians made in Houston to connect the early elements of the
international station to Mir (AW&ST Dec. 11, 1995, p. 35).
   Among the key points in NASA's counterproposal, according to sources:
  -- Russia would build and launch the station service module on the third
assembly flight in April, 1998, as scheduled. RSA officials had proposed
delaying the module, which is critical to the station's early assembly
sequence, or making modifications that might cause a delay.
  -- Delivery of three Russian research modules and a Science Power
Platform (SPP) to power them would be delayed for several years. Roll
control that would have been provided to the station by the SPP could be
provided instead by a boom similar to the one that provides roll control on
Mir. NASA and RSA will also examine the feasibility of transferring two
newer Mir science modules, Spektr and Priroda, to the international station
in place of the brand new research modules.
   Orbiting and outfitting the SPP and its arrays would have required six
launches on Proton boosters, and the three research labs would have
required three additional launches. The substitute boom will require only
two Russian launches.
  -- Russian launches would be further reduced by using the space shuttle,
instead of Russia's Soyuz vehicle, for changing out crews after
human-tended capability is reached. NASA officials believe the shuttle can
accommodate the additional 1,800 lb. that would be added to station
assembly flights to transport crews. Russian cosmonaut requirements on the
international station would also be reduced until its research modules were
delivered.
  -- NASA's Mission Control Center at Johnson Space Center would expand
its role during the assembly sequence. RSA officials had said their control
center in Moscow would be overburdened handling both its share of station
assembly and Mir.
  -- NASA will consider extending ``Phase 1'' scientific and engineering
experiments on Mir into 1998 or 1999, which would mean increased payment to
Moscow for ``rent'' of the facility.
   Russian officials had complained they were responsible for too much of
the early elements of station assembly. NASA's plan is aimed at
significantly delaying much of that contribution without affecting the
design or assembly of U.S., European, Japanese or Canadian components.
Russia is not the first station partner with money problems. In fact, Japan
is the only one that has not reduced its commitment.
   IN RELATED NEWS, prime station contractor Boeing said damage to a flight
article for the FGB space tug--which is being paid for by NASA but is
scheduled to be built and launched by Russia--will not delay its planned
launch in November, 1997, as the first station element.
   Boeing said an error by a Russian test operator caused a pressure
differential that damaged the FGB's internal bulkhead and elements of three
forward sections of its pressurized instrument module.

BOEING MOVES AHEAD WITH SEA LAUNCH VENTURE

By:
JOSEPH C. ANSELMO

(WASHINGTON)
A hefty order from Hughes and a key regulatory go-ahead from the U.S.
government has allowed Boeing to move full speed ahead with a unique
international partnership to launch payloads from a sea-based platform.
   The Sea Launch venture between Boeing, Russia's RSC Energia, Ukraine's
NPO Yuzhnoye and Kvaerner Group, a Norwegian ship builder, was first made
public last April (AW&ST Apr. 17, 1995, p. 25).
   Boeing officials, however, had been unclear for several months whether
the U.S. government would permit them to conduct enough launches to make
the $500-million venture commercially viable.
   Approval finally came last month, when the Clinton Administration gave
Sea Launch permission to conduct at least 11 geosynchronous launches and
possibly 14 through the end of 2001 as part of a launch agreement with
Ukraine (AW&ST Dec. 18/25, 1995, p. 97).
   THE ADMINISTRATION decided to fold Sea Launch into the agreement because
it will employ two stages from Ukraine's Zenit booster. Boeing had objected
to being covered under the Ukrainian quotas. But company officials now say
they can live with the number of launches they have been allowed.
   Another key piece of the puzzle fell into place last month with the
finalization of a commitment from Hughes Space and Communications to
purchase at least 10 launches. That deal, worth about $1 billion with
options, provided Boeing and its partners with the financial impetus to
proceed.
   The launch venture is also discussing launch services with another U.S.
satellite manufacturer and hopes to announce a deal within two months,
according to Sea Launch President Ronald C. Olson.
   Sea Launch plans to use a complex mix of booster components and support
equipment from around the globe to offer launch services from a converted
31,000-ton North Sea oil rig.
   Besides the two stages from Ukraine's Zenit booster, the venture plans
to use a Russian Block DM upper stage. The stages would be shipped
piecemeal to the U.S., where they would be integrated with American-built
fairings and adaptors. Launches would take place in the Pacific Ocean in
international waters south of Hawaii.
   The oil rig is currently being converted to a launch platform in Norway,
while a Sea Launch command and control ship is under construction at a
shipyard in Scotland.
   Sea Launch plans to orbit its first payload, a yet-to-be-designated
Hughes satellite, in 1998. The venture plans at least one other launch that
year, and ultimately hopes to ramp up to 6-8 launches a year, Olson said.
   The Sea Launch booster is designed to carry 12,000 lb. of payload to
geosynchronous orbit. That would allow it to orbit a next-generation Hughes
HS-702 satellite with room to spare for a smaller, piggybacked payload.
   Olson said he believes his company's main competitor will be Europe's
Arianespace consortium.
   ``We're not going after [U.S.] government or NASA business,'' he said.
``Our goal is to take market share away from Arianespace. Right now they
enjoy about 60% of the market share. We'd like to get that percentage back
in the United States.''
Olson said Boeing will hold the largest share of Sea Launch, 40%, while
Russia's RSC Energia will hold a 25% share, the Norwegian Kvaerner Group a
20% stake and Ukraine's NPO Yuzhnoye 15%.
   Energia's share is larger than Yuzhnoye's because 60% of the Zenit's
components actually come from Russia, including its Energomash-supplied
engines, Olson said.
   He said Sea Launch is negotiating to establish a ``home port'' for its
ship and an assembly facility in Long Beach, Calif.

RADARSAT DELIVERS FIRST SAR IMAGE

By:
DAVID HUGHES

(BOSTON)
Canada's Radarsat 1 satellite has delivered its first data for an image
using a synthetic aperture radar to survey Cape Breton Island in Nova
Scotia at night through cloud cover and rain.
   Data for the first image released last month was gathered in late
November. It is possible to see the effects of high winds on the water
surface since the waves generated strong radar returns (see bright area in
upper left of image). The image covers an area 132-km. wide and it was
taken from an altitude of 156 km.
   Dennis M. Nazarenko, manager of application solutions at Radarsat
International, said the images are close to specifications. The satellite
is not in its final orbit yet, and data-processing software is still being
fine-tuned.
   John Hornsby, Radarsat International's director of operations, said the
company is still in the early phase of commissioning the satellite, which
will take about three months. Radarsat expects to begin providing images
for commercial use in mid-February. The satellite was launched on Nov. 4.
   Radarsat plans to certify ground stations in Norway, the United Kingdom
and Singapore after tests of acquisition and processing capabilities
starting early this month. Hornsby said he expects a number of other ground
stations to come on line in 1996. Stations may be commissioned in
Australia, Africa and Brazil, and there is also interest in China and
Japan.
   Hornsby said Radarsat International is already studying possible
improvements that might be made in a second satellite. Some long lead time
hardware will probably be ordered for Radarsat 2 later this year.
   Radarsat International worked with Spar Aerospace Ltd. to design, build
and launch the satellite under the aegis of the Canadian Space Agency. Ball
Aerospace & Technologies Corp. built the spacecraft bus.

ATLAS SETS RECORD

(CAPE CANAVERAL)
Lockheed Martin capped a record year of space launches in 1995 when its
Atlas-Centaur successfully orbited Hughes' Galaxy 3R satellite to serve the
direct-to-home television market throughout Latin America.
   Atlas-Centaur 120 lifted off Pad 36A here on time at 1923 EST, Dec. 14.
The Atlas 2A vehicle had a smooth ascent, and about 29 min. after launch
the Centaur upper stage separated to leave the HS-601 satellite in its
geosynchronous transfer orbit.
   The launch was the 11th of an Atlas-Centaur vehicle from Complex 36 here
in 1995. That was the most Atlases ever launched in one year.
   Hughes Space and Communications Co. engineers took more than 4 hr. to
gain full communications with the spacecraft after it reached that orbit.
Hughes officials were unavailable to explain the delay.
   The satellite was expected to take about 10 days to maneuver to its
geosynchronous station at 95 W. Long., after which it is to undergo several
weeks of testing before becoming operational in January.
   Galaxy 3R has 24 C-band transponders that will be used to provide
broadcast programming to the continental U.S. It also has 24 Ku-band
transponders that will be used by Galaxy Latin America to deliver DirecTV
entertainment programming to Mexico, Central and South America, and the
Caribbean. Galaxy Latin America is a joint venture of Hughes firms in
Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil.

MILSTAR COMPLETES FIRST CROSS-LINK TRANSMISSION

(LOS ANGELES)
The Milstar satellite system has made its first cross-link communication by
transmitting a message from one Milstar spacecraft to another without the
use of a ground relay facility.
   The cross-link capability supports the existing Milstar low data rate
payload and the planned medium data rate system being developed for Block 2
Milstars.
   Cross-linking enables a message to be routed around the Milstar
satellite constellation for downlink to a destination terminal. The system
provides secure inter-satellite communications by using specific
frequencies and high-gain, narrow-beam antennas, program officials said.
   The first cross-linked message was uplinked from the Military Command
Center in Virginia Dec. 15 through the first Milstar satellite, development
flight satellite-1 (DFS-1), which was placed in orbit in February, 1994.
The message then was relayed directly to the second of two Block 1
spacecraft launched in November. Development flight satellite-2 downlinked
the message to Pacific Command in Hawaii.
   The two spacecraft combined have a cross-link coverage extending from
Europe and Africa to beyond the Hawaiian Islands, program officials said.
   Milstar's cross-linking capability is intended to provide a worldwide
communications capability when the constellation is completed around the
turn of the century, with four spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit, program
officials said.
   The third spacecraft is scheduled to be completed in 1998, while the
last three Milstar 2s are set for delivery in 1999, 2000 and 2001.
   The medium data rate payload was added to Block 2 satellites as a result
of a program restructuring in 1991. Lockheed Martin is prime contractor for
Milstar. TRW and Hughes provide the low and medium data rate payloads,
respectively.

EUROPEAN AIRFRAMERS MERGE TO BUILD MUSCLE
Aerospatiale, Alenia and British Aerospace forming Aero International
Regional to position themselves for the future in an overcrowded regional
aircraft market

By:
PIERRE SPARACO

(TOULOUSE)
   Aero International Regional, a company jointly established by
Aerospatiale, Alenia and British Aerospace, is paving the way for a major
consolidation in the regional aircraft market.
   AIR will be formed this week to streamline the three partners' wide
range of 29-115-seat regional commercial transports. In the long term, AIR
plans to launch all-new aircraft, although no specific timeframe has been
determined yet.
   Aerospatiale, Alenia and British Aerospace each own a 33.3% stake in
AIR, a company headquartered in Toulouse.
   ``A major European [aircraft manufacturer] is born. The joint venture is
open to new partners, European and from outside Europe,'' AIR Chief
Executive Officer Henri-Paul Puel said.
   AIR, although not expected to cut excess production capacity soon, is
paving the way for a unified organization holding a major share in the
regional aircraft market. However, Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA) and
Fokker, its Dutch affiliate, are not involved and remain AIR's competitors,
as does Sweden's Saab-Scania, a stand-alone regional aircraft producer.
   ``AIR's doors are wide open to welcome DASA. We cannot envisage building
[regional transports] in Europe without the Germans,'' Puel said.
``However, I am not sure Fokker still does exist,'' he cynically added,
referring to the Dutch manufacturer's deep financial difficulties.
   During the next 2-4 years, AIR's priority will be to market and support
existing products still manufactured by the founding partners, including
enhanced derivatives. In the U.S., AIR Marketing Inc. of Chantilly, Va.,
will succeed ATR's North American sales branch. Product support will be
handled by AIR Support Inc. of Sterling, Va.
AIR's product range comprises:
  -- Jetstream twin turboprops. Jetstream Aircraft, a Scotland-based
British Aerospace subsidiary, is producing the 29-seat Jetstream 41 twin
turboprop transport. Jetstream concluded orders for 103 41s and delivered
67 aircraft to eight operators in 1995. Although the 19-seat Jetstream 31
is still being marketed, production was recently terminated and additional
aircraft will now be manufactured to order only.
  -- ATR twin turboprops. Avions de Transport Regional, a Toulouse-based
Aerospatiale-Alenia consortium, is producing 48-66-seat ATR42/72 twin
turboprop transports and enhanced derivatives such as the higher
performance ATR42-500. ATR has received orders for 290 ATR42s and delivered
284 aircraft. The consortium sold 172 ATR72s and delivered 160 aircraft.
Late last month, the combined ATR42/72 backlog was only 18 aircraft, a low
level tied to weak sales in 1995. However, major orders are currently being
negotiated, Puel claimed.
  -- Avro jet transports. Woodford-based Avro International Aerospace,
also a British Aerospace subsidiary, produces 70-115-seat, four-engine
RJ70, RJ85, RJ100 and RJ115 transports. In 1993, the enhanced RJ line
succeeded British Aerospace BAe-146 models with the same capacities. Avro
has received orders for 95 RJs and delivered 46 aircraft.
   THIS YEAR, THE AIR partners plan to produce about 100 aircraft,
comprising 25 Jetstream 41s, 25 RJs and 50 ATRs, generating sales estimated
at $1.2 billion, Puel said.
   This week, AIR will establish an integrated management staff, located in
ATR's corporate headquarters building next to Toulouse airport. The
French-based management, marketing and product support services will have
about 700 employees. In addition, nearly 100 employees will be based in
Italy, 50 in the U.S. and 50 in the Pacific Rim. The integration is
scheduled to extend over the 1996-98 period, company officials said.
   The three partners' product support activities are scheduled to be
combined on June 1. By the end of the year, unified spare part activities
will be established at Weybridge in the U.K. Training facilities, including
flight simulators, will be transferred gradually to Naples, Italy.
   NEARLY 200 CARRIERS around the world currently operate more than 1,450
aircraft produced by AIR's partners. ATR, Jetstream and Avro delivered more
than 1,200 regional aircraft. In addition, AIR will also support earlier
aircraft types such as 50-seat Hawker Siddeley HS-748s, 70-seat British
Aerospace Jetstream 61s/ATPs and 19-seat Jetstream 31s, an AIR official
said.
   The new company's scope is scheduled to expand broadly when all-new
programs are launched. Before the agreement to form AIR, ATR planned to
develop an 80-seat twin turboprop transport, known as the ATR82. And Avro
was considering a twinjet derivative of the RJ, expected to be equipped
with CFM56 Lite turbofan engines planned by CFM International, a General
Electric-Snecma joint company. Such new concepts are now scheduled to be
replaced by AIR-developed aircraft.
   Launching an all-new, 100-seat twinjet could become AIR's first major
initiative, company officials acknowledged. However, the future of such a
concept is tied to the outcome of the proposed AE-100 Asian Express
program. Aviation Industries of China (AVIC) and the Korean Commercial
Aircraft Development Consortium (KCDC) have not decided yet on a Western
partner for the 100-seat-category twinjet (AW&ST Oct. 16, 1995, p. 23).
   Last month, AIR formed Beijing-based Aero International Asia. DASA and
Fokker are promoting a rival concept, and two U.S. manufacturers, Boeing
and McDonnell Douglas, also submitted offerings.
   AVIC and KCDC planned to select a Western partner in September, but
delayed their decision and are now planning a two-step selection procedure.
Two finalists are expected to be retained, and the winner will be selected
a few weeks later.
   AVIC and KCDC plan to offer a 5-6% share in the AE-100 to an additional
partner, Singapore Aerospace or Hindustan Aeronautics, before the program
is formally launched.
   ``If a U.S. manufacturer wins, the Europeans will think seriously about
launching their own [100-seat twinjet] program,'' Antonio Di Blasi said. He
is AIR senior vice president-projects and strategic marketing.
   At this stage, the planned AE-100 program is resulting in increasingly
complex issues. Chinese and Korean industry officials apparently
underestimated the numerous problems that must be resolved before such a
global undertaking can materialize, a French official pointed out. In
addition, Alenia, AIR's Italian arm, is a risk-sharing partner in the newly
launched 100-seat McDonnell Douglas MD-95 twinjet transport.
   The AE-100's basic model, a 108-seat aircraft, will be followed by a
shortened, 95-seat derivative and a stretched, 137-seat version, AVIC
Managing Director Gao Zhanmin recently said. The twinjet, as currently
envisioned by AVIC's Beijing-based engineering team, would have a
50-metric-ton (110,000-lb.) maximum takeoff weight, Mach 0.78 cruise speed
and 1,500-km. (810-naut.-mi.) range at maximum payload. No engine type has
been specified yet.
   According to a French industry official, an all-new 100-seat twinjet
will be economically justified if it can offer direct operating costs at
least 10% below those of existing aircraft such as the Fokker 100 and the
Avro RJ or newly-launched programs--Boeing's 737-600 and McDonnell Douglas'
MD-95.
   AIR participants are considering a five-abreast cabin configuration. The
resulting aircraft would not compete with the wider-fuselage, 124-seat
A319, the Airbus Industrie consortium's smallest aircraft, the French
official said.

aircraft manufacturers from Europe and elsewhere. They specifically

NEW RUSSIAN MIGS SET FOR FLIGHT TEST

By:
NICOLAY NOVICHKOV
CRAIG COVAULT

(MOSCOWPARIS)
The Russian Mikoyan design bureau, now being merged into the MAPO-MiG
industrial group, opens 1996 preparing for the first flights of both its
advanced fighter and MiG-AT trainer.
   The imminent flights will mark the first completely new aircraft to be
tested by the famed Mikoyan organization since the MiG-29 first flew 15
years ago.
   Mikoyan officials are planning the AT's scheduled first takeoff by Jan.
20 and the new fighter's initial flight also early this year.
   The tests will be conducted at the Ramenskoye Flight Test Center near
Moscow, where the aircraft were making final high-speed taxi runs in late
December. Mikoyan chief test pilot, Taskayev Roman, will fly both
aircraft.
   In addition to the initial flights with the new fighter and trainer,
MAPO-MiG will accelerate midair refueling tests with MiG-29M aircraft,
which earlier could not be refueled in flight. The Russian air force hopes
to buy 30 MiG-29Ms with the new refueling capability this year.
   MAPO-MiG also plans to redesignate newer versions of the MiG-29M as the
MiG-33, although there will be no differences in flight hardware between
the two designations.
   The revival of MiG flight test activity is being aided by a rejuvenated
Mikoyan financial/industrial base. The new business foundation stems from
the design bureau's merger with MAPO, the Moscow Aircraft Production
Organization that built MiG aircraft during the Soviet era. Several banks
are also part of the organization, which has been designated a
``financial/industrial group'' under Russian law.
   Vladimir Kuzmin, who earlier headed MAPO, is director general of the new
organization. He shares some of that overall responsibility with Rostislav
Belyakov, who headed Mikoyan as its general designer. Belyakov, who has
been battling ill health, has a direct management line to the head of
design/development, Anatoliy Belosvet.
   A recent influx of funding from the Russian Ministry of Defense for
flight test of the new advanced fighter will also help the company, Russian
sources said.
   The aircraft, informally called the MiG-1.42, carries the official
designation of MFI (loosely translated as ``multifunction fighter''). The
twin-engine MFI is designed to be both a military and commercial competitor
to the Lockheed Martin F-22, the Eurofighter 2000 and the Dassault Rafale.
The Russian aircraft has 16 control surfaces, including canards and a twin
tail, that are driven by a fly-by-wire system. It was initially to have
flown in 1995, but funding problems and the need to conduct further testing
on control system actuators pushed the scheduled first flight into early
1996.
   The aircraft is to have supersonic cruise (``supercruise'') capability
and limited stealth characteristics.
   If the fighter has a successful flight test program, it would not enter
service until after 2000. In contrast, the new MiG-AT trainer would begin
field evaluations at a Russian air force school within a few months of its
initial flight, if selected by the Defense Ministry over the Yakovlev Yak/
AEM-130, a competing trainer.
   Through late December, the AT had completed at least five high-speed
taxi tests. Like the new fighter, the AT was to have flown in 1995 but was
slowed by funding delays.
   Russia plans to buy 250-300 trainers to replace its current Czech-built
L -29 and L-39 aircraft. The winner will also have export opportunities,
and already India and Uzbekistan have signed options to procure the new
trainer.
   MAPO-MiG IS WORKING with France's Snecma and Turbomeca, which will
supply the AT's twin Larzac engines. Export versions, to be marketed by
Snecma, would also have a Sextant Avionique/Gosniias glass cockpit.
Yakovlev is teamed with Italy's Aermacchi for development of the
Yak/AEM-130, which has a fly-by-wire control system and two Klimov turbofan
engines (AW&ST June 26, 1995, p. 26).
   Details emerging from the Russian Defense Ministry indicated a split
over which aircraft is favored. At least some senior air force managers
have expressed a preference for the Yak/AEM-130, but Russian Air Defense
Force (PVO) officers earlier liked the MiG-AT (AW&ST Sept. 12, 1994, p.
43).
   While the MiG-AT is set to fly by Jan. 20, the Yak/AEM-130 will not make
its first flight until well into 1996, Russian sources said. No decision
will be made until after flight tests begin, but it could come relatively
early in the flight test phase, they said.
   Yakovlev will test a single aircraft, but MAPO-MiG officials believe a
plan to ``field-test'' several ATs in parallel with traditional flight
testing will work to their advantage in the Defense Ministry's decision.
Under the plan, MAPO-MiG would produce 15 ATs in 1996 and provide 5-7 of
them immediately to one of the four Russian air force flight training
schools.
   MiG engineers believe another factor in their favor is that the initial
flight test aircraft is composed of 25% ``serial'' components and structure
identical to and off the same tooling that would be used for production
aircraft. This 25% includes the horizontal stabilizer and the wing with its
integral fuel tanks.
   The second MiG-AT is in advanced fabrication and will have 50% of its
structure as serial components. The third aircraft will be the same as
production versions from a design and production tooling standpoint.
   These first three aircraft would all go into the AT flight test program
at Ramenskoye, while the fourth aircraft would be devoted to static loads
testing.
   If selected by the Russian government, MAPO-MiG would produce 35 ATs in
1997 and 50 in 1998. The company believes there is global market potential
for about 1,200 AT aircraft.
   While testing the new fighter and trainer, MAPO-MiG this year will also
increase testing of the MiG-29M--to be redesignated the MiG-33. The
evaluations will continue new air refueling system development begun in
late 1995 and tests of the aircraft using laser-guided bombs.
   Recent weapon tests with laser-guided bombs indicate that the
MiG-29M/MiG-33 radar has the capability to acquire a ground target at
ranges up to 50 km. (31 mi.), a distance greater than earlier tests
indicated. The aircraft can then use its own laser designator, or a laser
designation by ground forces, to guide the weapon once it is dropped.
   WHILE THE NEW PROGRAMS show that the Russian air force is trying to
maintain advanced developments, the air force budget will have to be
increased significantly if any of these aircraft are to be placed in
production.
   During all of 1995, for example, the air force ordered only 15 new
aircraft including helicopters. Of these, only two were fighters.
   Last year, MAPO-MiG built 35 of the standard MiG-29 version, and none
were delivered to the Russian air force. Seven of the aircraft were
delivered to Slovakia and 10 to Hungary in exchange for Russian debt
relief.
   The only funded MiG-29 deliveries were to Malaysia, which received 18 in
1995. An additional 18 MiG-29s are expected to be ordered by Malaysia under
a new procurement cycle that begins this year (AW&ST Dec. 18/25, 1995, p.
12).

FIRST FLIGHT OF C-130J DELAYED

(MELBOURNE, FLA.)
   Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems has delayed first flight of the
C-130J by about a month to complete functional testing and debugging of the
new, software-laden transport's systems.
   Program managers had expected to have run C-130J No. 1's Allison
AE2100D3 engines, with their six-bladed Dowty Aerospace R391 propellers, by
mid-December. While the aircraft had been fueled, the engines had not been
run by Dec. 21.
   Low-speed taxi tests were delayed, as was the first flight, which
tentatively had been scheduled for about Dec. 27. That flight is now
targeted for the second half of this month.
   In addition to the enhanced performance that the Allison/Dowty
powerplant provides, the C-130J uses fully integrated digital avionics
built around 10 Mil-Std 1553B data buses and two mission computers.
   The aircraft also has a two-pilot flight deck with a front panel of four
large and five smaller liquid crystal displays and two Flight Dynamics
head-up primary flight instrument displays.
   Countering the testing setback was the Royal Australian Air Force's
order for 12 C-130Js, with options to buy more. The C-130Js are to replace
the RAAF's 12 C-130Es. Additional aircraft could be used for tanker and
airborne early warning missions and for the eventual replacement of the air
force's 12 C-130Hs.
   The $670-million contract calls for Lockheed to deliver the aircraft
over the next five years.
   ``This is an important signing for the C-130J,'' said Al Hansen,
executive vice president for Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems. ``Many
customers in the Asia-Pacific area use the Royal Australian Air Force as a
guide in ordering their own equipment.''
The Australian contract brings the number of C-130Js ordered this year to
39.
   The No. 1 test aircraft is the first of 25 stretched -30 versions of the
C-130J that Lockheed Martin is building for the United Kingdom's Royal Air
Force. The U.S. Air Force also has ordered two standard-length C-130Js.
   Aircraft No.1's first flight is to launch a test program of about 1,000
flight hours. The second and third aircraft are to join the flight test
program next month, with a fourth and fifth coming on line in March.

AGM-130 SEEKER TESTED

(BOSTON)
   The U.S. Air Force and Rockwell International have successfully tested a
new infrared seeker on the precision-guided, rocket-propelled AGM-130 that
can be launched at a target from more than 40 mi. away.
   AGM-130s with television seekers or an earlier-generation scanning
infrared seeker are now in the U.S. Air Force weapons inventory and could
be used in Bosnia if needed. The weapon was just entering service during
Desert Storm and was not used in that conflict. The AGM-130 has either a
2,000-lb. blast/fragmentation warhead or a similar weight penetrating bomb
with a forged steel case. It can be dropped from as low as 200 ft. to hit
targets 15 mi. away, or from altitudes of more than 30,000 ft. to hit
targets more than 40 mi. away.
   When it is dropped at 200 ft., the rocket motor boosts the weapon up to
a cruising altitude of 1,000 to 2,000 ft. After rocket burnout, the weapon
glides to its target. An aircraft might fly low to hide behind terrain or
fly high and stand off at a considerable distance from the target.
   After launch from an F-15E or an F-111, the bomb glides for a while and
then is boosted by a rocket motor. The motor drops off after it is expended
and the weapon continues to glide. An INS/GPS unit puts the weapon in the
correct position about 15 sec. before impact for a weapon system operator
in the fighter aircraft to guide it in manually using imagery from the
television or infrared seeker.
   The seeker tested late last year at Eglin AFB, Fla., is a staring focal
plane array made of mercury cadmium telluride with 256 X 256 elements. It
was produced by Rockwell's Autonetics & Missile Systems Div. The staring
focal plane array is interchangeable with the charged coupled device camera
used in the weapon. The new seeker has a cryogenic cooling subsystem.
   The test at Eglin involved an F-15E dropping a Rockwell AGM-130 while
flying at 480 KTAS at an altitude of 2,000 ft. The aircraft was 14.2 n.m.
from the target and the weapon made a direct hit. A Rockwell official said
the new infrared seeker has greatly improved sensitivity and performs
better in adverse weather conditions.

ALCATEL PICKS MATRA FOR WORLDSPACE SATELLITE

By:
CRAIG COVAULT

(PARIS)
Matra Marconi Space will build three new communications satellites for the
space segment of the $600-million WorldSpace/Alcatel digital radio
broadcast system to serve Africa, South America and Asia.
   The WorldSpace/ Alcatel system could revolutionize the way radio
broadcasting is conducted around the world.
   The WorldSpace system is specifically geared to bring digital radio
services, including programs by international broadcasters such as the
Voice of America, to 3.5 billion people living in developing nations.
   Alcatel Espace of Paris is the prime contractor for the WorldSpace
organization, based in Washington. Matra Marconi will be Alcatel's major
subcontractor in the project.
   IN ADDITION TO coordinating the space segment, Alcatel will build the
advanced broadcast system to be integrated with all three Matra satellites.
This system will include the On-Board Baseband Processor (OBP) on each
satellite that will continually switch among dozens of radio
uplink/downlink channels.
   WorldSpace secured up to $650 million in financing for the long-term
project and signed Alcatel to an overall contract worth $600 million.
   The initial down payment on that contract enabled Alcatel in late
December to select Matra Marconi for a contract worth $100-150 million to
develop the initial three satellites.
   Matra was selected over Aerospatiale, Alenia and Space Systems/Loral.
Alcatel had in fact negotiated complete (but unsigned) contracts with all
four competitors before selecting a final bidder, according to Francis
Fraikin, Alcatel's director of commercial telecommunications.
   The first spacecraft, designated AfriStar-1, is to be launched in
mid-1998, and placed in geosynchronous orbit over Africa at 21 deg. E.
Long. From that location, its three spot beams will cover all of Africa,
Turkey and the Middle East.
   Two additional spacecraft are to be launched by mid-1999. The second
satellite will be CaribStar-1, to be positioned over the Pacific off South
America at 95 deg. W. Long. Its spot beams will cover all of Mexico and
Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean.
   The third satellite, AsiaStar-1, will be positioned at 105 deg. W.
Long., where it could beam radio broadcasts into all of India, southern and
eastern China and the entire Pacific basin.
   Each of the 2.7-metric-ton advanced Eurostar-type spacecraft will have a
5.5-kw. power capability and a planned orbital lifetime of 15 years.
   Much of the area to be served by the WorldSpace system now relies on
antiquated shortwave broadcasts. The three satellites will enable both
locally based broadcasters, as well as major ``world service'' networks, to
beam high-quality signals to millions of square miles of rugged terrain
with minimal ground infrastructure.
   Each spacecraft will have 288 standard ``voice'' channels that can be
combined by the OBP system into 144 individual ``monoaural-music'' channels
or 72 high-quality channels that can provide music with compact disc (CD)
quality. Stations using the satellites will be able to mix and match
channel needs, depending upon their broadcast plans each day. The OBP
system will make the proper allocations on board the satellite.
   The three satellites combined will have 216 CD-quality channels.
WorldSpace will offer 126 of these for sale to international and national
broadcasters. The Voice of America and Holland's Radio Nederland have
already signed up for this service. The remaining 90 channels will be
reserved for ``pay-radio'' services. WorldSpace is also selecting companies
to build the system's small, low-cost radios.
   ALCATEL MANAGERS VIEW the program as vital to positioning the company as
a full satellite service provider in the 21st century, Fraikin said.
   Alcatel is also completing contract arrangements with GE Americom,
Princeton, N. J., for the separate $240-million ``Starsys'' program in
which Alcatel would provide the GE unit with up to 24 small satellites to
track vehicle fleets.
   A contract for the first six satellites and their launch costs would be
worth about $100 million, according to Norbert Lannelongue, Alcatel
director of Observation Sciences.
   The major new element for Alcatel is to jump from the role of providing
just a communications payload for a satellite to the new, higher level of
providing a complete telecommunications system that includes the
satellites, ground system and revenue generating services, Fraikin said.
   ``We are alone in Europe as a company that is both in the satellite
business and is also a telecommunications company,'' he said.

USAF STEPS UP PACE OF BOSNIA AIRLIFT

By:
DAVID HUGHES

(BOSTON)
The U.S. Air Force intensified the pace of air operations into Bosnia and
Hungary over the Christmas holidays, taking advantage of good weather by
conducting 50-60 flights a day to four airfields in the theater.
   The weather cleared on Dec. 21 after several days of low clouds and fog,
and the Air Force was able to operate nearly 100 C-130 and C-17 missions
into Tuzla by Christmas day. As of Dec. 27, there had been a total of 164
missions flown to Tuzla carrying 1,235 tons of cargo. Other destinations
served include Sarajevo, Zagreb and Taszar in Hungary.
   C-141s began flying into Bosnia on Christmas eve, when the first
Starlifter touched down at Tuzla. This aircraft was operated by the 16th
Airlift Sqdn. at Charleston, S.C., the only -141 unit with a special
operations mission. The pilots are trained in low-level navigation and in
the use of night vision goggles but did not need these special procedures
at Tuzla. The airport is now equipped with TACAN and with precision
approach radar (PAR).
   The first C-17 to land at Tuzla arrived on Dec. 19 with a self-propelled
155-mm. howitzer, a support vehicle and trailer. Prior to Dec. 8, when a
C-17 landed at Sarajevo carrying humanitarian supplies, the aircraft had
not participated in any U.S. airlift operations into Bosnia. The C-17 can
carry four times the payload of the C-130.
   As of Dec. 26, the C-17 provided lift for more passengers and cargo in
support of Operation Joint Endeavor than C-5s or C-141s (see chart below).
C-130s from Air Combat Command logged 242 missions in support of the
operation and carried 1,269 passengers and 2,221 tons of cargo as of Dec.
28.
   Twelve C-17s have deployed from Charleston AFB, to Rhein Main AB in
Germany to support Bosnia operations. Tuzla can only accommodate one C-17
(or one C-141) in addition to 3 C-130s on the ground at the same time.
   Air Force Mission Planning System computers were airlifted by C-17s to
Europe. This system built by Sanders is being used to plan C-17 routes into
Bosnian airports and creating mission profiles.

F-16S UPGRADED FOR BOSNIA CAS ROLE

By:
JAMES T. McKENNA

(MELBOURNE, FLA.)
Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Services technicians have completed a
rush installation of upgraded modems in 38 Block 40 F-16s to improve the
aircraft's close-air support capabilities for NATO operations in Bosnia.
   Developed by the Naval Research Laboratory and produced by Symetrics
Industries Inc. here, the Improved Data Modems (IDMs) are designed to
increase the interoperability of units from the various U.S. military
services in combat. The high-speed, burst data modem shifts frequencies to
frustrate interception and jamming and is capable of translating
communications transmitted in various military protocols, such as the U.S.
Air Force's AFAPD, the Army's TACFIRE and the Navy/Marine Corps MTS.
   Each of the modem's two digital signal processors can handle two
channels, working with the aircraft's ARC 164 UHF HQII and ARC 186 radios.
When wired into the aircraft, the modem permits the pilot to receive voice
and data communications simultaneously on a single radio channel.
   The modem also includes a generic interface processor, a power converter
card and a KY58 encryption device.
   The modems already are in use supporting the
suppression-of-enemy-air-defenses capabilities of Block 50 F-16s.
   Lockheed Martin and Symetrics responded to an Air Force request to
quickly equip the Block 40 F-16s slated for close-air support (CAS)
missions in Bosnia. Symetrics' workers produced 41 IDMs in 30 days, and the
Lockheed Martin technicians installed the units in 36 aircraft at Aviano
AB, Italy, and two at Hill AFB.
   The effort, dubbed Project Sure Strike, is intended in part to
demonstrate the ability to meld the IDM's capabilities with those of the
CAS Integrated Targeting System. That system consists of a Mark 7 laser
targeting, the AN/PSN-11 precision lightweight GPS receiver, a Litton
Hand-held Terminal Unit and a Magnavox AN/PRC-113 VHF/UHF radio.
   The system is intended to allow ground troops to precisely guide the
Block 40 F-16 pilots to their CAS targets.
   The modems on the aircraft are designed to handle both digital and
analog data and voice traffic through the F-16's installed radios,
according to Jerry L. Sinclair, vice president of programs at Symetrics.
   THE CURRENT INSTALLATION on the Block 40 F-16s restricts communications
to TACFIRE communications, which is the protocol for the CAS Integrated
Targeting System. The aircraft operational flight programming must be
altered before takeoff if the mission calls for another protocol. The SEAD
Block 50 F-16s have the capability to switch protocols on the fly.
   The IDM passes signals from the ARC 164 or 186 radio over a Mil-Std 1553
bus to the aircraft's fire control unit and to the pilot's HUD, where the
signal generates a target-designator box. The pilot can store up to five
IDM targets and store or ignore IDM messages.

CROATS PONDER EARLY PUSH INTO EASTERN SLAVONIA

By:
DAVID A. FULGHUM

(WASHINGTON)
Croatian leaders are believed to be weighing their army's chances of
recapturing eastern Slavonia--possibly between mid-January and
mid-March--instead of waiting for up to two years for a Serb pullout
envisioned in the current regional peace plans.
   In order to derail an offensive, senior U.S. defense officials say NATO
forces will be very aggressive and intrusive in their aerial reconnaissance
of the region and will move quickly and with great force to derail any
preparations for renewed conflict. The contested portion of Croatia is
bordered by Hungary on the north, Serbia on the east and Croatia on the
south and west.
   ``We don't think the Croats have made the decision [to attack] yet, but
it is one of their serious planning options,'' a senior U.S. defense
official said.
   Croat leaders could be tempted to launch an offensive for a variety of
weather-related, military and political reasons, according to
Washington-based defense officials. Analyses show the initial key danger
period will run from the final pullout of United Nations' force in
mid-January until the region's spring thaw, probably in mid-March.
   KEY MANEUVER AREAS for tanks and other vehicles in the northern part of
Slavonia--the only remaining occupied area of Croatia, earlier known as
United Nations Sector East--are swamps that will only support motorized
traffic while frozen, U.S. officials point out. After the thaw, the Croats'
slashing style of attack--involving armored spearheads and fast-moving
columns of mobile troops--would be severely limited.
   Moreover, expected bad winter weather and heavy cloud cover during the
period could prevent Allied air attacks on the Croat attackers until after
Slavonia is reoccupied, a task that under ideal conditions could take only
a matter of hours, according to a senior U.S. military official.
   The Croatian government is under intense pressure from nationalist hawks
to retake the last part of Croatia still under Serb control. National
leaders believe NATO commanders may remain focused on Bosnia, allowing them
to prepare for an attack with some degree of freedom.
   ``The Belgian and Russian troops in the area now are clearly inadequate,
and in an offensive would do little more than provide targets,'' the
defense official said.
   Another temptation for the Croats is the relative slowness with which
NATO forces are moving into the region, establishing influence and
beginning to monitor military activities. By moving soon, the Croats might
face less NATO interference and fewer Allied troops.
   Finally, the Croatian military high command has contempt--which some
believe is misplaced--for the combat prowess of both the Bosnian Serb
military units and the Yugoslavian National Army (JNA).
   Senior Croat military leaders consider the JNA, in particular, to be
``clumsy , slow-moving and overly reliant on firepower and mass,'' the
senior U.S. military official said. ``The Croats point out very eagerly
that they would rely on tempo rather than mass. Their [doctrine is to]
reach deep and seize key points; isolate rather than overwhelm.''
   If the Croats retake eastern Slavonia, it will put them only the width
of the Danube River from Serbia which, so far, has stayed out of direct
participation in the Bosnian conflict. But a Croat attack to Serbia's
borders would be difficult for Serbia's leaders to swallow, and they might
retaliate.
   ``If the attack were just in Sector East [eastern Slavonia], the
Croatians can get to the Danube within hours, easily,'' the defense
official said. With heavy artillery, the Serbs could choose to saturate the
advancing Croats with long-range fire from across the river. ``They are
very good artillerymen,'' he said. To silence or inflict heavy damage on
the artillery, ``the Croats would have to go deep, use counter-battery fire
and use their air force,'' striking into Serbia proper.
   However, U.S. opinion is divided over what the JNA's response might be
and its potential effectiveness. The Krajina Serbs occupying Sector East
are seen as a great embarrassment to the Serbian national government. If
the Croats attacked quickly and were successful, there would likely be
little or no response from the JNA, a second senior U.S. defense official
said.
   ``If they get bogged down [in an extended fight], the Serbs might be
forced to weigh in,'' he said. ``The Croats really only have a small air
force'' consisting of a few dozen MiG-21 fighter bombers and Mi-24 attack
helicopters. ``If they tried striking across the Danube, the Serbian air
force could kick the hell out of them. It would be like poking at a
hornet's nest.''
   THIS SCENARIO COULD quickly undermine the fragile peace in the region.
So the question for the West becomes how to contain such aggressive moves
before they gather momentum. Western technology, much of it airborne, may
again provide the answer. The U.S., in particular, is moving its most
sophisticated intelligence gathering aircraft into the region. Moreover,
service planners are piecing together a sophisticated communications
network to collect, sort through and route this intelligence to key
decision makers that has no parallel, even in Desert Storm.
   Central to the U.S. effort will be its nationally controlled
surveillance satellite network and the decidedly more flexible U.S. Air
Force E-8 Joint-STARS, RC-135 Rivet Joint and EC-130 Airborne Command and
Control Centers and British Nimrod electronic warfare aircraft. Also
dedicated to the peacekeeping task will be the joint-service,
long-endurance Predator unmanned aerial vehicles that became operational in
1995.
   Some U.S. officials believe that, in particular, Joint-STARS'
intelligence collecting capability will ``be used as a confidence building
measure because it can look on both sides of the Danube River,'' the
intelligence official said, keeping track of military preparations by all
the factions--Croat, Bosnian and Serb. And the U.S. plans to use its
reconnaissance forces aggressively.
   ``We are going to enforce the peace our way,'' a U.S. military official
said. In order to prevent renewed hostilities, NATO forces will strike hard
and preemptively at anyone seen making preparations for war, he said.
   JOINT-STARS CAN accurately and continuously track ground vehicle and
low-flying helicopter traffic. Rivet Joint can plot the site and type of
electronic emissions and even monitor military voice and data
communications. Critical information, including the stated intentions of
suspected commanders and activities of small units, could be intercepted
and analyzed for NATO officials.
   The Predator UAV, which is scheduled to return to Bosnian operations at
the beginning of March, even has additional operational versatility. It can
fly directly over areas of interest, such as troop concentrations or
command sites, to observe at low altitude without risk to aircrews.
   Croatia formed the strike arm of its new air force around
Soviet-designed MiG-21 fighter bombers and Mi-24 attack helicopters from
the former East German air force. According to U.S. intelligence officials,
the Croatian government has even more money to spend on arms, unlike many
other Eastern European nations, and continues to survey the world market
for additional military equipment. U.S. officials decline to say how the
former East German equipment got to Croatia other than suggesting it was
``not a state to state'' transfer.

ROUGH BALKAN TERRAIN FORCES CHANGE IN JOINT-STARS' TACTICS

By:
DAVID A. FULGHUM

(WASHINGTON)
The U.S. E-8 Joint-STARS, NATO's major aerial platform for spying on
Bosnian military ground and helicopter traffic, will face much more
daunting terrain than it did in its 1991 operational debut in Operation
Desert Storm.
   Joint-STARS is expected to begin flying missions early this month to
provide NATO peacekeepers with improved situational awareness of Bosnian
government and Bosnian Serb movements. During Desert Storm, the long-range,
synthetic aperture radar-equipped aircraft were observing the virtually
featureless desert plains of Kuwait and Iraq, where even wind-blown barbed
wire could be seen by the aircraft's moving target indicator (MTI). From
the sky over Bosnia, U.S. military radar operators and analysts will have
to pick ground vehicles and low-flying helicopters out of topography
stitched with mountains and ravines that can often block the radar's view.
However, in compensation, the Bosnians will be restricted to a smaller
number of more predictable routes, generally following the valleys and
passes.
   TO MINIMIZE THE radar's difficulties in looking into narrow valleys or
the far side of mountains, mission planners have been plotting a variety of
flight tracks and orbits that will allow the two E-8s the most extended
looks at crucial road, rail and low-level flight routes, according to Air
Force and Northrop Grumman officials.
   The first task was to get the necessary permissions and clearances to
fly 60-120-n.m. tracks over Hungary, Croatia and the Adriatic Sea. With the
aircraft sensor's ability to look out to a range of 200 n.m., its crew can
keep the Joint-STARS well beyond range of Bosnian Serb SA-2 and SA-6
surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). Bosnian Serb threats to acquire the
long-range, more capable SA-10 SAMs have so far proven empty. Even so, no
proposed Joint-STARS patrol tracks will position aircraft over Serbia or
the Bosnian Serb Republic.
   Joint-STARS crewmen will rely on system-generated cues and predictive
algorithms that memorize the direction, speed and size of ground traffic
and alert operators if vehicles of interest do not move as expected or
predicted.
   ``If a [military] convoy disappears, it will alert you,'' a Northrop
Grumman official said of the Joint-STARS system. ``It has a memory; it
knows where to look'' for a string of vehicles, for example, to reappear
out of a valley or tunnel or from behind a mountain.
   The Joint-STARS' impressive computer memory also helps retain a radar
picture when the aircraft turns. The E-8 is limited to a 30-deg. bank, so
it takes about 2 min. to reverse its course in order to start a new leg of
a patrol. The aircraft is largely blind during much of the turn, so the
computer's memory is used to keep continuity in the ground picture.
Operators generally monitor a 60 X 60-n.m. target area at any moment.
   With only two available aircraft--a Desert Storm-veteran E-8A and the
first new E-8C--and three trained crews, the amount of time E-8s will be
available over Bosnia will be limited. Certainly, there will not be
around-the-clock coverage of Bosnia. It is likely the aircraft will be used
most extensively at night and in bad weather, two periods that treaty
violators would use to hide prohibited movements. The radar on the third
Joint-STARS aircraft, another A-model, has been removed. A fourth crew is
in training and might be available for Bosnian operations.
   The E-8C will have an almost all-military crew with only three or four
contractor personnel on board for maintenance chores. The older aircraft
still requires some contractor operators, an Air Force official said.
Ironically, the older aircraft actually have better imagery resolution than
the E-8C with its larger crew and more powerful computers. The E-8C is
awaiting an improvement to duplicate the older aircraft's image clarity.
About 25 contractor personnel have deployed to Rhein Main, Germany, with
the two aircraft.
   ONE HOT TOPIC OF debate in the surveillance community is how to best
find and track helicopter traffic. Helicopters have been used by all the
warring parties to violate United Nations no-fly zones, and NATO observers
are particularly eager to monitor and control such flights. Joint-STARS can
track helicopters, and the system will note and remember the distinctive
``pig-tail or death spiral'' pattern at the end of most helicopter flights.
As a result, Joint-STARS operators can plot sites regularly used by
helicopters for takeoffs and landings, such as headquarters, forward
refueling and rearming locations or other command and control sites, a
Northrop Grumman official said. A variety of such clues will be used to
analyze and predict helicopter and ground traffic.
   Joint-STARS also can receive the aerial picture from an E-3 AWACS, thus
allowing the E-8's operators to make a more comprehensive analysis of
Bosnian activities. AWACS does not have the capability of receiving the
Joint-STARS picture.

ELECTRONIC TAGS TO TRACK CARGO BOUND FOR BOSNIA

By:
DAVID HUGHES/BOSTON

   U.S. Transportation Dept. cargo tracking specialists are helping the
U.S. Army create a system for tagging nearly all military cargo headed for
Bosnia so it can be tracked electronically and monitored via satellite.
   Commercial electronic tags will be put on nearly all containers headed
into Bosnia. The tags, which will include cargo data, have small radio
transmitters with a limited range that can communicate with interrogation
units. These units will be placed at choke points on the land routes into
Bosnia and installed along with commercial-grade satellite communications
transmitters to beam data back to the U.S. via Inmarsat.
   Savi Technology, a company recently acquired by Texas Instruments, is
supplying some of the tags. Each one includes a miniature radio transceiver
and a microcomputer in a package about the size of a deck of playing
cards.
   WHEN TAGGED CARGO en route to Bosnia passes an interrogator, the
near-real-time data on cargo type and location will be received at a
command center in the Volpe Transportation System Center in Cambridge,
Mass., where the International Transportation Information Tracking
(Intransit) group works. This is the same group that tracked the shipment
of Patriot missiles to South Korea for the U.S. Army in 1994 (AW&ST May
16, 1994, p. 59).
   The Intransit specialists will also install a monitoring station for the
Army, probably at Huntsville, Ala. Smaller monitoring sites will also be
established in Germany, Hungary and Bosnia. Data will be sent first via
Inmarsat satellites to Cambridge, Mass., then relayed to the other sites.
   Intransit has assisted the United Nations in the past in monitoring the
enforcement of economic sanctions in the former Yugoslavia. For example,
oil barge traffic on the Danube River has been monitored by electronic
means.
   One of the main objectives of the Army is to make sure that a situation
does not develop like the one in Desert Storm in which thousands of
containers had to be opened after they arrived to see what was in them.
Electronic tags can be read by hand-held interrogators that will be
provided to soldiers. Commercially available tags are being used because
they are inexpensive enough to use in large quantities. The Army is also
using Qualcomm, a commercial cargo tracking system, to track some of the
cargo bound for Bosnia. Qualcomm uses Ku-band satellites.
   David Reed, chief of the Advanced Concepts Div. at the Volpe Center,
said commercially available electronic tags were used in Somalia with great
success. The Army already is using them at staging areas in the U.S. When
cargo arrives at Dover (Del.) AFB to be airlifted to Europe, it is
monitored by four interrogation units. Reed said palletized cargo bound for
Bosnia in military transports will be tagged, but may have to be retagged
at airports as it is repackaged for overland shipment.
   TRAINS LEAVING Germany for the former Yugoslavia may have satellite
communications equipment installed along with GPS receivers so their
positions can be monitored from the U.S. or Western Europe. As a train
passes an interrogator, it will be possible to check each tagged item.

ALASKAN AIR SAFETY OVERHAUL URGED

By:
EDWARD H. PHILLIPS

(WASHINGTON)
Alaska's rough terrain, adverse weather and isolated, often crude airfields
pose serious aviation safety risks that can be minimized through a series
of fundamental improvements, according to a U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board report.
   The chief safety issues identified by the NTSB's extensive review of
Alaskan aviation included weather reports and observations, airport
conditions, flight and duty rest times, and heavy reliance on visual flight
rules (VFR) by most commuter, air taxi and general aviation pilots.
   OF THESE, TAKEOFF AND LANDING accidents and continued flight into
instrument meteorological conditions were cited by the NTSB as the leading
causes of crashes in the state, which has the largest number of airplanes
per capita in the nation. Aviation is Alaska's main mode of transportation
and is often the only lifeline available for many remote villages.
   Although takeoff and landing accidents occur frequently, they result in
fewer deaths than flying into hazardous weather, the report said.
   Because a majority of commuter and air taxi operators depends on VFR
conditions to conduct their flights, they are under pressure to reach their
destination and become vulnerable to the vagaries of deteriorating
weather.
   To improve flight safety in Alaska, the NTSB is urging the FAA to:
  -- Implement by Dec. 31, 1997, a demonstration program to create a
low-altitude, IFR route system in the Arctic and southeast regions of the
state that would more fully meet the needs of Alaska's air transportation
industry.
   Such a network would include use of the Global Positioning System as a
sole source of navigation for both en route and non-precision instrument
approaches. Many of Alaska's remote airfields lack any type of instrument
approach capability.
   The system also would use satellite-based voice communications as well
as Mode S transponders or VHF data link to provide air traffic controllers
with information on aircraft position and altitude. In addition,
uncontrolled airspace would be used during the program to accommodate IFR
departures, en route traffic and instrument approaches.
   In another key part of the program, NTSB officials are urging the FAA to
permit the use of turbine-powered, single-engine aircraft in commercial
operations under IFR, if they are equipped with redundant vacuum and
electrical subsystems. Current FAA rules prohibit use of single-engine
aircraft to carry passengers under VFR or IFR conditions.
   Although the agency already is studying the possibility of allowing
single-engine, turbine-powered aircraft to conduct such operations with
paying passengers on board, the NTSB also is recommending that the FAA
evaluate whether single-engine, piston-powered aircraft should be included.
The majority of small aircraft flying in Alaska are powered by
reciprocating engines, but a growing number of turboprop-powered aircraft
are entering commercial service.
  -- Determine the effect on safety of converting existing VFR operations
conducted under FAR Part 135 into IFR operations at remote or isolated
landing sites. The FAA would consider expanding weather reporting
facilities at such locations, install automated weather reporting systems,
or develop nonprecision instrument approaches at the sites and allow
operators to use them without the benefit of extensive weather data.
  -- Require Part 135 operators to provide initial and recurrent training
to pilots in aeronautical decision-making and judgment. The training would
be tailored specifically to that operator's environment. Commercial
operators also would be required to develop flight time duty limitations.
  -- Assist the National Weather Service in providing graphical weather
information to pilots that is specific to Alaska, and distribute that data
via the Rural Alaska Television network, Direct User Access Terminal
(DUAT), Alaska Public Television and the Internet.
  -- Ensure that staffing at Alaska's Automated Flight Service Stations
are adequate and that problems associated with poor radio communications
capability through remote outlets or navaids can be resolved.
  -- Modify the Notice to Airmen system to permit dissemination of
unverified information, labeled as such, about airport and remote field
conditions reported by official and unofficial aviation resources. The
report also suggests that a training program be established that would
permit ``microphone-in-hand'' reports on airport conditions by Alaska
airport maintenance personnel and contract workers.

TRAMCO HELPS AMERICA WEST

(LOS ANGELES)
America West Airlines has decided to have Tramco in Everett, Wash., perform
its heavy C and D-check maintenance, instead of continuing the work at the
carrier's Phoenix base.
   About 500 America West employees will lose their jobs as a result. The
company expects to save $35 million over the five-year Tramco contract,
including a $10.5-million one-time charge for the shift. The airline said
about 470 employees will be retained for line maintenance at Phoenix. The
maintenance employees are nonunion.
   ``Maintaining our low-cost advantage relative to our competitors is
imperative to America West's financial security now and in the future,''
said W. Douglas Parker, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
Several of its competitors, including Southwest Airlines, already outsource
all or part of their heavy maintenance.
   Tramco has been performing modifications and other maintenance for
America West over the last two years.
   Laid-off employees will receive about 35% of annual salary, and those
with six years tenure will receive 56%. The airline expects to add 800-900
jobs to the Phoenix area as part of its two-year growth plan (AW&ST Nov.
13, 1995, p. 28).

TWA BEGINS RECOVERY, BUT REMAINS UNPROVEN

By:
ANTHONY L. VELOCCI, JR.

(NEW YORK)
Trans World Airlines Inc., while still no picture of health, appears to be
on the path to a recovery scarcely imagined a year ago.
Here's why:
  -- Entering the industry's traditional January-March slow period, TWA has
a cash cushion of more than $300 million. That is nearly triple the amount
the company had in reserve in January.
  -- TWA is one of only two full-service carriers in the U.S. that reduced
its cost per available seat mile significantly in 1995, according to
industry analysts; Delta Air Lines is the other. Excluding subsidiary
operations, TWA's cost per ASM at the end of the third quarter was 7.8
cents, down from 8.3 in December, 1994.
  -- Operating cash flow--the lifeblood of a business--has increased
substantially and is more than sufficient to cover the airline's debt
obligations. In fact, the ratio of cash flow to interest and principal
coverage currently stands at its highest level in years. Prior to this
year, TWA was scraping by.
   ``The company's image has been tarnished for so long, I'm getting real
enjoyment out of surprising all of the skeptics who thought we couldn't
possibly survive, much less make money,'' Chief Financial Officer Robert
Peiser said.
   At the start of 1995, the airline projected a net loss of $237 million
for the full year. Actual losses for the first nine months were about $200
million, which means the airline is approximately on target with its
business plan. For 1996, the airline expects to generate operating and net
income of $251 million and $95 million, respectively.
   TWA has started to convert some skeptics into cautious optimists. ``It's
remarkable what the airline has accomplished,'' Furman Selz analyst Raymond
Neidl said.
  According to Michael K. Lowry's assessment, TWA ``has turned the
corner.'' ``Its financial condition is substantially better, liquidity is
improving, and passenger demand for TWA's product is firm,'' said the
president of Aviation Forecasting & Economics Inc., in Lake Oswego, Ore.
   While all of that may be true, there remain those who continue to look
upon TWA as still a largely unproven entity.
   ``A rising tide lifts all ships, and a good deal of improvement at TWA
is attributable to the favorable operating conditions, as well as the
demise of Continental Airlines' CalLite,'' Rene Shaker, an analyst at
Moody's Investors Service, said. ``TWA still has significant challenges
ahead.''
   One of those is Southwest Airlines' encroachment into St. Louis, TWA's
largest and most important domestic hub, she said. Another challenge is
strengthening the airline's international operations. Load factors are
about 12% higher than last year, but that part of TWA's business is widely
perceived as hobbled because it includes no route authority to London's
Heathrow Airport.
   ``It's not that TWA can't make money from the international routes it
has in place now,'' First Boston analyst Paul Karos said. ``It's just that
non-Heathrow routes tend to be lower-margin business, on average.''
   THERE ALSO IS A LACK of understanding on just what it is that TWA hopes
to become. ``Management needs to do a better job of defining the role they
envision for the airline long-term,'' Shaker said. ``Fighting a battle for
survival, which it seems to have won, and fighting for competitive position
are quite different,'' Shaker said.
   Perhaps TWA's most pressing chore is increasing revenues. ''For now, the
carrier probably has done as much as it can to clean up its balance sheet
and reduce debt service,'' Neidl said.
   TWA management has put revenue enhancement at the top of its priority
list and taken the action necessary to position the airline for substantial
top-line growth, starting in1996. A new computerized yield-management
system is expected to optimize the allocation of full-fare and discounted
seats on all of TWA's daily flights. TWA is the last major U.S. carrier to
adopt such a system, which is considered essential in today's competitive
environment.
   TWA's 1994 revenues were about $3 billion. Neidl believes the carrier's
yield-management system could increase that by about 3% or $100 million
annually--an estimate that Peiser said is reasonable.
   The airline also is trying to address the seasonal swings in its
revenues. TWA hopes to form a number of code-sharing alliances with other
carriers in the U.S. and in other countries. ``We have a good shot at
seeing a number of them materialize in the near future,'' Peiser said.
   Additionally, TWA has signed an agreements with a major tour operator,
who has guaranteed to fill a large number of seats on flights bound for
warmer climate destinations. This will complement the carrier's efforts to
fortify its presence in the Caribbean, Mexico and other parts of Central
America, as well as seasonal increase in service to Florida.
  THE PROBLEM IS THAT TWA is somewhat restricted in how fast it can move
into or expand in markets where its greatest revenue opportunities may
exist. The carrier simply does not have enough aircraft. Management is in
the market for replacement aircraft and hopes to make an announcement soon
concerning its fleet plan.

MD-83 TREE STRIKE SPARKS NTSB PROBE

By:
DAVID HUGHES

(BOSTON)
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating an incident in
which an American Airlines MD-83 made an emergency landing after striking
the tops of trees on a ridge as it was making a non-precision approach to
Bradley International Airport.
   Only one person was slightly injured during the evacuation following an
emergency landing, but the aircraft incurred damage to its wings and
landing gear. The aircraft carried a crew of five and 72 passengers as it
landed shortly before 1 a.m. at Bradley at Windsor Locks, Conn., on Nov.
12.
   The mishap has drawn a high level of interest at the NTSB, which has
started looking at major incidents as closely as accidents in recent years.
A full report on the incident should be completed by late spring or early
summer. An NTSB investigator said ``a lot happened'' during the 70 sec.
from the time the plane struck the trees until it came to a stop on the
runway. The NTSB is still piecing together the course of events. There were
reports of gusty winds and turbulence in the area at the time of the
incident, but the NTSB is still evaluating data to see if wind shear was a
factor.
   The week after the incident American told its pilots to add 100 ft. to
the minimum descent altitude (MDA) on all non-precision approaches and to
add .5 mi. to the visibility minimums. An American official said this
temporary change applies to its operations worldwide while the company
evaluates all of the non-precision approaches in its route system.
   The VOR approach to Runway 15 at Bradley calls for aircraft to pass a
final approach fix at 4.8 mi. from the runway (5 mi. DME from the Bradley
VOR on the airfield) and descend from 2,000 ft. to the MDA of 1,080 ft.
There is a ridge between the final approach fix and the runway that has an
elevation of about 770 ft. with a stand of trees on it about 50 ft. tall.
The MDA is calculated by adding 250 ft. to the 820 ft. obstacle elevation
and then rounded up to a 20-ft. interval, to arrive at 1,080 ft.
   The aircraft had descended from the final approach fix and flown almost
half- way to the runway when the pilots received a ground proximity warning
system ``sink rate'' alert just prior to striking the trees. The pilots
were unable to avert impact with the trees, but as the aircraft skimmed the
tree tops they were able to advance the power and initiate a go-around to
avoid crashing in the wooded area. An on-board wind shear alert sounded
after the aircraft hit the trees and the NTSB is studying this.
   THE PILOTS DID NOT REALIZE they had struck the trees even though they
heard a loud noise, or that the encounter with the trees had dented and
torn holes in the flaps and slats. Both wing tips had been hit, composite
material had been shattered and the navigation lights were broken. Brush
and tree limbs were found in the wheel well and a landing gear door had
been torn off. The horizontal stabilizer had incurred some damage, perhaps
from flying wood debris, but the plane was still flying.
   The pilots began to retract the gear and flaps but then elected to land
instead when they spotted the runway lights. The Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219
engines were not producing full power and NTSB investigators found evidence
that the right engine caught fire at some point after impact with the
trees. It has not been determined whether the right engine failed.
   When the pilots saw the runway, they selected gear down and flaps 40
deg. The gear and flaps worked, even though some of the hydraulic lines
running through the wheel well had been broken. The aircraft was equipped
with a 60-channel flight data recorder, which is providing good data.
   THE AIRCRAFT STILL HAD difficulty making the runway. Workmen had removed
some trees from the approach end of Runway 15 the week before the incident.
Those trees could have posed an additional hazard on this emergency
approach. The MD-83 wiped out a whole row of T-shaped ILS antennas as it
approached the threshold and then touched down short of the runway in the
overrun area and bounced once before rolling 4,000 ft. to a full stop. The
brakes were still functioning. The crew and passengers then evacuated the
plane.
   The NTSB is trying to determine why the aircraft was about 260 ft. low
when it struck the stand of trees on a ridge and cut a path about 250 ft.
long and 100 ft. wide. The aircraft broke off mostly 2-in.-dia. branches up
to 15 ft. below the top of the trees before climbing away from the
obstruction. Some larger branches also were broken off.
   Investigators are examining what procedures the pilots used in setting
altimeters and maintaining MDA, what role turbulence may have played and
whether the height of the ridge line was correctly surveyed. Another
question is whether the crew stopped the descent before striking the
trees.
   The National Weather Service at the airport was reporting winds of 170
deg. at 25 kt. gusting to 40 kt. about 5 min. before the MD-83 landed. An
LLWAS alert did sound in another quadrant of the airport about 2 min. prior
to the tree strike incident.
   THE WEATHER OBSERVATION at Bradley 5 min. before the plane landed also
noted cloud cover of 1,700 ft. scattered and 2,800 ft. overcast with
barometric pressure falling rapidly. The visibility of 3 mi. in moderate
rain was sufficient to fly the VOR Runway 15 approach. The tower was closed
because a window had been blown loose. A air traffic controller who was
assisting repairmen responded to a radio call from the American Airlines
flight prior to the incident and advised the crew of the winds and the
LLWAS alert, and that the runway was clear.
   The NTSB is looking at the weather information provided to the crew and
how up-to-date it was as well as the altimeter data received from Boston
Center and ACARS. A special American Airlines procedure for having pilots
set their altimeters so they read zero on the runway has been examined by
the NTSB but is not an area of interest in the investigation. All three
altimeters on the MD-83 have been tested and found to be working properly.
   An international aviation industry group led by the Flight Safety
Foundation, with ICAO involvement, has been trying to have the way
non-precision approaches are designed changed to avoid the potential for
controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT). The CFIT task force would also like
aircraft to descend gradually on these approaches as if they were on an ILS
glidepath.
   American completed temporary repairs and flew the aircraft to its
maintenance base in Tulsa, Okla. The engines have been torn down; there
was heavy damage to the right engine and the rotating parts in the left
engine were out of alignment.

CRASH TRIGGERS REVIEW OF AMR
FAA launches inquiry as NTSB weighs review of training at American, Eagle
carriers

By:
JAMES T. McKENNA

(MELBOURNE, FLA.)
U.S. officials are weighing an inquest into pilot training at American
Airlines and its regional affiliates in the wake of a 757 crash that
appears to have been caused in part by poor cockpit discipline.
   Senior National Transportation Safety Board officials believe the Dec.
20 crash of American Flight 965 into a mountain near Cali, Colombia,
warrants a probe of training at American's Flight Academy. American and its
four American Eagle affiliates train pilots there.
   The FAA has begun a review of American's operating procedures and
training with the airline and its pilots union, the Allied Pilots Assn.
   The Boeing 757-223's flight data and cockpit voice recorders were flown
at the Colombian government's request to the NTSB's laboratory in
Washington. U.S. and Colombian investigators there reviewed 30 min. of data
from the digital Sundstrand Data Control 980-4100 FDR and transcribed 30
min. 36 sec. of data from the Fairchild A-100 CVR.
   According to Capt. German Duarte, a Colombian investigator, the recorder
data sets contained no indications that the pilots of Flight 965 performed
their descent checklist or an arrival/approach procedures briefing.
   The pilots may have been confused about navigation aids used during
their approach to Runway 19 at Cali's Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International
Airport, he said, adding that they may have botched an ``escape maneuver''
as their aircraft neared the San Jose mountain.
   The NTSB and FAA are only assisting in the Flight 965 investigation,
which is being run by Colombia's civil aviation authority. Their focus on
training at American and the American Eagle carriers stems from the fact
that the crash just south of Buga, Colombia, is the latest in a string of
American-affiliated accidents.
   THE BUGA CRASH, IN WHICH 163 persons on board were killed, was only the
second fatal accident involving an American Airlines aircraft in 16 years.
But it was the fourth accident in 14 months and the second in just 39 days
involving American or American Eagle crews.
   ``It appears that [the Colombian] accident was entirely within the
cockpit,'' one U.S. official involved with the investigation told AVIATION
WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY. Added to the string of other accidents, ``that's a
highly unusual rate of training-related events.''
   The NTSB already has launched a major investigation of an American
flight that ripped 100 ft. through treetops before landing at Bradley
International Airport in Connecticut (see p. 44).
   Flight 965 departed Miami with 167 persons on board, including six
Bogota-based cabin crewmembers, Capt. Nicholas Tafuri and First Officer Don
Williams. Air traffic controllers at Cali lost radio contact with the
aircraft at 9:38 p.m. Duarte gave the following description of events:
   Tafuri, working the radios, contacted approach control as Flight 965
descended through 20,000 ft. about 63 mi. north of Cali. The controller
said the flight was ``cleared direct to Cali VOR, descend and maintain
one-five thousand.''
   Tafuri, who had more than 10,000 hr. of flying time and more than 2,000
hr. in the 757, acknowledged the clearance.
   Two minutes later, the controller radioed that winds at the airport were
calm and asked whether Flight 965 could approach Runway 19.
   ``Yes, sir,'' Tafuri said. ``We'll need a lower altitude right away,
though.''
   The controller then cleared the flight ``to the VOR DME approach runway
one-niner, ROZO number one arrival. Report Tulua VOR.''
   ``We'll report the VOR, thank you, sir.''
   Cali approach reiterated, ``Report Tulua,'' which the crew
acknowledged.
   The pilots then consulted their approach plate publications and
discussed the navaids to be used in the ROZO 1 arrival and their position
relative to Tulua VOR. They then asked if they could fly direct to the ROZO
nondirectional radio beacon north of the airport and execute the arrival
procedure.
   ``Affirmative, direct ROZO one and then runway one-niner, the winds
calm,'' the approach controller responded.
   After the crew acknowledged that, the controller said, ``Affirmative,
report Tulua and twenty-one miles, five thousand feet.'' The crew agreed.
   Duarte said the FDR indicates that at a point south of the Tulua VOR,
the pilots selected that VOR, code ULQ, in the flight management system.
The aircraft then turned left for about 90 sec., to an easterly heading.
   As the descent continued, the autopilot was switched to the heading
select mode and the aircraft entered a right turn to the southwest.
   The 757's ground-proximity warning system (GPWS) issued a ``Terrain''
mode warning, and called out ``Pull Up!'' repeatedly for 9 sec., until the
CVR tape ended. FDR data indicated that the pilots initiated a GPWS escape
maneuver, increasing engine power and pitching the nose up, 2 sec. after
the first aural warning. The stickshaker activated during this maneuver.
   FDR data also indicate that the flight spoilers, which had been deployed
during the descent, remained extended until impact, Duarte said. The
aircraft hit near the top of the 12,000-ft. mountain 12 mi. east of its
desired approach path and 38 mi. north of Cali.

747 SKID PROBED

(NEW YORK)
The NTSB is investigating why a Miami-bound Tower Air 747 departing New
York's JFK International Airport skidded off Runway 4L at 11:36 a.m. Dec.
20, the second day of a heavy East Coast winter storm.
   At the time of takeoff into falling snow, JFK ATIS was reporting winds
from 330 deg. at 11 kt. and a 2,000-ft. RVR. According to NTSB preliminary
accident data, the pilot of Flight No. 41 reported control difficulty
during the takeoff roll, then aborted takeoff on the 11,352-ft. runway at
an airspeed ``under 80 kt.'' Markings indicate the aircraft initially
departed the runway to the left, 1,200 ft. from the start of the roll. The
747 continued to veer left, then fully departed Runway 4L 2,100 ft. from
the beginning of the roll. The aircraft, with about 102,000 lb. of fuel on
board, hit an electrical conduit structure, which tore off the No. 4
JT9D-7A engine.
   The aircraft came to rest 4,800 ft. from the start of the roll, 800 ft.
to the left of runway centerline in a nose-down position, its nosegear and
right main gear collapsed. Portions of struts had pushed through the
forward cabin, lifting seats 2-3 ft.
   There were no fatalities, and about 35 minor injuries were reported
among the 445 passengers and 15 crew, all of whom were evacuated safely.
   The 747 had been deiced twice prior to departure, and the NTSB said the
aircraft was ``well within'' departure safety limits following its second
deicing. Tower Air Chairman and CEO Morris Nachtomi said on the day of the
accident ice and snow accumulation on the runway had caused the aircraft to
skid.
   The NTSB said it is encountering difficulty reading FDR data due to
software problems. But the safety board expects this to be resolved and
results of the investigation released within 3-4 months.

BOEING TO EXPAND 737 `ROLLS' PROGRAM

By:
EDWARD H. PHILLIPS

(WASHINGTON)
Boeing's special ``rolls team'' is completing its probe into uncommanded
rolls involving 737-series aircraft as company engineers analyze new wake
turbulence data pertinent to the crash of a USAir 737-300 in September,
1994.
   Between April and August, 1995, Boeing received reports of 20 incidents
from U.S. airlines involving unexpected rolls in the 737. Most of the
incidents could not be explained by equipment faults or failures associated
with autopilot or yaw damper systems, Jean A. McGrew, 737 chief project
engineer, said.
   To address those incidents, Boeing formed the team in August to
determine why the rolls were occurring. Initial analysis indicated the
events ``were clearly different'' than typical anomalies, he said. Using
information from each aircraft's flight data recorder (FDR), the team
reviewed the events and conducted an analysis of the 737's lateral control
systems in an attempt to find a cause. By comparing FDR traces, a pattern
gradually emerged, McGrew said.
   In each case, during the initial upset 50% of the traces showed similar
characteristics, such as small increases in airspeed accompanied by rapid
roll rates and significant changes in vertical load factor, particularly
near peak roll angle. Mechanical failures typically do not produce such
changes in load factor, according to McGrew.
   Roll rates, for example, initially were slow but increased to values
well above the 6-7 deg./sec. normally induced by a system fault such as an
autopilot hardover. In addition, not all of the aircraft rolled in the same
direction, he said.
   When the traces were compared with those of five 737s known to have
encountered wake turbulence, the similarities were ``remarkable,'' McGrew
said. The team determined that at least seven upsets probably were caused
by wake turbulence, five were caused by equipment failures, and another
three involved some degree of interaction by the flight crew.
   As a result of the team's work with FDR traces, Boeing essentially has
developed a process to discern between an in-service roll event caused by a
failure and one caused by wake turbulence. McGrew expects Boeing will
expand the program this year to include other U.S. airlines and foreign
carriers operating the 737.
   Exactly what role wake vortices played in the loss of control of USAir
Flight 427 remains largely unknown. Boeing engineers expect analysis of new
data on vortex encounters will help them better understand the positions of
primary flight controls after the initial upset occurred.
   The USAir 737 was flying at 6,000 ft. about 4.5 n.m. behind a Delta Air
Lines 727-200 when it apparently encountered wake turbulence from the lead
aircraft during initial approach to Pittsburgh. The ensuing loss of control
led to a crash that killed all 132 people on board.
   U.S. National Transportation Safety Board officials are particularly
interested in movement of the aircraft's rudder. Accident analysis
indicates the rudder was deflected up to 21 deg. during the upset event and
remained displaced until impact with the ground. After 15 months of
intensive investigation, neither the NTSB nor Boeing has been able to
determine what could have caused the rudder to move.
   Boeing engineers are still extracting data from wake vortex research
flights conducted last September (AW&ST Oct. 2, 1995, p. 33).
   The chief purpose of the flights was to define more precisely the
location of the 727's vortices in relation to the accident aircraft.
   Engineers can then calculate aerodynamic coefficients of the airplane
within the vortex flow field to help verify accuracy of a distributed lift
model for the 737-300 developed by Boeing, James W. Kerrigan said. He is
lead aerodynamics engineer, 737-series stability and control, for Boeing
Commercial Airplane Co.
   Prior to the flights in September, engineers lacked data from airborne
wake encounters to support results generated by the model.

PRODUCTION EXPANSION HERALDS MARKET UPTURN

(SEATTLE)
Boeing will increase production by four transports a month to 24 by early
1997 to accommodate increased sales and help recover from a 10-week
machinists' strike. This will be the first production rate increase for
Boeing in three years.
   The shift signals the long-awaited upswing of the international
commercial transport market. Boeing's deliveries during the strike fell
behind by about 30 aircraft.
   The production spool-up affects almost all Boeing transport lines. Build
rate for the 737 narrow-body will increase to 8.5 a month from seven per
month by the fourth quarter of 1996. This reverses a previous plan to drop
production to five airplanes a month by April. The manufacturing rate of
Boeing's flagship 747 also will increase to 3.5 monthly from two by
year-end.
   Construction of wide-body 767s will increase from 3.5 to four a month
during 1996. The new Boeing 777, now being built at a rate of 3.5/month,
will increase to five a month in early 1997.
   ALTHOUGH THE MANUFACTURING rate of the 757 still will decline in 1996
from four to three transports a month, the move to the lower rate has been
postponed from June to September.
   Major orders for Boeing wide-body aircraft by Saudi Arabian Airlines and
Singapore Airlines helped drive the production expansion. Boeing also has
been successful at selling its new ``next-generation'' line of 737s. This
includes a year-end deal with China Airlines for six 737-800s and nine
options potentially worth $750 million.
   During 1995, the Seattle-based manufacturer announced new orders for 261
transports valued at $19 billion. This more than doubled the previous
year's total of 120 new orders worth $7.76 billion.
   The 777 has been a strong performer for Boeing, garnering about 230
orders and commitments. Since its October, 1990, launch, the 777 has won an
80% market share, according to top Boeing managers. The modernized 737-600/
700/800 series has logged almost as many sales, for 220 units, in the
little over two years it has been available.

PRIVACY ISSUES FRAME PILOT RECORDS DEBATE

By:
EDWARD H. PHILLIPS

(WASHINGTON)
Airline industry officials are urging Congress to be cautious about
legislation regarding accessibility of pilot employment records because of
serious privacy and legal issues.
   During testimony before the House aviation subcommittee in December, a
number of senior airline and air taxi industry representatives told
lawmakers they generally favor at least limited access to a pilot's
personnel records as part of a pre-employment program.
   OFFICIALS WITHIN the airline industry support access to personnel
records by prospective employers, but are concerned about ``thorny privacy,
defamation, negligence and contract interference issues'' that must be
``thoroughly explored and resolved'' to protect both the airlines and
pilots, Edward Merlis, senior vice president of the Air Transport Assn.,
said. The ATA represents most major U.S. airlines including cargo
carriers.
   ``It's a subject which must be addressed,'' Randolph Babbitt, president
of the Air Line Pilots Assn., said. ALPA represents more than 44,000 pilots
at 37 airlines. Babbitt considers recommendations made by the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board as ``too narrow'' in scope.
   Safety board officials made the recommendations after its investigation
into the crash of an American Eagle regional transport in December, 1994.
The captain's previous employer was not required to transfer his records to
the American Eagle carrier. Those records revealed previous deficiencies in
the pilot's flying performance that were unknown by American Eagle.
   The NTSB wants standardized information about pilot qualifications to be
maintained and shared among airlines as well as independent training
agencies such as FlightSafety International. An airline's hiring and
training practices currently are not required to meet any standard
specifications except those mandated by the Federal Aviation Regulations.
As a result, hiring practices are ``extremely diverse,'' Babbitt said.
   To strengthen control of pilot records, ALPA is calling for a program
similar to one proposed in 1992 by a Transportation Dept. study that
suggested more stringent hiring and training procedures as well as
formulation of performance-based standards for entry-level pilots. Tougher
pre-employment screening, standardized training and monitoring programs
would help maintain ``the high quality of airline pilots, both now and in
the future,'' Babbitt said.
   HE WANTS THE NTSB to conduct a special study of hiring and training
rules within the U.S. airline industry, followed by an FAA/industry
coalition charged with implementing new changes.
   The National Air Transportation Assn. (NATA) supports a bill introduced
last month by Sen. John McCain (R.-Ariz.) that would provide some degree of
liability protection for airlines releasing pilot records. The bill
essentially would permit the transfer of a pilot's existing records to
another airline if the pilot had applied for a job with the second
carrier.

IATA'S AVIATION ENGLISH COURSE COMES TO CHINA

(HONG KONG)
China's aviation establishment has asked the International Air Transport
Assn. to conduct a major aviation English language skills course as part of
the country's drive to meet world air safety standards.
   Training would be given to some 2,000 pilots and as yet an undetermined
number of air traffic controllers. It would be modeled after a similar
program that IATA set up three years ago in Prague for Eastern European
airlines. Training will be in language skills only; IATA is not teaching
piloting or ATC skills.
   THE REQUEST COMES FROM the Civil Aviation Administration of China with
Air China's pilots in mind as the first students. A lack of English skills
is regarded as one of China's most persistent problems (AW&ST Oct. 2, 1995,
p. 50).
   Director General Pierre Jeanniot said IATA and the CAAC also will
establish a joint-venture data processing center to bring China's billing
and settlement services up to international standards. The Chinese had
initially undertaken the task on their own, but realized they were
reinventing the wheel and will now turn to proven IATA software to make the
task easier.
   IATA will provide its first training for the Chinese aviation sector to
a group of 250 travel agents, who will learn accounting procedures for
interlining of tickets as well as other tasks. Jeanniot said there was a
potential need for 10,000 Chinese travel agents to be trained.
   The three Chinese IATA members--Air China, China Southern and China
Eastern--will send managers to Geneva for courses in various business
tasks, such as yield management and weight balancing.
   Jeanniot, who recently visited Beijing to discuss cooperation with the
CAAC, said IATA will begin translating its technical documents into
Chinese. The first will be IATA's Dangerous Goods Manual.
   Late last year, IATA began reviewing China Northern's application to
become its fourth Chinese member airline. A fifth member--probably China
Southwest--could be admitted during the next year.
   Jeanniot criticized the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for its tight
grip on civil aviation operations. He particularly targeted the PLA's
control of the nation's airspace and sale of aviation fuel, which is twice
as high as world averages.
   ``There is a need for a political decision'' at a high level to reduce
the role of the military in civil aviation policy, he said.
   Jeanniot praised China's efforts to improve air safety. But he noted
that in many areas the effort is uncoordinated. For instance, airlines are
not permitted to discuss airport expansion programs with planners.
   ``A customer-driven industry concept doesn't exist'' in China, he
commented.

DELTA, LOCKHEED MARTIN PURSUE JOINT L-1011 WORK

By:
JAMES T. McKENNA

(MELBOURNE, FLA.)
Delta Air Lines and Lockheed Martin are teaming to close what they say is a
gap in maintenance services for L-1011 aircraft in North America.
   The airline, which is among the world's largest L-1011 operators, has
signed an agreement to join with Lockheed Martin to provide comprehensive
maintenance, engineering and parts support for more than 200 L-1011s in
service in the world today. Lockheed built the aircraft in the 1970s.
   The partnership, the terms of which will be defined over the next
several months, should allow Delta to boost its financial performance. The
carrier would gain additional revenue from contracts to service L-1011s for
other carriers. It also would be able to spread the cost of performing
damage-tolerance assessments of airframe repairs to its fleet of 56 L-1011s
over a larger base that included other carriers' aircraft.
   Lockheed Martin, in turn, would be able to add Delta's shop, engineering
and spares capabilities to the global L-1011 support structure. It also
would be able to market its overhaul and maintenance centers as a
``one-stop shop'' for L-1011 services.
   AN ALLIANCE OF DELTA and Lockheed Martin ``would fill a major void in
North America for L-1011 maintenance and support services,'' Dan Patterson,
president of Lockheed Martin Aircraft Center in Greenville, N.C., said.
Patterson recently took over at the former Lockheed Aeromod Center after
three years of running NASA's space shuttle launch operations as head of
Lockheed Space Operations Co.
   Lockheed Martin officials had been concerned that their limited aircraft
support structure would be strained by the migration of L-1011s from major
operators in North America and Asia to smaller operators in Asia, Africa
and Latin America.
   Trans World Airlines and Cathay Pacific, both carriers with extensive
engineering and maintenance capabilities, have begun selling off their
L-1011s. The smaller airlines likely to buy such aircraft may not have
substantial engineering and maintenance operations or the interest and
money to develop such operations. They would require a greater level of
engineering, maintenance and spares-production services than the current
L-1011 operators.
   That demand would tax the existing L-1011 support structure. The
perception that that structure is overburdened might cause used-aircraft
customers to favor McDonnell Douglas DC-10s, which enjoy a wider and more
robust support structure.
   The result would be a rising number of parked L-1011s and declining
support-service revenue for the company.
   In their search for more support business, Lockheed Martin
representatives decided to check on Delta's interest in farming out L-1011
maintenance to the center in Greenville.
   Contrary to ``outsourcing'' that work, ``Delta was interested in
'in-sourcing,' bringing more third-party L-1011 work in house,'' Robert
Stephenson said. The director of strategic and technical development at the
Greenville center, Stephenson participated in those initial talks.
   When the talks concluded, he said, both the Delta and Lockheed Martin
officials realized that the answer was for the companies to join in
pursuing L-1011 maintenance work.
   ``An alliance takes advantage of each other's inherent strengths,'' Ray
Valeika, Delta's vice president of technical operations, said. ``Together,
we have all the technical skill to keep those airplanes flying. It's a
niche for us that no one else can move into.''
   Valeika and Stephenson are used to working with each other, having
served together as engineers for Pan American World Airways for a number of
years.
   As envisioned now, Lockheed Martin would concentrate on L-1011 airframe
maintenance and modifications, including freighter conversions. The
company's Aircraft Service Co. in Ontario, Calif., which hold a
supplemental type certificate for an L-1011 freighter conversion, would
receive additional work under the alliance. But most of the work would go
to Greenville.
   Delta would overhaul and maintain alliance customers' Rolls-Royce RB211
engines, as well as aircraft component refurbishment and shop support.
   Greenville already handles some L-1011 airframe work, ``but the
customers are pretty much on their own for the engine and component work
right now,'' Stephenson said. The advantage of working with Delta is that
work could be trucked from Greenville to Atlanta in 2.5 hr. and be done
under one contract, he said.
   Delta will continue to do all its L-1011 airframe and powerplant
maintenance work in house, Valeika said, and may expand the wing
modification work it does now to include alliance customers' aircraft.
   The partners envision a range of services for customers, from a one-time
overhaul to complete turn-key maintenance services for an airline.
Stephenson said they are already at work contacting potential customers.

supporting its L-1011s over a larger base and generate more revenue from
its maintenance unit.

THAAD TEST FAILURE LINKED TO SOFTWARE ERROR

U.S. Army and Lockheed Martin engineers suspect a computer software error
caused the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) missile to stray off
course initially and miss a Storm target during an attempted intercept on
Dec. 13.
   Analysis of the failed test at White Sands (N.M.) Missile Range
indicates the missile strayed from its expected course due to the error.
After this, the Thaad kill vehicle attempted to correct the error and hit
the target. However, the divert and attitude control system that guides the
kill vehicle had to perform so many corrections that it ran out of fuel and
failed to complete the intercept. Army officials said the Thaad kill
vehicle properly acquired, designated and tracked the Storm target. The
Raytheon Ground-Based Radar, operating in a shadow role, acquired and
tracked the Thaad missile and Storm target correctly.
   An Army official said fixing the software problem should not delay the
next Thaad test, in February. The target still is expected to be a Coleman
Research Corp. Hera. The demonstration and validation test schedule calls
for 10 firings this year.

FIRST FLIGHT FOR HONDA ENGINE

Honda R&D has begun test flights of an experimental, 1,800-lb.-thrust-class
turbofan engine at California's Mojave Airport.
   The powerplant, called the Honda R&D Experimental Turbo Fan, made its
first flight on Dec. 18 mounted on the starboard, forward fuselage area of
a Boeing 727-100 test aircraft. The pilot for the 2.5-hr. initial flight
was Roger Wolfe.
   Testing was conducted mostly at 15,000 ft. at an average airspeed of 250
kt. During the flight, the engine instrumentation was checked, the
operability of the engine's controls verified, and powerplant performance
examined, including the engine's ability to relight.
   According to Honda officials, the engine has a bypass ratio of 4.3, a
dry weight of 485 lb. and is 46.3 in. long.
   The powerplant has been under development at Honda for more than a
decade, and flight tests are expected to extend through this year. Future
plans for commercializing the powerplant are indefinite, and Honda is still
unsure whether it eventually will attempt to enter into the aviation gas
turbine market.

PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON vetoed the $265-billion Fiscal 1996 defense

PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON vetoed the $265-billion Fiscal 1996 defense
authorization bill late last week, which was $7 billion more than he
sought. He cited objections to costly, unneeded weapon systems and
congressional pressure to build and deploy a national missile defense
system by 2003. Clinton said the latter would violate the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia and damage arms control efforts.
The President also objected to provisions requiring him to ask Congress for
funding within 45 days of ordering an overseas troop deployment. However,
he did not object to long lead funding for additional B-2 bombers.

9,000 PILOTS HIRED IN `95

U.S. airlines hired more than 9,000 pilots in 1995 and should exceed that
number in 1996 as both major and regional carriers expand capacity to meet
growing demand.
   Major carriers added 2,300 new cockpit crewmembers to their rosters, or
about 1,000 more pilots than in 1994 and at least four times more than in
1993. That year, only 466 new pilots landed jobs with airlines, according
to AIR Inc., an Atlanta-based company specializing in airline career
development.
   New, entry-level airlines hired less than 100 pilots in 1995, compared
with 288 in 1994.
   Regional airline hiring also decreased last year, however, to about
1,700 cockpit crewmembers compared with 2,566 in 1994. Larger regionals
operating jet-powered transports hired about 1,600 new pilots. In 1994 they
hired 2,015.
   Of the 76,000 pilots actively flying for U.S. airlines, the number of
pilots on furlough declined to about 1,950 at the end of last year.
   Five major airlines account for 85% of that number, including American,
USAir, Delta, America West and Continental. Most of these carriers plan to
recall at least some of their furloughed pilots throughout this year.
   In addition, less than 50% of new airline pilots hired in 1995 had
military backgrounds. The decline reflects the shrinking pool of military
pilots available to the airline industry. In the past 20 years, about 75%
of all new-hire pilots came from the military, according to AIR Inc.

RUSSIA LAUNCHES U.S. MILITARY RESEARCH SATELLITE

A U. S. spacecraft sponsored in part by the Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization (BMDO) has been launched by a Russian booster that also
carried an Earth resources satellite for India.
   The 550 lb. U.S. ``Skipper'' spacecraft was launched Dec. 28 from the
Baikonur Cosmodrome on board a Russian SL-6 booster that also carried the
larger Indian IRS-C imaging satellite. The Skipper satellite was placed
into the same initial 500-mi. orbit used by the Indian satellite. But
ground controllers at the U.S. Air Force satellite control facility in
Sunnyvale, Calif., will fire Skipper's hydrazine thrusters to lower it
gradually into an 80 X 90-mi. orbit inclined 97 deg. From that extremely
low orbit, the spacecraft will be used for BMDO-related aerobraking and
aerothermal chemistry studies related to the performance of reentry
vehicles entering the atmosphere.
   The satellite's instrument section containing spectrometers and
photometers was developed by Utah State University, while the satellite bus
was developed by the Moscow Aviation Institute and NPO Lavotchkin near
Moscow.

C-17S FLY LONG-RANGE AIR DROP MISSION

By:
DAVID HUGHES

(BOSTON)
Two U.S. Air Force C-17s completed the first strategic air drop from this
model transport by flying 147 Army Rangers nonstop from Ft. Benning, Ga.,
to Egypt for a mass parachute drop.
   The aircraft flew recently from Lawson Army Airfield (Ga.) to a drop
zone near Cairo (loading troops photo center right). The 14.5-hr. flight
covered 6,400 naut. mi. and involved refueling from a KC-10 enroute (top
right). The C-17s descended to low level to drop members of the 3rd
Battalion, 75th U.S. Army Ranger Regiment from 800 ft. above the ground
(photo below). The soldiers were participating in Bright Star '95, a
U.S./Egyptian exercise. The C-17s were from the 437th Military Airlift Wing
at Charleston AFB, S.C.
   Col. Jack Pledger, deputy director of plans at Air Mobility Command
headquarters, said this small scale exercise shows how a larger number of
C-17s could air drop an Army brigade-size unit. He noted that six C-17s
also demonstrated this capability over the summer. The first four C-17s in
the formation dropped equipment while the next two carried paratroopers.
   The C-17 is also designed to fly into austere airfields for airland
operations and is now being used in Bosnia. All 120 of the aircraft will be
equipped with AAR-47 missile attack warning systems and ALE-47 flare
dispensers for self-protection.
   Pledger said the Air Force has received 23 C-17s and may be receiving as
many as 15 per year if plans for an accelerated multiyear acquisition are
approved. The Air Force was directed by the Defense Acquisition Board to
find the most favorable production rate. Pledger said the Air Force expects
some savings if the plan is approved since parts can be purchased in large
quantities to reduce costs. Also, five production C-17s used in the flight
test program are being reconfigured for delivery to operational squadrons.
If the accelerated plan is approved, the last of 120 C-17s would be
delivered in 2003.

F/A-18 DROP MODEL TESTS TO BEGIN

By:
EDWARD H. PHILLIPS
LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER, VA.

Flight tests of an F/A-18E/F drop model scheduled to begin soon will
provide important data on stall, post-stall and spin recovery
characteristics applicable to the full-scale aircraft's upcoming flight
test program.
   Mark A. Croom, drop model program manager at Langley's Vehicle Dynamics
Branch, expects the first drop to occur in March or April. The model will
be flown chiefly to explore the low-speed envelope, with a particular
emphasis on stall and post-stall regimes. The flights will also reliably
predict a vehicle's behavior during large amplitude or highly dynamic
conditions such as spin entry, he said.
   Plans call for making about 50 flights with the model during the
three-year program. The majority of drops will be made from 12,000 ft. or
less, and will last about 90 sec. Upgraded display and control consoles
will allow the model's flight crew to reconfigure the control system ``on
the fly,'' thereby maximizing the amount of research achieved per flight.
   In addition to being 25% larger than the F/A-18C/D, the F/A-18E/F design
incorporates subtle changes that may cause ``significant differences in
high-alpha flight dynamic behavior,'' Croom said. He cited the aircraft's
modified wing leading-edge extensions, for example, which may alter
vortical flows and thereby change spin recovery characteristics compared
with the original design.
   A smaller model of the F/A-18E/F has been tested in Langley's 20-ft.
Vertical Spin Tunnel to help determine developed spin and spin recovery
characteristics. The drop model flights will augment that work, according
to Croom.
   A NONPOWERED, 22%-SCALE F/A-18E/F drop model, which has a wing span of
nearly 10 ft., has been completed by Newport News, Va.-based Dynamic
Engineering Inc. and delivered to Langley for systems integration. During
the next few months, the 400-lb. vehicle will be fitted with 400 lb. of
instrumentation and other special equipment, increasing its drop weight to
about 900 lb. That includes ballast to give the model correct mass
characteristics for scaling.
   NASA researchers also want to use information from the drop flights to
refine the program's aerodynamic data base, and to formulate control laws
designed to enhance handling qualities of the full-scale airplane.
   NASA's F/A-18E/F drop model program began about three years ago when
design of the U.S. Air Force F-22 advanced tactical fighter and Navy
F/A-18E/F were well underway. Plans originally called for testing an F-22
drop model, but funding was inadequate and the program was terminated.
Although the Vehicle Dynamics Branch would prefer to conduct at least two
drop model programs simultaneously, limited money permits only one.
   Langley recently concluded drop tests of an X-31 model after conducting
25 flights during a two-year period. The longest of these was 128 sec. Two
final drops were made last autumn to evaluate differential action of the
canards for yaw control at high angles of attack. Using differential
pressure along the fuselage forebody, the canards ``proved as effective as
thrust vectoring'' to control directional movement, according to Croom.
   For the final flight, most of the aircraft's vertical stabilizer had
been removed to gather data to validate wind tunnel studies. Without the
stabilizer, directional control was lost at about 25 deg. angle of attack,
he said.
   In addition to the upcoming F/A-18E/F flights, the Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA) is considering a follow-on, drop model program for
the X-31 or another aircraft type chiefly to evaluate flow control devices
activated by microelectronic machines. ARPA sponsored the X-31 flights and
is involved, along with the U.S. Navy, in the F/A-18E/F drop model
program.
   To improve launch capability for the upcoming flights, Langley
researchers have modified a Bell UH-1 aircraft by installing landing gear
skids that are higher and wider than the original unit. Previously, models
were suspended from an outrigger-type mount on the right side of the
aircraft. Although the system worked, it caused pilot workload to escalate
significantly during takeoff and landing.
   THE NEW SKIDS, WHICH WERE obtained by NASA from storage at Davis-Monthan
AFB, had been installed on a small number of specially modified UH-1
helicopters operated by the U.S. Army. They allow drop models to be carried
beneath the helicopter's fuselage and directly on its center of gravity,
which greatly improves launch operations as well as safety during takeoff
and landing, Croom said. A zero-impulse bolt (ZIB) is used to release the
model. The ZIB imparts virtually no force to the model during release.
   Langley researchers plan to conduct the F/A-18E/F drop flights from the
island side of NASA/Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Va.
Previously, all drop model tests were based at Langley's Plum Tree Test
Range in a wetland region near the research center.
   During the next three years, Croom expects to install two small turbojet
engines in the F/A-18E/F drop model for a series of powered flights. Each
engine would be rated at about 280-lb. static thrust.
   To learn the water recovery techniques necessary at Wallops, NASA has
conferred with the U.S. Navy's program to launch and recover BQM-74 target
drones near Virginia Beach, Va. The key challenge for Croom's team,
however, was to learn how to seal models properly to prevent salt water
intrusion.
   Tests using the X-31 model demonstrated that the relatively ``soft''
water landings caused little or no damage to the vehicle. The F/A-18E/F
model will feature special salt water sensors designed to sever parachute
lines quickly upon landing. Rapid separation of the risers prevents
underwater inflation of the 63-ft.-dia. parachute, and subsequent sinking
of the $1-million vehicle. n

S-76BS TO THE RESCUE IN JAPAN

By:
PAUL PROCTOR

(SEATTLE)
A Sikorsky S-76B helicopter operated by the fire- and disaster-response
aviation unit of Japan's Niigata Prefecture performs training exercises in
the mountains surrounding the Lichinokura Reservoir. These include
rappelling (photo, below left), rescue (photo, lower right) and precision
forest fire water drops with a 240-gal. external bucket (photo, upper
right).
   The port city of Niigata is located on the western edge of central
Japan's narrow coastal plain and is hemmed in by mountains as near as
32-mi. away and up to 7,000-ft. high. The mountain scenery is a magnet for
nature lovers and the Niigata City-based helicopter unit is called to
evacuate injured hikers. It also is equipped to perform coastal search and
rescue and will provide back-up emergency services to the 1996 Winter
Olympic Games, to be held in neighboring Nagano Prefecture.
   Entering service in April, the 11,700-lb. gross weight S-76B quickly
distinguished itself when torrential rains in July caused flash flooding
and landslides. In the storm's aftermath, hundreds of residents in Niigata
Prefecture were isolated without electrical power, according to Makoto
Watanabe, unit commander.
   In one 5-hr. period the S-76B evacuated 212 people, making 19 round
trips in difficult weather. The twin-engine helicopter operated from an
advanced site complete with refueling capability to avoid ferry time to its
Niigata Airport base.
   The helicopter flew several other missions over the five days following
the sm, Watanabe said. These included rapid identification of highway
damage, downed bridges and power lines. The S-76B also provided timely
transportation of disaster response experts, relief teams and emergency
supplies. Community needs quickly were identified where conventional
communications links were down.
   Niigata's S-76B is configured with a rescue hoist and provisions for
four litter positions, Nightsun searchlight, public address speaker and
snow skis for winter operations. It is flown by contract pilots from Aero
Asahi Corp., Japan's largest private helicopter operator.
   A second S-76B, ordered at the same time, is operational with Yamanashi
Prefecture, located at the base of Mt. Fuji. It is equipped with a
television communications broadcast system and forward-looking infrared
(Flir) camera. In July, it rescued an injured teenager in mountainous
terrain at an altitude of 9,400-ft.
   Niigata unit operations normally are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. daily.
Aircraft currently are flown single-pilot, with a mechanic seated in the
copilot's position as a safety coordinator and observer. The addition of
night flights is under study but would require two-pilot crews. Typical
duty staffing includes the aircraft captain, an engineer, a mechanic, a
dispatcher and four to six specially trained rescue crew.
   Niigata Prefecture purchased the S-76B with a subsidy provided by
Japan's Ministry of Home Affairs.
   Both helicopters are powered by twin Pratt & Whitney PT6B-36
turboshafts.

CRM FOR ONE

By:

CREW RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES can be modified and effectively
incorporated into training for single-pilot helicopter operations,
according to a report by the Flight Safety Foundation, Arlington, Va.
Although concepts must be applied differently when only one pilot is
involved, the basic CRM principles of efficiently seeking and evaluating
information, overcoming communications barriers and being assertive at
appropriate times remain the same. Other CRM training benefits for the
single-pilot cockpit include workload management and recognizing and
preventing distraction.

A PROTOTYPE OPEN-ARCHITECTURE MACHINE tool controller is being tested in
trials at major U.S. corporations. Boeing plans to become a factory-floor
testbed soon. Developed by the Commerce Dept.'s National Institute of
Standards and Technology, the enhanced machine controller (EMC) allows
screen displays to be tailored to the operator's preference or previous
experience and simplifies modifications and upgrades. Potential payoffs
include reduced employee retraining, ``plug and play'' hardware and
software compatibility, and an expanded supplier pool, according to
Frederick Proctor, NIST robotics researcher, Washington. EMC-equipped
machine tools also should enhance manufacturing line flexibility.

LASERS HIGH AND LOW

By:

A HIGH-AVERAGE POWER, SOLID-STATE LASER developed by Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory, Calif., will be used by the U.S. Navy to identify and track
satellites. The frequency-doubled, green beam is one of the brightest
lasers available. It can be precisely pointed yet diverges to a beam just a
few yards across after traveling hundreds of miles, according to Lloyd
Hackel, associate program leader for commercial lasers. A version of the
laser also quickly removes paint from aircraft and ships without harming
the substrate. The method vaporizes a small amount of paint and creates a
plasma which in turn generates an intense acoustic wave to perform the
stripping.

A340 BREAKTHROUGH

By:
COMPILED BY FRANCES FIORINO

AIRBUS HAS MADE AN A340 BREAKTHROUGH IN CHINA. Air China is in final
negotiations to acquire three aircraft. Whether the A340s will come from
the stock of six that China Aviation Supplies Corp. (CASC), the country's
purchasing agent, already has on order is unclear. Also unclear is whether
they will be configured for VIPs or passengers. Airbus wants the aircraft
in passenger configuration to broaden its market impact beyond the five
A340s ordered by China Eastern. Two years ago, Airbus thought it had an
A340 sale to China Southern, but a turf battle erupted between the airline
and the CASC over who was doing the ordering. The upshot was that China
Southern remains a firm Boeing customer--including Seattle's first for the
777. Air China also is likely to place 10 777 orders early this year.

REDUCING INJURIES

By:
COMPILED BY FRANCES FIORINO

A VARIATION IN PASSENGER ``BRACE'' POSITION can have a significant effect
on the magnitude and type of injuries sustained during aircraft landing
accidents, especially as new 16g seats come on-line. Extensive research
following the January, 1989, Boeing 737-400 accident in Kegworth, England,
found fewer ``leg flail'' injuries occur when passengers in the brace
position place their lower legs slightly aft of the vertical, or
knee-joints, with feet flat on the floor. A report summary by Arlington,
Va.-based Flight Safety Foundation includes recommendations for
high-friction carpeting to inhibit leg sliding and a review of under-seat
luggage bar design.

BACK TO BOSNIA

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

UNMANNED RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT WILL RESUME operations over Bosnia and
Croatia in mid-March, instead of Jan. 1 as some senior officials wanted.
That gives program officials extra time to train with and devise tactics
for the new Synthetic Aperture Radar, which allows the Predator UAV to
observe the troubled region even through thick winter cloud cover. Three
Predators likely will operate from a base near Sarmellek, Hungary, about
130 mi. northwest of the main U.S. base in Tuzla, Bosnia. Also, Pentagon
acquisition chief Paul Kaminski finally has ruled that the long-endurance
UAVs will be operated by the Air Force, unless they are ship-based.

HURRY UP, SHORTY

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

THERE IS A NEW HURRY-UP COMPETITION and limited development program for a
smaller, short-range UAV that can operate as a land or ship-based scout.
Demand for the 3-4-hr. endurance, 120-mi. range aircraft is intense enough
that Kaminski has designated the Tactical UAV (TUAV) project an Advanced
Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD). The new ACTD, under which 32 UAVs
would be produced initially, combines requirements for the close and
maneuver UAVs into a single aircraft. The TUAV is projected to cost
$300,000-350,000 per aircraft, including the electro-optical and infrared
sensor package.

PAY UP, UNCLE

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

CONTRACTORS FOR THE CANCELED A-12 Navy strike aircraft--McDonnell Douglas
and General Dynamics--are due back in Federal Claims Court this week to
make their pitches for just how much the Navy owes them. Predictions of the
award for each range from $350 million-1 billion (see p. 11). The two
companies filed a lawsuit four years ago, seeking to change the terms of
the A-12 cancellation from ``terminated for default,'' which means no
reimbursement for some expenses. Late last month, Judge Robert Hodges ended
the trial after three weeks, ruling the A-12 had been canceled ``for the
convenience of the government.''

WHEN IN DOUBT APPOINT A PANEL

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

HOUSE-SENATE INTELLIGENCE CONFEREES have agreed to temporarily set aside
the contentious issue of whether to begin procurement of a new generation
of smaller reconnaissance satellites (AW&ST Nov. 13, 1995, p. 24). Their
compromise calls for the appointment of a panel of experts. By May 1, the
panel is to determine whether ``smallsats'' can be procured immediately, as
proponents in the House contend, or whether several more years of
technology development is needed, as the Senate and National Reconnaissance
Office maintain. The compromise cleared the way--finally--for the full
House and Senate to approve a Fiscal 1996 intelligence authorization bill
shortly before they adjourned for their holiday break.

POLITICAL SCIENCE

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

REP. F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER, JR. (R.-Wis.) may have some tough choices to
make. He is the odds-on favorite to succeed the House Science Committee
chairman, Robert Walker (R.-Pa.), next year following Walker's stunning
announcement last month that he will not seek reelection. But another
member's planned retirement also could put Sensenbrenner in line to chair
a House Judiciary subcommittee--a prospect the lawyer-turned-lawmaker has
eyed with relish in the past. A Republican caucus will make the final
appointments, but in any case new House rules limit lawmakers to one
chairmanship apiece.

NOT PROBLEMS, JUST CHALLENGES

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

AFTER EXAMINING TECHNOLOGY development for reusable launch vehicles, a
National Research Council panel gives NASA and the industry teams on the
X-33 demonstrator program generally favorable marks. But the panel sees
some tough technical problems: Pushing the performance of either the Space
Shuttle Main Engine or the Russian RD-0120 engine enough will be ``an
extremely difficult challenge.'' Both welding and repairing the
aluminum-lithium 2195 alloy for tanks are ``major areas of concern.'' And
health monitoring systems and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques
are not laid out in ``a well-ordered program to identify which measurements
will be made or how NDE will be used to penetrate multiple layers of
material.''

THE U.S. AIR FORCE

By:
EDITED BY BRUCE D. NORDWALL

THE U.S. AIR FORCE PLANS TO EQUIP its RC-135 Advanced Range Instrumentation
Aircraft (ARIA) at Edwards AFB with a satellite communication link. The
service has contracted to equip five aircraft with the Honeywell/Racal
multichannel MCS-6000 satcom system under a $3.5-million contract.
Honeywell sees the system, developed for commercial air transport and
business jets, as a foot in the door for military applications. The Air
Force used its C-135 Speckled Trout aircraft to test the ability of a
number of systems, including this one, to communicate with Inmarsat C
satellites in flights over both poles (AW&ST Apr. 4, 1994, p. 66). The
Honeywell/Racal team spent the last year developing the STU-3 secure voice
interface with the communications management unit, which gained Inmarsat
approval in January, 1995. The MCS-6000 system is currently in use on
Gulfstreams and a number of wide-body airline fleets. The ARIA fleet will
use the Tecom T-4000 high-gain antenna system.

THE FAA'S GPS LOCAL AREA AUGMENTATION SYSTEM

By:
EDITED BY BRUCE D. NORDWALL

THE FAA'S GPS LOCAL AREA AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (LAAS) could be delayed if key
decisions on requirements and standards are not made soon, according to the
Air Transport Assn. of America (ATA). LAAS is being developed to provide
the accuracy needed for automatic landings to touchdown under the worst
weather conditions. But without decisions on LAAS standards, the first
aircraft operators who install GPS equipment run the risk of having to redo
their installations when the characteristics are nailed down. Choice of
data link is a key issue. Roger Fleming, ATA president, recently told the
House subcommittee on aviation that there are two frequencies that are
about equally good for LAAS--VHF and GPS L1. If the FAA does not make a
choice soon, he suggested that Chairman John J. Duncan, Jr. (R.-Tenn.) flip
a coin and choose one.

MALAYSIA CONSIDERS CL-415 FOR DUAL ROLE

By:
DAVID HUGHES
MICHAEL MECHAM

(BOSTONLANGKAWI, MALAYSIA)
The government of Malaysia is considering a proposal from Bombardier for
several CL-415s for coastal patrol and aerial fire-fighting.
   The CL-415s would be equipped with a radar, Flir and searchlights, but
they also could be configured to perform their traditional fire-fighting
role.
   The aircraft can scoop 6,100 liters (1,600 gal.) in 12 sec. from a lake
or ocean, drop the water on a fire and then repeat the process. The
aircraft also can convert the water to foam by injecting chemicals into
it.
   A CL-415 flew daily exhibitions last month at the Langkawi International
Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition in Malaysia after already appearing in
Turkey, Greece, Lebanon, Syria, Cyprus and the Dubai air show. Its next air
show appearance will be in February at Asian Aerospace `96 in Singapore.
   Bombardier's five-month, 21-nation tour is part of a multimillion-dollar
effort to demonstrate the capabilities of the aircraft in various
roles--including fire-fighting, maritime surveillance, search-and-rescue
and environmental monitoring. The tour will also take the 415 to Indonesia,
the Philippines, Japan and Taiwan. Bombardier is leasing the demonstrator
aircraft from the province of Quebec, Canada, and has repainted it. SISAM,
a subsidiary of Alitalia, is providing the flight crews. SISAM operates a
fleet of CL-415s and CL-215s in Italy.
   Ray Mathieu, marketing director for Canadair's Amphibious Aircraft Div.,
said the CL-415 demonstrations at Langkawi were made to the Maritime
Enforcement Coordinating Center and the Royal Malaysian Air Force. The air
force would operate the aircraft for the coordinating center if CL-415s are
acquired.
   Japanese authorities became interested in the airplane after the Kobe
earthquake, which caused disastrous fires last January. Mathieu said
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is now assisting Bombardier in marketing the
415 in Japan. This arrangement grew out of Mitsubishi's relationship as a
risk-sharing partner on the Global Express and de Havilland Dash 8. CL-215T
turboprop- and CL-215 piston-powered aircraft have been leased in recent
years by several U.S. states.
   The CL-215Ts are turboprop aircraft created in a retrofit program in
which piston engines were replaced. These aircraft do not have the glass
cockpit of the newly manufactured CL-415. Two CL-215Ts were evaluated for
two months in 1994 during fire season by the Los Angles County Fire Dept.,
and two more are being evaluated now.
   The two CL-215Ts on duty in Los Angeles can be airborne 5 min. after a
fire alarm is received and are being used primarily to fight wild fires in
urban areas. Representatives from the Japan National Fire Research
Institute recently observed the 215Ts fighting fires in the Los Angeles
area.
   Darrell Higuchi, deputy chief of the Los Angeles County Fire Dept., said
the county probably will continue to lease aircraft each year for 60-90
days during brush fire season when the Santa Ana winds are a factor. There
are many bodies of water in the county, as well as the nearby ocean, where
the aircraft can scoop water. About 80% have boat traffic, but local
agreements call for lakes and reservoirs to be cleared for scooping
operations if necessary. Higuchi said the 215Ts make 6-20 airdrops of water
per hour on a fire.
   Bombardier also worked with the Swedish Coast Guard last summer to
demonstrate a CL-215 in the dual role of fire-fighting and coastal patrol,
with the intent of Sweden looking at the CL-415 later.
   One element of the Swedish demonstrations was pollution monitoring,
according to James Cherry, president of Canadair's Amphibious Aircraft Div.
By landing in the water near vessels suspected of discharging their bilges
illegally, the aircraft can collect samples for later analysis. Bombardier
officials said the evaluation may continue this summer.
   The Canadian company has delivered two CL-415s to Quebec, four to Italy
and seven to France, and is building about 10 of the aircraft per year. The
aircraft costs $18 million and is powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada
PW123AF turboprop engines.

opportunity in Asia to demonstrate its CL-415 water bomber in action. The
aircraft's next show is in Singapore, but it won't be able to drop water

MALAYSIAN STARTUP EYES ECO-TOURISM

By:
MICHAEL MECHAM

(LANGKAWI, MALAYSIA)
Saeaga Airlines is banking on eco-tourism to feed an unusual route network
that crosses the island borders of eastern Malaysia, the southern
Philippines and Indonesia to reach unspoiled and renowned destinations.
   Saeaga will begin charter operations in January and scheduled services
this spring using two de Havilland Dash 8s and a Canadair Regional Jet
flying from a home base in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, to Davao and General
Santos in the southern Philippines and Manado in north Sulawesi,
Indonesia.
   The aircraft sale, which is valued at $49 million, marks the first use
by a single operator outside Canada of the Dash 8 and RJ. De Havilland also
placed four Dash 8-200s and two Dash 8-300s with another Malaysian
regional, Pelangi Air, during LIMA `95 here. These were the first
placements of Dash 8s in Malaysia, bringing to 42 the total orders for the
Asia/Pacific region. It is also the first sale of an RJ in the region.
   Cross-border flight operations are jealously guarded by national
carriers, which often do not operate 50-seat aircraft, whether turboprop or
jet. As a result, the cities may be under-served by the tourist market
simply because connections for foreigners are a burden.
   Saeaga will buck this trend, taking advantage of a memorandum signed
last February by Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines to promote
regional trade opportunities, including air travel, in what is called the
East Asean Growth Area.
   Kota Kinabalu is an established tourist destination, but other Malaysian
cities, such as Miri, are harder to reach. Miri is about 100 mi. from the
Sarawak Chamber, said to be the world's largest cave system. The region
offers rain forests and excellent diving in ``untouched'' locations.
   ``This region is undeveloped for air routes,'' said Rob Greatbatch of
Airtrade Aviation Consultants in Singapore.
   Airtrade and another consultancy, EAA Malaysia, are establishing the
airline on behalf of its owners, Ekran Berhad, a Malaysian company with
interests in hotels, and the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.
Ekran also operates Sabah Air and Ekran Air, which will turn over their
routes in the region now being served by helicopters.
   Part of the consultants' tasks will be to find a permanent management
team. Recruitment of flight and cabin crews has already begun.
   Saeaga's strategy is based on the top-end tourist market from the U.S.
and Europe that wants to see unspoiled natural areas. For those seeking the
unusual, Greatbatch suggests that diving in the Spratly Islands is a
possibility.
   Since Saeaga will offer some competition to the region's national
carriers, it will look to airlines outside the area, such as in Singapore
and Hong Kong, for booking agreements. The marketing strategy is that
Saeaga will extend their tourism packages. But much of the airline's
success will depend on development of tourist facilities in places like
Balikpapan, Pontianak, Zamboanga and Tarakan.
   Saeaga's Dash 8-200 will be flown in a one-class, 37-seat configuration.
Its 300 will have 50 seats, as will the Canadair Regional Jet.

MALAYSIANS SEEK KUALA LUMPUR HUB

(LANGKAWI, MALAYSIA)
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad says Kuala Lumpur's new airport should try
to equal Singapore's better known Changi Airport and become a regional
hub.
   That will be a stiff challenge since Changi is regarded as one of the
world's best. But Mahathir says the transformation of the nation's economy
from a simple supplier of raw materials--chiefly rubber and tin--into a
supplier of manufactured goods will support such a goal. Malaysia's economy
has had an average annual growth of at least 8% for the past eight years,
and manufactured goods now account for 80% of its exports.
   Emphasizing Kuala Lumpur as a regional hub would help Malaysia Airlines
grow, give Malaysia greater bargaining power in international air services
negotiations, and help serve as an anchor for Mahathir's Vision 2020
program to promote the country's development of a manufacturing base.
   That strategy assumes that Kuala Lumpur's present airport at Subang will
become a prime industrial location for aerospace manufacturing. The airport
will remain active for military, police and maintenance/overhaul activities
but be closed to passengers once the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport
at Sepang opens.
   However, Malaysia is a skeptic about an ``open skies'' air services
policy. Singapore has the opposite view and serves as a pass-through hub
for numerous foreign carriers, particularly from Europe and the U.S., on
destinations elsewhere in Southeast Asia and Australasia.
   Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said Singapore would not maintain a
competitive advantage because of its more liberal policy. ``I don't think
many countries offer open skies,'' Liong Sik said during the recent
aerospace conference here sponsored by AVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY and
the Asian Strategy & Leadership Institute. ``Other countries haven't
offered open skies to Singapore.''
   The new airport at Sepang is 30 mi. south of Kuala Lumpur and is
regarded as the largest single project undertaken by the Malaysian
government. Built on a greenfield site of 25,000 acres, it will cost an
estimated 13 billion ringgit ($5.3 billion) and is to open by January,
1998.
   First-phase construction includes a main terminal of 246,333 sq. meters
(2.65 million sq. ft.), two 4,000-meter (13,120-ft.) runways with an
8,000-ft. separation, and 80 gates and remote aircraft stands. Annual
capacity is expected to be 25 million at opening and 60 million by 2020.
The site is large enough to accommodate 90 million passengers.
   The Sepang airport's opening will close Kuala Lumpur's smaller airport
at Sungei Besi, which had been proposed as a city airport for regional
services. But Liong Sik says Sungei Besi is to be converted for
development.

GULFSTREAM RAMPS UP G5 TEST PROGRAM
The Gulfstream 5 features new engines and a new wing--the aircraft is
14,400 lb. heavier and flies 6,000 ft. higher than its predecessor, the
G4SP.

By:
PAUL PROCTOR

(SEATTLE)
Gulfstream is spooling up its G5 flight test program with a goal of
obtaining FAA certification in October and comparable European
authorization by year-end.
   A second G5, serial no. 502, already has begun ground-based static
testing at Gulfstream Aerospace's Savannah, Ga., factory. The next G5 to
become airborne, serial no. 503, is scheduled to lift off later this
month.
   Gulfstream's first G5, serial No. 501, performed a successful 1 hr. 18
min. maiden flight from Savannah on Nov. 28 (AW&ST Dec. 4, 1995, p. 101).
The demonstration put Gulfstream solidly on track in the race to bring to
market the world's first, 6,500-naut.-mi.-range luxury business jet. More
importantly, Gulfstream retained about a one-year lead on competitor
Bombardier's all-new Global Express.
   Gulfstream claims more than a $2-billion backlog for the Gulfstream G5,
which will cost more than $35 million, complete with customized passenger
interior, avionics and exterior paint. Bombardier said it holds more than
40 orders for the Global Express, which is of similar range and price.
   A total of four G5s will participate in flight test and certification
flying, according to Lee Johnson, director of flight test operations. The
third aircraft to fly, serial no. 504, is scheduled to become airborne in
February. The fourth aircraft in the flight test fleet, no. 505, is to fly
in June.
   As of mid-December, the pioneer G5 had accumulated 8.4 hr. of air time
over four flights. Testing was interrupted to install a trailing-cone
assembly and a stall/spin chute. The latter will be used later in the
program during stall characterization work.
   Initial test points already logged include stability, control and
handling checks over a variety of flight regimes. Aircraft speed has ranged
from 130% of estimated stall speed to 300 kt. and altitudes as high as
20,000 ft. have been achieved, Johnson said.
   The flights were ``smooth and problem-free'' and the aircraft handled
well, John O'Meara, chief test pilot, said.
   The function of every system on board the aircraft, many of them all-new
or significant updates from the predecessor G4SP, also has been checked,
Johnson said. Initial confirmation of aircraft aerodynamic projections has
been performed and brief autopilot tests run. The flaps and landing gear
successfully have been cycled.
   Performance of the G5's twin 14,700-lb.-thrust BMW Rolls-Royce BR710-48
powerplants also is being closely monitored. The G5 is the first aircraft
to be powered by the all-new engine series. Evaluations include ``rapid
reversal'' throttle changes and throttle ``slams.'' Thrust reversers have
been deployed on every landing.
   Through the remainder of the flight test program the no. 501 G5 is
expected to continue to expand the performance envelope, including the
type's planned top altitude of 51,000 ft. and maximum operating speed of
Mach 0.9. A stall series is planned to be performed to evaluate the
aircraft's new, high-performance wing.
   OVERALL, THE G5 has a projected maximum takeoff weight of 89,000 lb.,
compared with the G4SP's 74,600 lb. Maximum cruise altitude is 6,000 ft.
higher than the G4SP and cruise speed is slightly faster at Mach 0.88.
Despite flying heavier, faster and higher, the G5's new wing is expected to
require a Mach trim system only at speeds of Mach 0.85 and above, if at
all, Johnson said.
   Fuselage structure also has been beefed up to provide a 6,000-ft. cabin
at 51,000-ft. This compares with 6,500 ft. at 45,000-ft. for the G4SP.
   Gulfstream serial no. 503 will be used to closely evaluate the function
and reliability of aircraft systems including fuel, electrical, hydraulics
and brakes. It will perform additional flight control tests and verify
braking and steering.
   This aircraft probably will fly to 3,700-ft.-high Roswell, N.M., this
June for takeoff and landing performance trials. It also is the likely
choice to shuttle to Fairbanks, Alaska, for cold weather tests in early
March.
   The third G5 to join the flight test program, serial no. 504, will be
used to closely examine engine and aerodynamic performance. The latter task
includes in-flight analysis and verification of estimated flight and
structural loads, Johnson said. This airframe also will be used to verify
noise footprint, with measurements to be performed at a small airport
outside Savannah.
   Gulfstream also plans to use the aircraft to conduct icing trials this
spring, weather conditions permitting.
   G5 no. 504 also will evaluate cabin environmental system performance
including pressurization, ventilation, heating and cooling, Johnson said.
Equipment cooling will be examined during planned hot weather tests in
Savannah and possibly Roswell or El Centro, Calif.
   G5 serial no. 505 will perform required HIRF (High Intensity Radiated
Field) and lightning strike tests. An FAA pilot will be on board for
certain function and reliability and crew-workload tests needed for
certification.
   Overall, about 1,700 hr. of G5 flight test is planned, Johnson said. At
the height of activity, the test program will employ about 110 full-time
workers, including technicians, engineers, support personnel and six
pilots. n

GLOBAL EXPRESS SEEKS SPEED EDGE

By:
DAVID HUGHES

(BOSTON)
Bombardier is beginning to assemble the first long-range Global Express
business jet and will receive the wing and wing box/center fuselage from
Mitsubishi later this month as the company prepares for a first flight in
September.
   John Lawson, president of the Canadair Business Aircraft Div., said the
all-new business jet will be certified to the same standards as the Boeing
777 and will meet extended twin-engine operations (ETOPS) criteria such as
systems architecture and redundancy. Like the 777, Global Express is being
developed on IBM/Dassault Systemes Catia computer-aided design
workstations. Data are being exchanged via satellite communications among
the various partners, including Bombardier's Canadair, de Havilland and
Short Brothers units, as well as Mitsubishi in Japan.
   The Gulfstream 5 completed its first flight in November, giving it
nearly a year lead over the Global Express. But Lawson notes the Bombardier
aircraft has a number of advantages in the competition, such as a larger
cabin and better range at high Mach numbers. While both the Global Express
and Gulfstream 5 fly 6,500 naut. mi. at Mach 0.80, the Global Express is
expected to fly nearly as far (6,330 naut. mi.) at Mach 0.85. The aircraft
is also expected to fly 5,000 naut. mi. at Mach 0.88. ``Gulfstream knows
how difficult it will be to compete with this aircraft once we fly,'' he
said.
   Demand for the Global Express prompted the Bombardier board of directors
last year to add 12 more aircraft to the early production schedule--six in
fiscal 1998 and six in 1999. The company has received firm orders for the
first six additional aircraft since availability was announced last June.
   In all, Bombardier has announced more than 40 firm orders. This includes
sales in the Middle East where TAG Aeronautics, its exclusive distributor,
converted four options to firm orders at the Dubai air show in November.
This brings TAG's total orders to 10. Bombardier officials said the actual
figure for Global Express orders is ``well in excess'' of 44.
   Lawson also expects to see a government market develop for the aircraft
after it is in production. The aircraft could be used to transport heads of
state or high-ranking government officials.
   Military versions are also possible. Lawson said Bombardier is
interested in supplying aircraft for the U.K.'s Airborne Standoff Radar
(Astor) surveillance aircraft program. Teams led by Loral Europe Ltd. and
Raytheon are analyzing a variety of aircraft as possible high-altitude
surveillance platforms during a 17-month project definition phase being
funded by the British Ministry of Defense. When configured as a business
jet, Global Express can climb directly to 43,000 ft. starting at maximum
takeoff weight, Lawson said. It has a ceiling of 51,000 ft.The aircraft has
two generators for each engine, two batteries and an APU, so it has ample
power for the mission, according to Bombardier.
   The corporate version of the Global Express costs $29.5 million
``green,'' and the typical price for an interior will be $3.5 million.
Bombardier's completion center at Tucson, Ariz., will be actively competing
for Global Express interior work, but customers will be at liberty to pick
other suppliers.
   Lawson noted that the Tucson facility recently completed the interior of
the first Canadair Special Edition (a modified Regional Jet), which has a
cabin about the same size as Global Express'. The Special Edition interior
weighs 5,750 lb. in a 46.2-ft.-long cabin, versus the 6,000 lb. allowed for
Global Express' 48-ft. cabin. Lawson said the Special Edition interior
shows that Bombardier's weight allowance for Global Express completion is
sufficient. The Special Edition interior was designed for the TAG Group, a
Middle Eastern customer.
   THE FIRST GLOBAL EXPRESS FORWARD fuselage barrel arrived in Montreal
late last month and is being mated to the nose. This assembly will then be
shipped to de Havilland at Downsview, Ontario, where Global Express
production will take place. Mitsubishi will deliver its first wing and wing
box/center fuselage section from Nagoya, Japan, to Downsview in late
January. These components will be mated by late February. All aircraft
sections should be assembled by late March or early April. The tail and
rear fuselage are being built by de Havilland.
   Bombardier also is completing an integrated systems test rig at
Downsview. This will be used to test the Honeywell Primus 2000XP integrated
avionics suite, the Sextant flight control system, as well as hydraulic and
electrical systems. Testing of hardware and computer software is expected
to reduce technical risk.
   Lawson noted that Bombardier has a good track record in bringing
aircraft to market as promised, as shown with five aircraft during the past
five years. The company is now producing 140 aircraft per year, making it
the fifth largest producer of civil aircraft worldwide, according to
Lawson. And the Regional Jet, the Challenger 604 and the Lear 60 all
exceeded expectations as far as initial performance guarantees. Now that
wind tunnel tests are complete, Bombardier has reduced the 5,540-ft.
(1,689-meter) balanced field length estimate for Global Express by 440 ft.
to 5,100 ft. (1,554 meters). This is at maximum takeoff weight, at sea
level with standard (ISA) temperatures.
   At Dubai, Bombardier also said the manufacturer's empty weight for the
aircraft is now guaranteed at 40,700 lb. (18,462 kg.) 2%. With the
6,000-lb. (2,720-kg.) outfitting allowance, the empty weight comes up to
46,700 lb. (21,183 kg.). Global Express also achieves relatively low
takeoff and approach speeds at maximum weights with both slats and flaps on
the wings. Approach speed at maximum landing weight is 125 kt. and rotation
speed at maximum takeoff weight is 130 kt.
   Bombardier officials believe there is a market for 550-850 long-range
business aircraft and said sales to date have been solid. ``These are not
phantom deposits,'' Lawson said.

SALE OF DEFENSE UNIT NOT IN TI'S CARDS

By:
ANTHONY L. VELOCCI, JR.

(NEW YORK)
Texas Instruments' aerospace and defense business is considered by many
industry observers a prime candidate for the auction block, but that's not
the view from Dallas.
   The operation is not for sale, and top management are adamant in their
commitment to hold onto it. Speculation about the business' future has been
rekindled with the recent announcement by Westinghouse Electric Corp. that
it will sell its Electronics Systems unit.
   TI looks upon the industry's consolidation very differently than many
other large companies who are making bold, strategic moves in that
process.
   ``We don't think bigger is necessarily better,'' says Systems Group
President Dean Clubb. ``Our model is to acquire capabilities that will help
us satisfy the needs of our customers while giving us a competitive edge.
We are working that angle all the time.''
   More often than not, properties that the Group does purchase are apt to
be relatively small, niche acquisitions.
   For example, TI recently acquired PhotoTelesis Corp., a defense
contractor located in San Antonio. TI, which is a major supplier of
electro-optics for military applications, was drawn to the eight-year-old
firm because of its specialty in advanced imagery and data transmission via
military radio. The technology allows images from a battlefield to be
transmitted almost instantly over a satellite to monitors at a command
center.
   With the addition of PhotoTelesis, TI expects to be able to expand its
markets and strengthen its strategy of equipping a digital battlefield,
according to John Wright, manager of the Group's Advanced Land Combat
Systems.
   ``We're not that interested in purchasing things just to get bigger,''
said Clubb, who also is a TI executive vice president.
   The last several years certainly bear that out. During this time, any
major U.S. aerospace/defense company interested in growth by acquisition
has had ample opportunity to implement such a strategy. It is evident that
TI has chosen another route.
   The contribution of aerospace and defense to TI's revenues has dropped
to less than 20% from almost 30% in the early 1990s. Of the corporation's
$10 billion in revenues in 1994, about $1.8 billion came from the Group.
But it has remained solidly profitable, with net margins in the 8-12%
range.
   LOWER U.S. DEFENSE procurement is chiefly responsible for the decline,
although explosive growth in semiconductor sales tends to exaggerate the
dwindling proportion of the Group's overall contribution. TI's strong
financial performance continues to be driven by its semiconductor business,
which accounts for about 75% of its revenue and more than 90% of its
profit.
   From Wall Street, TI's aerospace and defense business is seen as having
insufficient critical mass--or at least approaching such a state--to
compete effectively long-term in an industry that is rapidly
consolidating.
   Some analysts think the operation could be overwhelmed by competitors
who are participating in the consolidation, such as rival electronics and
missile producers Raytheon, Hughes Aircraft and perhaps even Loral. In
time, their expanding technology base and growing economies of scale could
put the TI operation at a cost disadvantage, they argue.
   ``One thing you can't do in this kind of an industry environment is
dither, and TI has been doing little more than standing on the sidelines
and watching as the Group's biggest competitors consolidate,'' according to
one Wall Street veteran of recent large aerospace/defense transactions.
``This is a very capable business, but at this point it probably has more
value to another company.''
   Not as far as TI management is concerned. ``We're a valued part of the
company because of our systems expertise,'' Clubb said.
   He ought to know. As a member of the TI Strategy Leadership Team, he is
among a small group of TI executives who shape the strategic direction of
this $10-billion corporation. Virtually every member of the company's top
management, from the chairman and CEO on down, has been president of the
sector containing TI's aerospace and defense business.
   For years, TI has aggressively promoted a cross fertilization of ideas
and technology between the Group and the company's more commercial-oriented
business sectors. Under contract to the government, TI created the first
forward-looking infrared systems using cryogenically-cooled detectors in
1964, and in 1977 created an uncooled detector that dramatically reduced
the size and power requirements of thermal imaging. The Group remains a
major conduit for the transfer of technology developed for military
applications.
   ``It's important to understand the culture of Texas Instruments,'' James
Schwendinger said. He is head of the aerospace and defense practice of
Deloitte & Touche, a management consulting firm. ``TI is top tier when it
comes to knowledge transfer, and their aerospace and defense business
figures very prominently in that process. They also have kept the business
pretty well aligned in terms of operating performance and cost-control.
   ``So what if [the Group] remains a second-tier player, as long as it is
the supplier of choice in some very specialized technologies?'' he added.
``Wall Street may look at this part of the Texas Instruments puzzle as
lacking critical mass, but I would be very surprised to see TI cut it lose
unless the business becomes a financial drain, and I don't expect that to
happen.''
   The Group has three major objectives: profitable growth, higher quality
and lower production costs by at least 20%--possibly more--depending on how
closely TI and its military customers work together.
   Clubb expects the Group's backlog, which has been declining in recent
years, to begin growing again within the next two years. In addition to
pursuing follow-ups to existing military programs, the company is exploring
other defense markets that it is not now serving.
   Traditionally, international sales have accounted for 12-14% of the
operation's revenues. That is expected to increase substantially. ``There
are many foreign countries standing in line, ready to buy our
precision-guided weapons and sensors,'' Clubb said. ``We're just waiting
for government [licensing].''
   THE GROUP'S STRATEGIC business plan calls for commercializing more of
the operation's defense technology, as well as targeting possible
opportunities in air traffic control. Texas Instruments withdrew from the
FAA market several years ago.
   Clubb leaves no doubt about where the quality initiative fits into the
Group's overall business strategy. ``Winning with quality may sound fairly
easy, but our objective is to produce products at a level that would cause
existing and prospective customers to think twice before awarding a
contract to anyone else.''

U.K. TILT TO EUROPE URGED ON DEFENSE

By:
JOHN D. MORROCCO

(LONDON)
British lawmakers are urging greater government support for preserving the
nation's defense industrial base and closer cooperation with other European
nations as a means to that end.
   A joint Parliamentary report by the Defense and Trade and Industry
committees criticized the government's short-term approach to defense
procurement which emphasizes lowest cost. It called for the Ministry of
Defense to adopt a long-term approach to procurement aimed at retaining key
strategic capabilities within the U.K. and greater use of technology
demonstrator programs.
   The government's policy of straddling the Atlantic in terms of defense
collaboration was also criticized. Lawmakers said they saw no problems with
U.K. companies collaborating with U.S. companies where it was ``mutually
advantageous.'' But they argued that increased collaboration with other
European countries is ``crucial'' to the survival of the British defense
industry.
   Lawmakers believe immense savings can be achieved through rationalizing
Europe's defense industry and eliminating duplication and subsidies.
   Specifically, the report says it is imperative that the U.K. be fully
involved in any future European armaments agency ``from its inception.''
France and Germany are discussing the creation of such an agency that could
initially exclude the U.K. British officials fear this would give French
and German companies an early lead in European cooperative programs that
might result in the marginalization of British defense companies.
   Lawmakers also want to see any such efforts go beyond just coordinating
and managing joint programs. It foresees greater savings through
coordination of military requirements, perhaps by the Western European
Armaments Group, an agency of the Western European Union.
   But the underlying message of the report was that more attention must be
paid to the long-term health of the U.K. defense industry. Awarding
contracts to foreign suppliers based on competitive cost reasons alone
could result in the long-term loss of critical domestic skills.
   Preserving the U.K. defense technology base should be a ``priority,''
the report stated. Such considerations should be ``built into the
procurement process from the initial stages right through to the decision
to order the equipment.'' Specifically, lawmakers called for:
  -- Identification of critical technologies for the industry and
development of strategies to retain a leading edge.
  -- Promotion of dual-use technologies.
  -- Increased funding for technology demonstrator programs.
  -- Clearer guidelines to industry on priorities for procurement
decisions.
  -- A more active government role in promoting ``fair access'' for U.K.
companies to overseas markets and in pressing for the elimination of
subsidies to foreign manufacturers.
  -- Considering export potential at an early stage in determining weapon
specifications.
   Sir Barry Duxbury, director of the Society of British Aerospace
Companies (SBAC), ``wholeheartedly'' welcomed the report. Many of its
recommendations echo those of the SBAC, including the call for increased
funding for technology demonstrator programs to preserve critical skills
and reduce procurement costs. He is awaiting with interest the formal
response of the Ministry of Defense to the report which is not expected
until later this year.
   ANTICIPATING THE REPORT, however, a senior Ministry of Defense official
said a more ``systematic'' approach to the long-term viability of the
defense industrial base would be taken in future procurement decisions.
Days before the report was released, Minister for Defense Procurement James
Arbuthnot said ``cost effective collaboration''within a European defense
industry would be pursued with ``maximum vigor.'' But he also noted that
opportunities existed to build upon the U.K. defense industry's ``strong
foothold'' in the U.S.
   The balance between buying off-the-shelf systems, largely from the U.S.,
versus collaborative or national development is to be reexamined in light
of future strategic requirements. A key indicator of how far the government
is willing to go could come shortly when it decides on whether to upgrade
Royal Air Force F3 Tornado fighters, lease used U.S. F-16s or keep patching
them up until the Eurofighter 2000 arrives next century.
   This is a sensitive issue, given the criticism of two previous decisions
in which the U.K. opted to buy U.S.-developed systems--the Lockheed Martin
C-130J and the McDonnell Douglas AH-64--rather than European-developed
alternatives. Issues of preserving critical skills and jobs were key in
those competitions.
   The Ministry of Defense has been evaluating F-16s as a far less costly
alternative to upgrading its Tornado F3 interceptors. But it is
questionable whether the long-term costs would outweigh the short-term
benefits. The Royal Air Force would have to develop an entirely new
logistics system to support the F-16s.

CONFERENCE OUTLINES SPACE `RAMP-UP' PLAN

By:
WILLIAM B. SCOTT

(COLORADO SPRINGS, COLO.)
A classified conference here last month outlined for U.S. theater command
staffs how joint and service space commands would allocate orbital assets
and provide space support if peacetime operations ``ramp up'' to a combat
footing.
   Some discussions are believed to have addressed scenarios that might
arise during the current Bosnian peacekeeping effort, and how military
space assets could be used by U.S. forces. Military officials would not
comment on particulars of the meeting, however.
   THE THIRD ANNUAL Space Support to the Warfighter Conference, cohosted by
the U.S. Space Command (USSC) and the National Reconnaissance Office's
Operational Support Office, attracted about 250 attendees from 40
organizations. The five-day meeting included senior working-level teams
from the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff; commander-in-chief (CINC) staffs from
Pacific, Central, Atlantic and European theaters; Air Force, Navy and Army
space commands; national intelligence agencies, and the Defense Information
Systems Agency.
   This year's event included briefings, working groups and demonstrations
or displays related to space ``force enhancement'' topics, such as:
  -- Communications.
  -- Navigation (Global Positioning System).
  -- Space control.
  -- Missile warning and the Theater Event System, with emphasis on
theater-class missile threats.
  -- Intelligence.
  -- New modeling and simulation techniques and tools, such as the Theater
Support Operations Cell (TSOC). Carried by Space Support Teams (SSTs)
during deployments to an exercise, the prototype TSOC is a Silicon
Graphics-based computer system that depicts space data in user-friendly
graphics. For example, it displays orbits of satellite constellations in a
simple format, enabling better visualization of coverage at a particular
time (AW&ST Sept. 18, 1995, p. 36).
   ``TSOC focuses on the implications of space systems, not the
technology,'' said Col. Gary W. Dahlen, vice-director of operations for
USSC. ``The most important purpose of this tool is to improve situational
awareness and battlespace knowledge. Operational commanders are fluent in
what ships, tanks and airplanes do. What hasn't been in their bag of tricks
is knowledge about space systems.''
   Demonstrated for conference attendees this year, TSOC uses commercial
and government-developed software already developed for other purposes.
Service versions now being acquired for Air Force, Navy and Army space
support teams will closely parallel the USSC-developed version.
   Last month's conference also devoted an afternoon to the concept of
global broadcast systems (GBS), a potentially revolutionary method for
communicating data to many troops at once via spacecraft. Analogous to
direct broadcast television, GBS would beam information to specific areas
on a battlefield or theater. Conference attendees were to help develop a
consistent set of requirements for direct broadcast data.
   ``We're trying to understand what the field wants,'' Dahlen said prior
to the conference. ``Should data be `pushed' or `pulled'? Should there be a
'smart hub' that sends data on only some channels? Should there be any
feedback mechanism or status messages? How does [GBS] interact with the
concept of the Global Command and Control System?''
   THE ANNUAL SPACE SUPPORT conference was initiated in 1993 to improve
coordination between the USSC and theater CINCs. To support the needs of
CINC staffs unfamiliar with space-based capabilities, USSC and its service
components set up SSTs dedicated to providing expertise to theater or
``warfighting'' commanders and their staffs. Led by an Air Force or Army
colonel or Navy captain having operational experience, these SSTs now
support 10-15 major CINC exercises annually. Team members spend 140-180
days/year in-theater, helping staffs integrate space capabilities into
exercise planning and execution (AW&ST Dec. 12/19, 1994, p. 24). Now
``space officers'' are assigned permanently to CINC staffs to assist with
day-to-day operations.
   End-of-year space support conferences were established ``to tie up the
loose ends and bring everybody up to date,'' on technologies, issues and
space command activities, Dahlen said. Because attendees consistently have
been ``operators'' from CINC staffs, such as directors of intelligence,
operations and communications, the meetings typically concentrate on
capabilities available now or in the near future.
   ``THE FIRST YEAR we had about 10 people from the unified commands and
their components. The second year we had 10-19, and this year [requests
ranged from] 13 for some commands and up to 25 for others. These forums
seem to be attracting the right people,'' said Chris H. Lugenbill, a member
of the OAO Corp./PRC Inc. contract support team for USSC. About twice as
many people request attendance as can be accommodated at each conference.
   The annual events are hands-on, practical sessions aimed at providing
applicable information that attendees can take back to their units and
apply immediately. Dialogue also has helped the space community better
focus its support efforts.
   ``Our first priority is to understand the field guy's job, and the
second is to broker space solutions to problems the field commanders might
have,'' Dahlen said. ``Many people out in the field thought there was a
mystique about space systems--'behind the green door' [highly classified]
or too technical. We now give them hands-on [experience] such as operating
a GPS 'Slugger,' manipulating multispectral data and using communication
devices.''

BOEING PLANS EELV TESTING

By:
JOSEPH C. ANSELMO

(WASHINGTON)
Boeing is planning an air drop and water retrieval of a propulsion system
containing a Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) to demonstrate the viability
of using recoverable components for a new launch vehicle family.
   The air drop will be part of a series of tests the company plans to
perform this summer as part of a $30-million contract it won last August to
validate its concept for the Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle
(EELV) program.
   Similar EELV contracts were won by Alliant Techsystems, Lockheed Martin
and McDonnell Douglas, but only two competitors are slated to survive when
the Air Force awards pre-engineering, manufacturing and development
contracts in December.
   Boeing officials believe their plan to use a recoverable propulsion
module powered by a Block 2 SSME offers the best hope of meeting the EELV
program goal of lowering launch costs by 25-50%. The company recently
signed an agreement with NASA to utilize a spare SSME and engine test
facilities at the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.
   Plans call for the SSME to be integrated with a 17-ft.-dia. prototype
propulsion module that is being built for Boeing by Textron. Testing would
begin this summer with several simulated drops from a test stand crane into
a canal at Stennis to verify integration and instrumentation data. That
would be followed by an airplane drop of the propulsion module, possibly
over the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``Basically, we'll be demonstrating the conclusion of the operational
sequence as the propulsion module is decelerated and returned by water
entry,'' said Tim White, Boeing's EELV program manager.
   The propulsion system would then be recovered and the SSME test-fired to
demonstrate its reusability, he said.
   The idea of a recoverable propulsion module is not new to Boeing. The
company conducted 550 tests over 14 years as part of its proposals for the
ill-fated Advanced Launch System and National Launch System programs. But
this summer's tests will mark the first time that live engine hardware has
been used.
   NASA has also offered the use of Stennis' three active test stands to
Boeing's EELV competitors, but only Boeing has signed an agreement to date,
according to Patrick Scheuermann, EELV project manager at the space center.
He said Stennis is eager to offer its facilities for use by industry and
the military.

AMERICAN TECHNOLOGIES INC.

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

AMERICAN TECHNOLOGIES INC. of Fond du Lac, Wis., is marketing mobile
communications services to transportation companies via a system it claims
is faster and cheaper than store-and-forward satellite systems. ATI's
Logitrak system uses Comstar and Spacenet satellites and the Internet to
deliver messages and position data. A truck driver, for example, could send
a message to a dispatcher within 3 sec., according to company president
Larry Bestor. Using the system requires a data terminal and satellite
receiver that currently sells for about $2,500, but unlimited service is
offered at a flat rate of $50 per month.

A MONTAGE OF 12 IMAGES

By:
EDITED BY JAMES R. ASKER

A MONTAGE OF 12 IMAGES from the Soft X-ray Telescope on Japan's Yohkoh
satellite (below) has been created to show the Sun's corona from a peak and
through the waning phase of one 11-year activity cycle. Lockheed Martin
Palo Alto Research Laboratories built the telescope in collaboration with
Japanese scientists. Direct observation of the corona is difficult because
it is much fainter than the star's surface. However, at 2 million K, the
corona is hot enough to emit X-rays, while the 6,000 K surface does not.
But because the X-rays are absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, a spaceborne
instrument was required. The image on the left was taken Nov. 12, 1991,
during the peak of coronal activity, while the picture on the far right was
made July 27, 1995, shortly before solar minimum.

MARKET FOCUS

By:
ANTHONY L. VELOCCI, JR./NEW YORK

   TRW Inc. is preparing to take action to increase shareholder value
substantially. Among other things, the company is considering repurchasing
a block of its own stock as well as acquisitions.
   Whatever TRW does, some Wall Street analysts are hoping it includes the
sale of the information systems and services unit. The business accounts
for 6% of total sales. While the unit seems to be holding its own, the
analysts believe it could do even better if spun off to the right buyer.
Some market professionals believe such a move would raise TRW's trading
multiple.
   ``The perception is that TRW cares very little about shareholder
value,'' said Jack Blackstock, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette. ``Depending on how aggressively the company addresses this issue,
it's not hard to envision the stock at $100-115 a share.'' While Blackstock
has set a 12-month target price of $90-100, he described the company as a
``table-pounding buy.'' The stock closed at 771/4 last Wednesday.
   Definitely not on the list of options is the sale of TRW's space and
defense business, according to Chairman and CEO Joseph T. Gorman. After
sagging in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it is showing net growth. Sales
in 1995 exceeded $3 billion. Not since 1987 has space and defense made such
a relatively large contribution to TRW's coffers. In the first nine months
of 1995, the operation logged $3.6 billion in new contracts. Firm backlog
stands at a record $4.6 billion.
   ``I was among the analysts who sat around in disbelief back in 1992 when
Gorman told us the space and defense business would show net growth
starting in the second half of the 1990s, and it's turning out that he was
right,'' Blackstock said. ``What that tells me is that he's a lot better
than people give him credit for.''
   As expected, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. recently
won their court battle over the 1991 cancellation of the U.S. Navy's A-12
attack aircraft. A federal judge ruled the program was killed for
convenience, not default as the government contended. Now, one outstanding
issue is how much of the $2 billion-plus in claims the contractors will
collect. The other issue is whether the government will appeal.
   Some aerospace analysts believe the anticipated win already is reflected
in the companies' stock prices. ``This did not come as a surprise, although
it was a big step toward clearing the air,'' Merrill Lynch analyst Byron
Callan said. ``Now the question is not whether they'll get something but
when and how much.'' What has not been factored into the stock prices is
how a settlement could enhance earnings power, Callan added.
   ``I would be surprised if there is no attempt to seek damages over and
above the claims already pending,'' JSA Research analyst Paul Nisbet noted.
``If that happens, there could be two paydays.'' Executives of both
companies have cited possible damage to their concerns' reputations from
government accusations.
   Callan and Nisbet think the stock prices could increase slightly on the
reality of the settlement, depending on size and timing. If the companies
do collect, McDonnell Douglas is expected to use the windfall to pay down
debt and add to its war chest for acquisitions. General Dynamics, which is
virtually debt-free and has about $1 billion in cash, is expected to use
all of the money for acquisitions.

APACHE LONGBOW TO USE VAPOR CYCLE COOLING

By:
BRUCE D. NORDWALL

(WASHINGTON)
A cooling system developed by Fairchild Controls using refrigerant and an
unusual compressor design is gaining applications to cool military avionics
that require high output and low weight.
   The vapor cycle system has an efficiency 10-20% greater than an air
cycle system, according to Drew Bogus, director for business development at
Fairchild Controls. The electrically powered design avoids the degradations
in aircraft performance sometimes caused by large bleed air extraction to
power the alternative--a conventional air-cycle environmental control
system. Still, the system puts an electrical load on the engine drawing 36
Kva. for maximum cooling in the latest application.
   That utilization uses two independent systems to cool the Apache Longbow
mission avionics. One cools the forward avionics bay and gunner, and the
other cools the aft avionics and pilot. First flight for the Apache Longbow
installation was late September, about 15 months after contract award.
Production deliveries could begin in October, Bogus said.
   The positive displacement compressor has an unusual helical-rotor
design. Twin counter-rotating screws give the heli-rotor higher compression
efficiency, in a small housing, than other compressor designs, according to
the company. The compressors are currently produced in two sizes, a 54-mm.
diameter and a 30-mm. The smaller of the rolling piston compressors has
cooling capacities between 2 and 4.5 kW., depending on the applications.
   The small rotors turn at about 11,000 rpm., a much lower speed than air
cycle machines, because the thermodynamic properties of their refrigerant
require less mass through the compressor to get the same cooling capacity.
The closed-loop vapor cycle system uses HFC-134a, the environmentally
friendly refrigerant now standard for most automotive air conditioners.
Company officials say the lower speed makes the system inherently more
reliable with a current MTBF (mean time between failure) of 1,500 hr. and a
goal of 2,000 hr. Vapor cycle systems are also quieter, producing about 50%
less noise, according to Bogus. They can be designed to run at multiple
speeds, high for rapid cooling, low for standard use.
   The increasing density of military avionics is creating the need for
cooling solutions such as this vapor cycle system and liquid flow-through
cooling in the U.S. Air Force's new F-22 and the Army's AH-66 Comanche
helicopter. But the technology is far from new. Fairchild Controls' vapor
cycle systems have been used for years in the Pave tack airborne targeting
and laser designation system for F-111s and for cooling VIP helicopters.

MITSUBISHI INTRODUCES AIRBORNE IR IMAGER

(WASHINGTON)
Mitsubishi's new IR-G600 high-resolution thermal imager is designed for
aircraft/unmanned aerial vehicles. The 15-lb. unit has a built-in Stirling
cycle cooler, measures 7 X 8 X 8 in., has a mean time between failure
(MTBF) of over 8,000 hr., and sells for about $90,000. The 512 X 512
element platinum silicide focal plane array, sensitive to changes of 0.08C,
operates in the 1.2-5.9 micron band.

MAKE ECONOMICS THE BASIS OF AVIATION PACTS

The best way for the U.S. to secure the strongest possible international
aviation agreements is for our negotiators to make decisions based on
economic analysis with the goal of maximizing benefits for the U.S.
economy. International aviation decisions should turn on what is best for
our country, not which carriers can generate the most political support. In
1995, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena did an excellent job in this
regard. U.S. passenger and cargo carriers are capitalizing on a plethora of
new international opportunities, while the increased competition is
bringing consumers lower air fares, reduced shipping costs and greater
choices. . . .
   Looking ahead to 1996 . . . we face a number of challenges, most notably
aviation policy with Japan and the U.K. Also, we have a golden opportunity
to obtain an ``open skies'' agreement with Germany that would be a catalyst
for further liberation of European air service opportunities. . . .
   The major impediment to liberalizing aviation relations with Japan is
the high operating cost of Japanese carriers, due in large part to Japan's
tightly regulated airline industry. Until Japan permits its carriers to
become more competitive, there will be enormous pressure within the country
to continue to protect its air service market.
   Japan, along with other Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation members
including the U.S., recently committed to work toward free and open trade
between all member nations. The so-called Bogor Declaration has the
potential to have a major impact on U.S./Japan aviation relations.
   ONE THING, HOWEVER, IS CERTAIN: The continued refusal of Japan to abide
by the terms of U.S./Japan bilateral concerning beyond rights guaranteed to
several of our carriers undoubtedly will complicate aviation relations
between our two countries. Currently, Japan is refusing to honor United
Airlines' right to provide service between Osaka and Seoul. FedEx is being
wrongfully denied the right to provide service between Japan and China.
Beyond rights from Japan are absolutely essential if U.S. carriers are to
fully participate in the booming Asia-Pacific market. . . .
   Of all our international aviation agreements, the most restrictive and
therefore our most anti-consumer bilateral is the so-called Bermuda 2 pact.
Approximately 58% of the passenger traffic between the U.S. and U.K. is
carried on British airlines. In 1984-85, British carriers improved their
market share vis-a-vis U.S. airlines by 21%. During the same period, a
majority of carriers from other European Community countries lost market
share. These statistics are particularly remarkable when one considers that
operating costs of European carriers are higher than those of U.S.
airlines...
   THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT IS ENTHUSIASTIC about promptly securing an open
skies agreement with the U.S. An open skies agreement with Germany
immediately would produce new air service opportunities for our carriers
between the U.S. and Germany. Equally important, German airports would
provide well-situated gateways for our carriers to serve points beyond
Germany such as the Middle East and the booming Asia-Pacific market.
   An open skies agreement with Germany--in combination with liberalized
air service agreements we secured with the Netherlands in 1992 and nine
other European countries earlier this year--would mean nearly half of all
passengers traveling between the U.S. and Europe would be flying to or from
European countries with open skies regimes. The recent European Commission
report on E.C./U.S. aviation relations astutely concluded that other
European countries that resist liberalization ``will either have to follow
the open skies policy, or risk being left behind in the competition and in
market share.''
   BETWEEN 1992 AND 1994, total passenger traffic between the U.S. and the
Netherlands grew an astounding 56%. During the same period, total passenger
traffic between the U.S. and U.K. grew just 7.5%. What does this
illustrate? It demonstrates that Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is drawing
passenger traffic originating in the U.S. away from U.K. airports,
particularly London Heathrow.
   The international aviation challenges we face in 1996 make it imperative
that our negotiators continue to make decisions based on economic analysis
with the goal of maximizing benefits for the U.S. economy. This was a
successful formula in our 1995 international aviation negotiations. In
1996, it is critical we build on the lesson we learned during the past
year.

About the Author(s):

Larry Pressler (R.-S.D.) chairs the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce,
Science and Transportation. In a speech on the Senate floor just before the
holidays, he said 1996 will be a critical year for the U.S. in
international aviation negotiations. And, he outlined his vision of
strategies the nation should pursue. Excerpts from his speech follow:

EVACUATE! EVACUATE! EVACUATE!
A few lessons, and one or two laughs from an actual evacuation.

By:
Dan Manningham

On October 9, 1969, United Airlines Flight 74 operated as a DC-8 from Las
Vegas to New York. Fred Edwards was the captain, Tom Greene was second
officer (Flight Engineer) and I was in the copilot seat. It was a typical
``Vegas'' trip, being nearly full with a crowd of New Yorkers on their way
home from the tables.
   In the front lounge, four passengers were playing poker. These were four
rough-looking guys. Tough, mean, angry. Definitely not the types you would
expect to see at an arts festival or the garden club.
   One of those men would make an excellent character for a movie. He could
be in the orthopedic business, a bone specialist. He could be named
``Frank'' or something. At least that's how he looked to me.
   This Frank appeared to have a 20-inch neck, 30-inch sleeve, 40-inch
waist, was about 50 years old, 60 pounds overweight, 70 inches tall with an
IQ of 80. He had hands like shovels and a face like raw meat. And he looked
mean. This was not a guy who worried about whales or human suffering in a
drought-stricken country.
   The IQ thing was just appearance, though. Frank was no dummy. As the
game progressed, Frank stuffed his considerable winnings into his
see-through shirt so that his ample torso was eventually obscured by layers
of tens and twenties. By the time we began the Canarsie VOR approach to
Runway 13L at JFK, Frank was finishing a solid payday, and his three
companions were looking unhappy.
   In the cockpit, the flight was completely normal. The evening in New
York was clear, cool and calm in the nicest sense of a fall twilight. Fred
flew the Canarsie approach with his usual skill, and we rolled out right on
final and with the VASI lights perfectly red over white. The touchdown was
sweet, and we made the early turnoff with the help of considerable engine
reverse. Fred was an artist of flight.
   As we cleared the runway, our day began in earnest with the simultaneous
arrival of two separate communications. First, the tower controller called
to say, ``United 74, it appears that your right wing is on fire.'' At the
same instant, the cabin call chime rang urgently, and Tom grabbed the phone
to hear the aft flight attendant say that the entire right wing was in
flames. Without warning, we were on fire in a big way, and the conclusion
to a routine flight suddenly became the beginning of a serious challenge.
The next five minutes contained so many separate activities that 26 years
later, my memory is expanded as if it contained several hours.
   My job was to proceed (that was the word in the emergency
procedure-''proceed'') to the ground and direct the evacuation from there.
It was my favorite emergency assignment: Leave the burning airplane for
others to deal with, and help the passengers as they came off (as in, ``You
stay here, and I'll go for help.'')
   Fred and I shut down all four engines, and the airplane was suddenly
quiet and dark. The emergency lights worked off a dedicated battery, and
that provided minimal illumination. My ``proceeding'' took me over the
pedestal and directly across Tom's lap. (I think he still has a heel print
on his right thigh.)
   When I opened the cockpit door, the forward flight attendant-a large
woman-was just latching open the big entry door. Her size had combined with
an adrenaline rush to create enough raw energy to slam that heavy door open
like the screen door on Grandpa's cabin. The slide was inflating nicely,
too.
   For some reason, the PA wasn't functioning, so I exercised my
considerable talents at sheer oral volume to announce to the passengers
that leaving the airplane was a wise choice at this particular time of
their lives. I just shouted that message down the long, dark cabin and was
amazed to watch passengers suddenly spring to their feet in search of an
exit. I later learned that the flight attendants at the rear door heard
every word clearly, a fact that did not surprise my children.
   Frank did not need any such instruction. He had seen the flames through
his window and pushed his way onto the slide after scooping up all of the
money on the table and stuffing it into his already bulging shirt. He hit
the ground running and was never seen again. Not in the assembly. Not on
the buses to the terminal. And not at baggage claim. Frank had his own
agenda.
   I followed Frank to the ground, and instructed the next two passengers
to assist others as they came off the slide before I moved to the next
evacuation station. New Yorkers were leaving the airplane like commuters at
their home station. From the over-wing exit, passengers were sliding off
the flap, and I asked one of the men to instruct the evacuees to assemble
on the grass well clear of the airplane. I still hadn't seen the right wing
where the fire was, but I was on my way. Approximately 30 seconds had
elapsed from the initial transmission from the tower.
   As I rounded the tail, the airplane appeared completely normal in every
respect, with no evidence of fire or any other distress. This was both
pleasing and puzzling, but the evacuation was in progress and needed to be
concluded as safely as possible.
   When I reached the right-flap area, a large, ungainly woman was just
scooting toward the drop-off point and sobbing in terror at the prospect of
sliding those 10 feet or so to the ground. I made a quick judgment call to
send her back through the airplane because I could see that she would
almost certainly suffer severe harm in the drop. By this time her . . .
well, her ah . . . her umm . . . posterior was somewhat critically balanced
at the flap hinge so that she had great difficulty performing a maneuver
that could best be described as cheek reversal. Still, with the help of
loud encouragement and a male passenger on the wing, she was able to
wriggle her hindquarters back up onto the wing far enough to stand up and
walk back to the over-wing exit. From there, she could re-enter the
airplane and then leave again in a relatively safe and dignified manner by
way of an entrance door slide.
   By this time, no more people were coming out, so I returned to the left
side where the passengers were assembling, sort of. Getting 120 passengers
to stand still in one area following a serious emotional trauma was like
herding turtles. Individuals and groups just kept wandering off and had to
be repeatedly asked to stay put for a head count.
   Suddenly, that big empty airplane seemed very dark and quiet. A light
breeze flowed across JFK, and a sweet melancholy pervaded the scene of 120
people who were safely evacuated but now were coping with very real and
very recent fear. Passengers stood around in small groups and talked
quietly as though something solemn was happening. And in a way, it was.
   At that moment, a young man approached me to say that his ``baby was
still on the airplane.'' That started the adrenaline all over again, and I
scrambled up the aft slide into the dark cabin of the abandoned airliner, a
feat that proved to be far more difficult than I anticipated due to the
angle and slickness of the slide. I noticed Fred right behind me, and
together we searched the cabin but found nothing. No passengers, no baby
and only the detritus of 120 human beings on their way home from a
completely frivolous journey: decks of cards, newspapers and empty cups. We
searched again, quickly, and then slid to the ground for the second time to
find the father with his baby in his arms. There never was an explanation.
Fathers are entitled to that.
   Now I noticed that the area was filling with fire vehicles, police
cruisers and airport officials. Shortly thereafter, buses arrived to take
the passengers to the terminal where they would eventually retrieve their
luggage. Somehow, we got our bags from the airplane and made our way to the
company office spaces in the United hangar. It was a lousy way to end a
trip, and it was not over.
   Fred knew that the NTSB-and others-would want a complete statement of
the event. He also knew that it was difficult to provide a coherent and
consistent statement from three individuals. Therefore, we grabbed another
pilot in operations and adjourned to a diner to review the experience.
Fred, Tom and I sorted through the details of a 60-second experience for
nearly three hours until we were satisfied that the details were correct
and in proper sequence.
   I went home and typed three copies on my 20-year-old mechanical Royal so
that we could meet with various investigative bodies in the morning and
sound rational as a crew in the process. This was not an exercise in
obfuscation but, rather, an attempt to organize our collective memories for
accuracy.
   We all agreed that the evacuation was a valuable experience, gained with
minimal harm to people or property. We were all surprised by the great
value of United's disciplined and repeated training in evacuations.
According to the control tower's reckoning, the airplane was completely
emptied in less than 60 seconds. If the fire had propagated, that might
have been all the time we would have had.
   We all chuckled at ``Frank'' and his behavior, but that was a lesson in
human independence and fickleness.
   We noticed that nothing ever works as planned; in this case, the PA
failed when we needed it most. Also, the aft, left slide originally
deployed straight down, which would have prevented its use. But,
fortunately, some passengers were able to shake it into position. Still,
that delayed the evacuation for several seconds.
   I personally reviewed my decision to send two or three people back into
the airplane from the right wing, and concluded that it did probably save a
serious injury-but at some risk to those passengers if the fire had
rekindled. Still, it's always hard to argue with success. It could have
gone wrong, but it didn't.
   We noticed in retrospect that the lack of daylight complicated the
entire procedure. Darkness in the cabin and on the ground made everything
more difficult. Pocket flashlights were a tremendous help.
   I was impressed by the readiness of passengers to respond to firm, loud
orders to evacuate. Even those who had watched the fire through the windows
didn't move toward the exits until expressly ordered to do so by a
crewmember.
   We all found the process of developing a coherent statement together to
be extremely beneficial. The Safety Board received that statement the way
in which it was intended, and no one questioned our motives for preparing
it.
   The morning meetings went well. No threat of legal or punitive action
was raised. In fact, we were given a compliment or two. After meeting with
the officials, I walked out to look over the airplane.
   It was sunny that morning-sunny and warm. The DC-8 stood alone on the
hangar ramp; deserted. It looked more dignified with its doors closed and
the slides removed. It looked like the proud airplane it was, even as it
looked isolated and abandoned. It was a reminder that character is within
the individual, not the group.
   I examined the aircraft carefully, but there was no evidence of a fire.
No soot, or charring or damage. The lighting that morning was excellent,
and any evidence of fire should have been clearly visible, but there was
none. I would find out later that no one ever did find evidence of a fire.
The great fire that had alarmed the tower controllers from more than a mile
away, that the flight attendants saw through the windows and that
frightened Frank was a mystery. Some things just are.

ATC ON THE BLINK
ATC computers seem to be dropping like flies. What's wrong with the system,
and what will you encounter if you get caught in an outage?

By:
Perry Bradley

   In May 1993, when the Clinton administration began its push for
corporatizing the ATC system, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and
Vice President Al Gore held a press conference at Washington National
Airport to demonstrate just how dire was the need for change. Pena and Gore
held up vacuum tubes and displayed archaic computer terminals to prove the
point that the FAA desperately needed reform.
   As it turns out, the publicity stunt with the vacuum tube was prophetic.
Although several plans for FAA reform have come and gone in the intervening
years, aging ATC equipment has begun to exact its toll on the system's
users, as predicted.
   Even though overall system availability is at 99.4 percent-an all-time
high-reports of equipment outages seem to be coming ever more frequently,
especially at Air Route Traffic Control Centers. Witness these recent
examples:
   -- On August 9, 1995, a power out-age at Oakland Center caused 333
delays and one TCAS resolution alert. Full service was restored after 78
minutes.
   -- On September 7, 1995, a power failure at Kansas City Center caused a
service interruption lasting six hours, 23 minutes, resulting in 13
delays.
   -- On October 17, 1995, a power failure at Fort Worth Center resulted
in 263 delayed flights. The equipment failure lasted 14 hours, 35 minutes;
air traffic services were disrupted for 12 minutes.
   -- On September 11, 1995, a computer failure at Chicago Center resulted
in 35 delays and one ``operational error.'' Service was fully restored in
two hours, eight minutes. On November 1, two computer failures at Chicago
Center resulted in 313 delays.
   -- On November 16, 1995, New York Center twice went to back-up systems
for a total of 48 minutes due to a computer error. Approximately 30
aircraft were delayed.

AN AGING SYSTEM
   Glitches like these were never supposed to happen. The Advanced
Automation System (AAS), conceived in the mid 1980s, was to have completely
modernized and restructured the nation's ATC system. AAS' failure is well
documented. Almost from the outset, program milestones began slipping, and
costs skyrocketed. Several program reviews followed, ultimately resulting
in a radical restructuring of the automation plans.
   Stan Rivers, the FAA's deputy director for airway facilities, says
today's problems have their roots in delays in the modernization program.
``You just can't keep stuff around for 30 or 40 years without running into
sustainability problems,'' he notes, explaining that wiring becomes
brittle, components wear out, and it gets tougher to find people who know
how to keep the old systems running. ``That's just age, and there's almost
nothing you can do about it.''
   Federal officials prefer the term ``service interruption'' to outage.
But semantics aside, no one disagrees that the ATC system is showing its
age. And with even temporary fixes more than a year away, experts also
agree that the string of interruptions will continue for the foreseeable
future.
   While news reports have tended to lump all the failures together, in
fact, the interruptions have occurred for a variety of reasons-some
related, some downright mundane. For instance, New York Center twice went
to its back-up systems on November 16, 1995, prompting some limited delays.
While a software problem initially was suspected, it turned out a stuck key
at a controller's workstation sent 14,000 commands to one of the center's
computers, overwhelming it and prompting it to shut down, according to John
Walker, who manages New York Center.
   Still, there are two common threads linking a number of the outages over
the past year: First, the most serious upsets have been complete power
failures that ironically stemmed from an initiative to upgrade the power
grid at the 20 center facilities. Oakland, California, New York and Chicago
Center all had complete failures during the switch to the new ARTCC
Critical and Essential Power System, or ACEPS.
   ``At some point, you have to switch over from the old to the new, and
that's a sensitive transfer,'' says Rivers. The FAA has since revised some
of its procedures for working on the power grid to minimize the chance of a
problem.
   The other frequently implicated component is a 1960s-vintage IBM
mainframe computer that drives controller displays in the five busiest
centers. In the mid 1970s, 15 of the 20 center facilities made the
transition to a Raytheon Computer Display Channel. However, the five
centers with the highest volume-Chicago, Cleveland, Fort Worth, New York
and Washington, D.C.-retained the older IBM 9020Es that are failing with
increasing regularity. In August 1995, the FAA decided to invest $65
million to replace the 9020Es, beginning in 1997.

REDUNDANT SYSTEMS
   Despite all the hype, chances are if a center has a failure, you will
actually feel very little impact-if you know about it at all, according to
controllers and FAA officials. The centers are built with at least two
layers of redundant systems backing up the primary operating system. (See
accompanying graphic.)
   Of the more than 82-million air traffic operations annually, fewer than
250,000 experience delays, according to the FAA. Some 98 percent of delays
are weather related, leaving just two percent of all delays attrib-utable
to equipment failures. Still, it does happen.
   Simply stated, an air route traffic control center comprises three basic
computing components: the host computer, the Display Channel Complex (DCC)
and the Direct Access Radar Channel (DARC). The systems are intertwined in
such a way that if one of them fails, the others can make up for its
absence, albeit with reduced capabilities.
   The host computers, IBM 3038 mainframes installed in the mid 1980s, are
the nerve center of the operation. They handle all flight-data processing
including flight plans, automated hand-offs, and automatic flight-progress
strip generation.
   From the host computer, data are fed to the DCC. The DCC processes radar
information and drives the controller's display. Ironically, the five
busiest centers have the oldest DCCs. ``They're a little older than
anything else we've got,'' says the FAA's Rivers.
   The final component in the triad is the DARC. The DARC is a back-up
system that sends comparatively raw radar data directly to controller
workstations. If the DCC fails, the system reverts to DARC/Host operations.
If the DCC and the host computer both fail, the system goes to DARC-only
operations, the most degraded condition short of an all-out shutdown.

WHEN THE SYSTEM BLINKS
   Denis Burke has had more than his fair share of experience with computer
outages and back-up systems over the last year or so. As air traffic
manager at Chicago Center, Burke has seen seven outages since September
1994, and says he expects more. ``Technicians are watching over [the 9020E]
very carefully,'' Burke comments. ``It's been gone over with a fine-toothed
comb. We expect that though we will probably experience some more outages,
they won't be significant.''
   When a system does fail, the first thing the center will do is
``sterilize'' its airspace, according to Burke. In September 1994, Chicago
experienced its worst outage (to date) when power to the facility was
interrupted for an instant during maintenance. After the outage, all of the
computers had to spool back up, a process Burke likens to rebooting your
home computer. In that instance, it took just 12 minutes to sterilize the
center's 133,000-square-mile chunk of airspace.
   In the event of an outage, the center contacts FAA flow control, which
institutes a ground hold on any inbound aircraft not yet airborne. Traffic
already en route, but not yet in the affected center's airspace, will be
rerouted around the center. Aircraft already in the center's airspace might
be asked to hold while controllers verify that all the aircraft they are
handling are up on the back-up system. Alternatively, some aircraft in the
area may be handed off to other centers or to approach controllers.
   Controllers often let pilots know when they are experiencing equipment
trouble, but notification is not required. Some of the hallmarks of a
problem, says Burke, are ground delays on days when weather obviously isn't
an issue, or when you suddenly hear new transponder codes being given to
aircraft in your area. Because their workload goes up during an outage,
controllers often will ask pilots not to read back instructions unless so
advised.
   Power outages also can take down radios. In the event of a com failure,
you are expected to adhere to your last clearance and to attempt to
reestablish communications on your last assigned frequency. If that doesn't
work, try calling the nearest flight service station, or any other ATC
facility in your area-an approach control or control tower, for instance.
Chances are, by the time you establish contact, word of the failure will be
out, and plans will be set in motion to handle the aircraft involved.
   Burke and other facility mangers who have experienced outages say pilots
have conducted themselves in outstanding fashion. Indeed, the FAA confirms
just two operational errors in 1995 during outages. Obviously, TCAS is a
valuable tool for pilots and provides an additional safety net during an
outage.

FAILURE MODES
   Noting the system's inherent redundancy, Burke says the transition to
the DARC/Host-the primary back-up-can be virtually transparent. ``Truly the
only catastrophe that's involved is the lack of ability to move the same
volume of traffic,'' he explains.
   In DARC/Host mode, controllers begin to lose some of their ``enhanced''
capabilities. No longer do they get automatic conflict alerts, minimum safe
altitude warnings, or the ability to put a five-mile distance reference
indicator circle around slow-moving traffic to ease vectoring other
aircraft.
   However, most functions of the primary system are replicated. ``The
information you need to separate airplanes is all there: location, speed,
altitude, direction of flight, and flight plan,'' says Burke.
``Everything's there, but some of the enhancements that have been added
over the years are no longer there, and that's always a concern, but it's
not a safety issue.''
The host computer continues to operate in DARC/Host mode, and that means
controllers still have access to flight-plan information, can automatically
hand-off traffic to other ATC facilities, and get automatic preparation of
paper flight-progress strips that are used to back-up radar information.
   If the primary system fails, controllers may have a little additional
work to ensure that the transition to the back-up is successful. But once
the changeover is verified, operations should be almost business as usual.
   A worse event is the failure of both the DCC and the host computer.
Although rare, such dual failures have occurred, and their impact can be
dramatic. In essence, when the system reverts to DARC only, controllers
have to do their work either manually or verbally, which reduces the
ability to handle traffic by as much as 70 percent.
   For instance, while radar screens still track aircraft, all of the
flight-data-processing functions go off-line when the host computer shuts
down. That means controllers have to manually create and update data strips
and hand-off all traffic verbally, which requires land-line contact with
other controllers.

TO THE RESCUE?
   The recent spate of outages and the attention they've gotten in the
press have prompted the FAA to decide to spend $65 million to upgrade the
troublesome 9020Es at the five centers that still have them. Chicago is
slated to get the first upgrade in January 1997, with the others to follow
at the rate of one per month through May 1997. DCC Rehost, as the project
is called, initially was conceived as an ``insurance'' program to offset
old computers reaching a critical state before broader center upgrades
begin in 1998.
   On August 1, 1995, DOT Secretary Pena cashed in the insurance policy and
announced that the Rehost program would proceed. Essentially, the Rehost
program uses new hardware to operate the software currently running on the
9020E. If all goes according to schedule, the Rehost will serve as a
Band-Aid until the $1.1-billion Display System Replacement (DSR) program
begins to replace center hardware and software in 1998. In 2001, the FAA
plans to upgrade DARC to make it a more robust and automated back-up; and
in 2002, ARTCC host computers will be replaced to increase capacity.
   Other FAA initiatives triggered by the rash of service interruptions
include reviewing and updating contingency plans at all centers, retraining
controllers on making the transition to back-up systems, training more
technicians to work on the old equipment, and adding more controllers at
Chicago Center.
   Controllers themselves look on promised computer fixes with a jaundiced
eye. ``In the corporate world, most King Airs fly with two pilots, even
though they can be operated by one,'' observes Mark Scholl, who heads the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) union shop at Chicago
Center. ``The FAA doesn't staff a facility like you'd staff an airplane.
We're staffed for the best sunny day in July, not an emergency.''
   Citing years of delays in the former advanced automation system,
controllers at Chicago Center say they doubt the Rehost program or the DSR
will happen as scheduled. ``[Adding staff] is a concrete thing that will
help,'' according to Bryan Zilonis, another NATCA representative in
Chicago. ``Computers are just another promise, and we've heard that
before.''
   Whether it's new computers, new people, or a combination of both that
provides the fix, everyone involved with the ATC system agrees that
additional service interruptions are likely-at least for the next year. The
transition to back-ups often is seamless, but prudence dictates that
flightcrews, like controllers, take a little extra time to review their
contingency plans.
   ``You just have to remind yourself that it's a possibility,'' Burke
advises pilots. ``You need to sit up, listen up and be prepared.''

CHICAGO'S FBOS
A ring of airports with first-class services keeps business aviation in and
around Chicagoland on the move.

By:
Robert B. Parke

   Business is thriving for most of the dedicated business-aviation FBOs in
the Chicago area.
   A score or more of fine airports that offer services to corporate
aircraft of every sort dot the Chicago area, but a half dozen in the
immediate vicinity of Chicago's business centers get the bulk of the
business. Each of these closer airfields has 5,000-plus-foot runways and
suitable instrument approaches, plus other accommodations for larger
corporate aircraft. And perhaps surprisingly, for many crews headed for
Chicago, there is no better destination than that mother of all humongous
airports, O'Hare International (KORD).

THAT MAMMOTH O'HARE
   In spite of O'Hare's consistently leading the list of the world's
airports with the largest number of movements per year and having
occasional, vastly inconvenient ATC failures, many pilots appreciate its
controllers for their precise communications and handling. For the most
part, flightcrews appreciate their grasp of corporate aircraft needs.
   ``Best in the world,'' said one corporate pilot munching popcorn fresh
from the O'Hare Signature Flight Support popcorn machine while other
aircrew members nodded approval. ``They know that we need to stay aloft,
and they cooperate. All you have to do is your standard homework and stay
with them, and you're in and out fast. We have fewer delays here than we do
at other smaller airports. And when feasible, they will land us close to
the general-aviation area.''
   Runways 9R (10,141 feet) and 4R (8,071 feet) feed directly into the
corporate-aviation parking area in the southeast corner of the vast complex
where Signature Flight Support provides services.
   Several flightcrew members gave particular credit for their satisfaction
with ORD to the squeaky clean, spacious Signature facilities. They touted
the usual crew amenities such as lounge rooms and rest areas, in addition
to the Signature specialties of loaner cars and fresh popcorn.
   Managed by Michael Brasier, the O'Hare FBO provides a large parking ramp
with plenty of overflow room nearby. On-site deicing is available. Access
from parking to the Signature reception area is through a tightly guarded
security gate. This can be cleared by a van driven by a Signature
representative, or a limousine can pick up or deliver passengers if
accompanied by a Signature representative.
   Also, Signature's fleet of vans picks up and delivers corporate-aircraft
passengers connecting with commercial flights.
   The Signature reception desk handles orders and services, and explains
the Signature Prime Rate II formula for fuel pricing.
   A helipad is located near the general-aviation area and is used for
charter flights to outlying business centers and by several corporations
that operate frequent shuttle services from O'Hare to business headquarters
on the fringes of Chicago.
   Landing fees at O'Hare for FAR Part 91 operations are set at $2.59 per
thousand pounds maximum landing weight, and slightly lower for Part 135
operators.

ON TO THE MIDWAY
   Midway Airport (KMDW) offers miles of runways, four precision
approaches, two full-service FBOs and 40 minutes driving time to downtown
Chicago. Located 15 miles southeast of O'Hare, Midway is still the airport
of choice for many corporate operators.
   KMDW features eight runways, each over 5,000 feet, three with ILS
approaches and one runway-22L-with an MLS, assuring landings under most
adverse weather conditions.
   Situated in one of the industrial parts of town, Midway is surrounded by
low-profile commercial structures. The area generates relatively few noise
complaints and, consequently, is favored by regional airlines as well as by
corporate operators.
   Several large Chicago-based corporations have built their own hangar and
service areas on the field.
   Until three years ago, regional-airline traffic had grown to a volume
where a mandatory slot system had become necessary. This was dropped when
several airlines ceased operations. Recently, Southwest Airlines (as well
as several other carriers) established operations at Midway, and plans for
a new airline terminal are under way. At the same time, there is talk of
reinstating the slot system.
   Signature at KMDW, which is managed by Brent Nielson, is in a large
hangar complex on the west side of the airport. The Signature FBO provides
all the standard services including on-site deicing, and is the only
general-aviation FAA repair station on the airport.
   All of the Signature trademark specials are in evidence: flight-planning
services, crew cars, lounge and rest areas, popcorn and mountain bikes.
(Demand for mountain bikes has been light, however.)
Just next door is the Million Air facility managed by Michael Kieffer. The
ramp and reception areas are large and welcoming.
   Monarch Air Service, also on the west side of the airport, is the base
for Duncan Avionics. Monarch, which is the oldest FBO on the airport,
services many of the lighter aircraft.
   Landing fees are pegged at $2.55 per thousand pounds max landing
weight.

AURORA: OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
   Aurora Municipal Airport (ARR) with its 6,500-foot east-west ILS Runway
9 is a good example of an airfield thriving by virtue of its
out-of-the-mainstream location (30-nm southwest of O'Hare). Also, it is
often preferred for its easy access to Chicago business districts via Route
88. In addition, ARR is praised by customers for its FBO services and
facilities, as well as for being in the epicenter of nearby industrial
development. (A Toyota distribution plant is within sight.)
   There are no landing fees, only parking and tiedown charges.
   Aurora is much admired and supported by its community. Frequent civic
events and traditional celebrations take place at the clean and
well-ordered airport. Credit for much of this feeling of good will must go
to Airport Director Robert Rieser, a promotion-oriented administrator who
always has his eye on ways to make the airport more useful to the
community.
   Rieser has prepared a complete ``Summary of Economic Impacts of Aurora
Airport'' and a ``Request for Special Funding for Aurora Airport.'' Both
documents stress the benefits of the airport, as he sees them, and present
a case for building a new 6,500-foot Runway 15-33, and related taxiways.
   His case would seem to be supported by the dramatic increase in
turbine-powered aircraft operations at the airport since the opening of the
present 6,500-foot runway six years ago.
   Two FBOs handle the burgeoning traffic. Lumanair Aviation Services was
established in 1960 by the Luman family and is run by Mike Luman, an active
pilot. In addition to a full range of business-aviation services, Lumanair
operates an FAA repair station and charter business. Lumanair is a Phillips
66 Performance Center.
   Viking Express also operates a busy FBO at ARR-with storage hangars,
charter and air freight. Robert Burwell, the company's president, claims
Viking's fuel prices are 25 percent below the average in the Chicago
region.

DuPAGE: A NEW LOOK
   Architectural modesty is not what the new DuPage Airport (DPA) ad-
ministration and services building is all about. The glass-walled,
three-story structure towers over the ramp at the northwest end of Runway
1L. Thomas H. Fawell, airport director, boasts there is nothing in the new
DuPage Airport environment that calls for modesty.
   Indeed, this general-aviation airport with its 5,100-foot ILS runway
positioned 25-nm west of O'Hare, is determined to attract corporate
operators (as well as small airlines). To accomplish this goal, the DuPage
Airport Commission constructed imposing buildings and integrated all
services such as fueling and maintenance through a central reception center
in the administration building-DuPage Flight Center. Further, the
Commission built an 18-hole golf course and business-meeting center next
door.
   According to Fawell, since its opening in 1994, the golf course and
business center already are contributing about a half-million dollars a
year to the operation of the airport, which is expected to be profitable at
least by the year 2000.
   Transient aircraft traffic is increasing daily as the policy of no
service charges or landing fees becomes well known. Fawell also expects the
heavy investment in modern snow removal and deicing equipment to begin
paying off as more aircraft divert to DuPage after the efficacy of its
equipment proves itself.
   ``We have more sophisticated ice removal and snow-removal equipment per
square foot of runway than O'Hare,'' says Fawell.
   Requests for maintenance and other services may be made directly to
DuPage Flight Center, the focal point of the airport. The staff will then
act as a guide to the wide range of FBO services available at the airport.
   In addition to being a Phillips 66 Performance Center, avionics sales
and repair, major and minor airframe and powerplant maintenance as well as
fixed and rotary wing charter are all available on the airport through the
DuPage Flight Center. Among the crew benefits offered by DuPage Flight
Center is a complete exercise room with adjoining lounge and quiet rooms.

PALWAUKEE: THE NECESSARY OPTION
   Palwaukee Municipal Airport (KPWK) sits in the middle of a busy shopping
and light-industry area, a mere eight-nm north of O'Hare. The extended
center line of its Runway 16 ILS just about bisects the area between
O'Hare's Runways 14L/32R and 4L/22R. Takeoffs on KPWK Runway 16 are limited
to aircraft that have a standard turn radius of less than 5,000 feet. A
note on the Palwaukee Two SID says, ``This [turn radius] will ensure
separation from the Runway 14R final approach course'' at O'Hare.
   It is certainly true that occasionally, movements at Palwaukee are a
tight squeeze with its neighbor to the south. But for hundreds of operators
each year, KPWK is the airport offering the best service in the area.
   Many long-time operators at Palwaukee say the principal reason for such
enduring respect and admiration is Priester Aviation, the major FBO and
veteran service provider on the airport. Charlie Priester, who founded the
operation and owned the airport in 1952, still is a part-owner and daily
worker. In 1986, he sold the airport and a large part of the Priester
operation to the local community. Today, his son, Mike, is a part of the
still-growing Priester activities at the airport, although the majority
ownership is held by a small group of investors. These backers include
Richard Ferris, former chairman of United Airlines, Arnold Palmer,
celebrity golf pro, and Mark McCormack, head of a management corporation.
   On an average day, the ramp area outside the Priester operation often
resembles the corporate-aircraft display area at an NBAA convention.
Elsewhere on the airport, new hangars are under construction.
   Another construction project at KPWK will add more clear area at each
end of the 5,100-foot Runway 16/34. The planned improvements also will
allow the Runway 16 ILS localizer, which is now offset three degrees, to be
centered, resulting in lower minimums.
   Because of an increase in international flights by its customers,
Priester arranged with U.S. Customs to establish a special clearance
facility paid for by Priester and by arriving international flights, at the
airport. Other improvements include the planned construction of a new tower
and a new Priester reception/administration building in an area being
cleared in the northeast corner of the airport.
   Priester imposes a minimum fuel-service charge, combined with a
fuel-discount price program. According to Mike Pryor, Priester marketing
manager, the service charge is rarely imposed, since the minimum fuel
purchase is almost invariably met.
   Priester is not noted for promotions or gimmicks to entice customers.
But, the company does have its One-Stop Check-In program. Here is how it
works: After appropriate screening and suitable notification, aircraft crew
personnel can simply check in at the Priester reception desk and pick up
two keys. One is for the rental car waiting outside (with all paperwork
having been completed), and the second is for a pre-registered room in a
nearby hotel.
   The other FBOs on the airport-American Flyers, predominantly a flight
school, and Service Aviation-attract primarily piston aircraft.

WAUKEGAN: `PRESIDENTIAL SERVICE'
   Waukegan Regional Airport (UGN), 25-nm north of O'Hare and 17-nm north
of Palwaukee, is outside the heavy airway-traffic zone of close-in Chicago
airports. However, it is near enough to downtown Chicago to be easily
reached by ground transportation. An additional incentive for using UGN is
its proximity to Chicago's Gold Coast, the string of upscale towns and
residential areas along the western shore of Lake Michigan, north of
Chicago.
   The airport has an ILS on Runway 23, plus a complex of administration
and reception buildings on the south side of the field. On the northwest
corner sits an impressively long row of ``high-tail'' individual hangars to
accommodate a flock of aircraft owned by major corporations in the area.
   Airport services are dominated by DB Aviation and its founder, CEO and
president Daniel A. Bitton.
   Bitton recently acquired most of the other FBOs on the field, including
the former Trans Air Aviation and Byrne Aviation, and rolled their fuel
service, avionics repair and maintenance capabilities into DB Aviation FBO,
a wholly owned subsidiary of DB Aviation.
   DB Aviation's goal is epitomized in its presidential-service logo. For
Bitton, this is no idle promotional gambit. The simulated presidential seal
is a reminder to all employees that they must reach for perfection in
carrying out their jobs.

MEIGS: CHICAGO'S HOMETOWN AIRPORT
   For many of those attending a convention at Chicago's huge McCormack
Place, a sports event at Soldier Field, or a meeting in any one of the
Chicago lakefront office buildings, the most convenient arrival is by
aircraft into Meigs Field. Meigs, practically in downtown Chicago's lap,
consists of a single, 3,899-foot, north-south VFR runway, a large parking
ramp and a pleasant reception/administration building. Signature Flight
Support is the FBO, managed by Sharon Lockhart. The airport occupies a
narrow strip along the eastern perimeter of Chicago's busy downtown and
Lake Michigan. From Meigs, a taxi ride can have you in the heart of the
city in 10 minutes.
   Meigs, with its restricted visual approach procedure, is essentially VFR
only. A VASI provides three-degree vertical guidance. The airport is
completely closed between 2200 and 0600 hours local.
   Many corporate-aircraft operators with medium to large aircraft prohibit
operations at the airport except in emergencies.
   In spite of its limitations, the airport regularly logs over 10,000
movements a year. According to a Chicago city estimate, most of these are
from travel initiated by people who are conducting business in downtown
Chicago.
   A landing fee of $2.25 per thousand pounds is imposed at Meigs, and a
daily parking fee of the same amount is charged after the first 30
minutes.
   The airport was constructed on a landfill site originally used for the
World's Fair of 1933. Following the Fair, the land was turned over to the
Chicago Park District and, in 1946, it was leased to the city to build an
airport. The lease expires in September, and the city is not planning to
renew it. Many business people and aviation organizations are vigorously
resisting such a move.

MILWAUKEE: CLAIMING A PRESENCE
   Milwaukee's airport authority loudly claims that General Mitchell
International Airport (KMKE) should be recognized as Chicago's third major
airline facility. But most corporate- aviation operators have a different
perspective. For conducting business in the Milwaukee area or in case of a
need to divert, it is nice to know that KMKE-with four precision approaches
and Category II and III capability- is only 57-nm north of O'Hare.
   A first-class, full-service Signature Flight Support facility, managed
by Jerry Grabner, is on the east side of the field. Hotels and restaurants
are nearby, as is the Harley Davidson manufacturing plant. If you don't
need General Mitchell's 8,000-foot and 9,500-foot runways, another suitable
airport of more modest size is just 10-nm farther to the northwest.
   Timmerman Airport (MWC), with a 4,100-foot runway, is barely out of
Milwaukee's northern suburbs and, accordingly, is sensitive about noise.
   Jet operations (except for Citations) require prior approval, and all
jet operations are limited to between 0545 and 2300 hours.
   Gran-Aire, the full-service FBO located on the west side of the airport,
is managed by Christopher Wodushek.

ALLIEDSIGNAL'S ENHANCED GPWS
GPS positioning precision, a terrain database and moving-map graphics
significantly improve situational awareness.

By:
Fred George

   C. Donald Bateman, AlliedSignal Commercial Avionics Systems' chief
engineer of Flight Safety Systems, has an iron stomach, which is an
essential part of his job description. Bateman has pored over hundreds of
controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT) accident reports to find out why
flightcrews flew otherwise well-working airplanes into the ground,
frequently snuffing out the lives of all on board.
   ``You're 20 times more likely to be involved in a CFIT accident than a
mid-air collision,'' Bateman claims. Armed with those statistics, he has
been in the forefront of GPWS development for more than 26 years.
   GPWS, mandated by the federal government two decades ago on airliners,
didn't enter service as pilots' favorite avionics box on board the
aircraft. Early systems were simplistic aural warning devices, highly prone
to nuisance or false alarms because they merely reacted to inputs from
barometric and radio altimeters.
   During its 20-year maturation, however, GPWS has evolved into a more-
effective safety system that is much less likely to ``cry wolf.'' Current
versions blend radio altimeter inputs with ILS glideslope and discrete
signals from gear and flap systems in order to modulate the thresholds at
which warnings occur. The intent is to eliminate most nuisance alarms.
However, enough false alarms still occur to cause some pilots to discount
GPWS warnings.
   Purely reactive GPWS has another problem: It can't look ahead at terrain
to help the pilot anticipate having to fly an avoidance maneuver. As a
result, the aircraft has to fly in close proximity of the terrain prior to
receiving a GPWS alert.
   Bateman's latest project is Enhanced GPWS, about which we first reported
in B/CA's June 1994 issue (``Enhancing GPWS Data,'' page 82). In contrast
to first-generation, reactive ground prox boxes, EGPWS will anticipate
terrain hazards well before they pose a threat to the aircraft. The system
provides both an aural alert and a visual display of proximate terrain on
an EFIS screen or a weather radar indicator.
   EGPWS retains the well-proven, reactive ground proximity warning
functions of older generation GPWS thus making possible FAA certification
of the new system under the existing TSO regulation.
   EGPWS uses ARINC 453, the weather radar data bus, to send full-color
terrain graphics to display systems, because it's the most common graphics
interface. As a result, weather radar graphics or terrain imagery may be
displayed on a screen, but not simultaneously. Some display systems can be
configured (at the option of the buyer) to automatically switch to terrain
imagery in the event of a terrain alert. Certain display systems also can
be configured to automatically change range scale to 10 miles to help crews
focus on the location of the terrain hazard if a terrain alert occurs.

TERRAIN DATABASE
   AlliedSignal engineers obtained a global-terrain elevation model from
the U.S. Department of Commerce. The model divides most of the Earth's
surface into 30-arc-second blocks-equivalent to one-half-mile squares at
the equator. The exceptions are countries that, for military security
reasons, don't want to release details of their terrain contours to the
public.
   Omitted from the terrain elevation database, for example, is information
about North and South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, southern Japan and
Okinawa, as well most South American countries with borders in the Andes
Mountains. Most of Africa, however, along with Russia, Mongolia and China
are included, as well as North America and Europe.
   The terrain-elevation model, nonetheless, is enormous in size--far
larger than the database storage capacity of any civil-production digital
avionics system. Bateman's team of engineers solved the storage-capacity
problem by limiting the use of the high resolution, 30-arc-second terrain
elevation blocks to circular areas within a 16-mile radius of database
airports. In the 16- to 30-mile rings from the airports, the terrain
elevation divisions are compressed into one-minute blocks-one-half the data
density of the terrain data closest to the airports. From 30 to 60 miles,
two-minute terrain blocks are used. Outside of 60 miles, the terrain model
is compressed into four-arc-minute blocks. The logic is that civil aircraft
aren't likely to operate close to the Earth's surface except when departing
or approaching landing facilities.
   Pilots will find EGPWS's airport database impressive and large-
including all public-use and military airports with hard-surfaced or
unpaved runways at least 3,500 feet long. As a result, many of the airport
circles overlap, thus providing far better than four-arc-minute resolution
over large areas. For example, most of the mountainous terrain within a
120-nm radius of Aspen, Colorado is divided into 30-arc-second, one- and
two- arc-minute blocks.
   Fifty or so airports with particularly steep, proximate terrain, such as
Juneau and Dutch Harbor, Alaska, will get even higher terrain block
resolution-15-arc-minute divisions, resulting in one-quarter-mile-square
maximum block areas.

AURAL ALERTS, THREAT DISPLAY
   EGPWS compares the aircraft's GPS position and barometric altitude with
the location of the terrain elevation contours in the database to compute
possible terrain hazards.
   Caution alerts are triggered when EGPWS anticipates encountering-in one
minute or less-a terrain hazard block that is as much as 800 feet below the
aircraft. A synthesized voice sounds, ``Caution, terrain.''
   Similarly, warning alerts are triggered when the system predicts a
terrain hazard approaching in one minute or less that is as much as 400
feet below the aircraft. The system warns, ``Terrain ahead. Pull up!
Terrain ahead. Pull up!'' Both the caution and warning avoidance maneuvers
are based on a one-quarter-g vertical acceleration.
   As shown in the accompanying illustrations, the caution and warning
alert envelopes are modulated as a function of aircraft ground speed,
airport proximity, vertical flight path, turn radius and aircraft altitude
versus airport elevation. Bateman's goal was to produce an effective safety
system with maximum credibility because of designed-in immunity to nuisance
or false alarms.

VISUAL BACKGROUND DISPLAY
   In addition to the aural and visual threat alerts, EGPWS also provides a
background terrain display on the screen when the aircraft operates within
a specified, computed ground proximity envelope. The screen remains black
when the aircraft is in level flight, and all terrain elevations within the
maximum selected display range are more than 2,000 feet below the
aircraft's barometric altitude.
   Relative terrain block elevations that are less than 2,000 feet below
the aircraft are displayed in varying densities of green, yellow and red as
a function of terrain elevation versus aircraft altitude. For example, when
the aircraft is parked at the ramp in non-mountainous areas, the screen
should be flooded with 25-percent density yellow dots, indicating that all
the terrain elevations are at or above the aircraft altitude. Green is
reserved for terrain elevations below the aircraft, but within 2,000 feet
of its altitude. There is no background display for terrain more than 2,000
feet below the aircraft, if it is in level flight.
   The various elevation floors, upon which the background colors and
pattern densities are based, also are modulated as a half function of
aircraft descent rate. If the aircraft is descending at 2,000 fpm, for
instance, all the background display floors are moved down by 1,000 feet.
   Aural alert envelopes also trigger a visual threat display. An aural
caution alert is indicated by a hazardous block illuminated in solid
yellow. The terrain block turns bright red in the event of an aural-warning
alert.

FLYING WITH EGPWS
   In September 1995, we rode along on a EGPWS demonstration flight in
AlliedSignal's Beech King Air C90. Departing from Snohomish County Paine
Field in Washington State, we flew up the Stillaquamish River valley, deep
in the Cascade Mountains. As we approached terrain on either side of the
valley, the background display indicated its location and elevation
relative to the aircraft's position and altitude. A black corridor on the
screen indicated the location of the valley floor, thereby helping us to
stay on a safe course.
   Approaching a ridge line at the end of the valley that towered 1,000
feet above the aircraft's altitude, EGPWS issued a ``caution terrain''
alert, and the display automatically changed from 80-mile scale to 10-mile
scale. The gently rising terrain leading to the ridge triggered the caution
alert at three miles (about one minute away), and the corresponding
elevation blocks on the screen were displayed in bright yellow. Shortly
thereafter, the reactive GPWS function also alerted us to the impending
hazard. A gentle pull on the yoke and an increase in power resulted in our
safely climbing above the hazard.
   After clearing the ridge, we switched to 80-mile scale and started a
gentle turn. We were impressed with EGPWS' ability to ``look ahead'' to
distant terrain such as 10,560-feet-high Glacier Peak. This summit was
displayed as blocks of red on the screen because its relative elevation was
more than 2,000 feet above the aircraft's altitude.
   The most impressive feature of the system, though, was its ability to
provide a timely terrain-hazard alert as we approached the sharply rising
Three Fingers peak due east of Arlington, Washington. As we flew to within
seven miles of Three Fingers, EGPWS anticipated the impending hazard. The
aural alert sounded ``caution, terrain'' and the threat display on the
moving map illuminated the hazardous terrain elevation in a bright yellow
block.
   We intentionally pressed closer, causing EGPWS to twice sound ``Terrain
ahead. Pull up!'' The display automatically changed to 10-mile scale, and
the appropriate terrain elevation blocks turned bright red.
   We pulled up only enough to clear the peak by a legal 500 feet and just
after clearing it, the reactive GPWS function-the one mandated by the FAA
for airliners-warned us with a ``Terrain! Terrain!'' alert. If we had been
depending upon reactive GPWS alone for terrain avoidance, we would have
never heard the warning, and the NTSB would have sifted through the
fragments looking for accident clues.
   EGPWS will be standard equipment on the Gulfstream V, and several
airlines are upgrading to the system. The system, though, provides a
large-scale improvement in situational awareness that will attract the
attention of many other aircraft manufacturers and business-aircraft
operators.
   EGPWS currently is priced at $59,233, which is close to twice the cost
of standard ground prox boxes. Its ability to anticipate terrain hazards,
however, and its virtual immunity to ``cry-wolf'' false alarms are a
quantum technological leap over current generation GPWS.

JET SUPPORT EMS PROGRAM (PAGE 72)
Once considered an upstart, JSSI is making inroads as the only independent
in the power-by-the-hour game.

By:
Perry Bradley

   It wasn't so long ago that mention of Jet Support Services, Incorporated
would most likely have met with a resounding, ``Who?''
Not so these days. Since its launch in 1989, JSSI of Chicago has steadily
added customers and says its portfolio of powerplants in the Engine
Maintenance Systems (EMS) program-the only independent engine-maintenance
program in the corporate marketplace-will top 500 in the first quarter of
this year.
   As with programs offered through original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs), operators pay a fixed fee into the EMS kitty based on the number of
hours they fly. In exchange, JSSI pays for scheduled and unscheduled
maintenance. In practice, the programs are slightly more complicated, but
they essentially allow operators to dial in hourly operating costs and
insure themselves against maintenance hits that are not in the budget.
   JSSI's strategy for penetrating the often skeptical corporate-aviation
market is forthright and logical: Offer more-flexible programs than the
competitors', offer them at favorable rates, and stay focused on customer
service. And according to operators we polled, the company is succeeding on
all fronts.

SAFETY NET
   The company provided B/CA with a complete list of its customers from
which we sampled a selection of operators, being careful to poll from all
areas of the country and from operators of various engines for which EMS is
offered. Operators ranged from a large Fortune 500 company with 11 aircraft
in the fleet to single-aircraft operators. Aircraft ranged from a Sikorsky
S-76 to Gulfstream IVs.
   Overall, the opinion of the program was very favorable. ``On a scale of
one to 10, the lowest mark I'd give them in any category would be a nine,''
commented one Falcon 10 operator.
   Most operators said they view EMS as a financial-planning tool that
provides stable budgeting, even though many said they feel the program, in
the long run, costs more than self-insuring. ``The CFO likes an insurance
program,'' said one. ``From a cash-flow point of view, I can't argue
that.''
   Operators rated customer support as high, and most said they planned to
renew at the end of their five-year terms and would recommend the program
to a colleague. The criticism most often voiced was that JSSI's expertise
is deeper in finance than it is in technical support.
   One of the hallmarks of JSSI's program is flexibility. Unlike OEM
programs, JSSI will insure virtually any engine. (See accompanying chart.)
Service is available at any factory-authorized service center. Although
AlliedSignal TFE731s make up nearly 75 percent of the enrolled engines,
JSSI also covers everything from Allison 250 helicopter engines to
Rolls-Royce Speys and Tays. Mixed-fleet operators said the ability to use
only one source to cover all their engines was a major attraction.
   The company also offers operators a variety of buy-in options as an
enticement to add airplanes to the program. Although the portfolio includes
some new aircraft, many of the aircraft are added to the program at resale,
either by brokers or by new owners. According to JSSI President Rick
Haskins, the typical customer is the second owner of an airplane that was
not originally on an engine program, or it is an operator upgrading to jet
equipment for the first time.
   However, some operators with new aircraft are on the program. During the
warranty period, JSSI covers all scheduled maintenance, and picks up
coverage of unscheduled maintenance when the warranty expires. Because JSSI
requires operators to use factory-authorized service centers, warranty
coverage isn't affected by the program. On some engines, operators pay a
reduced rate during their warranty period.
   Several operators we talked with put used aircraft on the program just
after buying them. The enrollment fee ranges from $15,000 to $25,000 for
used aircraft; brand-new aircraft can be enrolled for $2,500. JSSI also
requires a ``Pre-Induction Diagnostic Survey''-a thorough examination of
the engine that runs about $2,500 for each powerplant.
   JSSI lets operators buy into the program with either a lump sum that
brings the engine up to date on the program, or through a pro-rata program.
While one operator did a 100-percent buy-in, most said a major attraction
was JSSI's lower enrollment price through the pro-rata program.
   Many operators said they opted for EMS because the buy-in was far
cheaper than for competing OEM programs. The competitor most often
mentioned was AlliedSignal's Maintenance Service Plan. (See
``AlliedSignal's Maintenance Service Plan,'' B/CA, March 1995, page 52.) A
broker that routinely puts TFE731-powered aircraft on engine programs said
he shops between MSP and EMS, and ``JSSI wins virtually every time. The
pro-rate makes JSSI more attractive.''
   The pro-rata program is set up as follows: JSSI and the operator share
the cost of the first of each subsequent scheduled event based on the
number of hours on the aircraft when enrolled. For example, if an aircraft
has been flown 1,000 hours and has a 2,500-hour hot-section inspection
interval and a 5,000-hour overhaul limit, the operator would pay 40 percent
of the first hot section, and 20 percent of the overhaul. The pro-rate also
applies to any cycle-limited parts. JSSI covers 100 percent of all
unscheduled maintenance once the contract is inked.
   About half of the operators with whom we spoke added aircraft to EMS at
the time of purchase. Most said the process was straightforward. However,
one operator said he ended up with some confusion over who would pay for
service bulletins. That operator, who flies a Lear 35, said in addition to
his approximately $100,000 pro-rata share of his first major periodic
inspection (MPI), he also had to spend about $16,000 extra per engine on
service bulletins. Another said he ended up paying more for cycle-limited
components than he thought he would have to pay.
   JSSI's policy is to pay for all mandatory or recommended service
bulletins from the date the contract is signed, says Haskins. However,
operators are responsible for any bulletins that pre-date the contract. In
the event an optional bulletin is upgraded to recommended or mandatory
after the contract is signed, JSSI shares the cost on a pro-rated basis.
   Another operator with whom we spoke said he had run into a Catch-22 when
buying a used Westwind. The previous owner was about 35-percent behind on
his payments to JSSI. The prospective buyer said his options amounted to
either paying the back balance, or letting the original contract drop and
re-enrolling the aircraft-a much pricier option.
   Haskins said he wasn't aware of the particular circumstance, but said
owners are required to notify JSSI in advance of a sale, and must have
accounts paid in full before transferring their coverage. Starting January
1, 1995, JSSI instituted a new policy that penalizes late payments, and EMS
contracts stipulate that falling behind in payments can be construed as
breach of contract. Still, if you're considering buying an airplane on EMS,
it's a good idea to make sure JSSI has been notified and that the account
is current.

OEM INDEPENDENCE
   Another major attraction to EMS is its independence from the engine
manufacturer, according to many of the operators. ``I was hell-bent on not
going with another factory program,'' said a Lear 60 operator who had a
Lear 35 on MSP and shopped EMS versus Pratt & Whitney's factory program for
the PW305 when the flight department got the new airplane. ``I just feel
better with a neutral party.''
   Several operators said they sense an inherent conflict of interest in
having the factory also manage maintenance of their engines. One complaint
often voiced was that money paid for factory-sponsored programs seems to
subsidize repairs to the entire fleet of engines. For instance, ADs often
are paid for by the OEM, regardless of whether an engine is covered or
not.
   Still, independence wasn't a virtue for all the customers. One Lear 35
chief pilot who currently is on EMS said his first preference would be to
forego the program altogether and self-insure by setting aside reserves.
But if he had to pick a maintenance program, he would prefer to go with the
OEM. Asked why, he said, ``JSSI's sole purpose is to make money.''
The financial aspect of the arrangement generated a lot of comments.
Operators were nearly unanimous in describing EMS as primarily a financial
program, and a good one at that. However, on the technical side, there was
a stark difference of opinion.
   ``As a financial tool set, it rates a 10 out of 10, but on the technical
side, they're pretty weak,'' said one operator with a fleet of aircraft on
the program. ``I'd like to be able to just call and say it's broken and
hang up.'' Instead, he said he finds himself as involved in maintenance as
he would be if his company were self insured. Another operator said he
thinks of JSSI as offering a clerical function.
   Haskins says he's aware of the perception that the company is more
financial than technical. He and Marla Rabin, vice president for
administration and finance, worked together in investment banking before
launching JSSI in 1989, with what he concedes was a limited background in
aviation. One of the company's goals for this year is to hire more
technical staff.
   The technical component of JSSI is run by Karl Florian, who joined the
company two years ago after a career with the Xerox flight department.
Approximately 15 contractors work with JSSI in the field, representing the
company at various maintenance shops where clients take engines for
service. Rep-resentatives are routinely dispatched to oversee major
scheduled events.
   For unscheduled work, the severity of the problem dictates whether a
field rep is dispatched or not.
   ``We're very happy with our technical staff, but I think we need to put
more people in the field,'' says Haskins. ``The ideal guy shows up in his
suit and tie, but in his trunk he also has a pair of coveralls.''
   While some of those surveyed said the technical side was weak, others
complained that it was too much a presence. Because it is an independent
engine maintenance company, JSSI acts as a middle man between the operator
and the service facility. The company sends a representative to oversee
scheduled maintenance as well as major unscheduled events.
   One operator complained that getting pre-authorization from JSSI seemed
inevitably to result in delays. However, another said that JSSI's
involvement speeded the process. A Falcon 10 operator said parts shortages
threatened to add significantly to downtime on an overhaul, but ``JSSI beat
the bushes, found the parts, and got my engine going again.''
A chief of maintenance at a company with a Westwind in charter service
offered an interesting perspective. ``They'll slow a job down, but the
other extreme is people who view factory programs as a blank check.'' Prior
to joining the flight department, he worked with a maintenance facility
that did a considerable chunk of work on factory-covered engines. He said
he felt that oftentimes new parts were installed where repaired or reworked
parts would have been more cost effective. ``It's kind of like health
care,'' he said. ``When an insurer is paying $10 for Band-Aids, that drives
the cost up for everyone. JSSI really keeps the costs down.''

IN THE TRENCHES
When it comes to actually getting work done, operators rate JSSI's service
as excellent. Virtually all had undergone scheduled maintenance, and many
of the operators also had needed to call on JSSI in an emergency. In one
case, an operator had an AOG at a remote Nevada airport on a weekend. ``I
was in a conference call with JSSI and a maintenance facility within 10
minutes,'' he said. ``If I was an independent and not on an insurance
program, I wouldn't have known where to start calling.''
   Another operator had his first experience with the program even before
buying an airplane. During a pre-purchase inspection, an engine facility
noted vibration that was close to being outside specifications. The
previous owner called JSSI, which authorized a fan balance. ``I'm really
impressed with them,'' the subsequent purchaser said. ``I became
comfortable with them immediately.''
   One operator with whom we spoke said he was new to the program and had
just 1,700 hours (in relation to a 4,500-hour overhaul limit) on his
engines, but was experiencing chronic temperature problems on one side. A
service facility eventually recommended an overhaul. ``JSSI said no
problem,'' he says. Another operator needed work done in the core of his
engine some 1,000 hours before the stipulated overhaul limit. JSSI not only
backed the work, but also encouraged him to go ahead with the full
overhaul. ``What JSSI did really gave me a favorable opinion. They jumped
in and agreed to pay for lots of extra things that weren't in the
contract,'' he said. ``They just kept making it a better deal.''
   Asked about ``fine-print'' issues, few operators had any complaints.
``Where there's a gray area, they seem to come down on the operator's
side,'' said one. One operator noted that his company's legal staff
reviewed JSSI's contract prior to signing up, and returned it to the flight
department without any recommended changes.
   None of the operators said they had any trouble with the paperwork
aspects of the program. JSSI supplies forms that are filled out monthly.
Operators simply fill in the blanks, multiplying the hours flown by the
hourly fee to arrive at the total due for the month. On most of the engines
it covers, JSSI also pays for operators to participate in trend-monitoring
programs.

RESALE BOOSTER
   In addition to the claimed benefit they derive while on the program,
many operators said they feel JSSI also pays dividends when it comes time
to sell their aircraft.
   Brokers say that aircraft on engine programs tend to sell faster and
often for more money than non-covered aircraft. And aircraft value guides
give additional credit for aircraft that have engines on insurance
programs. The amount of the credit ranges from the value of a single
overhaul to treating the engines as though they were zero-time.
   Fletcher Aldredge, publisher of the Vref Aircraft Value Reference, said
JSSI is gaining acceptance in the marketplace, and that awareness of the
program is increasing. ``Anything new has a major sell job, but EMS is
definitely one of the services that's gaining acceptance,'' he said.
   Several operators who had purchased used aircraft confirmed that the
airplane's having been on
an engine program was a factor in their decision. ``I wanted to get an
airplane that was on a program especially because it was our first jet,''
said one.
   JSSI's flexibility extends to resale. Operators can leave the program
with the airplane, presumably recovering some of their cost in the
transaction. The transfer fee is $2,500. However, operators also can sell
their aircraft without the coverage, retaining their reserves for
application on a new aircraft.
   ``What we're doing here is leaving the dollars with the flight
department,'' says Haskins. ``It allows the flight department to make
productive choices about how they want to use their assets.''
   If the engine coverage is retained, JSSI gives the operator use of the
reserves paid into the program, minus the company's monthly management fee
and any money already expended on maintenance. The remaining balance can be
applied toward the buy-in for another aircraft or for hourly operating
fees. However, operators cannot opt for a cash rebate.
   JSSI has come a long way in six years. While it's still a small company,
its acceptance and list of clients is growing. A key company focus is
service. ``We want to serve our customers like they are treated in a
mom-and-pop type of shop as opposed to having them feel like they're just a
number,'' said JSSI's Marla Rabin. ``We want to grow, but we want to have
the mentality of a small company.''
   So far, the strategy appears to be working. Said one operator,
``Whenever you tell your boss to invest this kind of money, you want
assurance you've done the right thing. After a year and a half on the
program, I'm sure we did the right thing.''

JSSI LANDS A BIG ONE
   Business JetSolutions, the joint venture between Bombardier and AMR
Combs, recently contracted with JSSI for coverage of its FlexJet
fractional-ownership aircraft.
   JetSolutions compared JSSI's EMS program with OEM programs and
self-insuring, concluding it was cheaper than the OEM options and only
slightly more expensive than socking away reserves, according to Dennis
Keith, vice president of marketing and sales. ``We did an analysis on
engine costs and reserves, and the marginal difference in cost, compared to
what JSSI can do it for was just not worth the hassle,'' says Keith. ``It
boils down to a small insurance premium.''
   Another factor in selecting EMS, Keith said, is having just one vendor
that covers JetSolution's entire fleet, which includes General Electric
CF34s on the Challengers, Pratt & Whitney Canada PW305s on the Lear 60s and
AlliedSignal TFE731-2s on the Lear 31As. Finally, JetSolutions felt the
programs would increase resale value of the aircraft shares, providing
owners with higher residual value.
   JetSolution's initial fleet includes 14 aircraft. As of mid-November
1995, the company said its customer base was ``well into the double
digits.'' As part of the JSSI agreement, aircraft owners in JetSolutions'
Alliance Plus management arm also receive discounts on EMS enrollment fees
and hourly rates.

OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS
   Rick Haskins and Marla Rabin were working in the investment-banking
business when they were approached with the idea of starting an independent
engine-maintenance program in late 1988. A couple of months later they
rented office space; and a year after that, they signed their first
client.
   ``We kind of wanted to try something on our own to see if all this
advice we'd been dispensing really worked,'' Haskins says modestly. ``So we
just did it.''
   Haskins serves as president of JSSI, while Rabin is vice president for
administration and finance. The third founder was Ron Zilberbrand, who
heads up the sales effort. Early on, the company was regarded as ``kind of
cute,'' Haskins says. Now, it's taken a little more seriously-both by OEMs
and by operators shopping for protection against unscheduled maintenance
expense.
   ``Our market is anybody with any budget sensitivity, whether it's a huge
Fortune 500 company or a little guy who's a charter operator,'' says
Haskins. ``Budget sensitivity is the critical path.''
   One of the unique aspects about JSSI is its ability to cover virtually
any turbine engine. While AlliedSignal TFE731s make up the bulk of its
portfolio, the company covers 17 different engine types, including
everything from Turbomeca and Allison helicopter engines to Pratt & Whitney
Canada PT-6s to P&WC JT15s and AlliedSignal APUs.
   How can the company handle so many engine types? For one, Director of
Technical Services Karl Florian does extensive research with operators,
OEMs and service facilities to help set hourly rates. However, just as
important, Haskins and Rabin say, is the company's basic structure. ``If
you have the management systems and management techniques in place, there
shouldn't be any reason in the turbine world why you shouldn't be able to
handle an engine,'' says Haskins. The company also recently announced a
joint venture with Stevens Aviation that will provide nose-to-tail coverage
of King Air 200s for a base rate of $390 per hour (B/CA, November 1995,
page 28).
   JSSI makes its money from enrollment fees-$2,500 for a brand-new
aircraft and a range of about $15,000 to $25,000 for used aircraft-and from
extracting a management fee from the hourly charge that clients pay for
engine operations. However, the remainder of the monthly fee goes into a
trust that exists outside JSSI's corporate structure. JSSI can't spend the
money for corporate purposes, nor does it derive any interest income from
the third-party irrevocable trust, which is administered by LaSalle
National Bank. The company is authorized to spend money only for engine
repair and maintenance, and carries an insurance policy that backs up the
trust.
   Haskins and Rabin attribute the company's success to the flexibility of
its programs and to a strong customer-service orientation. So far,
operators of some 500 engines seem to agree, and the company is
experiencing a perfect renewal record as the first of its five-year
contracts begin to run out.
   The strategy for the future is to continue to grow without forgetting
what got them where they are today. ``The worry we have is how far and how
fast we can expand without losing what got us here, and what got us here is
customer advocacy,'' says Rabin.

SAAB 2000 EXECUTIVE SHUTTLE
One of the fastest production turboprop airliners flies 36 people at
near-jetliner speeds.

By:
Fred George

   Saab 5123L, confirm that you are a turboprop,'' inquired a Washington
Center controller on the day we flew the Saab 2000. His inflection was
unmistakable: ``Aren't you actually a jet?'' We imagined that he thumped
his aging computer console a couple of times, trying to clear its digital
cobwebs, as he watched us climb out of Dulles at 240 KIAS. At 37,000
pounds, the Saab 2000 admittedly was well below its 50,260 pounds MTOW,
with only a few passengers on board. The relatively light weight, however,
doesn't discount the Saab 2000's performance accomplishments.
   The climb to FL 310 took 19 minutes from brake release, which is
respectable for a high-performance turboprop. However, without ATC delays,
we would have reached that flight level in 16 minutes-more like the average
jetliner. After one minute at FL 310 in ISA+4C conditions, the Saab 2000
settled into a 368 KTAS cruise while burning 1,920 pph.
   After level off, we had to pull back the power levers to avoid pushing
through the 0.62 Mach Mmo red barber pole on the primary flight display.
There was plenty of energy remaining in the engines, with the power levers
in the max-cruise position.
   Saab's recipe for spirited climb performance and jet-like cruise speed
is a classic, three-part blend: lean fuselage cross section,
high-aspect-ratio wing and huge turbine engines. The fuselage cross section
is taken from the Saab 340, but it is stretched 24 feet overall, resulting
in 20.67 feet more cabin length for the passengers, and up to 120 cubic
feet more baggage volume depending on interior configuration. The wing,
which is a scaled up version of the one on the Saab 340, retains its 11:1
aspect ratio and relatively thick chord section.
   Most of the credit for the performance gains, though, goes to the
Rolls-Royce Allison AE2100A turboprop engines which, at their 3,770-shp
normal takeoff rating, offer twice the power of the Saab 340's General
Electric CT7 engines, and even more at their 4,152-shp APR rating. Notably,
both normal and APR horsepower ratings are available up to 36C (97F).

LONG LEGS, SHORT HOPS
   When needed, the Saab 2000 Executive Shuttle can fly 36 passengers 1,289
nm with NBAA IFR reserves, at an average cruise speed of 360 KTAS,
according to the aircraft operations manual (AOM). Slow down to a
long-range cruise speed of 280 KTAS and, if needed, you could fly more than
1,600 nm.
   Most missions, however, are likely to be in the 200- to 400-nm range,
based on the projections of the one Executive Shuttle operator in the
United States and the experience of Switzerland's Crossair, which now has
amassed more than 55,000 flight hours in the Saab 2000.
   Short-haul missions and density-altitude performance are the Saab 2000's
strong suits. In comparison to the Canadair RJ, the Saab 2000 burns three
percent less fuel on a 300-nm trip, but it is only seven minutes slower.
The Saab 2000's fuel economy advantage, compared to the Canadair RJ's,
disappears with longer-range trips, and its slower speed results in
noticeably longer trip times.
   The corporate operator with whom we spoke (wishing to remain anonymous)
said the company looked at other 36-seat aircraft, but all were slower than
the 295 KTAS cruise-speed turboprops they currently fly. The operator
estimates that the Saab 2000 will burn one-third less fuel and offer a
75-knot speed advantage, compared to its current shuttle aircraft. The firm
selected the Saab 2000 because it will save them 10 minutes to 20 minutes
per leg, compared to any other 36-seat turboprop. The flight department
ruled out a 50-passenger regional jet because of longer runway requirements
and higher operating costs for its average 200-nm mission.
   Fuel economy favors a jetliner-like climb/cruise/descent profile because
it saves as much as 20 percent in fuel consumption. For example, the Saab
2000 can fly 36 passengers 200 nm in 47 minutes with a block fuel burn of
1,450 pounds, according to the AOM. Flying the aircraft anywhere between
13,000 feet and FL 310 on such trips makes less than a one-minute
difference in trip times.
   Hot-and-high airport conditions impose virtually no limitations on the
Saab 2000. It can carry substantially more payload and fly longer legs with
maximum payload compared to the Canadair RJ, especially when departing from
high-density altitude airfields.
   For example, when using the 3,770-shp normal takeoff power (NTOP) rating
and a no-flaps configuration, the Saab 2000 can depart Denver at 38C (100F)
with 36 people and full fuel. The APU, however, must be used for cabin
pressurization during NTOP departures because the engine bleeds are shut
off. (Using reduced, ``flex'' power for takeoff allows the engine bleeds to
be turned on.)
   Crossair's experience with the Saab 2000 provides potential corporate
operators with a credible gauge of the aircraft's day-in and day-out
performance. The Swiss carrier's average trip is 400 nm, and the average
block time is 1+15, according to Thomas Brandt, Crossair's Saab 2000 fleet
chief. He told B/CA that when the Saab 2000 flies at FL 290 to 310, it
cruises at 355 to 365 KTAS, depending on temperature aloft, and that the
block fuel burn for such trips is 2,400 pounds. Crossair also flies the
aircraft on 800- to 1,000-nm charters, such as between Basel, Switzerland
and the Greek Islands, and between Berlin and St. Petersburg, Russia.

PASSENGER ACCOMMODATIONS
   Travelers accustomed to coach seats on jetliners will find slightly more
seat width on the Saab 2000. The cabin seats are 18.1 inches wide on the
right, two-seat side and 18.5 inches wide on the left, single-seat side,
providing about one-half to one inch more width than the average coach
seat. The fuselage's circular shape and its 7.1-foot interior cross
section, however, offer less shoulder room in the window seats than the
comparatively vertical side walls of most jetliners.
   The Executive Shuttle's 36-seat configuration provides the 24 rear
passengers a 34-inch seat pitch, making possible three club-seating
sections in the forward section and resulting in one inch less seat pitch
in the front section.
   The aircraft we flew for this report was completed by AIM Aviation,
Limited of Bournemouth, England. It had leather-covered, fold-out work
tables for passengers in two of the club sections, and fold-down tray
tables for forward-facing seats in the aft cabin. A conventional FAA Type I
entrance is located at the left front of the fuselage for passenger
boarding. A folding boarding ladder, with its operation aided by counter
springs, slides into the passenger door opening from a storage compartment
aft of the cockpit. There is another Type I door at the right rear side of
the aircraft for galley servicing. Left- and right-side Type III emergency
exits are located at mid cabin.
   A single lavatory is located in the forward section of the cabin. Just
aft, there is a 104-cubic-foot carryon storage compartment on the right
side and a 39-cubic-foot coat closet on the left side. The Executive
Shuttle, in contrast to the airliner configuration, has no overhead luggage
compartments adjacent to the passenger seats.
   The aft galley has storage for hot and cold meal service for one serving
to 36 passengers, plus hot and cold beverage storage.
   In the rear section of the pressure vessel, 328 cubic feet of baggage
volume are available in two compartments that are accessible on the ground
by means of a 53-by-51-inch cargo door, and in flight through a door in the
galley area. The aft baggage compartments have a capacity of 2,756 pounds.
(Weight and balance data for the aircraft were not available when we flew
the aircraft, thus we could not check if loading the aft compartment to
capacity would adversely affect the center of gravity under certain
conditions.)

ACTIVE NOISE ATTENUATION
   The Saab 2000's six-blade, Dowty Rotol props turn at only 950 rpm in all
phases of flight other than takeoff. Then, they turn at a modest 1,100 rpm.
Each prop, though, converts enough torque to thrust to propel the Saab 2000
to nearly six miles per minute in cruise.
   Saab uses a combination of dynamic vibration absorbers, acoustical
insulation and an active noise cancellation system to blot up noise and
vibration, with the goal of achieving 76 dBA interior sound levels. While
the active and passive systems are effective, Crossair claims that the
cabin sound level actually is 78 dBA, which exceeds the manufacturer's
specification for the aircraft. Saab is developing an improved sound
attenuation system for the aircraft that will be fitted to the 2000 at a
later date (B/CA, September 1995, page 122).

POWER VERSUS STABILITY AND CONTROL
   The Saab 2000, being the most powerful turboprop ever built by Saab
Aircraft, posed some unique challenges during development that ultimately
led to a one-year delay in certification. Joint Airworthiness Authority
sign-off occurred in March 1994, and the FAA certificated the aircraft in
April 1994. The first production aircraft was delivered to Crossair in
August 1994, but it had c.g.-envelope limitations and performance
shortfalls that were corrected in later production aircraft.
   Saab anticipated considerable directional control forces in the event of
an engine failure, thus it elected to fit the Saab 2000 with a
rudder-by-wire system to help control yaw. Early in 1992, though, Saab's
flight-test engineers also found shortcomings in longitudinal stability, so
they widened the chord of the horizontal stabilizer by seven percent. Saab
originally planned to use a manually operated mechanical elevator control
system (MECS). By mid 1993, however, it became apparent that MECS
limitations would restrict the center of gravity envelope, or ``loadability
range'' as termed by Saab. In addition, the pitch forces associated with
MECS would be considerable, especially at high speeds.
   At that point in the development program, Saab elected to fit the 2000
with a fly-by-wire powered elevator control system, PECS for short, that is
linked to a digital flight-control computer. PECS, similar to fly-by-wire
systems fitted to fighters, allows aerodynamic stability requirements to be
relaxed, thereby permitting the c.g. envelope to be extended by 50 percent,
according to Saab.
   PECS uses a belt-and-braces design for redundancy, including left- and
right-side, dual-channel flight-control computers. These computers provide
the appropriate control-yoke-to-elevator movement, which is geared to
indicated airspeed, along with flap-position trim bias, speed and Mach
pitch trim, and g-force loading. The pitch-trim function is built into the
PECS computers. There is no elevator trim tab. The system greatly reduces
the pitch-control forces because it uses springs for artificial control
feel rather than aerodynamic control surface feedback.
   The spring loaded, artificial pitch-feel system suggests that
pitch-control feel might be numb. Such is not the case. In our opinion,
however, the stick forces seem nicely proportionate throughout most of the
flight envelope because of the pitch-control law fidelity programmed into
the fly-by-wire computer.
   The muscle to move the left and right elevators is provided by two
hydraulic actuators on each side, powered by three independent hydraulic
systems. Pitch control is retained in the event of two out of three
hydraulic system failures or jamming of either the right or left elevator.
In addition, a hydraulic-actuated, emergency-pitch-trim actuator is
connected to the left elevator in case both dual-channel PECS computers
simultaneously fail.
   P-factor is another challenge. Pilots flying the Saab 2000 will have no
difficulty in identifying the left powerplant as the critical engine,
because of the clockwise prop rotation of both engines. The fly-by-wire
rudder system all but eliminates yaw control problems, even when one is
flying the aircraft with one-engine-inoperative. However, manual roll
control makes power-induced roll trim changes quite noticeable.
   Vmca, as a result, is defined more by roll-control limitations than by
rudder authority. Saab intends to reduce Vmca by fitting vortex generators
(VGs) to the leading edges of the ailerons. The VGs will be hidden from the
air flow except when the ailerons are deflected to large angles, thereby
eliminating any drag penalty in cruise. The upgrade will be available by
the middle of this year.
   Counter-rotating props might seem an obvious solution. Saab told B/CA,
however, that such a change would be expensive to engineer, plus both the
engine gear box and the propeller assemblies would be left- or right-side
specific, thus requiring two sets of spares in inventory.
   In our opinion, however, the Saab 2000 would benefit from
counter-rotating propellers because of its prodigious horsepower and large
prop diameter.

SYSTEMS DESIGN
   Other systems reflect Saab's compulsion for rugged construction and
dispatch reliability, about which Crossair had good things to say. With few
exceptions (such as dual nav lights) design emphasis is on component
reliability rather than component redundancy.
   The airframe has a 60,000-hour/75,000-cycle design life and a 24-month
warranty. Other components are warranted for at least 24 months, with a
30-month warranty on the Dowty Rotol propellers and a 36-month warranty on
the engines.
   Avionics and other systems are well integrated for diagnostic functions.
(See sidebar). Many of the normal and abnormal procedures, including most
preflight checks, are automated to reduce pilot workload.
   Engines and propellers are controlled by FADECs for low pilot workload
and high reliability. (See sidebar.) The Sundstrand APU is certificated for
inflight operations, and it starts automatically in the event of an engine
failure. Its three-phase, wild frequency 45kVr AC generator is identical to
generators on the engines, and it can power all electrical equipment. Most
electrical systems are DC-powered-supplied by three transformer rectifier
units. The APU is required for dispatch because it's used to supply bleed
air to start the engines.
   The fuel system, similar to the Saab 340's, uses wet-wing fuel tanks
with cross-feed, single-point pressure refueling (15 minutes maximum) and
gravity fill functions. Extendable sight gauges in the bottom of the tanks
allow the crew to crosscheck fuel quantity on preflight without having to
use dipsticks. The fuel-boost pumps are located in dry canisters that allow
removal and replacement without defueling.
   Three hydraulic systems powered by engine-driven and/or electric pumps
supply pressure to actuate the landing gear, wing flaps, wheel brakes,
nosewheel steering and fly-by-wire rudder and elevator. The standby pumps
are located in the wing root fairings for easy access.
   Bleed air is used for engine anti-ice, to inflate the deice boots on the
leading edges of the wings and empennage, and to supply the dual air-cycle
machines. Electric power is used for prop, probe and windshield anti-ice
heat. Rain removal is by windshield wipers.

PRICE AND VALUE
   The B/CA Comparison Profile compares the Saab 2000 to a composite
average that encompasses the Saab along with the de Havilland Dash 8-300,
Fokker 50EX and Canadair RJ. The named aircraft are all able to seat 50
people in airliner configuration. (The Dornier 328-110 was not included
because its cabin is smaller than other competitors'.)
The Saab 2000 scores well on the B/CA Comparison Profile, racking up
first-place or second-place scores in 16 of 24 categories, including the
price index in which it has a seven-percent advantage.
   The aircraft carries more payload, and it carries it a longer distance
than any competitor does. Clearly, it is the fastest 50-seat turboprop
certificated for civil use. No other aircraft in the $14-million price
range carries so many people, so far and so fast. Only the seven-passenger
Piaggio P180 Avanti, for example, is faster-and it is out of production.
   Although the Saab 2000 isn't as fast as a 30-seat Corporate RJ, nor does
it burn as little fuel during a 1,000-mile trip, it is at least $5-million
less expensive to buy than any jetliner of similar capacity.
   Also, the Saab 2000 is one of the quietest turboprops in production, but
passengers won't confuse it for a jetliner-at least not at present.
   The Saab 2000 Executive Shuttle offers the most advanced avionics suite
of any 36-seat corporate shuttle, provides highly automated systems for
reduced flightcrew workload, and brings the ability to operate out of
3,400-foot runways on typical 200-nm trips.
   Hot-and-high airport conditions impose few takeoff weight limitations on
the Saab 2000. It's the only aircraft in the Comparison Profile that can
depart from 5,000 feet on a 25C day at maximum takeoff weight.
   As scheduled airline service continues to atrophy (the result of less
profitable routes being abandoned), corporate-shuttle aircraft become more
attractive to dozens of companies with remote plants and subsidiaries. With
speed and interior sound levels approaching those of a jet, short field
performance that is competitive with other turboprops' and virtually
unrestricted hot-and-high performance, the Saab 2000 provides one of the
best alternatives to chartering an airliner full time.

FLYING IMPRESSIONS
   With the exception of its aircraft flight manual (AFM) and the
two-volume AOM, the Saab 2000 offers more ease-of-use features for pilots
than the competitive aircraft.
   These three tomes should be carried on the aircraft because of the
paucity of information provided by the AFM alone. The FAA-approved AFM, for
example, lacks step-by-step emergency procedures needed for continuing a
takeoff in the event of an engine failure just after V1. Those vital steps
are contained in the non-FAA-approved AOM.
   In our opinion, the checklist-as an extension of the AFM-is equally
incomplete with respect to procedures. The AOM provides both technical
description of the systems and amplified procedures needed for certain
emergency and abnormal conditions.
   No set of aircraft manuals that we can remember dilutes procedural
information over so many pages of text.
   Once strapped into the cockpit, though, pilots will find plenty of
well-thought-out automation to ease the workload. A clearance-delivery
feature, for example, powers the right radio-tuning unit and VHF com 2
transceiver from the center battery bus. Start the APU, and power is
automatically supplied to the avionics. The FMS provides the cabin-pressure
controller with the destination field elevation.
   However, the current production Collins FMS 4100 is limited. It stores
only two flight plans. There are no provisions for weight calculations and/
or fuel-flow predictions. The TSO C129 A2 GPS only is authorized for en
route and terminal operations.
   The APU supplies plenty of bleed air through the dual air-cycle machines
to quickly heat or cool the cabin. Our calculated V-speeds for a
41,000-pound takeoff weight, including full fuel and three passengers, were
116 knots for takeoff decision and rotation speeds, and 122 for the takeoff
safety speed-within two knots of the Vmc limited takeoff V-speeds. After
engine start, we quickly moved the condition levers from the ``start''
position (in which the 12.5-foot, six-blade props remain feathered) to the
770 rpm, ground idle ``run'' position. This was done to reduce buffeting
and vibration in the cabin.
   Our computed takeoff distance was 3,450 feet. After aligning the
aircraft on the runway, we pushed the takeoff/go-around mode annunciator
and then advanced the power levers to the detent. Engine response was
decidedly crisp, and the aircraft surged forward with an initial
acceleration that few civil aircraft can match.
   Pitch force with PECS was light and well balanced, but roll control was
heavy in comparison, significantly detracting from control harmony. Power
changes produced quite noticeable roll changes, requiring aileron inputs
and roll-trim changes.
   Our initial rate of climb was 2,500 fpm at 190 KIAS. We lowered the nose
for better forward visibility and accelerated to 240 KIAS. Twelve minutes
later, including pauses for ATC restrictions, we passed through FL 180 with
a climb rate of 1,700 fpm. Again because of ATC restrictions, our initial
cruise altitude was FL 250, which we reached in 13 minutes with a total
fuel burn of 980 pounds. We accelerated to 365 KTAS in ISA+6C conditions
with a fuel burn of 2,150 pph.
   Later, we were cleared to climb to FL 310, reaching it 19 minutes after
departure. Using 62-percent power, we accelerated to 370 KTAS while burning
2,040 pph in ISA+5C conditions. Total fuel burn for the climb was 1.390
pounds. At that point, we had to reduce power to avoid exceeding the 0.62
Mmo redline.
   Steep turns in the Saab 2000 bring out a little numbness in the PECS
pitch feel, but in normal maneuvering the fly-by-wire system has a natural,
proportionate feel. Recovery from clean and dirty stalls is aided by a
stick-pusher system. Holding the stick back after the stick pusher fires
results in a gentle left-wing roll off because of P-factor, even at flight
idle.
   Simulated OEI conditions bring out the Saab 2000's unique handling
characteristics. Directional control requires very little rudder pedal
input because of the rudder-by-wire system. Roll control through the manual
ailerons, though, requires more of an iron fist approach, especially at
slow speeds and high power settings. Once the aircraft accelerates to 160
KIAS or power is reduced, roll control forces become greatly reduced, and
they are easily counteracted with roll trim.
   Our computed landing distance, based on a 37,000-pound arrival weight,
was 3,700 feet with a 112- KIAS Vref, based on Vmo limits. The aerodynamic
Vref, based on 1.3 Vso speed, was 107 KIAS.
   Landing the aircraft requires some finesse because of its comparatively
stiff struts. After touchdown, we pulled the power levers back to flight
idle, then up and over into the ground-idle position. Pulling the levers
back farther against spring tension activates reverse thrust, which is
effective in slowing the aircraft on slippery surfaces.
   Our total fuel burn for the 1+07, 333-nm, great-circle-distance trip was
2,790 pounds.

ROLLS-ROYCE ALLISON AE2 100 ENGINES
   Few turboprop engines can match the dispatch reliability, fuel
efficiency and digital-control sophistication of the AE2100. The prop
gearbox, adapted from the venerable T56 engine that powers the U.S. Navy
Grumman E2C and P3C Orion, has a 30,000-hour mean time between repair. The
gas generator, shared with the AAS3007 turbofan, is sized for 6,000-shp
applications. As a result, the gas generator has a 125C temperature margin
for the AE2100C at its normal takeoff power rating of 3,770 shp.
   The 14-stage, axial flow compressor has variable inlet guide vanes and
five stages of variable stators that are controlled by the full-authority
digital engine control (FADEC). The rotor blades and stator vanes are
steel, for FOD resistance and low erosion.
   Downstream of the effusion-cooled, annular combustor are two
high-pressure turbine stages to drive the compressor, and two low-pressure
turbines that power the prop gear box. The engine's modular construction
eases maintenance chores, and most routine inspections can be done with a
conventional tool box.
   The FADECs not only control all the gas generator functions, but they
also are linked to the prop-control units, enabling the engine to be fitted
with single-power-lever controls. On the ground or in flight, the FADECs
keep the props virtually in perfect synchronization, even during prop speed
transitions.
   Five annunciator buttons select the appropriate rpm and power ranges for
various phases of flight: takeoff/go-around, max continuous power, climb,
cruise and flex power. The latter mode allows the use of reduced- power
takeoffs that lower thermal stress on the engine, and result in a more
comfortable acceleration rate for the passengers.

SAAB 2000 AVIONICS
   The Saab 2000 has the most sophisticated avionics system ever installed
in a turboprop regional aircraft, not only because of its power, but also
due to the way it ties into so many other aircraft systems.
   Six, 7.25-inch Collins Pro Line 4 EFIS tubes occupy most of the Saab
2000's instrument panel, including primary and secondary EICAS screens
inboard of the left- and right-side primary flight and navigation displays.
The amount of information that can be displayed almost seems more than
what's needed-and that's intentional. If one tube should fail, the aircraft
can be dispatched with the five remaining displays, providing that the
display can be moved to one of the center EICAS positions.
   The panel layout enhances hand-eye coordination. Directly above the
displays is a central, flight-guidance control panel, flanked by left- and
right-side radio-tuning units and display controllers. EFIS reversion
switches are located on the overhead panel.
   A Collins Integrated Avionics Processing System (IAPS) forms the hub of
the well-proven, hub-and-spoke, ARINC 429-linked Pro Line 4. Left- and
right-side data concentrator units (DCUs) receive inputs from analog and
digital engine and systems sensors, translate the data into ARINC 429 and
forward it to the IAPS for processing and display on the EICAS.
   Both DCUs are required for dispatch, and there is no provision for a
third, onboard spare.
   The Collins FMS 4100 flight management systems are optional. In our
opinion, these boxes offer less power and fewer features than competitive
FMS units and newer Collins designs.
   This year, the avionics system will be upgraded to Version 6.0. The FMS
will be improved, HUD will be added as an option, and enhanced GPS sensors
will be installed.

Illustration: Graph: B/CA Comparison Profile
*Saab 2000 at high-speed cruise, competitors at long-range cruise.
   Designers attempt to give aircraft exceptional capabilities in all
areas-including price-but the laws of physics do not allow one aircraft to
do all missions with equal efficiency. Tradeoffs are a reality of aircraft
design.
   In order to obtain a feeling for the strengths and compromises of a
particular aircraft, B/CA compares the subject aircraft's performance to
the composite characteristics of aircraft in its class. We average
parameters of interest for the aircraft that are most likely to be
considered as competitive with the subject of our analysis, and then we
compute the percentage differences between the parameters of the subject
aircraft and the composite numbers for the competitive group as a whole.
Those differences are presented in bar-graph form, and the absolute value
of the parameter under consideration, along with its rank with respect to
the composite, are given.
   For this Comparison Profile, we present selected parameters of the Saab
2000 in relation to a competitive group consisting of the Canadair
Corporate Jetliner, the de Havilland Corporate Dash 8-300 and the Fokker
Executive F50. It should be understood that this Comparison Profile is
meant to illustrate relative strengths and compromises of the subject
aircraft; it is not a means of comparing specific aircraft to each other.

Illustration: Graph: Time and Fuel Versus Distance. Time and Fuel Versus 
Distance-This graph shows the plot of two missions: the first flown at
maximum-speed cruise and the second at long-range cruise. The numbers at
the hour lines indicate cumulative miles and fuel burned for each of the
two profiles. The intermediate points on these lines are accurate only for
the full trip; however, they can provide the user with a rough idea of the
time and fuel required for trips of intermediate length. For example, the
Saab 2000 can carry a 7,200-pound payload, representative of 36 passengers,
more than 1,200 miles at high-speed cruise. Flying at an average long-range
cruise speed of 289 KTAS results in a range of about 1,600 miles with the
same payload.

Illustration: Graph: Specific Range. Specific Range-The specific range of
an aircraft, the ratio of nautical miles flown to pounds of fuel burned
(nm/lb), is a measure of its fuel efficiency. This graph shows specific
range values at three altitudes at a mid-range cruise weight of 44,000
pounds. For example, the Saab 2000 cruising at 360 KTAS at FL 310 at this
weight achieves an SFC of 0.19 nm/lb. Note how pronounced the SFC curve is
from long-range cruise to high-speed cruise at each of the three charted
altitudes.

Illustration: Graph: Range/Payload Profile. Range/Payload Profile-The
purpose of this graph is to provide rough simulations of trips under a
variety of payload and airport density altitude conditions, with the goal
of flying the longest distance. For the Saab 2000, we have used high-speed
cruise instead of long-range cruise for all weights. The payload lines,
which are intended for gross simulation purposes only, are each generated
from end points. Time and fuel burns, shown at the top of the chart, are
plotted for individual one-, two- and three-hour missions published in the
aircraft operating manual. For example, the Saab 2000 can carry a
7,200-pound payload (36 passengers) more than 1,200 nm without
departure-airport density altitude limitations. Remember, the runway
distances are based on the 100-percent normal takeoff power of 3,770 shp
and flaps 15-not the reduced flex power setting of 91 percent used for the
specifications box.

Photograph: The Saab 2000's lineage is immediately apparent. The nose
retains the Model 340's lines, and the fuselage, although 24 feet longer,
has the same cross-section as the 340. The wing also is a scaled version of
the 340's. The propulsion package, including a composite Dowty propeller,
is all new.

Photograph: Saab has been demonstrating a 2000 with a corporate
configuration featuring 36 seats. The aircraft has two forward club
sections that seat six passengers each, and 24 passenger seats with a
34-inch seat pitch. The forward section of the cabin includes two garment
closets and generous storage lockers for carryon bags. The galley and
storage occupy the aft-most portion of the cabin.

Photograph: The Saab 2000 carries 9,370 pounds of fuel in wet-wing fuel
tanks. Single-point pressure refueling allows the aircraft to take on a
full load of fuel in about 15 minutes.

NO BUSMAN'S HOLIDAY, THIS
The Washington merry-go-round continues to dilute confidence in the people
who run our country.

By:
Torch Lewis

   At this juncture, the government has just reopened, having been shut
down for nearly a week and affecting 800,000 workers who labor for Uncle
Sam. The irony of the situation is that all these folks will be paid for
their enforced vacation, so they might just as well have stayed on the
job.
   Part of the blame can be affixed on House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Returning aboard Air Force One from the funeral services for Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, he was relegated to the coach section and enjoined
not to use the forward lav.
20 His Speakership took extraordinary umbrage at this presidential snub,
and vented his political petulance in the Halls of Congress by being an
obstacle to progress. He slowed the settlement of the stalemate of
budgetary differences between the Republicans and Democrats, a.k.a. Dole
versus Clinton.
20 The pundits who cover and chafe at the Washington scene called it a
draw. Madam Rivkin, who is in charge of our moneybags, hinted that it might
have been necessary to shut down our ATC system. Of course, this was merely
sabre rattling. But one thing she did is a puzzlement. In order to keep
certain vital functions of the government running, she transferred $62
billion from the Civil Service retirement fund to the OMB.
20 Not only is it astonishing that one person or department possesses
such fiscal clout, but I was under the false impression that retirement
funds-especially government ones-were sacrosanct. It also beggars the
question as to whence cometh the funds to send $12 billion to Mexico. (This
extrapolates out to $500 for every citizen in the U.S.A.)
   Hersch, what do you think of our chances of being repaid for this
``loan''? Perhaps about as good as getting repaid the dough we were owed
from World War I?
Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the government goslings are flapping their
galluses over what to do about the FAA. The only area of agreement is that
something needs to be done about it. Republican Senator John McCain's
addled overview is that reformation is the answer. Among his convoluted
proposals is a special tax on business jets and an easement on airline
fees.
20 In my humble opinion, the most sensible reform is to make the FAA an
independent agency, headed by a strong leader with extended tenure,
supported by a knowledgeable committee that would receive director fees for
monthly meetings rather than full-time employment. This would attract some
real talent. Most of this proposal is embodied in HR 2276, which was before
the House at press time.
20 Spearheading the opposition, nach, is Secretary Federico Pea, whose
power will be heavily diminished by loss of authority over the 50,000 souls
overseeing the governance of the FAA.
20 As an independent agency, the FAA could function vastly more
efficiently to update equipment and modus operandi. The present air traffic
controllers should be awarded medals for their exceptional handling of
heavy traffic with some equipment older than my dog tags. Recent failures
of equipment in Oakland, Chicago and New York breed only contempt for the
present arduous process of equipment replacement. Little consolation can be
drawn from the fact that no two aircraft have come together as a result of
these dreadful and completely unnecessary outages. Pilot skills, pilot
skills.

WIND SHEAR CAN KILL
   A few weeks back, a good friend-who is a Learjet owner and an avid
golfer-underwent serious shoulder surgery; his second. The cause of this
discomfiture was the result of a Mohawk Airlines crash at Rochester, New
York in July 1963. The Mohawk 404 took off in the teeth of a severe
thunderstorm and, as it lifted off, it encountered wind shear and crashed.
I believe the fatalities were the pilot and two others, with injuries to
almost all passengers.
20 My friend suffered a severe broken shoulder and other injuries. The
paraphernalia installed in his shoulder permitted him to resume golf a year
or two later. The pins and whatnot finally failed, occasioning the
subsequent surgery.
20 Now comes the good news: Several avionics manufacturers have
certificated-or will soon certificate-airborne wind-shear detecting radar.
It took only 32 measly years to come up with this equipment. I do not fault
the avionics manufacturers for the delay because it has been the FAA's
responsibility to research the problem.
20 It is outrageous, in my view, that it took a full generation to
develop this vital equipment, especially since we have had airborne radar
for over 40 years.

WHO SHOULD SEE YOUR TRAINING RECORD?
Government must proceed with caution as it explores wider access to
pilot-training records.

By:
David Collogan

   Recently, B/CA urged the FAA to look favorably upon an expected NTSB
recommendation seeking to assure the free exchange of training and
competency information involving applicants for pilot positions.
   The NTSB's intent is rational: to prevent air carriers from passing
along inept pilots from company to company. But, the implementation of such
a rule is fraught with potential mischief.
   Conceptually, the issue should simply be that of protecting the air
carriers from civil suit when they pass on unflattering, but safety-related
training information. However, the NTSB recommendation, in its final form,
seems to avoid simplicity in favor of building another bureaucracy.
   The Safety Board proposes that airlines and private training companies 
be required to collect and provide the FAA with a paperwork mountain of
information on how pilots perform during training. Specifically, the NTSB
said those private enterprise businesses should ``maintain pertinent
standardized information on the quality of pilot performance in activities
that assess skills, abilities, knowledge and judgment during training,
check flights, initial operating experience and line checks.''
   The NTSB also wants the FAA to require airlines and training firms ``to
provide the FAA, for incorporation into a storage and retrieval system,
pertinent standardized information'' on those same pilot performance
parameters, which airlines should use for ``evaluating applicants for pilot
positions . . .'' These recommendations fail the smell test at every step:
   -- While private businesses must keep detailed training records for
their own purposes, they should not be responsible for collecting such
information for the federal government.
   -- The mere existence of such a federal database has terrible potential
for misuse.
   -- A cost/benefit analysis would show that such a record-keeping system
would cost millions of dollars and provide few, if any, safety benefits.
   -- Adoption of this element in the Board's suggestions would subject
airlines and training companies to never-ending lawsuits and focus their
attention on the legalities of record-keeping instead of the quality of
their training programs.
   It's important that you should know the background in case you missed it
in our December 1995 issue (Viewpoint, page 3). This all resulted from the
Safety Board's investigations into several recent pilot-error accidents,
the latest of which was the AMR Eagle/Flagship Airlines Jetstream crash in
North Carolina 13 months ago-the same accident that spawned the so-called
``one level of safety'' rule the FAA issued in December 1995.
   The NTSB blamed the accident on the pilot-in-command's incorrectly
assuming the Jetstream's engine had failed. (The No. 1 engine ignition
light illuminated, but the Board found no evidence of engine failure.)
Further, the Board noted the pilot's subsequent failure to follow approved
procedures for engine failure, go-around, and stall recovery.
   Also cited ``was the failure of AMR Eagle/Flagship management to
identify, document, monitor and remedy deficiencies in pilot performance
and training.''
What does any of this have to do with creating a database of pilot-training
records? Even though the pilot had been working for Flagship for four
years, the NTSB raised the issue of the pilot's less-than-exemplary record
at Comair, his previous employer.
   The Board said Flagship had not requested the pilot's records from
Comair when he was hired, nor was it Comair's policy to release such
records even if they had been requested. The NTSB believes some of the
pilot shortcomings might have been traceable back to his performance at
Comair.
   Air Line Pilots Association President Randolph Babbitt was sharply
critical of the NTSB's proposals, observing that after four years at
Flagship, any performance problems the pilot might have had when hired
should ``have been a known quantity [before the accident occurred] if the
qualification program were effective.''
   The ALPA president noted that training records and programs are not
uniform from carrier to carrier. Pilots also do not have the opportunity
``to comment on or rebut a particular notation,'' many of which are very
subjective, Babbitt said.
   The FAA said it recognizes the importance of pilot-training records, but
added, ``There are privacy issues that must be addressed. The FAA is
prepared to work with Congress, the NTSB and the aviation industry to
resolve these issues.''
   A dialogue between those groups may reveal ways to enhance safety by
providing limited access to pilot- training records, but any feasible plan
will stop far short of the NTSB's expensive and overreaching database
scheme.

COMMENT DEADLINE ON CERTIFICATION NPRM IS PUSHED BACK

   Persons and organizations who want to comment on a broad revision of
airman and training certification rules still can do so. Just days before
December 11, 1995, when the comment period was originally scheduled to
expire, the FAA responded to requests for more time and extended the
deadline until February 13. The proposal contains significant changes
regarding the certification of pilots, instructors and training
establishments (B/CA, November 1995, page 32).

SMALL COMMUTER AIRLINES BRACE FOR UPGRADED REQUIREMENTS

   On December 14, 1995, FAR Part 135 commuter airlines operating turbine
aircraft with 10 to 30 passenger seats got their first look at the new
rule-NPRM 95-5-that requires them to comply with the same regulations that
cover Part 121 carriers. Formerly, Part 121 extended only to scheduled
flights of aircraft with 31 or more passenger seats. The Regional Airline
Association expected the final rule to contain most of the elements of the
original proposal, and said it did not object to most of the proposal's
contents. In a related move, the FAA published its NPRM to revise duty
times and rest periods for airline pilots.

PERIODIC REVIEW OF REGULATIONS IS PROPOSED

   If the FAA adopts a notice of proposed rulemaking calling for
comprehensive regulatory reviews, the agency will conduct them beginning in
January 1997, and every three years thereafter. The review process will
allow for industry comment on what the public believes to be burdensome
FARs that should be amended or dropped. As with a similar 1994 review, the
FAA proposes to limit commenters to the three issues they consider most
urgent (B/CA, March 1994, page 15).

PROBE CONTINUES INTO CRASH THAT KILLED JEPPESEN OFFICIAL

   NTSB investigators are still trying to determine the probable cause of
the November 19, 1995 crash of a Beech Baron transporting three Jeppesen
executives and two other people. The aircraft plunged into Lake Erie after
takeoff from Cleveland's Lakefront Airport. Killed in the accident was the
pilot and owner of the aircraft, Milford Derrick, who was director of
Jeppesen's Aviation Training Technologies unit. Jeppesen officials John
White and Dale Sherman were injured in the crash. Two other passengers were
listed as still missing at press time.

BOMBARDIER OPENS TRAINING CENTER IN MONTREAL

   Factory-approved pilot and mechanic training for the Canadair Regional
Jet and the recently certificated Challenger 604 business jet will be
conducted at a new Bombardier facility in Montreal, Quebec. Initially, the
facility will house two FAA Level D Regional Jet simulators and one Level D
Challenger 604 simulator-all three provided by Quebec-based CAE
Electronics. Additional space is available for a fourth simulator, possibly
for the Global Express. In addition, the new facility houses a joint
Bombardier/CAE research and development center.

CERTIFICATION OF CITATION X SLIPS TO APRIL

   Efforts to increase the maximum takeoff weight of the Citation X to
about 800 pounds to permit a full-fuel payload of 1,400 pounds (seven
passengers) is forcing another delay in the FAA certification schedule-this
time to April. The new business jet originally was slated to receive
certification in August 1995, but in June 1995, Cessna revised the date to
November 1995 (B/CA, April 1995, page 18). Cessna has been trying to
achieve a balance between reducing Citation X cabin noise and minimizing
the extra weight of sound-dampening materials.

director Jim Wood resigned from their positions, effective December 31,
1995, after the Dayton, Ohio trade show's board of directors elected to
outsource the trade show and scale back its support of the event. According

   The ATC system in the United Kingdom will be removed as an integral part
of the Civil Aeronautics Authority, but it will not become a non-government
agency, as is the fate for Canada's ATC system (B/CA, June 1995, page 34).
Instead, the ATC system in England will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
the CAA. Detailed proposals for establishing the subsidiary organization in
April were under development at press time. Separately, the 24-hour
aircraft accident/incident reporting phone number in the United Kingdom has
been changed to +01 252-512299.

BE ALERT TO ATC DISRUPTIONS IN ICELAND AND NEW ZEALAND

   Controller job actions threatened ATC disruptions in Iceland and New
Zealand at press time. Up to 90 percent of the controller work force in
Iceland threatened to resign effective January 1. The cause is allegedly
the Iceland government's refusal to recruit sufficient controllers to cope
with increasing air traffic demand over the North Atlantic and Polar
regions, leading to excessive overtime. Meanwhile, controllers in New
Zealand's privatized ATC system are seeking a pay increase and have planned
a series of strikes during high-traffic periods.

IMPROVEMENTS ON TAP FOR ATC OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO

   U.S. ATC is expected to start clearing more flights over the Gulf of
Mexico if initial enhancements to increase the range of VHF communications
become operational as scheduled, in December. ATC currently restricts the
number of flights in the Gulf region due to the limited range of VHF radio
services. The FAA will equip six strategically placed buoys with
satellite-communications capability to extend VHF range, which should allow
ATC to handle more flights.

NTSB URGES THE FAA TO PERMIT SINGLE-ENGINE IFR IN ALASKA

   FAA is reviewing an NTSB recommendation to permit turbine-powered,
single-engine aircraft to provide revenue passenger service under IFR in
Alaska. The recommendation is one of 23 issued as part of an NTSB study of
aviation safety in Alaska. Proponents of allowing commercial-passenger
operations under IFR in single-engine turbine aircraft are hoping the
NTSB's position may spur the FAA to propose a rule allowing such operations
throughout the United States. Canada eased single-engine IFR operations
early in 1993 (B/CA, July 1995, page 11).

UNLEADED AVGAS WILL NOT SPARK FIRST BATCH OF CESSNA SINGLES

   Cessna's initial batch of new 172s and 182s, scheduled to get under
construction later this year, will not be designed to burn unleaded avgas.
The company said the American Society of Testing Materials' (ASTM) delay in
approving the specification for the new fuel forced the decision (B/CA,
June 1995, page 24). Phillips Petroleum, which could produce 82UL avgas,
says ASTM approval is still several months off. In the meantime, Cessna
says it has not abandoned its long-term plans to build aircraft that can
use unleaded avgas.

among the companies extending price freezes on the purchase of replacement
parts through this year. For the second year in a row, Bell will not
increase prices for spare parts. In 1994, Bell raised spare parts prices an
average of less than 1.5 percent over 1993. In addition, Bell reduced the
prices on over 5,800 parts in 1995. Meanwhile, Honeywell is holding the
price of spares at June 1993 levels.

   At press time, the FAA gave no indication of when it would re-impose a
rule requiring that transponders installed in transport-category aircraft
after a certain date be capable of replying to Mode S interrogations.
Nearly four years ago, the FAA rescinded such a requirement saying that
Mode S ground sensors are not expected to be fully operational until late
1995 and, therefore, it ``will not require Mode S transponders before that
time'' (B/CA, July 1992, page 17).

Wheeling-Ohio County (HLG), Shreveport Downtown (DTN), Monroe County (BMG),
Delaware County (MIE), Lake Tahoe (TVL), Greenbriar Valley (LWB) and Cape
Girardeau (CGI). The agency said it will work with the airport authorities

ASIAN AEROSPACE `96 - SINGAPORE AIR SHOW

By:
J.M.


   The Asia/Pacific market is proving slower to develop than one might
think, but a good place to gauge its aspirations and take its pulse is
Asian Aerospace, the region's premier, biennial aviation trade show. This
year's event is being held at Singapore's Changi Airport on February 6-11.
   While other shows in the region focus on their local niches, Asian
Aerospace `96 is the big umbrella for the Asia/Pacific region as a whole.
And it's where the CEOs turn up en masse.
   Like other shows of its kind held recently, the Singapore air show is
shaping up to be bigger and better than ever. Participating companies are
up from 935 to 950, and from 34 countries as opposed to 31 two years ago.
Corporate chalets-so important for hobnobbing with customers and signing
deals-are up to 126 from 116. (To judge the growth of the show, compare
that with a mere 30 chalets as recently as 1988).
   The number of aircraft on display, however, will remain at around 70,
because of the immutable restrictions on outdoor space imposed by the
Changi Airport authorities. What will be interesting, though, will be the
proportion of business aircraft in the static park.
   Among them is bound to be a Singapore Airlines Learjet 31, one of six
operated by the airline for pilot training. The airline recently placed a
repeat order, and is slated to take four new Learjet 45s in the fourth
quarter of 1997, with options on another two. Learjet recently delivered a
Model 60 to Malaysia for airways inspection and calibration, and will have
a representative aircraft on show.
   The Citation X is slated to make its first Singapore appearance, as is
Bombardier's Global Express mockup. Gulfstream is unlikely to take the G-V
test aircraft that far that soon, settling instead for a G-IVSP on display.
Raytheon will be present with a Hawker 800 and Beechjet 400A, and Canadair
with a Challenger. Fairchild is making a first-time appearance as it senses
some demand for its 19- to 20-passenger Metroliner in the region, and Saab
will be playing up its larger 50-passenger Saab 2000. In that category, the
Canadair Regional Jet also will be on exhibit.
   Jet Aviation International, a corporate aircraft charter and management
company, is exhibiting for the first time, in support of its new Singapore
operations. Indeed, many of the developments in business aviation are
happening outside the show. Among them: Zimex recently opened a
business-aircraft maintenance/charter operation; Gulfstream has set up a
regional parts depot with $1.5 million worth of spares; and AlliedSignal
and Aviall have set up or beefed up their support for corporate-aviation
customers in the region.
   Back at the show, an undisputed highlight will be Bell Helicopter's
public unveiling of both the new Model 407 light single helicopter and
Model 430 intermediate twin helicopter, both of which will have just
received U.S. certification.

SUN-DEVIL-AREA FBOS MAKE SUPER BOWL PLANS

By:
L.M./G.A.G.

   Several Phoenix-area FBOs are making some special arrangements to
welcome pilots headed west with their passengers to the Super Bowl, on
January 28, at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona.
   At Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, all of the FBOs will be
extending some extra hospitality. The FBO managers with whom we spoke said
they have blocked hotel rooms, but urge all comers to claim them fast.
Hotel rooms are scarce-not only due to the Super Bowl, but because of the
Phoenix Open Golf Tournament taking place simultaneously. Travelers who are
late with their hotel bookings may have to shuttle to the game from
lodgings in Las Vegas or Tucson.
   Angelo Tedeschi, Cutter Aviation's general manager, says his facility
will have buffet-style refreshments, a large-screen television and
helicopter shuttles to and from the game. Super Bowl paraphernalia will be
for sale in the lobby. He's had rooms blocked for two years. GTA Aviation
Services and Sawyer Aviation also will offer food and big-screen TVs. In
addition, GTA will be auctioning off a Super Bowl ticket. At the city-run
Lincoln J. Ragsdale Executive Terminal, a 40-foot-by-60-foot hospitality
tent will be set up on the apron area just east of the terminal. The tent
will be equipped with a large-screen TV, tables, chairs (and heaters, if
necessary). Ballpark-theme food and beverages will be served.
   At Phoenix-Deer Valley Municipal Airport, General Manager Ron Haarer
says his facility is making rooms available. ``We have a flight academy and
will use some of the apartments,'' he explained. A big-screen TV will be
set up. Jet A will be selling for $1.67 per gallon using a credit card;
100LL for $1.73 using a credit card.
   The one FBO at Williams Gateway Airport-DynAir Fueling-is decking out
its lounge area with refreshments, a large-screen TV, a pool table and
movies on videocassette for those who don't want to watch the game. There
will be helicopter shuttles to and from the game site, and discount fuel
rates for the duration.
   At Scottsdale Airport, two FBOs are making a special hospitality effort.
Desert Aviation (formerly Aero Services) is assisting with room
accommodations and transportation. A big-screen TV and refreshments will be
awaiting the arrivals. Les Horrell, president, said that staff will help
pilots plot what to ``see and do'' while in the area. Russ Allen, director
of aviation services for Corporate Jets, says a reception cosponsored by
Learjet and AlliedSignal will greet the facility's guests. ``One hangar
will be decorated in a Super Bowl motif, and we will have catered food and
a large-screen TV,'' he noted. Also available will be 60 crew cars and a
few remaining blocked hotel rooms.
   From January 24-29, special arrival and departure procedures will be in
place at the following airports: Sky Harbor, Scottsdale, Deer Valley,
Falcon Field and Goodyear Municipal.
   A slot time (with a 30-minute window) will be required for all general
aviation IFR arrivals and departures. Beginning at 0600 hours to midnight
on January 22, pilots can call the Albuquerque traffic-management unit
(TMU) to request an arrival slot time and reservation number. Calls for a
departure slot can be made starting January 26. The toll-free number is
(800) 879-4435.
   Reservations can only be made 48 hours in advance of the estimated time
of arrival or departure. Pilots should be ready to provide the TMU with
departure and destination identifiers, and proposed UTC arrival/departure
time. The TMU will provide a time and reservation code that must be
included in the remarks section of the flight plan. Pilots must arrive no
more than five minutes before and no later than 10 minutes after their slot
time and depart in the block time allocated. Users not complying with these
times could face extensive delays.
   Except for emergencies, air-filed IFR flight plans, changes in
destination or aircraft without coded slot approvals will not be accepted
by ATC to land at the five program airports.
   The FAA warns that VFR aircraft desiring to land at Sky Harbor may
experience delays of more than 30 minutes. Pilots in VFR aircraft should
contact Phoenix Approach no later than 20 nm from Sky Harbor for delay and
Class B airspace clearance information.
   Overflight traffic not landing in the Phoenix areas should avoid
transiting within a 30-nm radius of Sky Harbor at and below 10,000 feet
msl.
   For more information, see the NOTAM issued on or about December 7.

A WAKE-UP CALL ON FATIGUE

By:
R.B.P.

   The NTSB has put out a wake-up call for managers and their line pilots
to start paying attention to the safety implications of crew fatigue.
   To spread the alarm, the Safety Board sponsored an international
conference in November 1995 to help determine the extent to which fatigue
contributes to transportation accidents, and to reveal some of the
countermeasures that can be used to avoid fatigue-related accidents. The
conference attracted more than 500 attendees from around the world.
   One NTSB member confided that although formal aviation-accident
investigations might not be able to identify fatigue as a frequent
contributing factor, he was convinced that about half of all
general-aviation accidents are fatigue related.
   David Dinges, M.D., from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School
in Philadelphia, discussed the vast amount of research that had been done
to uncover the characteristics of hazardous fatigue. Mark R. Rosekind, of
the NASA Fatigue Countermeasures Program in Moffett Field, California,
discussed a variety of steps that can be taken to avoid the often
devastating results of severe fatigue.
   The eye-opening message of the presentations was that an enormous
reservoir of information establishes irrefutably that no one is immune to
fatigue. Guest speakers made it clear that the effects of fatigue could be
heightened by a number of contributory conditions, including the lack of
proper nutrition and the impact of emotional disturbances. Rosekind and Dr.
Dinges also emphasized that while judicious use of caffeine might provide
some short-term beneficial effect in overcoming fatigue, the body soon
develops resistance to its awakening jolt.
   According to researchers, testing in recent years clearly has documented
the deleterious effects of fatigue on performing complicated tasks as well
as on judgment.
   Presenters conveyed examples of transportation accidents in which flawed
judgment resulting from fatigue was found to be causal. Examples cited were
the Exxon Valdez grounding and an aircraft accident at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba
in 1993 in which the crew had been on duty for 18 hours and had flown for
approximately nine hours.
   Rosekind's research into fatigue countermeasures shows that a number of
techniques can be used to reduce or stave off the most serious fatigue
episodes. Brief supervised naps, although not presently authorized in most
aircraft operations, often refresh long-duty crewmembers. Bright lights and
animated conversations in the cockpit, too, sometimes help (but that
suggestion can butt up against the sterile cockpit theory).
   Researchers agree that in aviation, pilots and managers must be well
informed in order to understand the complexity of forcing the body clock to
work in accordance with the demands of modern business. Ultimately, the
physical toll will demand the modification of rules that allow unrealistic
expectations to be made of individuals.
   At present, few pilots receive any training or information on how to
avoid fatigue.What's more, many career aviators still believe they are
immune to its hazardous effects.
   In coming months, the FAA may revise rules and recommendations regarding
duty and flight times for pilots. Meanwhile, managers and line pilots can
study and consider the scientific information on fatigue.

SUPERIOR TURBINE: PMA AT ITS BEST

By:
G.A.G.


   Concern over replacement parts has long been a part of aviation,
particularly when the source of those parts has been other than the
OEM-such as independent parts distributors, repair stations or Parts
Manufacturer Approval (PMA) companies.
   Indeed, concern particularly over bogus replacement parts issues in the
airline industry (not any actual increase in the number of incidents)
reached a crescendo when the FAA disclosed plans to tighten up rules and
procedures for the manufacturing, distributing and disposal of replacement
parts.
   Few incidents of alleged wrongdoing by independent parts distributors
and repair stations have been reported. And, the vast majority of PMA
companies dealing with general-aviation parts are not only legitimate, but
also can offer some significant advantages over OEM-provided parts.
   Dallas-based Superior Turbine is an example of a PMA company at its
best. Superior Turbine was founded in 1992 to manufacture parts for the
Allison 250 series engines. The company is a division of Superior Air
Parts, established in 1967 and now one of the largest suppliers of parts
for Continental and Lycoming piston engines. In 1995, Superior Turbine
started operating out of a new Dallas-based facility.
   Good PMA companies claim they offer these four primary advantages over
OEMs: lower prices, speedier delivery, expanded warranties and better
quality. For instance, Superior says it sells Allison parts at 25 percent
below Allison Engine's list prices. Of course, once after-market parts
suppliers begin competing with OEMs, most original manufacturers drop their
prices to meet the competition. In addition, many PMA firms, like Superior,
ship parts much faster than the typical OEM. OEMs' shipments can take up to
90 days because replacement parts are only a small portion of many OEM
businesses.
   As competitors with OEMs, Superior and other PMA firms strive to provide
parts of higher quality than the original ones they are replacing. For
example, Superior entered the turbine-engine-parts business with its ST-250
package, consisting of Superior-developed and certificated hot-section and
overhaul replacement parts for Allison 250s.
   Because Superior feels its parts are of a higher quality than originals,
the company covers its products with a materials and workmanship warranty
that is often longer than the OEM's: two years or 1,000 hours of engine
operation. A prorated warranty is in effect in the third year.
   However, even the best of PMA firms are not infallible. When most
suppliers were out of a certain Lycoming engine rod bolt, Superior found a
dealer that had some surplus bolts. Since they were presented as genuine
Lycoming bolts, and since an inspection of the first batch revealed they
were acceptable, Superior ordered 3,000 bolts and began to sell them to
engine shops.
   Superior later discovered that some bolts in the last batch didn't meet
spec, and the company immediately drafted a service bulletin and urged the
FAA to issue an AD. In addition, the company used its parts-tracking system
to identify and contact all customers who bought the suspect bolts.
   One engine failure was traced to the bolts, and although Superior didn't
manufacture the defective bolts, it offered to pay for labor, new bolts and
other related parts.
   Operators will find that the best of the PMA firms provide that kind of
customer support, in addition to being a provider of high-quality parts.

SPLITTING AIRS

By:
P.E.B.

   A recent NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System report provides a good
reminder (as though you'd forgotten) that the FAA sometimes splits hairs
when defining operating procedures.
   A VFR pilot called approach control prior to entering Class B airspace.
The controller responded with the aircraft's call sign, transponder code
and a request for an ident, with which the pilot complied.
   The airman continued his flight and penetrated the Class B boundary.
About a minute later, the controller said, ``I guess a clearance means
nothing, but you are cleared into the Class B airspace,'' the pilot related
in his ASRS account.
   The pilot had assumed-wrongly-that giving him a code implied clearance.
Not so, says the FAA, which says look at the FARs and the Aeronautical
Information Manual. FAR Part 91.131 and the AIM stipulate that a pilot must
be specifically cleared to enter Class B airspace.
   However, had the pilot been approaching Class C or Class D airspace, he
would have been perfectly legal. The standard in those instances requires
simply establishing two-way radio communication. In other words, as long as
a controller answers a call using the aircraft call sign (even to ask a
pilot to stand by), then two-way communication has been established, and
the pilot is free to enter Class C or D airspace-unless specifically asked
to remain clear.
   Another split hair: If the controller responds to a call, but does not
use your call sign, two-way communica-tion has not been established,
according to the AIM and ATC controllers' handbook. For instance, if your
call is answered with, ``Aircraft calling,
stand by,'' you have to stay clear of Class C and D airspace as well as
Class B.

BOOK REVIEW: AVIATION MANAGEMENT, CASTRO STYLE

By:
P.E.B.

   In his preface to Corporate Aviation Management, author Raoul Castro
sets an ambitious goal: to write a ``practical guide for the executive in
charge of the aviation department, the aviation department manager or chief
pilot, aspirants to aviation management positions, and teachers and
students of aviation management.''
   What results is a 349-page text that is a soup-to-nuts guide for
corporate aviation management. Because it sets out to do so much, the text
is best used as an overview, and is likely to appeal more to those people
studying business aviation or interested in rising through the ranks in
corporate flight departments than to current managers.
   The book is organized into four parts: an overview of corporate aviation
and basic management principles, a discussion of flight-department
economics, a section Castro calls the ``Seven Key Factors,'' and a brief
section that attempts to predict the future of corporate aviation.
   The crux of the book is delivered in the second and third sections.
Within the economics section is a chapter on how to assess the costs and
benefits of aircraft operations. Castro delves deeply into justification
issues, providing useful real-world examples of how to compare the use of
business jets to other modes of transportation, and how to translate the
time business jets save into money that can offset the cost of aircraft
operation.
   Section three breaks down corporate aviation into three departments and
four operational objectives, which combine to form Castro's ``Seven Key
Factors.'' The departments are: flight, maintenance, and schedule and
passenger service. The operational objectives are: safety, security,
emergency planning and training. It is this section that touches-sometimes
too briefly-on virtually every facet of corporate-aircraft operations.
   The author's writing style is sometimes choppy, but at the same time,
the book is easy to understand and a quick read. Castro, who currently
works as an aviation consultant, has held (since 1947) positions too
numerous to mention in corporate aviation, including 17 years as manager of
Marcor's multi-aircraft flight department.
   Corporate Aviation Management is published by the Southern Illinois
University Press and is available for $34.95, plus $3 postage and handling.
To order, call SIU at (800) 346-2680.

CRM-THE AMPLIFIED FORM

By:
L.M.

   A Stow, Massachusetts-based company-Cockpit Management Resources
(CMR)-takes crew resource management (CRM) a step beyond the one-seminar
approach. The company, established in 1979, contracts with corporations to
give individualized, year-long training-correspondence-course style-to
pilots.
   ``We don't believe you can change behavior in a short workshop,'' said
Bob Mudge, who is a co-president and founder of CMR, along with his son,
Gordon.
   The elder Mudge is a former pilot with Delta Airlines, and previously
Northeastern Airlines, while his son is a general aviation pilot. According
to Bob Mudge, the company's interaction with each pilot amounts to
approximately 18 to 24 hours per year. ``Our approach to CRM differs from
traditional CRM in that it is objective, not subjective.'' And it is
private, between each pilot and CMR.
   Pilots enrolled in the program receive one study unit per month for 12
months. The units include written material for the student to study, plus
audiotapes of pilot, copilot and check pilot scenarios. Once students feel
they have mastered the material, they must complete essay questions or
multiple-choice questions and mail the answers back to CMR for feedback and
critique.
   The company has coined its approach to CRM as the Quantum-Pro Management
System. To CMR, Cockpit Resource Management is a systematic, ``not just
psychological or operational training method.'' CMR emphasizes the
debriefing-tracing errors back to their cause ``so crewmembers can avoid
them in future flights,'' said Mudge. ``What we're after is significant,
measurable improvement in flightcrew performance that lasts over time.''
   Kevin Lynch, a pilot for a Fortune 50 company on the West Coast and
program coordinator in his flight department for Quantum-Pro said, ``What
helped us most is the debrief, going over the strengths and weaknesses of a
flight. The program also defined a common set of tools that everyone in the
flight department can use to make communication happen.'' Lynch said the
CMR program introduces standard management procedures that the pilots can
implement without question, just like standard operating procedures.
   Mudge says the goal of CMR's Quantum-Pro system is a quality-controlled
flight department that performs with increased safety, fewer regulatory
violations, improved customer service, lower training expenses, higher
morale and fewer internal administrative/personnel problems.
   CMR offers two versions of the course. The fee for the all-up version,
requiring responses to essay questions, is $3,395 per pilot. Another
version that involves less individualized interaction with CRM, and
responses to multiple-choice questions, costs $2,495. If a corporation
wants to kick off the program with a two-day workshop on site, there's an
extra charge of roughly $3,000. Other workshop arrangements are
negotiable.

LET'S GET PHYSICAL

By:
R.O.R.

   Ever worry about what happens to the EKG that is transmitted to the FAA
during your flight physical? Many do-unnecessarily. The process has been in
use for years, and few bugs invade the system.
   The data from an AME's EKG machine are faxed to the FAA's EKG center in
Oklahoma City. There, a computer reads the data received. If the computer
reads something that is out of normal range, an FAA doctor reviews the
tracing. Then, if it is considered ``clinically significant'' (a true heart
problem), your AME may get a call. If it is only suspicious, the agency
will probably write you requesting that you have the EKG repeated. In the
latter case, the AME already has signed you off, so you won't be grounded.
But the FAA expects you to comply with its request for another test.
   But, what about those bugs that can affect any electronic transmission?
Contrary to popular belief, those electronic glitches are easily detected
because they don't come close to the signal put out by your heart. If a
faulty transmission occurs, there is often an immediate alarm in Oklahoma
City, and the FAA will attempt to call the AME before you leave the office.
At worst, you might have to return to the AME for a retest, but a pilot is
never grounded as a result of a transmission anomaly.
   What's more, before the agency required EKGs to be transmitted, there
were more errors and queries generated from handwritten copies being
mailed.
   Incidentally, it's smart to ask your AME to read your EKG before it's
transmitted to the FAA. The leads hooking you to the EKG machine can be
reversed or loose, or the doctor may need to explain a variation. Of
course, it's far more expedient if the FAA initially gets an accurate
tracing along with a clinically acceptable explanation for a variation.

A TUG HERE, A PUSH THERE

By:
G.A.G.


   Once more, communication and cooperation win without the power of size
or weight. We are referring to the success of smaller, regionally oriented
aviation groups to obtain significant changes in the way the federal
government does business.
   A few months ago, it was the New York State Aviation Association as
victor (B/CA, November 1995, page 42). This time, it is the culmination of
more than three years of effort by the Teterboro Users and Operators
Association-known locally as TUG (Teterboro Users Group).
   One of the tangible effects of TUG's constant dialogue with Northeast
area ATC officials has been a marked reduction in traffic delays at New
Jersey's Teterboro Airport. (See accompanying chart.)
   These reductions in delays come, in part, directly from the following
TUG-encouraged enhancements: the creation of a secondary departure
position, a VOR/DME approach for Runway 24, charted visual approaches for
Runways 1 and 6, lower minimums for the ILS to Runway 6, and the Dalton
Departure Procedure. The FAA is also working on developing an LDA approach
for Runway 19.
   TUG turned its attention to Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM)
criteria at a meeting with ATC officials in December 1995. The FAA provided
information on the cost and the process for obtaining RVSM approval.
   For more information on Northeast operations from the customer's point
of view, or on how to start your own local corporate aircraft association,
contact Peter Bellini, TUG president, at (201) 847-3399.

AVCOMPS UPDATE

By:
G.A.G.

   England-based Captain Zvi Doron, the person who brought you the
Hummingbird software for evaluating and comparing helicopter performance
(B/CA, September 1995, page 58), recently introduced similar software for
light and medium airplanes. Called Sparrowhawk, the PC-compatible program
allows comparison of performance capabilities for up to three aircraft
simultaneously. Parameters of aircraft from two-seat pistons to twin-engine
turboprops are included in the database.
   The program contains a list of default values to ensure an unbiased
comparison, says Doron. The defaults include number of crewmembers, crew
weight, average passenger weight and fuel reserves in terms of flying time.
The user can redefine these defaults according to the operating
conditions.
   Specific mission profiles can be tested by defining range or payload
requirements. An editing menu allows the user to explore numerous
combinations of existing, modified or new aircraft.
   In addition to having a PC with MS-DOS 3.0 or higher, users need at
least 640 KB of memory and a color or monochrome VGA monitor with a
standard resolution of 640 x 480.
   Software price is $175. For more information, contact Zvi Doron or
Andrew Healey at 56, The Glades, East Grinstead, West Sussex RH19 3XW

SAVANNAH SKY WELCOMES THE GULFSTREAM V

   The start of the airborne certification test phase of the Gulfstream V
(shown here on its 1+18 first flight on November 28, 1995) is significant.
The maiden flight of the 6,500-nm-range G-V occurred within 60 days of the
date Gulfstream set over 39 months ago (B/CA, October 1992, page 52), and
the initial flight of the airframe also marked the initial flight of the
BR710 engines, the first powerplant to be developed jointly by BMW and
Rolls-Royce. Three more G-Vs will join the flight-test program. If the
aircraft is FAA certificated in October, Gulfstream will meet the exact
schedule the company set in late 1992.

ATLANTIC CITY: THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THE FAA

By:
Robert A. Searles

   For most business-aircraft operators, the FAA is the local inspector who
dutifully, and usually cordially, conducts certification check rides and
maintenance inspections. But no matter how amicable your local Flight
Standards District Office (FSDO) representative is, there are times when
you wonder if the agency isn't just a Washington-based bureaucracy whose
primary objective is to make life difficult for those who fly.
   In an era in which it has become fashionable to criticize all government
agencies (especially regulatory bodies), it's tempting to think of the FAA
as a phalanx of curmudgeons bent on hassling operators. But despite current
stereotypes of aviation-agency personnel, there are 1,500 full-time
employees at the FAA's Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey who
are working quietly and conscientiously to develop new technologies and
procedures that will make flying safer, easier and more efficient.
   The FAA Technical Center, which recently celebrated its 15th
anniversary, is a national scientific test base for the agency's research,
development and acquisition programs. Located on the 5,000-acre, FAA-owned
Atlantic City International Airport, the Tech Center tests and evaluates
systems and procedures of ATC, airborne communications and navigation,
airports, aircraft safety and airline security.
   In addition, the Tech Center is responsible for long-range development
of innovative systems and concepts, as well as new aviation hardware and
software. The facility also modifies existing equipment and procedures. At
any given time, 150 projects are under way at the center.
   One of the reasons that much of the FAA's research and development is
conducted at the FAA Technical Center is because Atlantic City is subject
to a wide range of weather conditions. The site also is close to the
Northeast's high-density air-traffic corridor, yet has open airspace over
the nearby Atlantic Ocean.
   The Tech Center site, located 10 miles northwest of Atlantic City, was
originally developed during World War II as a naval air station. When the
aviation infrastructure was struggling to keep pace with the rapidly
expanding postwar use of civil aircraft, the Airways Modernization Board
took over the facility on July 1, 1958 and renamed it the National Aviation
Facilities Experimental Center (NAFEC).
   NAFEC inherited three dozen wooden buildings that were erected in the
early 1940s, which made it difficult to perform some of the experiments
that required strictly controlled test environments. Although the FAA moved
its fleet of specially instrumented aircraft into a new, modern hangar at
Atlantic City in 1968, for many years NAFEC was unable to get enough money
to modernize the other facilities there.
   By the early 1970s, the expense and inconvenience of continuing to work
in dilapidated buildings made the agency seriously consider moving its test
and evaluation functions to Oklahoma City. The poor working conditions at
Atlantic City, coupled with recurring rumors of the center's imminent
demise, took a toll on the morale of NAFEC personnel.
   However, the threat of an impending shutdown coalesced support among
NAFEC proponents. Local citizens-led by the first NAFEC director, a
congressman and a one-time Atlantic City mayor-formed a partnership with
other government officials to obtain the backing necessary to modernize
NAFEC's physical plant. Their efforts resulted in a new, $50-million,
four-story, 516,000-square-foot building. On May 29, 1980, Vice President
Walter Mondale and FAA Administrator Langhorne Bond presided over the
dedication of the new FAA Technical Center, the name by which not only the
building but also the entire complex has since been known.
   The Tech Center is unique because of its ability to conduct total
systems testing and integration. At least one example of every electronic
system installed in the ATC system-from those troublesome 1960s vintage
computers to the latest digital devices-can be found at Atlantic City. As
one Tech Center official said, ``We're the first FAA facility to get the
new equipment and the last to get rid of the old equipment.''
   By having access to all types of ATC equipment and utilizing the Tech
Center's immense simulation capability, project engineers can experiment
with modifications to existing equipment or procedures without having to
take a single runway or navaid out of service.
   In addition to relying on simulation of new equipment and techniques,
the Tech Center uses a variety of specially equipped aircraft to test-fly
new hardware and procedures, collect data and flight-check experimental
ground-based surveillance systems, navaids and other guidance systems. The
current fleet of ``flying laboratories'' consists of two Convair 580s and a
Sikorsky S-76 (all with glass cockpits), a Boeing 727-100, a Beech King Air
and a twin-piston Aero Commander.
   The Tech Center's aircraft operate primarily from Atlantic City
International Airport, which has two runways, including one that is 10,000
feet long. However, what makes the airfield distinctive are its
experimental approach and guidance systems. Atlantic City is the site of
the National Concepts Development and Demonstration Heliport and is
equipped with MLS, AWOS, PAPI and a system of reconfigurable landing
lights.
   The Tech Center also has one of the finest aircraft test ranges in the
world, and over the years, the facility's navigation branch has developed
an ex-ceptional data collection, reduction and analysis capability. As Tom
Grygotis, manager of the Tech Center's flight-test branch, said, ``You can
test things here you can't test anywhere else in the world.''
   But it takes qualified people as well as sophisticated equipment to make
a technical center. Atlantic City was able to make the transition from a
test and evaluation facility to one that is more involved in conceptual
work by injecting a lot of young, high-technology blood into the
organization, remembers former acting FAA Administrator Joseph Del Balzo.
He started at the Tech Center as a project engineer in 1960 and served as
director of the facility for five years beginning in 1976.
   ``We had a lot of joint programs with universities,'' recalled Del
Balzo, who now heads a consulting firm in Washington, D.C. ``Embry-Riddle
conducted advanced degree courses on [the Tech Center] campus, and we had a
doctorate program in human factors in conjunction with Columbia University.
At that time, we ran the government's largest co-op program, especially
with minority institutions, which accounts for the diversity at the Tech
Center today.''
   By attracting technically qualified people to Atlantic City, the Tech
Center was able to convince headquarters that it could assume complete
program responsibility for research into such areas as aircraft safety and
airport technology. This, in turn, led to a resident world-class technical
capability in a host of disciplines, from ATC simulation and aircraft
crashworthiness to fire testing and human factors.
   For example, the ATC simulation facility can replicate, in real time,
virtually any airport and traffic situation in the world on its radar
displays, thanks to its ability to ``fly'' up to 400 computer-generated
aircraft. The air traffic labs can be configured to represent an en route,
terminal or automated FSS facility, and a tower cab mockup is used to plan
the layout of positions and equipment for use in control towers.
   The Tech Center's Human Factors Lab uses advanced techniques, such as
virtual reality, to study the man-machine interface. Future airport designs
can be reviewed by flying approaches to computer-generated runways. This
lab also utilizes a reconfigurable cockpit simulator in which video
displays are altered to test various instrument panel layouts and
presentations.
   Also housed at the FAA Technical Center is the world's largest
full-scale, aviation fire-test facility. Experiments conducted there paved
the way for the development of fire-blocking seat materials, emergency
floor lighting, heat-resistant emergency slides and today's stringent
standards for cabins and cargo compartment materials.
   The Tech Center's aircraft crashworthiness facilities include a 50-foot
drop tower, a catapult and a track for rapid deceleration or impact tests.
A number of general-aviation aircraft-including a Beech 1900, one of two
remaining Learfans and a dozen Piper fuselages given to the FAA after the
company's Lock Haven factory was flooded in 1972-are being used at this
facility.
   Other test facilities located at the Tech Center range from wind tunnels
and chemistry labs to engine test cells and an environmental chamber that
can simulate heat, humidity, altitude and rainfall.
   What has all this research meant for business aviation? Besides
developing numerous improvements for the airspace system in general, the
Tech Center extensively flight-tested GPS in conjunction with industry,
which led to IFR certification of the system and creation of non-precision
GPS approaches. Atlantic City also developed general aviation
occupant-restraint systems and energy- absorbing seats. In addition, the
facility proved the feasibility of simple, inexpensive design changes that
enhanced the load-carrying capability of light airplanes.
   GA-related projects that the Tech Center is working on today include:
production of a viable no-lead avgas, refinement of TCAS I and development
of sensors that would give pilots a visual indication of icing.
   Despite the FAA Technical Center's immense capabilities, not every
project undertaken is successful. For example, the FAA's anti-misting
kerosene program, an effort to chemically alter turbine fuel to minimize
post-crash fires, didn't pan out. And some electronic systems, such as the
Beacon Collision Avoidance System (BCAS) and the Discrete Address Beacon
System (DABS), never made it into the field.
   But as former Tech Center director Del Balzo is quick to point out,
accomplishments shouldn't always be measured in terms of new systems.
``It's not so much the products and the technologies [produced by the Tech
Center], it's the development of people and a capability that will serve us
into the 21st century.''

CFIT PREVENTION

By:
Richard N. Aarons

   Flight Safety Foundation (FSF), the nonprofit, member-supported
international organization dedicated to improving flight safety, is
distributing a 33-minute videotape designed to help flightcrew members
avoid controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT) accidents. I urge you to beg,
borrow, steal or even buy a copy. This video, prepared by Jeppesen, is must
viewing for all pilots. The FSF will sell you a copy for $30 if you can't
find one elsewhere, but someone on your airport should have one soon; some
5,000 copies are being distributed at no cost to NBAA and FSF members.
   The video, funded by 28 commercial and organizational sponsors, is aimed
at flightcrews of busness turbine aircraft and regional transports.
However, its content is important for all IFR pilots. Basically, the tape
discusses the insidious nature of CFIT accidents-those in which flightcrews
were unaware of impending collisions with terrain-and it examines in detail
three such incidents.
   One accident, which involved a VOR approach in the Far East, includes
the final minutes of the U.S. corporate jet's cockpit voice recorder. It
enables us to listen in as misunderstanding grows between the controller
and the flightcrew until disaster becomes inevitable. It's a chilling
experience, but it carries with it an unforgettable lesson.
   Another CFIT example profiles a commuter accident that occurred during a
night approach over unlighted terrain in Canada. Computer animation enables
us to experience the black-hole effect that ultimately drew the crew into
the trees. The third accident involved a U.S. corporate jet that crashed
into a mountain shortly after takeoff. The crew was attempting to maintain
VFR while circling in hilly terrain trying to pick up an IFR flight plan.
   Stuart Matthews, FSF president, chairman and CEO, says this video ``is a
strong accident prevention tool,'' and we agree entirely with that
assessment. Says Matthews, ``The risk of being involved in a CFIT accident
is linked to a number of factors, including equipment, flightcrew training
and type of operation. Although the majority of CFIT fatalities occur on
large commercial aircraft, the largest number of CFIT accidents involve
smaller turboprop and jet aircraft. But no matter what type of aircraft you
fly, your CFIT risk increases dramatically during the approach phase.
   While you're tracking down a copy of the video, be sure to get a copy of
the FSF's CFIT checklist, a risk assessment tool that enables you to
evaluate the threat of CFIT in any specific operation. The videotape
project, along with the checklist and a simulator scenario (currently under
development by Boeing), are part of the FSF's five-year program to reduce
CFIT accidents by half.
   This excellent project is another reason why B/CA is a member of the
FSF, and why we urge all flight operations to support it through membership
activity or sponsorships. For more information, contact the FSF at 2200

MESABA DISCONTINUES DIVIDEND PAYMENTS

   Citing a need to concentrate working capital on acquisition of new
aircraft, Mesaba Holdings has announced that it is discontinuing the
payment of dividends to stockholders. The last dividend-three cents per
share-was paid in the June 1995 quarter.
   Bryan Bedford, the carrier's new president and CEO, said that the
Minneapolis-based regional continues to have a strong balance sheet and
that earnings remain in line with analysts' expectations. The company has
been conducting extensive evaluations of new aircraft, planning a
near-complete replacement of its existing fleet that includes 26 Fairchild
Metros and 25 de Havilland Dash 8-100s (B/CA, December 1995, page C2).
   ``The company is analyzing various fleet replacement options now and
expects to make a decision on the new fleet by the [1995],'' a statement
said. The carrier is believed to have selected the Beech 1900 to replace
the Metros, but also has been considering the 29-passenger Jetstream 41.
Heading the short list for a 30-passenger-class aircraft were the Dornier
328, Saab 340BPlus and the incumbent Dash 8-probably the 200 series.
Mesaba's existing Dash 8s begin coming off their short-term leases this
year.
   Mesaba operates as a Northwest Airlink carrier from the senior partner's
Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul hubs. Northwest owns approximately 30
percent of its affiliate, which operates 405 daily flights from the two
hubs.

SIEGEL HEADS UP CONTINENTAL EXPRESS

2David Siegel has been named president of Continental Express (COEx),
replacing Jonathan Ornstein, who recently resigned to pursue new airline
ventures.
   Siegel had served as vice president-route and fleet planning and
scheduling for big Continental, where he played a key role in the carrier's
operational turnaround, according to Continental President Gordon Bethune.
``Now he will turn his energies to this key subsidiary and optimize the
performance of Continental Express for the benefit of customers, employees
and stockholders,'' Bethune added.
   The new COEx president previously served as corporate planning director
at Northwest Airlines and held various positions with Bain & Company, an
international strategy consulting firm.

EAGLE BOARDS 75 MILLIONTH

   ``More than 75 million served. No, not hamburgers-people.'' That is the
way the AMR Eagle press release announced the carrier's 75 millionth
passenger in 11 years of operation. The actual number was 75.25 million,
which roughly equals one-third of the U.S. population.
   ``Becoming the first regional airline to transport more than 75-million
passengers is an incredible achievement and points to our growing niche in
the air transportation industry,'' said Eagle President Dan Garton. Eleven
years ago, the carrier operated just 60 daily flights to seven cities.
Today the number is more than 1,600 daily departures to more than 150
destinations in the United States, Canada, the Bahamas and the Caribbean,
making it the largest regional airline in the world.
   In an unrelated development, Eagle has named Lance McDonald to the newly
created position of vice president of flight operations. McDonald has
served the past seven years as vice president of flight operations for
Eagle unit Simmons Airlines.
   In his new job, McDonald will direct the development of standardized,
cost-effective flight operations and procedures among the four Eagle
carriers-Executive, Flagship, Wings West and Simmons. He also will oversee
revision and distribution of fleet-specific operations manuals, coordinate
operational and regulatory issues with the FAA, direct operations of
Eagle's Emergency Management Center, and supervise the carrier's System
Operations control, which includes crew scheduling and dispatch.
   One more newly created position still to be filled at B/CA press
time-that of vice president of maintenance and engineering-effectively
divides the responsibilities of Vice President of Operations Robert Zoller,
who is retiring after four years in the post. It was Zoller who supervised
a number of key operational changes at Eagle.
   They included the centralization and automation of Systems Operations
Control; creation of the Eagle Flight Training Center; design and
implementation of automated dispatch, flight planning and fuel planning
systems; and development of standardized maintenance inspection programs
for the Eagle fleet.

COMAIR TAKES ANOTHER 10 CRJS

   Delta Connection Comair has reaffirmed its affection for the Canadair
Regional Jet by exercising its options for 10 additional aircraft. The
order will bring the Cincinnati-based carrier's CRJ fleet to 45.
   Comair currently operates 26 CRJs and holds options that could take the
fleet to 70, making it by far the CRJ fleet leader. As of December 1, 1995,
the carrier operated its CRJ fleet to 48 destinations in the United States
and Canada with 188 daily flights.
   The order confirmed the 132 firm orders for the 50-passenger jet with 82
aircraft delivered to nine customers in the United States, Canada, France,
Austria and Germany.

CAT IIIA/HUD CERTIFICATED FOR CRJ

   Transport Canada has certificated the Canadair Regional Jet for Category
IIIA operations with the Flight Dynamics HGS 2100 head-up display. Aircraft
so-equipped can now be hand-flown to a 50-foot decision height and 700-foot
runway visual range (RVR).
   Approval by the European Joint Airworthiness Authority and the FAA was
expected shortly. The certification is expected to be especially helpful to
CRJ operators in Europe, where wintertime fog and weather-related delays
frequently disrupt airline schedules and increase costs.
   The Bombardier Regional Aircraft Division's Dash 8 turboprop received
CAT IIIA certification a year ago and the aircraft-with the Flight Dynamics
HUD-is in operation in the Pacific Northwest by Horizon Air.

DASH 8 TO DO AMMAN-TEL AVIV

   Royal Jordanian Airlines will operate a leased de Havilland Dash 8-300
over the new historical, first-ever air route between Amman and Tel Aviv.
The 50-passenger turboprop also will operate between Amman and the Red Sea
port of Aqaba, Jordan. The aircraft will operate from Amman's downtown
Marka Airport under the subsidiary name of Royal Wings.
   Amman-Tel Aviv service-a distance of 67 miles-was made possible by a new
bilateral air agreement between Jordan and Israel signed in late October
1995. Details of the service were not immediately available. The 171-mile
Amman-Aqaba flights will operate twice daily. Plans to serve both
Alexandria, Egypt and Beirut were being finalized. The aircraft also will
be used in charter operations, and the company is evaluating overnight
package delivery.

AIR BALTIC NEW SAAB 340 OPERATOR

   Latvia's new flag carrier, Riga-based Air Baltic, has entered into a
lease agreement for one used Saab 340A. In the interim prior to delivery,
the carrier is wet-leasing a 340 from Swedish regional Skyways, which also
is providing technical support for the new carrier.
   Air Baltic replaces Latvia, Latvian Airlines and Baltic International as
the designated Latvian carrier. Major shareholders include the Latvian
state, Baltic International USA, SAS, the Scandinavian financial
institution Swedfund, and the Investment Fund for Central and Eastern
Europe.
   ``We will use the aircraft in the 33-seat configuration with a large
galley,'' said Air Baltic President Kjell Fredheim. ``The Saab 340 has
proved itself in cross-border service for more than a decade and is the
right size to offer increased frequencies, making Riga attractive as a
regional hub.''

SAAB'S LATIN AMERICAN SALES DIRECTOR

   Guillermo Soto has been named Saab Aircraft of America's first full-time
sales director for all of Latin America.
   Soto is a former Mexicana Airlines pilot in B-727, DC-10 and Fokker 100
aircraft, accumulating more than 10,000 hours over 18 years. He began his
aviation career as a mechanic for the Beech Aircraft outlet in Mexico City
and later held various sales and marketing positions with Beech, promoting
the Beech 1900 in Mexico.
   In his new position, Soto is responsible for Saab 340/2000 sales,
marketing, finance and product support south of the U.S. border. He is
based in Mexico City.

FOKKER 70 SERVICE STARTS AT LCY

   Air France affiliate Air Littoral is the first carrier to serve the
downtown London City Airport with a Fokker 70. The carrier serves Paris
with the 79-passenger aircraft, making more than 30 flights weekly in each
direction.
   The service previously was provided with an ATR 42. The change
represents a 48-percent increase in capacity and results in the quickest
service between the two capitals.
   LCY is a special challenge for jet aircraft with its strict noise
limits, steep approach and short runway. The only other jet approved for
LCY service is the BAe 146/Avro series of quadjets, although the Fokker 100
make an exploratory visit to the airport in June. The manufacturer said it
would build on the F70 certification at LCY, but certification of the
larger F100 will depend on market demand.

ACA SECURES NEW FINANCING

   United Express carrier Atlantic Coast Airlines has secured a $20-million
line of credit with Shawmut Capital Corporation of Boston. The
Washington-Dulles-based carrier will use the funds to finance its
outstanding receivables, the company said.
   The three-year arrangement replaces the airline's existing credit line.
It will reduce ACA's annual interest expense and other related costs while
improving the terms of the carrier's receivable financing, it added.
   ``The financing agreement we reached with ACA is a classic example of
forging a beneficial relationship for both organizations,'' said Shawmut
Executive Vice President Ferrell Coppedge. ``For ACA, the lower financing
rates and better terms will allow them to build on the momentum of their
financial turnaround. For Shawmut, we are excited to have aligned ourselves
with a young and dynamic company that is clearly on the rise in their
industry,'' he added.

INDUSTRY FALLS UNDER A MICROSCOPE TO CONQUER SAFETY CHALLENGES

By:
James Ott

   The internal workings of commercial aviation-from flight operations to
aircraft maintenance and beyond-will fall increasingly under a microscope
as industry shoulders the safety challenges of the future.
   This message rang out clearly in several key presentations offered by
FAA and industry representatives at The McGraw-Hill Companies' Aviation
Week Group Chicago `95 Conference and Exhibit November 1 to 3. More than
150 participants and industry leaders from around the world discussed the
challenges ahead.
   Improving the margin of safety in U.S. aviation has become a primary
objective of government, industry and labor. Reducing the accident rate
will become increasingly urgent in view of the 40-percent increase in
direct flights expected over the next 10 to 15 years, FAA Administrator
David Hinson said.
   ``If we only manage to maintain today's low accident rate, the estimated
growth in aviation will increase the number of jet crashes worldwide to
about one a week,'' Hinson said, quoting the results of a Boeing Company
study.
   The FAA is in the process of implementing 173 detailed safety
initiatives that emerged from 1994's agency-sponsored Aviation Safety
Conference. The conference was prompted by a rare spate of accidents
including several involving regional carriers. Hinson singled out as a
foremost achievement of that conference the industry agreement that allows
the FAA access to data from airline flight operations.
   ``I hope this agreement will lay the groundwork for a much more
comprehensive international data exchange, which will make safety data
instantly available, onine, to aviation professionals everywhere in the
world,'' Hinson said.
   U.S. carriers are initiating programs of Flight Operations Quality
Assurance (FOQA) as part of this safety drive. Under these programs,
information from flight data recorders is being collected and analyzed. The
FAA and airlines are working out a method for the FAA to access the
information.
   Christopher Hart, assistant FAA administrator for system safety and a
panelist discussing ``Safety: Danger Zones of the Future,'' said the
analysis of airline operational data will allow the FAA to become
``proactive'' in safety. He predicts a cultural shift in the FAA toward the
prevention of unsafe operations and away from its traditional role of
enforcer of regulations.
   Hinson said the incident and accident data now compiled by the FAA are
``all anecdotal'' and virtually useless. Hart said the new emphasis lay on
analysis of greater quantities of data. The airlines and the FAA are now
working out ways to access the information.
   The Flight Safety Foundation has long advocated that airline management
should establish corporate safety departments and create a ``safety
culture'' within each carrier. It also has encouraged nonpunitive
approaches to accident and incident investigations. FSF president and chief
executive officer Stuart Matthews, another panelist, said that quality
assurance programs will act as an accident intervention strategy.
   ``The trends and subtle errors identified by this method, properly fed
back into briefings, training programs andmanagement policies, complement
the maintenance trend-analysis programs and can substantially reduce the
opportunities for error,'' he told the conference.
   Ove Dahlen, chairman of Saab Aircraft of America, noted that operations
data analysis has been conducted routinely and successfully by military air
forces. He also raised the point that, because of two accidents, the
regional/commuter industry was unfairly billed as unsafe and a motivating
cause of the Aviation Safety Conference. The record amply shows quite the
reverse: that commuter flying is safe, he said.
   The Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) program underway at Delta
Air Lines was described as a prime example of what is happening in
industry. Delta has consolidated safety operations into one office under
John Lauber, vice president of corporate safety and compliance.
   Lauber studied human factors as causes of accidents while at NASA and
later applied the concept in his crash investigative work as a two-term
member of the NTSB. Under Lauber, Delta has founded a Safety Council and
extended the reach of that council to a companion group that serves the
Delta Connection Carriers.
   Delta's safety program applies across the board and has been expanded to
include air and ground operations. Techniques used in crew resource
management (CRM) in which human factors come into play are being applied to
other kinds of work beyond the cockpit. Formal investigations of all
accidents and incidents are undertaken. The airline has adopted the
nonpunitive approach recommended by the FSF to the investigations.
   The human factors mission, Lauber told the group, was to:
   -- Foster a barrier-free working climate that inspires trust, teamwork,
quality and pride;
   -- Give everyone a stake in the operation and its outcome; and
   -- Push responsibility and authority down-foster accountability at all
levels.
   John O'Brien, director of engineering and safety for the Air Line Pilots
Association, said the FAA proposal to adopt Part 121 safety standards for
commuter/regional aircraft was a step in the right direction but still
falls short of ALPA's One Level of Safety program.
   ``But to clearly achieve One Level of Safety in this proposal, the FAA
must adopt a new attitude, one of taking valid ideas and using them because
they are correct,'' O'Brien said.
   He recommended the FAA: extend the Part 121 safety standards to
scheduled air cargo carriers; outline specific duties for safety directors;
reduce phase-in times for aircraft equipment modifications; provide both
pilots in the cockpit with airport and navigation charts; phase out
operations of certain small commuter aircraft models that do not meet
higher standards; strengthen requirements for emergency evacuation
demonstrations and for smoke detectors and fire suppression; require use of
TCAS II collision avoidance devices rather than TCAS I; improve training
requirements; boost standards and equipment for small airports used by
commuters; phase-in application of the age 60 mandatory retirement rule for
commuter pilots; and continue with plans to strengthen flight time limits
for all types of operators.
   During the conference, Henri Wassenbergh, the aviation scholar and
former Netherlands negotiator, received the L. Welch Pogue award from the
Aviation Week Group in recognition of his contributions to advancing the
cause of liberalization in international aviation.
   In his tenure as a Netherlands negotiator, Wassenbergh espoused free
trade in aviation. He was one of the inventors of country-of-origin
pricing, which became a commonly accepted article of bilateral aviation
agreements. He also conceived of the ``double disapproval'' provision for
agreements. Under that provision, low fares are encouraged and remain in
effect until each of the participants in a two-party agreement act to
withdraw them.
   The Pogue award, created by the Aviation Week Group, is named for the
Washington, D.C. resident who served U.S. aviation interests as an
appointee of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Pogue was named chairman of
the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) prior to World War II, and was appointed
a U.S. delegate to the 1944 international conference that authorized the
Chicago Convention, the legal framework for establishing rules of the air
and aviation standards through the ICAO.

BUSINESS AIRCRAFT SALES

   (January 1995 - November 1995)
Retail deliveries of turbine aircraft showed another uptick in November-a
lift that resulted from an 11.8 percent jump in worldwide sales of new jets
and turboprops in contrast to a 10.0 percent decline in resales.
And although the total number of sales of new and previously owned turbines
dropped 7.6 percent from 1994's 11-month total, the picture continued to
steadily improve.
   Preliminary data show U.S. sales of new aircraft rose 20.3 percent
through November, according to Wichita-based AvData. Domestic deliveries of
previoulsy owned turbines fell 7.4 percent behind last year's total.
   Revised U.S. data through October showed new and used turbine sales up
0.5 percent over last year including a 31.7 percent surge in new aircraft
sales and only a 2.8 percent drop in the used market.
   International sales during the first 11 months of 1995 dropped 29.2
percent below 1994's total. Deliveries of all new turbines fell 6.8 percent
while resales dropped by more than a third. Aggregate shortfalls
notwithstanding, preliminary reports through November showed sales of new
turboprops had already surpassed last year's annual total.
   Updated October figures revealed total sales outside the United States
declined 25.4 percent overall. New aircraft deliveries fell 4.9 percent
short of 1994's 10-month tally while resales were down 29.5 percent.
   AvData compilations encompass only sales to retail customers. Dealer and
broker transactions are not included. Monthly revisions reflect additional
information as it becomes available.

THE EMB 145: REGIONAL JET OR TURBOPROP SANS PROPS?
Embraer's new regional jet will not give the Canadair Regional Jet much of
a competitive tussle; the Saab 2000 is another story.

By:
Arnold Lewis

   The Embraer EMB-145 was originally conceived in early 1989 as a
45-passenger, stretched Brasilia designed to meet the growth needs of the
American Eagle carriers in the mid-1990s.
20 AMR Eagle took 50 options on the 50-passenger Saab 2000 high-speed
turboprop, and that was ostensibly the end of that competition. Ironically,
the 145 has rolled out and is in flight test as a 50-passenger regional
jet, and AMR Eagle still has not exercised any options for the Saab 2000.
Indeed, competition between the two aircraft may only be beginning.
20 Three months after AMR took its Saab 2000 options, the 145 re-emerged
as a regional jet. But it still looked like a turboprop. The nacelles
rested atop the basic Brasilia wing, which included a chord extension at
the leading edge and a super-critical airfoil with a 14-percent root
thickness; the nacelles simply contained a turbofan rather than a
turboprop. Embraer engineers reckoned that the configuration would save the
buyer $3 million in price over aft-mounted turbofans, which would have
required a redesign of the wing and the main landing gear installation.
Engineers were looking for improved field performance resulting from the
``blown-wing'' effect.
20 Engineers reasoned that the configuration would also minimize
foreign-object damage, reduce inlet-airflow distortion and diminish the
fly-over noise signature due to engine shielding by the wing. ``It will not
be the fastest regional jet, but it certainly will be the most
economical,'' said then-Embraer Chief Executive Ozilio da Silva. His
comparison was the Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ).
20 The problem was that wind-tunnel testing showed that the configuration
resulted in compressibility problems that would offset hoped-for
performance results. The engineers went to an under-wing engine
installation with a swept-wing, similar to the Boeing 737's. That met
performance requirements, but produced ground-clearance and maintenance
problems at the same time. In addition, commonality with the Brasilia was
diminished.

ENGINES MOVED AFT
   When Embraer's founding chief executive, Ozires Silva, returned to the
company in 1991 from a five-year hiatus as president of state-owned oil
company Petrobras and a stint in Brasilia as super-minister of
infrastructure, he ``moved the engines to the tail and put firm controls on
the aircraft specs. The letters of intent were based on firm specs,
especially operating costs and weight of structure,'' he told B/CA in a
recent interview (December 1995, page C6).
20 Ozires is proud of the fact that the airplane met its forecast
specifications, even down to the pound. In terms of maximum takeoff weight,
the 145 is 8,672 pounds lighter than the CRJ, and 7,937 pounds less than
the Saab 2000. Its zero-fuel weight is 6,302 pounds less than the CRJ and
5,702 less than the 2000-for the same number of passenger seats. The CRJ
numbers are for the extended-range version, for which most customers are
opting.
20 ``Published'' prices of the Saab 2000 and EMB-145 are identical at
$14.5 million each. The CRJ comes in at $18.6 million. Based on empty
operating weight, those prices equate to $480, $568 and $617 per pound,
respectively. Put another way, the 2000 and 145 come in at $290,000 per
passenger seat each, and the CRJ at $372,000 per seat.
20 Other than the fact that one is a turboprop and the other a
turbofan-albeit powered by the same Allison Engine Company core turbine-the
Saab 2000 and EMB-145 are amazingly similar in terms of performance and
productivity (see chart). B/CA measures productivity by operating aircraft
over continuous segments of 150, 275, 400 and 800 statute miles,
respectively, within the confines of a 14-hour duty day.
20 Optimum climb and cruise is selected for each aircraft, as is cruise
altitude. Ten minutes are used for taxi and takeoff, with descent to sea
level and no allowance for approach and landing. The profile allows for a
45-minute hold plus a 30-minute diversion, all at cruise altitude and
speed, which produces an apples-to-apples comparison.

TURBOPROP TOPS SHORT HOPS
   In the 150-sm mission, the Saab 2000 produces 13 total segments and
97,500 total available seat miles. Block speed is 195 knots with a block
fuel burn of 990 pounds. Both the 145 and the CRJ produce 14 daily segments
over the relatively short stage length and turn in an identical 105,000
seat miles. Block speeds are 219 and 226 knots, respectively, and block
fuel is 1,222 and 1,325 pounds, respectively. (All EMB-145 data used in
this comparison are preliminary.)
   At 275 sm, the CRJ jumps out ahead, with 12 daily trips compared to 10
each for the 2000 and 145. Seat-mile production is 165,000 for the CRJ
versus 137,500 each for the 2000 and 145. The CRJ produces a block speed of
309 knots, compared to 246 for the 2000 and 265 for the 145.
20 Seat-mile production for the 2000 and the 145 are identical as well at
400 and 800 sm, at 160,000 and 200,000, respectively. The CRJ produces
200,000 seat miles at 400 miles and 240,000 at 800 miles.
20 Mileage production is not the only factor, however. Field distance
tips the scales to the turboprop. The Saab 2000, despite a takeoff weight
higher than the 145's, turns in an SL/ISA balanced field length of less
than 4,400 feet. That compares to more than 4,900 feet for the 145 and more
than 6,000 for the CRJ. Bump those airport conditions up to 5,000 feet and
ISA+ 20C, and the distances jump to 6,100, 8,450 and 9,900 feet,
respectively.
20 All-engine climb rates for the 2000 and 145 are identical at 2,380
feet per minute, compared to 3,200 fpm for the CRJ. Cruise speeds at
optimum altitude for the 2000, 145 and CRJ produced block speeds of 280,
350 and 370 knots, respectively.
20 But in terms of tankering fuel-when contract fuel is not available at
the outstations, the 2000 produced seven stages per fueling in the 150-sm
mission, versus three each for the 145 and CRJ. At 275 sm, the spread was
three, two and three, respectively. It is two stages across the board at
400 sm and one, one and two at 800 sm.

31-INCH PITCH VS. FOUR-ABREAST
   The 2000 has the advantage on seat pitch at 32 inches versus 31 inches
for the two jets. It also tops the 145 in cross-section-7.1 feet compared
to 6.9 for the 145 and 8.4 for the CRJ. The latter offers four-abreast
seating versus three each for the 2000 and the 145. All are derivatives of
earlier aircraft, the Saab 340, EMB-120 Brasilia and Canadair Challenger
business jet, respectively.
20 Embraer officials like to talk about their ``back to basics'' approach
to the design and development of the 145. They have good reason. The
earlier CBA-123 pusher-turboprop development program-a 70/30 partnership
with Argentina's Fabrica Militar de Aviones (FMA)-was a financial disaster.
The 19-passenger aircraft had all the bells and whistles, and the costs
rocketed. Realistic price estimates ranged from $6 million to $8 million.
That compares with around $4 million for existing 19-passenger aircraft.
20 With Ozires Silva back at the helm, operating costs and weight became
primary considerations in the development of the 145, as well as the ``back
to basics'' rationale-''technology in the right measure to meet with the
demands of operators worldwide.'' That rationale was based on four
actions:
   -- Take advantage of state-of-the-art technology while aiming at
reducing costs;
   -- Maximize commonality with the EMB-120 Brasilia and CBA-123
Vector;
   -- Apply concurrent engineering to avoid modifications during the
production phase; and
   -- Make comprehensive, extensive use of the latest CAD tools, such as
the use of electronic mock-ups, to reduce production costs. The company
said that over 20,000 computerized drawings were generated in EMB-145
development.

MANY RISK-SHARERS
   The manufacturer also made extensive use of risk-sharing partnerships to
spread the cost of development. Estimated at $300 million, the cost was
split as follows: 33 percent from risk-sharing partners, 10 percent from
participating suppliers, 23 percent from Brazilian development funding
institutions, and 34 percent from Embraer itself.
20 The risk-sharing partners are:
   -- Gamesa of Spain-wings and nacelles, in association with INS of
Northern Ireland; and wing-to-fuselage fairings, main landing gear doors
and leading edges, in association with Sonaca of Belgium.
   -- C&D Interiors of the United States-passenger cabin/cargo compartment
interiors.
   -- Sonaca of Belgium-center fuselage, main door, service door, rear
fuselage, pylons and baggage door.
   -- Enaer of Chile-vertical fin, horizontal stabilizer and elevators.
20 There are some 28 U.S. suppliers for the 145 in non-risk-sharing
capacities, not the least of which is Allison Engine Company. Embraer was
the launch customer for the AE3007, although Cessna got the engine airborne
first on the Citation X business jet.
20 The 145 installation calls for 7,475 pounds of maximum takeoff thrust,
or an alternate takeoff rating of 6,930 pounds. It is a 5:1 high-bypass
turbofan with one accessory gearbox driven by the gas-generator spool. The
gas generator spool incorporates a 14-stage compressor driven by a
two-stage turbine. The installation incorporates Full Authority Digital
Engine Controls (FADEC) without mechanical back-up.
20 An AlliedSignal auxiliary power unit is mounted in the tail as
standard equipment. It supplies pressurized air for the aircraft pneumatic
system and is an electrical power source either simultaneously or
independently from the aircraft electrical system.
20 Up front, the 145 offers what Embraer calls a ``quiet and dark''
cockpit, designed for crew comfort during all phases of flight. The
avionics system is the Honeywell Primus 1000 and incorporates a five-tube,
eight- by seven-inch glass cockpit. Primary Flight Displays (PFDs) are at
the far left and right of the panel, framing dual Multi-Function Displays
(MFDs) for navigation displays, weather radar and TCAS advisories. They
also can show maintenance data as well as checklists. The center unit is
dedicated to EICAS primary indications.

COMPOSITES EMPLOYED
   The 145 incorporates a fair amount of composites. Wing panels and
control surfaces, and landing-gear doors are either carbon/Nomex or
carbon/Kev-lar. Interior panels, radome and wing-to-fuselage fairings are
of fiberglass or fiberglass/Nomex. The vertical-fin leading edge and
fairing is Kevlar or a combination of that and fiberglass or Nomex.
Interior flooring is a sandwich panel of either carbon/Nomex or
fiberglass/Nomex.
20 The basic airframe structure is of aluminum construction with formed
sheet, machined and extruded parts. Chemical milling is used extensively
for a better fatigue/weight combination. The structure is designed to meet
damage-tolerance criteria except for the landing gear, where the safe-life
concept is applied. The structure is designed for 75,000 flight hours or
60,000 cycles.
20 Four aircraft will be engaged in a 13-month, 1,300-hour certification
flight-test program that actually got under- way prior to the airplane's
official rollout in August 1995. They will be the prototype-Serial Number
801-plus three pre-production series aircraft-Serial Number 001, 002 and
003. The latter will later be refurbished and sold in the market. Two other
structures-Serial Number 802 and 803-will be used in static and fatigue
tests. Certification and initial customer delivery will take place late
this year.
20 The initial production rate will be three per month, to be reached in
1998, but that rate can be increased to a maximum of four per month. The
company plans to build 24 this year. Officials during a rollout went out on
a limb by suggesting that the program could break even at between 200 and
250 airplanes. Predicting break-even production, however, is a
``never-never land'' seldom reached. Still, the company expects to secure
40 percent of what it says is a worldwide market for 1,000 fast regional
aircraft over the next 10 years, with two-thirds of that market in the
United States.
20 There are only 18 firm orders, plus 16 options, for the
airplane-Flight West of Australia and Regional Airlines of France are the
early customers. But the manufacturer and the Brazilian government are
still engaged in establishing a government-backed financial scheme to
support the sales (B/CA, December 1995, page C6).
20 Embraer sees its customer base as current operators of the EMB-120
Brasilia. Indeed, prominent during rollout ceremonies in August were
executives of Delta Connection carriers Comair and SkyWest, both large
Brasilia fleet operators that also operate the CRJ.
20 One told B/CA that it is a perception thing. ``The perception is that
turboprops are small airplanes.''

WIND-SHEAR ENCOUNTER AT CHARLOTTE
Despite the presence of airborne and ground wind-shear detection systems,
Flight 1016 came to grief in an unanticipated microburst.

By:
Richard N. Aarons

   We've all heard that accidents usually befall us not because of a single
catastrophic event, but rather as the culmination of the unidirectional
alignment of a long series of relatively benign events. There is no better
example of this phenomenon than the loss of USAir Flight 1016 in a
wind-shear encounter on July 2, 1994 at Charlotte/Douglas International
Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina. Thirty-seven passengers were killed,
and 14 others were seriously injured when the DC-9-31 collided with trees
and a private residence as the pilots attempted to execute a missed
approach from the Runway 18R ILS. The captain and first officer, one flight
attendant and one passenger suffered minor injuries.
   The NTSB said the probable causes of this accident were:
   (1) The flightcrew's decision to continue an approach into severe
convective activity that was conducive to a microburst,
   (2) The flightcrew's failure to recognize a wind-shear situation in a
timely manner,
   (3) The flightcrew's failure to establish and maintain the proper
airplane attitude and thrust setting necessary to escape the wind shear,
and
   (4) The lack of real-time adverse weather and wind-shear hazard
information dissemination from ATC.
   All of these factors led to an encounter with, and failure to escape
from, a microburst-induced wind shear that was produced by a rapidly
developing thunderstorm located at the approach end of Runway 18R.
   Contributing to the accident, said the Safety Board, were:
   -- The lack of ATC procedures that would have required the controller
to display and issue ASR-9 radar weather information to the pilots of
flight 1016,
   -- Charlotte tower supervisor's failure to properly advise and ensure
that all controllers were aware of and reporting a reduction in visibility
and the runway visual range (RVR) value information along with the
low-level wind-shear alerts that had occurred in multiple quadrants,
   -- The inadequate remedial actions by USAir to ensure adherence to
standard operating procedures, and
   -- The inadequate software logic in the airplane's wind-shear warning
system that did not provide an alert upon entry into the wind shear.
   In addition to the causal factors, the NTSB made the additional
observation that this accident occurred despite the following aspects in
the flight's favor:
   (1) The flightcrew had received extensive training on CRM techniques as
well as wind-shear avoidance and escape;
   (2) The airplane was equipped with modern wind-shear detection and
escape avionics;
   (3) The airport was equipped with a low-level wind-shear alerting
system;
   (4) ATC personnel were looking at a mean thunderstorm with a
sophisticated ASR-9 scope and with their eyeballs;
   (5) The aircraft had enough power to climb out of the microburst it
encountered; and
   (6) The flightcrew ultimately made the proper decision to abort the
approach.
   To understand what happened, you need a feeling for the timeline. NTSB
investigators put it together this way:
   The crew began a planned three-day sequence from Pittsburgh (PIT) at
0945 hours on the morning of the accident. The trip segments for the day
included en route stops at La Guardia (LGA), Charlotte (CLT) and Columbia,
South Carolina (CAE), followed by a return trip to CLT and a final stop in
Memphis (MEM). The accident oc-curred on the fourth leg from CAE to CLT
while the first officer was performing the duties of the flying pilot.
   The flight departed CAE on schedule at 1823 hours. The forecast weather
for CLT was pretty much as it had been when the crew cycled through the CLT
hub earlier that afternoon, except for the additional notation of
``scattered thunderstorms in the area.'' A minute after the airplane broke
ground for the 35-minute flight, the captain made contact with Charlotte
TRACON's arrival west controller and reported the crew had ATIS for CLT.
   During the short en route leg at 12,000 feet, the cockpit voice recorder
(CVR) picked up routine ATC and cockpit discussions, including indications
that crewmembers were analyzing radar returns and planning their arrival
thoughtfully. Six minutes after departure, the first officer commented,
``There's more rain than I thought there was . . . it's starting . . .
pretty good a minute ago . . . now it's held up.'' A minute later, the
captain radioed the approach controller and stated, ``We're gonna swing
just five degrees to the right here just for about uh a quarter . . . half
mile.'' The controller approved the request.
   As they approached the Charlotte area from the south-southwest,
crewmembers observed two cells on their airborne weather radar-one located
south and the second located east of the airport. The radar return from the
cell south of the airport had a red center surrounded by yellow edges.
   At 1832 hours, the captain began a three-minute conversation with the
arrival controller about possible deviations as the aircraft maneuvered for
the approach. The flight was issued a clearance to descend to 6,000 feet,
and was switched to the final radar west (FRW) controller who cleared it on
down to 4,000 feet and told it to expect Runway 18R.
   The captain acknowledged the transmission, and then stated to the first
officer, ``Approach brief.'' The first officer responded, ``visual back up
ILS.'' The controller then issued a clearance to Flight 1016 to ``. . .
turn 10 degrees right, descend and maintain two thousand three hundred,
vectors visual approach runway one eight right.'' About this same time, the
tower supervisor made the remark in the tower cab that it was ``raining
like hell at the south end of the airport, and the FEW controller looked at
the airport surveillance radar (ASR-9) and observed a VIP level-three cell
``pop-up'' near the airport.
   At 1836:55, ``the FRW controller radioed flight 1016 and said, ``I'll
tell you what USAir ten sixteen, they got some rain just south of the
field, might be a little bit coming off north, just expect the ILS now,
amend your altitude maintain three thousand.'' The USAir captain
acknowledged the transmission.
   Meanwhile, on another frequency, the local east controller was warning
an arriving DHC-8 of ``heavy, heavy rain on the airport now, wind one five
zero at one four.'' At this point, the FRW controller turned Flight 1016
onto the final approach course, and told the crew to maintain 3,000 to the
marker and then contact the tower. The crew had visual contact with the
airport and could see rain.
   While Flight 1016 was still with the FRW controller, USAir 806 was
taxiing for takeoff and discussing the weather with a local controller.
``And [this is] eight-o-six, looks like we've gotten a storm right on the
top of the field here.'' The local controller responded, ``affirmative.''
   In the cockpit of Flight 1016, the captain told the first officer, ``If
we have to bail out . . . it looks like we bail out to the right.'' This
was followed by the captain saying, ``chance of shear.''
   At 1839:38, the captain checked in with the local controller, who
replied, ``USAir ten sixteen . . . runway one eight right, cleared to land
following an F-K one hundred short final. Previous arrival [USAir 677, a
Fokker FK-28 that landed about four minutes earlier] reported a smooth ride
all the way down the final.'' The captain responded, ``USAir ten sixteen,
I'd appreciate a PIREP from that guy in front of us. [The airplane
referenced by the captain of Flight 1016 was USAir Flight 984, a Fokker
FK-100 that had circled from Runway 23 to land on 18R.] The LCW controller
relayed the report of a ``smooth ride'' to Flight 1016.
   Later the captain and first officer testified that the ``edge of the
rain'' was a ``thin veil'' through which they could see the runway, and it
was located ``between us and the runway.''
   About 1836 hours, a special weather observation was recorded, and a new
ATIS was prepared, reporting a thunderstorm on the airport. The information
was not broadcast until 1843 hours. The flightcrew of USAir 1016 never
received it.
   At 1840:37, the LCE controller advised USAir Flight 52, a Boeing 737
departing Runway 18L, ``. . . aircraft just departed ahead of you said
smooth ride on departure wind is one zero zero at one niner gusting two
one.'' USAir Flight 52 was then issued a takeoff clearance.
   At 1840:50, the LCW controller said, ``USAir ten sixteen, wind now one
one zero at two one.''
   At 1841:05, the CVR recorded the captain saying, ``stay heads up,'' and
the LCW controller's radio transmission of ``wind-shear alert northeast
boundary, wind one nine zero at one three.'' Meanwhile, at 1841:08, the LCE
controller had transmitted, ``attention all aircraft, wind-shear alert, the
surface wind one zero at two zero, northeast boundary wind one nine zero at
one six.'' However, the LACE radio transmission occurred on a different
radio frequency and was not heard by the crew of Flight 1016.
   At 1841:17, the LCW controller issued a landing clearance to the
aircraft following Flight 1016, and also reported that the wind was ``. . .
one zero zero at two zero, wind-shear alert northeast boundary wind, one
niner zero at one seven.'' At 1841:54, the CVR recorded the captain's
comment ``here come the wipers,'' followed three seconds later by the sound
of rain.
   The first officer commented, ``There's, ooh, 10 knots right there.''
This was followed by the captain saying, ``Okay, you're plus 20 [knots] . . .
take it around, go to the right.'' The NTSB later concluded that the
captain was unaware that the airplane had penetrated the first part of a
microburst and, therefore, commanded the first officer to execute a
standard missed approach rather than a wind-shear escape procedure. The
captain would later recall that the airplane was about 450 feet agl when he
ordered the missed approach. The flight data recorder (FDR) tape indicated
the airplane was closer to 200 feet agl at that time.
   The flight had 21 seconds to go before impact.
   The captain radioed ``USAir ten sixteen's on the go,'' and then said,
``max power.'' The first officer said, ``yeah max power.''The FDR recorded
an increase in engine power to 1.82 EPR, which actually was below the
standard go-around limit of 1.93. The first officer had established the
appropriate 15-degree nose-up attitude and had begun to enter a
17-degree-banked turn to the right.
   The tower controller, said, ``USAir ten sixteen, understand you're on
the go sir, fly runway heading, climb and maintain three thousand.''
The first officer called for ``flaps to fifteen.'' Two seconds later, the
captain said to the first officer, ``down, push it down'' and then radioed
to the tower controller, ``up to three we're taking a right turn.''
The tower controller responded, ``USAir ten sixteen, understand you're
turning right.''
   Then, the CVR recorded the GPWS aural alert (whoop, whoop, terrain), and
an unidentified voice calling ``power.'' Over the next two seconds, the CVR
picked up sounds similar to a stick-shaker activation, and then sounds of
ground impact.
   Later analysis showed that Flight 1016 encountered a microburst about
six seconds after initiating the missed approach from Runway 18R. The
microburst was generated by convective activity that was centered near the
east side of Runway 18R and that had cloud tops at 30,000 feet. It was
about 3.5 kilometers in diameter and was capable of producing a rainfall
rate of about 10 inches per hour. Total wind change near the ground was
about 75 knots, with the strongest downward vertical winds, below 300 feet
agl, calculated to be 600 fpm to 1,200 fpm. Pilots on the ground and in the
air reported that the thunderstorm appeared as a small echo approximately
three miles in diameter, and indicated ``mostly red'' on the radar.
   Computations indicate that during the initial climb, after the missed
approach was initiated and during the final descent (to within two to three
seconds of ground impact), the wind along the flight path changed
significantly. Computations revealed that the wind shifted from a headwind
of about 35 knots to a tailwind of about 26 knots in 15 seconds. The
vertical-velocity component of the wind field was also examined, and it was
determined that the vertical-wind velocity increased from about 600
fpm-down to about 1,500 fpm-down, and increased further to 1,800 fpm-down
as the airplane attained its maximum altitude and made the transition into
a descent.
   Safety Board investigators, using simulators to explore DC-9-31
performance limits, determined the accident aircraft could have flown out
of this microburst if the first officer had maintained a 15-degree nose-up
pitch, and if the power had been set properly. But the first officer
responded to the captain's command of ``down, push it down,'' thus changing
the aircraft's pitch attitude from 15-degrees nose-up to five-degrees
nose-down over a seven-second period.
   Why did the captain give this command? The investigators don't know,
because the captain testified that he did not recall issuing it. However,
the Safety Board believes a likely explanation is that during the last
minute of flight, the captain-upon losing his visual cues instantaneously
when the airplane encountered heavy rain-could have experienced a form of
spatial disorientation.
   This disorientation, said the NTSB, ``might have led him to believe that
the aircraft was climbing at an excessively high rate and that the pitch
attitude should be lowered to prevent an aerodynamic stall.'' When the
airplane encountered the heavy rain, said the investigators, the flightcrew
would have lost their outside horizon visual reference. Also, it might not
have been possible for the captain to regain situational focus on the
primary flight instruments because he was performing other tasks.
   Further, because the flightcrew was initiating the missed approach
(which involved a large increase in engine thrust, a pronounced increase in
pitch attitude, and a banked turn to the right), the crew would have been
exposed to significant linear and angular accelerative forces. These forces
could have stimulated the flightcrew's vestibular and proprioceptive
systems, and produced a form of spatial disorientation known as
somatogravic illusion.
   How about the first officer's actions? The Safety Board analyzed them
this way: As the flying pilot, the first officer would have maintained a
scan of several instruments. These instruments would have given him the
best situational awareness by providing essential information about
airspeed, altitude and attitude. However, he reacted to the captain's
command without challenging it. One of the principles in the practice of
crew resource management (CRM) is the uninhibited challenge of the captain
by the first officer when an unsafe condition exists or an inappropriate
command has been issued.
   The Safety Board ``believes that the first officer should have been
fully aware of the airplane's proximity to the ground when the captain
commanded the missed approach [200 feet agl], as well as their altitude
[350 feet agl] when the captain commanded, `Down, push it down.' Thus, the
first officer's immediate reaction should have been to challenge the
impropriety of the command rather than reacting first.''
   The NTSB felt that the flightcrew members' comfortable working
relationship set up the environment for the CRM failure. For example, they
had conducted casual conversations during parts of the flight in which
sterile cockpit procedures should have been in effect; they violated
company SOPs in the way they conducted checklists and briefings; and,
together, they lost situational awareness in the end.
   Of course, they were getting a lot of help in the negative sense from
everything else that was happening (or not happening) at the time. For
example, most of the ATC-pilot chatter about the developing cell was on
other frequencies, not the ones they were working. The low-level wind-shear
alerts were not sufficiently transmitted to them. All of their simulator
training had associated wind shear with turbulence, and no turbulence
occurred in this microburst event. And, the wind-shear detection system on
board did not function properly and did not warn crewmembers of the
encounter.
   The NTSB issued several recommendations to the FAA after its
investigation into this accident. Most are on the subject of getting
weather information from various ATC positions to the cockpit. Other
recommendations call for improving training to emphasize the importance of
CRM and sterile cockpit concepts. Still others have to do with the software
problems that caused the airborne wind-shear detection system to fail.
   This accident, like most, simply should not have happened, yet it did.
And that's the lesson we must take away from it. As we've seen, all human
and mechanical systems designed to prevent such mishaps failed in this
incident.
   In the end, we are reminded that flying airplanes requires us to be ever
vigilant.

SO WHAT'S UP WITH FREE FLIGHT?

       With the conclusion of the RTCA Task Force on free flight,
the publicly visible activity on this fast rising endeavor has
dropped down a couple of notches. Publicly, the industry is awaiting
the formal response of FAA Administrator Hinson to the Task Force
report and recommendations. At a less visible level, there is much
afoot. The outcome of these activities will go far to determine the
eventual success or failure of the free flight effort, as well as
identify who will emerge as the key players in the ongoing
evolution of our airspace system.
       There is little doubt among industry observers that the FAA
will roundly endorse the Task Force report. The most likely scenario
is some sort of public meeting, probably in the DC area, within the
next 3-4 weeks, at which FAA will endorse the report, outline how
it intends to move on the report recommendations, and introduce to
industry the members and structure of the key Free Flight Steering
Committee, which has quietly been organized over the past 4 weeks.
       This Steering Committee of high ranking and prestigious
individuals from the aviation community will exist and operate under
the auspices of RTCA. It will provide the forum for the much needed
industry/government collaboration in carrying out the evolving
requirements of the emerging CNS/ATM system. It will be led by two
co-chairs, one from industry and one from government, both high
ranking individuals who have the position and the power to help
ensure that the Steering Committee's actions are taken seriously in
both camps and are carried out expeditiously.
       On the industry side, the notion and even the phrase free
flight have taken hold more quickly than anyone could have
anticipated. It is almost impossible to read any industry trade
publication without seeing these magic words. Daily mention in
company press releases is common.
       Special free flight marketing packages abound. I just received
one of the most clever mailings from one of the giant avionics
manufacturers, in a large box, delivered by express mail, which
included a "free flight" frisbee, a well-written pamphlet on the
background and concept of free flight, and a second booklet mapping
the products and services of the company to the requirements of
free flight in a CNS/ATM environment.
       Companies are jockeying for position, each trying to present
itself as an organization that can contribute successfully to the
evolution of the airspace system, in accordance with the free flight
concept. The MITRE Corporation recently held the first of an
intended series of invitation-only meetings that deal with specific
free flight issues and the technologies that will support them.
       Interesting and valuable forums for moving the concept
forward, these meetings are also clearly intended to ensure MITRE
carves out a key position in this rapidly changing industry. Other
companies are striving for the same end, many forming "strategic
partnerships" that combine key business and technology talents and
experience, and better position the resulting entity to win a large
share of the developing CNS/ATM market.
       On the government side, work is rapidly progressing on the
documenting of the official FAA architecture of the national
airspace system. It is certain that the Task Force report is being
used as a key input to this process. The first cut at this
architecture document is due out next month.
       Although we have no formal FAA response to the free flight
report, this has been a busy and interesting two months. The
intensity of activity can only increase once the FAA goes public
with its endorsement.

FAA REPORTS FURTHER PROGRESS ON DGPS PSEUDOLITE APPROACH NAVIGATION

       FAA recently reported the successful conclusion of a second
round of feasibility testing on local area DGPS with pseudolite (PL)
augmentation for approach navigation. The FAA Technical Center and
Stanford Telecommunications (STel) have been investigating the
feasibility of using PLs to improve DGPS system availability and
continuity of function. STel has a contract to develop a code-based
DGPS nav system that uses PLs both as a data link and as a ranging
source. Actual flight tests were completed in November.
       By using PLs as ranging sources, the number of GPS satellites
needed to meet RNP standards is decreased, thereby increasing system
availability. It is expected that the PL will also increase system
accuracy. In the flight tests, differential corrections were
transmitted via the PLs to the aircraft in a WAAS-compatible format
at 250 baud. The tests were conducted in ILS look-alike approaches
of 3 degrees from 12 nmi out. The Center's Convair 580 was used for
all flight testing.
       Due to a software glitch, the tests were unable to validate
the expected improvements in system accuracy. Use of the PL as a
data link transmitter was successful. The PL used the same antenna
system as is used to receive signals from the GPS constellation, PL
transmissions did not interfere with the signals from GPS
satellites, and the transmitted corrections were sufficient to
enable the GPS receivers to calculate a real-time differential
solution.
       The LAAS program office is reportedly considering funding a
second phase of such tests to further explore the possible and
potential roles that PLs might play as a component of the LAAS
architecture.

PETAL PROGRAM CONTINUES IN EUROPE

       Since last May, Eurocontrol and Aerospatiale have been
conducting "real world" trials of data link on Airbus aircraft
transiting Maastricht airspace. The Preliminary Eurocontrol Test of
Air/ground data Link (PETAL) aims to capture first hand operational
requirements feed-back and increase operational awareness of the
potential value of data link in an ATC environment.
       The aircraft being used are all Airbus aircraft being ferried
from the Toulouse, France, assembly plant to the DASA plant in
Hamburg, Germany. Each aircraft is equipped with an FMS, ACARS MU,
VHF3 radio, and a specially configured ACARS MCDU. Controllers use a
touch panel input device and electronic data display for message
input and display. Data link messages are transmitted over the SITA
network using AEEC, SITATEX, and AIRCOM compliant message formats.
       PETAL allows aircrews and controllers to carry out ATC comms
by air/ground data link daily. Specific exchanges include: ATC
requests, clearances, and acknowledgments for flight levels and
direct routing; ATC instructions and acknowledgments for voice
frequency management; manual downlink of aircrew preferences such as
top-of-descent and flight levels; and automatic, periodic downlink
of airborne data such as winds.

STUDY: FAA SHOULD REPLACE ATC CENTER POWER SYSTEMS QUICKLY

       A team of electric power experts says the FAA should continue
to replace the power systems at the nation's 21 Air Route Traffic
Control Centers (ARTCCs), but warns that the transition to the new
systems ought to be made as quickly as possible.
       "The existing systems are sufficiently reliable to be used
until transition is complete, assuming that the FAA keeps to the
planned two-year schedule," writes the Blue Ribbon Power Outage Team
in a report released Jan. 19. "The old systems are deteriorating,
though, and it is imperative that replacements be installed as soon
as is feasible."
       The $350-million program to replace ARTCC Critical/Essential
Power Systems (ACEPS) is under way and scheduled for completion next
year.
       In the meantime, the panel, formed last year, had almost 50
recommendations, including:
       *  Enhance training of power-system technicians;
       *  Improve training on the transition to ACEPS equipment, and
increase communication among centers; and
       *  Review the management of critical and essential power
systems.
       The FAA says the recommendations either have been implemented
or are being examined.

  ...FAA Needs Money to Train ATC Technicians

       Until new computer hardware and software arrives at the
nation's ARTCCs [see chart at right], FAA technicians will have to
make do with what's there. But the FAA doesn't have enough money to
train the technicians: the agency requested $30 million for training
this fiscal year but got only $23 million.
       "My highest priority is to find the money for this training,"
said Monte Belger, FAA Associate Administrator for Air Traffic
Services.
       Developing a training plan is one of more than four dozen
steps the FAA says it is taking to minimize the problems caused by
the aging computer equipment at the ARTCCs. Some of the equipment
is decades old, and breakdowns last year delayed thousands of
travelers, and focused media and congressional pressure on the FAA.
       In the second of two reports released Jan. 19, the agency
outlined steps it is taking to reduce the effects of future
breakdowns.
       Among the steps are:
       *  Revamp contingency plans at the 21 centers and test them;
       *  Do a better job of getting input from workers at the
centers about acquisition of new equipment;
       *  Establish a national process for disseminating information
about problems at the centers and lessons learned from the problems.
       Belger said Jan. 19 he didn't yet know how much it will cost
to implement all of the plans.

AIRWAYS OF NEW ZEALAND SELECTS ARINC TO PROVIDE DATA LINK FOR FANS
I

       AIRWAYS Corporation of New Zealand (ACNZ) has selected ARINC
Inc. as its data link service provider for their FANS I
communications service. The contract will facilitate air/ground
communications in the Auckland Flight Information Region (FIR)
during the final phase of ACNZ's upgrade to an automated ATC
system. ARINC has provided internetworking communication services
for the ACNZ Oceanic ATC Automation Workstation since it became
operational in September 1995.
       The ARINC-provided services are scheduled to be operational in
time for the site integration of the new ATC equipment in April.
These include Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) and
Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS), linking air traffic
controllers and flight crews of FANS 1-equipped aircraft.
Participating aircraft must have Boeing's FANS 1 FMS enhancement for
the B747/400 or similar equipment on other aircraft types.
       ARINC provides FANS I services to the FAA Oakland and
Anchorage ARTCCs, which control the Pacific Ocean FIRs. It is also
providing similar services for operational trials of ATC automation
in the Russian Far East.  These on-going trials began in September
1995, when a United flight first used the system to fly from
Chicago to Tokyo.

TRIPLE TRIMBLE GPS UNITS REPLACE INS ON B747 FOR SOLE MEANS
NAVIGATION

       The FAA has granted Canard Aerospace an STC for a triple
installation of the Trimble 8100 GPS navigation system on an
Evergreen International Airline B747-100. This is the first time
that an INS on a B747 has been completely replaced by GPS, which
provides sole means of navigation in revenue service.
       The Trimble-equipped Evergreen B747 flew the first around the
world flight using only GPS for navigation, departing JFK on
December 22 and returning on December 25. "In many of these cases
throughout the world, navigation and communications facilities fall
short of modern standards," said Peter Russo, Flight Captain for
Evergreen. "The airlines sees the accuracy of GPS, transportable
anywhere on the globe, as a big investment in flight safety, which
will yield both economic and performance quality dividends for
decades to come."
       Commenting on the specific operational benefits of GPS, Russo
added, the new GPS equipment "improves navigational accuracy and
thus reduces the cost of freight transportation for our customers.
Secondly, GPS allows Evergreen to participate in advanced oceanic
navigation routes requiring high precision to sequence aircraft more
efficiently. Lastly, the cost of GPS will be immediately recouped by
the avoidance of INS repair and replacement costs."

NEW SKYBLAZER XL GPS NAVIGATOR OFFERED BY MAGELLAN

       Magellan has upgraded its SkyBlazer line by increasing the
number of pixels in its new XL GPS Navigator to more than 20,000,
providing ultra-high resolution for its moving map display. This
gives pilots a more detailed, sharper picture of where they are and
where they're going, according to Marc Henegar, Marketing and Sales
Manager of Magellan's Aviation Products Marketing group. "With finer
detail, screen clutter is significantly reduced and the image is
crystal clear, which greatly benefits the pilot's situational
awareness."
       The unit will also display the location of all airports with
1,500 ft or longer runways, nav aids, intersections, special use
airspace, user waypoints, airport diagrams, airspace boundaries,
track history and courseline, and a Track Situation Indicator, which
combines a CDI and glideslope to facilitate en route and vertical
navigation. The moving map scale can be adjusted to allow scanning
of the map ahead, behind, or to the left or right of current
position. The unit includes a PC-updatable Jeppesen database of
North and Central America.
       The SkyBlazer XL measures 6.1"x3.5"x1.3", weighs 14 ounces,
and is powered by three AA batteries. It lists for $699.

COLLINS ANNOUNCES NEW FAMILY OF FLAT PANEL DISPLAYS

       Collins has launched a program to provide a family of state-
of-the-art liquid crystal displays for retrofit on existing airline
fleets. Designated the 5ATI display, the unit will replace existing
FD-108, FD-109, and FD-110 electro-mechanical instruments. Collins
claims the new unit will also provide the additional functionality
needed by airlines for operation in the evolving CNS/ATM
environment.
       "To meet this requirement we've developed a family of 'drop-
in' products designed to meet multiple market requirements and
retrofit applications," according to Clay Jones, VP and GM of the
Collins Air Transport Division.  The 5ATI retrofit family will be
TSOd in about August 1996, per Collins, and will provide format
flexibility to permit easy transition for flight crews, with minimal
training needed to master the added functionality selected by the
airlines.
       Based on experience and technology from the B777 program,
Collins has developed the 5ATI display. It has a larger active area
than current displays, 4.2" x 4.2", and uses a proprietary
technology that enables viewing angles of up to +/-60 degrees. It
has a nominal MTBF of 12,000, roughly four times greater than
today's electro-mechanical instruments. Acquisition cost is
estimated by Collins to be about 50% of that of current displays.
The unit is capable of future expansion to include weather radar,
TCAS, and GPS navigation.

FAA SEEKS INFORMATION ON REPLACEMENT AIR-GROUND RADIO FOR FUTURE
ACQUISITION

       The FAA has sent out a request for information in support of
a new program, the Next Generation Air/Ground Communications
(Nex_Gen_A/G) program, to replace the air-to-ground system currently
used for voice communications between pilots and air traffic
controllers. FAA hopes to learn of the existence of a system that
is off-the-shelf and based on existing technology, rather than be
forced to develop a system to meet its specific needs. This RFI is
part of a market survey to determine what products and technologies
are currently available, what developmental activities are under
way, and what products/technologies are expected to be available
within the next five years.
       The system FAA seeks must be capable of:
       *  ensuring that available RF spectrum can be used efficiently
for voice and data requirements;
       *  reducing susceptibility to RFI;
       *  improving communications system security;
       *  supporting remote maintenance monitoring; and
       *  providing consistent voice quality over a range of
operating conditions.
       The new system is expected to incorporate a multi-mode VHF
radio using digital modulation and TDMA to provide a flexible mix
of 25 kHz-separated voice and data channels. It should also be
backwards compatible with existing AM radios. Interested parties
should contact Mr. Ed Cornell, Product Engineer, at 202-358-5206,
before January 31, 1996.

ASM MAKES ITS MARK IN GPS COMMERCIAL AVIATION INTEGRATION

       In the world of aviation, where profit margins are slim and
retrofitting older aircraft with new equipment can have a healthy
effect on the bottom line, a small Texas company seems to have
found a niche in the business of integrating avionics into jet
aircraft.
       Aircraft Systems & Manufacturing (ASM), based in Georgetown,
Texas, near Austin, is working to develop a standard for the
integration of global positioning system (GPS) equipment and other
avionics into the cockpits of commercial airliners.
       "There are a lot of varying [integration] packages," says ASM
President Dan McKenzie. "We want to come up with a universal design
that [can equip] Airbus, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas and Boeing
aircraft."
       Founded in 1987, the company now employs 30 people, and has
contracts worldwide. Although it has looked into all kinds of
aircraft, including the business jet and general aviation (GA)
markets, ASM plans to keep integrating GPS systems into the higher-
end commercial aircraft. 
       "We are concentrating on the 15,000 commercial aircraft in the
United States," McKenzie says. "There is a 4-6 percent drop in the
number of aircraft each year due to aircraft age. We are stronger
domestically, so we are going to aggressively target this market."
       Among the company's projects is the updating of the cockpits
of about 140 Northwest Airlines DC-9s. Just last week, the company
got FAA supplemental type certification to integrate Honeywell-
Trimble's HT 9000 GPS equipment into 16 Boeing 727s owned by Guam-
based Continental Micronesia.
       Although ASM is concentrating on U.S. commercial aviation
markets, the world beckons. For example, a meeting late last year
between Federal Aviation Administration officials and members of the
Gulf Cooperation Council met to discuss GPS use in the Persian Gulf
region could spur GPS integration activities there. The company
recently installed a satcom system on a Boeing 747 belonging to a
Gulf nation head of state, says Marnie Sablan, ASM's corporate
communications manager.
       The company also plans to market its integration kits to
government agencies, including the military. "We've performed
integration for the U.S. Customs Agency. For us to look at the
military market, we would have to assess their design criteria,"
McKenzie says.
       Although McKenzie admits the company does not offer the lowest
cost GPS integration kit, he says buyers can tell the difference
between ASM's and the other brands. "Some outfits are calling a few
connectors, cables and a tray and are calling it a kit. It's a huge
ambiguity that is reflected in cost," he says. "Sometimes the time
it takes to integrate kits cramps the styles of maintenance
managers. We think we are unique in that we are not reactionary [to
the market]. We have conducted enough research to know that
[aviation managers] do not want to integrate [GPS without]
unnecessary cost."
       McKenzie says aircraft manufacturers' decision-makers must
weigh cost vs. value. "The guy making the decision to buy [GPS
integration kits] has to evaluate the cost and the ability of a
company," he says. "They have to evaluate all of the elements --
the kit, the ability to stick it into any airplane."
       To speed the installation, ASM provides its customers with
three dimensional computer-developed designs. Later this year the
company hopes to begin providing information to customers on-line,
Sablan says. That, she says, would make it easy to provide updates
and changes to integration information.
       A key to the company's GPS integration success, says Leonard
Olson, ASM vice president of operations, is its ability to customize
its kits to an aircraft. That cuts integration time, in some cases
drastically. "Some integration companies take upwards of six months
to [integrate GPS]," Olson says. "We are almost to the point that
we can take any GPS design package and integrate it in a couple of
days."

CANADA SIGNS AGREEMENT TO PRIVATIZE AIR NAVIGATION SERVICES

     Canada's air traffic control system will be run on a privatized,
not-for-profit basis beginning April 1 under an agreement in principle
signed by Canada and Nav Canada, the government air traffic control
agency, late last month. 
     The transaction, which will cost Nav Canada C$1.5 billion, is
part of the government's on-going privatization effort. The agreement
is subject to approval by Canada's parliament.
     Some 6,400 federal employees will be transferred to Nav Canada,
which will maintain the same pay, benefits, working conditions and
seniority as under the government. 
     Nav Canada will establish internal safety procedures, while
Transport Canada, the country's safety board, will establish
regulations for the privatized Nav Canada and will monitor its
operations to ensure compliance. 
     The company will also assume various obligations, including
restructuring costs associated with the transfer of authority, all
costs related to the completion of existing capital projects and costs
associated with implementing efficiencies in the operation and
management of air navigation systems.
     Nav Canada will derive its revenue from a transitional period
payment agreement, overflight fees implemented last month, and oceanic
fees for services provided by the company over the North Atlantic. The
last is provided for under terms of an international agreement.

USAIR TAKES ON VALUJET AT WASHINGTON DULLES

     USAir began late last month adding new service and departures
from Washington Dulles International Airport in a move that challenges
ValuJet Airlines and United Airlines in several East Coast city-pairs.
     USAir has added flights from Dulles to Boston, Columbus, Ohio,
and Orlando, Tampa and West Palm Beach -- most of which are ValuJet
city pairs. "We are increasing our daily departures from Dulles
airport by approximately 33 percent, adding nearly 41 percent more
seat capacity," says     Robert Fornaro, USAir senior vice president
of planning. Until this announcement, ValuJet was the only carrier to
fly the Dulles-West Palm Beach route.
     In January, USAir will begin Dulles-Tampa service and, in
February, increase Dulles-Boston service. ValuJet has had Washington
Dulles as a focus city and recently named Boston and Orlando its new
focus cities. By February, USAir says it and USAir Express will
operate 34 daily flights from Dulles, 164 flights from Washington
National Airport and 195 flights from Baltimore-Washington
International Airport.

MIDWEST EXPRESS CONTINUES EXPANSION

     Milwaukee, Wis.-based Midwest Express acquired two McDonnell
Douglas DC-9-32 aircraft previously operated by Garuda Indonesia. The
aircraft are being acquired through Australian Aircraft Sales of
Sydney, Australia. The aircraft are low-cycle models manufactured in
1979.
     The aircraft acquisition "is part of our ongoing strategy of
controlled and profitable growth," says Tim Hoeksema, president of the
airline, which recently split from its parent company, Kimberly-Clark
Corp. so it could be free to grow and become a public firm.
     The aircraft were added to Midwest Express' fleet last month and
will enter revenue service in April and May 1996. The aircraft also
will be hush-kitted to comply with Stage III noise requirements.
     The new planes give Midwest Express's  fleet of 21 aircraft, 19
of which are DC-9s. Service between Milwaukee and Boston, Dallas/Fort
Worth and Philadelphia will be expanded using one of the new
airframes, while the second will go to the airline's charter business.
     Midwest Express now serves 22 major business destinations
throughout the U.S. and Canada.

AIR SOUTH TO START BUSINESS-CLASS SECTION; EXPANDS TO FLORIDA

     South Carolina-based start-up Air South will implement a
business-class `club' section in its aircraft, looking for an upgraded
fare in a low-cost market. The airline also will start new service to
several southern U.S. destinations, mostly in Florida.
     Air South Chief Financial Officer Tom Volz says the carrier will
charge $20 extra for an "up-front club section" seat and, at the same
time, will eliminate "lounge areas" it has had on its six Boeing 737s-
200s.



Air South
Start-up Funding
($ millions)

S.C. Grants*      $3.0
Grant-training*   $1.1
Guaranteed debt  $12.0
Equity            $3.5
**********************
Total            $19.6

* Training and grants came from the city of Columbia, S.C., 
and Lexington and Richland Counties.



     The airline has lowered costs from 14 cents per seat mile when it
first flew last year to about 8 cents. It costs Air South 8.3 cents
per seat mile to fly a 250-mile segment, Volz says.
     The airline is expanding southward, mostly to the new focus area
of both Southwest Airlines and ValuJet Airlines: Florida. Air South
will soon start non-stop service from South Carolina to Atlanta,
Raleigh-Durham, Jacksonville and Myrtle Beach. New one-stops are
planned to Miami, Tallahassee and Tampa-St. Petersburg. 
     Air South executes a "hub-bypass strategy," says Volz, where the
airline, for example, bypasses its Atlanta hub. The airline also will
go ticketless early in 1996 and expand into larger markets, including
Chicago, Florida, New York and Washington.
     "We have to be at least 11 units [aircraft] to realize advantages
of scale," says Volz, pointing to the carrier's need for five more
737s.
     Volz also says Air South, which received substantial assistance
from the state of South Carolina, has put $12 million back into the
state's economy in 1995.

AIRTRAN AIRWAYS ACQUIRES TENTH 737-200

     Orlando-based AirTran Airways has signed a letter of intent to
lease a tenth Boeing 737-200 from Interlease Aviation. The airline
will use the airplane to inaugurate new service from Orlando to
Akron/Canton, Ohio, Allentown, Pa., and Rochester, N.Y., on Feb. 1.
     With the new service AirTran Airways will serve 20 U.S. points.
"As we obtain additional aircraft," says President John Horn, "we plan
to continue to expand our low-fare route system from Orlando."
     The tenth airplane will be configured to 126 seats and powered by
Pratt & Whitney JT8D-15 powerplants, which also will be hushkitted.
AirTran has not yet taken delivery of its eighth and ninth aircraft.

EL PASO FEE HIKES CAUSE SOUTHWEST TO INCREASE LONG-HAUL FLYING...

     A decision by El Paso, Texas, airport officials to quadruple
landing fees is having the unintended consequence of creating new
headaches for airlines competing against Southwest Airlines.
     Southwest said last month it will eliminate some services that
have connected through El Paso from origin points such as Houston and
San Antonio and create new non-stop services to the west coast.
     The new Houston-Las Vegas and San Antonio-Los Angeles services
represent a competitive threat to Continental Airlines, which operates
Houston-Las Vegas service from Intercontinental Airport. Southwest's
service will originate from Houston Hobby Airport. Continental
operates a competitive non-stop, point-to-point service between San
Antonio and Los Angeles, a Continental spokesman says.
     Bill Owen, a schedule planner for Southwest, says, "It simply was
no longer feasible for us to fly those flights through El Paso," he
says. "Our San Antonio-LAX service had always been a one-stop through
El Paso."
     Southwest now has the greatest number of departures from Las
Vegas, and Owen says it will begin a small additional service next
year. "It's just a bottomless pit for making money there," he says.
"It really is a rapidly growing city."

  ...WHILE LAX RAISES EYEBROWS BY DROPPING PFCs

     Los Angeles International Airport has decided to stop collecting
a $3 passenger facility charge beginning Jan. 1, becoming the first
airport to voluntarily discontinue the charge. The move surprised some
industry observers, but appears to be an isolated event, since the
airport is holding open the option of applying for future PFC funding.
     "Nearly 54 million southern Californians and others traveling
from LAX will save approximately $60 million annually with the
passenger facility charge removed from their tickets," says John
Driscoll, executive director of the Los Angeles Department of
Airports. "LAX is the first airport in the nation to discontinue
collecting PFCs," he emphasized.
     The airport has stopped collecting the fee, says deputy executive
director Jerald Lee, because it has collected $158 million and it is
running out of time to spend the money. For instance, the FAA's
deadline for using funds collected for a proposed people mover system
run out next spring, but the airport is reconsidering the program
altogether. Instead, the airport is trying to redirect the funds to a
terminal project at Ontario Airport, which is under review by airlines
and the FAA. 
     LAX likely will pursue PFC collections in the future since it is
considering some $2 billion in renovations. "I don't think that there's
any question that we will" reapply for PFC collection, says Lee.
     Some industry observers see other motives in LAX's action. Peter
Bianchini, an analyst for Standard & Poor's, says LAX's decision "is a
continued step in [the] direction to separate LAX from [revenue
diversion regulations of] the federal government." He explains that
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has supported diversion of airport
revenue into city coffers to be used for non-airport projects,
something that is currently disallowed under federal laws governing
PFCs. So LAX will simply stop collecting the PFCs, Bianchini suggests,
to avoid the associated federal regulations.

THE AVRO RJ - PART V

(Editor's Note: This is the next of a series reviewing the BAe 146 and
its derivative, the Avro RJ. Paul Leighton, editor of sister-
publication Aircraft Value News, reviews the customer list of the 146
and RJ family.)
     The 1995 list prices of the Avro range are, according to Avro,
$20.6 million for the RJ70, $25 million for the RJ85, $28.4 million
for the RJ100 and $29.7 million for the yet-to-be-ordered RJ115. 
   In some cases, the manufacturer may actually receive such amounts
if the customer relies on BAe to provide finance. But for most
customers, the competition between regional jet manufacturers is such
that transaction prices are probably much lower. To date, there have
been few small orders. Those buyers ordering more than two likely
secured a reasonable discount. 
     Crossair, for example, is unlikely to have paid anything like
$28.4 million each for the 10 RJ100s it ordered. Similarly, the 23
orders placed by Sabena probably received a discount of at least 20%.
Avro tends to provide realistic quotes of order value. For example,
Avianca placed a further order for a single RJ100 example that Avro
quoted as being worth $25 million.
     The competition is intense among regional aircraft manufacturers,
with the U.S. dollar's depreciation particularly crippling for non-
U.S. manufacturers at present. Fokker has in the past been forced to
sell aircraft at less than cost. Both Fokker and BAe have made it
clear that they intend to reduce costs in the coming years. BAe has
moved production of the RJ wings from Avro in the U.S. back to BAe in
the UK to better manage its costs and reduce the sum of dollar-based
components. But the burden of further cost-reduction can be expected to
fall on suppliers, given that BAe has already undertaken considerable
cuts. It would appear that, if the price of new aircraft remains stable
or even falls, used values will decline. 
     The RJ has been in service for less than two years and all RJs
remain with the original customers, although Avro has leased out some
for short periods. There has thus been no market indication of used RJ
values. With deliveries just starting in quantity and in view of the
quality of most customers, few if any RJs are likely to be available
soon. 
     The problems of Business Express, which operates three RJ70s,
suggest that, in the event no further deliveries are made, the existing
RJ fleet will have to be eliminated. Avro will work hard to ensure that
the balance of nine units is delivered within a reasonable time and that
the three already in service remain so for the next few years. Failure
to do so would raise the possibility that the RJ will be viewed in the
same way as its predecessor.
(Next week: BAe 146 and Avro RJ values)

MANX AND LOGANAIR TO RATIONALISE OPERATIONS

      Airlines of Britain Holdings -- owner of British Midland
Airways, Manx Airlines, Manx Airlines Europe and Loganair -- will
rationalise the regional airline operations of the latter three
companies following a decision by group Chairman Sir Michael Bishop
shortly before Christmas. The move comes as Isle of Man-based commuter
operator Manx Airlines is expecting to see continued recovery in 1996
after losses in 1994. 
      In an interview with C/R News International, Manx Airlines
Commercial Director Mike Bathgate said that since Loganair and Manx
Airlines Europe both fly as British Airways Express franchisees, it
makes sense to rationalise operations with those of Manx Airlines.
Effective 1 January, the three airlines' operations will be managed by
a single Manx Airlines management team. Glasgow-based Loganair will
continue to trade in its own name under the leadership of Managing
Director Scott Grier.

Job Losses at Loganair 

      Bathgate said there will "probably" be some Loganair job losses
in Scotland "on the accounting side," but this will depend on how many
staff relocate. He claimed that there will be no visible change to
operations, although rationalisation of routes and equipment will be
decided in the coming weeks ahead of the resumption of a summer
schedule in the second quarter of 1996.
      During 1994, Manx Airlines plunged into heavy losses of several
millions of pounds following its takeover of much of the Loganair
operation. Manx increased in size by more than 80%, as 11 aircraft and
40 routes were added. In 1995, the airline established its franchise
agreement with BA, which had begun under Scott Grier as he prepared to
lead a Loganair management buyout from Airlines of Britain. That move
subsequently did not proceed, with Bishop instead retaining Loganair
as a smaller element of the group.
      Now the airline's fortunes have been reversed, says Manx
Managing Director Terry Liddiard.  "In 1995 we have turned [the loss]
round completely, and expect a healthy profit," he told a staff sales
and marketing conference. Liddiard attributed the airline's improved
status to strict control of costs, revenue growth and the efforts of
Manx's 850 staff. Goals set for 1996 include improved punctuality,
better handling of customer complaints, and "the best planned service
recovery in any situation."

BRITISH MIDLAND EYES LONGER ROUTES; WILL ABANDON DC-9s

      British Midland, with 100 flights daily from London Heathrow,
is looking to extend the profits it has realized from successful code-
sharing arrangements by starting new service that could make the
carrier a much larger force in Europe.

Source: British Midland



    The airline, which code-shares with American Airlines, United
Airlines and Virgin Atlantic, is examining several new destinations
from Heathrow, including Rome, Madrid, Cairo, Warsaw and Budapest, an
industry source says. The longer-haul routes could be flown with
excess SAS aircraft, possibly even Boeing 767s. SAS owns 40% of
British Midland and already has subleased eight 737-500s to the
carrier.
    The second-largest carrier in the U.K., British Midland also plans
to eliminate three McDonnell Douglas DC-9s from its fleet during the
next 18 months as it adds new 737-500s and Fokker 70s. 
     The carrier now has a fleet of 36 aircraft, including 22 newer
737s. By April 1996, it will get rid of its oldest aircraft, a DC-9-10
that was the sixth DC-9 ever made, delivered in 1965. The aircraft is
under lease from Ansett Worldwide Aviation. By 1997, British Midland
plans to cast off three DC-30s leased by Electra Aviation. During that
time it will take delivery of additional 737s and F70s. 
    Once the DC-9s are gone, British Midland's fleet will have an
average age of about four years. The carrier has used a strategy of
starting up a route with smaller aircraft, such as a 737-500 or a
Fokker 70, and then switching to larger aircraft when the route
becomes more profitable. 
    British Midland recently began what it claims is the first
reservations booking service with payment made on the Internet. The
new system, called CyberSeat, is aimed at the 50 million Internet
users, a figure British Midland says is growing 10% per month.
CyberSeat still allows travel agent pickup for tickets.

SCOTTISH REGIONAL AIRPORTS REEL FROM SEVERE WEATHER 

    The worst winter weather in years struck island airports off the
north coast of Scotland late last month, closing some as a result of
combined high wind, snow and ice. Severe conditions were aggravated by
record low temperatures, although some regional services were expected
to resume 28 December to Shetland Island airport at Sumburgh after a
four-day break. Sumburgh is the region's most important airport,
supporting a series of inter-island operations, scheduled services to
the mainland and continuous flights connected with offshore energy
shuttles. 
    Snow drifts as much as 30 feet deep were reported on Shetland, as
gale force winds drove some of the worst blizzards seen on the island.
Sumburgh Airport closed on Christmas Eve and even as scheduled
operations were due to resume late last week, more bad weather was
being forecast for the region. The cold conditions were felt farther
south on the Scottish mainland with Glasgow reporting temperatures as
low as -18 degrees Centigrade and with nighttime temperatures set to
fall as low as -22 C.
    Loganair, which operates as British Airways Express, told C/R News
International that along with being unable to fly to Sumburgh,
operations to Lerwick were being interrupted by heavy snow. It also
had to abandon a flight to Donegal, Ireland, because of bad weather,
instead diverting at least one service to Londonderry. 
    Aberdeen-based Business Air told C/R News International that its
services to Sumburgh via Inverness had also been hit by airport
closures and air traffic control delays, although services resumed 28
December. 
    Highland and Islands Airports (HIA), which manages Sumburgh and
Inverness airports and the aerodromes at Benbecula, Islay, Kirkwall,
Stornoway, Tiree and Wick, told C/R News International that all the
region's airports had been affected by the winter weather. The
principal problem has been ice rather than deep snow, although it
reported up to 3 feet of snow on Sumburgh's airport ramps. 
    As much as an inch of solid ice has built up on runways at all of
the island airports as melted snow has frozen. This has constituted a
major problem for Sumburgh, since the Shetland Isle airport relies
upon the delivery, by road, of de-icing agents from Lerwick; it was
still cut off on 28 December. HIA reported that conditions were so bad
that a fully loaded British Aerospace ATP flown by British Airways
could not operate into Stornoway on the island of Harris in the Outer
Hebrides. With the threat of continuing severe conditions, HIA
concluded that the region's airports "could cope," but conceded that
the "unusual ice problem" was the greatest factor influencing
continued air connections to the mainland of Scotland.

TYROLEAN AIR CONVERTS FOKKER 70 OPTION TO ORDER, ADDS TWO OPTIONS

    Tyrolean Airways picked up one of its three options on the Fokker
70 and added two more options 22 December. 
    The airline now has four firm orders and four options on the
regional jet. The newest Fokker 70 -- in a 80-seat, single-class
configuration -- will be delivered in August.
    The order is seen as a boost in confidence for the type. Tyrolean
shareholder Austrian Airlines boosted its own Fokker 70 fleet from
four to seven late last month (C/R News International 25 December
1995,).
    This recent transaction puts the Fokker 70 order book at 71
orders. Total orders for the JetLine family, which includes the Fokker
70 and the Fokker 100, now total 361.

MD-95 PRODUCTION WILL NOT BEGIN FOR AT `AT LEAST A YEAR'

    It will be "at least a year" before production begins on the MD-
95, McDonnell Douglas spokesman Don Hansen says. The program is just
getting under way following the big ValuJet Airline order, and design
work must be completed, Hansen says (C/R News International, 30
October 1995, p. 8). A total of $200  million has been allocated for
non-recurring development costs, says Executive Vice President John
Wolf. Work will be done at Asia-Pacific subcontractors Halla
Engineering and Heavy Industries Ltd. of South Korea, Korean Air's
Aerospace Division and Japan's ShinMaywa Industries.

ICAO PREDICTS WORLD AIRLINE TRAFFIC UP 7% IN '95

    The world's airlines will have carried more than 1.3 billion
passengers in 1995, up 5% over the 1.2 billion carried in 1994, the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) predicts. In
addition, 21.6 million tons of freight will have been transported, up
8% over 1994. The data indicate a continuing recovery of the world
airline industry and the likelihood of record traffic growth in 1996.
    ICAO estimated that airlines will have flown 2.2 trillion revenue
passenger kilometers (RPKs), an increase of 7% over the 2.1 trillion
flown in 1994. Capacity, based on available seat kilometers (ASKs),
will have risen 6%, to approximately 3.3 trillion, and average
passenger load factor will rise 1 point to 67% worldwide.

EUROPEAN AIRPORTS, AIRLINES PUT SPIN ON EU GROUND HANDLING DECISION

    While airport officials are generally pleased with the European
Union's recent compromise on ground services liberalization, they are
concerned that some provisions will slow or even reduce the trend
toward commercialization and autonomy of European airports. 
    The EU's directive last month [see box at right] marks the end of
a long debate between airlines and airports over ground-handling
rights, for the time being at least. Monopolies on ground handling
services are maintained by some European airports, while airlines
enjoy monopolies at other airports. There is limited and open
competition at still other airports.
    European airlines began lodging complaints against airport
monopolies with the EU as far back as 1991, and their actions were
responsible in part for the formulation of recommendations for the EU
directive. The airlines' recommendations were more far-reaching in
their attempts to foster competition.
    The EU's directive allows exemptions for airports that are either
too small or congested to immediately accommodate competition, and
delays until 2003 liberalization at many of Europe's largest airports.
It also allows airports to charge a concessions fee to third-party
ground handling companies.
    The directive is a "substantial improvement" over earlier
proposals, says Sheena Gibson, head of the European Policy Unit for
Airports Council International - Europe (ACI). But the Association of
European Airlines decried the EU's directive.
    Le Thi Mai, general manager for environment and infrastructure at
AEA, says it was not happy with the "watered down" directive. The
eight-year waiting period before complete liberalization of ground
handling services is too long, she says.
    What concerns ACI is its conviction that the introduction of
third-party competition for baggage and passenger handling, catering
and fueling services infringes upon the rights of privatized, self-
financed airports to make important financial decisions about their
own operations. There seems little doubt that the proposal will
negatively affect the finances of some airports that rely heavily on
ground handling for revenue.
    Le Thi Mai makes the case that the EU's protection of airport
ground handling monopolies until 2003 is a form of "regulatory" state
aid that undercuts the argument that these airports are truly 
privatized. The directive actually favors airport monopolies, AEA
argues, which under certain circumstances will be allowed to exist
after 2003. Monopolies enjoyed by airlines, however, will be
dismantled under the directive, AEA contends.  
    AEA cites Olympic Airlines' monopoly at Athens Airport as an
example. Olympic will have to relinquish its monopoly before 1999 and
compete for ground-handling rights with other parties. Yet some
airports, such as Frankfurt, will be able to retain their monopolies
until 2003. "I don't like monopolies held by airports or airlines," Le
Thi Mai explains. But if airports are allowed to maintain their
current monopolies, then airlines should also, she argues.
    On the other hand, ACI feels the EU's proposal for "unlimited
[airline] self-handling" will create new monopolies, the very
situation the EU is trying to prevent, says Gibson. Large airlines at
smaller airports will so dominate ground handling, that the EU's
directive is tantamount to reducing competition, she explains. Robert
Payne, Frankfurt Airport's spokesman, agrees. Larger airlines "are
positioned to leverage themselves and to have competitive advantage
over other groups," he says. 

Space Constraints, Efficiency Drew Concern of Airports' Concern 

    ACI is also concerned about space constraints at airports --
Frankfurt being the prime example -- where there is little or no room
to accommodate new competitors. The financial cost of creating this
extra space "would be horrendous," says Kelly, not to mention the
political cost from environmental protests against expansion.
Frankfurt Airport may have to sacrifice some of its aircraft parking
space in order to accommodate new ground handlers, Payne indicates. 
    Loss of aircraft parking space presents another issue: disruption
of airport operations. Payne says Frankfurt is "concerned about being
able to maintain [its] levels of efficiency and capacity," which he
believes are optimized by having only one ramp handler. Frankfurt's
efforts to maintain a 45-minute maximum for traffic transferring at
the facility may be jeopardized by the new EU rules, as well. Jacques
Reder, spokesman for Aeroports de Paris, operator of Paris' two main
airports, says it would be "impossible" to accommodate more than the
two handlers already at each airport because of ramp congestion. 
    Le Thi Mai questions why Frankfurt cannot achieve the efficiency
of an airport like Heathrow, where ground handling competition is
liberalized. Frankfurt, however, is more space-constrained than
Heathrow.
    Economies of scale will also be hurt by introducing new
competitors, says Payne, who points out that Frankfurt has not raised
its ground handling fees for a number of years. Airports also face a
loss of revenue if new companies are allowed to compete against
airport monopolies. Frankfurt accrues 38% of its revenue from ground
handling services, while Aeroports de Paris, operator of Paris
airports, generates 19%. ADP spokesman Jacques Reder says introduction
of a third ground handling company at either Orly or Charles de Gaulle
will have a negative effect on ADP's revenue, all of which is
reinvested in the airports.
    AEA counters with financial assessments researched by an
independent university. Airline ground handling costs would be at
least 30% lower at airports that offer competitive ground handling,
she says. These types of services cost European carriers between $2.3
billion and $2.5 billion in 1991, she explains. Extrapolated, airlines
could have saved as much as $750 million that year under a more
liberalized environment.

EU DELAYS FULL LIBERALIZATION OF GROUND HANDLING

    A final document detailing the EU's directive has not yet been
formed, but in general advocates allowing European airlines to offer
their own self-handling services in order to lower the cost of air
travel to airlines and passengers. Specifically, the EU says:
    *  airlines will be able to operate their own baggage handling by
1999. Airlines involved in alliances, however, will be precluded from
handling the baggage of other carriers unless they qualify as third-
party handlers.
    *  terminal and airside handling services will be open to third
party competition by 1 January, 1999, at airports that handle more
than 3 million passengers annually;
    *   airports handling more than 3 million passengers annually can
appeal for two-year exemptions in 1999 and 2001. There will be no
extensions granted after 2003.

DOWNSELECT LEAVES SH-2G AND LYNX TO COMPETE FOR RNZN HELO ORDER

    As expected, the results of the New Zealand Ministry of Defence's
downselect leave Kaman Aerospace and Westland Helicopters to compete
for the 
Royal New Zealand Navy's six-ship, $120-million helicopter
procurement.
    Eliminated in the downselect were Sikorsky Aircraft and Eurocopter.
    The competitors, informed of the result of the downselect last
month via a letter from the New Zealand Ministry of Defence, are to
submit best and final offers in late February.
    The outcome of the New Zealand downselect will likely extend beyond
the Royal New Zealand Navy's (RNZN) relatively small buy, because the
RNZN is cooperating with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), which also
has a requirement for medium helicopters. The result may also
influence Malaysia's naval helicopter procurement.
    The RAN plans to buy helicopters which can operate from its ANZAC-
class frigates and the proposed Offshore Patrol Combatant (OPC). The
request for tenders, issued in late October, calls for delivery of 14
helicopters for the frigates, with the possibility of an additional
nine aircraft for the OPCs.
    The value of the Australian contract is expected to be about $500
million.                                                                                                             
    Malaysia, which is jointly developing the OPCs with Australia, is
expected to buy at least six naval helicopters to replace its obsolete
Westland Wasps.
    Sales efforts by both Sikorsky and Eurocopter were made more
difficult by factors not related to the performance of the aircraft on
offer.
    Sikorsky's chances were widely seen to be diminished by problems
experienced by the Australian army's 39-ship Black Hawk fleet, which
included airframe cracks, corrosion problems and a lack of spares.
Sikorsky was reportedly offering a naval version of the S-76.
    Eurocopter would have been a difficult choice in New Zealand
because of opposition to the French government's ongoing nuclear
testing in the region.
    New Zealand will conduct a limited evaluation of the two
competitors while best and final offers are being processed. A
contract award is scheduled for April, following parliamentary
approval of the Defence Ministry's selection.
    For both the New Zealand and Australia competitions, Westland is
offering a Lynx variant. Kaman Aerospace [KAMNA], is offering the SH-
2G.

ATLANTA CONTRACT AWARD SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK

    Bids from helicopter operators pitching to fly air courier services
around Atlanta during this summer's Olympic Games are expected Jan. 8,
with the organizers hoping to make a decision by Jan. 12, says Chuck
Stancil of Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI).
    GTRI is acting as prime contractor on behalf of the Federal
Aviation Administration for the Atlanta Short Haul Transportation
System (ASTS), a demonstration project aimed at validating the use of
helicopter services in the Atlanta region during the Games.
    A bidder's conference, held Dec. 7, drew responses from five
operators, sources tell Helicopter News. They are: Air Logistics,
Petroleum Helicopters Inc., Evergreen, Era Aviation, and OmniFlight.
    Operators are being asked to commit to carriage of between 1.6
million and 1.9 million pounds of air freight during the 17-day
period. The Games begin on July 19.                                                                                  
    The freight--in the form of small overnight packages--is being
provided by a consortium of carriers including UPS, Federal Express
and the U.S. Postal Service. The carriers--who have formed into a
cooperative group for ASTS--will be subsidized on a 90 percent return
basis from the FAA for their participation in the project.
    The object of the program is to establish feedback from the
day-to-day business  operations "so we can show that helicopters make
economic sense in this type of environment," Stancil says. GRTI is
undertaking a major analysis of ASTS operations to establish a
baseline for "looking afresh" at helicopter transportation in an urban
environment.
    During the package carrying operations the helicopters will use a
communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) GPS/data link system
for flight following, dispatch and weather information contributed by
ARNAV Systems Inc., for the project.
    Of the five operators bidding, PHI recently signed up as a user of
similar equipment--ARNAV's System Six hardware. Whether this will give
the company an edge in the Atlanta competition is not clear.
    Meanwhile, Stancil dismissed some industry grumbling about what
Textron's announcement that it has become a sponsor of the Olympics
means, and will bring 19 Bell helicopters to the Games. "We had plenty
of warning this was happening, so we knew what to expect," Stancil
said. Some of the Bell machines will be fitted with the ARNAV
equipment "so they can, in effect, be part of the ASTS data collection
effort," he added.

V-22 EMD EFFORT ON COURSE FOR DECEMBER FIRST FLIGHT

    Current projections--backed up by actual parts flowing from
pre-production processes--show that the V-22 Osprey is now weighing
nearly 1,300 pounds under the empty weight figures specified in the
contract between the U.S. Navy and Bell Boeing, a 1995 year-end check
on progress shows. 
    "We have about 50 percent of the aircraft which is now 'actual'
parts with known weights," says Stuart Dodge, Director of the Joint
Program Office (JPO) in Washington, D.C. "They all conformed to our
predictions. It shows we have the weight projections nailed down."
    Dodge recently told JPO employees in a Christmas letter that the
weight savings have exceeded--by over a factor of two--the target
weights set by the Bell Boeing manufacturing team themselves.
    "It's directly related to the advanced production processes in use.
Put simply, they minimize errors and guarantee first time results,"
Dodge said in a follow-up interview with Helicopter News.
    Dodge--who credits pioneering work done with the Boeing 777
airliner with the production process success--says the first EMD
(Engineering, Manufacturing and Development) Osprey fuselage was
recently mated to its wing structure "with the tap of a rubber
mallet."
    This operation--which brought the Boeing Helicopters Div., fuselage
together with wings manufactured by Bell Helicopter Textron in
Arlington, Texas,--represented an important milestone for the project.
    "It qualified us to begin giving out advanced long-lead contracts
to vendors for the first Osprey production equipment items," he said.
    Go-ahead for the first, or low rate initial production (LRIP),
parts will follow the first flight of this aircraft set for December
of this year. It will be the seventh V-22, but the first built to
production-level specifications.
    "Everything hangs on meeting that [first flight] commitment," Dodge
said.
    The stakes are high. With this flight complete, the government will
formally begin the process of buying 523 V-22s it has contracted for
(425 for the Marine Corps, 48 for the Navy and 50 for the Special
Operations Command.)
    First deliveries--to the Marines--are set for 1999, Dodge said.
    Costs of the program show a similar story to the one on weight, he
said, with the first EMD aircraft now exhibiting a "recurring flyaway"
cost estimate of $32.5-million per aircraft. Dodge said this is on
track to meeting its the target price goal of $29.4-million (in FY '94
dollars.) A cost reduction program under assessment has the potential
of reducing this to $28.1 million.
    Costs will also be affected by an expected decision sometime this
year to buy Ospreys on an multi-year procurement (MYP) basis. The MYP
is expected to call for producing three aircraft per month, which
could reduce unit flyaway costs by as much as $3-million per aircraft,
Dodge said.

NAVY COMPLETES MH-53, MAGIC LANTERN INSTALLATION

    The Navy's Coastal Systems Command, Panama City, Fla., last month
completed installation and initial testing of the Magic Lantern
shallow water mine detection system onboard a MH-53 helicopter.
    The initial testing was successful, according to an industry
official. Magic Lantern is built by Kaman Aerospace. Further testing
of the MH-53/Magic Lantern will be conducted this summer.
    Once operational, Magic Lantern will be installed on Naval Reserve
SH-2G helicopters, based at Willow Grove, Pa. Kaman is working now on
integrating the system into the SH-2G, work which should be completed
by June. Previously, the system was used on the "F" model H-2.
    The Navy currently has two Magic Lantern systems and funding for a
third is provided for in DoD's FY '96 appropriations.
    Magic Lantern projects a blue-green laser into the water to locate
targets. The targets are recorded and sent back to the system for 
image and signal processing. An aided target recognizer (ATR),
essentially an intensive set of processing algorithms, is applied to
the image to establish details of the target's identification.
    The system was developed as an "in-house" research project at
Kaman, and an earlier version was deployed successfully during the
Gulf War.

MARINE CORPS FORESEES OSPREY, JAST AND RPV MIX

    A U.S. Marine Corps concept for a future air/ground task force
foresees employment of nearly 200 V-22 Ospreys as the mainstay of the
aviation element.
    The infantry-carrying version--the MV-22--will account for 120 of
the Ospreys. In addition, 36 will fly in the utility/observation role,
and a further 36 in the "attack" role.
    The plan, oriented well into the future, foresees the
package--known as a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF)--operating
the Ospreys alongside 140 Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST)
V/STOL aircraft. The MAGTF would also be supported by 42 heavy lift
helicopters, as well as 30 multi-purpose remotely piloted vehicles
(RPVs).
    This outline--which introduces two significantly new variants of
the V-22 into the planning process--is part of a new "alternate
structure" for the MAGTF being discussed in the new Sea Dragon
technology exploitation program announced by Marine Corps Commandant
Gen. Charles Krulak last month.
    In that initiative, the Corps will also pursue a major effort to
introduce automated--unmanned--rotary-wing craft into its aviation
structure.
    Col. Tony Wood, director of the Commandant's Warfighting Lab at
Quantico, Va., challenged industry to fly a 6,000 pound payload
unmanned helicopter in tests scheduled for February 1997.
    An outline of possible future force structure for the MAGTF
suggests that, in addition to the Ospreys, RPVs will play an
increasing role in resupply, observation and weapons targeting roles.

HELO PROGRAMS UNLIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY AUTHORIZATION BILL VETO

    Defense authorization conferees, after months of deadlock, wrapped
up work on their FY '96 defense bill Dec. 13, but the measure was
vetoed by President Clinton, who objects to Congress providing DoD
with $7 billion above the administration's request.
    Although the bill, which provides DoD with $264.7 billion in budget
authority and $262.1 billion in outlays, will undergo revision before
again going to the White House, major DoD helicopter programs are
unlikely to be affected by those revisions.
    Details of the authorization bill are below. See pages 4-5 for
complete details of appropriations for DoD helicopter and helicopter-
related programs.

HELICOPTER INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS TO WATCH IN 1996

         Here are our choices for the 10 most important developments to
watch for in the coming year, in no particular order. Some items that
almost made the list: an Army CH-47 upgrade program; the
revitalization of the domestic oil and gas industry and a long-term
vertical replenishment contract for the K-Max.

1.       Naval Helicopter Procurements in Australia and New Zealand. The
         focus in 1995 was attack helicopters in Europe. This year, the
         most closely watched naval competitions will be in the Pacific
         Rim. Again, the competition will include at least four airframes,
         but only two have a real chance, the Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprite
         and the Westland Super Lynx.

2.       Introduction of the Bell Boeing Civil Tiltrotor. Expect the V-22
         team to introduce an 11-place civil tiltrotor based on the XV-15
         concept demonstrator design. Assuming Bell and Boeing can work
         out the details, the announcement could come as early as Heli-
         Expo '95 in February. But smart money is on the project being
         revealed at NBAA in October.

3.       Industry Consolidation. Everyone says its coming. But that's what
         everybody said in 1995. The most likely scenario, nothing
         changes. The second most likely scenario: a combination of Boeing
         and McDonnell Douglas' helicopter units. If that fails, watch for
         Sikorksy to join the fray.

4.       Canadian Helicopter Buy. Another tight competition. Too early to
         pick a front-runner, but the winning bid needs to be long on
         creative financing.

5.       Approval of the Marine Corps' 4BN/4BW Plan. Gen. Bob Magnus, the
         Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Aviation says we should have
         a thumbs up or down this summer on the Corps' $2 billion
         Huey/Cobra modernization effort. 

6.       First Flight of an EMD V-22. More importantly, look for a debate-
         -and decision this summer--on accelerating production to 36
         aircraft per year.

7.       The Digitization of the U.S. Army's Helicopter Fleet. By the
         Army's rules, the initial lot of aircraft must be completed by
         mid-June for the Army's Force XXI trials.                           

8.       British Training Helicopter. Will the British throw the Europeans
         a bone, after buying American (the Apache and the C-130J) in
         1995? The contest is between Bell and Eurocopter, with Schweizer
         running on the outside.

9.       HAI and the Atlanta Olympic Games. HAI and the industry's best
         opportunity ever to prove the efficacy of the helicopter in the
         urban environment.

10.      A New Light Twin from Bell? Look for Bell, which quietly
         abandoned plans for a twin-engine version of the new 407, to
         launch a light twin to compete with the Eurocopter EC-135 and the
         MDHS Explorer.

     Again the big news is the disastrous decline of new turbine
helicopter sales to the U.S. based operators. After deducting new
turbine helicopters exported and new helicopters purchased for resale
from the FAA registered sale total of 161 units we are down to just 49
units for the U.S. operator. That's about one new helicopter a week
for what is supposed to be the largest commercial market in the world.

WINGS WEST TOPS AMERICAN EAGLE CARRIERS IN MOST PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES

   California-based American Eagle carrier Wings West held a slim
performance margin over other wholly owned American Eagle carriers in the
three-month period ended Sept. 30. According to DOT data, Wings West
recorded a completion factor of 95%, compared to 94% for Simmons and 91%
each for Command and Nashville Eagle. Load-factor was 57% compared to 56%
for Nashville Eagle, 52% for Simmons and 49% for Command. Simmons topped
the others in terms of traffic with 86.3 million revenue passenger miles.
That compared to 35.1 million for Nashville Eagle, 34 million for Wings
West and 26.7 million for Command.

NEW TRANSPORTATION "STRATEGY" LIKELY TO INCLUDE HIGHER USER FEES

   Increased aviation user taxes at state and local as well as federal
levels will be part of the foundation for a new national transportation
"strategy" being formulated by the Bush Administration. The strategy,
which also would allow increased access to U.S. markets by foreign
carriers, is to be released next month after the state of the union speech
and publication of the President's fiscal 1991 budget. In a speech to the
Transportation Research Board in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, Skinner said
the cost of shaping up the nation's transportation infrastructure over the
next 20 years could run from one to three trillion dollars and called for a
"stonger, healthier partnership among federal, state and local
governments."
   Such a partnership would be strengthened, Skinner added, by replacing
"rigid requirements with performance-related criteria in federal
transportation programs," including "additional regulatory flexibility and
policies that recognize the diversity of conditions and needs in the real
world." Such a healthier partnership "goes hand-in-hand with reduced
dependence on federal money. We believe federal recipients of federal
transportation aid should pay a larger share of project costs." Skinner
said that increasing the ante for state and local governments will "help
bring the principles of market competition to bear in our financing
programs" and "also strengthen state and local accountability for wise
transportation decisions." He said the government would be seeking new and
creative ways to "apply the time-tested user-fee principle."
   Directly from the users, Skinner said the government would seek to
recover "the maximum practical share of costs they impose. This includes
recovering federal costs from user groups that are now getting a free ride.
We also want to make it easier for other levels of government to levy user
fees for transportation improvements." Such moves would allow local
airport authorities to impose passenger facility charges (PFCs), or head
taxes, which is prohibited under current airport and airway funding
legislation. Hike from 8% to at least 10% is anticipated for the airline
passenger ticket tax as well as a four-cent increase in the levy on non-
commercial aviation fuel.

AOPA WOULD DUMP GROUND-BASED ATC SYSTEM IN FAVOR OF SATELLITES

   FAA should abandon its reliance on a ground-based air traffic control
system in favor of a satellite-based system using the growing Global
Positioning Satellites (GPS) network, AOPA President John Baker urged this
week. In a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Baker
charged that the National Airspace System Plan, the government's multi-
billion-dollar attempt to upgrade the National Airspace System, is behind
schedule and over budget. The charge drew an immediate response from DOT
Secretary Samuel Skinner, who called the U.S. ATC system "the safest in the
world." Conceding capacity problems due to demand exceeding supply,
Skinner added, "all you have to do isgo to Europe to find out what I am
talking about." Propelling 1950s technology into 1990 technology is
"time-consuming; it is state-of-the-art; it is expensive; and, it is
difficult...but I can assure you, that technology is right on target," he
declared.
   Baker said from original cost estimates of $11.4 billion in 1981, FAA is
now looking at a total cost of $25 billion to $27 billion to complete the
NAS improvements and is 10 years behind the original implementation
schedule. He called for a congressional investigation of the NAS Plan
effort, adding that "it doesn't make sense to move forward in that
direction (completing the current NAS Plan). We believe it's now time to
recast this program and move to the system of the future."
   Baker said a major portion of the GPS system, which was designed to
provide navigation and communication capabilities for use by the military,
is already in place, noting that 14 of the satellites in the 24-satellite
network are already in orbit and "are working phenomenally well." He said
that satellite network can provide guidance accurate enough for non-
precision and Category I approaches at a much lower cost than continuing
with all the elements of the current NAS Plan. An AOPA report found the 90
separate projects envisioned in the NAS Plan have now grown to 187 separate
projects. The report states that projects with an estimated cost of $7.14
billion to $10.8 billion could be eliminated or sharply reduced because
they will not be needed to implement or support a satellite-based control
system. Among the potential savings listed by AOPA are: $345 million for
control tower/TRACON modernization; $426 million for Air Route Traffic
Control Center modernization; $196 million in facilities and equipment
expenditures for the new Denver, Colo., airport and $111 million of planned
improvements in ATC system facilities and equipment in the area around
Dallas/Fort Worth Airport to support actual and forecast traffic growth;
$1.1 billion to implement the microwave landing system;over $1 billion for
terminal radar digitizing, replacement and establishment; $108 million to
sustain and relocate Automatic Surveillance Radar, and over $740 million
earmarked for long-range radar replacement and networking.

STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF FAIRCHILD AIRCRAFT CONTINUES

   Dispute over control of Fairchild Aircraft Corp. appeared to have been
settled out of court late Thursday, although the outcome was unclear at RAW
presstime. No principals in the dispute were available for comment.
According to RAW sources, however, company president William Cavanaugh and
VP Gene Morgan have regained access to the company's San Antonio plant. The
two officers were blocked from the premises by a Dec. 29 temporary
restraining order (TRO) obtained by attorneys representing new owner Carl
Albert, former chairman of American Eagle Wings West and a major Fairchild
customer (RAW, Dec. 22/461. There was to have been a court hearing on the
TRO in San Antonio Thursday morning, but parties for neither side showed
up. RAW has been unable to verify that Albert signed a contract with
certain members of the Fairchild board of directors to acquire the
outstanding note against the company held by the Sanwa Bank of Japan. The
note had financed the acquisition of the company from Fairchild Industries
by GMF Financial of Los Angeles in late 1987. Albert immediately sought
the TRO to prevent Cavanaugh and Morgan from causing "severe disruption to
the business operation" of Fairchild by "exercising powers previously held
as president and VP," according to court documents. Sources also indicate
that agreement has been reached between Albert, on the one hand, and
Cavanaugh and Morgan on the other, that would allow Albert's control of the
commany to proceed.

TWEXPRESS POCONO SHUTS DOWN; RETURN TO SERVICE SEEN UNLIKELY

   Financially troubled Pocono Airways, failing to recover from Chapter 11
bankruptcy since last March, has ceased operations. The TWExpress carrier
will not attempt toresume service. Carrier had been using eight of its own
commuter slots at New York Kennedy in addition to 11 air carrier slots
leased from TWA. The commuter slots will by acquired by TWA under
provisions of a bankruptcy reorganization plan approved last winter and
will be assigned to TWExpress carriers Metro Northeast and Jet Express. TWA
also is expected to assign its 11 jet slots to its remaining regional
partners, at least temporarily.
   Pocono, a unit of Dallas-based Phoenix Ventures, a corporate successor
to Air Florida, lost $3.5 million last year and President Dann Lewis said
the parent company had already loaned the carrier $5.5 million to offset
losses and to meet other requirements. "Unfortunately, after an evaluation
of operating performance and projections, it did not make a lot of sense to
keep the airline going," he added. The Avoca, Pa.-based carrier served 11
airports in five states, operating with nine leased Metro III aircraft on
90 scheduled daily flights. Destinations, In addition to New York Kennedy,
were Albany and Binghamton, N.Y.; Boston; Harrisburg, Philadelphia and
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Pa.; Providence, R.I.; Washington's Dulles and
National airports, and Norfolk, Va. Approximately 200 jobs were affected.
   Pocono filed for Chapter 11 protection and initially ceased operations
in mid-1988 when it lost its long-standing Allegheny Commuter relationship
with USAir. Reorganization hit a snag when its major creditor,
Northwestern Bank of Pennsylvania, feared that the proposed agreement with
TWA would give the larger carrier a unilateral right to buy the eight
Kennedy slots at any time. Under the final agreement TWA was given the
right to acquire the slots - Pocono's primary assets - only in case of
breach of contract and "in such a way as to give rise to a right of
termination by TWA."
   Lewis said the carrier's primary problem was its "very poor restrictive
agreement with TWA." He said the senior partner had approved overlapping
markets for former Brockway Air Metro Northeast, a unit of Dallas-based
Metro Airlines and the the primary beneficiary of the Pocono shutdown.
Metro is bringing in two additional Saab 340s, in addition to its existing
10, and also expects to increase its fleet of 11 Beech 1900s to 13. Metro
leases four TWA air carrier slots at Kennedy and expects to gain most of
those forfeited by Pocono.

ARSON SUSPECTED IN CHAUTAUQUA METRO III DESTRUCTION

   Fire destroyed a Chautauqua Airlines Fairchild Metro III early last
Thursday at Washington County Regional Airport, Hagerstown, Md. Local fire
inspectors suspect arson, according to carrier President Joel Hall.
Aircraft had arrived at about 10:30 p.m. from Pittsburgh the previous
evening for a scheduled eight-hour layover. The fire, which apparently was
set just inside the passenger door, was reported at 2:38 a.m. Value of the
19-passenger aircraft was placed at $2.3 million. Hall said there were no
known outside influences that possibly could have prompted the act. There
were no immediate suspects or motives.

AIR WISCONSIN TO RECEIVE FIRST BAE ATP NEXT WEEK

   United Express Air Wisconsin next week is expected to receive its first
64-passenger British Aerospace Advanced Turboprop (ATP), marking its
adoption of a higher-capacity strategy at its Chicago O'Hare and Washington
Dulles hubs. As the new ATPs arrive at Chicago, they will free up existing
50-passenger F27s for service at the Dulles hub, where they will replace
five remaining 36-passenger Shorts 360s. The first ATP is to begin service
at Chicago March 1 and the second March 15. The first F27 will begin
Dulles service March 15. Although Air Wisconsin's strategy was dictated by
a lack of additional slots at O'Hare, where American's acquisition of all
Continental Express Britt Airways slots had placed Air Wisconsin at a
disadvantage, the demise of United Express Presidential had added impetus
to development of the Dulles hub.
   Air Wisconsin was not equipped to step into most of the former
Presidential routes on a timely basis. California-based United Express
Westair Holdings was so equipped...and did. Although so far limiting its
activities to Part 135 operations with aircraft seating 30 or fewer
passengers, WestAir has left the door open to larger aircraft. Air
Wisconsin is expected to move decisively into those Dulles markets that can
support F27 aircraft as quickly as possible, although specific markets have
not been revealed.

METRO NORTHEAST TO ENTER WHITE PLAINS O&D MARKETS

   TWExpress Metro Northeast next month will jump into two lucrative White
Plains origin-and-destination markets traditionally prized by American
Eagle Command - Boston and Washington National. Command has dropped the
Washington market completely and has scaled back capacity in the Boston
market in favor of feeding American's developing New York Kennedy hub.
Metro will begin with seven daily roundtrips in the Boston market Feb. 1,
increasing to nine trips Feb. 15. Carrier President Doug Caldwell said
Metro acquired 22 White Plains slots from Command and that it hoped to
become dominant in the White Plains market.
   Carrier will initially operate two Washington National roundtrips, three
to Buffalo over Syracuse and two to Rochester. Primary aircraft in the new
service will be Saab 340s, of which Metro Northeast will shortly have 12.
Together with 13 Beech 1900s, the carrier will be offering 27 daily
departures at White Plains - well short of 52 Albany departures and 35
from second-place Binghamton. But Metro's role in the White Plains market
is considered significant in its strategy of growth. And, asserted
Caldwell, "We will try to maintain our dominance." USAir Express Henson
currently dominates the White Plains-Washington National market and Command
remains the primary carrier between White Plains and Boston with eight
weekday frequencies, followed by Delta Connection Business Express with
four.

STATESWEST TRIMS ANNUAL LOSS BY 37 PERCENT

   StatesWest Airlines reported a net loss of $2.7 million for the fiscal
year ended Sept. 30, a 37% reduction from the previous year's net loss of
$4.3 million. According to President Rudy Miller, the Phoenix-based
independent regional has made "significant strides" during the past year,
adding $6 million to its working capital through an exercise of its Series
B warrants. In addition, Miller said the carrier during the year
implemented cost-reduction measures, restructured its fleet by switching
from BAe Jetstream 31s to Beech 1900s, and increased fares in the second
half. Miller also said the carrier entered into or renewed joint-fare
agreements with nine major airlines, which increased load factors and
yields per revenue passenger mile, and originated service in several new
markets.
   Operating revenues during the fiscal year declined 6% to just under $5.6
million. Operating expenses were down 24.4% to $7.5 million, but non-
operating expenses were up 144.2% to $793,800. Traffic also dipped, but
load factor increased from 34.7% to 43.3%. Passenger boardings were down
2.5% to 104,057; available seat miles decreased 21% to 49.2 million; RPMs
declined slightly, to 21.3 million from 21.7 million. Unit costs stood at
15.2 cents per ASM compared with 15.9 cents in 1988. Miller said
Stateswest is "positioned to continue the favorable trend it established in
fiscal 1989 and plans to add its fifth and sixth (Beech 1900s) in the
spring." The company "is in a strong capital position at present and will
continue to explore expansion through acquisition or joint venture."

MESA TALKS WITH UNITED ARE PROGRESSING; FLEET PLANS REVEALED

   Talks are "progressing" between Mesa Airlines and United on Mesa's
assuming United Express status at the Denver hub. Acquisition by the
Farmington, N.M., regional of nearly all Aspen Airways routes and stations
in the Rocky Mountain area is contingent upon its gaining the United
affiliation (RAW, Dec. 29/470). Aspen owner Don Ringsby agreed to break up
his long-time regional carrier when he was unable to sell it as one unit;
California investor Burt Sugarman dropped his offer in October after the
management/employee/British Airways acquisition of United fell through.
Ringsby plans to sell his 10 Convair 580s and jet operation, including
leases on four BAe 146-100s and an exclusive United Express route between
Denver and Aspen, as separate units.
   Mesa founder and President Larry Risley said he sees no resistance to
the new relationship on the part of United and no reason the transition
cannot begin in early February rather than March 1, as originally stated.
By taking only the routes and stations, Risley is able to replace Aspen's
aging fleet of 10 Convair 580s, of which seven fly the schedules while
three are in reserve or maintenance, with a new fleet of 19- and 30-
passenger airplanes. He plans a $50 million investment that will include
11 Beech 1900s and four 30-passenger airplanes - either the Embraer
Brasilia or the Saab 340B with a 30-passenger configuration.
   Risley, who also is chairman of the Regional Airline Association, said
he has no intention of taking the United Express operation up to Part 121
status, under which aircraft with more than 30 passenger seats are
permitted, in the immediate future. Over the long term, however, he said
he is looking at the new 30-passenger-plus Dornier 328. To reach his
requirement for 11 1900s by June 1, when he hopes to complete the
transition, Risley will retain five older 1900Bs that were going to be
traded in on five new 1900Cs, the first of which has already been
delivered. Delivery of four new Brasilias or Saabs by June 1 is more
uncertain, and Risley said he may have to operate some used aircraft in the
interim.
   Contrary to an earlier report, Risley is not seeking to place his
existing Mesa Airlines structure under the United Express umbrella. The
New Mexico and Arizona operation, which feeds the Albuquerque and Phoenix
hubs, will remain an independent unit. Only those flights feeding United
at Denver will carry the United Express livery. "We have no plan to change
the existing Mesa structure." Nor, he added, is he interested in the
seasonal Denver-Aspen ski market, which will be retained, at least for the
time being, by Aspen owner Ringsby.
   There will be little difference between the management and support
structures of Mesa and United Express, however. Flight crews will be
cross-utilized by both systems and all United Express aircraft will flow
through the Mesa maintenance base at Farmington, which along with Colorado
Springs and Durango, Colo., are the three jointly served points. Mesa
hopes to hire up to 50 Aspen Convair pilots to help fill a requirement for
90 additional pilots to operate the new system. Beech 1900 pay, however,
will be half that of Convair pay, which is consistent with Aspen's current
Air Line Pilots Association contract for 19-passenger airplanes.
   Ringsby has said there are several prospective buyers for the Aspen jet
operation, one of which is believed to be WestAir Holdings, the Fresno,
Calif.-based United Express carrier thought to have been interested in the
entire Aspen operation. WestAir has expanded to the East Coast, however,
joining Air Wisconsin in feeding United's Washington Dulles hub (RAW, Dec.
15/455).

DISCOVERY, OPPONENTS GET EXTRA ROUNDS FOR SQUABBLE OVER NEW HAWAII SERVICE

   Opponents of Discovery Airways' planned intra-Hawaii service have made
the most of the extra rounds they have been given by DOT to attempt to
prevent the new entrant's operations, firing away at Discovery over
citizenship issues. Meanwhile, Discovery, hoping to begin service Feb. 1,
has taken delivery of its first BAe 146 aircraft and is responding to its
opponents. It claims Hawaiian and Aloha, in a kind of pre-emptive
strike, have been attempting to capture the market in advance of
Discovery's entry. The incumbents have dropped fares 22% for passengers
who purchase coupons by Jan. 15. DOT has proposed to find Discovery fit,
subject to several conditions (RAW, Dec. 29/474).
   In filings at DOT, Aloha, Hawaiian, Air Line Pilots Association and the
Machinists union said a hearing in the Discovery Airways proceeding that is
concerned solely with the issue of potential control of Discovery by Philip
Ho is far too limited. Other citizenship issues should be addressed, they
said, including Nansay Corporation's (a Japanese company) potential control
separate from Ho; the role of Franco Mancassola, an Italian citizen, and
the terms of the agreements between Discovery and British Aerospace, the
carrier's sole equipment supplier. Aloha contended DOT's show cause order
proposing to grant Discovery a certificate before resolving all citizenship
issues is "contrary to more than five decades of precedent."
    Hawaiian told DOT it recognized and shared the department's reluctance
to impede the free flow of capital across international boundaries, or
financing which is a straightforward loan transaction not providing for
foreign control. "However, it is abundantly clear that the
Nansay/Discovery relationship involves far more than a straightforward loan
transaction," Hawaiian said.
   ALPA said Ho's fiduciary obligations to Nansay Hawaii give Nansay
impermissible control over Discovery. Given that Ho's personal investment
in Discovery "is dwarfed by his employer's massive investment of up to $12
million, there can be little doubt that he will vote his stock to protect
Nansay's interests in the applicant." The Machinists union filed similar
comments.
   Discovery said none of the objectors had given valid reasons for further
delaying its application. Assertion of the opponents that DOT's order
proposing the fitness finding constitutes a radical departure from the
agency's long-held position on foreign control "is wholly unfounded,"
Discovery said. "In fact, the tight restrictions embodied in the order
will surely discourage even the most passive foreign invesment in domestic
air carriers." Discovery urged DOT immediately to grant oral authority to
advertise and promptly issue a final order so that operations may begin
Feb. 1 as scheduled "on a sound financial basis."

OREGON CONGRESSMAN SAYS MLS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM IS NECESSARY

   An Oregon congressman said the microwave landing system (MLS)
demonstration program is needed to determine how best to operate aircraft
in the future and that FAA erred in making a major policy announcement on
the system before an FAA/industry task force completes work on the program.
Rep. Denny Smith (R), in a letter to FAA Administrator James Busey, said
"making such a major policy pronouncement before the agency/industry task
force completes its work can only serve to send the wrong signal to the
participants." Describing a detailed ILS/MLS transition plan is "at best
premature and at worst calls into question the commitment of the FAA to
perform a thorough and impartial analysis of our traffic management
options," Smith said. For the demonstration to be effective, the
participants must be an "integral part" of the analysis, he said. "Finding
the best approach to manage our airspace in the next century will require
the contributions of many different players. We cannot circumvent this
process by trying to choose the answer before we have all the results at
our disposal."

AIR WISCONSIN, ATTENDANTS REACH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT ON NEW CONTRACT

   Negotiators representing Air Wisconsin's 150 flight attendants and the
carrier Friday reached a tentative agreement on an amended contract,
following over seven months of negotiations. Air Wisconsin's attendants
are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants. Terms of the
agreement were not disclosed pending ratification by the rank and file.
Members will vote by confidential mail ballots to be counted Jan. 30. The
two sides, deadlocked, had jointly filed for federal mediation on Oct. 12,
1989, and during the last three days of negotiations were assisted by a
federal mediator. The previous contract had become subject to amendment on
June 30, 1989, with negotiations beginning May 31, 1989.

Semantics appear to play a major role in the Bush Administration's espoused
switch from a National Transportation "Policy" to National Transportation
"Strategy." Major difference is that policies tend to be written in
concrete, while strategies can easily be changed. On the other hand, the
administration may need quick footwork to punch across increased aviation
user fees at the same time it is protecting an unobligated aviation
trust-fund surplus of more than $6.5 billion (see related story on page 10
of hardcopy of this issue).

Chairman Carl Albert - should it occur - is premised on Albert capturing a
major order from American Eagle for replacement Metro IIIs. In the
alternative, parts production alone for the existing Metro fleet is said to
be sufficient to keep the factory doors open. Possible sale of the parts
distribution function was one of the sparks resulting in the ouster of

ECHOSTAR LAUNCHES SATELLITE AND ACQUIRES ANOTHER DBS PERMIT

     Echostar last week launched its Lockheed Martin Echostar-1
satellite on Long March, 2nd consecutive success and major boost
for trouble-plagued Chinese rocket.  Echostar, headed by Chmn.-CEO
Charles Ergen, also announced plans to take over Direct Bcstg.
Satellite Corp. (DBSC) in return for cash or shares of Echostar
stock valued at $9.7 million, subject to FCC and SEC approvals. 
Echostar already owned 40% of DBSC, which has FCC licenses to build
2 DBS satellites with 22 channels.  Echostar has approval for 21
DBS transponders.  DBSC recently received extension of its
construction permit until Nov. 30, 1998 (SW Dec 11 p6).  Echostar
said it completed previously announced reorganization of operating
subsidiaries Dec. 22.  Action followed exercise of virtually all of
warrants to buy 3.7 million shares of Class A common, allowing
subsidiaries to become 100% owned instead of 95%, Echostar said.

     DBSC Chmn.-CEO Harley Radin said his slot at 61.5 degrees W is
exempt from new FCC "single spectrum cap" rule for DBS providers. 
Rule limits each company to single slot for full-continental U.S.
service.  Radin said DBSC satellite can serve West Coast from its
assigned slot but elevation angles are lower there, meaning that
potential for signal blockage from mountains or buildings is
greater.  That doesn't necessarily have adverse impact on business
case for slot, he said, because "what you lose in the west you gain
in the east."  In exempting 61.5 degrees slot from spectrum cap,
FCC said that "while it appears that nationwide service from that
location is a technical possibility, as a practical matter such
service would not be comparable to service from 101 degrees, 110
degrees or 119 degrees" because of increased probability of
interference in west.

     DBSC will become Echostar subsidiary, although role of Radin
in merged company hasn't been determined, Echostar spokeswoman
said.  Echostar had bought 40% of DBSC in 1994.  DBSC holds FCC DBS
permits to operate 11 channels at 61.5 degrees W and another 11 at
175 degrees W, Radin said.  DBSC has contract with Lockheed-Martin
to build 2 A2100 satellites, first scheduled for July 1997
delivery, other year later, he said.  Each carries 32 transponders
of 115 w each and contains technology that can double transmission
power to 230 w using 16 transponders.  Echostar has FCC permit to
operate 21 transponders at 119 degrees W.

     Echostar-1 will carry first 65-70 channels for service
scheduled to go on line in Feb.-March, spokeswoman said.  Service,
originally scheduled to be available in Sept., was delayed by
investigation that followed explosion of Long March rocket in Jan.
1995.  Echostar's Digital Sky Highway Network (DISH) is expected to
be in service by Feb. with 65 channels and another 65 added with
launch of Echostar-2 in July-Sept.  In competing with Digital
Satellite Service (DSS), Primestar and AlphaStar, Echostar has said
it plans to focus on satellite dealers, while alliance with Philips
brings Magnavox brand product to consumer electronics retailers. 
Although Echostar hasn't set pricing, it indicated in prospectus
that hardware would be priced around $500, with monthly programming
fee starting at $20.

     While Echostar hasn't reported plans for international market,
Radin said satellite at 61.5 degrees W potentially could supply
programming for Portugal, Spain and U.K. as well as Mexico, Latin
and South America.  Any plans for international service will
require FCC approval, which is reviewing Radin's request (and those
of other operators) to provide international service from domestic
slot.  Radin said that while Echostar hasn't made plans for
international DBS, officials there "are enthusiastic for an
international initiative."

     Meanwhile, Thomson Consumer Electronics, RCA Digital Satellite
System manufacturer, said it didn't renew distribution contract
with Echostar Communications since latter plans to launch own DBS
system to compete with DirecTV and USSB, which use DSS equipment. 
Thomson gave 4 of its remaining TVRO distributors expanded
territories:  Warren Companies, Sioux Falls, S.D., grows by 7
states and Northern Cal.;  Consumer Satellite Service (CSS),
Indianapolis, adds 3 states;  DSI, Urbandale, Ia., expands by 5
states;  Earth Terminal, Bow, N.H., adds 4 states.

DSS PRICING FOLLOWS CONSUMER ELECTRONICS TREND -- DOWN

     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to drop
and competition increases, entry-level product appears poised to
dip below $300.  Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) low-end RCA DSS
system that started 1995 at $699, was being advertised by year-end
at $499, and retailers said profit is in danger of drying up.  To
combat falling prices, some retailers are focusing on step-up RCA
and Sony DSS products that promise 20-25% profit margins, but
slower sales.  Overall, 1995 sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to
dealers were expected to top 1.5 million, while Primestar reported
close to million subscribers.

     "You've got some very big players coming into the business [in
1996] and many aren't going to be able to take the high road,"
Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you are 6
to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."  Lower retail prices are
expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshiba and Uniden enter DSS
race, with Uniden already indicating it may price product in
$499-$549 range.  Alphastar and Echostar also are planning to
introduce own services -- latter partnering with Philips to bring
Magnavox product to retail.  Even Primestar, which primarily has
leased equipment to consumers, has tested sales through group cable
operator TCI.

     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2
powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCA
and GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has been
advertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony model, which
originally had $749 suggested price tag, was featured in Wiz ad at
$648.

     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze suppliers, which
have said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones where
hardware is offered virtually free and profits are made on service. 
Echostar spokeswoman conceded as much.  Echostar hasn't formally
released pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardware
retails could hit $500, with programming at $20.

     Alphastar has said it will avoid selling own brand at retail,
relying instead on combination of Amway, satellite distributors and
multilevel marketing.  Company signed agreement with Samsung
Electromechanics in Aug. to build integrated receiver decoders
(IRDs) and said it's seeking similar agreement with 2nd supplier. 
Samsung and 2nd supplier are expected to sell branded product to CE
dealers.  "I would think that for this product the equipment would
pass the cost curve much more rapidly than the marketing cost of
attracting a subscriber," said Alphastar Pres.-CEO Murray
Klippenstein, whose company plans to launch 120-channel service in
1996 first quarter with hardware packages at $600-$700.  "When that
happens, it makes sense to give the box away because the long-term
value is in the subscription."

     With so many satellite systems to choose from, future hinges
on manufacturers' ability differentiate products.  Many retailers
have said they won't give category same amount of shelf space as
other products such as VCRs, meaning that suppliers will be
battling for every square inch.  "When you can't [tell
differences], you end up dealing with a price issue and end up with
$499 satellite systems," Tops Appliance City Senior Vp-Gen. Mdse.
Mgr. Rick Jones said.

ALPHASTAR SETS PLANS FOR NEW SATELLITE SERVICE

     AlphaStar will launch medium-power satellite service late in
first quarter priced at $600-$700 for hardware, with sales limited
to distributors and direct marketers, Pres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein
said.  Company will sell single integrated receiver decoder (IRD)
with 30" dish and remote control to dealers through distributor
O'Rourke Bros. and to consumers through Amway and multilevel
marketer United Digital Bcstg. Corp.  Programming will be sold in
packages at $24-$49 monthly, with some offering 40 video and 30
audio channels.  Premium pay packages and a la carte channels will
retail at $4.95-$14.95 per month, with 16 PPV channels at $2.99 per
movie.

     Full 120-channel service, to be available 2-3 weeks after
launch, will consist of 85 video, 30 audio and 3-5 data services. 
IRD contains RS232 port to connect with PC to download data
services and access Internet, Klippenstein said.  IRD also will use
MPEG-2 data transmission and have LED.

     To gain entry to consumer electronics retail, AlphaStar said
it's negotiating with several manufacturers to build product for
sale under own brand name.  First such accord was signed with
Samsung early in 1995 and it expects product to be available late
in 1996 first quarter, Klippenstein said.  "We're targeting
specific customer bases rather than going with a mass market
approach that requires huge inputs of advertising, media and
consumer electronics distribution," Klippenstein said.

     Although $600-$700 is above AlphaStar's original target of
$500, Klippenstein said retail would drop $100 per year.  He said
AlphaStar service will break even with sales of 500,000 units,
estimated to be 12-18 months after launch.  Service is in first
round of beta test consisting of 300-400 units in Canada and is
expected to enter U.S. with another 400 in Jan., Klippenstein said. 
Second beta test will use uplink center in Oxford, Conn., he said.

     AlphaStar is in "serious discussions" with several possible
investors, Klippenstein said.  Potential partners would buy equity,
although he would identify them only as in "broad genre of
telecommunications."  AlphaStar also recently cut stock offering to
2.1 million shares from 4 million, reducing amount expected to be
raised to $37 million from $51 million.

     AlphaStar first will provide service using AT&T Telstar 402R
with 32 Ku-band 60-w transponders, launched Sept. 23.  By mid-1977,
it will switch to Telstar 5 100-w satellite, where it will lease 16
Ku-band transponders.

CLINTON VETOES DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION INCLUDING SPACE SYSTEMS
FUNDING

     President Clinton last week vetoed FY 1996 Defense
Authorization bill that would have included hundreds of million of
dollars for new satellite systems and space technology.  He said he
vetoed bill because it included $450 million for new ballistic
missile defense system that would have included space-based element
for deployment by 2003.  Congressional Democrats had argued that
system would violate Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with former
Soviet Union, and Clinton said it was costly and unnecessary to
protect U.S. from long-range missiles in that way.  Republicans
said treaty is outdated product of Cold War and said several
countries in addition to Russia are developing nuclear weapons
capable of reaching U.S.  Democrats said they don't have serious
objections to other space aspects of bill and it's likely that
authorization for those programs would remain virtually unchanged
in any future legislation.

     Included in vetoed bill was major cutback in spending for U.S.
spy satellite program.  Although Congress had earmarked $28 billion
for intelligence activities this year, National Reconnaissance
Office (NRO), supersecret agency that oversees spy satellites,
wouldn't have gotten its usual share.  Congress, upset over
revelations last year that office was building secret new facility
in Va. for $302 million and that it had carried over $1.2 billion
in leftover money from previous year's budget, cut more than $1
billion from NRO's $9 billion authorization.  Most of that money
has been transferred to Pentagon's general budget.

     Cuts in reconnaissance budget didn't come as surprise and
probably would be supported by Democrats, who have backed reduced
spending for other civil space programs, including NASA's satellite
operations.  Lawmakers including Rep. Castle (R-Del.), House
Intelligence Committee member, had indicated during authorization
discussions earlier in year that tightening budgets would mean spy
satellite programs probably would have to go way of NASA -- toward
smaller, cheaper spacecraft and less expensive launch providers. 
Castle in Sept. said govt. also would have to start using more
commercially developed technologies where appropriate.  If
cost-saving measures aren't taken, he said, "we will be faced with
truly unpalatable choices," including devoting greater percentage
of intelligence budget to satellites or forgoing or eliminating
"much-needed" satellite capabilities to fund other programs.

     Also in authorization legislation was $30 million for new
antisatellite program that would have resulted in production of 10
missiles over next 4 years with capability of shooting down enemy
intelligence satellites in low-earth orbit.  Another $250 million
would have been authorized for deployment of Space & Missiles
Tracking System, with full satellite constellation deployment by
2003.  Although it would have played role in BMD project, this
system also would have been used to track U.S. and allied launchers
and spacecraft.

     In area of GPS, authorization bill would have required Defense
Secretary William Perry to turn off selective availability (SA)
signals by May 1 unless he submits to Congress plans for:  (1) New
way to deny enemies ability to use GPS for military purposes
without denying U.S. civil and military users access to signal. 
(2) Development of new receivers and other techniques for weapons
and weapons systems that would provide "substantially improved"
resistance to jamming and other forms of electronic interference. 
Effect of SA turn-off would have been minimal on commercial users
since most already use differential GPS, which is more accurate
than GPS with or without selective availability.  Ann Ciganer,
exec. dir.-policy, GPS Industry Council, said aim of Congress
actually was to "send a strong message" that Defense Dept. needs to
develop electronic countermeasures to prohibit hostile powers from
using GPS against U.S. interests.

     Meanwhile, more than dozen military and commercial satellites,
including some that recently have been repositioned over Bosnia,
now are providing communications, weather and navigation for U.S.
and other troops in region, Pentagon said.  Spokesman said most
important will be earth imaging applications, provided by Spot
Image and others, and GPS technology that will help pilots of
military cargo planes and warplanes as well as individual troops
equipped with positioning handsets.

IMPROVED THRUST-TO-WEIGHT RATIOS AMONG BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR
REUSABLE ROCKETS

     Need to improve thrust-to-weight (F/W) ratios of rocket
engines 30% or more (to 75) for reusable launch vehicles (RLVs)
"presents developers with a difficult challenge," National Research
Council (NRC) told NASA in report on agency's 3-phase program to
develop RLVs.  Launch costs for commercial satellites and other
payloads could be significantly reduced with RLVs.  Another big
challenge for RLV developers, NRC said, is producing vehicle from
materials that will allow 90% of rocket's mass at launch to be
fuel.  Moreover, it said, "achieving orbit with the required
payload is only part of the challenge that has been undertaken by
the NASA/industry RLV program.  The other, equally important,
challenge is to demonstrate a system that is capable of achieving
a lower cost per launch and be clearly competitive with other
launchers worldwide."  To do that, report said, newly developed
engines, primary vehicle structures, thermal protection systems and
cryogenic tanks must be demonstrated to be "reusable with minimal
inspections or replacements for at least 20 missions and have a
lifetime of at least 100 missions."

     Current reusable engines including Space Shuttle Main Engine
(SSME) and Russian RD-120 don't generate sufficient F/W ratios for
RLVs, NRC said, so participants in program will have to increase
performance of those engines or develop new ones.  "Developments to
achieve this [30%-plus] increase have been identified by
contractors;  however, the committee believes that achieving
greater than 75 F/W will be very difficult, even with a totally new
engine.  Upgrading an existing engine to meet this challenge,
although less costly than developing a new engine, will be even
more difficult," report said.

     As for primary vehicle structure, NRC panel said it's
"concerned about the low, 15 percent maximum weight-growth margin
being applied this early in the development phase of a new design
using materials of moderate maturity."  It said 20 to 25% weight
growth is typical in early stage of design development.  "The need
to control weight growth tightly this early in the program places
a premium on accurate calculation of structural performance and
weight and on early verification that the structure can be built at
or below predicted weight," study said.  Otherwise, it said,
approach to develop structures undertaken by industry proponents --
Lockheed Martin, McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, and Rockwell -- is
"sound."

     Requirement for thermal protection system (TPS) that's as
effective as space shuttle's but has capability of withstanding
impact of space debris, is waterproof and can be removed (shuttle's
is glued in place) also was addressed.  "There are questions about
the resistance of tiles (refractory or metallic) to particle impact
at liftoff and landing and especially while in orbit at space
station altitude, where some predictions are that penetration of a
tank may occur at least once in a 100-mission cycle."  Level of
rain that safely can penetrate TPS also needs to be determined, it
said:  "It is clear that both the shuttle-improved and metallic
TPSs have significant higher resistance [to water], but neither has
been totally quantified across the operational map."  Waterproofing
issues "must be resolved," it said, because "the time and manpower
required to apply waterproofing after each shuttle flight do not
meet the requirements for the turnaround times required for an
RLV."

     NRC said development program for cryogenic tanks is "robust"
because multiple approaches are being developed.  It said 2
aluminum-lithium alloys (Reynolds alloy 2195 and Russian alloy
1460) are being examined as well as 3 fabrication techniques
(machining to net-shape extrusion, net-shape spin forming, net-roll
forging) and 2 welding techniques (standard and friction-stir).  It
said Russian alloy is 25% above specifications but needs to be
tested because it's new.  Reynolds alloy "exhibits better cryogenic
ductility" and strength than previously used materials but is
difficult to produce consistently.  Friction-stir welding technique
"seems to be a promising solution to the problem of welding
aluminum-lithium alloys," report said, but needs to be tested more,
especially on thin sheets such as those to be used for liquid
oxygen tanks.

     NASA and industry have adopted "reasonable approaches to
advance the state of the art in both space materials and
propulsion" in first phase of program, NRC said.  Phase II, which
entails construction of subscale flight model, is set to begin at
end of 1996.  NRC said that before then, other important issues
need to be addressed, including:  (1) Various aspects of propulsion
system such as plumbing, leak sensors, valves, purge systems, etc. 
(2) Integrated health monitoring system for all components and new
technologies.  (3) Ground support equipment for propulsion system. 
(4) Launch and landing sites, which it said require "considerable
more attention because of technical constraints imposed by various
orbits."

     Matra Marconi Space will manufacture 3 of its Eurostar
platform satellites for WorldSpace under agreement with prime
contractor Alcatel Espace.  First satellite, AfriStar 1, is
licensed by FCC and will provide services to "new generation of
personal, portable receivers" for users in Africa and Middle East
after launch in mid-1998, Alcatel said.  At 6-month intervals,
AsiaStar 1, licensed by Australia, will be launched to provide
similar services to Asia;  CaribStar 1, licensed by Trinidad and
Tobago, will serve Latin America and Caribbean.  WorldSpace
spokesman said Alcatel, which as prime contractor will build
payloads and select rockets, hasn't selected launch provider. 
System will cost $650 million to build and deploy, spokesman said. 
Money is from private sources, and Morgan Stanley served as
financial adviser, he said.  Meanwhile, Matra awarded Alcatel
contract to manufacture payload for Nilesat, owned by Egyptian
Radio & TV Union.

     Russian-built 4-stage Molniya rocket last week launched Indian
remote sensing satellite IRS-1C from Baikonur.  Also on booster is
566-lb. research subsatellite called Skipper.  Russia's Glavkosmos
commercial space company reportedly charged $16 million for launch. 
Russian-built IRS-1C, valued at $14 million, will spend 6 months
studying India's natural resources using 3 on-board high-resolution
cameras.  Indian Space Research Organization said all instruments
were functioning as expected Dec. 29, and satellite is scheduled to
begin experiments within 3 weeks.  U.S.-based Eosat, which
processes and markets remote sensing data to govt. and commercial
industry, will have access to information from that bird and 10
other Indian satellites to be launched over next 10 years. 
Skipper, jointly built by Utah State U. and Moscow Aviation
Institute, cost $2.4 million.  Launch brought to 8 number of
foreign satellites launched by Russia in 1995.  Country plans 10
such launches this year.

     Group of 4 Chinese organizations and 2 Singapore companies

     Group of 4 Chinese organizations and 2 Singapore companies
announced plans to create regional mobile satellite system called
Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications (APMT).  Backers of
$640-million project include China Satellite Launch & Tracking
Control, China Aerospace Corp., China Unicom, China
Telecommunications Bcst. Satellite, Singapore Telecom, Singapore
Technologies Telemedia.  APMT has requested proposals for 2
satellites and ground facilities.  First launch is planned for 1998
on Long March.  System will compete against Aces project backed by
consortium of Indonesian, Thai and Philippine companies and
AfroAsia system backed by Indian concerns.  Aces has contract for
Lockheed Martin satellite, AfroAsia will deploy Hughes bird. 
Singapore Telecom withdrew from Aces project but still is part
owner, along with Hughes and others, of American Mobile Satellite. 
However, that doesn't necessarily mean Hughes has edge in
competition to get contract for APMT satellite, analyst Tim Logue
of Reid & Preist said.  "Hughes doesn't have a sweetheart deal," he
said.  Entry of 3rd regional MSS provider in Asia raises questions
about whether market will support that many systems.  Logue said: 
"It's remarkable that 3 geostationary satellite-based systems are
planned for launch by the end of the century for Asia.  There may
be market enough for all to prosper, but the question is -- what
market share does that leave for the Big LEOs?"  He said Big LEOs
have significant investment from region, which will host 6-way
fight for MSS business, "but it's a big continent."

swing in value.  Suit was filed by attorney William Lerach of
Milberg, Weiss law firm, San Diego, who Trimble Pres. Charles
Trimble said has claimed "constituency" of shareholders, but "in
fact... only needs to find one disgruntled shareholder in order to
claim broad representation..."  Trimble charged lawsuit, one of
more than dozen filed against high-tech companies since Dec. 1, was
result of "clever niche market" that will "drain the energy out of
the entrepreneurial process."

SATELLITE STOCKS INCREASE IN NUMBER, VALUE IN '95 

     The number of publicly traded satellite and space stocks
increased noticeably in 1995 and most saw an increase in value over
the year although typically not enough to keep pace with the overall
market last year.
     In the last 18 months, at least seven space-related companies
have joined the list of publicly traded firms providing the public and
big investment funds with much broader options in space investment
than ever before.
     Big publicly traded companies, and especially large aerospace and
defense firms, saw large increases in stock values in 1995, according
to the Standard & Poor's (S&P) Index Services Group. As of Dec. 31,
the S&P 500 Index of the largest companies showed an increase of 34
percent in stock value during the year. Another index, the S&P 400,
tracks stocks of companies with capitalization in the mid-range,
generally less than $1 billion. Those stocks rose 29 percent in 1995
(see chart on page 4). 
     For aerospace and defense firms in the 500 list, stock values
were up an average of 62 percent, while the same category in the 400
list was up 37 percent, according to an analyst at S&P. Breaking the
genre down further, defense electronics firms on the 500 list shot up
in value by 96 percent in 1995. Telecommunications, by comparison,
increased 32 percent in the 500 category, which includes only three
companies: AT&T, MCI and Sprint.
     Joe Shammas, an S&P analyst, says despite fluctuations in the
value of most space-related stocks in 1995, the satellite segment
appears to be booming and headed for growth. 
     Companies like Globalstar, Orion, PanAmSat, Echostar and Spacehab
went public in 1995, and have shown mixed results in the intervening
months. In addition, companies like American Mobile Satellite Co. and
Orbital Sciences Corp. that already were public provided more evidence
that investing in space ventures can be a sound strategy.
     Tom Watts, an associate director at New York investment bank
Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., says that while the performance of space
stocks may not match the averages of the largest public firms,
"overall, their potential for growth is greater than the overall
economy." Satellite investments need to be viewed differently since
they are closer to "public venture capital" than mainstream stocks, he
says. 
     "Our point of view is that prior to the launch of the satellite,
there is very little good news that can come out [about a company's
progress], and bad news tends to set the price back," Watts says. Once
a launch date approaches, the company can show that it is reducing
business risk and the stock price appreciates.
     AMSC is one example. Its price was at about $12.50-$13.50 a share
in early last January, with a satellite launch in March. By late
December, the stock was trading at nearly $30 a share, despite
technical problems with the satellite.

  ...Successful Launch Raises Stock Price

     Echostar and PanAmSat are in the same category. Echostar saw its
stock appreciate after the successful launch of another company's
satellite, the Asiasat 2, on the Chinese Long March that Echostar
planned to use. After Asiasat was successfully boosted into space in
late November, Echostar stock rose from about $14 a share to more than
$17. Then in late December, Echostar's own satellite was launched and
its price rose to more than $24.
     PanAmSat plans to launch its PAS 3R satellite on an Ariane rocket
next month, which will allow the company to enter the highly
competitive business of providing Direct to Home satellite television
service in Latin America in a few months. The Jan. 9 launch will be
the first for PanAmSat since it went public. The stock initially sold
for $17 a share and last week was trading for around $22. 
     By year's end, Globalstar stock had recovered nicely from a sharp
dip in its mid-year price. The stock was issued at $20 a share, then
plunged to about $12 but by late December was trading at more than
$30. Since Globalstar is still far from launch, no clear explanation
exists for why the price climbed back up.  Watts of Bear, Stearns says
investors decided not to rush to purchase Globalstar after it finished
the initial offering. The price then fell and investors changed their
minds as they worried that they'd miss out on buying shares at a low
price.

  ...Catching A Rising Star

     Another stock to watch is Tee-Comm, an electronics company based
in Canada that is behind the Alphastar direct-to-home satellite
television proposal and the Expressview DTH venture there. Tee-Comm's
stock traded at a little more than $3 a share earlier in 1995, and by
year's end was over $10. With service to begin in January, Watts
expects the value to grow more this year.
     High yield bond offerings by the satellite industry did not fare
as well in 1995 with three offerings pulled from the market because
the firms could not obtain the desired terms from investors. Orion
Network Systems, Iridium and Globalstar were forced to rethink their
financing strategies after withdrawing junk bond deals that would have
raised nearly $1 billion in total. 
     Besides the public market, SpaceVest, a private investment fund
that specializes in space projects, also saw growth in its resource
pool in 1995.  
     John Higgenbotham, SpaceVest president, says SpaceVest added
Barclay's Bank to its fund in a second round of financing that raised
the total fund from $41 million to $46 million. Higgenbotham says
SpaceVest invested in six companies in 1995 and will be involved in
another six to eight deals by about the third quarter of 1996 before
trying to raise money for another investment fund.
     While 1995 saw unprecedented levels of public investment in
satellite firms, the year ahead could be even busier.  
     Wolfgang Demisch, managing director of equity research at Bankers
Trust Securities, says 1996 will be another highly active year for
satellite financing, with operations starting for several ventures,
including direct broadcast service Echostar. The first launch for
mobile telephone venture, Iridium Inc., is another event the market
will be watching. The initial public offering for U.S. Satellite
Broadcasting, expected shortly, also will be important, he says.
     "The USSB IPO will set an independent equity valuation for a
purely space-based broadcasting business," Demisch says. The success
of the USSB stock sale will demonstrate how the market values Hughes's
investment in DirecTV and set the tone for other projects: "The market
will recognize there is a tremendous new opportunity, although it is
still in the new stages."

SPACEHAB GOES PUBLIC; REVEALS PROFIT STREAM FOR '93-95

     Spacehab, a commercial space firm that went public Dec. 21, has
been posting sizable profit and income figures for the last three
years, according to its Dec. 20 prospectus.
     Spacehab has been posting net income levels of $4-$16 million on
revenues of about $45 million a year, contradicting the belief among
some that non-satellite-related commercial space activities have a
hard time making money.
     Spacehab's public offering raised about $45 million on the sale
of 3.75 million shares of common stock at $12 per share. The company
received slightly more than $40 million after deducting the cost of
raising the money. The stock closed at 12 1/8 on Jan. 2.
     The company, founded in 1984, owns and operates pressurized
modules that fly in the back of space shuttles to provide additional
room for experiments, equipment and crew. NASA has been virtually its
only customer, and the company has been able to withstand difficulties
that have included frequent shifts in government commercial space
policy, the delays associated with the space shuttle accident in 1986
and special demands from investors to obtain insurance in case the
government reneged on its contracts. In addition, the market for users
of Spacehab services outside those sponsored by NASA has failed to
develop, in part because many potential customers can get free flights
from NASA. 
     Spacehab has survived by winning two NASA contracts, a $184.2
million fixed price contract awarded in 1990 to lease 200 lockers on
five space shuttle flights in a Spacehab module and a $54 million
contract awarded in mid-1995 to lease modules on four more shuttle
flights beginning in 1996. Of the sales, Spacehab had collected $174
million in payments from NASA by September 1995.
     Most of the company's revenues came in 1993-95, when Spacehab
took in $42 million, $44 million and $46 million, respectively. The
company posted gross profits of $19 million, $20 million and $23
million, respectively, in those years, with net income of $4 million,
$9 million and $16 million, respectively.

  ...Small Staff, Low Overhead

     To develop the Spacehab single module, the company spent $120
million, a company official says. The firm has remained tiny, with
only 14 employees, and contracts out much of its hardware and
processing jobs to larger companies. The small size has allowed
Spacehab's overhead to remain low.
     The $40.3 million in funds available from the public offering
will be applied in several ways, including $12 million to build a new
double version of the Spacehab module needed to fulfill the latest
NASA contract, when Spacehab will be used on shuttle flights to the
Russian Mir space station. The three Spacehab missions to date have
used a single module. Fifteen percent of the money is to be used to
pay creditors on a loan.
     Additional funds will be used to develop logistics equipment that
could be used to bid for work associated with Space Station Alpha,
expand the firm's payload processing facility and $1 million for the
acquisition of complementary businesses or facilities. Another $11
million is allocated to unspecified research and development and
working capital.
     The prospectus describes several potential business areas that
Spacehab may expand into, either through acquisitions or investment.
Spacehab has close ties with NASA's Centers for the Commercial
Development of Space (CCDS), since several of the centers have used
Spacehab lockers for NASA-sponsored experiments. The CCDSs are NASA-
sponsored consortia involving universities and companies that perform
commercial space research. The centers are working to develop new
drugs and materials that could become profitable space-related
products in the next few years and the prospectus lists eight
potential commercial products that could emerge from the research
flown so far.
     "The company intends to implement its Spacehab incubator program
in order to evaluate, sponsor and invest in a portfolio of
commercially focused, promising microgravity research and development
activities," the prospectus says. The incubator is a new Spacehab
program to invest in commercially funded research.
     Spacehab could subsidize the flight of experiments by other
companies or organizations in return for equity participation,
royalties or other rights in the new ventures, the prospectus says.
The CCDSs, however, generally are given free access to space shuttle
under previous arrangements with NASA. As products being developed by
the CCDSs mature toward the point when they will produce revenues,
NASA officials are trying to determine when to begin charging for
space flights. NASA's policy on charging commercial material
processing customers for space shuttle or space station access is
undecided.

  ...Space Station Opportunities Exist, But So Does Competition

     Spacehab officials also hope to win contracts in the space
station era, when the company's equipment could be used for logistics
support or to conduct experiments prior to flying them on space
station. NASA spends $300 million a year on space shuttle payload
processing, and Spacehab intends to pursue a portion of that market.
     But strong competition will come from several other firms with
more resources and experience, the prospectus notes. For space station
logistics support, Spacehab will be competing with foreign partners in
the program, in particular, Italy and Russia. Italy has agreed to
provide two pressurized modules to the program for logistics, while
Russia is offering the Progress logistics module. For payload
processing, McDonnell Douglas already is responsible for much of the
work, and the United Space Alliance, a venture involving Rockwell
International and Lockheed Martin, may be assigned payload processing
capabilities as part of the sole source contract NASA intends to award
it for space shuttle operations.

  ...Seeking Non-NASA Customers

     Spacehab also will attempt to find customers outside NASA to
lease locker space on its modules, although the company has had almost
no success in this regard in the previous six years. Intospace GmbH, a
European venture, has the right to sell Spacehab services in Europe
and China through 1999, while Mitsubishi has rights to sell them in
Japan until 2004.
     The total equity in Spacehab consists of 10.8 million shares, of
which 3.7 million were put on the public market and 7 million are
restricted, subject to limits before they can be publicly traded. The
percentage of the company sold through the initial public offering was
34.7 percent, a company official says.  
     After redistribution of equity from the public offering, Spacehab
is 20 percent owned by its officers and directors. Of that, Spacehab
Board Chairman Shelley Harrison owns 8.5 percent; Director Shi Huang
owns 8 percent. Harrison is an inventor of bar code scanners and holds
four patents on the technology;  Huang is based in Taiwan and heads
the investment group there. Subcontractors McDonnell Douglas (2.7
percent), Alenia Spazio (3.1 percent) and Mitsubishi Corp. (7.3
percent) also are major stockholders. Poly Ventures, L.P., a firm that
Harrison is a managing general partner of, owns 7.8 percent; Spacehab
Taiwan, Inc. has 7.3 percent; and Walter P. Kistler has 4 percent.

     U.S. SMALL SAT BUILDERS OFFER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AS INDUSTRY
ENTERS 2nd DECADE

     Dozens of small satellite models to fit a wide range of needs and
budgets have emerged from
     the small spacecraft renaissance that began about 10 years ago. 
     While buyers have more to choose from than ever before among
small satellite products, manufacturers face a competitive marketplace
that is producing orders more slowly than predicted. In 1996, small
satellite builders must cope with an environment where supply exceeds
demand and industry growth is restrained by the lack of cheap,
reliable launchers. 
     Does the industry have more capacity than demand? Builders
disagree.
     W. David Thompson, president of Spectrum Astro, says no. "We will
see the continuation and acceleration of the trend toward smaller
satellites. It's the only solution with the economic situation most
customers have, both government and commercial.  NASA has done a
tremendous turnaround in its programs... Agencies like NASA used to
spend $1 billion on a program, but now they're trying to take that $1
billion and break it into 20 segments of $50 million each" with many
small science projects as a result, he says. "There are more
opportunities for small satellite suppliers, not less."
     Ed Nicastri, Orbital Sciences Corp. small satellite division vice
president, says that when he looks at the demand vs. supply, he asks,
"Why is everybody fighting to get into the business?" Both executives
praised NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin's support of small
satellites. Nicastri expects a steady stream of new NASA contracts for
small satellites based on programs that have started in the last two
years such as New Millenium, the Student Explorers and the Small
Explorers. Defense Department small satellite use continues to be
limited to experimental missions, but Nicastri, who used to oversee
small satellite projects at the military's Advanced Research Projects
Agency, believes that military users are waking up to the application
of small satellites for operational missions like weather imaging.
     For example, Torrey Science & Technology Corp. was selected in
late December to receive Technology Reinvestment Program funding from
the Pentagon to demonstrate a prototype small satellite for secure,
mobile voice and data communications between handheld terminals. OSC
has been selected as the satellite supplier, although no contract had
been awarded yet. 
     Meanwhile, the builders are working to differentiate themselves.
     "Everybody has their niche. I am frustrated that we have not been
able to start more programs" that would generate more small satellite
orders across the industry, Rick Fleeter, president of AeroAstro, a
small satellite builder based in Virginia, says.  
     For example, the NASA-sponsored Student Explorer Demonstration
Initiative (STEDI) program run by the University Space Research
Associates was originally to pay for two to four cheap missions each
year. But the program has been under way for two years and only two
satellites have been started, so the annual rate is much less than
hoped for, Fleeter says. STEDI is done on a shoestring budget, with
$4.3 million allocated for an entire satellite and one year of
operations.  The bus may cost only $1.2 million, which rules many
expensive small satellite designs.
     One reason STEDI has been slow to start is that the U.S.
government has refused so far to let the Student Explorers use low
cost converted U.S. missiles as launchers, putting the satellites on
Pegasus rockets instead. The higher cost of the launchers has eaten
into the program funding, sources say. However, program managers hope
to get a small amount of NASA funding, some $3 million, in 1996 to
fund the start of a third mission and get competition going for
another round of inexpensive student satellites.
     Other expected orders, like some of the commercial communications
satellites for global mobile services, have not materialized when
expected, Fleeter adds.

  ...Intense Competition in '96

     George Sebestyen, CTA Space Systems president, expects "wide-
ranging, cut throat competition" for new orders in 1996. He expects
the Air Force to start about three efforts in the small experimental
class of satellite known as Space Test Experiments Platform, another
one or two classified projects, one or two new NASA orders, plus
possibly commercial orders once the Federal Communications Commission
completes some communications satellite licensing procedures.
     The poor track record of the small launch industry is damaging
the small satellite business indirectly, Sebestyen says. "Everybody is
scared witless about any launch vehicle, no matter who makes it," he
says. "We need low cost launch vehicles. There's no point in building
small satellites without a low cost launch vehicle."
     Sales have not dropped noticeably as a result of the failures
yet, but delays in launch schedules have left satellites stacked up
waiting for launch, that in turn delay the start of other new
programs. "The biggest impact is that nothing goes up. It's very
discouraging," he says.

  ...Can Big Companies Make Small Satellites?

     Although small satellites have been around since the start of the
space age, the business began to evolve into its current shape in the
mid-1980s when a few entrepreneurs began to challenge the notion that
satellites had to be big and cost a small fortune. The David vs.
Goliath mentality is still around, and with the overall shrinkage of
the space business, the small satellite programs are attracting more
and more large companies, says Jill Stern, a Washington attorney who
has been involved in the small satellite business.
     "My question is whether the [big companies] can preserve the
efficiencies that attracted people to small satellites in the first
place," Stern asks.
     Thompson says the emphasis on small satellites is straining the
ability of all the companies to staff the programs, creating a new
problem industry wide.  "Even the biggest companies historically have
had only two to three satellite design teams, which used to be
surrounded with 500 people each. Now the small satellite projects
support only 30 or so people on each team, and the companies need six
or seven design teams. Even the largest companies don't have that kind
of expertise around," he says. "You can't stand to have any loafers
[on a small satellite project]. You can't stand to have anyone on the
team who doesn't contribute to the program. Everyone is scrambling [as
companies recruit] to get the top 20 percent of the people on their
company team."
     But Thompson says the intense pressure to get rid of
nonproductive workers who inflate program costs is the reason the U.S.
space industry is turning itself around in a matter of years, unlike
foreign competitors whose industrial practices "move as slow as
molasses."
     The biggest problem for small satellite builders is their
attitude toward the market, Stern says. "Most of them are waiting for
someone to give them a contract. They will have to become service
providers or form alliances with companies that do marketing or
provide voice and data services" if the suppliers want to see their
business grow, she says.  
     Several of the builders, notably TRW and Orbital Sciences Corp.,
already have done so and received manufacturing contracts as a result.
      "Often in this business, the best opportunity is in going out
and creating the need for your product...The guys who will succeed,
who will stay alive, are not waiting for someone to anoint them,"
Nicastri says.
     At least six U.S. companies have been successful in developing
small satellite businesses in the last few years, and competition is
coming from Russia and Europe. By the end of January, a team of French
satellite manufacturers will be awarded a contract to build six small
satellites with options for more for Starsys Global Positioning Inc.,
industry sources say.  Alcatel Espace would serve as prime contractor
for the payload and integration, and Matra Marconi as subcontractor
for the satellite bus. Starsys, owned 80 percent by GE Americom and 20
percent by French investors, holds a U.S. license to deploy a low
Earth orbit constellation of data messaging satellites.

IN BRIEF

     *  Where's the next Pegasus launch?  Small satellites are stacked
up waiting the restart of Pegasus operations, which have been frozen
since the failure of a Pegasus XL launch June 22. OSC  spokeswoman
Elena Fuhrman says there is no launch date for the next mission, but
she expects it in February or March, after more tests on the rocket
are completed.

     *  An Indian remote sensing satellite, IRS-1C, was launched from
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhastan atop a Russian Molniya rocket Dec.
28. The 1,250-kg satellite's imagery will be distributed outside India
by Eosat of the U.S.

     *  After a successful cryogenic engine test last month,
Arianespace has set May 7 as the target date for the inaugural launch
of the Ariane V rocket.

     *  Global mobile communications satellite systems and services,
including GEO and non-GEO, are expected to represent a $20 billion
market by the turn of the century, of which $11 billion would be
satellites, launches, and ground equipment, the U.S. Office of
Commercial Space Transportation says.

FEDERAL AID COULD LAUNCH PRIVATE BOOSTER INDUSTRY, STUDY SAYS

    Aggressive federal incentives to develop commercial programs,
coupled with launch of U.S. govt. payloads, may prove key to
financial success of American private launch companies, new report
said:  "The private launch industry is on the verge of becoming a
viable business operation.  However, its future lifeblood is heavily
dependent on launching of government payloads."

    Titled, "An Economic Perspective on the Future Commercialization
of Space," report was written by Henry Hertzfeld and Frank Baradino
of Gellman Research Assoc., Pittsburgh, for National Chamber of
Commerce Foundation.  Hertzfeld told us study was "an examination of
the economic framework for realizing space ventures" (see separate
story this issue).

    Fearing market shakeout, officials of 3 major launch companies
-- General Dynamics (GD), Martin Marietta (MM) and McDonnell Douglas
(MD),  -- already are reviewing study.  Art Conroy, MD commercial
space market analyst, said, "There are lots of doubts whether demand
will equal capacity" over next 5 years because number of competing
U.S. and foreign launch companies could make market "supply heavy."
Federal initiatives "would be welcomed," he said.

    Report said govt. has legitimate role in promoting or sponsoring
space activities because supplying "national transportation
infrastructure was always a government function."  For example, U.S.
paid high up-front costs for interstate highway system and thereby
encouraged creation of new jobs and methods of transporting goods
and new services.  It also "induced" commercialization of aviation
in 1920s-1930s through mail subsidies and "can do the same thing for
space" since boosters are "major highways and feeder systems -- the
infrastructure -- that must be in place if commercialization of
space" is to occur, study said.

    Foreign competition also provides justification for federal
assistance since U.S. private launch companies suffer from
disadvantage of competing against boosters owned by foreign govts.,
not by private foreign companies, report said, so U.S. could attempt
to channel benefits from its R&D to private sector.  In past,
foreign companies have benefited from such R&D by copying and
improving on U.S.-financed designs, building 2nd-generation hardware
at cheaper costs, study said, citing Ariane launch systems, Spot
satellites for remote sensing, Japanese communications equipment.

    Precise picture of profitable future investment prospects isn't
clear and companies are working to focus it, several industry
spokesmen said.  Conroy said:  "MD is working very hard to see how
it should position itself" to obtain sound market share.  GD
spokesman said:  "Potential markets must be identified before
changes in our marketing strategy can be made."  Conroy said he felt
lack of budget for Advanced Launch System (ALS) (SCB Dec 29 p6)
would intensify competition for federal payloads, creating situation
similar to Japan's, where number of companies in single industry
must battle for small number of contracts.  U.S. Dept. of
Transportation estimates worldwide civilian demand is only 15-25
satellites and suborbital payload launches through 1995.

    Report said reevaluation of govt. controls will prove necessary
as some activities transfer from public to private sector.  In past,
U.S.:  (1) Owned all launch vehicles and all satellites.  (2) Had to
manifest and process all satellites before launch.  (3) Set prices
for launching private payloads until recently.  Companies now are
free to declare their own launch prices and, thanks to efforts to
streamline liftoff management, number of special licenses and safety
inspections formerly required by govt. probably will be cut back.

    Proposals to build private launch facilities, if carried out,
could lower costs.  Hawaii, Fla. and Australia have been named as
possible sites.  Operation of private launch pads would eliminate
need for govt. to set fees for use of facilities on its property,
report said.  However, some high costs will remain because of
up-front investments required for space hardware that "cannot be
recouped if the project fails" and because of insurance
expenditures, study said.

PENTAGON SEEKS TO USE SPACE FACILITIES IN DRUG WAR ROLE

    Administration is studying Defense Dept. proposals that, if
approved, would allow use of photoreconnaissance and signals
intelligence (SIGINT) satellites to track international drug
traffickers, Pentagon officials said.  Defense Secy. Richard Cheney
and Gen. Colin Powell, head of Joint Chiefs of Staff, have endorsed
several drug surveillance schemes submitted to National Security
Council (NSC).  President Bush is expected to approve plans at NSC
meetings later this month, Air Force officials said.

    Last year DoD spurned urgings by members of Congress to assume
role in fighting drug wars.  However, faced with tightening budgets
and fading East-West tensions, Pentagon decided combating illicit
drugs offers possible way to fight fiscal cutbacks and retain
political clout, Air Force officials said.

    Details of proposals remain classified.  However, congressional
staffer cited 2 plans that would:  (1) Use high-resolution
photoreconnaissance satellites such as KH-11s to monitor shifting
location of drug bases or pinpoint drug processing labs in Latin
America and Caribbean.  (2) Relay satellite-gathered data to U.S.
Navy ships that would interdict drug shipments from Southeast Asia.

    Change in Pentagon's policy reportedly stems from Cheney and
Powell, who knew Administration was going to give high priority to
war on drugs.  Previous Defense Secys. Caspar Weinberger and Frank
Carlucci strongly opposed congressional suggestions of military
role.  Congress's interest in using military facilities became clear
in late Dec. 1988 when passage of Defense Authorization Act gave N.
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) antidrug role.  NORAD's
chief mission is to warn Pentagon of potential Soviet bomber or
missile attacks on N. America, yet its head, Air Force Gen. John
Piotrowski, recently said that fighting drugs has become its
"2nd-highest priority."

    NORAD is using ground radar, AWACs radar planes and fighters to
intercept drug trafficking in Caribbean but wants supplemental
network of satellites because of large area to be monitored.  Air
Force in Dec. 1988 asked for Space-Based Wide Area surveillance
system but budget cuts slowed program.  "It's still sitting there,
vegetating," Air Force spokesman said.  Version of space-based
system reportedly is among proposals submitted to NSC, another Air
Force spokesman said.

    Could existing DoD space assets handle new mission?  Some
expressed doubt.  Paul Stares, military space analyst at
Washington-based Brookings Institution, said:  "There aren't that
many satellites up there -- 3 KH-11s, an upgraded KH-11, 2 Magnums
[SIGINT birds] -- and most assignments for them were made way in
advance.  But you'd think that Pentagon officials would sit down
with Defense Intelligence Agency [DIA] experts and see if new
designated targets really could be monitored before submitting
proposals."

    Another expert said he thought Pentagon might be overburdened by
antidrug role.  Jeffrey Richelson, space intelligence expert at
Washington-based National Security Archive, said:  "How much can you
do before you overstretch your resources?  I think existing
[satellite] assets are already heavily tasked by various agencies
such as DIA and the CIA."

    New DoD program also could prove hard on birds, both said.
Recent proposals may mean military geosynchronous spy satellites
would have to be repositioned to cover targets, shortening their
lifespan, Stares said.  He said this probably could be avoided in
case of SIGINT or radar-imaging birds such as Lacrosse.  But
Richelson said SIGINT birds, not geosynchronous units, might require
repositioning:  "The KH-11s would probably stay where they are, but
not the SIGINTs, because in the past SIGINT birds in the Western
Hemisphere directed their coverage at the European-Asian landmass.
I would think some of the older versions such as Chalets or Vortexes
would have to be moved" and more might be needed.

    Heavy data flow could prevent launching of additional birds
because of Pentagon's concern that more information might be
generated than DoD would be able to analyze.  Richelson said:  "It
becomes a question of data management.  Even if you could launch an
additional satellite -- say it was a photoreconnaissance -- you
couldn't support it without turning half the country into
photointerpreters."

DEFENSE SPENDING CUTS LEAD TO PROPOSED SALE OF FORD AEROSPACE

    Ford Motor Co. said it's trying to sell Ford Aerospace Corp.
Confirming "ballpark" figure, official said unidentified potential
buyer had made $1.8 billion preliminary offer.  Disclosure followed
weeks of rumors and, as late as Jan. 5, denials from Ford Aerospace
spokesman that company was on block.  Questions remain whether sale
would include all Ford Aerospace holdings, including BDM
International, McLean, Va.;  Space Missions, Seabrook, Md.;
Washington Operations, company's east coast hq.  Company, with
Hughes and GM, is one of "Big 3" U.S. communications satellite
manufacturers.  Ford Aerospace spokeswoman said that company policy
prohibits comment on "speculative stories about acquisitions" but
that it would release public announcement "to clarify the rumors
soon."

    Proposed sale reportedly was undertaken for 2 reasons:  (1)
Uncertainties over govt. defense spending in wake of warming
East-West relations.  (2) Need to focus on automaking in face of
declining sales and intensifying global competition.  Prospectus
describing Aerospace unit reportedly had been distributed to
potential buyers, with Alcatel/Aerospatiale (AA), Boeing, Lockheed,
Martin Marietta, McDonnell Douglas and TRW among those that may be
interested.  Boeing, MD, MM and TRW declined comment, and Lockheed
said it hadn't heard of possible sale.  AA officials weren't
available.

    Ford is holding regularly scheduled board meeting Jan. 11
(Thurs., after our deadline) and former Ford Aerospace official said
prospectus for proposed sale "has been prepared" and would be on
agenda.  Company books then would be inspected by prospective
buyer's visiting team, ex-official said.  Goldman Sachs is acting as
Ford Motor financial adviser, he said.  Ford wouldn't be first
automaker to react to concern that thaw in East-West relations
spells reductions in federal spending on weaponry:  Chrysler Corp.
announced last month it was pulling out of defense business.
General Motors has denied any interest in selling its Hughes
Aircraft Co. subsidiary, which started laying off 6,000 of its
75,000 employes in 2nd half of 1989.

    Ford Aerospace received $1.7 billion in contracts, both civilian
and military, in fiscal 1989.  Company is "in good shape," source
close to Ford said.  It has 17,000 employees, and spokesman said 70%
of its business is with military.  Ford Aerospace produces Chaparral
and Sidewinder missiles and is heavily involved in satellite
manufacture.  It also runs military's jet pilot training ranges and
NASA's mission control center in Houston and is building parts of
U.S. space station to be orbited in late 1990s.

    Ford Motor Co.'s auto sales dropped 22% in late Dec. from same
period last year, but it reportedly was only domestic automaker to
increase its market share in 1989.  Ford, which has about $2 billion
cash on hand, acquired U.K.'s Jaguar auto company in Nov. for $2.5
billion and in Aug. purchased nation's 3rd largest independent
finance company, Associates First Capital Corp., for $3.4 billion.

    In other business, Ford Aerospace said it had completed
fabrication of 2nd Superbird satellite for Space Communications
Corp. (SCC), Japan, and had shipped it to launch site in Kourou,
French Guyana.  "This program has demonstrated its commitment to its
customers," Commercial Space Programs Operations Dir. Christopher
Hoeber said.  Built at Ford Aerospace's Space Systems Div. in Palo
Alto, Superbird B is scheduled for launch Feb. 20 aboard Ariane
booster;  it left San Jose Airport on chartered plane Jan. 6.

TRW AND MOTOROLA DEVELOP SUPER MICROPROCESSOR FOR SPACE SYSTEMS

    World's most advanced chip for communications satellites or
other spacecraft has been developed by Motorola and TRW as part of
Defense Dept.'s $1 billion Very High Speed Integrated Circuit
(VHSIC) program, TRW said.

    New device is 2.1-in. silicon square containing more than 4
million transistors that act as "brain" or central processor in
advanced digital signal processing systems such as those that
control communications satellites.  Chip, designated CPUAX (Central
Processing Unit - Arithmetic Extended) SuperChip, is able to perform
at world's fastest operating speed -- 200 million actions per sec.
TRW VHSIC Programs Dir. Thomas Zimmerman said:  "Two hundred million
operations per second mean the CPUAX... is the computational
equivalent of some supercomputers that fill an entire room, require
elaborate refrigeration systems and weigh several tons."  SuperChip
is able to repair itself during operation when used in conjunction
with TRW-Motorola Universal Processor chip consisting of 36,000
devices that test, monitor and configure "on-chip assets of CPUAX,"
company said.

    Potential uses are numerous, ranging from spacecraft to jet
fighters and missiles, Zimmerman said.  Tiny size and great power
mean it potentially could replace hundreds of thousands of
microprocessors currently used aboard spacecraft.  He said possible
commercial applications include any program where high speed, small
size and great computing power are required, including medical
diagnosis, complex imaging, factory operations, computer-aided
design.

    However, immediate commercial potential is limited, DoD
spokesman said. Only handful of new chips has been produced and they
must compete with cheaper, more readily available microprocessors.
Time also will be required to integrate new devices into existing
products and manufacturing processes, he said.  Team of DoD analysts
already is studying best potential market applications.

    Superchip is likely eventually to improve U.S. competitive
position in semiconductor field by reducing time, size and cost of
higher performance computing, said Richard Freeman, space analyst
and former Hughes vp.

    Space Shuttle Columbia was launched Jan. 9 on 10-day mission to
retrieve Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) and launch Navy
communications satellite that was deployed next day.  Hughes bird,
costing $85 million, will complete network of 5 satellites Pentagon
uses to communicate with its military facilities worldwide.
Satellite was ejected by spring, activated by explosive devices that
spun it into space in what NASA officials call "frisbee"
deployment.  Columbia's next task is to retrieve LDEF and 57
Marshall Space Center experiments that are expected to provide key
insights into effects of space on materials (SCB Dec 29 p2).  LDEF
was predicted to enter earth's atmosphere in Feb. and burn up if not
rescued.  LDEF had been scheduled to be retrieved 10 months after
being placed in orbit in 1984 but scheduling problems and 1986
Challenger disaster caused 5-year delay.  Orbiter must be careful in
rescuing satellite since craft could be in fragile condition, NASA
said.  Shuttle was to retrieve LDEF using remote manipulator system
(RMS).  It first was to pass below spacecraft and circle up and over
it.  Called R-Bar approach, this doesn't require close-in
flyaround.  Maneuver was to face Columbia's payload bay toward earth
with LDEF between and perpendicular to earth and orbiter.  When
orbiter is 400 ft. from LDEF with RMS arm extended, yaw maneuver
will place satellite directly above crew compartment, allowing Cmdr.
Dan Brandenstein and Pilot James Wetherbee to fly at same speed and
direction as LDEF.  Mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar was to direct
RMS toward grapple completion while LDEF was 35 ft. above orbiter.
LDEF will remain in Columbia's payload bay during routine postflight
servicing at Edwards Air Force Base, Cal.  Columbia's 10-day flight
is 2nd-longest in 33 shuttle missions.

    Olin Corp. announced it plans to double capacity for production
of Ultra Pure hydrazine in Lake Charles, La.  Pres. Robert Yohe said
Air Force recently awarded Olin one-year contract to produce 42,000
lbs. for use in satellite propellant systems.  Expansion, which it
said will boost production capacity to 100,000 lbs. per year, is
expected to be on line by May.  Yohe said there was "excellent
potential" for special grade mixture to be used for military, NASA
and commercial satellites' attitude control and orbit correction
systems.  Olin said patented process produces aniline-free product
that doesn't leave carbon deposits on engine nozzles, extending
useful operating life of satellites and enhancing engine performance.

    Outdated production modes of U.S. private launch industry are
acting to boost launch costs, think-tank space expert and industry
official said.  Angelo Codevilla, senior research fellow at Hoover
Institute, Palo Alto, and former Senate Intelligence Committee
staffer, said boosters aren't built efficiently because "there
aren't any assembly lines."  Instead, components are processed in
widely separated parts of "enormous" company compounds so process
works "with all the efficiency of a cottage industry," he said.  Art
Conroy, McDonnell Douglas commercial space analyst, agreed:  "We
have a cottage industry approach, and the only thing that will ever
change it is a traumatic recession."  "Nowhere in the space world,"
Codevilla said, "does industry work on advanced manufacturing
patterns, with the exception of the assembly line Hughes uses to
build its communications satellites."  Outdated production methods
are caused chiefly by reluctance of govt. to "make predictable
long-term investment" for large volume purchase of launchers that
would justify expense to companies of establishing assembly lines
similar to those used by Soviet Union to produce Proton and other
boosters, he said.

    Financially troubled American Rocket asked vendors for 60-day
extension of credit.  It said it needs time to negotiate additional
sales of its rocket motors, following disastrous Oct. 5 fire that
damaged nation's first privately developed rocket (SET-1) as it was
about to be launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Cal.  SET-1 was
to have been suborbital flight, carrying 2 payloads and designed to
test SDI missile detectors on orbiting satellites (SCB Oct 6 p1).
Air Force said damage to pad was minimal and Amroc announced it
would continue with modified version of 16-ton booster,  However, it
soon began reducing its work force.   Company warned that if it were
liquidated, creditors could expect "in the area of 5 cents on the
dollar."

    U.S. satellites and boosters will dominate worldwide commercial

    U.S. satellites and boosters will dominate worldwide commercial
space markets until 1994, when heavy supply and fading demand could
make attracting buyers difficult, European Space survey found.
"World Space Industry Survey:  10-Year Outlook," released last month
by Paris-based Euroconsult, said world market for telecommunications
satellites reached $6 billion for sixty-nine 2nd-generation
satellites, up from $2 billion for 37 first-generation birds.
Average unit price increased to $70 million from $63 million.
Launches of commercial geostationary payloads remained largest
market segment, with 90% consisting of communications satellites and
rest meteorological birds, survey said:  "A new period of high
activity is in progress and should last until 1994."  In 1989-2000
period, market value of launches of 173 satellites should reach
$9.2-$11.7 billion, with number of liftoffs estimated to stay at 20
annually until 1995, after which total should decline to 10 per year
by 2000.  By then new generation of birds should be operational,
survey said.  Report predicted that total market value of
communications satellites would peak at $13.7 billion by 2000, with
launch of 153-195 birds at average of $70 million each.  U.S. owed
dominance to military payloads, survey said:  "The military market
in the U.S., which is nearly 10 times larger than the civilian
market, is essential to the U.S. communications industry by virtue
of its size."  Break-even point for remote sensing and
meteorological birds won't be reached until 2nd half of 1990s with
survey predicting 2 satellites annually for civilian meteorology
birds and 2-3 per year for remote sensing.  Stiffer competition
among remote sensing systems should be feature of 1990s with
introduction of Soviet satellites.  But report said only Landsat and
Spot are "systems of worldwide... commercial scope."  Microgravity
market faces years of gradual growth before reaching profitability,
study said, projecting that big 3 U.S. launch companies -- General
Dynamics, Martin Marietta and McDonnell Douglas -- would dominate
booster market along with Europe's Arianespace.  Report said U.S.
companies would benefit from backlog of orders caused by failure of
expendable launch vehicles following 1986 Challenger disaster.

SPACE INDUSTRIES INTERNATIONAL FORMS
TELECOMMUNICATIONS/ELECTRONICS DIVISION
Houston TX

The Houston-based Space Industries International, Inc. (SIII)
announced last month that it is establishing a new division
called Space Industries Telecommunications and Electronics
Company (SITEC), also to be based in Houston.
SITEC will design and develop telecommunications systems and
interactive applications in a variety of transmission media, as
well as support the spaceflight electronics development efforts
of Space Industries. The new division will be headed by Dr.
Bartus H. Batson, an expert in communications electronics, who
was instrumental to the development of the space shuttle
communications system. Batson, an authority on satellite
communications and voice/data/ video applications, will be joined
by several other associates with whom he has worked previously.
A statement from SIII explains that SITEC will initially focus on
the design and engineering of international educational networks

NASA RELEASES STUDY ON LUNAR ENERGY ENTERPRISE.

The Space Studies Institute (SSI) of Princeton, NJ, has announced
that NASA has recently released a study on solar power satellites
titled "Report of the NASA Lunar Energy Enterprise Case Study
Task Force." While the initial purpose of the report was to study
mining solar-wind implanted helium-3 from lunar regolith, the
task force also decided to examine the use of lunar materials to
build solar power satellites, as proposed by Drs. Gerard O'Neill
and Peter Glasner of SSI. In addition, the report looks at the
idea of converting surface areas of the Moon into low grade solar
cells and transmitting the energy from the Moon to the Earth. The
report concluded that "the Moon must play a role in long-term
terrestial electricity supply matters," and calls for
comprehensive studies by industry, NASA, and the Department of
Energy so that a national commitment for space power can be
established.

SOLAR-POWERED HYDROGEN PRODUCTION LOOKING UP.

According to the Christian Science Monitor, the next ten years
will see the cheapness and efficiency of photovoltaic cells
doubled, enabling economic production of hydrogen as a clean,
alternative fuel source.  Drs. Joan Ogden and Robert Williams of
Princeton University predicted that development of solar cells
costing 20 to 40 cents a watt (versus the current $4.00/watt),
will make hydrogen fuel available for "the equivalent cost of
$1.50 to $2.00 a gallon of gasoline."  Current laboratory
research has already resulted in solar cell efficiencies of up to
14%.  U.S. government funding of hydrogen fuel research for 1989
was placed at $3 million a year, versus $50 million spent by West
Germany.  House Bill 2793, a five-year, $155 million program to
increase U.S. hydrogen fuel research, is aimed at reducing that
gap.

NASA UNLIKELY TO SUBMIT REVISED LUNAR/MARS PLANS

     NASA will most likely not submit a formal alternative
lunar/Mars mission architecture plan to the Administration's
recently established "Synthesis Group," according to Jeffery
Rosendahl, NASA's Assistant Director For Space Exploration
(International).
     The Synthesis group was established by the Administration to
evaluate alternative lunar/Mars approaches, technologies and
ideas gathered through a public outreach program kicked-off last
spring.  According to organizers, the ultimate goal of the group
is to produce 2 or more relatively distinct final mission
architectures which would then be studied for 3-5 years.
     While NASA has taken a further look at the various issues
surrounding accomplishment of the lunar/Mars missions since
submitting its "90-day Report" on the subject last fall,
Rosendahl told SPACE EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY last week that NASA
officials are currently leaning against submitting any kind of
revised lunar/Mars mission architecture plans.

A Cautious Approach To Lunar/Mars Recommendations

     Last fall, the agency received sizable criticism for the
conservative approach it used when outlining how the United
States could accomplish the President's goals of manned missions
to the moon and Mars.  But although NASA Administrator Richard
Truly had yet to make a final decision on the issue last week,
according to Rosendahl it will not likely use this latest
opportunity to answer that criticism.
     "If the Synthesis Group does its job right, they will
produce the architectures" following their review this year,
Rosendahl said.  "Our indications from the (Synthesis
Group)...are that they don't want NASA to bring in an
architecture or anybody else, necessarily.  They believe that's
their job," he said.
     But, he admits that there are other reasons why the nation's
space agency is taking such a cautious approach to further
lunar/Mars-related recommendations--the bulk of which appear to
be undeniably rooted in experience.
     Rosendahl explained that there are 2 primary "traps" NASA
officials hope to avoid and 2 potential newspaper headlines
they'd rather not read.
     The first "trap" could be a situation where NASA makes
recommendations that are too specific and is subsequently seen as
backing a plan that may be in competition with the lunar/Mars
plans of others.  "We do not want to get into a situation where
we're seen as getting into a contest" with other potential
exploration organizers or see newspaper headlines that read "NASA
BACKS PLAN X."
     On the other hand, perhaps an even worst perception would be
that after months of further study and in the midst of many
innovative lunar/Mars suggestions coming forward, the agency
couldn't produce any further creative ideas on the subject.
"NASA FAILS TO COME UP WITH ANY IDEAS," Rosendahl jokes.
     He admits, though, that the agency is much "smarter" on the
missions than it was last year and has conducted further
lunar/Mars studies at both NASA headquarters and field centers
     "We've looked at a broader range of options," he said.
"Different schedules, different content, different levels of
ambition, different levels of technology."

Small Number of Factors Will Drive Program Content

     "In a certain sense, it's beginning to look like there are
really a small number of things that wind up driving program
content, what a total program might look like.  They seemed to be
sort of the scope and scale of what you'd like to do when you get
there, the kind of presence you'd like to have, the kind of
operations you'd like to do, the number of people you want to
have to carry them out, the level of technology that you
employ...Are you going to use simple extrapolations of current
technology or are you going to try and make major developments in
new technology?"  Other variables include cost and schedule,
Rosendahl added.
     Lockheed's Director for Space Station Operations, Gus
Gustafero, agrees that those types of top-level decisions are
critical to how a lunar/Mars mission architecture is actually
shaped.  "Those are the things that have to be defined.
Sometimes architecture is defined in terms of what you want to do
when you get there and some people define it as `Here's how you
get there and don't worry about what you do when you get there.'
But I think you've got to work the problem backwards.
     "You have to decide, either on the moon or Mars, what you're
going to do when you get there and then build a mission scenario
of how you're going to get there and then below that, start
working with functional requirements that decide things like what
kind of propulsion system do you want to work with--a nuclear or
chemical propulsion system?  Do you want solar arrays on the
surface or do you want radioactive isotope generators or do you
want to use fuel cells for power?"
     When and at what level the broader decisions will be made is
not clear yet.  "That's an interesting question," Rosendahl said.
"We have not been getting any strong signals from the (National)
Space Council as to what the boundary conditions and constraints
might be.  I think they're waiting to see what options (the
Synthesis Group) might want to come in with and what the
differences are."

NASA Will Strive For Flexible Management Plan

     With regard to what NASA's inputs will consist of, Rosendahl
said the agency will most likely steer its latest recommendations
toward broader management issues of how the Space Exploration
Initiative (SEI) program should be laid out during the next 3
years.
     "I think we are going to discuss something about how you
might lay out a near-term program...The real issue is the next 3
years.  (NASA's recommendations) are basically a programmatic
approach to laying this out which would make some sense so that
you have a way of developing enough information to make
intelligent decisions.
     "There is also an issue...as to whether you could
overspecify things now by specifying, for example, `Use this
particular engine and that particular component' versus `Here are
3 alternative technologies you ought to pursue.  When you have
the answers to the following sets of questions, then you can make
a decision.'
     "We will probably lay out the program, what our views are as
to what information needs to be developed to make decisions and
we will probably wind up giving our views on technologies.  How
much further, whether we're actually going to talk about systems
and architectures, I'm not sure.  We're more interested in making
sure that we present enough information for (the Synthesis Group)
to work on based on a perspective, rather than any particular
approach.
     "...We obviously have an interest in making sure that...a
sensible set of options come out...from the other end of the
Synthesis Group.  I think our interest is in having a sensible
program that we can go out and execute on behalf of the country"
should Congress and the Administration decide to do so, he added.

ORGANIZERS REPORT FAVORABLE RESPONSE TO OUTREACH EFFORT

     After a relatively slow start, organizers of the space
exploration outreach program say a recently completed 3-month
effort to gather innovative ideas on the subject was a success,
both quantitatively and qualitatively.
     The outreach effort, begun late last spring, consisted of
calls to the traditional aerospace community, as well as the
general public for alternative methods of achieving manned
missions to the moon and Mars.
     The 2 primary methods of solicitation involved the American
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), which requested
ideas from its members, as well as the Rand Corp., which, under
NASA's direction, set up a toll-free public phone number and
issued response packages to anyone wishing to submit an idea.  In
addition, universities, NASA employees and various other
technical groups were called upon.
     In mid-summer, responses to the Rand and AIAA effort were
reportedly light.  But "it's obviously picked up since then,"
NASA's Jeffery Rosendahl said.  The Rand Corp. is expecting to
get some 3,000 ideas from its outreach efforts "which is going to
give them plenty of things to do or to take a look at.  We are
just starting to break it up (the responses) by discipline, but
the responses were rather broadly spread across over every
technology that the sciences consist of...So they're beginning to
go through the job (of sorting through the responses) and to make
some sort of an input to the (Synthesis Group) towards late
September or October," Rosendahl said.
     As of Aug. 17, the Rand Corporation had received more than
10,000 requests for response packets under the outreach program
and 3,302 notices of intent to submit ideas.  Of the intended
responses, 68.7% are expected to come from individuals; 16.3%
from aerospace companies and other for-profit enterprises; and
8.1% from educational institutions.  The remainder are in other
categories.
     Space transportation was the largest category of intended
responses to Rand with 16.7%.  Other categories include mission
concepts (16.5%); life support systems (10.3%); structures and
materials (9.8%); space and surface power (7.4%); space
processing and manufacturing (6.3%); system design and analysis
(5.7%); automation and robotics (4.7%); communications (4.1%);
ground support and simulation (3.4%); and information systems
(2.3%).

AIAA Gets Good Response; But Few Surprises

     In addition to the Rand effort, "the AIAA is hard at work,"
Rosendahl said.  "They've collected hundreds of ideas and they've
got a number of technical committees that have been set up that
are going through those ideas and coming up with their own ideas.
A lot of that is going to culminate at the AIAA Space Exploration
Initiative (SEI) outreach conference Sept. 5 and 6.  And we
ourselves will get the first inkling, I think, of what's coming
out of that at that conference."
     AIAA's Director of Science and Technology Policy, Dr. Jerry
Grey, told SET that the association received a total of some 530
responses from its members.  Of those, Grey estimates that about
450 could be considered "really responsible."
     "The response was much greater than we thought and the
quality was extremely high."  Most of the ideas that were
submitted were not surprising though, Grey said.  "There's almost
no such thing as a new idea.  Many of them (the responses) were
revised concepts" of ideas that have been around for awhile or
"old technology done in a new way."
     Grey said the type of responses received varied greatly from
overall mission architecture concepts to a new way to make a bolt
fasten better.


From Bolts To Architecture--Type of Responses Vary

     AIAA's criteria for evaluating the proposals was extremely
loose, Grey explained.  "We didn't take any programmatics into
account," he said.  The primary criteria used to analyze the
responses were things such as `Does the idea violate the laws of
physics?  Is it applicable to space exploration?  Is it already
being considered or included in the baseline technologies under
study?  And does it have any benefits over the current
baseline?'"
     AIAA's process of evaluating the responses is already well
underway.  About 120 volunteers are assessing the responses, with
5 working technical analysis groups established.  They include:
architectures, transportation, planetary surface systems and
technologies, human support technologies and, finally,
infrastructure.
     An AIAA spokesperson said the largest number of responses
have been in the categories of architecture, planetary surface
systems and infrastructure.
     As of late August, about 200 people had signed up for AIAA's
upcoming SEI outreach conference with final attendance expected
to range between 300 to 400 people.  The conference will include
presentations of AIAA's initial assessments of the responses.
AIAA is slated to make a preliminary report to the Synthesis
group in the beginning of September.  On Oct. 1, it will produce
another version of its assessment which will incorporate some of
the requests made previously by the Synthesis group for more
intense focus, Grey said.  A final AIAA report is due to the
Synthesis group in December.
     Representatives of 10 major aerospace corporations
meanwhile, will meet with the Synthesis group Sept. 10-14 to
present their perspectives on future space exploration.
     While the exact timetable for the Synthesis Group's efforts
had not yet been announced at our deadline late last month, the
group has been working to a spring deadline for presentation of
the major architectures.

Stafford Group Membership Announced

     At a press conference late last month, Synthesis Chairman
Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford announced that the senior membership
of the group would include 21 well known aerospace and defense
officials including, Dr. Robert Seamans, Vice Chairman of the
group, and Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson USAF (ret), current
executive of Hughes Aircraft Co. and former Director of the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
     Other members included: Edward C. "Pete" Aldridge, Jr.,
President of McDonnell Douglas Electronic Systems Corp. and
former Secretary of the Air Force; Dr. David Black, Director,
Lunar and Planetary Institute; Dr. Eugene Covert, professor at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Lt. Gen. Donald Cromer,

EXPLORATION PLANS FACE UNCERTAIN BUDGETARY OUTLOOK

     Although the President's Space Exploration Initiative (SEI)
could give a significant boost to advanced space development
efforts, it is currently facing an unusually tough and uncertain
budgetary outlook.
     The space community has been hoping for a more favorable
reception from the Senate to the Administration's FY 1991 SEI-
related budget request than was granted by the House earlier this
year.  But there was little indication of that prior to Congress'
August recess.
     [The House cut a total of about $337 million in SEI-related
funding from NASA's FY 1991 budget earlier this year including
all of the $188 million in new funding for initial technology
studies.  The total request includes about $800 million to a $1
billion in total SEI-related funding.]
     The key Senate panel, which oversees NASA's appropriations,
is facing a significantly tougher fiscal predicament than its
House counterpart faced earlier this year when it marked up its
version of the FY '91 NASA money bill.  Specifically the Senate
HUD, VA and Independent Agencies panel, chaired by Sen. Barbara
Mikulski (D-Md.), has received a total allocation that is some
$627 million lower than the House had to work with.
     At issue with regard to the SEI funding request, is the
relatively small amount of "new funds" for SEI-related technology
and mission architecture studies.  The $188 million earmarked for
technology studies in NASA's $15.125 billion FY '91 request and
$37 million in mission architecture studies sparked a debate
earlier this year that almost rivaled those which occurred in the
early years of Space Station Freedom development.  The House
subsequently zeroed all such funding complaining that
Administration had failed to make a convincing case as to how the
President's SEI would be paid for in later years.  SEI proponents
have countered that the request represents funds only for initial
study work which would help to answer basic questions surrounding
potential lunar/Mars missions and that the request does not
represent a commitment to actually carrying out the program.
     Nonetheless, a grim overall federal budget picture with the
potential for significant sequestration in October, as well as
little progress reported in the high-level White
House/congressional budget talks, are adding up to a dim outlook
for space exploration-related funding in FY '91.

EXPLORATION PROPONENTS BET ON MIKULSKI

     Proponents of SEI hope that Mikulski can come up with
anywhere from $37 million to $100 million of the SEI funding
which they believe would be enough to keep the initial studies
going, as well as industry interest, etc.
     How likely that will be and how much more of the
Administration's support will be forthcoming for the initiative
given the overall federal budget issues facing the nation and the
less than favorable response it has already received on the Hill
so far is an open question.  While the timing of the recent
galvanization of the technical community through the SEI outreach
program has been the source of concern and uneasiness in light of
the budget predicament, as well as NASA's recent technical
problems, it may actually work to the benefit of SEI proponents
by keeping attention focused on initiatives.
     Regardless, a top space expert told SPACE EXPLORATION
TECHNOLOGY that the National Space Council appears to have had no
choice but to move forward with the highly visible outreach
program, as most of its planning occurred before it became
apparent that sizable congressional opposition to the initiative
existed.  "There is a bit of a disconnect, I think, between the
plans for the outreach program and the political reality.  All
these plans for outreach were put in place early this year before
it became apparent that at least many in Congress weren't
interested in buying into this program.
     "I think there's an interesting disjoint between mobilizing
the technical community and giving the high visibility to their
conclusions and suggestions, setting the Rand program up and
doing newspaper advertising...and the fact that the political
fate of the program still is uncertain.  But nobody is gonna' go
back and say, `Whoops, it's too early to do a high profile
outreach.'  We just go through it.  A lot of people believe that
the timing isn't the best.  But you know you take Presidential
endorsements when you can get'em, not when the timing is right.
     "It is my impression, and it is only an impression, that
they anticipate getting a little money out of the Senate and out
of the (budget) conference in order to not kill SEI as a concept,
but to limp along with some low-level studies during fiscal '91.
But I don't have a high level of confidence in having said that."
     Others remain optimistic.  Although it is clear that a much
more convincing case for the missions has to be made both to the
Congress and the American public, NASA's Jeffery Rosendahl said
he remains hopeful that some of the funds in question will be
approved.  Clearly, "We have a lot more explaining to do,"
Rosendahl said.  But he believes a significant amount of work
could be done even if the agency gets only $35 million to $50
million of the study funds.
     "We've done a remarkable amount of work" just with related
FY 1990 funding, he said.  A major step forward could be made
with a small amount of FY 1991 funding for major technology
identification as well as specific mission architectures, he
added.
     AIAA's Jerry Grey said while the association's members were
clearly disappointed with the recent congressional action on the
SEI request, he believes a better explanation of what the funds
will be used for could help to free up $50 million or so for the
studies.

Most Major Aerospace Corp.'s Will Vie For A Piece Of The
Exploration Pie

     While the traditional aerospace industry has been seen by
some as less than enthusiastic on the SEI effort, nearly all of
the major aerospace companies have expressed interest in playing
a significant role in SEI or bidding on the larger mission
architecture contracts which could be awarded in the years ahead.
And many say they are prepared to make a substantial investment
in preparation for the initiative.
     Martin Marietta's Ben Clark, who has overseen many of the
company's Mars studies, said Martin has and will continue to
invest in advanced space activities such as the Mars study work.
Clark said the company is also investing in the public education
activities which are deemed critical to success of the effort.
Martin, which is a contractor on the upcoming unmanned Mars probe
effort, is presently studying a number of ways to accomplish
manned Mars missions and will present its ideas to the Synthesis
Group in mid-September, Clark added.  Likewise, Lockheed's
Director of Space Station Operations, Gus Gustafero, said his
company is also prepared for what promises to be a series of long
and tough SEI-related political funding battles.
     "We're at a period of time in a program of this size that's
going to be with us for possibly the next 30 or 40 years.  It is
something that Lockheed, from a business viewpoint, has to be
interested in and we do recognize, without getting into the
temporal problem of the NASA budget and what the Congress might
do, that there's a challenge before the executive branch, the
President, the NASA team and the synthesis team and everything
else that's been organized to bring their case before the
American public and the Congress.
     "I guess I would have to say that what has been done to date
has not convinced our representatives that the country is ready
to move in this direction.  I, personally, have been in this
business 36 years and I remain confident that these things need
to play out and what's going on is the right thing to go on."

HUNTSVILLE FOCUSED ON TRANSPORTATION

     (Huntsville, Ala.)     The Huntsville, Ala., space community
is using its knowhow to attack one of the prime obstacles facing
space exploration planners--a lack of adequate space
transportation systems capable of carrying out the U.S.'s future
space goals.
     Bill Huber of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center's Program
Development Office is coordinating the center's SEI studies which
are based, in part, on studies already in place when Space
Exploration Initiative (SEI) was formed, reports SPACE
EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY special correspondent Dave Dooling.  The 3
largest activities are the Space Transportation Infrastructure
Study (STIS) with General Dynamics and 2 Space Transfer Vehicle
(STV) studies with Martin Marietta and Boeing.  "These contracts
were really in place ahead of SEI," Huber said, "but they are
supporting us directly and the results are being fed directly
into our activities."
     The STIS effort initially will develop a data base
incorporating virtually everything that can be compiled about
space transportation systems, costs and projections.
     NASA will then task General Dynamics to impose different
mission requirements--such as landing on Mars or servicing the
Space Station--on the database.  The system will then describe
transportation system requirements to support the mission and
describe what other missions may also be supported.
     "STIS start on the ground," said Boeing's James Kingsbury.
"We start in space."  The STV studies look at "transferring mass
from Point A to Point B, and Points A and B can be most anything
you want."  The latter definition has been stretched to include
points on the planet's surface.
     The STV studies descended from Space Tug studies in the
1970s.  Activities at Boeing and Martin Marietta include
analyzing concepts systems to go from Earth orbit to the surface
of the moon and Mars and include pressurized and unpressurized
rovers.
     Huber said that "the main SEI activity [at MSFC] in the last
6 months has been to go back and examine the `90-day study' [a
preliminary SEI study], do some trades studies and look at other
ways of going to the moon and Mars."
     Marshall is the lead center for Shuttle-C, an all-cargo
derivative of the Shuttle that could support lunar missions and
is NASA's lead center for the Advanced Launch System (ALS).  But
even ALS, most analysts concede, would be inadequate for the
large quantities of cargo that a Mars base would require.
     "We are looking at bigger launch vehicles" for the Earth-to-
Orbit leg, Huber said. "That would reduce the amount of assembly
in lunar orbit."  Studies now focus on Shuttle derivatives and
ALS and have not seriously considered Russia's Energia because of
its inclination problems.  "It's hard to think of a totally
`clean-sheet' design," Huber added.  "There's almost an infinite
number of combinations of engines and staging."  Part of that
consideration includes the Advanced Manned Launch System under
study by Rockwell and Langley.
     Marshall's studies are also focusing on the role of the U.S.
Space Station and whether assembly nodes in low Earth orbit or in
geostationary orbit are better than in lunar orbit.  One way to
reduce launch and assembly requirements would be to use one-way,
direct-ascent cargo landers.
     "Getting there" is the next problem.  One of the biggest
trades in the 90-day study was to select chemical propulsion and
aerobrakes, Huber said, but there is a role for nuclear and
electric propulsion techniques.  "In terms of early candidates,"
nuclear thermal, like the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle
Application (NERVA), is the most likely.  The technology is well
understood and the project was near flight test when cancelled in
the 1970s.  However, open-air testing is not likely to be
repeated.
     A less powerful but more efficient system is championed by
Dr. Ernst Stuhlinger, a former associate director of Marshall and
now an independent consultant.  His electric propulsion theories,
first published in 1954, remain the same even with technology
updates, he said.
     Electric propulsion ionizes a working fluid, then repels it
from like-charged electrodes.  Although the technology has been
flown on a small scale, it remains limited because the thrust is
too low for quick escape from a planet.  Stuhlinger proposes
chemical propulsion to boost a Mars ship to 40,000 km altitude
(about geostationary) and nuclear-electric propulsion for the
trip to Mars.  There would be 2 vehicles, each carrying a crew of
2 or 3, and a freight vehicle with exploration equipment.
     The departure mass would be up to 320 tons, including 140
tons of mercury fuel, which would serve as solar storm shielding.
A 50-megawatt reactor would power the thrusters.
     Stuhlinger calculates that the trip out would take 180 days.
Such a mission should be designed for a high scientific yield and
not be a "Kilroy was here" mission.
     Another key issue also is "To `g' or not to `g.'  That is
the question" when crew health and weightlessness are considered.
Artificial-gravity is included in designs by Gene Austin's space
transportation and exploration office at Marshall.
     One concept has 2 Space Station-type modules that pivot out
to produce "down" along the long axis behind the protection of
the heat shield for planetary aerobraking.  Mike Remus of Thiokol
Corporation has used computers to produce a striking video of
this.
     Transportation on a smaller scale is under study by engineer
Brand Griffin and artist Paul Hudson of Griffin-Hudson (formerly
Spaceworks).  Their work is familiar to many in the space
business through Hudson's paintings of Griffin's
designs.  Griffin said that he is hoping for funding from AIAA's
outreach program for 2 proposals.  The first is a manned/autonomous
work station based on Wernher von Braun's "space bottle," which
would contain an astronaut at full cabin pressure and be equipped
with integral propulsion plus various mission kits and effectors.
It could also operate unmanned.
     The other concept is the "lunar hopper," which would be a
flying jeep for astronauts working on the lunar surface.
     Kingsbury said the rover studies incorporate requirements such
as construction (and instability of vehicles that become
lightweight on the moon and Mars) and extended treks to explore the
surface.  The latter might require hauling a large life support
trailer or, like Antarctic explorers, setting up mini-outposts
along the trail.
     MSFC's Huber said that while there has been some examination
of novel approaches--such as a low, wide Griffin-Hudson lunar
lander design--most lander concepts are "pretty much like Apollo,"
he said.
     Finally, feeding and watering crews on long space journeys is
being studied at 2 universities here.  The Center for Space Life
Sciences at the University of Alabama in Huntsville is defining
water quality requirements for any system that would recycle water.
And Alabama A & M University is analyzing rabbits as a potential
space food that could be grown and harvested in relatively short
cycles (every few months) and yield high-protein, low-cholesterol
meat.

JOHNSON LOOKS TO DIFFERENT LUNAR/MARS "PHILOSOPHIES"

     Johnson Space Center officials said they have spent a
significant amount of time during the past year reviewing new
"philosophies" related to future space exploration.  "In the 90-
day effort, we put together one way of doing the mission and that
was based on some work that had been done over a period of
years," noted Doug Cook, director of the Moon and Mars
Exploration Program office.
     "We knew that was a possible way to go which would work and
which would hold together.  But we knew there were other options.
So, as an agency, we are currently looking at other
alternatives."
     JSC officials explained, however, that they are looking into
new philosophies as opposed to alternative architectures.  "As
far as new technologies go, we really don't know what might come
up," said one official.  "We're trying to come up with a
different approach, alternative management and decision-making
programs.  The object is to do it [land on the moon and Mars] as
best, as fast and as cheaply as we can.  With a looser management
approach. We're not locked into any kind of set architecture.  If
we find a way that would get us there faster or cheaper, it can
be built in."
     The Moon and Mars Exploration Program Office, located at
JSC, is responsible for coordinating NASA's input and bringing
forth recommendations for the Synthesis Group, as well as for
tracking the lunar/Mars studies that are being conducted at the 9
field centers.
     Cook explained that the program office is divided into
mission and development, which is concerned with "actual in-space
operations," and systems engineering and integration.  "Here, we
are making sure that the end-to-end design of the entire set of
elements [all the major hardware, such as space vehicles and
habitats] are consistent and that they match up in their
capabilities and interfaces.
     "You don't want to build, for instance, some kind of vehicle
servicing unit that sits on the moon that supplies, say, 75KW to
a lander.  Then the lander gets there and it doesn't need but
5KW.  So we want to make sure we balance the capabilities with
the requirements."
     Under a second office recently set up at JSC, the Moon and
Mars Exploration Projects Office, JSC officials are studying
planet surface systems, including inflatable habitats, power
systems on the surface, roving vehicles and construction tools,
and provide support to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in robotics
studies.  In addition, the Human Robotics Spacecraft Office is
planning JSC's part of the Mars Rover Sample Return.
     Cook noted that 60 JSC employees are currently working on
SEI-related projects.  "We are in a study mode," he explained.
     Cook also stated that no (major) contracts have been awarded
on any projects that are being studied under NASA's current
proposal.  The budget allocated to Johnson for SEI-related
studies is projected at $6.9 million for FY '90, a figure Cook
defined as "insignificant compared to JSC's budget."
     Although JSC has been evaluating NASA's data and will
recommend alternative plans, Cook said that the program office
has not been asked to evaluate any outside proposals.  "We assume
we may be asked for some help in certain areas.  But I think that
is possible with the other big agencies too, so I don't see
ourselves as the primary source of technical capability for that
group."  JSC has been working towards a September deadline for
new lunar/Mars inputs, but Cook expects that NASA's study period
to continue through the end of the year.  He also pointed out
that a center's study responsibility is not necessarily the area
that the center will develop. "We don't know what the spread of
responsibility is going to be across the agencies within the
government," he said.  "It would be premature for NASA to divide
up what they think the pie is going to be."

FUEL CELL RFP STALLED DUE TO BUDGET UNCERTAINTIES

     Lewis Research Center is still contemplating release of a
request for proposals (RFP) for a regenerative fuel cell system
to be used on the moon's surface, although recent cuts to the FY
1991 Pathfinder budget request may stall the effort, according to
program officials.
     Lewis issued a solicitation for proposals on the system in
July and received an "overwhelming response," according to
project manager Paul Prokopius.  Prokopius said at least 10
qualification statements have been received from various
companies.
     But an RFP release date is uncertain due to recent budget
actions by the House HUD, VA and Independent Agencies panel.  The
panel cut the Administration's $179.4 million Pathfinder request
down to $25.4 million earlier this summer.  The Pathfinder
program consists of a broad-range of advanced space technology
research efforts.
     Prokopius said the RFP could still be released later this
year should funding be made available.
     Prokopius said the system, which would help to provide power
during the lunar night or the period when no sunlight is received
on the moon, will consist of a power producing fuel cell stack
and an electrolyzer to regenerate water produced by the fuel cell
into hydrogen and oxygen required for fuel cell operation.
     The total value of the multi-year contract was initially
estimated at $10 million, Prokopius said.  Proposals were
requested for a complete fuel cell and electrolyzer system or for
the fuel cell and electrolyzer separately and more than one award
could made at the discretion of the government.  For more
information contact: Paul Prokopius, NASA Lewis Research Center,
21000 Brookpark Rd., Cleveland, OH 44135.

SOVIETS LOOKING TO SELL PHOBOS SPACECRAFT

     The Soviet Union's space program, in need of hard currency,
has decided to forego plans to fly the third in a series of
probes to the Martian moon Phobos and instead has put the
spacecraft up for sale on the open market, according to SET
correspondent Seth Arenstein.
     An official of the Los Angeles-based import-export firm
Phoenix International, in a telephone interview with SET, said
his company has received the rights from Moscow to sell the third
Phobos spacecraft.  In addition, he said, the Venera-7 satellite,
which was launched in August 1970, is also available for sale.
"The spacecraft are ready to be shipped" to the United States,
the official said.
     A leading analyst of the Soviet space program, who has
discussed the venture with Phoenix International, is convinced of
the authenticity of the spacecraft.  "They (Phoenix
International) provided too many details about the spacecraft to
be faking," he said.
     The Phoenix official said a number of parties had expressed
interest in the hardware, although he would not mention specific
names, nor prices.  "The Phobos craft would probably be more
valuable because it is newer," the executive added.

Potential Buyers Could Include Museums And Universities

     Other sources said museums and universities would likely be
interested.  Although a Japanese firm acquired backup hardware
for the Soviet Mir space station last year, Tokyo is not a likely
customer for the Phobos craft, sources said.  "They can build a
better spacecraft themselves," one said, referring to the fact
that both Phobos missions ended in failure.
     The Phobos craft put on the market by Moscow served as the
backup hardware for the 2 nearly identical probes sent into space
on July 7 and 12, 1988, respectively.  Both missions failed,
however, when they lost contact with mission controllers.  The
first probe lost contact with Earth on Sept. 2, 1988; the second
of the 6,200 kg probes was incapacitated on March 26, 1989.
Soviet officials said poor workmanship and a series of incorrect
ground commands were the culprits.
     The proposed sale surprised a number of analysts since
Moscow had expressed interest in launching the third Phobos
craft.  In July 1989, Valeri Barsukov, a senior Soviet space
official, said the uprated ground test vehicle could "in theory"
be flown prior to the planned 1996 Phobos sample return mission.
     "We could fly sooner, in 1992, but we do not want to repeat
the mission profile of the and schedule of the Phobos mission, we
want to add something... (like) a sample return mission,"
Barsukov said.  "But, we need time to get ready for such a
mission," he added.

DESIGN FOR MIR FOLLOW-ON SAID TO BE COMPLETED

     Meanwhile, Soviet engineers have apparently completed work
on the design of the large Mir-2 space station, which will be the
follow-on to the current Mir facility and will be transported by
the Energia heavy-lift vehicle, according to Soviet news reports.
     Mir-2 will weigh several hundred metric tons and fly at high
altitudes to avoid drag.  The station is likely to be placed into
an orbit of more than 400 km and consist of several 100-metric-
ton structures, dwarfing today's Mir station, which weighs in at
approximately 90 metric tons.
     Soviet officials have varied on a launch date for Mir-2,
with some saying initial elements could be orbited as early as
next year, while most have set 1995 as the target date.

POWER GROWTH, ECLSS CHANGE CONSIDERED

        Space Station officials are considering increasing the power
capability of the four Space Station photovoltaic modules and an
early closure of the Environmental Control Life Support System
(ECLSS) oxygen loop, according to Reston Space Station chief Robert
Moorehead.
        In an interview with SPACE STATION NEWS late last week,
Moorehead said the agency is considering increasing the capability
of the four photovoltaic modules (two of which are located on each
end of the Station's truss) by an additional 3 kilowatts (KW) which
would provide a total addition of 12KW onboard the Station at
assembly complete.
        The Station is currently slated to have a total of 75KW power
at assembly complete.  Of that total, it is estimated that
housekeeping or Station operations will consume 45KW and users will
share 30KW.
        Prior to the recent Station changes, users were to receive
some 37-1/2KW.  Station officials officially readjusted that figure
last fall during the rephasing activity.
        The availability of power onboard the Station has been a major
concern among various Station users and Hill officials during
recent months.
        Adding to concerns over the new official lower user power
estimate have been unofficial reports out of the Reston Space
Station office that estimates of power available to users, when the
international modules were in place on the Station, had actually
dipped as low as 15KW (SSN, 12/18/89).
        Moorehead said the extra 12KW would help solve "the perceived
power difficulty" and could be dedicated almost entirely to Station
users.
        Although he did not indicate specifically whether the
additional 12KW would be added to the 30KW currently slated for
users or simply be used to help fulfill the 30KW user requirement,
a NASA official said later that, as currently conceived, it would
be added to the 30KW slated for users.
        Moorehead did say, that he personally believes that 45KW for
housekeeping is excessive and said Station officials would scrub
and scrub and scrub to reduce that figure.  The decision to
increase the power capability of the photovoltaic modules is
strictly an agency budgetary decision, Moorehead said, and poses no
significant technical risks.

Return To Original ECLSS Plans Also Contemplated

        In addition to increased power, Moorehead said Station
officials are also considering a shift back toward original ECLSS
plans.  The old baseline program included a closed oxygen loop
ECLSS early in the Station's assembly.
        In the current Station baseline, the ECLSS oxygen loop will
remain open initially and be closed by assembly complete.  Late
closure means that prior to assembly complete, oxygen will have to
be transported to the Station and at assembly complete it would be
regenerated on the Station.
        Station officials said last fall that the change would produce
significant front-end cost savings and some reduction of power
consumption at the Permanent Manned Capability milestone, but
conceded in congressional testimony that it would also increase
total assembly launch weight by 6,600 lbs. due to gas storage
requirements and increase resupply weight every 90 days by 2,470
lbs.
        Station officials also said the change would require
development of a new cryogenic oxygen carrier needed for resupply
prior to the period when regenerative capability was added.  Cost
of the carrier was estimated at about $16 million.  Now, Moorehead
said, "a proposal (is) being submitted by the Marshall Space Flight
Center that we move that forward and close the loop and never do
this block one (initial open, then closed loop) thing that says
transport oxygen to the Station."  Both changes, "are under
consideration, but they have not been made a part of the program
(or baselined)."

HOUSE PANEL CALLS FOR MORE STATION HEARINGS

        The House Space, Science and Technology Committee will waste
no time in taking up the Space Station again when Congress
reconvenes later this month.  It has currently rescheduled a
hearing with the Space Station international partners for Jan. 30,
at 1 p.m.  The hearing was originally planned to be conducted late
last fall when a similar hearing was held on recent Space Station
changes, but was cancelled due to scheduling problems, according to
Hill officials.  In addition, look for the panel to schedule a
hearing with Station officials early in its series of hearings on
NASA's 1991 authorization.  Committee staffers say they hope to
track where the program has gone since the October hearing and to
reexamine remaining issues.
        The panel's concern over some the recent Station changes has
apparently not fully subsided since its hearing on the issue last
November.  A top Committee staffer reiterated Committee Chairman
Robert A. Roe's (D-N.J.) disappointment over some of the recent
changes.  The issue, he said, has become one of "credibility" with
the Committee.  Of high concern to the Committee is the idea of
wasted tax dollars associated with continuous changes.  "We do have
a sense that you've got to start cutting metal at some point in
earnest and at that point you've got to know what the configuration
is that you're working toward.  Now, where that point comes...I
mean in no way do we want to take away from NASA's management
prerogatives to make judgments on the thing, but by the same token
I think there's just a fundamental question of spending the
taxpayers money efficiently.  You can't keep floundering around
spending a $1 billion a year on this thing and not knowing what
your doing."
        With regard to the international hearing, a Committee staffer
said the panel hopes to examine how recent changes and uncertainty
in timing of the multi-billion project will affect political
support for the program within the various participating countries.
        European Space Agency (ESA) officials confirm that they will
attend the hearing--with ESA director general Reimar Luest
scheduled to appear--but there was no firm word at our deadline as
to whether representatives from Canada and Japan would appear.
        Canadian Space Station official Mac Evans said he doubts that
the Canadians will accept the invitation, although no final
decision had been made yet.  Canada's Department of External
Affairs will make the decision.  Evans reiterated the Canadian
government's long-standing policy concerning government officials
testifying before foreign bodies and said a rare precedent would be
set if Canadian officials did testify.
        A Japanese official said no word had not come from Tokyo as of
last week as to whether Japanese officials would attend.  But he
said the decision could go either way.

ESA Likely to Press Larger Multi-Year Funding Issues

        An ESA official said the agency will probably use the upcoming
hearing on international Station concerns to address some of the
broader issues relating to the program such as long-term funding,
rather than as a forum to wrestle over individual concerns.
        All three of the Station international partners have expressed
remaining concerns over the revised Station plans, with both the
Japanese and Europeans wanting earlier module launch dates than the
February and June 1998 dates planned, respectively.  But although
NASA has been reviewing and negotiating with the partners over such
concerns, the likelihood of any major changes in this area remains
to be seen.
        With regard to ESA's request, Space Station officials have set
a condition for the Europeans before changing the module launch
date.
        Reston Space Station chief Robert Moorehead tells SPACE
STATION NEWS that although NASA's look at the situation indicates
there are some trade-offs in the Station assembly sequence which
could be made to accommodate an earlier ESA launch, Station
officials want a firm commitment as to when the module will be
ready for launch before going any further with the change.
        Although ESA has selected a prime contractor for the Columbus
program, it has not completed negotiations on the program.  Sources
say when Station officials toured European contractor facilities
last fall they were given a later date from ESA contractors as to
when the module would be ready than they had received from ESA
officials, prompting their present position.
        An ESA official indicated that the Europeans are confident the
ESA module would be ready.  Obviously, "It would be rather foolish
of us to propose a date if we didn't think we could make it."  With
regard to ESA's latest launch proposal, he said it "was a different
assembly sequence that got the APM (Attached Pressurized Module) up
earlier," and did not involve launching of the ESA man-tended free-
flyer prior to the APM launch as has been discussed.
        While the Japanese have expressed interest in an earlier
Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) launch date, they seem to have
been less insistent upon it, as compared to ESA.  A Japanese
official summed up their position on the matter by saying "If that
(the February 1998 JEM launch date) is the minimum delay that NASA
can (offer), then I think that we will have to endure.  We were
very much upset by the fall rescheduling operation by NASA, but on
the other hand we have to be realistic about the prospects of the
future budget of the Space Station."

CURRENT STATION MILESTONES DETAILED

        Below the current milestones for the Space Station Freedom, as
provided by NASA, are detailed.  Also included are milestone dates
estimated in October and those associated with the previous
baseline.  Current milestones differ from October estimates
primarily with regard to Early Man-Tended Capability (EMTC) and
launch of the ESA APM, with a slip from the October estimate of
EMTC and a slightly earlier APM launch date than was estimated by
top Station officials in October.  The current milestones shown do
not reflect any of the on-going reviews or changes under
consideration, such as earlier launches of APM or JEM modules.

RESTON CHIEF SEES FIRM BASELINE AS KEY CHALLENGE

     Since being named last October to head the Reston Program
Office, Robert Moorehead has overseen the program's Level II
activities during one of the Station's most fluid and turbulent
times.  When Moorehead, a former Space Shuttle official from
Johnson Space Flight Center, took the position of Deputy Director,
Programs and Operations, he was the fourth person to head up the
organization in less than a year.  Since coming onboard, he has
overseen the difficult task of molding the Station's assembly
sequence to meet the current rephased or rescoped Space Station
program.  In an interview last week with SPACE STATION NEWS,
Moorehead said his greatest challenge in the coming year will be to
ensure a stable Station baseline is in place.  Excerpts of the
interview are printed below.

INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS

SSN: What is the current situation with regard to earlier launch
dates of the international modules?

Moorehead: "The internationals have had some concerns about when
they would be put on orbit and we have conducted some studies and
we have some ways to move them earlier in the assembly sequence.
You have to make trades when you do that.  So, if you move them
earlier in the assembly sequence then you have to give up
utilization flights earlier so you can't do as much, if you will,
with their modules, but yet they would be on-orbit.  We've
conducted that as an off-line study, but it's not a part of the
program.  It's just an off-line study.  There have been no firm
decisions."

SSN: What is the situation specifically with regard to ESA's
request?

Moorehead: "The way we view that is that there's some things that
we could do.  But we would not propose to make any changes until
they (ESA) have a more firm schedule in place.  As you know they
have selected a contractor, but they have not negotiated their
program.  They're in the process of doing that.  There's some
things that could be done, some shifting of priorities, but we
don't think we can go much further in that activity until we get a
firm commitment from them on when they can deliver their product.
Something can be done, you have to make some trades.  You have to
give up utilization flights or outfitting flights or things of that
nature.  But we don't propose to go any further until they are
willing to make a firm commitment on schedule."

USER CONCERNS

SSN: Looking at some of the user concerns, have there been any
changes with regard to the switch in the hab/lab modules as it
relates to the life science centrifuge facility?

Moorehead: "We have met all the user requirements.  That's an
interesting story.  At the outset, I said that what we are trying
to introduce into this program is some discipline and rigor.
There's a way to get requirements into this program...On the
centrifuge, the requirement is that we accommodate the 1.8 meter
diameter centrifuge and that we don't upset the microgravity
environment onboard.  We can accommodate that centrifuge in either
one of two places.  We can accommodate it in the lab or we can
accommodate it in a node.  The baseline's in the lab by now.  And
our analysis, and the Code E or the scientist people have concurred
with that analysis, is that yes indeed, we can meet the
microgravity requirement and have that centrifuge reside either in
the node or in the lab.  So we have met our requirements.  Now
there's some things that have been published, some things that have
been discussed in the media SPACE STATION NEWS, January 8, 1990

that are not requirements in the program.  If they want to have
additional requirements on the program, the process is come to the
program with a change request.  They talk about location of the
centrifuge relative to hab or lab and animal storage facilities.
They talk about growth of the centrifuge to a larger diameter, but
those things are not requirements.  They have not been written down
and have not been written into the program.  The point I want to
make is that we have met all the requirements that have been stated
through official channels.  We're here to serve the user and if
they have other requirements and they're willing to state them,
then we'll work those requirements."  (It should be noted that life
science officials have said they were aware that some of their
concerns had not actually been written formally into the program,
but nonetheless were assumed to be available or provided.)

SSN: So that switch in the placement of the hab and lab modules is
a permanent thing?

Moorehead: "As far as we're concerned...unless there's another
requirement that's accepted by the program that would cause us to
change that.  Yes, that is a permanent thing.  The other thing that
they complained about is that in the rebaselined program they
alleged that we deleted some of the lab support equipment.  Number
one, we've added the lab support equipment back."

SSN: Into whose budget?

Moorehead: "It's in Station's budget.  There was some general
purpose lab support equipment that was slated to be handled by the
Station so we've added it back.  Now, the users are saying 'we
aren't ready to define it.  It'll be '91 until we can tell you what
we really want.'  So you might say we played poker and we called
their bluff and they're not ready to define what equipment they
want.  I'm saying that the Station proposes to provide $30 million,
or whatever the dollar number was, of lab support equipment that at
one time we had deleted, we propose now to add that back."

SYSTEM CHANGES

SSN: Have there been any major systems changes since the
information on the new Station program was presented at the
congressional hearing last fall?

Moorehead: "We decided before we formally baselined the assembly
sequence to do away with the passive radiators (on the thermal
control system).  That was the last change in systems that we've
made.  We have some ongoing studies.  We always have on-going
studies.  There are two other changes that we are con-
sidering...(One) of those being what I call growth of the power of
the solar arrays such that we get additional power."

SSN: At what stage in the process?

Moorehead: "From the very beginning.  Increasing the capability of
each power module by about 3 kilowatts.  So that would help the
perceived power difficultly that we have.  At assembly complete
we'd have 12 additional kilowatts of power, if we choose to do
that.  The other major change that's under the consideration is
closing that oxygen loop on the ECLSS.  That again was a block type
thing."  Under current Station plans, "for a while we transport
oxygen to the Space Station and then just before assembly complete
we would close the loop, if you will, and regenerate the oxygen
onboard the Station.  Where now there is a proposal being
(submitted) by the Marshall Space Flight Center that we move that
forward and close the loop and never do this block one thing that
says transport oxygen to the Station.  Those are under
consideration, but they have not been made a part of the program."

SSN: With regard to power, there has been considerable concern over
power levels available to users and additional reports (out of the
Reston Program Office that, with the international modules in
place), power levels may have actually dipped further.

Moorehead: "Well let me say that I think you're confusing some fact
with some opinion.  The baseline at assembly complete is
essentially 30KW for the users and 45KW to operate the Station.
Part of the Station operation, by the way, is power that we provide
to the users just to keep their facilities alive.  In my personnel
opinion, and this is opinion, is that the 45KW to operate the
Station and keep the users alive is excessive and so what we will
do with that, and what we've always done on programs such as this,
is that we scrub, we scrub, we scrub, we scrub...Now should we buy
the additional 12KW that would be available if we grew the solar
(arrays) then almost all of that could be dedicated to the user.
And that decision is not a technical decision.  It'll be a
budgetary decision, because certainly we can provide that
additional 12KW without any significant technical risks at all.  So
if the agency makes the budgetary decision to fund the growth of
the power modules by 3KW, then we have additional 12KW for the
users or whoever.  But there's nobody else that lays claim to it,
so it would be user power."

FUTURE CHALLENGES

SSN: There have been a lot of changes out here in terms of the
leadership of this program office in recent times.  Do you plan to
be around for a while and what do you see as the major challenges
which you will face this year?

Moorehead: "Well, (jokingly) I plan to be around for a while, but I
think everybody would have given you that answer.  I did not take
this on as a short-term activity.  I enjoy this sort of work and
it's sort of the only game in town.  So I plan to be here.  In
terms of the short-term challenges, they relate to the very things
we've been talking about.  And that is getting a good baseline
established and getting the resources allocated.  We have many
resources to allocate across the program.  We talked about one--
power.  And we've done power and we've done weight.  But we have
volume allocations to make, we have EVA (Extra-Vehicular
Activities) time allocations to make.  When we say that we can meet
the micro-g requirement--You start out if you had no disturbances
at all you would essentially have no accelerations, but you have
accelerations onboard the vehicle.  So one of the things that
(Station officials are working on) is to allocate how much
acceleration contributions can the Workpackage 3 elements make or
the Workpackage 2 elements and so forth.  So we have all those
sorts of resource allocations to make to set this program on a firm
footing so that we have a good set of ground rules.  And I think
that's a real challenge is to get the right ground rules, the right
requirements in place.  And they're second level requirements...but
they're requirements that have to be in place before you can go cut
metal and build a real spacecraft."

NATA SEEKS EXTENSION OF COMMENT PERIOD ON FLIGHT AND DUTY TIME NPRM

   Citing the potentially "wide reaching effects on the Part 135 industry,"
the National Air Transportation Association asked FAA to extend the comment
period on a proposal to implement more restrictive flight and duty time
standards for commercial air carrier crew members. The NPRM, which was
announced last month, would base flight and duty limits on the amount of
time pilots and other crew members are on duty, rather than the current
system based on flight hours (BA, Dec. 18/263).
   In a letter to FAA Administrator David Hinson, NATA President James
Coyne noted that the NPRM culminates "over a decade's worth of debate
between the FAA and the industry. We are disappointed that the FAA notice
failed to differentiate between the regulation of scheduled operators and
those providing on-demand transportation." Coyne asked Hinson to extend
the comment period - which was set at 90 days in the NPRM - by another 90
days, noting that "in the absence of an emergency, and with the
importantance of the regulation, this would be a prudent action by the
agency."
   Coyne said NATA also "strongly recommends the FAA hold a series of
public meetings to gather information from those thousands of companies
that will be affected by the proposal. We are shocked and dismayed that
the FAA was unable to estimate the potential costs of the proposed rule on
air taxi operators. In our view, the best method to gather this
information is for the FAA to hold regional meetings to examine the affect
and the costs of the NPRM on this segment of the industry. NATA believes
it is critical for the agency to take this step to meet its obligation to
thoroughly analyze this important rulemaking action."

ATLANTIC AVIATION SIGNS NEW PACT WITH WILMINGTON MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES

   Atlantic Aviation Corp. said its maintenance personnel overwhelmingly
ratified a new labor agreement that extends into 1999. The new pact covers
some 200 technicians and maintenance personnel represented by the United
Auto Workers at Atlantic's principal maintenance facility and headquarters
in Wilmington, Del. Those workers perform a wide range of maintenance,
custom manufacturing, avionics installation, interior refurbishment and
painting of corporate aircraft.
   Ben E. Waide, III, who took over as chairman and chief executive of the
fixed-base chain in November (BA, Nov. 20/221), noted that the
negotiations, conducted after a long period of difficult restructuring by
Atlantic, "were conducted with a mutual respect and a focus on continued
improvement in the effectiveness and quality of our product." The
agreement, retroactive to Dec. 1, runs to March 1, 1999.
   The previous agreement provided hourly workers with a 1.15 percent
"supplemental bonus," but held wages at the same level and guaranteed
continuation of "flexible work processes" that had been instituted in 1992
(BA, May 24, 1993/203). In a telephone interview with BA last week, Waide
said the new agreement is "extremely positive" because the negotiations
reflected an understanding by both sides of what needs to be done to keep
the business strong. In addition to maintaining the work flexibility
provisions, he said the new pact provides a wage increase in each of the
three years and continues a "gain-sharing program" that increases payments
to workers as profitability increases. Waide said both sides agreed to
extend the termination date of the new agreement to March to avoid the end-
of-year business and holiday distractions incumbent in a December
expiration date.

LAMBERT TAKES OVER TOP JOBS AT AVIALL FOLLOWING TAYLOR'S DEPARTURE

   Robert G. Lambert, 65, who headed Dallas-based Aviall for nearly 20
years until his retirement three years ago, has taken over as president and
chief executive of the company. Aviall said he replaced Marshall B.
Taylor, who, the company said, "resigned to pursue other interests."
   Lambert led Aviall, Inc. and its predecessor companies from August 1973
until December 1992, when he became a consultant to Ryder System's
worldwide aviation services. One year later he was named board chairman of
Aviall, Inc., when that entity was spun off from Ryder System, Inc. He
will now hold all three titles.
   Lambert said Aviall "is continuing to study various strategic
alternatives to improve shareholder return and better position the company
for the future." He added that "Aviall's performance since it was spun off
from Ryder System has been disappointing to the board and Aviall's
shareholders. We intend to focus management's attention on these matters
while continuing our strategic evaluation of Aviall's business."
   Aviall claims to be the largest distributor of parts and supplies and
the largest independent provider of maintenance and overhaul services for
commercial aviation turbine engines. The company said it had $863 million
in sales in 1994. A spokesman said Aviall expects total 1995 revenues of
approximately $850 million, with the decline reflecting some discontinued
product lines. Through the first nine month of 1995 Aviall reported
revenues of $647.5 million and net income of $8.5 million, or 44 cents per
share. Aviall has approximately 3,000 employees, including more than 1,200
in the Dallas area and another 700 at a major overhaul facility in
Prestwick, Scotland.

ERA COMPLETES PURCHASE OF ALASKA HELICOPTERS ASSETS

   ERA Aviation, Inc., Anchorage, Alaska, said it completed the purchase of
certain assets of Alaska Helicopters, Inc. for approximately $10 million.
ERA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rowan Companies, Inc., Houston, Tex.,
said the purchases includes the hangar and office space adjacent to ERA's
existing facilities at Anchorage International Airport, 15 Bell helicopters
and related spare parts. ERA paid $3 million in cash, with the balance in
a promissory note due December 1996. Rowan Companies also announced last
week it had completed the sale of its three submersible barge rigs for
approximately $12 million. Rowan provides international and domestic
offshore contract drilling and aviation services for the petroleum
industry.

NATA'S JIM COYNE MAKES SUCCESSFUL LANDING AFTER ENGINE FAILURE

   National Air Transportation Association President James Coyne made a
successful landing at Steamboat Springs, Colo. last week after the No. 2
engine on his Beech Baron failed. Coyne, his wife, Holly, and three
children were about 25 miles from Hayden Airport enroute to a ski vacation
when the engine blew, covering the right cowling with oil. "It's not
something you like to see, when the oil pressure drops to zero," Coyne
said, "and it drops real fast."
   The engine failed when the Baron was at 11,000 feet enroute to the
6,602-foot airport and Coyne said he was thankful the problem did not arise
30 miles earlier in the flight when the aircraft was over terrain higher
than the Baron's single-engine service ceiling. As it was, the landing was
relatively uneventful, Coyne said, noting the "severe clear" conditions
that prevailed, the airport's 10,000 foot runway and his belief that
"Barons fly real well" on one engine. Another positive factor was the fact
Coyne had completed an instrument recurrency check just four weeks earlier
that included engine-out practice. He said the engine failure apparently
was caused when a piece of cylinder ring broke off and wedged between a
cylinder and the piston wall.
   Contacted by BA in Steamboat Springs, Coyne said last week's incident is
the second time in 20 years he's experienced an engine failure in his
Baron, adding that his entire family was aboard on both occasions. It is
also the second time this year Coyne will have had to leave his airplane
behind for repairs when he returns home. His Baron was partially covered
by flood waters while parked at the airport in New Orleans during NATA's
convention there last spring, which necessitated extensive repairs and
repainting (BA, May 15/207).

GARRETT SAYS NEW STC WILL PERMIT 731 JETSTARS TO MEET STAGE 3 NOISE LIMITS

   Garrett Aviation Services is marketing a new supplemental type
certificate for operators of Garrett 731-powered JetStar business jets that
will permit those aircraft to meet FAR Part 36 Stage 3 noise regulations.
The STC was issued to Star 3 STC, Inc., a company formed for the purpose of
acquiring the STC, which in turn has signed an agreement making Garrett
Aviation Services the sole marketing agent. The STC, applicable to both
731 JetStar conversions and JetStar II business jets, limits the aircraft
to a maximum takeoff weight of 44,500 pounds and a maximum landing weight
of 36,000 pounds, but imposes no significant performance penalties. A
Garrett spokesman said the STC, priced at $24,500, involved changes to the
aircraft flight manual and the posting of a placard adjacent to the
aircraft data plate. Garrett officials believe there are 99 Garrett 731-
powered JetStars in operation worldwide. For more information, contact
Jeff Holm, airframe and modification manager at Garrett's Los Angeles,
Calif. facility, at (310) 568-3845.

DEFENSE DEPARTMENT CAUTIONS AGAINST USING GPS AS SOLE MEANS OF NAVIGATION

   The military followed up recent satellite-based Global Positioning
System accuracy problems with a warning to its operators "not to be
overconfident" about the system. The advisory followed incidents in which
several types of GPS receivers experienced position signals that were in
error by as much as 20 to 40 nautical miles. The Defense Department's GPS
Joint Program Office (JPO) said the problem was caused by "corrupted data
in the receiver and can occur when crypto keys....are loaded into an
unkeyed receiver." While the encryption key problem would not affect
civilian users, sources who support retaining a backup for GPS say the
military experience shows that something might go wrong and leave only dead
reckoning as an alternative if FAA carries out plans to phase out all other
types of navigation aids. The JPO said it is "aggressively investigating
other possible scenarios that can corrupt the data resulting in navigation
errors with no warning."
   "This problem is specific to the military, but we are saying something
else might go wrong" that would impact civil users, a source said. "This
is an instance in the military arena where something could go wrong, and it
did. The message is that a complementary or auxiliary system is needed in
case something does go wrong." The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association,
the National Association of State Aviation Officials and several other
industry and user groups have pleaded with DOT - to no avail - to keep
funding the Loran C navigation system. DOT's latest Federal
Radionavigation Plan calls for eliminating Loran C funding after 2000.
Previous FRPs called for Loran C funding to 2015.
   Richard Arnold, who leads the integrated product team for GPS and
navigation at FAA, and Joe Dorfler, product leader for GPS at the agency,
said they have been aware "for some time" of the problem the military is
having. Dorfler said the Wide Area Augmentation System, scheduled to be
commissioned in 1998, will alert airmen if GPS signals are not to be
trusted. He said that before WAAS is available, FAA-certified GPS
receivers will have receiver autonomous integrity monitoring as an
augmentation.
   Arnold said FAA is "working on a gradual schedule. We will be
absolutely assured that the system we will put together will be robust and
will be backed up by ground-based navaids." Arnold acknowledged that Loran
C and nondirectional beacons are to be phased out in 2000, "but we will
still have the VOR system and the ILS, which do not show phaseout until
2010." Arnold said, however, that "if WAAS proves out, we may accelerate
all that transition. But we are not going to do anything until the [air
traffic control] system is equally as safe as it is now, and we think it
will be better." In a widely circulated message to military commands, the
JPO said GPS "provides the most useful and accurate navigation solution
available, but we caution operators not to be overconfident in the system.
Appropriate cross-check of GPS with other forms of navigation (inertial
navigation sets, radar, radio navaids, Doppler, dead reckoning, visual
methods, etc.) should be employed to ensure safety and mission
accomplishment."

FAA EXTENDS COMMENT PERIOD FOR INSTRUCTOR, SCHOOL REGULATIONS

   Federal Aviation Administration has extended until Feb. 12 the comment
period for proposed regulations for pilot, flight and ground instructor,
and pilot school certification (BA, Aug. 14/67). Helicopter Association
International requested the extension, saying that the proposal contains
several far-reaching changes and that "the sheer bulk and detail of those
changes warrant more than 120 days to prepare well-reasoned comments," FAA
said. For more information on the proposal, contact John Lynch in the
General Aviation and Commercial Division at (202) 267-3844. Comments
should be sent in triplicate to FAA, Office of the Chief Counsel (Attn.:
Rules Docket AGC-200), Docket No. 25910, 800 Independence Ave., S.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20591.

AIR FORCE SEEKING PROPOSALS FOR UPGRADING T-38 AVIONICS SYSTEMS

   The U.S. Air Force issued a request for proposals and is seeking bidders
for design and installation of upgraded avionics on the venerable T-38
Talon trainer. The winning contractor will have total system performance
responsibility and receive three separate contracts, according to the USAF
Aeronautical System Center.
   "Our program goal is to upgrade the AT/T-38 aircraft avionics and
aircrew training devices to provide pilots with the essential avionics and
cockpit management skills necessary for transitioning to follow-in major
weapons system aircraft," said Kathy Cliett, program manager for the T-38
upgrade.
   The basic contract will call for a 36-month engineering and
manufacturing phase. Six production options to buy 425 shipsets of
avionics will be included. Source selection is scheduled from February to
next summer, to be followed by a three-year engineering development phase.
Production is scheduled to begin in September 2004. The winning contractor
also will be awarded an avionics support and a T50/T51 simulator
maintenance contract.

FAA PLANS HELICOPTER NAVIGATION PROJECT, INCREASED SECURITY DURING
OLYMPICS

   The Federal Aviation Administration and a number of other government and
industry partners will use the occasion of the 1996 Summer Olympics in
Atlanta to demonstrate the capabilities of satellite navigation, data link
and other technologies for helicopter operators. FAA will spend about $2
million in the Atlanta area for temporary duty personnel, overtime,
security enhancements and installation and operation of four mobile air
traffic control towers from July 15 through Aug. 9. An additional 75
employees will be on temporary duty before and during the Olympics. FAA
expects a 25 percent increase in air traffic in the Atlanta area during the
event.
   FAA will operate temporary ATC services at six general aviation airports
and implement a reservation system for general aviation aircraft operations
throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area. VFR arrival slot reservations
will be required at five airports, and non-scheduled IFR arrival/departure
slot reservations will be required at 13 airports. FAA will establish
restricted airspace over Olympic venues and publish VFR helicopter routes
about six months before the Olympics.
   The helicopter navigation project, known as the Atlanta Short Haul
Transportation System, is a joint initiative of FAA, the Helicopter
Association International and other industry groups, a number of local
businesses and various agencies, including NASA and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. FAA will set up landing zones and routes to accommodate
increased demand for short-haul air transportation, such as emergency
medical services and express package delivery.
   In addition to anticipated large numbers of helicopters that will
operate by VFR only during the Olympics, about 50 helicopters will use the
Global Positioning System to navigate through this route structure. Using
data link, movement of the specially equipped helicopters will be monitored
by a personal computer-based system. The helicopter routes will be
established over interstate and multi-lane highways and will be designed to
avoid residential areas. Half of the $10 million cost of the demonstration
program will be borne by FAA and the remainder divided among other
participants in the program. FAA estimates that the system will have an
economic impact in the area of $15 million to $19 million.
   Plans for security include a "Security Command Center" at FAA's Southern
Region office in Atlanta to coordinate aviation security efforts with
airports near venue sites, which are located in several states. FAA also
recently approved $1.2 million in Airport Improvement Program funds for 11
security enhancements at Hartsfield Atlanta Airport. The AIP projects are
airport security fence improvements, terminal vehicle intrusion barriers,
ballistic-film on terminal windows, a north cargo area guard post, portable
X-ray machines and a film processor, police booths, enhanced security at a
storage area for explosives and K-9 training aids, a remote-controlled
robot for retrieval of explosives, a vehicle for transporting explosives to
a bomb disposal site, communications equipment and police vehicles.

UTC WOULD CONSIDER AEROSPACE ACQUISITIONS

   United Technologies Corp. is not interested in selling its aerospace
units, but is looking for future acquisitions, company President and Chief
Executive George David said last month. UTC's two aerospace units -
Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney - have been the subject of merger and sell-off
rumors recently. Earlier last year, David would not rule out putting
Sikorsky up for sale. In August, rumors of a merger between Pratt &
Whitney and fellow engine maker Rolls-Royce resurfaced, but both denied
that such a move was underway. Asked last month whether a shrinking defense
market would drive UTC to other fields, David said the company has been
heavily involved in defense for many years, adding that, "we have no
intention of not being right smack in the middle of that. Armed conflict
is going to be in our future."
   Rather than selling the two business units, David said "it might even be
nice if we could make an acquisition or two or three," adding that the any
such addition would have to be a good fit for UTC. He said he would
consider acquisitions in either the engine or helicopter business, adding
that the main obstacle to date has been a lack of candidates.

THE COST of the budget gridlock between Congress and the White House was

THE COST of the budget gridlock between Congress and the White House was
expected to increase sharply with the advent of the new year. Barring any
last-minute agreement to end the budgetary stalemate, a variety of excise
taxes on aviation were due to expire Dec. 31. Nel Sanders, senior manager
of state and tax issues for the National Business Aircraft Association,
told BA the taxes scheduled to expire include the 10 percent passenger
ticket tax, the 6.25 percent cargo waybill tax, the 15-cent and 17.5-cent
levies on each gallon of aviation gasoline and jet fuel, respectively, and
the $6 international departure fee. Those taxes generate some $6 billion
annually for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which provides about 70
percent of FAA's annual budget. A 4.3-cent-per-gallon "transportation
fuels tax" on jet fuel and avgas will continue to be collected.

SINCE THE TAXES

   SINCE THE TAXES on noncommercial aviation fuel are assessed at the
refinery and included in the pump price, aircraft operators will probably
have to file for refunds from the Internal Revenue Service to recoup the
15-cent and 17.5-cent per gallon levies.

accumulated balance in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to finance the
agency's operations and acquisitions until the ticket, waybill and
departure tax levies are reinstated.

THE DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR

   THE DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR also said the agency plans to meet an April 1
deadline to establish procurement and personnel reforms called for in the
fiscal 1996 transportation appropriations bill. She said eight working
groups - comprising outside consultants and FAA personnel - have been
formed to address issues raised by the reform provisions of the
legislation. The objective is to make FAA "the highest performing
[government] agency at the lowest cost," according to officials. One
initial goal - cutting equipment acquisition time by one-third - is being
revisited in an effort to reduce cycle times even further.

AIR TOUR OPERATORS

   AIR TOUR OPERATORS expect 1996 will be challenging as they attempt to
ward off additional federal regulation spurred by environmental interests.
In addition to an ongoing rulemaking effort by FAA and the National Park
Service to develop a national policy regarding park overflights, FAA has
been asked to adopt a preemptive ban on overflights of Rocky Mountain
National Park, located just northwest of Boulder, Colo., even though no air
tour flights are operating there. Depending on FAA's response to that
request, the agency may be asked to impose similar bans in other areas that
could affect both air tour and other air traffic. In addition, Grand
Canyon tour operators are very concerned about Park Service proposals to
dramatically expand the size of "flight-free" zones around the canyon and
compress air tour and transient traffic into relatively narrow corridors.

FAA OFFICIALS

   FAA OFFICIALS tell BA they're sticking with a Jan. 1, 1997 date for
implementing new Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM) for flights
operating over the North Atlantic, even though many corporate aircraft that
regularly transit the North Atlantic will not be able to obtain, install or
get FAA approval of navigation equipment that will meet the stricter
standards by those dates. Implementation of RVSM is designed to permit
1,000-foot vertical separation at altitudes between FL 290 and FL 410. Tony
Broderick, FAA's associate administrator for regulation and certification,
said aircraft currently approved for transatlantic flights can continue
such operations, but they will be restricted to operating on the current
track system with the same in-trail and vertical separation standards that
now apply.

drug testing rate continues to be less than one percent positive, has
decided to continue requiring random tests of 25 percent of covered
employees through 1996. The agency formerly required that 50 percent be
tested, but the new level still is far above the 10 percent test rate
advocated by industry.

ONE OF THE FIRST

   ONE OF THE FIRST recommendations from the National Academy of Public
Administration's study of National Air and Space Museum operations is the
speedy appointment of a new director "who can implement changes in the
organization." Smithsonian Secretary I. Michael Heyman, who requested the
study, named a seven-member committee to recommend a short list. Several
industry groups have suggested former NTSB member and FAA Administrator
Donald Engen for the job (BA, July 17/24). The panel includes four high-
level museum employees, and they or their immediate superiors will report
to the new director.

BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON MODEL 206B AND 206L

   BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON Model 206B and 206L helicopters (Docket No.
93-SW-04-AD; Amdt. 39-9438; AD 95-24-06) - supersedes an existing AD that
requires a revision to the Limitations section of the FAA-approved
Supplemental Type Certificate Rotorcraft Flight Manual Supplement until
replacement of the engine power-out warning sensors on certain Model 206B
and 206L helicopters equipped with Allison 250-C20R engines. This
amendment also requires a revision to the Limitations section, but removes
the requirement for replacement of the engine power-out warning sensor.
This amendment is prompted by a reevaluation of the need for an engine
power-out warning sensor based on the lack of reported operational
occurrences of the false engine-out warnings. The actions specified by
this AD are intended to maintain a heightened pilot awareness that false
engine-out warnings may occur when practicing autorotations and could
result in an unnecessary emergency autorotative landing.

JETSTREAM HP137 MK1, SERIES 200 AND MODELS 3101 AND 3201

   JETSTREAM HP137 Mk1, Series 200 and Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes
(Docket No. 95-CE-10-AD) - proposes to supersede an AD that requires
repetitive inspection of the nose landing gear actuator support structure
and the front pressure bulkhead and replacement of any cracked part. This
proposal would retain the repetitive inspections, and would require
repetitive inspections of the nose landing gear retraction jack upper
mounting fitting and attachment hardware for security bolt failure or for
bolts with improper torque levels. The proposal would require replacement
of any failed security bolts, adjustment of an any bolt with an improper
torque level and modification of the nose lading gear retraction jack as a
terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The proposed action is
prompted by reports of nose landing gear jack mounting fitting failures and
by FAA's policy on aging commuter-class aircraft. The actions specified in
the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the nose landing gear
caused by a cracked nose landing gear actuator support structure or cracked
front pressure bulkhead, which could lead to nose gear collapse. Comments
on the proposal must be sent in triplicate before Feb. 9 to FAA, Central
Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th St.,

current inspection for cracks in the threaded areas of the propeller hub
followed by modification of the hub to contain oil with red dye as a
terminating action to the repetitive inspections. This amendment is
prompted by reports of cracked propeller hubs. The actions specified in
this AD are intended to prevent propeller blade separation due to a cracked
propeller hub, which could result in separation of the engine from the
aircraft and subsequent loss of aircraft control.

airplanes (Docket No. 90-CE-59-AD) - proposes to supersede an AD that
requires repetitive inspections of the main landing gear inboard door
hinges and attachment angles for cracks and replacement of any cracked main
landing gear inboard door hinge or attachment angle. FAA's policy on aging
commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate, or in certain instances, reduce
the number of certain repetitive short-interval inspections when improved
parts or modifications are available. The proposed action would retain the
repetitive inspections and require the incorporation of an improved main
landing gear inboard door hinge and attachment angle assembly or approved
hinges and angles made of steel as a terminating action for the repetitive
inspection requirement. The actions specified by the proposal are intended
to prevent separation of the inboard main landing gear door from the
airplane caused by a cracked inboard door hinge or attachment angle. This
condition could jam the main landing gear and cause loss of control of the
airplane during landing. Comments on the proposal must be sent in
triplicate before Feb. 21 to FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant
Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th St., Kansas City, Mo. 64106. Specify

39-9425; AD 95-23-05) - supersedes an existing AD that requires an
inspection and repetitive visual checks for slippage of the tail rotor
drive and replacement of the tail rotor gear-box, if necessary. This
amendment requires disassembly of the T/R gearbox to verify the
installation of the input and output shaft keys between the input and
output pinions and their respective shafts. This amendment is prompted by
two incidents in which the key was not installed between the output shaft
and the output pinion during assembly of the tail rotor gearbox at
Robinson. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent
slippage of the tail rotor drive, loss of directional control and
subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

SENSENICH MODELS M76EMM, M7EMMS, 76EM8, AND 76EM8S() METAL PROPELLERS

   SENSENICH Models M76EMM, M7EMMS, 76EM8, and 76EM8S() metal propellers
(Docket No. 95-ANE-03) - proposes to revise an existing AD that restricts
operators from continuously operating the propeller at engine speeds from
2,150 and 2,350 revolutions per minute (RPM). This action would delete
propellers installed on certain Textron Lycoming O-360 series reciprocating
engines with solid crankshafts from this requirement, and update the
referenced Sensenich service bulletin with the latest revision. Reworking
of all affected propeller models remains a requirement of the proposal,
regardless of engine installation. This proposal is prompted by inquiries
concerning tachometer red arc restrictions on certain Lycoming O-360 series
reciprocating engines with solid crankshafts. The actions specified by the
proposal are intended to prevent propeller blade tip fatigue failure, which
can result in loss of control of the aircraft. Comments must be sent in
triplicate before Feb. 5 to FAA, New England Region, Office of the
Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, Mass.

TEXTRON LYCOMING 235 SERIES, 290 SERIES, AND CERTAIN 320 AND 360 SERIES
RECIPROCATING ENGINES

   TEXTRON LYCOMING 235 series, 290 series, and certain 320 and 360 series
reciprocating engines (Docket No. 94-ANE-44) - proposes to require initial
and repetitive inspections of the crankshaft inner diameter for corrosion
and cracks, and replacement of cracked crankshafts with a serviceable part.
This proposal permits operation of engines with crankshafts that are found
to have corrosion pits, but are free of cracks, provided that repetitive
inspections are performed until the next engine overhaul or five years
after the initial inspection, whichever occurs first. At that time
crankshafts with corrosion pits, but no cracks, must be replaced with
serviceable crankshafts. This proposal is prompted by reports of
crankshaft breakage stemming from corrosion pits on the inside wall. The
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent crankshaft
failure, which can result in engine failure, propeller separation, forced
landing and possible damage to the aircraft. Comments on the proposal must
be sent in triplicate before Jan. 29 to FAA, New England Region, Office of
the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington,
Mass. 01803-5299. Specify docket number.

BOEING NEARLY DOUBLES AIRBUS ORDERS, DELIVERIES IN 1995

     Despite losing some important orders to Airbus Industrie in 1994
and 1995, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group roughly doubled the number
of orders Airbus received last year. Boeing reported orders totaling
261 aircraft valued at $18 billion, compared to Airbus's total of 106
orders with a total value of $7 billion.
     The 1995 orders are in contrast to a much more comparable figure
for 1994. In that year, Airbus received slightly more orders, 125,
valued at $9.1 billion, than Boeing, which received 120 orders with a
value of $7.8 billion.
     Boeing's 1995 deliveries also were nearly double that of Airbus.
Boeing completed and delivered 206 commercial aircraft to customers,
while Airbus delivered 124 aircraft to 30 customers. However, Airbus
sales in 1995 totaling $9.6 billion were a one-year record for the
European aircraft consortium.
     The sales increase was due primarily to a higher proportion of
widebody aircraft deliveries, principally the A330 and A340, 49 of
which were delivered, 15 more than in 1994. The number of deliveries
of A320 and A321 aircraft increased to 56, while 19 A300s and A310
widebodies also were delivered. The number of Airbus operators
increased from 123 to 131 in 1995.
     Among the orders received by Airbus in 1995, 81 were for the
A319/320/321 family; 19 were for A330/A340 aircraft, and 6 were for
A300s/A310s. New Airbus customers included Midway Airlines, TACA
International; Air Jamaica; Aer Lingus and Yemenia Airways.
     At the end of 1995, Airbus had an order backlog of 578 aircraft
valued at $46.4 billion. Of 1,935 total Airbus orders from 122
customers in the consortium's history, 1,357 have been delivered.
     Boeing's total of 206 deliveries in 1995 includes 36 aircraft in
the fourth quarter, which was lower than anticipated due to its
machinists' strike. The fourth quarter's 36 deliveries consisted of
nine 737s, five 747s, four 757s, twelve 767s and six 777s. For the
year, Boeing delivered eighty-nine 737s, twenty-five 747s, forty-three
757s, thirty-six 767s and thirteen 777s.

TAIWANESE COMPANY PLANS PANAMANIAN AIRLINE

     A Taiwanese airline company plans to begin an intercontinental
airline in Panama, sources say. Evergreen Marine Corp., which founded
Eva Airways, will boost its involvement in Panama in part because of
the confidence Evergreen Chairman Chang Jung-fa has in the Panamanian
government, the sources tell World Airline News. Chang was named an
investment adviser to Panamanian President Ernest Perez Balladares
last year.
     The airline is expected to begin international service from
Panama by July, the sources say. Equipment being considered for the
venture include 767 and 757 equipment from Boeing and A340 and A330
aircraft from Airbus Industrie.
     Eva has applied with Panamanian authorities to begin an airline
that will fly to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Colombia, sources
say, adding that the airline has long-term plans to operate to the
U.S., Europe and Asia. Eva also has asked Panama's incumbent
international airline, copa, to become a minority shareholder, the
sources say, but has not yet received any response. The offer was made
in November.
     Eva Airways now operates long-haul service from Taipei to Los
Angeles and last year began linking that daily trip with Panama.

AIRBUS BEGINS 1996 WITH FLURRY OF AIRCRAFT ORDERS

     Airbus Industrie launched 1996 with a surge of orders from four
customers. Philippine Airlines had by far the largest order of the
four -- 24 aircraft, including four long-range A340-300 widebodies, 8
A330-200 twin-engine widebodies, and 12 A320 narrowbody planes. The
orders make it only the second airline in the world to have ordered
these three Airbus types.
     Delivery of PAL's Airbus aircraft begin in the second quarter of
1997, with nearly simultaneous delivery of the first A340 and A330.
The first A320 will be delivered in the third quarter of 1997. PAL has
an additional four A340s from a previous order, which get delivered to
PAL at the end of 1996.
     The airline plans to use the new A340s to develop its long-haul
route system, including new nonstops to Europe and North America,
Airbus says. A330s will be used on high-density Asian services and on
medium-to-long range routes as far away as the Middle East.
     PAL also ordered eight 747-400 aircraft from Boeing valued at
$2.7 billion.
     Caribbean carrier BWIA International Airways ordered two A340-300
aircraft, Airbus said Jan. 3, becoming the first Caribbean/Latin
American customer for the four-engine aircraft. The aircraft will be
delivered to BWIA in late 1996. BWIA also receives its first two A320
narrowbodies in June.
     Yemen's Yemenia Airways ordered two A310-300 aircraft and took
options on an additional two, becoming a new Airbus customer. Delivery
of the two aircraft is planned for March 1997. Yemenia will use the
aircraft on nonstop services to Europe, southeast Asia and the U.S.,
as well as on regional routes. The airline will have the airplanes
configured to 191 passengers in three classes of service. Choice of
engines has not been made.
     Airbus's fourth customer, leasing concern GATX Capital Corp.,
ordered nine A321-200 aircraft, the stretched version of the A320
narrowbody. The order was valued by Airbus at $580 million. Deliveries
of the -200, a higher performance version of the -100, begin in April
1997. GATX chose the CFM56-5B engine to power the aircraft.

BRITISH AIRWAYS DECEMBER TRAFFIC RISES 6%-8%

     British Airways was expected to report traffic growth of between
6% and 8% for December, rounding out a period of steady traffic growth
in 1995. However, analysts in Britain claim that most of the  rise in
traffic in December came from increased leisure, not business, travel,
due in part to intra-European and North Atlantic fare sales.

AUSTRIAN'S BAMMER TO FOCUS ON REGULATORY HARMONIZATION,
EUROCONTROL AS AEA PRESIDENT

     Austrian Airlines President Herbert Bammer, who was elected 1996
president of the Association of European Airlines, plans to focus on
harmonization of aviation regulations among European Union states, on
airline certification issues, and on development of a unified European
air traffic control system. "The regulatory work to reshape European
air transport is only half finished," says Bammer. "The time has come
to complete the task, with a genuine effort to remove the remaining
constraints which are keeping costs up, and efficiency down."
     Noting that all three "packages," or phases, of European airline
liberalization measures have now been implemented, Bammer said, "the
industry is standing with one leg inside the single market, while one
leg is still out in the world of inter-governmental political
wrangling."
     Bammer adds, "The politicians have the opportunity to create
effective regulatory bodies out of the JAA [Joint Airworthiness
Authorities] and Eurocontrol [the European ATC system]. JAA is
supposed to become the European counterpart of the respected and
democratically-controlled FAA in the USA." The agency, however, he
says, "has only recently begun its rulemaking task, but already it is
bogged down in bureaucratic muddle and institutional delays, while
democratic control and decision-making is not forthcoming."
     In addition, Eurocontrol has never received the power from the
various European states over which it is supposed to have airspace
control. Bammer says, "I agree with those directors-general in ECAC
[European Civil Aviation Conference] who believe that the know-how of
Eurocontrol -- and JAA -- should be combined with the decision-making
mechanisms of the European Union. Ultimately," he says, "we would see
an agency of the European Union, respecting of course the rights of
non-EU member states."
     And Bammer criticized recent decisions to delay liberalization of
airport ground handling services which, he says, "shows how much
airports are regarded as pieces in the political game.
     "The airports which enjoy monopoly handling, with the guaranteed
income that this means, make profits that the airlines can only dream
about. Not only are we overcharged, we are also prevented from
tailoring our product to our customers' liking."
     Bammer, who recently marked 30 years of service at Austrian, has
been closely involved with AEA since he was named president of
Austrian in 1992. He was chairman of the group's Commercial Affairs
Committee when it introduced the AirPlus credit card. He also
conducted the AEA Global Distribution Study, which resulted in the
launching of the Amadeus and Galileo computer reservations systems.
     Bammer succeeds Roger Sietzen, president of Luxair. Sietzen used
his presidency to promote development of European aviation
infrastructure, speaking widely on the topic throughout Europe in
1995. "Under Seitzen's guidance," says AEA Director-General Karl Heinz
Neumeister, "frequent contacts with [European Union] Transport
Commission Neil Kinnock have been established, and the debate on
infrastructure has been brought firmly into the political arena."
     Two AEA studies were published in 1995, "European Airports --
Getting to the Hub of the Problem, or the Problem of Getting to the
Hub," and "EU External Aviation Relations -- an AEA Policy Statement."
     Late in 1995, AEA attempted to break a deadlock on development of
stricter flight and duty-time rules for cockpit crews but was unable
to persuade senior officials in the Joint Airworthiness Authorities to
consider the document.

AEA REPORTS 7.7% GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC IN NOVEMBER

     Growth in North Atlantic and Europe-Sub Saharan African markets
highlighted November's international traffic statistics for European
carriers, the Association of European Airlines reported last week.
Traffic to sub-Saharan Africa grew by 15.6% to 2.407 billion revenue
passenger kilometers (RPKs), with capacity in the market growing at
only an 11.7% pace. Load factor, therefore, jumped 2.4 points to
70.8%.
     The statistics indicate continued strong growth in traffic
recovery by Europe's largest airlines, in contrast to a much smaller
level of growth among U.S. carriers that serve international markets.
Only one international market shrank in November -- the Mid-Atlantic.
Traffic in that market decreased 2.9% to a total 1.427 billion RPKs,
but capacity rose 5.5%, so load factor dropped 5.9 points to 66.2%.
     In total, European airlines flew 23.429 billion RPKs in November,
up 7.7%, while capacity rose only 6.5%, to 42.215 billion available
seat kilometers (ASKs). Load factor rose slightly, by 0.8 points, to
65%.
     For January-November 1995, traffic also rose at a 7.7% pace
compared to the same 11-month period in 1994. Total international RPKs
were 344.598 billion, and ASKs rose 5.6% to 487.482 billion. Load
factor increased 1.4 points to 70.7%.
     Traffic in North Atlantic and Sub-Saharan Africa markets outpaced
all others for the first 11 months, showing increases of 9% and 9.4%,
respectively. Next was Geographical Europe, with 8.5%, and 8% in South
Atlantic markets. Among the weakest markets were Mid-Atlantic, with
only 1.6% growth, and Europe-North Africa and the Middle East, which
grew at only a 1.8% clip.
     In freight markets, the South Atlantic was by far the best
performer, growing 14.9% in November and 24.9% for the first 11 months
of 1995.

AER LINGUS NAMES NEW EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

     Aer Lingus, one of the most consistently unprofitable airlines in
Europe, last week named a new executive vice president for North
America. Jack Foley, 42, will be responsible for the airline's passenger
sales and marketing efforts in the continent and will report to David
Bunworth, Aer Lingus's Dublin-based director of sales and marketing.
     Foley comes from British Airways, where he was involved in key
aspects of the successful airline's sales, marketing and information
management areas for 21 years.
     "Aer Lingus regards North America as a key market for further
development," says Bunworth. "This developing market requires dynamic
management at this critical time."

BRITISH AIRWAYS OUTLINES PAY INCREASE PROPOSALS

     British Airways has proposed a 3.1% raise over two years for
unionized workers in ground services, cabin crew, and specialized
"craft" and "non-craft" areas, such as maintenance and engineering. If
accepted by unions, the two-year raise would be retroactive to Jan. 1.
The offer also makes some changes to the airline's profit-sharing
formula and to basic pensions.
     Harvey May, BA's director of human resources, says, "British
Airways' pay rates for many jobs are in the top 10, or 25%, for similar
work in other UK companies. Although the airline is currently enjoying a
successful period, it is vital not to build in permanent costs that
increase the difficulty of any future business decisions when times are
not so good."
     May was quoted in most recent issue of BA News, the airline's
employee newspaper.   The airline's approach to pay rates,
he says, "is to protect against inflation and to tackle any issues of
market comparability when they arise separately from the two-year pay
agreement."
     Profit-sharing arrangements for the 1995-96 fiscal year, BA says,
predict that the average employee will receive 3.75 weeks of pay in
profits. As an example, an individual earning Pounds 310 per week or
below will receive a lump sum payment of Pounds 1,162. If they choose to
invest the funds in BA stock, however, the contribution rises to Pounds
1,395, representing a 20% bonus this year.
     Approximately 66% of BA staff are now company shareholders, BA
estimates, with Pounds 66 million distributed in shares last year, a
threefold increase from the year before.

ROUTE DEVELOPMENTS

     * Greece's Olympic Airways and Brazilian carrier VASP launched
codesharing services between the two countries Jan. 4. The flights,
which operate on Mondays and Thursdays, will use VASP McDonnell Douglas
MD-11 aircraft. The flights originate in Athens and stop in Casablanca
and Rio de Janeiro before ending in Sao Paulo.

     * A third Italian airline is scheduled to enter the Rome-Milan
market, making a further challenge to incumbent Alitalia. Noman Airlines
will begin service Jan. 22, operating six daily flights. The first
competitor to Alitalia was Air One, which began Rome-Milan shuttle
service in November. Although Alitalia and Air One fly out of Fiumicino
Airport, Noman has chosen to begin service from the smaller Ciampino
Airport.

     * China Northwest Airlines will begin service from Xi'an in the
Shaanix Province of North China to Macao starting Jan. 9, Xinhua News
Agency reports. The flights, to be operated twice weekly, will make an
intermediate stop in Changsha. China Northwest is the third mainland
carrier to begin service to Macao, with China National Aviation Corp.
and China Northern now flying there.

     * Air Macao will launch a daily flight between Macao and Koahsiung,
Taiwan, Jan. 12. Air Macao operates twice-daily service between Macao
and Taipei.

     * Air India has begun service to Entebbe International Airport in
Uganda. The airline will operate an Airbus A310 from Bombay on Mondays.
Air India suspended service to Uganda in 1972 when former Uganda
President Idi Amin expelled thousands of Indians from the country.

     * Emirates Airlines of the United Arab Emirates has gained approval
for flights to Australia following the successful conclusion of
bilateral aviation talks between Australia and the UAE in December.
Emirates will fly three weekly nonstops between Dubai and both Melbourne
and one other unnamed airport, using any aircraft.

     * Canada 3000 will enhance service from Edmonton, Alberta, to
Halifax, London Gatwick, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Honolulu effective
with the May 28 schedule change. A total of 14 weekly flights will be
operated, double the number operated last spring.

ventilation system. Dee Howard also re-engines aircraft, doing so for 44
727-100 aircraft in the United Parcel Service cargo fleet.

   * China Eastern Airlines ordered two VITAL ChromaView visual systems
from FlightSafety International for use in the airline's A300-600 and
MD-82 cockpit flight simulators. One will be installed on a new A300
simulator in the fourth quarter of 1996, while the MD-82 simulator,
already in use, will be refitted. The ChromaView visual system provides
a higher level of reality and richer scene content. It received the
Federal Aviation Administration's Level "D" certification, the highest
for flight simulators.

   * Nordam Group, which operates flight repair stations worldwide, has
opened a repair facility in Singapore to take advantage of new business
in the region. The Nordam Repair Division in Singapore will cover 20,000
square feet near Changi Airport. The new facility will focus on repair
of engine thrust reversers for engines used on Boeing 737-300s, -400s
and -500s, in addition to component inspection and repair for actuators
and gearboxes.

ATLANTA-BASED NEW-START INDEPENDENCE AIR GETS NEW PRESIDENT

   Independence Air, the potential new-entrant airline that wants to
begin widebody transcontinental service using Airbus aircraft, has named
a new president whose goal is to begin service by the second quarter of
this year.
   Roy Hagerty, a 25-year industry veteran, replaces Barry Harris, a
former acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, who
decided to return to his consulting business in Washington after less
than two months with the fledgling firm.
   It was the second such leadership change at Independence Air. Before
Harris, the Department of Transportation indicated to the company that
the appointment of Stephen Quinto, one of the airline's founders, would
be controversial due to the bankruptcy of his last airline,
Northeastern, in 1982.
   Hagerty, who most recently served as president of Airline
Development Group, a consulting firm based in Raleigh, N.C., says the
company needs some $6 million in startup funds to get off the ground.
The company is still looking at Airbus A300B4 aircraft, which can carry
some 270 passengers depending on configuration, but also is a good cargo
aircraft.
   Before his job at Airline Development Group, Hagerty was chairman,
president and CEO of CCAIR, Inc., a U.S. regional airline that operated
as Piedmont Commuter and later USAir Express. Hagerty grew the business
from a money-losing effort in 1983 to a $60 million firm that reported
profits of $4 million in 1991. Before CCAir, Hagerty ran Coastal Air,
which operated Southeastern Airlines, from 1972 to 1983.
   Hagerty told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week that he
plans to hire several former Eastern Airlines officials who had recently
left Independence Air after Harris resigned.

ATA PREDICTS FIRST U.S. AIRLINE PROFIT SINCE 1989

   U.S. airlines should report an annual profit for 1995, their first
since 1989, the Air Transport Association reported last week. A growing
economy, high air fares, limited sales and low fuel prices were the
major contributors, ATA says.
   "1995 was a good year for U.S. airlines, and it came just at a time
when the industry needed a good year," said ATA President Carol Hallett.
"After five long years of losses totaling $13 billion, airlines need
profits to repair balance sheets, buy new aircraft and get ready for the
21st century." Hallett said 1996 looks "hopeful" if the economy remains
healthy, if airline unions cooperate on cost-saving proposals, "and if
the government tax collector keeps his hand out of the industry's
pocket."
   However, Hallett's words seem somewhat hollow after last week's
events concerning the U.S. ticket tax. The 10% excise tax on all tickets
expired on Jan. 1 after Congress was unable to enact a new law
continuing the tax. At first, U.S. airlines simply pocketed the
additional money; however, they began dropping fares by a commensurate
level later in the week. By the end of the week, nearly all large U.S.
airlines had passed the savings associated with the tax on to consumers.
   ATA said a record 548 million passengers boarded U.S. carriers in
1995, a 3.7% increase over 1994's total of 528 million. Revenue
passenger miles totaled 540 billion, up 4%, and passenger load factors
averaged 67%, a post-World War II record. Preliminary data show that
cargo traffic increased a healthy 11%, to 15.2 billion ton miles, while
mail shipments grew at a 4.5% pace to 2.4 billion ton miles.
   For the first three quarters, U.S. airlines reported net income of
approximately $2.2 billion. Noting that Wall Street projections call for
a break-even fourth quarter, "1995 year-end profits are likely to remain
in the $2 billion range," ATA claimed.

PENA APPROVES MAJORITY OF LAX LANDING FEE INCREASES

     U.S. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena's finding that
much of Los Angeles International Airport's proposed landing fee
increase is reasonable marks a milestone for the airport, but also
seems destined to propel the dispute into the halls of Congress. The
Dec. 22 decision could also reverberate in city halls across the
country.
     LAX has been involved in a series of disputes with carriers over
the legitimacy of certain landing fees. Airlines claim the fees are a
subtle form of revenue diversion, in which airlines are forced to pay
for some non-airport safety services. This is not allowed under
federal law. Pena's decision reinstates some services paid for by
airline fees that carriers contend are not airport related.
     Tensions concerning the decision were evident in statements made
by Airport Commission President Ted Stein, who was quoted by the L.A.
Times as saying the airlines "basically conceded this time that they
got their butts kicked."
     Carol Hallett, president of the Air Transport Association, which
represents U.S. airlines, appears to be in a fighting mood as well.
"The time has come for city hall to end its shenanigans," she says,
claiming that by virtue of these landing fees, Los Angeles area
citizens are paying "hidden taxes." She says the DOT's decision "pays
lip service to the congressional mandate prohibiting cities. . .from
diverting airport revenues to pay for general public services. We are
left with no choice but to go back to Congress for the second time in
three years to get this mess cleaned up."
     Chris Chiames, spokesman for ATA, says his organization will try
to change the decision-making process to isolate it from political
pressures, which Chiames believes influenced Pena. ATA also wants to
strengthen the language in federal laws that prevent revenue diversion
to avoid similar situations from arising at other U.S. airports.
"There are dozens of cash-strapped cities and counties across the
country" that might be tempted to follow in Los Angeles' footsteps,
Chiames suggests.
     The FAA's reauthorization bill will expire next fall, and Chiames
views this occasion "as a vehicle to revisit the issue."
     The airport's landing fees will be scaled back to $1.97 from the
current $2.06 per thousand pounds of landed weight. Another 29 cents
is currently under dispute by the airlines, who continue "to pay that
amount while awaiting judicial resolution.
     Pena's decision rejects part of an earlier ruling made by
administrative law judge Burton S. Kolko in late November. [WAW, Dec.
5, 1995, p. 8] At that time, Kolko found 14 cents of the $2.06 landing
fees unreasonable. Pena's decision, however, reinstated five cents of
the amount in question. The airport must refund airlines the
difference between the $2.06 and $1.97 charges, which amounts to $4.6
million. If all 14 cents of the landing fees had been disallowed, as
the airlines wanted, the airport would have been forced to refund $7.2
million.

NEW YORK SEES SAVINGS IN OUTSOURCING

     The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is turning to
private industry to help reduce operating costs at Newark
International Airport, as part of an overall restructuring that will
save the Authority $105 million in 1996. 
     The Authority will expand the role of private developers in
managing terminal concessions at Newark and increase the use of
private contractors and consultants to undertake design and management
of capital projects. There will be more outside bidding for
maintenance contracts to foster competition. Finally, there will be
opportunities for the duty-free shopping industry as Newark plans to
expand its facilities to meet growing international passenger
traffic.                                                              
     Combined with moves to reduce airport administrative costs and
overtime, the Authority expects to save more than $10 million at
Newark in 1996, with additional annual savings of $16 million in the
future. 
     "We expect to increase Newark Airport's net revenues to the Port
Authority," says the Authority's Executive Director, George J. Marlin.
"At the same time, we will improve customer service and facility
maintenance," he adds.
     The recommendations made for Newark may also be applied to JFK
and LaGuardia airports, says Lewis M. Eisenberg, chairman of the
Authority. The recommendations were part of a study conducted by Leigh
Fisher Associates in conjunction with KPMG Peat Marwick, Mitchell
Titus & Co. and Anita T. Connor, Inc.

BAA AIRPORTS REPORT AVERAGE PASSENGER INCREASE OF 6.8% IN NOVEMBER

     Traffic at the seven airports operated by BAA rose 6.8% in
November to 6.5 million passengers, compared to the same period one
year ago. BAA's three London-area facilities - Heathrow, Gatwick and
Stansted - matched that growth rate and handled 5.7 million passengers
during the same period. Gatwick passenger volume jumped 9.3%, Stansted
rose 44% and Heathrow increased 4%.
     Aircraft movements rose 4.1% at the seven airports, led by a 21%
increase at Stansted and 10% rise at Gatwick. Southampton movements
dropped nearly 6% in November, while Heathrow recorded an increase of
under 1%. Aircraft movements for the entire system totalled 73,154
last month.
     Cargo showed moderate growth of 6.4% to 123,446 metric tons, led
by Stansted, up 12.8%, and Heathrow, up 7.8%. Declines were posted at
Gatwick 
(-1.5%), Glasgow (-12.3%) and Edinburgh (-20.1%).

AFCO FINALIZING AIR CARGO PLANS WITH PITTSBURGH

     Aviation Facilities Management (AFCO), McLean, Va., is in the
process of refining its air cargo marketing plan for Pittsburgh
International Airport, which wants to expand its cargo operations in
part at the expense of other eastern seaboard facilities. AFCO, which
signed a contract with the airport in October, expects to complete the
plan this week. 
     AFCO's "initial focus" will be to attract all-cargo and small
package carriers, which can immediately provide additional lift
capacity, says Tom Samuels, AFCO's project manager. The company is in
discussion  with several such carriers to join FedEx, Airborne Express
and UPS, which currently operate out of Pittsburgh. AFCO will also
seek business from passenger carriers with belly space, Samuels says.
     AFCO also wants to reverse a trend in which "millions of pounds"
of cargo are trucked from the Pittsburgh area to other eastern
seaboard airports for transport. That trend developed from
insufficient cargo lift out of Pittsburgh, he says. AFCO also expects
natural increases in cargo tonnage from the market trend in the United
States, which is expected to double over the next 12-15 years.

CHEK LAP KOK CONTRACTS GO TO HONG KONG, JAPANESE FIRMS

     Hong Kong's Airport Authority awarded two contracts in late
December, including the last major construction project for Chek Lap
Kok Airport.
     Nishimatsu Construction Co. received a $225.7 million contract to
complete the ground transportation center (GTC) that will contain a
railway station and other public transport facilities. Nishimatsu will
build the structure, railway works, roads, and electrical substation,
a switching station and an emergency generator plant room. In
conjunction with this contract, the Mass Transit Railway Corp. signed
an entrustment agreement with the Authority to reimburse the latter
for the a significant portion of the GTC costs.
     Also, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals (HACTL) won the contract to
operate the air cargo terminal at Chek Lap Kok Airport. A second
franchise agreement with Asia Airfreight Terminal Co. Ltd. to operate
a second terminal is expected shortly. HACTL, which has the monopoly
to operate the air cargo facility at existing Kai Tak Airport, will be
responsible for the 320,000-square-foot facility that can handle up to
2.6 million tons annually.

GREINER TO BUILD NEW RUNWAY AT SKY HARBOR

     Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport has selected Greiner
to construct a 7,800-foot-long runway and parallel taxiway system in a
contract that could be worth as much as $2.4 million, pending
negotiations and approval of the Phoenix City Council in January. The
contract also involves four new, high-speed exit taxiways, aircraft
run-up pad, Cat I computer-controlled lighting, glide slope, and MALSR
(medium-intensity approach lighting system with runway alignment
indicator lights). The existing FAA glide slope will be relocated, and
airfield lighting and guidance signs will be installed. Construction
is anticipated to begin in 1997, with a completion date in 1999.

CHARLOTTE-DOUGLAS TDWR UP AND RUNNING EARLIER THAN SCHEDULED

     Spurred by a fatal airplane crash in July 1994, the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration has installed and made fully operational a $5
million terminal Doppler weather radar (TDWR) at Charlotte-Douglas
International Airport, Charlotte, N.C.
     The system was not scheduled to be operational until mid-1996,
but the crash of a USAir Boeing 737, which resulted in 37 deaths,
raised safety concerns. The crash has been attributed to a "massive
microburst" by testifiers at National Transportation Safety Board
meetings.

SCHIPHOL BUYS CTS  SECURITY SYSTEM

     Crown Technical Systems will install the latest version of its
High Tech Checkpoint at Schiphol Airport. Installation should be
completed by the end of February.
     The HTC will centralize Schiphol's security screening by
consolidating gate screening points in the B and C concourses.
     It is designed to improve security, as well as reduce passenger
processing time and manpower costs. HTC can process more than 1,000
passengers per hour per lane, more than double the capacity at
standard checkpoint configurations. 
     Crown also will train airport employees to use the equipment.

BRAZILIAN AIRPORT EMBARKS ON $12 MILLION CARGO EXPANSION PLAN 

     The airport authority responsible for Guarulhos Airport in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, has approved a $12 million cargo expansion plan to
relieve problems that have plagued the facility [WAW, Sept. 26,]. 
     Construction at the airport has already begun, including
expanding import and export facilities, as well as improving the
computer system and security at the airport, says Infraero, the
government-
owned handling company. Brazilian company Camargo Correa/Constram was
awarded the expansion contract, which is to be completed in April. 
     Significant strides have also been taken to improve cargo
handling at the facility, although delays in cargo clearance still
exist. "I couldn't believe I was in the same airport," says Mike
Nenadovich, IATA facilities manager, days after his second visit to
Guarulhos Airport. Nenadovich first visited the airport in April and
wrote a scathing report on numerous problems there. 
     "The place was not busting at the seams," Nenadovich says, but
Infraero has made strides to move and store cargo more efficiently. It
is the customs authority that continues to delay cargo, Nenadovich
says. Infraero now claims that 100% of cargo is checked into a
warehouse within 12 hours of arrival. It is then turned over to
customs.
     The weak link is still MANTRA, Brazilian Customs's computer
system, he says. "You are unable to correct a typo on [airway bills
required by customs]. You must make an appointment and the customs
agent has to go in and fix it. The whole purpose of [electronic data
interchange] is to get it done and to get it done fast. Why have EDI
if you have to make appointments to make changes?" he asks. Customs
officials admitted that some problems exist, Nenadovich says, noting
they would like IATA's help in improving the system. Nenadovich says
he currently is reviewing possible system enhancements. 
     Although airline representatives at Guarulhos tell Nenadovich
they have lost business equaling more than 4,000 pounds of cargo to
other area airports, he contends "the new management of Infraero has
done a marvelous job." Cargo was not out on the ramp, as it was in
April. All cargo is now stored in a highly-secured warehouse and the
airport has installed 60 computerized security cameras to monitor all
activity at the airport. A fence has been constructed around the
airport, restricting all traffic to one entrance and exit and
additional off-airport facilities are being built to accommodate
freight forwarders, he adds.

EDITORIAL: WAITING GAME

As vehicle output builds up in developing countries, it is natural that
the world's component producers should implement a strategy of
international expansion with the aim of establishing a foothold in
regions where the automotive sector is forecast to experience its most
rapid growth during the next 10-15 years.

For many, this implies making the necessary commitment today in
countries as diverse as Brazil, China, India and Mexico - and, of
course, the former members of the Eastern Bloc. A browse through the
News Analysis sections of this and previous issues of Automotive
Components Analyst will reveal a wide range of references to takeovers
and the establishment of joint ventures in these up and coming areas.

The problem, though, is that progress is likely to be far from smooth
and, like all forms of investment, timing is everything. A review of
the automotive sector's recent fortunes indicates that - from a
component supplier's standpoint - currently the Czech Republic and
India are good places to be, but conditions are far less satisfactory
(to put it at its mildest) in Mexico and Turkey. Who will be the
winners and losers in 1996 and in the run-up to 2000, and how long
before a satisfactory payback is received from these new ventures?

Meanwhile, individual component producers still have the potential to
reap significant rationalisation benefits from making appropriate and
opportune acquisitions in the West. The proposed takeover of the
American companies Gates Rubber and Thompson International by the UK-
based groups Tomkins and McKechnie respectively - the former involving
a $1bn deal - together with a recent spate of acquisitions by US
corporations of European component manufacturing operations, are
indicative of a gradual convergence of the two regions' component
manufacturing sectors.

Although there is long term promise in countries with developing motor
industries, there are sound reasons for believing that the majority of
corporate action will be centred in the West during the coming year.
Notwithstanding the cyclical nature of vehicle demand in America and
Europe, these are the places - along with Japan - which generate
today's volumes and profits.

In addition, the major component groups realise that the key to future
success rests on staying at the technological forefront in terms of
both products and manufacturing. From that everything else will follow -
 including low prices and global reach. It could be, therefore, that
the companies to watch are those who are manoeuvring themselves into a
position of commercial and technological pre-eminence in the markets of
today to the exclusion of the markets of tomorrow.

After all, in the interests of international competitiveness, no
vehicle manufacturer will be able to ignore the lowest prices when
these are teamed up with the highest technical content. And the
continuing process of components industry consolidation means that
those who have failed to develop a wider global presence may be able to
acquire it later on.

BOSCH EXPANDS IN CHINA

Robert Bosch has formed a 50/50 joint venture in China with Zhong-Lion
Automotive Electronics Ltd (Shanghai) for the development, production
and marketing of electronic management systems for petrol engines.
These will be manufactured under Bosch licence and sold with the Bosch
brand.

Bosch and Zhong-Lion plan to invest more than DM200m up to 2000, by
which time it is envisaged that the venture will be employing about
2,500 people and producing 1.2m engine management systems a year.

The new company, to be known as United Automotive Electronic Systems Co
Ltd, will have its head office in Shanghai, while its manufacturing
locations will be based at Wuxi (Jiangsu Province) and Xi'an (Shensi
Province).

The Bosch group already has a joint venture in China for the
manufacture of diesel injection systems.

FIRSTEEL GROUP INVESTS IN NEW STEEL SERVICE CENTRE

UK-based Firsteel Strip Mill Products has announced plans to invest #3m
in re-equipping and relocating its Church & Bramhall division with the
aim of enabling it to meet the changing needs of its customers in the
automotive components industry. The operation is a specialist supplier
of high grade, hot rolled strip, and the investment is targeted at
providing the latest technology to process and distribute highly
customised, high quality products in the most cost effective manner.

A new wide slitting line is being installed to improve productivity and
flexibility, as well as provide a 40 per cent capacity increase. The
plant will be capable of handling 25 tonne coils in widths of up to
1850mm with an increased gauge range from 1.5mm up to 8mm. The line
will also incorporate innovations to enable the service centre to
diversify away from traditional products and process a wider range of
ferrous materials, including the new generation of high performance
steels which are being specified increasingly by automotive customers.

The Church & Bramhall development is the second stage in a five year
plan whereby Firsteel Strip Mill Products is changing from being a
stockholder to a specialist service centre business. The strategy is
based on the trend for a growing percentage of steel to be routed
through specialist processors rather than direct from producer to end
user - a development which is more and more evident in the automotive
sector. This provides a solution to the contradictory needs of the bulk
steel producer at one end of the spectrum and those of component
customers for smaller quantities of highly customised, quality assured
material which is delivered just-in-time.

MARLEY OPENS NEW MANUFACTURING FACILITY TO SUPPLY ROVER

Marley Automotive Components has opened officially the first phase of
an #8m manufacturing facility at Redditch in the UK. This is linked
directly into Rover Group's computerised production schedule and is
making fully assembled dashboards for the new Rover 200. It is the
first example in the UK of a fully assembled dashboard being produced
in modular form for direct assembly into the vehicle.

Each dashboard is manufactured within a four hour timeframe, from
receipt of the order by on-line computer to delivery of the finished
part to the designated car as it progresses along the Rover 200
assembly line at the nearby Longbridge plant. This process is designed
to eliminate entirely unnecessary stocks of materials and components in
the supply chain. Marley manages the activities of 23 component
suppliers to ensure that stocks do not build up in the supply chain.

This first phase is now operational and has resulted in around 80 new
jobs, and it is envisaged that there will be 200 employees at the new
operation as further products are introduced progressively during 1996.
The next product to be introduced will be the assembled dashboard and
interior components for the recently launched Rover MGF sports car.

T&N TO MANUFACTURE POWDER METAL COMPONENTS IN INDIA

In partnership with Goetze (India), T&N is establishing a joint venture
at Rajasthan, in India, for the manufacture of powder metal engine and
transmission components. The new company will be known as Brico Goetze
(India). T&N will own 51 per cent of the equity and Goetze (India) - in
which T&N has a 25 per cent shareholding - the remaining 49 per cent.
T&N has a long standing joint venture with Goetze (India) for the
manufacture of piston products.

The new facility will be constructed on a greenfield site in Bhiwadi,
about 100km south west of New Delhi, with production scheduled to begin
during the second half of 1996. In addition to supplying the Indian
automotive sector, it is understood that around 15 per cent of output
will be exported from 1997.

T&N regards the establishment of manufacturing bases in Asia-Pacific as
a key element in its strategy of supplying the worldwide requirements
of customers from local sources.

TAKATA SETS UP IN MEXICO

The Japanese component company Takata has set up a manufacturing
facility in Mexico for the eventual production of complete safety
restraint systems including airbags and seatbelts. Initially the scope
of operations will be limited to performing subcontracting work for the
company's facility in America. However, it is anticipated that complete
seatbelt systems will enter into production later in 1996, to be
followed by airbags perhaps in 1999.

When fully operational, it is probable that 50 per cent of output will
be sold to Mexican vehicle producers and the remainder exported to
South American markets.

CHAMPION MAKES SOUTH AFRICAN PURCHASE

Cooper Industries (the parent company of Champion Spark Plug) has
purchased Trichamp, the South African spark plug and wiper blade
manufacturer. This operation used to be known as Champion South Africa
but was divested in the latter part of the 1980s to become a Champion
licensee and renamed Trichamp. The company will now be controlled by UK-
based Champion Europe as part of its Africa and Middle East operations.

It is estimated that Trichamp accounts for around 50 per cent of the
South African replacement market for spark plugs and about 85 per cent
of the country's replacement market for wiper blades. There are 300
employees and annual turnover amounts to approximately $20m.

In line with the changed political circumstances, there is growing
interest on the part of American and European component producers over
prospects for development in South Africa, but also a recognition that
substantial economic progress will be required before the car market's
potential is fulfilled. It seems logical, therefore, that there should
be a strong emphasis on aftermarket opportunities for the time being.

BUNDY SECURES SIGNIFICANT NEW BUSINESS WITH FORD

Bundy International has entered into a supply agreement to provide
brake, fuel and transmission line systems to Ford's new Crown Victoria,
Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Cars. The agreement, which
covers the production life of the models, commences in 1998 and is
estimated to be valued at around $130m. Bundy is supplying Ford with
brake and fuel systems on Ford's three current equivalent models, but
the new deal includes the supply of transmission oil cooler lines.

Bundy believes that the new business has been won in large measure due
to the improved corrosion resistance of its products, together with its
ability to provide enhanced day-to-day engineering support to Ford.
Bill Laule - Chief Executive of Bundy International - states that
"automotive manufacturers today demand a total systems capability on a
global supply basis. Bundy's capability and extensive product portfolio
helped to secure this important platform agreement. Our detailed
knowledge of the marketplace will enable the company to develop value
added systems for future platform partnerships with all our automotive
customers".

(For an in-depth review of Bundy International's current scope of
operations and strategic thinking, together with its plans for the
future, see the Viewpoint feature in Automotive Components Analyst,
December 1995.)

FFD-RICARDO TO SUPPLY CHRYSLER WITH DRIVELINE ASSEMBLIES

The American operation of FFD-Ricardo (based in Livonia, Michigan) has
won a contract to supply driveline assemblies for Chrysler's Plymouth
Prowler - a roadster which is expected to be produced at the rate of up
to 5,000 annually starting in the 1997 model year. This contract
represents the first major extension of the company's traditional
design engineering role.

FFD-Ricardo is to supply the assembly which connects the Prowler's
engine, driveline and transmission, and includes the casings and
driveshaft attachments for both bell housings. The company will
manufacture, assemble and supply the interfacing units, complete with
internal components and external attachments, direct from its Livonia
facility. Dana Corporation is also involved in the project and will
supply the driveshaft and interfacing rubber couplings.

Chrysler has adapted its existing 4-speed automatic transaxle for the
Prowler's rear mounted position. Previously, the transverse unit had
been specified only for front wheel drive applications. The engineering
challenge has been to develop a new driveline system for transferring
torque from the Prowler's front mounted 3.5-litre engine to its rear
mounted transaxle. The driveline is designed to handle 300 Nm of torque
at 3100 rpm. It is also capable of handling power transmission at
engine speeds in excess of 6400 rpm.

Hollandia Weathershields (the UK automotive sunroof manufacturer which
was formerly known as Britax and is now owned by the Dutch company
Vermeulen Hollandia) has won a contract valued at #200,000 a year from
a major Russian automotive importer. The company enjoys a thriving
export business with sales to around 30 countries, but this is the
first time that an order has been received from Russia.

The sunroofs are destined for sale and fitment in the Russian
aftermarket which, it appears, is becoming increasingly fashion
conscious and providing a growing range of opportunities for Western
companies with "status" products.

Inalfa has won a contract to supply sunroof systems to Rover Group for
the 200 model. They will be produced at the Dutch company's new
facility near Tamworth in the UK which will gradually take over the
responsibility for supplying Inalfa's other British customers.
Production of sunroofs for Jaguar is expected to be transferred to
Tamworth from the Netherlands in mid-1996, followed by sunroofs for the
Range Rover by the end of 1996.

Inalfa states that production of sunroofs at its UK factory will amount
to 200,000 a year, but there is sufficient space to boost this to
600,000 if necessary. The facility will operate initially with 150
employees.

Confirming the widespread belief that the UK is a cost effective
manufacturing location for automotive components, Fred Welschen -
Chairman and Chief Executive of the Inalfa group - indicates that
production costs are 15 per cent lower than in the Netherlands.

BMW'S SECOND GENERATION IMMOBILISER PROVES ITS WORTH

BMW claims that its second generation intelligent electronic
immobiliser provides the optimum solution to "classic" car theft, which
is defined as theft without using the actual key to the car.

Since January 1995, all BMWs - amounted to around 600,000 cars - have
been equipped with the immobiliser as standard. German police report
that, of the 4,600 BMWs reported as stolen in the country during the
ten months to end-October 1995, only 109 were produced in 1995 compared
with 938 thefts of 1994-produced cars during the same period. Moreover,
the thefts of 1995 cars were attributed to fraud or other means such as
hoisting on to a truck, as opposed to being driven off without the use
of the vehicle's key.

BMW's intelligent immobiliser is fully automatic and does not require
any intervention on the part of the driver. It is based on the
transponder principle with a coil shaped antenna around the ignition
lock and a microchip in the key handle. As the key is turned in the
lock, the antenna takes on the role of a transformer and induces a
certain voltage in the microchip. In turn, the microchip is activated
and verifies the code sequences. Once the key has been identified, a
digitally coded signal is transmitted to the engine management system
which allows the engine to start.

Each key is unique and is programmed and coded at the factory. The
transponder memory of each key therefore has a permanent personal code
as well as a constantly changing random code with 100bn variants.

HELLA DEVELOPS NEW AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM

Hella has developed a new air conditioning system which offers the
opportunity for the driver and front seat passenger to select different
temperatures. These temperatures, moreover, can be maintained under all
circumstances, including intense sunlight. Hella devised the new system
following research into interior car conditions which indicated that
the ideal temperature for the driver and passenger was usually
different. The driver, being "active" prefers cooler conditions while
the resting passenger requires a warmer atmosphere.

The advanced air conditioning unit operates by means of a "loop" based
system, comprising a main control loop which adjusts four main
temperatures, and secondary loops which provide the variations for the
left and right hand sides of the vehicle. Two photodiode sensors
measure intensity and direction of sunlight, and adjust very quickly
the inside temperatures as appropriate.

The complexity of the system implies the potential for a significant
margin of error in manufacturing, with the result that Hella has
established stringent quality control standards. The company claims
that there is likely to be only one defect in 14,000 units at the end
of the vehicle assembly line. Current production amounts to 2,000 units
a month.

The first application is on the Audi A8. Steve Widdett - OE Sales
Manager at Hella Manufacturing - states that "in a comparison test, the
A8 Hella air conditioning unit was judged the best by far. We would
hope to see other manufacturers following suit, and installing this
precision system into their luxury models".

RADIATOR DURABILITY IMPROVED BY ELECTROPHORETIC COATING

With car and truck radiators under attack from a variety of sources -
including acid rain, road salts and atmospheric pollution -
manufacturers have been examining ways of lessening the impact.
Electrophoretic coating (E-coating), a traditional protector of
automotive components, is viewed increasingly as the technology which
can make a major improvement.

Tests have been carried out on many conventional copper-brass radiators
and E-coating has demonstrated encouraging credentials with regard to
corrosion protection.

With the introduction of no-flux brazed copper-brass radiators, the
value of the process could be highly significant. These radiators
incorporate technology developed by the International Copper
Association. Made with thin gauge fins and tubes, they are up to 40 per
cent lighter than traditional copper-brass radiators. If conventionally
spray painted, radiators as thin and as light as this could be
especially vulnerable to corrosion. Indeed, laboratory tests have
always shown that conventional spray painting reduces corrosion
resistance in radiators.

But in tests conducted by Outokumpu Copper of Sweden with E-coating
systems from ICI Electrocoat and PPG Industries, it is reported that
the corrosion resistance of E-coated copper-brass radiators was
exceptional on all counts, even within seams and along sharp edges.

ROCKWELL'S TWIN SPOILER SUNROOF FITTED TO MERCEDES-BENZ CONCEPT VEHICLE

The Mercedes-Benz AA Vision - the design concept of the All-Activity
Vehicle (AAV) which was introduced at the recent North American
International Auto Show in Detroit - is equipped with a twin spoiler
sunroof supplied by Rockwell Automotive. The AA Vision incorporates
many of the design features which have been specified for Mercedes-
Benz's upcoming AAV which is scheduled to be produced at the company's
American assembly facility in Alabama, starting in 1997. Rockwell has
been chosen to supply an electric slide-tilt sunroof for this model.

The twin spoiler sunroof contains a front and rear panel, both of which
tilt for ventilation, as well as sliding open. James Hardy - General
Manager of Rockwell Automotive's Roof Systems, Americas - reports that
the company's American and German development facilities worked closely
with Mercedes-Benz's Advanced Design Group in California in developing
the product.

Rockwell holds a significant position in the sunroof sector and has
established a global network of manufacturing operations. Based in
Germany at Frankfurt, there are additional facilities at Gifhorn (also
in Germany), Birmingham (UK), Brighton, Michigan (America), Queretaro
(Mexico) and Hiroshima (Japan).

REPLACEMENT CATALYTIC CONVERTER DEMAND SET TO RISE IN EUROPE

The market for replacement catalytic converters is expected to rise
progressively in Europe, in line with their now universal fitment on
new petrol-engined cars and the likelihood of an increasing detection
of failure during vehicle testing. For example, as from January 1,
1996, three year old catalyst-equipped cars will be subject to the UK's
MoT vehicle test.

To meet this expected demand, Timax Exhaust Systems is introducing a
range of replacement catalytic converters in the UK. Timax is a member
of TESH which already supplies a range of catalytic converters to the
German and other markets, where cat-equipped cars were introduced
during the latter part of the 1980s.

The Timax range in the UK is being produced with metallic monoliths and
shells which are being sourced from Rosi in France and are being
assembled in recently extended facilities at the company's
manufacturing operation at Blackpool. This new facility is utilising
small batch cellular manufacturing techniques in order to provide a
fast response to customer demands in a market whose size is difficult
to predict at present.

For background information, TESH was established in 1993 and is the
European joint venture company of the North American group Arvin
Industries Inc and the Italian group Sogefi SpA. It incorporates their
replacement exhaust manufacturing companies Ansa Marmitte of Italy
(Sogefi), Rosi of France (Sogefi) and Timax UK (Arvin). The combined
market penetration of all three companies makes TESH the second largest
replacement exhaust supplier in Europe with a market share estimated to
be in excess of 20 per cent.

FILTRAUTO INTRODUCES AUTOMATIC POWDER-COAT FACILITIES

The Filtrauto Group has introduced fully automatic, powder-coat
painting lines at two of its European operations - at the Purflux
factory at Vire in France and at the Crosland Filters plant at
Kingswinford in the UK. Each is capable of painting 3,500 filter
canisters per hour.

The new lines, which replace the traditional methods of manual
handling, use a solvent-free, powder-coat paint and incorporate a
network of sensors to integrate all elements of the painting process.
Canisters are automatically loaded into the pre-treatment section where
their surfaces are degreased and prepared with phosphates to accept the
paint. In stage two, they are oven dried and transferred mechanically
to the paint conveyor where the powder spray booths are mounted. These
booths are designed to maximise energy efficiency, and any excess
powder sprayed is reclaimed and re-used. The canisters are then
transferred automatically to the oven, which is the final section of
the line.

Crosland reports that the new process paints a cannister in little over
five minutes from start to finish.

PILKINGTON ANNOUNCES NEW PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF MIRRORS

Pilkington has announced a "revolutionary advance" in the manufacture
of mirrors. The new product range - to be known as Pilkington Reflex -
is manufactured by a process which dispenses with conventional off-line
silvering techniques and enables a reflective surface to be applied as
the glass itself is being manufactured on the float line.

Pilkington Reflex gains its reflectivity from a multi-layer sandwich of
ultra-thin silicon and silica coatings, as opposed to the conventional
reflective metallic film. The coatings are applied by means of a
process known as chemical vapour deposition, which is carried out
continuously on the float glass as it moves at a speed of a few hundred
metres per hour. Several layers are formed, with each layer having a
thickness accuracy of just a few atoms.

The new technology will enable Pilkington to supply mirror products
which are toughened, bent or laminated - in similar manner to uncoated
float glass - and there will be far less susceptibility to damage
during the manufacturing process.

It is expected that the application of Pilkington Reflex will be
especially appropriate where mirrors are required to withstand harsh
and humid conditions, and will therefore be particularly applicable for
the automotive industry. As a consequence of the materials used,
mirrors produced with the new technique will not deteriorate at the
edges, as occurs with conventionally silvered mirrors.

There are environmental benefits too during manufacturing, since the
use of chemicals is reduced and no precious metals or lead-based
backing paints are needed.

At the announcement in mid-January, Glen Nightingale - Director of
Pilkington, technology and manufacturing - stated that Pilkington
Reflex "revolutionises the way mirrors are made (and) will find use in
all segments of the substantial mirror market".

For the record, it is estimated that the worldwide market for glass
mirrors amounts to 110m sq m a year, which makes the sector the third
largest end-use of flat and safety glass after construction and
automotive. The automotive mirror market is significant in terms of
volume and value, but relatively small with regard to total area used.

DELPHI'S EUROPEAN SITES CERTIFIED TO ISO9000 BY TARGET DATE OF END 1995

Apart from the 10 per cent of sites which are too new to have completed
the certification process, all of Delphi Automotive Systems' European
facilities were certified to ISO9000 by the end of 1995, in line with a
target set in 1993.

The remainder are working towards the standard, but it takes up to 18
months to complete the certification process. Recent expansion has
resulted in the establishment of new factories in France, Germany,
Italy and the UK, together with new customer service centres in
Germany, Italy, Poland and the UK. At present, the company has 50
manufacturing plants, 13 customer service centres and three technical
centres in the region.

Delphi reports that its commitment to ISO9000 has resulted in many more
benefits than initially anticipated. For example, in addition to
meeting a minimum quality system, implementing the standard has helped
Delphi to increase its quality focus and foster closer relationships
with its customers. Moreover, the adoption of an internationally
recognised quality standard has facilitated faster and more effective
integration with customers' quality systems and has saved time and
money during quality audits.

The standardised framework is also helping to harmonise quality systems
within Delphi and to improve communications between sites and
disciplines.

Delphi's next objective is to develop standard quality policy manuals
for each of the three types of operation - manufacturing site, customer
service centre and technical centre. It is anticipated that this will
provide further enhancement to consistency throughout the company and
provide a basis from which new operations can be verified very quickly.

WORLDWIDE VEHICLE PRODUCERS LOOKING FOR SAVINGS IN UPCOMING MODELS

Vehicle producers are aiming to reduce unit costs by up to 30 per cent
for their next generation of models and are expecting component
suppliers to make a major contribution.

This was the blunt message that came across during the purchasing
seminar at the recent World Congress in Detroit, organised by
"Automotive News".

An area of major concern for car manufacturers is growing consumer
resistance to high list (sticker) prices and the likelihood that the
additional costs of safety and environmental equipment - much of which
is demanded by legislation - will increasingly have to be absorbed by
the manufacturers themselves rather than passed on to consumers. This
is leading to the concept of "target pricing" whereby the marketing
department determines what consumers want and how much they are
prepared to pay, leaving the design, development and manufacturing
departments with the task of meeting the cost objectives.

Tyre Corporation - is re-establishing its position in the marketplace.

Financial results for 1995 are likely to show further significant
losses, but the 1995-97 $100m investment programme is to be maintained
with the objective of improving productivity at its factories and
increasing capacity.

DAEWOO PLANS SUBSTANTIAL POLISH EXPANSION

Following an agreement to link up with the Polish producer FSO, Daewoo
is expected to oversee an expansion in output from the present level of
around 100,000 vehicles a year to 220,000 by 2001. Daewoo is to acquire
an initial 10 per cent equity holding in FSO, but is expected
eventually to move to majority ownership with a 70 per cent stake.

In addition to built-up vehicles, Daewoo has indicated that it intends
to produce engines and transmissions at FSO.

Meanwhile, development of the existing model range is taking place.
Every FSO model is likely to be equipped with a new ZF power steering
system and advanced Lucas braking system, while interiors are being
revised substantially.

IVECO'S UKRANIAN VENTURE TO BUILD UP LOCAL CONTENT TO 70 PER CENT

A three-way agreement has been signed between Kraz (Ukraine's sole
commercial vehicle producer), Bers (the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development) and Iveco for the manufacture and
marketing of the Daily and EuroCargo range of trucks in the Ukraine.
Iveco and Kraz will own 35 per cent each and Bers 30 per cent.

Initial output will be based on imports of CKD kits, but the intention
is to build up local content progressively to the 70 per cent level by
the end of 2000, by which time annual production is expected to reach
12,000 units.

NISSAN TO MAKE TRANSAXLES IN AMERICA...

Nissan is to establish a manufacturing facility in Tennessee for the
manufacture of transaxles. Output is expected to begin during the first
half of 1997 and build up to an annual rate of around 300,000 units.
Among the models to be equipped with the transaxle is the Altima.

The transaxle facility is likely to be located at Decherd where the
company is already constructing a plant to build engines for the
Altima. It is also possible that Decherd could develop into a
significant components manufacturing centre for Nissan's American
assembly operations.

NISSAN INITIATES PROJECT TO RAISE STANDARDS OF UK SUPPLIERS

Together with Cranfield University, Nissan has initiated a three-year
project with the aim of assisting its UK component suppliers to improve
their design and development capabilities. This is now regarded as a
more critical area than quality and productivity, where UK companies
have achieved substantial gains in recent years.

It is estimated that Nissan's assembly operation at Sunderland
purchases components to the value of #550m a year from UK suppliers.

PORSCHE PLANS INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION

Further evidence of the pressure facing German vehicle producers in the
context of high domestic manufacturing costs and the strong DM has been
provided by Porsche following the announcement that its next new model
(after the Boxster which is scheduled to make its market debut during
the second half of 1996) will be produced outside Germany.

The company has been conducting a number of feasibility studies into
new models and is looking to form joint ventures in order to develop
and bring into production its next generation of performance cars. The
nature and form of any joint venture is likely to have a significant
impact on determining component procurement policies, especially since
a key part of any future co-operation will almost certainly include the
search for lower prices.

DISAPPOINTING RESULTS FROM SWEDISH CAR PRODUCERS

The latest disappointing financial results from Saab and Volvo have
been blamed in part to an over-dependence on German component sources
at a time when the DM has remained strong against the SKr.
Unfortunately, this high level of component purchases has not been
offset by a corresponding elevated level of car sales by Saab and Volvo
in the German market. Instead, export success has come mainly from
countries such as America and the UK whose currencies have been weak
against the SKr.

Under these circumstances, the purchasing departments of both companies
will be looking more favourably towards stepping up purchases from
British and other cost effective supply sources, with the aim of
establishing a better balance between their component sourcing and
principal car markets.

TOYOTA ANTICIPATES HIGHER OUTPUT IN 1996

According to the company's forecasts, component suppliers to Toyota can
expect an increase in volumes during 1996. Toyota's vehicle output in
Japan is expected to rise by 6 per cent to 3.35m units and overseas
production by 9 per cent to 1.37m units.

Car production at Toyota's UK assembly facility is forecast to rise by
20 per cent to 110,000 units.

TOYOTA PLANS FURTHER EXPANSION IN AMERICA

Toyota is to set up an engine manufacturing operation in America to
supply its Canadian assembly facility where the Corolla is produced.
Annual output of the model in Canada is expected to rise to the 200,000
level.

In addition, the company is looking for another American location for
the manufacture of stamped parts.

Both moves correspond to the greater pressure on Japanese vehicle
manufacturers generally to boost their sourcing of components and
subassemblies from North America, largely for political reasons.

PRODUCTION: COMMERCIAL VEHICLES

- American truck production in 1995 amounted to 5.58m units, a decline
of 2 per cent over the 1994 level.

- During the same period Canadian truck output was 5 per cent lower at
1,036,000 units.

- 1995 has been a year of strong recovery for the European commercial
vehicle sector. All of the principal producing countries have secured
impressive gains. Italian commercial vehicle production amounted to
209,000 units during the first ten months of the year - an increase of
32 per cent over the corresponding period of 1994. Sweden followed
closely with a 30 per cent gain to 75,000 units after nine months.

- The Spanish industry has performed strongly too, with a 22 per cent
increase to 279,000 in the January-September period.

- During the period January to November, the French commercial vehicle
sector produced 394,000 units - for a rise of 13 per cent. Meanwhile,
German output during the first 11 months advanced by 18 per cent to
282,000 units, while UK production in the same period expanded by 4 per
cent to 220,000.

SALES: CARS

- American car demand in 1995 fell by 4 per cent to 8.64m units.
Canadian sales in 1995 experienced a rather more serious fall of 10 per
cent to 673,000.

- As noted in the previous issue, hopes for a strong rise in European
car demand during 1995 have not been fulfilled. An impressive
performance is evident in Sweden where car demand increased by 8 per
cent to 169,000 in 1995 as a whole.

- There were also increases - albeit more modest ones - in Germany (4
per cent higher at 3.08m after 11 months), the UK (2 per cent higher at
1.95m for the year as a whole) and Italy (2 per cent higher at 1.71m,
also for the complete year).

- However, car sales in France were 1 per cent lower after 11 months at
1.79m, and Spanish car demand was 3 per cent lower at 526,000 after
seven months (the latest figure available).

- In Japan, car demand during the first ten months of 1995 was 5 per
cent higher at 3.73m.

period of 1994 at 6m, while Canadian truck sales (again, all weight
categories) during 1995 as a whole were 4 per cent lower at 465,000.

- The European commercial vehicle market has performed well in 1995. As
with cars, Sweden has achieved the strongest rise with a 43 per cent
advance to 15,000 to the end of December. During the same period, UK
commercial vehicle sales were 10 per cent higher at 250,000.

- In the period to end-November, French commercial vehicle demand
increased by 12 per cent to 331,000 units, while Italian sales were 25
per cent higher at 133,000 and German sales 2 per cent higher at
238,000.

JAPANESE SOURCING

No-one seriously believes that Japanese vehicle producers are about to
implement radical changes to their component sourcing policies. Even
so, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the traditional rigid
pattern is breaking down at the edges, with the result that "outsiders"
should not give up their attempts to break into the market.

One of the most significant developments recently has been Nissan's
decision to award a supply contract to Aisin Seiki, a member of
Toyota's family of component companies. This has been based apparently
on quality and cost considerations, and is a natural consequence of the
need to seek out all possible means of maintaining a grip in an
international marketplace where competition is intensifying
remorselessly.

The Japanese are facing a combination of factors which means that past
relationships will count for little if higher cost savings are to be
found elsewhere. Leaving aside political and currency factors (which
alone are sufficient to jettison old habits) Japanese vehicle producers
face the twin squeeze of resurging American and European automotive
sectors - which are not only producing a new generation of freshly
styled models to a high quality, but also implementing massive cost
cutting programmes - and developing industries in low cost areas,
chiefly in neighbouring Far Eastern countries.

European component groups inclined to try their luck with Japanese
vehicle producers should go to the JAMA-CLEPA conference (see page 11)
and listen as well as talk.

PRICES - AGAIN

The purchasing seminar at the recent World Congress in Detroit,
organised by "Automotive News", provided fresh evidence that component
producers - wherever they are based - will face unprecedented pressures
on their margins over the next few years. It used to be only the
Japanese who set "impossible" targets for their suppliers, but now
everyone is in on the act. BMW, for example, is looking for cost cuts
of 25-30 per cent for the next 3-series, while Chrysler does not intend
to sanction any price increases for components during 1996 and is
looking for savings of $1bn in the medium term.

Despite the well publicised rough ride received by Ford at its round of
supplier meetings during 1995, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that
vehicle manufacturers are well placed to have their demands satisfied.
The establishment of global supplier bases means that companies such as
Ford and General Motors are devising the means to identify and source
from companies which have the lowest cost structures and/or willingness
to shave margins to the minimum.

Moreover, this ability is spreading throughout the industry as
globalisation proceeds apace. Take BMW, for example, which until
recently could be classified as a fairly parochial German player with
regard to manufacturing and sourcing. Now it owns Rover Group in the UK
and has a developing commitment to manufacturing in America, both of
which will facilitate the potential to break free from the
straightjacket of German component sourcing.

SPEED SENSE

The control of vehicle speed is an emotive issue for most motorists.
Increasingly, though, the effective regulation of speeds is seen as a
tool for making better use of the road system, reducing accident rates
and limiting the environmental impacts of car use.

After a hard-fought battle between the pro and anti lobbies, President
Clinton signed the bill that ended the 55 mph (88 km/h) national speed
limit in the US. Individual states are now free to set their own limits
or, indeed, to have none. The national limits, thoroughly unpopular in
western and southern states, were set by Congress in 1973 as an energy
conservation and safety measure. The most worrying facet of the
abolition of the national speed limits was that the environmental
implications of speed merited barely a sentence in the congressional
and public debates on the issue. The discussion focused almost
exclusively on safety concerns.

Speed is an important factor in determining the emissions from a car.
Essentially, a vehicle is at its least polluting (per mile travelled)
when it is travelling at a constant speed of around 45 mph (72 km/h).
As the speed moves away from this value and/or the journey becomes
stop/start in nature, emissions tend to increase. Specifically, as
speeds rise above 55 mph, the environmental implications are
significant:

* a vehicle travelling at 65 mph (105 km/h) emits 100% more carbon
monoxide than the same vehicle travelling at 55mph, as well as 50% more
hydrocarbons and 31% more nitrogen oxides;

* passenger cars and light trucks use about 50% more fuel travelling at
75 mph (121 km/h) than they do at 55 mph. This translates directly into
increased CO2 emissions.

Despite the clear implications of increased speeds for emissions of CO2
and toxic pollutants, the protagonists in the US debate talked only of
safety and their concerns over security of oil supply. This narrow
vision seems all the stranger for a nation that has a history of
adopting the most stringent vehicle emissions legislation in the world.
Moreover, the debates came as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change were re-confirming their belief that global climate change is
happening and that action is required to reduce CO2 emissions.

Of course, no one is pretending that the 55 mph speed limit was being
obeyed police tended not to stop drivers doing 10 mph greater than the
speed limit anyway and the law was often described as the most flouted
in America. In general, research shows that without stringent
enforcement, drivers travel at whatever speed they feel comfortable
with, regardless of official speed limits. In this sense, bad speed
limits can be defined as those that are poorly enforced.

The abolition of the national speed limit in the US comes at an
interesting time for speed discussions. Throughout Europe, attitudes to
speed limits and controls are changing. In the UK, the M25 has recently
become the subject of a controlled motorway trial with variable speed
limits employed in an attempt to make better use of the road space.
Message signs are used to show a mandatory speed limit depending on
traffic levels measured by underground sensors. The preliminary results
show smoother traffic flows and reduced delays with a consequent
reduction in fuel use and emissions.

At a European level, legislation was introduced recently to fit speed-
governors that physically limit the speed of coaches and heavy trucks.
Even in Germany, the no limit rule on the Autobahns was recently
reviewed as the country was hit by episodes of high pollution. Indeed,
the absence of a German speed limit is currently the subject of a legal
challenge from an environmental transport group.

By combining the intelligent use of speed limits with developments in
areas such as obstacle sensors and route guidance, the future holds
genuine gains in terms of improving the efficiency with which the road
networks can be used. As the American experience shows, any speed
regulation must be accompanied by effective enforcement technological
developments such as speed cameras and radar systems provide the means
for such a system to exist. Providing speed regulation does not end up
merely stimulating more traffic, thereby recreating the original
congestion, there are clear environmental and operational benefits
available.

Whatever individual states decide to do with their new-found speed
limit powers, the quality of debate exhibited in the USA seems to
indicate that Europe is genuinely a step ahead in terms of
understanding the environmental benefits available from sensible speed-
control measures.

BRAZIL RETAINS FUEL-ALCOHOL PROGRAMME

Brazil continues to pursue its controversial policy of supporting the
use of alcohol as a fuel for road vehicles. An executive committee has
decided to retain the programme of subsidies for fuel alcohol produced
from Brazilian sugar cane. The market for alcohol is also guaranteed by
the committee's decision to maintain the 22% minimum alcohol content in
petrol.

Further, the committee has entered into talks with sugar cane growers
and distillers to look for methods of promoting the creation of a green
fleet in Brazil. The resulting scheme is likely to provide subsidies to
encourage buses, taxis and other urban public vehicles to switch to
fuel with a higher alcohol content.

NATURAL GAS HEAVY-DUTY ENGINE MEETS ULEV STANDARDS

Thermo Power Corporation has succeeded in producing a natural gas heavy-
duty engine capable of meeting the USA's Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle
(ULEV) standards. The ULEV standard is the next most stringent standard
after the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) category, and Thermo Power's
engine is the first natural gas engine to be granted ULEV status. The
engine's success further extends the potential market for NG heavy duty
vehicles into those areas where the most stringent exhaust standards
are in operation.

Thermo Power's Tecodrive engine is based on a 4.3 litre General Motors
Corporation petrol engine block. Thermo Power modified the original
engine for optimal operation on natural gas by using an advanced
natural gas fuel-injection system and closed-loop electronic controls.
The result is an engine that provides performance similar to a petrol
version, while producing much lower emissions the engine easily meets
the ULEV standard, producing just 6% of the permitted amount of non-
methane hydrocarbon emissions, 16% of the carbon monoxide limit and 45%
of the nitrogen oxides standard.

The engine's development was partly supported by the US Department of
Energy, and its first commercial use will be in 276 vehicles for UPS.

FUEL CELL VEHICLE HITS THE MARKET

The first vehicle powered by a fuel cell has entered the market place
in the US. Fuel cells are mini power-plants that produce power by
combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water without
combustion and, perhaps more importantly, without pollution. Fuel cells
have long been seen as the ultimate clean, alternative power source for
vehicles. However, their rapid development in recent years has meant
that they are now being taken seriously.

The Genesis ZEV's specification and performance mean that manufacturers
of conventional vehicles can, for now, rest easily. The Genesis uses a
7.5kW fuel cell, runs for three hours on a full tank of hydrogen, has a
range of around 45 miles and a reckless top speed of 15 mph. Fuel tanks
hold compressed oxygen and hydrogen and these can be refilled in 15
minutes. The vehicle is intended for use in operations such as airport
cargo hauling, grounds maintenance, or as a people mover in amusement
parks.

The vehicle and associated fuelling stations were developed in a
collaborative effort by Energy Partners Inc., Western Golf Car and
Telesis Cogeneration. The Big Three vehicle manufacturers in the US all
have fuel cell development programmes in conjunction with the US
Department of Energy. A variety of independent programmes is also under
way throughout Europe and North America. Most recently, Chicago Transit
Authority started a two year trial operating three buses powered by
Ballard fuel cell engines. The power density of fuel cells is being
constantly improved, and their use in vehicles will become more
widespread as more progress is achieved.

NATURAL GAS VEHICLE WINS AWARD

A natural gas vehicle design has been recognised by Popular Science
magazine as one 1995's 100 greatest achievements in science and
technology. The Advanced Natural Gas Vehicle (ANGV) was designed and
developed by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore. The ANGV is based on a modified subcompact car a
Geo Prism and has a driving range of 300 miles with performance
comparable to the original petrol version.

GAS BUSES FOR SOUTHAMPTON

Southampton Citybus and British Gas have signed a ten-year agreement as
part of a scheme to introduce natural gas buses to Southampton. British
Gas will build, equip and operate a gas filling station in the company
s bus depot. Hampshire County Council and the UK Department of
Transport are supporting an initiative to convert six buses to gas,
with a further 10 provided through other government funding.

The agreement was announced before the much anticipated tax break for
natural gas was disclosed in the UK budget. The financial advantages
brought by the reduced fuel duty can be expected to boost the number of
UK schemes for natural gas vehicles in the coming months.

JAPAN HELPS THAILAND WITH FUEL TESTING AND SPECIFICATION

Japan has announced a four year project with Thailand as part of its
continuing policy of technical support to South-east Asian countries
suffering air pollution problems. Beginning in March 1996, the
Petroleum Energy Centre (PEC) of Japan will transfer technologies to
its Thai counterpart, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand. The transfer
will enable the Thai organisation to carry out its own analysis in the
search for cleaner fuels and oils.

The project will involve Japan supplying both expertise and equipment
so that fuels and lubricant specifications can be defined that are most
suitable for the prevailing conditions in Thailand.

MOBIL LAUNCHES CLEANER DIESEL

Mobil has launched a new diesel fuel, Cleanerburn Diesel Plus, which it
claims produces 30% less particulate emissions and 80% less black smoke
emissions than ordinary diesel fuel. Hopes of reduced duty for this
type of cleaner burning diesel were not realised in the UK Budget (NEWS
ANALYSIS, December) and the extra refining processes involved mean that
such fuels are more expensive to manufacture than standard fuels. As a
result, without subsidy, their use in the UK is likely to remain
limited.

GENERAL MOTORS PUNISHED FOR POLLUTING CADILLACS

General Motors (GM) faces a bill of around $45m as punishment for
fitting inadequate pollution control devices to nearly 500,000
Cadillacs. Although GM agreed to the settlement, it continues to
dispute the allegations made by the US EPA that form its basis.

The punishment was agreed with the US Department of Justice, on behalf
of the EPA, for installing illegal devices in Cadillacs that defeat
pollution controls. The guilty device is an engine control system
designed to remedy stalling problems that had occurred when drivers of
the 4.9 litre, V8 engine Cadillacs turned on their climate control
systems. The device works by increasing the fuel to air ratio when the
air conditioning system is in use.

Problems arise because the engine control system overrides the emission
control system, resulting in emissions of carbon monoxide that are
three times the legal limit. GM failed to disclose the use of the
device or its adverse effect on pollution control. However, the EPA
discovered the problem in 1993 during routine emissions testing and
subsequently charged GM with violations of the Clean Air Act. The EPA
estimates that the use of the device has resulted in the additional
release of approximately 100,000 tonnes of carbon monoxide.

The agreement makes three demands of GM:

* a civil fine of $11 million;

* the 470,000 Cadillacs sold since 1991 must be recalled and repaired:
the repair involves fitting a new engine control system to each vehicle
and the whole exercise will cost around $25 million; and

* $8.75m to establish an emission remedial project fund to finance
schemes to reduce air pollution. The fund will be used to repair the
damage done by the Cadillacs and is likely to be used for schemes to
accelerate the scrapping of old, polluting cars and buses.

The punishment forms a landmark in that it involves the first judicial
vehicle recall on environmental grounds, and the fine of $11m ranks as
the second largest meted out under the Clean Air Act.

The settlement has left General Motors feeling rather embittered with
the EPA and the Justice Department. GM issued a statement in which it
made clear that the company strongly disagreed with the allegations
made and considered the issue to be a matter of interpretation of
current regulations . The company stressed that it had agreed with the
settlement as an appropriate resolution of the issue, in line with its
environmental commitment.

PARTICULATE REDUCTION SYSTEMS ON TRIAL IN LONDON BUSES

Rival systems for reducing emissions of harmful particulates are
undergoing trials with two bus firms in London.

EZ Traps have been fitted to four buses operated by Leaside buses. The
system is manufactured by Lubrizol and involves the addition of a
liquid catalyst to the diesel fuel. Results so far are very promising,
showing a reduction in particulate emissions of between 69% and 98%.

Continuously regenerating traps have been developed by Johnson Matthey
and Eminox and are currently being tested by Stagecoach in east London.
No results from this trial are currently available.

Vehicles such as buses and trucks have extended lifetimes and retro-
fitting of particulate reduction systems may be required if urban air
quality standards for this pollutant are to be met.

MEXICO CITY TIGHTENS CAR CONTROLS

As anticipated in last month's NEWS ANALYSIS, Mexico City's authorities
have introduced further measures to tackle the city's dramatic
pollution problems. Phase one of the ambitiously titled Plan to Solve
Atmospheric Problems was introduced in December 1995 and includes an
extension of the ban on each car's use during winter smog episodes from
one day a week to two. It has been estimated that this measure will
result in around 20% less traffic. Phase one also involves cutting
industrial emissions by up to 40% during smog emergencies. Despite
this, critics have argued that the plan imposes the heaviest burden on
motorists while not doing enough to reduce factory emissions.

In 1992, a government study concluded that 76% of air pollution was due
to vehicles. More recently, a study by the University of California-
Irvine concluded that the majority of smog came from cooking fuel.
Whatever the source of the emissions, the authorities have been forced
into action by recent episodes of poor air quality. In the week prior
to the announcement of the new measures, air pollution was grave enough
to cause breathing problems for around 400,000 of the city's 20 million
inhabitants. With ozone levels reaching twice the acceptable limits,
factories were asked to reduce production and outdoor school activities
were prohibited.

CHINA'S POLLUTION PROBLEMS WORSEN

China is experiencing an increasingly serious rise in motor vehicle
emissions that has led to Beijing's vehicle pollution problems
surpassing those of Los Angeles and Tokyo. That is the finding of a
recent study, Automobile Emissions Control Equipment, commissioned by
the US and Foreign Commercial Service.

One of the main problems cited was poor manufacturing techniques that
have contributed to making emission levels from Chinese-made
automobiles dozens of times higher than those in the developed
countries . Most of the 10 million vehicles produced in China every
year have no emissions control equipment and only in recent months have
the Chinese authorities started to examine the issue of vehicle
emissions. The problem requires urgent attention as the number of
privately registered cars is forecast to rise to 18 million by 2000
with rapid growth to 44 million by 2010.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY

The last month has been dominated by discussion of the reconsideration
of California's 1998 ZEV mandate (December's NEWS ANALYSIS). Changes to
the California Air Resources Board (CARB) mandate are still under
consideration and fresh rumours circulate almost daily. The most likely
alterations to the scheme incorporate the following:

* large demonstration fleets of electric vehicles may be required for
the years 1998 to 2000. The numbers under consideration are 750
electric vehicles for 1998, with 1,500 in the two subsequent years.
After the year 2000, CARB are likely to insist on retaining the ZEV
sales targets for 2001 (5% of sales) and 2003 (10%).

* the development and use of advanced batteries would be encouraged by
awarding EVs using such batteries multiple sales credits. For instance,
the sale of an EV using an advanced nickel-metal hydride battery might
merit three credits while a vehicle with a conventional lead-acid
battery would only rate a single credit. In this way, a vehicle
producer could amass sufficient EV credits to meet any mandate by
selling a smaller number of vehicles fitted with advanced batteries.

* CARB is likely to insist on maintaining the established goals for
cutting pollution. For instance, the equivalent air pollution goals to
a 2% ZEV mandate could be met by producing cleaner burning petrol cars
or vehicles using alternative fuels such as natural gas.

The ongoing review and possible changes to California's 1998 mandate
have left the plans of New York, Massachusetts and Vermont a little
exposed. These states opted into the ZEV mandate scheme under the
Northeast Ozone Transport Region's plans. It remains unclear whether
these states can maintain their plans for ZEV sales in 1998 without the
momentum provided by California.

Aside from the negotiations and political manoeuvrings, a new study has
cast doubt upon manufacturers high price projections for EVs. Pricing
for Success: Using Auto Industry Models to Review Electric Vehicle
Costing and Pricing was compiled by Green Car Media, an independent
research organisation. The study claims that the price estimates for
electric vehicles are arbitrarily high and do not reflect typical
policy as they involve the absorption of all development costs into the
vehicle price. The study concludes that the current high price
estimates have resulted in false and disappointing market projections
for electric vehicles.

SOLECTRIA SUNRISE CONTINUES TO IMPRESS

The Solectria Sunrise, the world's first all-composite electric vehicle
designed for mass production, has passed the necessary safety tests and
will begin production in 1998.

The Sunrise employs the AC induction drive system currently used in
Solectria's production electric vehicles, the Force sedan and E-10
pickup truck. The new model makes use of proven components alongside
high energy-density Ovonic nickel- metal hydride batteries and uses
lightweight composite materials throughout. The resulting vehicle is a
full-size, four-passenger sedan, shown to be capable of 238 miles on a
single charge in the 1995 American Tour de Sol electric vehicle road
rally. Further refinement to the design has been made possible by
additional funding received from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology.

Twenty commuters are currently leasing Solectria Force sedans in
Massachusetts and rate their overall satisfaction at 8 out of a maximum
10 points. Solectria claim that these results demonstrate that today's
technology already satisfies the performance and range requirements of
the average urban commuter. They hope to further consolidate this claim
when production of the Sunrise begins.

EV TRIALS IN WESTMINSTER

An #800,000 project in the London Borough of Westminster is set to
introduce up to 25 ZEVs to the city. The scheme is intended to promote
interest in electric vehicles amongst fleet and taxi operators.

A network of recharging stations will be installed at council and
public sites and will be available for use by any suitable electric
vehicle. The council will purchase two cars and two vans for its own
use and will also operate a fleet of five electric taxis from mainline
railway stations. Local fleet operators will be encouraged to purchase
the remaining 16 vehicles available.

The scheme is backed by electricity generator PowerGen, the Department
of Trade and Industry and manufacturers Carbodies and Wavedriver. If
the trials are successful, it is hoped that the 18 month project can be
extended to include neighbouring boroughs and other private operators.

ALUMINIUM USE ON THE INCREASE

Aluminium continues to grow in importance as a material for use in cars
and trucks. In 1994, vehicles became the largest market for the metal
in North America. The annual amount employed has almost doubled during
the last ten years and overall use rose by 15% from 1993 to 1994. All
evidence points to continuing increases in its use as the metal becomes
more important in manufacturers efforts to produce lower-weight
vehicles.

IMCO EXPANDS ALUMINIUM CAPABILITIES

A new aluminium recycling plant is to be built in the USA in a joint
venture by IMCO Recycling Inc. and Alchem Aluminium.

The plant is expected to begin production by the end of 1996 and will
be used to supply recycled metal in molten form, around half of which
will be used by Alchem to produce specification aluminium alloys that
are sold principally to automobile companies and manufacturers of
vehicle components. Michigan, Ohio and Indiana are the sites under
consideration for the new plant.

The new plant will mark a further step for IMCO, the world's largest
specialist aluminium recycler, into the rapidly growing vehicle market
for aluminium. IMCO has already acquired four US plants that supply
recycled aluminium for the manufacture of car components. The firm is
also launching a joint venture with VAW Aluminium AG of Germany to
supply the European market.

JOHNSON CONTROLS USES RECYCLED DRINK BOTTLES TO MAKE SEATS

Johnson Controls has developed an innovative system that enables soft
drink bottles to be recyled for use in car seats. The company's
Automotive Systems Group is the world's leading supplier of automotive
seating and now employs PET (polyethylene terephthalate) from recycled
plastic drink bottles to manufacture pads for seat backs and cushions.
The first seats manufactured in this way were shown at last year's
Frankfurt Motor Show.

PET seat pads have a number of advantages over the polyurethane foam
pads used in most seats at present. PET-based pads are lighter in
weight, offer more breathability , and can be moulded into a wider
variety of densities for many seating applications. In addition to
their recycled content, the PET-based pads are themselves recyclable.
Further, no adhesives or hazardous chemicals are used in the
manufacturing process and no emissions are produced.

In addition to the use of PET in its seats, Johnson Controls is also
striving to make the seats themselves easier to disassemble and
recycle. This can be achieved by reducing the number of parts used,
standardizing fasteners and avoiding the use of insert-moulded plastic
parts.

FIAT TO EXPAND RECYCLING OFFER

Starting in January of this year, Italian drivers can leave any make of
old car at a Fiat retailer without charge and without being obliged to
purchase a new Fiat car. The firm is offering an assurance that it will
forward the vehicles to an ecologically sound recycling centre.

By expanding its scheme, Fiat is aiming to recycle 100,000 of the 1.5
million cars scrapped in Italy each year. The programme will form
Europe's biggest car recycling project, and builds on the success of
previous company initiatives which have so far involved recycling
150,000 cars with the recovery of 2,700 tonnes of glass, 900 tonnes of
plastic and 1,100 tonnes of upholstery.

Technical details of Fiat's FARE recycling scheme can be found in
October 1995's issue of AEA.

GREENPEACE DESIGNS CAR

In an intriguing change of role, one of the traditional adversaries of
the motor industry, Greenpeace, has designed a fuel-efficient car. The
environmental pressure group decided to take to the drawing board after
being frustrated with what they saw as industry's intransigence in
reducing the fuel consumption of new cars.

The aim of the project was to demonstrate that safety and performance
need not suffer in the drive to produce a more environmentally friendly
car. The venture began with a production model Renault Twingo and a
target of 50% improvement in fuel efficiency. Three Swiss companies
(Wenko AG, Esoro AG and BRM Design) were commissioned to help in the
transformation of the car. The main changes made were:

* Engine: the original engine has been replaced with a smaller,
supercharged four- stroke petrol engine. This engine produces the same
output (50 hp) as the engine in the production model whilst consuming
significantly less fuel. A diesel engine was ruled out on the grounds
of its weight and complexity along with the potential health threats
from particulates.

* Weight: a group of designers modified the standard car body to reduce
the vehicle weight by about 20%, from 810kg to 650kg.

* Wind resistance: wind tunnel tests showed that alterations to the
vehicle had also succeeded in producing a 30% reduction in wind
resistance.

Other modifications included the introduction of tyres with lower
rolling resistance, and the fitting of a speed governor set at 130 km/h
(80 mph).

The vehicle was scheduled to undergo road and fuel consumption tests
during December 1995. Prior to the results of those tests, Greenpeace
was anticipating that the car was capable of doing 100 kilometres on
between 3 and 3.5 litres of petrol, the equivalent of between 80 and 95
mpg. The modifications made to the vehicle would add around #1,000 to
the cost of a production Twingo. Of course, if significant fuel savings
were realised during actual use, the extra cost of the vehicle could
soon be recouped through reduced fuel costs.

Greenpeace claims that there is a market for highly fuel-efficient
vehicles, citing public opinion polls in Germany showing that two-
thirds of all car buyers would opt for such a car if it were offered
for sale. Despite its apparent design success, Greenpeace is at pains
to point out that the project is for demonstration purposes only and
that it has no intention of becoming a car manufacturer.

NEW ROVER 200 SERIES CARS DESIGNED FOR FUEL EFFICIENCY

The new Rover 200 Series models show innovative features in engine and
transmission design which contribute to better fuel efficiency and
lower emissions.

All of the 12 models available in the range use engines from Rover's K
(petrol) and L (diesel) series.

K Series engines: Four versions of the Rover K series engine feature in
the new 200 range, ranging from the 1.4 litre, 8-valve 75PS unit to the
1.8 litre 16 valve 145PS unit fitted with Rover's patented Variable
Valve Control system.

All of the engines in the K family feature ultra-light sandwich
construction of low pressure aluminium sand castings, held together by
high-tensile through-bolts for strength and low distortion. Efficiency
is a key concern and is apparent throughout from the advanced
combustion management to the low coolant volume, which gives a fast
warm-up ensuring minimum emissions and fuel consumption from a cold
start.

All 1.4 and 1.6 litre engines in the 200 range have a grouped injection
strategy, in which alternate pairs of injectors are fired in turn,
giving improved efficiency compared with the previous method of banked
injection where all four injectors fired simultaneously.

L Series engines: Two versions of the L series direct injection 2 litre
turbo-diesel engine are available in the 200 range. The lower-cost
version has conventional mechanically-controlled fuel injection, and
develops a maximum power output of 86PS.

Of more interest is the sophisticated 105PS version. This engine
employs an ultra- efficient combustion system, with near-vertical fuel
injectors firing directly into compact re-entrant shaped combustion
chambers formed in the tops of the pistons. Two-stage fuel injection
allows quieter and cleaner operation by initiating combustion more
progressively.

Emissions control features include exhaust gas recirculation (EGR),
which adds a calculated amount of exhaust gas to the inlet charge to
limit combustion temperatures and minimise emissions of nitrogen
oxides. A two-way oxidising catalyst is also fitted to the exhaust
system to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and
particulates.

All of the models in the 200 series are capable of meeting the next
stage of European Union emissions legislation which comes into effect
in 1997.

Transmissions: In addition to the manual and conventional automatic
transmissions available, the 216 models are available with the option
of a CVT (continuously variable transmission). CVT provides a lively
response to the throttle but is also capable of delivering better fuel
economy than conventional automatic transmissions.

CVT effectively provides an infinite number of ratios instead of the
four or five ratio steps typically available. The key working parts are
two pulleys with conical driving faces which have working diameters
that can be varied by means of hydraulic control of the spacing between
the driving faces. In Rover's own tests, the vehicle fitted with CVT
showed better fuel economy than the vehicle with a conventional
automatic transmission. Indeed, the CVT car even bettered the economy
of the vehicle with a manual transmission.

US 55 MPH SPEED LIMIT ABOLISHED

Despite strong misgivings about the safety implications, President
Clinton has signed a bill which abolishes the US national speed limit
of 55 mph (88 km/h) and allows individual states to set their own
limits. The law came into effect in early December and nine of the 50
states had existing laws that automatically raised speed limits in the
absence of a national limit. A further 28 states are likely to
introduce speed limits set higher than 55 mph in the next few months.

The move has been greeted with despair by safety campaigners who claim
that an extra 6,000 deaths will result. Supporters of the limit's
abolition were jubilant and dismissed the safety fears as unjustified.
In reality, the effects of speed limits upon accident rates are complex
and there are numerous studies available to back up both sides of the
argument.

OECD RECOMMENDS THAT CANADA RAISE TRANSPORT TAXES

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has
recommended that Canada should increase the level of taxation on
transport to meet its commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In a review of Canada's environmental performance, the OECD points out
that Canada has committed to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990
levels by the year 2000 and thereafter to start reducing emissions.
However, current projections show a 13% increase in CO2 emissions
between 1990 and 2000. To help close the gap between projection and
target, the OECD recommends using economic instruments such as taxes
and other charges in the transportation sector. The study notes that
the Canadian tax on petrol represents about 47% of the consumer price,
one of the lowest proportions among OECD countries.

The review is being considered by the Canadian government and
indications so far are that the recommendations may be acted upon. The
Canadian environment minister, Sheila Copps, has made it clear that she
is examining the whole range of fiscal options including raising
existing taxes, introducing new charges and adopting a system of
tradeable permits. Ms Copps concurs with the OECD's view that voluntary
measures will be insufficient to meet Canada's stabilisation target for
CO2.

THAI GOVERNMENT TO CRACK DOWN ON MOTORCYCLES

The Thai government is understood to be studying new incentives to
reduce pollution. The newly elected administration of Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-archa has made it clear that it intends to introduce
policies based upon the polluter pays principle. Specifically targeted
in the vehicle sector will be motorcycles powered by highly polluting
two-stroke engines. Around 500,000 such vehicles are sold annually and
they can be expected to be subject to much higher sales tax in 1996.

Thailand's new-found environmental concern follows persistent criticism
of the government for neglecting the environment in its drive towards
rapid economic development.

EC VEHICLE RECYCLING DIRECTIVE THIS YEAR

The European Commission is preparing a new directive aimed at
harmonising the recycling of vehicles across member states. The
production of a Waste Framework Directive was listed in the Commission
s work programme for 1996.

It is widely anticipated that the directive will place responsibility
for end-of-life recovery upon the motor industry. To promote recycling,
the directive is also likely to include provisions for scrapping
incentives so that owners of old, highly polluting vehicles are
encouraged to trade them in for less polluting new cars.

The detailed timetable for the proposal of the directive is uncertain
as the Commission is already facing a significant backlog of measures
carried forward from the 1995 work programme.

LOBBYING INCREASES ON US NLEV PROGRAMME

The US continues to supply the most engrossing of the big battles for
the motor industry. Currently, the EPA's proposal for a national low
emissions vehicle (NLEV) programme is causing friction between the
vehicle manufacturers and the oil companies. The programme is intended
to define a low-emissions vehicle for the entire US. Formal comments
are currently being made on the plan and lobbying by representatives of
the two protagonists has been intense.

The oil companies are concerned that they will be required to produce a
new fuel specification for the programme and have insisted that a
national fuel is technologically unnecessary for the achievement of
Clean Air Act goals. Further, in a now familiar refrain, the industry
has asserted that the provision of a national fuel would have a
devastating economic impact on the refining industry, jeopardising the
very existence of many firms.

For its part, the motor industry has long used the electric vehicle
mandates in California, New York, Massachusetts and Vermont as
bargaining counters in their negotiations on the NLEV scheme. Even with
California back-tracking on its mandate, the manufacturers continue to
assert that they cannot realistically move forward on the NLEV
programme until all the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates have been
dropped.

Thus far, the EPA is retaining a cautious stance and has not shown
favour to either industry's viewpoint. However, once firm proposals are
made, the lobbying from all sides is expected to be stepped up another
gear.

IMPLICATIONS OF TRANSPORT POLICY FOR ENGINEERING INDUSTRY

The Engineering Employers Federation (EEF) has published a report that
considers the different aspects of transport policy and their
importance for the engineering industry. The body of the report
consists of a study carried out for the EEF by the Henley Centre that
considers the transport policies of the UK government along with those
proposed by opposition parties and special interest groups.

Based upon the findings of the Henley Centre study, the EEF calls for a
comprehensive and integrated transport strategy which effectively deals
with the issues of competitiveness and environmental protection . The
EEF lays particular emphasis upon the need for investment plans to
provide integrated transport systems and cleaner technologies.
Specifically, these plans should include a vision of the transport
technologies which will be available two or three decades ahead, in
order to realise the full potential of low-pollution vehicle
technologies. The EEF favours this approach rather than what they see
as the current trend of focusing upon restricting transport or travel
because of the shortcomings of current technologies. The report offers
support for the use of fiscal incentives to promote environmental
objectives and backs the SMMT's call for scrapping incentives to be
introduced.

The government is urged to resist the temptation to make further cuts
in infrastructure spending. The EEF are critical of the wild swings of
recent government investment in transport equipment and believe that
the lack of planning in investment policy shows that the government
lacks a credible industrial policy.

IPCC RE-AFFIRMS BELIEF IN GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE

The latest report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) shows greater consensus that global warming is
occurring and that human beings are responsible. The IPCC is made up of
around 2,500 scientists, climatologists and experts from more than 100
nations. The group's tasks comprise assessing the scientific evidence
of climate change, calculating its impact and devising responses.

The scientific part of the programme unveiled its latest report in Rome
last month. The group concluded that the balance of evidence suggests a
discernible human influence on global climate . The scientists also put
forward their best estimate that mean surface temperature will be 2oC
higher in the year 2100 than in 1990. This comparatively small increase
masks larger, localised temperature changes and important shifts in
climatic patterns such as storm frequencies.

Road traffic is the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide, the main
greenhouse gas, throughout much of the world. If evidence of climate
change continues to gather, attention will become increasingly focused
on the growing numbers of road vehicles and, more importantly, their
escalating use.

AA: RESPONSE TO THE GREAT TRANSPORT DEBATE

The UK Automobile Association (AA) has published its response to the 20
questions on transport and the environment posed by Dr Brian Mawhinney
when UK Secretary of State for Transport.

Some of the main opinions put forward by the AA are detailed below:

* CO2 emissions: transport is being unfairly targeted for reduced CO2
emissions by the annual increase in road fuel tax of 5% above
inflation. This policy does not make economic sense and should be
reviewed.

* Toxic emissions: effective policing of emissions from vehicles is
required, carried out at a local level. The AA supports the principle
of roadside emissions testing, as allowed under the 1995 Environment
Act.

* Traffic growth: economic growth and traffic growth cannot be
uncoupled to a significant extent. Restrictions on car use would
undoubtedly help improve air quality, but the improvements would be
marginal when compared with the gains already being brought about by
technological advances.

* Road pricing: user charging would have to be widely accepted as a
legitimate transport policy tool before it could be implemented. The AA
believes it to be a longer-term policy option.

* Motoring taxation: incentives should be used to encourage the sale of
vehicles with lower emissions. Further, a fundamental review of
motoring taxation is required, with a view to improving the
environmental performance of vehicles through fiscal incentives and
penalties.

In summary, the AA believes that the key to a successful transport and
environment strategy is a combination of investment to provide levels
of access at a standard people expect, and traffic restraint/
management that people accept as being sensible. The AA considers that
going with the grain of people's lives is the only way of securing
acceptable and achievable transport policy objectives if the electorate
cannot see the sense in the measure, or it is perceived to be unfair,
it will be rejected.

Transport: the way ahead the AA's response is available from AA Public
Policy (tel: 0 (44) 1256 491926).

BODY AND CHASSIS INNOVATIONS

Conference on Materials for Lean Weight Vehicles: Part One

Innovation, both in materials and in methods of assembling structural
components, was covered in a topical conference on Materials for Lean
Weight Vehicles organised by The Institute of Materials and held at
Warwick in the UK in late November 1995. It was attended by about 130
delegates, mainly from Europe and representing automotive
manufacturers, component makers, material suppliers and research
institutes. AEA attended and presents its summing up in two parts this
month covering the body and chassis papers.

Weight saving current position

Increases in the weight of the car of today stem from the modern
customer's requirement for increased safety, performance, comfort and
pleasure. Items which at one time were optional extras are now
standard, and this in turn spawns a new spate of optional extras as
manufacturers vie with each other to tempt the customer.

Despite the increasing use of lightweight materials the weight of cars
on average has increased. For example the kerb weight of a Ford Fiesta
in 1976 was about 700 kg and there was little difference between the
basic model and the high series; the 1994 version has a basic kerb
weight of about 800 kg rising to 1000 kg for the high series. However,
customers expect and even demand good driving characteristics in
acceleration and power, combined with improved fuel consumption and a
good image. Stronger engines are necessary to provide effective power.
But stronger engines require heavier transmission and suspension
components leading to further increases in vehicle weight.

Such changes have led the weight spiral, especially in luxury cars.
Acceleration, rolling and hill climbing resistance are directly
proportional to mass and combined probably make up between 70% and 80%
of the total road resistance. So, unchecked, a weight spiral leads
directly to progressive increases in road resistance and increased fuel
consumption. To break this, vehicle weight must be reduced.

The reduction of vehicle weight has focused on engineering effort
because lightweight component developments present potential
disadvantages which have to be resolved and which may require novel
technical or manufacturing solutions. Automotive manufacturers have to
comply with global legislation which is constantly being reviewed and
updated. Emissions regulations necessitate significant improvements in
engine and vehicle efficiency, and in the USA the Corporate Average
Fuel Economy (CAFE) legislation dictates a minimum average fuel economy
across manufacturer's range. A lower weight vehicle facilitates
improved efficiency and can be achieved by vehicle downsizing, reducing
individual component weight contributions or an entirely new structural
design.

Lightweight structures may enable smaller engines to be used without
impairing performance. But there are problems. The cost of lighter
weight materials or associated process routes may be higher than for
established practice. This is likely to be so for advanced materials,
such as metal matrix composites (MMCs). Thus the rule must be to
minimise waste wherever possible by using near net shape techniques. It
should also be remembered that development of alternative materials and
processes inevitably incurs an element of additional cost which has to
be recovered through savings.

Moreover, confidence has to be gained by quality validation and
inspection analysis which must continue for a long period into the
initial production runs. Technical knowledge needs to be constantly
available for the volume supply of raw materials at acceptable cost and
for the processing route to achieve the required component forms. A co-
ordinated approach to component design philosophy is therefore
necessary since the materials, design form and manufacturing route are
intricately interlinked; and successful implementation of a weight
reduction programme will depend on sources and details of each of the
three elements. Computerised component design and analysis systems are
essential to enable the optimisation of shape to meet performance
criteria which can yield significant weight reductions in the use of
established or alternative materials.

The automobile body is the largest and also the heaviest individual
component, accounting for 20% to 30% of vehicle weight. It therefore
presents the greatest potential for reductions. Targeting body weight
also permits secondary savings. But reducing car weight must go hand in
hand with more rigidity, greater safety and better handling
characteristics. Hence the joining and forming methods and the chassis
should also come under the microscope.

Hypercars the next revolution

The Keynote Speaker was Mr Amory B Lovins, Director of Research, Rocky
Mountain Institute, Colorado, USA. Mr Lovins and his team have
developed a unique analytical approach to the design and manufacture of
the car, and his opening speech on Hypercars the next revolution fully
demonstrated this. He pointed out the conflict between customers
wanting better cars which often meant heavier cars and the pressures on
the car manufacturers to reduce the weight of cars to help in meeting
fuel emission regulations through improved fuel consumption. In the US,
average fuel consumption is levelling off at about 8 litres/100 km (35
mpg), with a target of achieving half that rate by the year 2005
through an incremental approach to design and manufacture.

Mr Lovins advocates a leapfrog approach by a direct attack on the
factors which are wasting much of the energy in the fuel. He cited drag
coefficient, frontal area, mass and tyre rolling resistance. Reducing
these would bring about spectacular results. To these improvements he
added a hybrid electric drive with electricity generated onboard
driving all four wheels and the recovery and storage of some of the
electrical energy for re-use. Finally a light carbon fibre body would
reduce the mass still further. He postulated that this approach could
achieve a fuel consumption of at least 4 litres/100 km by the year
2000. Mr Lovins analysis is fascinating and it is planned to give a
fuller account of his work in a later edition of Automotive Environment
Analyst.

Audi's experience with the A8

The first paper was presented by Mr H Behrens (Project Manager
Development, Audi AG) on The aluminium Audi A8 . Audi had collaborated
with Alcoa for over ten years to develop a new body technology called
the Audi Space Frame (ASF) which enabled them to produce the Audi A8,
the world's first automobile to be designed specifically for aluminium
production. The outcome was a vehicle body up to 40% lighter, yet more
rigid and thus safer than a comparable steel body. The body in white
(BIW) weighs about 247 kg, the same as that of the VW Golf BIW. After a
comprehensive analysis aluminium was chosen because:

* it is the third most common metal on earth: thus no potential supply
problems;

* it offers good weight reduction its density is about one third that
of steel;

* it has good dimensioning possibilities;

* it offers reduction in waste of raw material in production;

* the strength of deep drawn heat treated aluminium and steel are about
the same;

* it offers ease of recycling.

The main disadvantage of aluminium is that its elastic modulus and
therefore its stiffness is only about one third that of steel. This
dictated the use of an ASF into which each surface component is
integrated with a load bearing function. Novel features are a frame
structure of straight or curved extruded sections with vacuum
diecastings at nodal points where the loads are highest, together with
load bearing sheet aluminium surface components. Individual elements in
the frame are metal inert gas welded together and the sheet is joined
mainly by self-piercing punch rivets.

Safety is also an important feature. The combination of lightness and
rigidity means that an automobile with an ASF body performs better than
a heavier vehicle during a handling course. The ASF body easily
satisfies current safety legislation and combines two vital passive
safety features: a rigid cage-like passenger survival space and energy
absorbing members providing tolerable deceleration rates. However
crashes which necessitate repairs are inevitable and Audi claims that a
normal dealer bodyshop can perform 95% of all accident repair work and
only where the frame has been damaged does an ASF vehicle have to be
taken to a specialist bodyshop.

To date 20,000 of the A8 model have been built and the current
production rate is 60 to 70 cars per day. Looking ahead Audi knows that
it will get more savings in weight by using an aluminium monocoque, but
this will involve bonding sheets together. Work is continuing on this
and there may be something to report within the next three years.

Steel's potential for lightweighting

The rivalry between aluminium and steel as the major material for the
construction of cars, particularly car bodies, became apparent in the
presentation of the next paper, titled The ultra light steel auto body
, by

Mr E F Walker and Mr K Lowe of British Steel Strip Products. Mr Walker
said that the pattern of steel developments has demonstrated the steel
industry's response to the changing requirements of improved body
designs, greater durability and more recently the demands for weight
reduction to improve fuel consumption and air quality. Steel producers
have traditionally collaborated with their customers on a one-to-one
basis to develop the quality of their materials. This has contributed
to weight reduction mainly through agreements on the optimum grade and
gauge required after a detailed study of manufacturing and performance
demands of each part of the vehicle body. The development of high
strength steels has also contributed to vehicle weight reduction. Re-
phosphorised and bake-hardened steels can be used for body panels with
high strength low alloy (HSLA) steels and dual- phase steels for
underbody and structural parts.

While these developments do produce weight savings, something more
substantial is required. In the USA a 1993 study to evaluate the
potential for weight reduction reported that it was possible to reduce
the weight of a mid-size American car by nearly 64 kg, remove 50 parts
and lower variable manufacturing cost by $40. In early 1994, the world
s steel companies, including British Steel, formed a consortium to
pursue the next steps in vehicle weight reduction using steel. The
Ultra Light Steel Auto Body (ULSAB) project was launched in July 1994,
funded by 32 steel companies from 15 countries. The aim was to design
and build a lightweight efficient body structure which would be viable
for mass production and would meet a high level of functional and
structural performance. Mr Walker went on to describe the work on this
project to date and this is reported on page 18 in the article Steel
Threats and Responses .

The challenge from high modulus composites

A look into the future followed, with the presentation of the results
of research into the use of new materials and designs. The paper The
MOSAIC front structure in HMC a unique approach to lightweighting was
presented by Mr P Valersteinas of Renault and Mr J Penon and

Mr H E Rowlands of DSM Resins. MOSAIC Material Optimisation for a
Structural Automotive Innovative Concept was a European research
project (under the EUREKA programme) on materials for use in automobile
production. Masterminded by Renault, it brought together a car
manufacturer and raw material producers. MOSAIC led to two prototype
cars based on the Renault Clio, one made in steel and the other in a
hybrid structure of aluminium and composite material. Project time was
four years from 1991, and the budget FFr350 million. Partners in the
second prototype were Renault, Norsk Hydro for the aluminium space
frame, Enichem and Montecatini for the floor pan, DSM for the front
structure, and Ciba- Geigy for the bonding technology. The design
strategy was based on simultaneous engineering principles in that from
the concept stage designers, material technologists and process and
production specialists worked together on design development in close
co-operation with Renault.

DSM had to develop a new composite for the front end in order to meet
the performance criteria. It was Shimoco HMC (high modulus compound)
and consisted of vinyl ester thermosetting resin, mineral fillers,
reinforcing glass fibres and additives such as curing agent and
pigment. An additional bonus was that up to 10% of recycled HMC can be
used in the mix without any change in the properties of the final
product. In total, 25 complete front structures were made in this
material using full production equipment, and they passed testing for
fatigue, stiffness, ageing and crash by Renault. An industrial assembly
model has indicated that a fully assembled front structure can be
produced from the parts in 50 seconds. DSM concluded that HMC had been
validated as a structural material for cars in that it gives:

* lower manufacturing costs due to lean production (80 parts on the
standard Clio reduced to 9 with HMC);

* substantially lower investment costs;

* increased production flexibility from 50 to 2,000 cars per day can be
produced with a linear capital cost increase;

* weight reductions of 30% compared to steel (similar to aluminium).

DSM concluded that composites remain in the position of challenger to
traditional materials such as steel, which continues to be the
reference point in the car industry. This paper was interesting in that
it showed that composites can be used for the manufacture of the more
extensive parts of a car, and it highlighted once again that research
collaboration between a car manufacturer and raw material producers
across Europe can be beneficial to those concerned.

The aluminium monocoque

A further contribution on the use of aluminium came from Mr D J
Meadows, European Automotive Group, Alcan International Ltd in a paper
The aluminium monocoque BIW the facts, not fiction .

There are two options, the conventional stamped sheet monocoque (SSM)
which offers up to 50% weight saving compared to a spot welded steel
car, and the extruded space frame (ESF) which would give 30% to 40%
saving. Both have their advocates, the latter's advantages being that
tooling costs are claimed to be low and model changes can be effected
without major structural modification; but to the largest producers of
cars the former offers the greatest weight saving and the least change
from their current manufacturing practices and thus is more likely to
be chosen. Therefore, in order to maximise the weight savings of a SSM,
Alcan has developed a technology known as AVT which encompasses
materials, surfaces and joining methods that include adhesive bonding
and spot welding. AVT is based on the use of a pre-treated and pre-
lubricated material and bonding with an advanced heat curing epoxy
adhesive developed with Ciba-Geigy.

Alcan has worked with a number of motor manufacturers on an SSM BIW
which was fully motorised and subject to full vehicle structural
evaluation programmes, with creditable overall results. Motor cars have
been built on the SSM principle for many years and production
processes, manufacturing equipment and knowledge have been refined to
produce the lowest cost vehicles. Alcan decided to stick with this
route, recognising that for a manufacturer to change to building
aluminium ESFs would entail not only the use of a new material but also
rendering much of the existing manufacturing knowledge and equipment
redundant.

The relative merits of SSM and Clad ESF have been stated by Alcan as
shown in Table 1 overleaf.

Attention was drawn to Ford's increasing commitment to aluminium
following the Aluminium Intensive Vehicle. For model year 1997 the cab
of Ford's new truck will be made of adhesive bonded aluminium and will
weigh just 113 kg. There will also be over 100,000 bonnets and boots in
aluminium on Ford cars.

                                       packaging requirements

Already 5% of a car's weight is of aluminium mostly components and by
the year 2000 Alcan is predicting the production of the first monocoque
body (presumably for a mass produced car). By 2015 it expects about 15%
of a car to be of aluminium with increased use for both components and
skins.

Weldbonded steel performance

A growing interest in adhesives was demonstrated by a paper on High
impact performance weldbonded steel bodyshells by Mr R E Davis of Ford
Motor Co Ltd and Mr J H Powell of Ciba Polymers. Currently adhesives
are widely used in many applications on automotive body shells for
bonding closure panels, roofs, reinforcements and direct glazing, but
in highly demanding applications adhesive bonds make little
contribution to the overall impact energy absorption of the structure.
The design benefits of adhesives are improved joint stiffness and
fatigue resistance, design freedom and manufacturing flexibility. For
these to be obtained in other areas of the body structure adhesive
joints must be able to perform as well as spot welded joints when
subjected to impact, since most areas could be required to withstand
impact loads when the vehicle is in service.

New tests were developed which represent better what happens to parts
of the vehicle when subjected to impact, and these were used to
evaluate tougher stronger epoxy adhesives which had been developed in
parallel. The tests involve box beams which are representative of the
load carrying members of a steel monocoque bodyshell such as pillars,
crossmembers, sidemembers and also front ends. In the latter the box
beam type members of a bodyshell are constrained by large panels such
as the floor pan or inner wings and the ends are generally fixed to
other members when being crushed in a collision.

With the new stronger epoxy adhesive the tests proved to be
satisfactory. Spotwelded beams were also tested to provide the basis
for comparison. Coated steels (electrogalvanised, hot dip galvanised
and galvannealed) were also box beam tested. Both electrogalvanised and
hot dip galvanised steel beams behaved similarly to mild steel beams,
but galvannealed beams had worse performance. The potential for
comparison came from a study of the thickness of the steel used in the
tests. It was found that weldbonded beams were able to maintain a
higher average collapse force and less impact deformation across a
range of gauges compared to spotwelded beams. The results suggest that
some members could be reduced in weight by around 15%.

PSA's TULIP concept vehicle

The final paper of this session given by Mr P M Parrott of Automotive
Technology Ltd (representing PSA Peugeot-Citroen Group), was on The
TULIP concept vehicle . Since 1991 the PSA Peugeot-Citroen Group has
been developing more appropriate urban cars for example the electric
versions of both the Peugeot 106 and Citroen AX. What is now being
proposed is a medium term vision of urban transport giving individual
freedom to the general public. This new concept, called TULIP
(Transport Urbain, Libre, Individuel et Public), would put at the
disposal of a great many customers a compact two seater electric
vehicle.

The TULIP concept draws on development work carried out by PSA in
partnership with SORA Composites Group to produce a composite car body
with limits to the number of structural vehicle parts, the number of
materials used (initially from the range of composite materials) and
the manufacturing time. It was from these that the TULIP vehicle
emerged consisting of just five primary elements structurally bonded
together with an epoxy adhesive. Each of the five parts is comprised of
a rigid polyurethane foam core wrapped in a preformed glass fibre mat
which is then injected with polyester resin. The process is called
resin transfer moulding (RTM). The resultant assembly weighs about 33%
less than the equivalent steel structure. There is also an element of
recycling in the manufacture of the vehicle in that waste glass fibre
can be ground and used as a stiffener in the foam core, thereby
allowing a lower density foam to be used.

Light weight materials for brakes

The first paper in the chassis session was an Investigation of light
weight materials for brake rotor applications , and presented by Dr D
Grieve,

Dr D C Barton and Prof. D A Crolla of the Department of Engineering,
University of Leeds, Mr J D Buckingham, Rover Cars Ltd, and Mr J
Chapman, BBA Friction.

It is well known that during braking the kinetic energy of the moving
vehicle is converted into thermal energy. This thermal energy is stored
by the thermal mass of the brake rotor (currently cast iron) and
dissipation of this stored energy takes place by convection and
radiation from the free surfaces of the brake. Moreover the brake,
rotor and stator, must be capable of operating over a wide range of
temperatures ( 40 to 800oC) without the loss of structural integrity
and excessive thermal distortion. With two or four discs per vehicle,
each weighing between 3 kg and 5 kg, a significant saving can be
achieved by replacement of the conventional cast iron disc with a
lighter alternative.

The materials chosen for investigation were a high temperature steel, a
copper- nickel alloy and a variety of composites (aluminium-MMC,
magnesium-MMC, carbon-carbon and Salon 101) but prior to that a
functional analysis of the braking system was undertaken to determine
the direction and scope of the research. This involved three different
tests (cooling test, alpine descent and fade test) carried out on the
test vehicle (Rover 200) after which these results were compared with a
simulation using a finite element model. Once the model had been
validated it was used to examine a number of materials under the
conditions experienced in the three different tests. The effects of
disc thickness were also studied.

All materials except Al-MMC were found to have serious drawbacks.
However an Al-MMC disc brake had shortcomings in that it would require
both improved cooling and thicker cheeks to keep surface temperatures
below the quoted maximum and operating temperatures. It has to be
concluded that a more effective and lighter substitute for cast iron as
a brake rotor is still some way off.

Forging of MMCs

Still on the theme of brakes, there followed a scientific paper on
Forging of an MMC for an automotive component by Messrs A M de Sanctis,
E Evangelista and A Forcellese, Department of Mechanics, University of
Ancona, Italy, and Mr A Fuganti, Fiat Centre Research, Orbassano,
Italy. The paper described research on a lightweight alternative to the
cast iron brake drum.

It was estimated that a weight reduction of about 40% could be obtained
by substituting the grey cast iron with aluminium alloy matrix
composites. Frictional tests established that of the three aluminium
composites originally selected, alloy 2618 (aluminium containing 20% Al
2O3 ) was found to be the most attractive to replace cast iron.

A thermal analysis of the brake drum by the finite element method shows
that the good behaviour of the MMC brake drum was predictable, but
experimental tests on components involving repeated braking will be
necessary to verify that the maximum temperature reached on the rubbing
surface is below 400oC (at which severe wear takes place). Also the
temperature close to the wheel hub must be suitable for traditional
wheel bearing application of approximately 120oC continually and 180oC
maximum.

Forging trials and experimental analysis showed that a finished brake
drum satisfying the soundness requirement could be produced, but this
involved machining the critical part of the forging. This caused a
substantial increase in manufacturing cost due to the low machinability
of MMCs. It was concluded that a more accurate forging design and a
proper definition of the forging conditions are required for low cost
manufacturing of defect-free MMC brake drum components. It is worth
recording that this collaborative research work was part funded by the
EU as a BRITE-EURAM project and involved, besides the authors, an MMC
manufacturer, two forging companies, two universities and a research
centre in three EC countries.

Lighter weight for dynamic and structural components

A paper entitled A review of light weight components in dynamic and
structural applications by Mr P R J Addis and Mr D P J Rogers of Jaguar
Cars Engineering Centre discussed, with the aid of case studies,
potential means for developing reduced weight components. Traditional
materials used in structural applications in vehicle manufacturing
which fulfil quite adequately the requirements of strength, integrity,
durability and ease of manufacture are steels, cast iron and aluminium
casting alloys. But low mass options have emerged, and are continuing
to do so.

Aluminium and magnesium are being introduced widely for lower weight
components, but both suffer from lower stiffness compared with their
ferrous counterparts. This can be overcome by good practice in design
and manufacturing. Speculation is now mounting about the use of the
aerospace material titanium, now that sources of lower cost titanium
alloy powders and finished parts are becoming available from Eastern
Europe. Its use could be in reciprocating valve train and other engine
components.

Engineering polymers and composites, which are lighter than metals, are
available for use as structural components in a vehicle's semi-
structural engine components, and suspension tie rods are already
produced from these materials. In manufacturing, emphasis is focusing
on processes which as far as possible will give near net shape, and
enable complicated designs to be achieved with full integrity. Various
developments in the casting, forging and forming industries indicate
that this is possible.

The main obstacles to the introduction of lower weight components were
identified as increased cost and the availability of technology in
respect of potential new materials. However changes are taking place
and four case studies were cited which illustrated the use of new
materials for components and different manufacturing processes:

* Traditionally the crossbeam has been manufactured by welding sheet
steel pressings including brackets and mounting points for the engine
and the wishbones. Substantial corrosion protection is essential. Now
it is planned to replace the steel assembly with a single controlled
fill low pressure diecasting in an aluminium alloy that is fully heat
treatable and has high strength, low corrosion and good impact
properties. A reduction in weight of 10 12 kg, or about 65% of the
original weight, is achieved together with closer tolerances from the
near net shape and relatively simple assembly. However, costs are only
less than steel for lower volume applications.

* Forged alloy steel or high impact nodular cast iron are used for the
steering knuckle, which forms the link between the wishbones and the
steering rod, since it is subject to suspension and steering load in a
high temperature environment. For low volume vehicles, indirect squeeze
castings in aluminium alloys have been introduced with a weight saving
of 3 kg per component. It is expected that such components will be
fitted to high volume, mid-size vehicles in 1996.

* For rear wheel drive vehicles the drivetrain contributes a
substantial proportion of the gross weight of the vehicles. Its main
component is the propshaft, transmitting power from the gearbox to the
differential on the rear axle. Steel tubes have been universally used
for these driveshafts with forged steel yokes and joints welded into
the ends. A centre bearing, a requisite on some large vehicles, adds to
the weight. Under development is an extruded aluminium alloy tubular
shaft, if necessary wound with continuous carbon fibre for extra
stiffness and better load bearing capability. Yokes of forged or
squeeze cast aluminium alloy are welded into the tube. The lower mass
permits higher whirl speeds and removes the need for a centre bearing
and two part system on large vehicles. Weight savings of around 50% are
being estimated, however difficulties remain. The lightweight component
materials are more expensive (though this might be offset by ease of
assembly). The large diameter of the shaft may also present problems in
system packaging.

* A connecting rod reciprocates at high velocity whilst being subject
to high compressive and inertia forces. Space limitations have
traditionally restricted material choice to forged alloy steel and, for
some lower stress applications, nodular cast iron. Extensive machining
and balancing operations are the norm. Under development is a
sinterforged alloy steel connecting rod manufactured from powder. More
than 20% weight saving has been obtained compared with a forged part
for a similar application arising from the very high accuracy of the
process and the absence of a balancing requirement.

On being questioned, the authors said that none of the examples
described were in use in Jaguar cars.

Aluminium production technologies

In a detailed talk on Aluminium control arms in different production
technologies , Mr Karl-Heinz von Zengen of VAW Aluminium AG, Bonn,
Germany, showed that for the manufacture of any component there is no
general best solution, but for every demand there is a specific best
solution. He pointed out that traditionally a designer tried to solve a
problem by using well known solutions either from within the company or
from a competitor. By adopting this approach it was rare for mistakes
to occur but there was also a distinct lack of innovation.

Also, slavishly sticking to best mechanical or other properties to the
exclusion of all else ignored important realities of production and
cost.

Over the years much has changed. Through the introduction of
simultaneous engineering teams and quality function deployment, a more
precise definition of the development's goal is given and more
development work is put out to potential producers. The result is a
faster innovation cycle and the prospects of lower development costs.
The production routes which Mr Zengen covered were forging, extruding,
casting, rolling/drawing and welding and the example component was a
control arm.

Forging is the classical production technology for highly stressed
components especially in chassis applications. To make the component
cheap in production it is best to have a constant cross-section over
the whole length. Thicker local areas, for example for the housings of
ball pins or bearings, requires an additional and possibly expensive
dosing process of raw material. It is possible to produce ribs but at a
higher cost. Tooling costs are proportional to the number of parts
produced.

Extruding is the process to use for components with complicated but
constant cross-sections over large lengths. Typical applications are
roof and seat rails, and from Audi all window frames for movable
windows. In larger sections there are front and rear cross beams of
cars and side panels of heavy trucks. With extruding only, limited
three-dimensional shape is possible, integration of housing is
impossible and tooling is independent of the number of parts.

Casting dominates the use of aluminium in automotive applications with
a share of roughly 85%. Applications in the chassis area are typically
crossbeams for multi link axles, hollow wishbones and similar
components in low scale production cars. It is now possible to produce
aluminium castings with good ductility by a vacuum assisted high
pressure die casting technique. Control arms of multi link axles have
been manufactured by this method and are being used in the new Porsche
911 series.

Control arms can also be produced by rolling and deep drawing aluminium
sheet but there are drawbacks in that relatively high tooling costs
necessitate large daily and total production numbers, and the thin wall
thickness requires broad flanges and a large drawing depth which can
lead to package problems. VAW are currently developing a process to
manufacture control rods from a seam welded aluminium alloy tube with
ends flattened to form the flange and drilled for the bushes. In this
process limited three dimensionality is possible by bending. There is a
high stiffness to weight ratio and tool costs depend upon the number of
parts.

In conclusion there was a stark reminder that even if the geometric
conditions for the five different technologies are identical, the
behaviour of the part in these different technologies is different.

Magnesium diecastings

Continuing the light metal theme was a paper on Magnesium diecastings
in automotive body/chassis applications by Mr P D Caton of Diemakers
Ltd, Slough, UK, and Mr K Barnes of Diemakers Inc, Monroe City, USA.

Mr Caton said that while magnesium diecastings have a higher strength
to weight ratio than aluminium diecastings or car body steel most
European vehicles currently contain very little or no magnesium.
Against this, American vehicles now contain an average of around 3 kg
per vehicle and this figure is rising significantly. It was the need
for weight reductions to meet the CAFE regulations which stimulated
North American engineers to look wider for their choice of materials.
The use of magnesium in diecasting in the USA has risen from 4,000
tonnes in 1982 to 16,000 tonnes in 1990, and dramatically to an
estimated 40,000 tonnes in 1995. By contrast European usage reached a
peak of 20,000 tonnes in 1984, declined by about half by 1988, but is
expected to reach 11,000 tonnes in 1995 on a clear upward trend.

In 1982 magnesium diecastings were used by Ford for the brake and
clutch pedal support brackets on its pickup trucks with a saving of 1.7
kg on a component which weighed 2.3 kg in steel. Now it is extensively
used in this capacity by both Ford and Chrysler. By the 1990s Ford were
using diecastings for more demanding applications in the form of the
main actuator housing and key-lock housing in the steering column
assembly.

The principal reason for considering the use of magnesium is usually
weight reduction. However, less well known properties of magnesium, for
example low heat content and low reactivity to steel, result in higher
productivity and longer die lives when compared with aluminium
diecastings. Moreover the good fluidity of molten magnesium permits the
casting of complex components containing fine details. The low heat
content reduces the amount of thermal distortion, enabling close
tolerances to be met with the possibility of avoiding a secondary
machining operation. Another attractive property is magnesium's high
damping capacity which makes diecastings suitable for engine components
such as valve covers (as specified by Ford, BMW, Toyota and Mercedes-
Benz) and for the steering wheel core. Other applications which are now
receiving attention in the USA and Europe are the integrated dash panel
or car cross-beam, and the prototype development of using diecasting
for door frames and boot lids as means of saving considerable weight. A
diecast magnesium dash panel was used by Audi to introduce airbags for
the V8 model, and General Motors has plans for widespread use of this
design principle. Besides weight saving from using a one piece
magnesium diecasting, there are additional benefits from a reduction in
sub-component diversity and assembly costs, and the exploitation of
magnesium's high damping capacity to absorb noise and vibrations
emanating from the steering column.

But not everything is going well for magnesium and its diecasters. The
price of magnesium in 1995 is up 15% on that in 1994, and there is a
problem obtaining supplies. Mr Caton claimed that this was a result of
poor forecasting of demand about three years ago which prompted the
closure of two production plants. However, two big plants, in Australia
and Israel, are coming on stream in about a year and the prediction is
that the price of magnesium should return to its 1994 level.

Plastic pedals

A paper on an even lighter material, plastic, ended the session.
Presented by Mr I S Rendell, Deputy Managing Director of Birkby
Plastics Ltd, it was titled Light weight plastic pedals . He said that
traditionally pedals have been produced by stamping quite heavy gauged
metal sheet or using steel or aluminium rods. After which extensive
welding, machining, assembly and protective coating were required, all
of which added to the cost. Now the space limitation in the footwell
area has further complicated the design of the pedals and pedal box
assembly, inhibiting the use of metals. This, plus the requirements for
weight and cost reductions, led to the use of injection moulded plastic
parts. These can be of complex designs with integrated functions and
are produced in a single operation. Plastics have achieved a 30% to 60%
reduction in weight at reduced cost.

Worldwide, about 80 million accelerator and brake pedals and about 60
million clutch pedals are produced each year. Europe has been changing
to plastic pedals in the past 10 years; similar movement in the USA
occurred much later. Birkby started to supply Ford with plastic
accelerator pedals for its Fiesta in 1988; the pedal weighed 120
grammes compared with the steel version's 256 grammes; the pedal on the
1995 Fiesta weighs only 100 grammes. Most European car manufacturers
now fit plastic accelerator pedals into their vehicles. However the
term plastic does not do justice to the material or its function; it is
actually a plastic composite consisting of nylon and a filler of 40%
short glass fibres.

Car manufacturers such as VW, BMW, Fiat and Ford are also introducing
plastic clutch pedals on their latest models. The performance
requirement of a clutch pedal is far more severe than that of an
accelerator pedal. Clutch pedals normally operate at a force of 100 to
150 Newtons, two to three times that of accelerators at 40 to 60
Newtons. The weight saving is dramatic; metal clutch pedals weigh 480
to 630 grammes and plastic ones 220 to 250 grammes. Next it will be the
turn of the brake pedal it is thought that Fiat could be the first
manufacturer to launch it.

In fact it is logical to make the whole pedal box assembly in plastic
as Fiat is already doing with the Fiat Ducato system. There are over 50
parts in the average metal pedal box assembly whereas the Fiat system
has less than half that number. In metal it weighs nearly 6 kg and in
plastic only 2.7 kg. There is also a reputed 20% cost saving.

The second part of this conference report, covering the joining and
forming and under bonnet topics, will appear in the February 1996 issue
of AEA.

STEEL THREATS AND RESPONSES

The ULSAB project

News that 32 of the world's steel companies from 15 countries had
formed a consortium to fund the Ultra Light Steel Auto Body (ULSAB)
project was remarkable (see CONFERENCE REPORT 1, page 12), and Phase 1
has already been completed. Steel is a highly competitive business with
some companies state owned or state subsidised, so such collaboration
is rare.

It is interesting to speculate on what prompted this move. Two reasons
are high on the list: cars have to be made lighter to help to improve
fuel consumption and meet emission regulations, but there is also an
increasingly serious threat from aluminium as a material for car
bodies. The production of the Audi A8 and Ford's fleet of 40 Aluminium
Intensive Vehicles for testing around the world are prime examples of
the potential threat to steel's market domination. The stakes are high.
This year alone an estimated 38 million cars will be produced worldwide
and, after allowing for the aluminium share, about 10 million tonnes of
steel sheet will have been consumed in the manufacture of bodies-in-
white (BIW). On top of this there is the amount that goes into
commercial vehicles. It is in the interests of all auto sheet producers
that such a huge market be defended. Collaboration on a project to
produce lightweight car bodies therefore makes good sense. It is also
good for the environment.

The ULSAB project was launched in July 1994 with the aim of designing
and building a lightweight efficient body structure which is viable for
mass production and will meet a high level of functional and structural
performance. The consortium commissioned Porsche Engineering Services
in Troy, Michigan, USA, to carry out the project in three phases:

1. Concept phase: this entailed the concept design, engineering and
analysis by Porsche Engineering of a five-seater, medium to large
saloon car.

2. Feasibility phase: this involves detail design, engineering and
analysis, building body demonstration hardware and basic BIW testing.

3. Exploitation phase: this will be the exploitation of the newly
proven opportunities for cost effective weight reduction in vehicle
design and building programmes.

In the analysis of Phase 1, a reference vehicle package was defined
from a study of nine North American, European and Japanese cars which
covered mass, static bending, static torsion, and first BIW vibration
mode. Following this, future reference values were calculated for each
performance parameter, since the ULSAB design will have to compete with
future vehicles. Also included in the study were nine different steels
all currently available to the automotive industry worldwide, nine
product parameters and twelve manufacturing processes all in current
use or capable of immediate implementation. Starting with a projected
vehicle package Porsche Engineering had a free hand in the design of
the ULSAB.

Design concept

Phase 1 has produced a design concept that demonstrates the interaction
between materials and processes. This design concept makes use of
various sheet steels, including high strength, bake hardening and dual
phase types (two thirds of the steels are high strength). Each steel is
matched to appropriate forming processes: deep drawing, roll forming,
hydroforming (5 parts are hydroformed) and tailored blanking (20 out of
78 major parts are tailor blanked). The appropriate joining techniques
such as spot welding, arc welding, laser welding, weld bonding and
mechanical joining are then applied.

Mass production

Considerable attention has been paid to ensuring the viability of the
ULSAB design for mass production. The sequence of assembly operations
for the front structure, underbody, body sides and final assembly have
been detailed. In the framing stages the exterior panels were excluded
in order to provide clearance to welds without access holes because
having large holes for weld gun clearance next to certain joints proved
unacceptable. A mainly conventional overall assembly concept emerged
with an inside-out build sequence being used on a conventional
platform. No major problems are anticipated in producing different body
styles.

Crash analysis

For Phase 1 crash simulation the computer-modelled BIW was fitted with
a bumper system, suspension, fuel tank, doors and a powertrain. The
crash analysis generally adopted a conservative approach. The front and
rear end simulations were performed at 35 mph (56 km/h), exceeding the
30 mph (48 km/h) standard. The 50 km/h side impact analysis was based
on a European side moving barrier test, but with a rigid barrier in
place of the standard deformable one. Porsche Engineering also
confirmed the protection of occupants in roll over crashes.

Performance summary

Based on available vehicle data (benchmark references), the average
body weight of a typical mid-sized saloon was fixed at 271 kg. This
typically represents 20% to 25% of the total vehicle weight. The ULSAB
weighs 205 kg with the same wheelbase, higher torsion and higher
bending rigidity. Body weight can therefore be reduced by up to 35%.
But there is more. The prospect of beginning with a lighter BIW offers
ample opportunity for additional weight reduction in powertrain,
suspension system, wheels and other components. Calculations put these
savings at about 50 kg. Lower fuel consumption, lower emissions and
reduced environmental impacts result from this lighter, more efficient
package.

Using a technical cost modelling (TCM) methodology IBIS Associates, an
independent automotive cost research company in the US, carried out a
costing of alternative designs. It showed that the current conventional
design reference BIW would contain 195 pieces and cost $1,116, and that
the ULSAB BIW would contain 169 pieces and cost $962, a saving of about
14%. This saving arises from a combination of more innovative design,
fewer parts and more efficient manufacture.

Benefits

The advantages from weight saving in steel include the following:

* steel-based weight saving designs and manufacturing technologies can
be implemented quickly because the basic manufacturing structure
already exists;

* this in turn means less risk and lower investment, material and
manufacturing costs for car makers; by contrast the use of alternative
materials such as aluminium requires greater investment in terms of
time and money;

* environmentally the benefits of vehicle weight savings accrue
quickly;

* it is claimed by the steel industry that steel exhibits overall
environmental life cycle advantages: cited are its superior and
demonstrable recyclability and a lower impact in the production process
through lower energy consumption, re- usable solid wastes and a smaller
volume of greenhouse gas emissions.

The future

In Phase 2 of the USLAB study, the steel industry consortium is
investing $20m over the next 24 months to construct demonstration
bodies to verify the design for weight, the ability to manufacture,
rigidity and other performance criteria. The evidence confirms that the
world steel industry is taking a serious approach to the threat from
aluminium, and seems intent on nipping this in the bud.

AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

The conference Effective Local Air Quality Management was held on 29
November 1995 in London and was sponsored by Local Transport Today. The
90 delegates were mostly from local authorities but included
representatives from transport operators, vehicle manufacturers and the
oil industry.

The conference was convened to assist with the development of an
effective transport policy response to the new responsibilities of
local authorities detailed in the 1995 Environment Act. Quite simply,
this Act involves the government handing down to local councils new
duties for ensuring that vehicle emissions do not reach levels which
pose a threat to public health.

This conference report focuses on the papers of greatest interest to
AEA readers and is not intended to be a complete record of the
proceedings.

Air pollution and health not a crisis, but action is needed

Dr Malcolm Green (President, British Lung Foundation) emphasised that
the health effects of the different pollutants that make up air
pollution are often complex and difficult to disentangle. For instance,
severe episodes of nitrogen dioxide pollution seem to be associated
with small increases in mortality, but clinical studies on the effects
of nitrogen dioxide have so far been equivocal. Similarly, despite the
much publicised connection between asthma and air pollution, there is
only anecdotal evidence to support the link.

In contrast, though, numerous studies have found that high levels of
ozone exacerbate respiratory problems. Perhaps of greater significance
for vehicle manufacturers, recent studies of the effects of
particulates seem to have effectively confirmed that diesel engines are
no more environmentally friendly than petrol engines.

Despite the lack of clear-cut evidence, there is now widespread
acceptance that air pollution is an important health issue. There are
no easy solutions to the problems but it now seems apparent that
continuing unrestricted expansion in our use of private cars is not
sustainable. There is a clear need for a rational transport policy.

In conclusion, Dr Green emphasised that while air pollution is a cause
for concern and requires action, it is not causing a health crisis at
present.

UK government strategy for improving air quality

James Clappison (Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the
Environment) outlined the government's policies for improving air
quality.

In March 1994, the government published a consultative document,
Improving Air Quality, which set out wide-ranging proposals on how the
challenge should be met. Subsequently, the government's policies for
air quality management were defined in Air Quality: Meeting the
Challenge. The policies detailed in this document were incorporated
into the Environment Act 1995 and will be used to meet the standards
and targets as due to be defined by the government in December 1995.
Guidance for local authorities on assessing and managing air quality
will also be issued.

The policies of the government can be divided into three main areas:

National air quality standards and targets: new standards and targets
will be established for nine individual pollutants (benzene, ozone, 1,3-
butadiene, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, particulates, nitrogen
oxides, lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Some of these have
already been defined and published during 1995.

The standards adopted reflect the advice of the government's Expert
Panel on Air Quality Standards and are broadly in line with the latest
work of the European Union and the World Health Organisation. It is the
government's objective that these air quality targets should be
realised throughout the UK by the year 2005. Local authorities are
being given new powers and duties to establish plans for delivering the
targets.

Air quality management areas: a new framework for local air quality
management will be introduced that places powers and obligations on
local authorities to deal with areas that do not meet air quality
standards (air quality management areas).

Effective control of vehicle emissions: better air quality depends
above all on improvements to the transport sector. The five main themes
of the approach to this problem are:

* new standards for technology, emissions and fuels;

* planning policies and local transport strategies aimed at reducing
the need to travel and encouraging use of less polluting modes of
transport;

* new environmental responsibilities in partnership with public service
and other fleet operators;

* tighter enforcement of emissions regulations, targeting those
vehicles doing most damage to the environment;

* voluntary action and guidance.

Role of local authorities

Dr Tom Crossett (Secretary General, National Society for Clean Air and
Environmental Protection) considered the role of local authorities in
ensuring effective air quality management in light of the Environment
Act 1995.

So far, of the nine pollutants for which standards will be set, details
have been published for benzene, ozone, NOx, SOx and particulates. Of
these, meeting air quality standards for particulates will present the
greatest challenge for local authorities.

The new approach will place responsibilities on local authorities :

* to review air quality and assess against standards and objectives;

* where standards are not being met, the local authority must designate
an air quality management area (AQMA): they must then produce an action
plan proposing how they will tackle the problems in the AQMA;

* the measures at their disposal will include emissions testing
programmes, restricting vehicle access and other traffic management
schemes.

While welcoming the government's initiative, Dr Crossett expressed his
opinion that it was impossible to assess the practicality of the new
approach until the strategy is published, regulations and guidance
begin to emerge and the EU's Ambient Air Quality Assessment and
Management Directive becomes embodied into UK law.

If the policies so far outlined are to be successful in the UK, the
following areas will be important:

* adequate resources;

* the robustness of standards and their application;

* identification of least cost solutions; and

* management of cross boundary and inter-agency issues in pursuit of
cost effectiveness.

Policy options available

Gordon Henderson and Dr Neil Jenkins (Arup Transportation) examined in
detail the possible policy options for improving air quality.

The importance of vehicle speed/flow in determining emission rates is
well understood. In general, traffic conditions around the optimal
speed of 40 70 km/h (25 45 mph) produce the lowest emissions. At speeds
greater than 70 km/h, emissions tend to increase, particularly for
nitrogen oxides. However, the greatest impact occurs below 20 km/h (12
mph), where the highest emissions are normally associated with slow
moving traffic, stop/start conditions and queuing. Reducing emissions
from traffic can therefore be achieved by:

* reducing traffic congestion and promoting free flowing traffic;

* encouraging shorter trip distances; and

* reducing the number of trips.

Although these factors influence emissions, poor air quality actually
occurs in specific locations under certain meteorological conditions,
when local emissions accumulate and persist.

Short-term options to reduce emissions

Fines for highly polluting vehicles: the Environment Act 1995 allows
schemes to be introduced that levy fines on owners of polluting
vehicles. As an example of the success of such schemes, Singapore
ensures a high level of compliance with exhaust emissions by using
mobile police officers and smoke test teams to patrol the roads daily,
fining or prosecuting where necessary.

Temporary road closures and traffic bans: powers to restrict vehicle
access or impose temporary road closures are also included in the
Environment Act 1995. Clearly, care must be taken to ensure that
temporary bans do not simply transfer the problems elsewhere on the
road network.

Traffic management schemes: urban traffic control (UTC) schemes can be
used to smooth the traffic flow, thereby reducing fuel consumption and
emissions.

A recent report cited a study undertaken in Copenhagen in which the
effect of introducing green waves to allow smooth driving at around 40
km/h (25 mph) was modelled. It was estimated that such a scheme would
reduce emissions of CO and HCs by between 25% and 35% during the peak
hour and 20% over the duration of an entire weekday. Peak hour NOx
emissions would be reduced by between 10% and 25%. Although these
emissions benefits are significant, the study highlighted that this
freeing up of congestion could ultimately attract more traffic, thereby
recreating the problem.

Pilot red routes in London (that allow no parking or waiting) have been
shown to reduce the average journey time by around 15%. However, the
potential of such measures to attract more traffic was also
demonstrated by the accompanying increase of around 8% in the vehicle
flow. Despite this, a net emissions reduction was still achieved on the
routes, of between 1% and 17% for the different pollutants.

Although evidence is limited, research on traffic calming seems to show
that the implementation of 30 km/h speed limits and zones incorporating
physical traffic calming measures usually reduces emissions of nitrogen
oxides. The effects of traffic calming on fuel consumption and
emissions of CO, HC and CO2 remain less certain and some research
suggests that emissions of these pollutants are increased. These
results are not entirely surprising as traffic calming reduces traffic
speeds by interrupting the flow of traffic: this induces a greater
degree of acceleration and deceleration, a type of driving associated
with higher emissions. To achieve a general reduction in emissions,
therefore, traffic calming schemes should aim to reduce speeds whilst
also encouraging smooth driving behaviour.

Medium/long-term options to reduce emissions

Increasing attractiveness of alternative modes public transport:
improvements to public transport, either by the introduction of new
systems or improvements to existing systems, can induce modal transfer
and reduce the level of traffic in urban areas. The growth of light
rail schemes is testament to the efforts being made in this area.
However, the evidence so far shows that most of the people using
systems such as the Manchester Metrolink have simply transferred from
existing bus and rail services. Clearly, the effect on air quality will
remain very limited if public transport fails to attract car drivers
out of their vehicles. Further analysis of the Manchester system showed
the importance of parking commuters who had to pay for their parking
space were twice as likely to switch to Metrolink as those who had a
free space.

Guided busways are seen as perhaps a more cost effective alternative to
light rail in certain circumstances. Bus priority measures in general
can reduce congestion and produce substantial changes in bus emissions
(Figure 1).

The benefits of park and ride schemes are as yet unproven. A study of
Nottingham, Maidstone, Norwich and Shrewsbury indicated that park and
ride could prompt additional car trips as well as encouraging drivers
to travel further distances. Oxford has the largest park and ride
system in the UK and, despite its success, the city has experienced a
gradual decline in environmental conditions. A new #18m strategy in the
city, which includes further measures to encourage transfer from cars
to public transport and restrictions on car parking in the central
area, is being implemented.

Increasing attractiveness of alternative modes walking and cycling:
policies which encourage walking and cycling tend to be given a high
priority by most local authorities seeking to develop sustainable
transport policies.

York provides a good example of the potential of pedestrianisation as
an extensive scheme was introduced in 1987, covering more than 30
streets. Outside the city centre, complementary traffic calming schemes
have done much to improve conditions for pedestrians by slowing down
and reducing through traffic.

High quality cycle routes are also important if cycling is to be
encouraged and the #42.5m award to Sustrans to build a national network
of cycle routes is a welcome development. The use of bicycles to
replace short distance trips by cars is especially important because of
the high levels of emissions associated with such trips and the effects
of cold starts.

Car restraint policies parking: parking controls can be applied by
limiting the number of spaces available, the duration permitted, the
type of vehicle allowed and the price charged. The political
sensitivity of parking measures is great and there exist concerns over
the effects of restrictions on the livelihood of city centres. Also,
the impacts of any parking measures are often diluted by the
predominance of private non-residential parking spaces which are
unaffected by policy initiatives.

Theoretical studies indicate that parking charges can be one of the
most effective means of discouraging car use a Transport Research
Laboratory study concluded that doubling parking charges would reduce
the car's share of commuting in the central areas of towns by about
13%. Interestingly, it was noted that this doubling of car parking
charges would have a greater effect in reducing vehicle emissions than
a halving of public transport fares.

Car restraint policies area bans: heavily polluted cities in mainland
Europe often employ area bans in an attempt to reduce the winter air
quality problems. The evidence from cities such as Athens, Madrid and
Milan suggests that area bans can have a dramatic effect on traffic
levels and vehicle emissions within the banned area. Areas on the
periphery of the ban, however, may experience a deterioration in their
environment and unless the ban is very extensive, overall citywide
emissions reductions are likely to be small.

Car restraint policies central area licensing/road pricing: fiscal
measures such as central area licensing/road pricing are designed to
alter the relative costs of alternative transport modes. It follows
from this that if they are to fulfil their objectives, they must be
supported by a comprehensive package of measures including investment
in new and improved public transport systems.

Perhaps the most interesting projections of the impacts of road pricing
have been developed within the London Congestion Research Programme.
This study indicated that imposing a high charge level (#8 all day for
the central cordon; #4 for Inner London) would produce significant
changes in emissions (Figure 2). Further reductions beyond those shown
in Figure 2 would result if the charging measures were accompanied by
investment in public transport infrastructure and service improvements.

The widely publicised system of area licensing employed in Singapore is
estimated to reduce daily air pollution by around 10% with greater
reductions in the morning-peak emissions of around 30%. Potential
problems of area licensing are illustrated by the increased congestion
and pollution on the ring road, outside the central area. The full
benefits of area licensing schemes can only be realised if improvements
to alternative modes of travel are introduced in parallel. It follows
that allocation of road pricing revenue to fund complementary public
transport improvements is very important.

Planning policies: Planning Policy Guidance Note 13 (PPG 13), published
in March 1994, introduced a major change in UK policy with increased
emphasis on the inter- relationship of land use planning and
transportation as a means of:

* reducing the growth in length and number of motorised journeys;

* encouraging alternative means of travel which have less environmental
impact; and hence

* reducing reliance on the private car.

In essence, PPG 13 is intended to encourage car-borne shoppers back to
the city centre by moving employment and retail centres back into urban
and suburban areas. However, as shown by the recent RAC report (last
month's AEA), there is considerable debate over whether such policies
can reduce overall vehicle mileage and address the wider emissions
issues.

The speakers recommended that more practical research be carried out
into options to reduce vehicle emissions to complement the existing
theoretical work. They laid emphasis upon improvements in vehicle
technology as playing a major, if not dominant role, in reducing
traffic-related pollutants in the foreseeable

future. The principal components in the technological approach will be
catalytic converters, particulate traps, improved engine efficiency and
the introduction of cleaner fuels.

Sustainable planning policies must be reinforced by a firm commitment
to facilitate and fund high quality, attractive alternatives to the car
and an acceptance of the need to implement restraint measures
deliberately to discourage car use.

Air pollution information

Joy Thompson (Planning and Environment Department, Westminster City
Council) covered the role of local government in providing information
to the public about air pollution.

The Westminster campaign has targeted two groups: air pollution
sufferers, and polluters. Sufferers need to be informed when air
quality is going to be poor, and drivers need to know about the
condition of their vehicle and how much it is adding to pollution
levels.

Sufferers air quality information strategy: for most people, the
information of greatest use is when air quality is predicted to be poor
along with what action they can take to protect themselves. Rather than
publicise this information in libraries and other public places,
Westminster developed a more focused approach to communicating with
people who suffered during air pollution episodes. A network of key
contact points was established, consisting of schools, pharmacists,
general practitioners and hospital accident and emergency units. A
computerised system is now used whereby pollution warnings are
automatically faxed to the participants in the network when poor air
quality is ongoing or predicted. A telephone help line is also used so
that sufferers have direct access to pollution warnings.

Polluters Westminster's Exhaust Watch: there are two activities
involved in Exhaust Watch:

* the spotter campaign this encourages members of the public to report
vehicles with smoky exhausts. The information is then passed on to the
appropriate authority London Buses, the Public Carriage Office or the
Vehicle Inspectorate;

* roadside testing police stop the vehicle and a test is run on exhaust
emissions. The driver is given a printout of the results, advice on
what to do to solve any problems, and an information pack.

The problems of how information is communicated are being addressed by
an EU project, Efficiency of Information Campaigns in European
Municipalities which is looking at how air quality information is given
in different European cities, including Paris, Athens, Barcelona and
Westminster.

PUZZLING BUDGET

The recent fuel duty changes made in the UK budget leave some glaring
inconsistencies with regard to the treatment of diesel fuels.

The good news was that environmental considerations were used to
justify the reduction of duty on natural gas and liquefied petroleum
gas and the raising of duty on super unleaded fuel. Further, as part of
the programme to stabilise CO2 emissions, duties on transport fuels
continue to be increased by 5% above the rate of inflation.

Against this backdrop of environmentally-based fuel duties, the
treatment of diesel fuel appears rather incongruous. It is true that
the environmental problems of particulates from diesel fuel per se have
not been conclusively proven yet. With the jury still out it is perhaps
understandable that the Chancellor did not bend to pressure to increase
the duty on diesel fuel above that on petrol.

However, what is less comprehensible is why no differential was
introduced between conventional diesel fuel and low sulphur city diesel
emissions are reduced by 40%. Sainsbury's currently subsidises its
sales of city diesel so that it costs only 2p per litre more than
standard diesel. However, the growth of clean diesel should not rest on
a supermarket's public relations policy and if clean fuels really are
to be encouraged, duties must be reduced. If it is good enough for
petrol, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas then why not diesel?

SOAP STORY

The story of GM's polluting Cadillacs (NEWS ANALYSIS) reads like an
episode of a soap opera, complete with neatly highlighted moral
message.

To begin with, let us examine the polluting nature of these vehicles.
Routine testing found that the engines emitted up to three times the
permitted level of carbon monoxide with climate control on. In simple,
moral terms this can be seen as: in trying so hard to meet the
temperature and comfort requirements of those inside the vehicle, GM
failed to care adequately for those on the outside.

So, with the transgression discovered and the villain of the piece
cast, it was time for a tidy demonstration of the polluter pays
principle. These are troubled times for the EPA and one can almost hear
them rubbing their hands with glee at this straightforward
environmental wrongdoing. Not only must GM pay a fine, recall and refit
the sub-standard vehicles sold, but they must do good and spend another
$9m repairing the damage.

As the sun sets on the story, General Motors is continuing to growl and
splutter that they have been unfairly cast as environmental criminals.
Certainly, the tale seems too simple and in the final stages, the EPA
did appear to abandon negotiation and use the case as a public platform
on which to flex their muscles. This decision may yet backfire if the
net result is that the relationship between car manufacturers and the
EPA has been further tarnished.

ND CA JUDGE APPROVES
SETTLEMENT OF CHRYSLER
MINIVAN CLASS ACTION

     U.S. District Judge Charles A. Legge of the Northern District
of California approved on Nov. 30 the proposed settlement of class
actions involving allegedly defective rear-door latches on Chrysler
Corp. minivans.  The judge held that the settlement was fair,
reasonable and adequate under the law.  Objectors, including seven
individual plaintiffs and the Center for Auto Safety, had called
the agreement a "sham" and will appeal the decision.  Hanlon et al.
v. Chrysler Corp., No. C-95-2010-CAL (ND CA); see Automotive LR,
Dec. 5, 1995.

     The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
investigated the alleged propensity of the latches to spring open
during accidents.  While maintaining that no defect existed,
Chrysler agreed in April 1995 to replace the latches on the
4.5 million 1984-1995 minivans in use.

     In June 1995, Chrysler and the plaintiffs in six state class
actions and the California federal case agreed to a settlement
under which Chrysler would make the replacements and spend
$14 million on incentives and an owner-awareness campaign to boost
the response rate if less than 60% of the minivans are repaired
within 18 months.  Plaintiff attorneys will receive $5 million in
fees.

     Additionally, Chrysler will be released from "any and all
claims for consumer damages or equitable relief, arising out of or
related to minivan rear liftgate latches."  Owners would only be
permitted to take legal action for personal injury or wrongful
death.

     In approving the agreement, Judge Legge noted the main
argument made by the Center for Auto Safety -- that the class isn't
getting anything more than what Chrysler already agreed to when it
promised to replace the latches.  "I don't think that's really
fully accurate," the judge held.  "Chrysler had no contractual deal
with NHTSA...now Chrysler has a contractual obligation.  It's going
to have an enforceable judgment against it (and) is going to be
engaged in an outreach program, as I call it. And the speed...is
particularly important here.  I think that in whatever role I may
have in this settlement later, the thing I'm going to keep an eye
on mostly is the speed with which this process gets put forth.

     "I think it's also true that these class actions -- and by
'these class actions' I mean the state actions that ultimately
resulted in the coming together under the tent of this case of a
federal class action -- a least in part, and I think in substantial
part, forced Chrysler into the action it took, and forced Chrysler
into its dealings with NHTSA."

     Judge Legge said, "Even though I accept what some of the
objectors are saying could be done or might be done, that isn't the
deal before me; that isn't my issue.  I have no power to
renegotiate it, don't want to renegotiate it, even if I had the
power, and I think that what is on the table is fair, reasonable
and adequate."

     Should the settlement not go forward, the judge said, state
and federal courts would be confronted with a multitude of separate
suits.  "They could come down with all sorts of balkanized
decisions, at a terrible time and terrible expense, all to what
objective?," Judge Legge held.  "I suppose the objective is that a
few people would get a little more money, but I think that's all
that would be accomplished."

     As to the $5 million in proposed fees for the plaintiff
attorneys, the judge noted that the work done in the state class
actions helped push Chrysler into the agreement.  "Since the
attorneys' work did produce a result, and since there is no adverse
impact to the class on the award of fees, and since the amount of
fees has been agreed to by both sides, and since the amount was
conducted in arm's-length negotiations under the supervision of
(the court), I don't see any reason to substitute my personal
values or personal opinions on what has been done...I think it's
within the realm of reason."

     Class plaintiffs are represented by Richard J. Heimann,
Michael F. Ram and Anthony K. Lee of Crowley, Marks & Douglas in
Houston and Richard Alexander of San Jose, CA.  Chrysler is
represented by Charles A. Newman and Roman P. Wuller of Thompson &
Mitchell in St. Louis; and by Micki S. Singer and Kevin J. Dunne of
Sedgwick, Detert, Moran & Arnold in San Francisco.

     The objectors are represented by Colette G. Mattzie and
Cornish F. Hitchcock of Public Citizen Litigation Group in
Washington, DC; Robert Graham of the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington; John R. Gerstein of Ross, Dixon & Masback in
Washington; Michael Rubin of Altshuler & Berzon in San Francisco;

11TH CIR. MOVES CASE
FROM WHAT SUZUKI CALLS
ATTORNEY 'HOME' DISTRICT

     In a one-page order Oct. 19, the Eleventh Circuit U.S. Court
of Appeals ordered that a Suzuki Samurai stability case be
transferred from the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
Georgia, in Columbus, to the Southern District court in Brunswick.
Suzuki had argued that no connection existed between the litigation
and Columbus, with the exception that plaintiff attorneys were
based in that city.  In re Suzuki Motor Corp., No. 95-9215 (11th
Cir.).

     The case involves a 1991 collision between a Samurai and
another vehicle, after which the Samurai skidded off the road and
rolled over.  The driver, James Heath, suffered paralyzing
injuries.  His passenger Monica Guinn was killed.  The Guinn family
filed suit in the Brunswick federal court and eventually agreed to
a settlement.  The Heath case was filed in Columbus (Heath v.
Suzuki Motor Corp., No. 4:94-cv-141).

     Suzuki appealed to the 11th Circuit after three unexplained
refusals of the Columbus judge to transfer.  The company argued
that the only connection between the case and Columbus was that the
offices of plaintiff's attorney, James E. Butler, Jr. of Butler,
Wooten, Overby, Cheeley, Pearson & Fryhofer, are located there, and
that the firm is "well-known in the community."

     The defendant noted that the Guinn-Suzuki settlement was not
as favorable to the plaintiffs as Butler has stated, and argued
that Heath might have filed suit in Columbus to avoid a less
favorable forum in Brunswick.

     Suzuki also noted that many witnesses live closer to Brunswick
than to Columbus, with some located in northern Florida where they
could not be subpoenaed unless venue were changed to Brunswick,
which is within the out-of-state subpoena limit of 100 miles.

     In response, Butler claimed, "Suzuki wishes to escape from a
judge who has invested much time and effort in this products
liability action and who has, therefore, become wquite familiar
with the issues."  In a supplemental response to the petition,
Butler said Heath was not forum-shopping and that Suzuki was merely
seeking a delay.

MICHIGAN JURY FINDS NO
DEFECT IN THREE-WHEEL ATV

     A Michigan federal court jury returned a unanimous verdict for
Honda Motor Co. defendants Dec. 7, finding that a 1985 Honda ATC-
125M three-wheel all-terrain vehicle was not defective.  The jury
also found that the Honda defendants were not negligent with
respect to the design and marketing of the ATV or the warnings that
accompanied the vehicle.  Carwile v. Honda Research & Development
Co.. Ltd. et al., (ED MI).
               The accident occurred in April 1991 on a sandy trail near
Jensen Beach, FL.  Plaintiff Manford Carwile, who was not wearing
a helmet, careened into a tree after entering an S-curve and
suffered a severe closed head injury.

     Plaintiff claimed that design defects made it difficult to
turn the ATV, and also alleged that Honda failed to adequately warn
about the risks of operating the vehicles.  Honda countered that
Carwile's accident was caused by excessive speed, inattention, and
inadequate vehicle maintenance.

     Expert witnesses for the plaintiff were engineer David
Renfroe; Edward Karnes on the adequacy of warnings; Werner Spitz,
M.D., on toxicology and helmet injury-prevention; Gary Lustgarden,
M.D., a neurosurgeon; Robert Ancell, a vocational rehabilitation
expert; Eric Amberg, a neuropsychologist; and economist Michael
Thompson.

     Honda called Kevin Breen, an expert on vehicle design,
accident reconstruction and off-road vehicle riding; Harry H. Hurt,
Jr., on the design and protection offered by motorcycle helmets;
and Dr. Philip Haber, on vocational rehabilitation.  Honda also
called Masayuka Tanaka, an employee of Honda R&D Co., Ltd., to
discuss ATV development and design, and Edward Glynn, an employee
of American Honda Motor Co., to discuss Honda's ATV safety efforts
and the Consumer Product Safety Commission investigation of the
vehicles.

     Honda was represented by Robert K. Miller, Larry C. Mann, and
Timothy J. Mattson of Bowman and Brooke in Minneapolis and Detroit.
Carwile was represented by Steven Leuchtman and Frank Mafrice of
Sommers, Schwartz, Silver & Schwartz in Detroit.

ALABAMA JURY AWARDS
$120,000 ON DEFECTIVE
SUZUKI FOUR-WHEEL ATV

     An Alabama state court jury awarded $200,000 in damages to
plaintiff Bobby G. Norman, who claimed that a defective throttle
cable in his Suzuki four-wheel all-terrain vehicle led to a loss-
of-control accident in which he suffered serious injuries.  Norman
v. Longshore Cycle Center et al., No. CV-93-56 (AL Cir. Ct.,
Lauderdale Cty.).

     Norman bought the ATV from co-defendant Longshore Cycle
Center.  When riding away from a neighbor's house, he turned the
handlebars of the ATV as far to the right as he could, at which
point the throttle went wide open and the vehicle flew over an em-
bankment.

     The plaintiff went airborne, coming to rest after hitting a
tree and having the ATV flip over with him underneath.  He
sustained numerous cuts and abrasions on his arms and legs, and
tore his right shoulder rotator cuff.  The treating orthopedic
surgeon gave him a 50-50 chance that surgery could alleviate his
condition.

     At the time of the accident, the ATV had only 50 miles of use.
Norman's expert witness, Michael Burleson of Tyler, TX, tested
exemplar throttle cables manufactured by Suzuki, Honda, Kawasaki
and Yamaha to determine how much force was needed to cause a
separation.  All of the other brands not only out-performed the
Suzuki cable, but were more substantial in appearance.

     The defendants argued that the accident was caused by operator
error and because Norman failed to take the offered free safety
course.   Their expert witness, Kris Kubly of Madison, WI, tested
the exemplar throttle cables and the actual cable involved in the
accident and found no possibility of malfunction as claimed by the
plaintiff.

     Norman was represented by Debra H. Coble and Frank B. Potts of
Potts & Young in Florence, AL.  Longshore Cycle Center was
represented by Danny D. Henderson of Huntsville, AL.  Suzuki weas
represented by John Bergquist of Parsons, Lee & Juliano in
Birmingham, AL.

PLAINTIFF TELLS 4TH CIR.
THAT ADMITTED DEFECT IS
AN UNREASONABLE DANGER

     In oral argument Dec. 8 before a panel of the Fourth Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals, attorneys for appellant Donna Vaughn
contended that errors by the trial judge led to a jury verdict for
Nissan Motor Corp. USA on a claim that a defective voltage
regulator caused battery acid to vaporize and injure Vaughn's lungs
and vocal cords.  Vaughn v. Nissan Motor Corp. USA, No. 95-1086
(4th Cir.); see Automotive LR, Dec. 6, 1994.

     Vaughn claimed that her injuries occurred when the voltage
regulator on her 1989 Nissan Pulsar failed in May 1991.  The South
Carolina federal court jury rejected her claims of strict liability
and breach of warranty.

     On appeal, Vaughn argued that the trial judge erred:

--      in not finding that the defect in the regulator, which
Nissan did not contest, rendered the vehicle unreasonably
dangerous;

--      in requiring a showing that Vaughn was an "ordinary
consumer" when she had a substantial history of treatment for
physical and mental ailments;

--      in rejecting the testimony of four board-certified
physicians that her vocal cord dysfunction was caused by the toxic
battery fumes.  The court compounded the error by allowing Nissan
to present expert testimony that the dysfunction was psychosomatic
in origin, Vaughn claims.

     Nissan responded that the jury credited its evidence that the
defect in the regulator and the resulting vaporization of the
battery acid did not create a level of toxicity sufficient to make
the car unreasonably dangerous.  The jury was instructed properly
that the correct analysis was whether the vapor would have been
unreasonably dangerous for a normal consumer and not for someone
who was peculiarly sensitive to the vapors, Nissan argued.

     The automaker also said the judge ruled properly on
admissibility of expert testimony because no tests or scientific
literature supported their theory of a causal link between exposure
to toxic fumes and vocal cord dysfunction.  Nissan compared this
with the "wealth of documentation" supporting the defense expert's
theory that the dysfunction is almost certainly psychosomatic in
those with Vaughn's medical and psychiatric history.

REPAIR SHOP WINS VERDICT
IN CA NEGLIGENCE CASE

     A California state court jury Nov. 16 returned an 11-1 verdict
for a repair shop charged with negligence when a wheel came off
plaintiff Linda Martin's vehicle shortly after a brake job.  The
defendant claimed that Martin hit an object in the road or a bridge
abutment before the wheel came off.  Martin v. General Auto Repair,
No. 715352 (CA Super. Ct., Orange Cty.).

     Martin took her 1988 Mitsubishi Mirage to General Auto Repair
on Oct. 31, 1992 for rear brake work.  Two days later, the vehicle
spun out of control and hit the bridge abutment.  The left rear
wheel came off sometime during the sequence and was found at the
scene.

     Martin suffered neck, back and shoulder injuries requiring
physical therapy, and emotional distress requiring psychotherapy.
She sought $100,000 claiming $38,000 in past medical expenses and
lost earnings.  Expert witnesses for the plaintiff included
mechanical engineer Martin J. Siegel of Los Angeles and Gilbert
Varela, M.D., of Alhambra, CA.

     General countered that the wheel had come off in an initial
impact with an object or the abutment, and not because of a faulty
repair.  Experts for the defense were mechanical engineer Roger
Clark of Santa Fe Springs, CA and orthopedic surgeon Stephen P.
Kay, M.D., of Century City, CA.

     The jury deliberated for less than two hours before returning
the verdict.

     General Auto Repair was represented by Charles W. Jenkins of
Belofsky & Jenkins in Torrance, CA.  Martin was represented by
Ronald Cher of the Joseph Shalant Law Offices in Los Angeles.

B.F. GOODRICH PETITIONS
CA HIGH COURT ON IMPROPER
SERVICE OF SUMMONS

     In a petition for review filed Dec. 11 with the California
Supreme Court, B.F. Goodrich Co. contends that it was not properly
served with a summons in an exploding-tire case, and that the trial
court disregarded long-standing case authority in adopting the
"substantial compliance rule" and refusing to quash.  B.F. Goodrich
Co. v. CA Super. Ct., Monterey Cty., No. S050529 (CA Sup. Ct.).

     Goodrich says plaintiff Joseph Dinner has conceded that
service was improper in that:

--      Goodrich was not named in the complaint or by amendment;

--      there was no notice pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure Section 412.30;

--      if service was attempted, no designation was made;

--      the summons fails to identify on behalf of whom the person
who received the summons was served;

--      no date of delivery was noted;

--      the summons failed to indicate the name and capacity of the
person who allegedly received service.

     Dinner claims he was injured when a Goodrich tire while being
inflated at gas station.  He then served what Goodrich calls an
"admittedly defective summons" and complaint on "The B.F. Goodrich
Company," not the named defendant "B.F. Goodrich."

     The Monterey County Superior Court judge refused to quash and
the state appeals court denied review.  In its petition to the
California Supreme Court, Goodrich argues, "As the law is clear
that 'the substantial compliance rule' does not apply where the
summons fails to identify the individual being served on behalf of
a corporation, the trial court's ruling exceeded its jurisdiction.
Therefore, based on the evidence before it, the Superior Court
abused its discretion in denying petitioner's motion to quash."

     Goodrich also argues that with the advent of "fast-track"
rules, courts must guard against any tendency to "move the case
along" at the expense of a potential defendant's rights.  "We
cannot trade these rights for expediency, no matter how noble the
cause may be," the petition states.  "The impact of fast track
rules on trial court rulings (such as here) cannot be minimized.
This case presents clear issues of first impression concerning
adequate service, defective pleading and service, and the effect of
fast track rules on the trial court's interest in moving cases to
trial within the fast track limitation framework even against
entities that are not proper parties."

     Goodrich is represented by David B. Paynter, Paul Ellis Baron
and Valerie L. Leatherwood of Lewis, D'Amato, Brisbois & Brisgard
in San Francisco.

CITING INSUFFICIENT EXPERT
TESTIMONY, WD VA JUDGE
DISMISSES LIFT GATE SUIT

     U.S. Senior District Judge Glen M. Williams of the Western
District of Virginia granted summary judgment Nov. 21 to Ryder
Truck Rental Inc. and Maxon Industries Inc. in a suit involving an
allegedly defective truck lift gate.  The judge found insufficient
expert evidence on applicable industry and safety standards,
consumer expectations and causation.  Lemons v. Ryder Truck Rental
Inc. et al., No. 93-0055 (WD VA).

     Plaintiff Kenneth Lemons was injured on the job while
unloading a truck rented from Ryder and equipped with a Maxon lift
gate.  The lift gate involved in the accident could not be located.
Lemons' claimed that gate folded and collapsed.  His engineering
expert testified that chains intended to support the gate were not
properly attached to the end of the lift gate platform.

     Judge Williams found the testimony contradictory on whether
there are industry standards for lift gates, citing the expert's
own admission that many different designs exist, and noting that
Maxon lift gates were identically designed with the same purported
defect as some competing products.

     The judge said the expert's testimony on safety in the absence
of an industry standard was insufficient.  For example, comparative
test results were offered without evidence about similarities in
the weight of the plates, nature of the hinge and distance between
the platform edge and attachment point of the support chains.

     Nor did the expert establish that the Maxon lift gate violated
reasonable consumer expectations, the opinion states, having
presented no evidence of noncompliance with actual industry
practices, no knowledge by the defendants of other injuries or
dangers, no published literature and no direct evidence of actual
consumer expectations.

     Judge Williams said Lemons failed to demonstrate that the lift
gate was in the same condition at the time of the accident as it
was when it left either Maxon's or Ryder's control.  The judge
noted that Lemons' employer had previously modified lift gates on
various trucks rented from Ryder.

               Finally, the court found no evidence that the expert's
proffered alternative design was technically feasible and
desirable.  Judge Williams also questioned the expert's
professional credentials but did not exclude his testimony because
the defendants failed to make an exclusion motion.

     Lemons was represented by D. Jeffrey Coale of Abingdon, VA.
Ryder and Maxon were represented by James R. Austin of Roanoke, VA;
Melissa W. Robinson of Roanoke and John E. Kieffer of Bristol, VA.

AirSensors, U. of CA to Develop Fuel Injector System for CNG and LPG

AirSensors' (Cerritos, Calif.) wholly-owned subsidiary, IMPCO
Technologies, has teamed up with the University of California,
Irvine (UCI) to develop a precision machined valve array injector to
be used for CNG and LPG (liquid petroleum gas) automotive
applications.

AirSensors has contributed $25,000 to the UCI engineering department
to get the research program kicked off.  Additional funding will
come from the federal TRP-Technology Reinvestment Program and grants
from the state of California that subsidize interaction with the
alternative fuel industry.

The principal investigators for AirSensors are Edward Tate and Dr.
Mo Kebaili.  UCI will utilize the talents of professors Dr. Leonard
Ferrari, who is an expert on digital signal processing and computer
graphics; Dr. Richard Nelson, who is an expert on solid state
physics and semiconductor processors and Dr.  John Larue, who has
expertise in turbulence, fluid mechanics and heat transfer.

For further information, contact Andrea Van Leeuwen of Carl Thompson
Associates at 303/494-5472 or Dale Rasmussen of AirSensors at
206/575-1594.

5,000 Mile Sojourn by Propane Pick-Up Tests Refueling Infrastructure

Saying he would "rather import natural gas from Texas and propane
from Louisiana than petroleum from Kuwait and gasoline from
Venezuela," former Department of Energy employee Steve McCrea viewed
a trip from Ft. Lauderdale to Ohio in his propane-fueled pickup as a
perfect opportunity to test the infrastructure for alternative
fuels.

In the March issue of BUTANE-PROPANE NEWS, McCrea reports on his
trip, which -- with side-trips to New England and Long Island --
covered 5,292 miles and consumed 178 gallons of propane.  McCrea
reported that 60% of the driving was on propane in the dual-fuel
truck -- accounting for 3026 miles at 17 mpg.

Fuel stops were not always an easy proposition, McCrea says, because
the "National Directory of Propane Refueling Stations" was not
geographically helpful to a stranger in a given region.  Add to that
the fact that many propane dealers close early, making refueling
after 5 p.m. problematic and limiting the use of propane to about
800 miles of driving in 24 hours.

A refueling stop, which included finding the fuel seller, averaged
an hour, McCrea found.  Prices varied, averaging around $1.50 per
gallon, but cost more at campgrounds because owners charge the same
price for motor fuel as for barbecue grill propane.

DOE-provided tax incentives bring conversion costs down, while
sporting an AFV decal brings the average cost of refueling down at
the pump -- to around $1.06 per gallon (in Florida), or about 14
cents less than gasoline, said McCrea.

McCrea's primary goal was to prove a road trip could be taken on
propane, "but hundreds of Canadians already know this," he points
out.  His second objective was to spread the word about DOE's
toll-free AFV Hotline (800/423-1363), which he had emblazoned on the
side of his car.  His third goal was to simply test the
infrastructure.

McCrea strongly suggests that propane directories in the future
should include maps to help find the stations and highway offramp
signs should include "LPG" in addition to gas/diesel.

ExproFuels, ATI Sign Contract for CNG Conversions in Uzbekistan

In March, the Exploration Company announced it had signed a
participation agreement through its ExproFuels Division with the
American Technical Institute (ATI) and the American Engineering Inc.
(AEI) of Memphis, Tenn. to provide technical evaluation, project
management, and assistance for its joint venture with the government
of Uzbekistan.

The Uzbekistan project envisions the total conversion of Uzbekistan's
government fleet of 350,000 vehicles to run on natural gas.  In order
to bring this about, ATI/AEI has signed agreements with agencies of
the Uzbek government to provide CNG conversion and fuel station
equipment, installation and maintenance training, manufacturing
technology, and overall management of the project.

ExproFuels president, Tom Gose, remarked, "This is by far the
largest and most economical project I have seen in this industry to
date.  The Uzbekistan government has the opportunity to save a very
substantial amount per vehicle converted per year due to the wide
price margin between imported gasoline and locally produced natural
gas.

For more information, contact Exprofuels at 210/496-5300.

New Car Sales Up 4.8% in 1995


   According to the association of automotive dealers in Japan,
sales of new cars, excluding light vehicles, rose 4.8%, to 5.15
million units, in 1995.  This was the first time in three years
that the total exceeded 5 million units, supported largely by
steady demand for RVs and imported vehicles.  Passenger cars
accounted for 3.5 million, up 4.2%, thanks to lower prices on
imports and the debut of new models at the Tokyo Motor Show.
Trucks represented 1.6 million, up 6.4%.  While growth in 1996
will trail the 1995 figure, association sources believe sales
will nonetheless increase.

Energy Company Picks ex-GM CEO to Head Board

Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. (ECD), has hired retired chairman
and CEO of General Motors Corporation Robert C. Stempel to chair its
board of directors and direct its management team.  ECD, an 
innovative products company that emphasizes alternative energy 
technologies, announced its decision after a stockholders meeting 
last week.

Stempel, who was senior business and technical advisor to the
outgoing president and CEO, has worked on ECD's joint venture with
GM to produce nickel metal hydride batteries for use in electric 
vehicles.

The project, called the "Ovonic Battery," is managed by Ovonic
Battery Company, Inc., an ECD subsidiary.

"ECD's activities with the Ovonic NiMH battery and photovoltaics fit
perfectly with my personal interests in electric vehicles and
renewable energy sources," Stempel said.

The company's outgoing president and CEO Stanford Ovishinsky said
Stempel's "engineering skills, his ability to work with and motivate
people and his character and integrity make (him) an outstanding 
addition to ECD and its board of directors."

Weld Still Favors Electric Vehicles in Massachusetts

In light of California's recent turnabout on the two percent 
electric vehicle (EV) mandate, Massachusetts Governor William Weld 
and environmental affairs secretary Trudy Coxe last week reaffirmed 
the state's commitment to its zero emission vehicle (ZEV) program.

"We think the California Air Resources staff made the wrong
recommendation," Weld said, "but that decision does not bind
Massachusetts."

Coxe added that ZEVs are alive and well in the state.  "The Clean
Air Act sets standards which we have met by setting good 
requirements for both mobile and stationary sources.  We have 
exercised our rights under the Clean Air Act, passed a Massachusetts 
Clean Air Law, and set the requirements for low and zero emission 
vehicles.  That's that," Coxe said.

Boston Edison Co. has endorsed Weld's unwavering position on the
retention of clean air mandates and support for EV development in
Massachusetts.

"The Governor clearly recognizes that elimination of the clear air
mandates could have multiple negative impacts on Massachusetts,"
said Carl Gustin, Boston Edison senior vice president.  "Without the 
environmental benefits of electric vehicles, business and industries 
in the Commonwealth could face stiffer environmental requirements in 
order for the state to comply with the Clean Air Act."

Backing away from the EV mandates could place a huge obstacle in the
path of plans to manufacture EVs and the components in South Boston,
Gustin pointed out.  He added that the EV industry could create more 
than 3,000 manufacturing jobs in the state.

Groups Blast Wilson for Plan to Change ZEV Policy

California Governor Pete Wilson is taking heat from environmental
groups for a recent move to do away with a law that would require
60,000 automobiles sold statewide to be zero-emissions vehicles 
(ZEV) by the year 2000.

The California Air Resources Board released a proposal last week to
cancel the regulation after an intense campaign by oil and auto
interests to amend the state's ZEV program.  The proposal, which is 
still in outline form, suggests substituting a demonstration of 
3,750 ZEVs just in Sacramento and Los Angeles for a two percent 
statewide mandate, which would put 60,000 ZEVs on the road.

Coalition for Clean Air representative Tim Carmichael said his group
sees "no scientific or technical reason to delay" implementation.
And Melissa Kaznitz, of CALPIRG, accused Wilson of "selling out the 
environment, high-tech business and consumers to support his 
generous patrons in the oil industry."

The two percent figure is intended to be the first step toward a 10
percent requirement for the year 2003.

The proposal leaves the 10 percent figure intact, but environmental
groups worry that without the incremental step, car companies will
not take the 10 percent mandate seriously.  "From zero to 10 percent 
is a giant leap," said Jamie Phillips of the Planning and 
Conservation League.  "It requires a leap of faith in the car 
companies, in whom we have little faith."

Project Puts Waste Oil to Work

A project at the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT)  recently
uncovered a way to produce hydrogen using waste motor oil and steam,
a development that could radically change the hydrogen fuel cell 
industry.

IGT researchers employed the steam-and-waste-oil process to produce
a sulfur-tolerant catalyst that produces hydrogen.  The procedure
has been used successfully in the past with liquid feed stocks like 
jet fuel, diesel and coal liquids, but the abundance and minimal 
cost of waste oil makes this latest accomplishment particularly 
attractive.

The researchers still got 100 percent conversion of the oil even
when trace metal contaminants were present, meaning waste oil would
not need to be cleaned before use.

The results are good news for the environment as well.  Currently,
only about 30 to 40 percent of used oil is recycled; the rest is
burned or thrown away.  The new process could potentially covert all 
the unrecycled oil into useable, clean-burning hydrogen.  For 
information, call IGT at 708/768-0500.

NGVS TOUTED AS SOLUTION TO FOREIGN OIL DEPENDENCE .

A report
from the National Defense Council Foundation (NDCF) claims that increased use
of domestic natural gas for transportation is a viable alternative to what the
Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) calls "America's increasing dependence on
foreign oil." The study, Natural Gas Vehicles: Helping Ensure America's Energy
Security, predicts that efforts to place two million NGVs on U.S. roads would
create tens of thousands of new jobs and save billions of dollars in fuel costs
for the United States. Additionally, the study forecasts such an effort would
reduce America's balance of trade by $7.3 billion and U.S. oil imports by at
least 2.2%.  The report cites government projections indicating that nearly 75%
of U.S. oil consumption will be foreign-sourced by the year 2010. Furthermore,
study authors project the unthinkable   that the U.S. Department of Defense may
eventually be forced into using foreign oil. "Should this occur, U.S. forces
would be left hostage to the good will of foreign suppliers for one of their
most essential military supplies." "The findings of this report clearly
demonstrate the merits of incentive-oriented government initiatives to advance
the use of natural gas and natural gas vehicles," says NGVC chairman Warren
Mitchell.  National Defense Council Foundation, 1220 King St., Alexandria, Va.,

AFVS MAKING INROADS IN ATLANTA FLEETS .

Advocates of alternative fuels should be
pleased with a recently released, federally-sponsored survey of Atlanta, Ga.
fleets, which indicates an increasing interest in ethanol, methanol, natural
gas, propane, and electricity.  Nine percent of local government fleets in 1994
included vehicles powered by fuels other than gasoline or diesel fuel, while 1%
of private company fleets included alternative-fuel vehicles. Twenty percent of
municipal fleet managers had plans to purchase or convert vehicles to use
alternative fuels during 1995 and 3% of private company fleets reported AFV
plans for the year.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration survey of
102,140 private companies and local government agencies in the city shows that
alternative-fueled vehicles comprised 1% of all fleets, compared to 69% of the
vehicles using gasoline and 30% using diesel fuel. Viewed by fleet ownership,
the fuel distribution ratio shows private fleets consisted of 70% gasoline
vehicles, 29% diesel-fueled vehicles and 1% AFVs, while municipal fleets had
63% of their vehicles running on gasoline, 36% on diesel, and 1% on alternative
fuels.  Private company fleets included an estimated 83,000 conventional fuel
vehicles with light-duty vehicles making up almost 70% of the total. Of nearly
19,000 gasoline and diesel fuel vehicles in municipal fleets, 60% were light-
duty vehicles.  How far fleet vehicles need to travel before refueling was of
interest in this survey because AFVs tend to offer shorter ranges than
conventionally-fueled vehicles, EIA says. One measure of required fleet vehicle
range is average daily mileage. The survey found that one-third of private
fleet vehicles travel less than 100 miles per day.  Also, centrally-fueled
fleets may find it easier to supply alternative fuel on-site. Eight-five
percent of local government fleets with gasoline vehicles and 80% of those with
diesel vehicles fueled them at a central government-owned site. Ten percent of
private fleets with gasoline vehicles and 20% with diesel vehicles fueled them
on-site.  The survey was designed to draw a profile of private and local
government fleets in a major metropolitan area and gauge the effectiveness of
the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which were
expected to boost AFV purchases for use in fleets. The survey site, Atlanta,
was the first metropolitan area designated a "Clean City" by the U.S.
Department of Energy. A second "clean city," Denver, Colo., was the site of a
recently-completed follow-up survey.  Copies of "Profile of Motor Vehicle
Fleets in Atlanta 1994, DOE/EIA-0601," are available from the EIA's National
Energy Information Center, Room 1F-048, Forrestal Bldg., Washington, D.C.

TRANSCOM NGV SYSTEM TO BE USED IN HUNGARY.

TheHungarian government intends to implement a modified version of a natural
gas vehicle electronic control system developed for heavy-duty NGV engines by
Transcom Gas Technologies Pty Ltd. (Herdsman, Australia). Hungary will use its
BKV bus fleet pending a government feasibility study of the process. The World
Bank and the Hungarian Ministry for the Environment's Special Fund are expected
to pay for installation of the system in an initial 300 BKV buses.  Transcom
has applied its fuel-injected natural gas system to a RABA engine that's
scheduled to undergo on-road testing in Hungary. A second RABA engine featuring
the NGV system is being completed for use by Transcom as a showcase in Europe
to demonstrate high-performance levels and low emissions.  The government of
Western Australia has recognized Transcom's technology by awarding a contract
to convert 100 Perth commuter buses to run on compressed natural gas. The $2.2
million ($A3 million) program to retrofit the Renault buses with the Transcom
system follows extensive trials.  Transcom's electronically-controlled,
multipoint NGV fuel-injection system was developed at a cost of $8 million,
with a further $2 million budgeted for this year.

SOTEREM'S HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE UNDERGOES FLEET TESTING IN
FRANCE.

A small
French aerospace firm, Soterem, is participating in a major field test of
electric vehicles being conducted by the French automaker Renault in the
southwestern city of Toulouse.  With an eye toward building fleets of electric
vehicles to be made available as rentals to the public, Renault is currently
testing a dozen EV prototypes, some supplied by local equipment suppliers.
Soterem's electric Vetela is one of these.  The 3-door, 2-passenger Vetela is a
hybrid electric vehicle based on the all-wheel drive Citroen AX. Built under
contract to the French Ministry of Research and Higher Education, Soterem's
developmental Vetela replaces the Citroen's rear axle assembly with an air-
cooled 15 kW AC electric motor; a water-cooled variant will be used in newer
prototypes. Speed reduction gearing and a single-speed transmission transfer
power to the wheels.  Power is supplied by 15 Oldham 12-volt, 36 amp-hour
sealed lead-acid batteries. A front-mounted 1.4-liter internal combustion
engine fueled by a 11.3-gallon gasoline tank also produces electricity to power
the car's electric motor for extended travel, or motivates the car via
conventional IC power only. Electric-only range is a claimed 19 miles, with a
354 mile range provided via hybrid electric propulsion.  Acceleration is
reported to be about average with a 0-60 mph sprint accomplished in 11.4
seconds in hybrid mode. Electric-only acceleration is a sluggish 0-30 mph in 22
seconds. A top speed of 103 mph is claimed.  Importantly, the French
engineering company has achieved its electric hybrid transformation with a very
manageable weight penalty, a claim that can't always be made by electric
vehicle upfitters. The Vetela electric hybrid weighs in at just 440 pounds more
than the standard Citroen AX on which it's based.  Soterem is currently seeking
partnership contracts with local governments and fleets to facilitate building
newer and more advanced prototypes.  Soterem, Z.I. Vic, B.P. 97, 312322

ELECTRIC BICYCLES TOSELL AT AUTO AND BIKE OUTLETS.

With world bicycle ownership totaling over the
one billion mark, it's no wonder that electric vehicle interests are beginning
to show substantial interest in this market. One of these, ZAP Power Systems
(Sebastopol, Calif.), is presently using a $25,000 contract award from the
California Energy Commission's International Energy Fund to stimulate foreign
trade and business opportunities for its electric bicycles. The firm previously
received $20,000 in funding from the National Association of State Development
Agencies and the U.S. Asia Environmental Partnership that reportedly helped
generate $200,000 in revenues. Additional funding from the Electric Power
Research Institute allowed conducting a nationwide electric bicycle
demonstration project through utilities and police departments in the U.S.  ZAP
markets a kit that converts nearly any bicycle into an electric bike. The firm
also sells its PowerBike and PowerTrike models with the ZAP system already
installed. The PowerBike is propelled with dual DC motors mounted over its rear
wheel, a 17 amp-hour, maintenance-free lead-acid battery positioned beneath the
crossbar, and a three-speed controller. Optional are a 33 amp-hour battery, a
headlight, and a speedometer.  A six-amp charger is also provided.  Two other
firms, the Electric Bicycle Company (EBC) and BAT International are also
anticipating a significant worldwide demand for electric bicycles. EBC recently
introduced its EV Warrior line, a five-speed bicycle with a 12-volt battery
pack mounted over the rear wheel. The bicycles retail for $900 to $1500 and are
being sold through automobile dealers.  The firm was formed by Malcolm Currie,
a former chief executive at both Hughes Aircraft and Delco Electronics who also
served as U.S. Undersecretary of Defense, and Malcolm Bricklin, founder of
Subaru of America and Yugo of America.  The company has received $5 million in
funding from an investor in Asia.  Unlike EBC, BAT plans to market its
Electrobike through bicycle stores. The Electrobike uses a direct-drive, geared
transmission and a cartridge battery pack which the company says can be changed
in 30 seconds.

ON THE VALUE OF THE ZEV AS A POLLUTION CONTROL STRATEGY:.

"The zero-
emission vehicle concept represents a breakthrough for air quality protection.
It holds the promise not only of reducing pollution as other vehicles are
replaced, but also would make it possible for continuing population growth to
occur without additional mobile source pollution. For the near term, the zero-
emission vehicle would also make it possible for the relative pollution control
burden on stationary sources to stabilize."   James M.  Strock, Secretary for

MEXICO CITY'S SMOG PLAN CALLED A FAILURE.

A study by Mexico City's
Metropolitan Commission for Pollution Control and Prevention concludes that a
six-year old plan to control pollution has not curbed the city's infamous smog
problems. Key to the plan is a law that bans certain vehicles from the road on
designated days between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m., based on the last digit of the
car's license plate.  According to the study, gasoline consumption in the area
around Mexico City has increased by about a half-million gallons per day over
the past six years. Furthermore, air pollution in the city is said to be at its
worst level.  The problem is said to be exacerbated by the law. To avoid the
rule, some drivers have purchased additional vehicles, driving them when their
primary car cannot be used. To make matters worse, these purchases have
contributed to the 50 percent increase of vehicles on the road since the law
took effect.  Mexico City's environmental commission plans to maintain the rule
until new ones can be passed. Possible plans include incentives for installing
catalytic converters, which currently are not required in Mexico.

GM SETTLES CADILLAC EMISSIONS CASE WITH EPA.

General Motors has agreed to spend about $45
million to settle U.S. Environmental Protection Agency charges that it
installed illegal computer chips that allowed 470,000 Cadillacs made since 1991
to defeat federally-required emissions controls. Those cars now produce up to
three times the legal limit of carbon monoxide.  In settling the case, the
largest ever brought by the Justice Department under the Clean Air Act, GM
agreed to pay an $11 million fine, spend more than $25 million to recall and
retrofit the polluting vehicles, and spend up to $8.75 million on emission-
offset projects such as buying back older vehicles or purchasing new school
buses that burn cleaner fuels.  The case began with an EPA investigation that
showed the Cadillac "defeat devices" resulted in illegal emissions of about
100,000 tons of excess carbon monoxide pollution. The agreement, filed in
federal District Court in Washington, D.C., resolved government allegations
that GM sold vehicles that did not conform to CAA rules, made and sold vehicles
equipped with illegal defeat devices, tampered with certain 1991 and 1992
model-year Cadillacs, and failed to describe the use of emission-control
devices to EPA.  The allegations centered on GM's 1991-1995 model year
Cadillacs, including Seville and Deville models equipped with 4.9-liter
engines. An additional claim involved GM's failure to notify EPA about certain
emission control strategies for light-duty vehicles sold in model years 1991-
1995.  During routine testing in fall 1993, EPA discovered that the Cadillacs
failed to comply with federal emissions requirements. EPA tests showed that the
engines emitted up to 10 grams of CO per mile with the climate control on
well above the 3.4 gram/mile limit. In 1990, GM designed a new engine control
computer chip to respond to customer complaints of stalling and other drive
problems in the 1991 Cadillacs.  The device nearly tripled the output of CO
when the car's heater or air conditioner was turned on. The instructions on the
computer chip enriched the fuel/air ratio, which overrode the emissions control
system and resulted in the higher pollution. For the 1993-1995 models, GM again
failed to disclose the use of the device or its effects on emissions, the
Justice Department said.  "Carbon monoxide can cause cardiopulmonary problems
and can lead to headaches, impaired vision, and a reduced ability to work and
learn," says Attorney General Janet Reno. "These so-called defeat devices are
not just paper violations, but result in real increases in emissions that
affect real people." Adds U.S. EPA Administrator Carol Browner: "These illegal
devices caused enough additional air pollution to blanket a major U.S. city,
such as Washington, D.C., with a 10-foot layer of CO." Because the vehicle
certification program relies on complete and accurate information from
automobile manufacturers, "GM's conduct jeopardized the integrity of the
program," says assistant EPA administrator for air enforcement and compliance
assurance Steven Harman.

U.S. DOE REQUESTS REAUTHORIZATION OF AFV PROGRAM.

A top
U.S. Department of Energy official has formally asked Congress to reauthorize
programs aimed at boosting alternative-fuel use for heavy-duty vehicles.  The
Alternative-Fuels Truck Commercial Application Program, which a House panel is
reviewing for reauthorization under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act
(EPCA), contributes substantial value toward advancement of alternative fuel
transportation technologies necessary to meet EPCA goals, says C. Kyle Simpson,
DOE's associate deputy secretary for Energy Programs. The program's purpose is
to reduce U.S.  reliance on imported oil and lessen the environmental impacts
of energy use in transportation. Simpson addressed the Commerce Committee's
Subcommittee on Energy and Power last month.  The program develops and
implements demonstrations of heavy-duty vehicles using field-test engines
operating on alternative fuels. The goal is to move heavy-duty alternative fuel
engine technology toward commercialization and widen awareness and acceptance
of alternative fuels in heavy-duty applications. In addition, as commercial
technology becomes available, the program will evaluate the performance, cost,
and emissions of AFVs compared to conventional diesel and gasoline vehicles.
Under the program, DOE is cooperating with municipalities, state and local
governments, other federal agencies, and private fleet operators to test the
real-life operation of vehicles running on alternative fuels. The program tests
trucks running on methanol, ethanol, compressed natural gas, biodiesel, and
propane. Because heavy-duty trucks typically are very expensive, the cost of
test vehicles is shared with private fleet owners or state or local
governments.  The program consists of more than 350 alternative-fuel, heavy-
duty vehicles and 40 control vehicles. These vehicles are located in 26 states
and include local delivery trucks, line haul trucks, garbage packers, dump
trucks, snow plows, airport shuttles, street sweepers, and school buses.  John
Nunley, representing the National Association of State Energy Officials,
recommended continued support of Georgia Division of Energy Resources' AFV
program, which uses DOE funds to encourage local governments and authorities to
convert to alternative fuel sources. Investments of $400,000 in public funds
have leveraged over $1.8 million used in converting approximately 350 public
vehicles.

MANAGING CANADA'S EV R&D PROJECTS.

In order to keep Canada's electric
vehicle technology efforts on track, the Electric Vehicle Association of Canada
(EVAC) has launched a program to coordinate this country's pre-competitive EV
research and development projects.  Its aim is to enable Canadian corporations,
governments, and even U.S. and other non-Canadian corporations to pool money
for specific research projects or for development of EV components and systems.
The program is expected to enhance Canada's involvement in EVs in several ways.
Among them: Facilitating pre-competitive research among competing corporations
and helping to create industrial alliances for the joint-venture development of
products that will benefit Canadian and provincial economies.  Increasing
Canada's expertise in EV research and development is also considered a likely
result, as is the creation of spin-off companies with viable marketable
products for the electric vehicle field.  The program is expected to provide
the government with a better structure for selecting programs for matching
funds. The decision on which projects to sponsor will be 100% market-driven,
says Bill Adams, EVAC R&D Committee chairman and president of ESTCO Energy,
Inc. He adds that corporate sponsors must also be willing to fund a minimum of
50% of a project's cost in order to be considered for matching funding from the
government.  EVAC, Suite 11, Concourse Gate, Nepean, Ont. K2F 7S4 Canada; phone

POLLUTANT MAY BE CLEAN FUEL OF THE FUTURE.

German researchers believe
the pollutant carbon dioxide can be retrieved from the atmosphere, recycled
through solar-energy hydrogen into methanol, and become the cheap, clean fuel
of the future. Scientists at Stuttgart's Center for Solar Energy and Hydrogen
Research (ZSW) are confident that their project will be successful.  Not only
is CO2 recyclable, they say, but the process also would reduce air pollution by
shrinking the amount of that greenhouse gas in the air. Furthermore, the
process can be a virtual closed-loop operation: When methanol is burned as a
fuel it releases CO2, which once again can be captured and recycled.  The
process is a chemical reaction with hydrogen gained through solar energy, which
converts CO2 into methanol. By mid-1996 ZSW will have constructed a pump in
Stuttgart to carry out this conversion into methanol. The commercial aspect is
particularly attractive, proponents say. Not only will the fuel be cheap to
produce, but under present German law it will be tax-free, unlike heavily-taxed
gasoline and diesel.

REPAIR AND RECYCLING OF AUTOMOTIVE PLASTICS.

The American Plastics
Council is making available summary research conducted on the repair and reuse
of plastic automotive parts, the economics of recovery and recycling, disposal
practices for post-use automotive plastics, and sorting and processing
automotive plastics. The reports are part of a seven-part series.  Repair and
Reuse of Automotive Plastic Parts concludes that automobile bumpers are the
most repaired component due to strong markets, ease of repair, and availability
of repair techniques. However, many technicians avoid repair of plastic
components because such work is not competitive with the cost of a new part.
The report also notes that the Inter-Industry Council on Automotive Repair and
the Automotive Recyclers Association can play "pivotal" roles in increasing the
quantity of plastic parts recovered and the amount of plastic reused. Disposal
Practices for Post-Use Automotive Plastics outlines current disposal practices
for dismantlers, wreckers, shredders, nonferrous-metal separators, repair
shops, processors, and component suppliers and tracks automotive plastics
through these shops to landfills. The report also finds that polypropylene (PP)
from automotive battery cases is the only automotive plastic component
commercially recycled. After recovery of the lead used in batteries, more than
100 million pounds of PP from battery cases is reclaimed annually.  Economics
of Recovery and Recycling discusses development of an economic model for the
commercial infrastructure required for recovering plastics from the 10 million
vehicles junked annually in the U.S.  Sorting and Processing Automotive
Plastics - Emerging Technologies concludes that creating a U.S. industry which
recycles significant quantities of automotive polymers from scrap vehicles
"will require a tremendous technological effort." Also, the report points out
that new businesses for collection and processing need to be created before
significant recycling of automotive polymers takes place.  Fact sheets are
available free-of-charge from the American Plastics Council, phone 800.243.5790

JAPANESE UTILITY LAUNCHES NGV REFUELING UNIT.

Sanyo Electric Co.
Ltd., a Japanese utility, has announced the production of small natural gas
refueling units for compressed natural gas vehicles (NGVs). The refueling
appliance is capable of filling a 12.5 gallon gaseous fuel tank in less than 2
1/2 hours.  Targeted will be domestic home users and urban transportation
companies. The export market also appeals to Sanyo, which has its eye on
Southeast Asian countries where natural gas is widely available. Sales are
expected to commence imminently.  The Japanese government reportedly plans to
encourage the growth of NGVs on that nation's highways to as many as 200,000

LNG SEEN AS OPTIMAL FOR SOME AIRPORT VEHICLES.

While compressed
natural gas could best meet the needs of smaller vehicles at an airport,
liquefied natural gas (LNG) "would be the fuel of choice for buses and large
vehicles," says Lloyd W. Klefstad, Construction and Maintenance Bureau chief at
Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).  "The Department of Airports wants to
be a good neighbor to our surrounding communities, and one way is to help
reduce emissions in and around [LAX]," adds Klefstad. "LAX is certainly a
leader in incorporating low-emissions vehicles into our fleet." A fleet of 677
vehicles including light-duty trucks, 56 parking-lot shuttle buses, and 17
airfield buses is currently in use at the airport. This creates quite a
potential for integration of alternative fuels into the mix. An average of
65,000 vehicles travel to and from LAX daily.  Several federal and state
legislative and administrative actions affect the operation of these vehicles,
Klefstad points out. In its effort to be responsive to environmental concerns,
the board of airport commissioners is addressing the air-quality problems in
the Los Angeles Basin. After conducting a comprehensive evaluation in 1990 of
alternative fuels for the fleet, the Department of Airports concluded that no
one fuel best meets its requirements.  A year later, based on the department's
research and experience, it was determined that propane or CNG would be best
for buses and large vehicles. However, further study pointed to CNG alone as
best for many of the vehicles.  Following two years of additional
investigations into costs, maintenance, training, facility requirements, air-
quality impacts and safety of CNG and propane vehicles, the department
concluded that LNG would be appropriate for buses and larger vehicles due to
weight considerations and range. For shuttle service the airport uses a
transit-type bus with seating and standing capacity for 40 passengers and their
luggage.  Airfield buses are 130-passenger diesel people-movers.  To date, LAX
has replaced 14 diesel transit buses one-for-one with LNG models and has eight
more on order. The buses have an L10-240G Cummins engine and are outfitted with
a 145-gallon MVE fuel tank and a saturated-type fueling system, providing a
usable 125 gallons of fuel. An initial computerized fleet-maintenance
comparison shows the diesel buses average 3.5 miles per gallon compared to 1.5-
1.8 mpg for the LNG buses, which receive 50-60 gallons of the less expensive
LNG in daily refueling.  As the LNG buses were broken in and operations further
modified, efficiency rose to a fleet average of 1.95 mpg.  Southern California
Gas Co., the fuel provider, selected Cryenco to build the station, which
consists of two 5,300-gallon fuel tanks on skids, plus plumbing and pumps. The
department has issued a solicitation for a permanent station, scheduled to be
in operation within a year. The new station also will fuel CNG vehicles and
other equipment, and serve other agencies, airport tenants, airlines, and the
public.  The department plans to replace its remaining 42 diesel buses and 17
airfield buses with LNG models over the next several years. This year, the
agency will seek bids on six transit buses and a similar number of airfield
buses, with an option for six additional airfield buses.  Meanwhile, the
department is evaluating its other large vehicles as candidates for LNG
variants on a replacement basis and is negotiating to purchase a Class 7 or 8
truck-tractor. Sedans and pickups also are being replaced with CNG vehicles,
and to date 30 pickup trucks and three sedans have been converted to this
gaseous fuel. Beyond that, the department is involved in a hybrid bus project
that will use a constant-speed, LNG-fueled turbine engine driving an electric
generator to power electric traction motors.

FIAT, ROVER TEAM IN VEHICLE RECYCLING.

Agreement Fiat Auto and Rover
Group will collect and treat discarded cars within each manufacturer's
recycling program in Italy and Britain under a cooperative agreement the firms
recently penned.  Fiat's auto-recycling project (F.A.RE) is a closed-loop
recycling system with outlets for reuse determined in advance. The program aims
to create no pollution or waste and use resources optimally via innovative
design and production methods. Fiat says its "design for recycling" assures
maximum recyclability, while its "design for dismantling" reduces the cost of
disassembly and reflects the future-oriented philosophy behind F.A.RE.  F.A.RE
already has spread throughout France and Germany via accords with Renault and
BMW. Launched in 1992 in northern Italy, F.A.RE has expanded to 80 plants
nationwide with 20 more planned by year's end. These facilities are associated
with the National Association of Car Dismantlers.  The plants separate glass,
plastic, and seat padding, which are then collected by other companies
participating in the F.A.RE program. The materials are transformed into new
components for the car market and other industrial sectors. More than 100,000
cars have gone through the recycling process, resulting in about 3,200 tons of
recycled non-metallic materials and more than 69,000 tons of metals since 1992.
Nearly 1,900 tons of glass have helped produce 3 million bottles, while 580
tons of plastic bumper material has reemerged in the form of more than 230,000
air channels for the Tipo and Punto models. Additionally, about 746 tons of
seat padding has contributed to 825,000 square meters of carpeting.

NOx REDUCTION OF ENGINE EXHAUST WITHOUT ADDING REDUCING AGENT DE
4319294 C.

Reduction of NOx in engine exhaust gas involves adsorption of NOx in an
adsorber in the exhaust pipe, periodic desorption with a hot gas and then
reaction to N2 and O2.  The novelty is that the NOx is mixed with the suction
air for reaction in the combustion chamber of the engine.  NOx is adsorbed and
desorbed alternately in two parallel adsorbers. The hot gas from the adsorber
can be used for desorption. For a compression engine with a catalyst in the
exhaust pipe, excess air is used in the adsorption phase and a stoichiometric
mixture for the desorption phase and a small amount of the exhaust gas stream
is passed to the adsorber in the desorption phase, while the rest passes
directly to the catalyst.  USE/ADVANTAGE: NOx is reduced without using added
reducing agent and the entire operation is confined to the engine.

FUEL SUPPLY SYSTEM FOR IC ENGINE NL 191373 B.

System controls the fuel-to-air
mixture of an internal combustion engine which uses several different types of
fuel. It adjusts the mixture according to the relative proportions of different
hydrocarbons in the fuel. The incoming fuel is heated by the vehicle engine's
cooling water. The output pipe from the heat exchanger is monitored by a
temperature sensor.  The refractive index of the heated fuel is then detected
by an opto-electronic transducer. The two sensor outputs are fed to an
electronic controller circuit. A controller output is used to switch the
cooling water flow on or off, so that a preset temperature range is maintained.
Another controller output operates a servo motor. The servo motor controls the
fuel-to-air mixture via a Bowden cable.  USE/ADVANTAGE: Enables a variety of
fuels to be used with the same engine, but without any manual adjustment of the
carburetor.

FUEL INJECTED IC ENGINE METHOD GB 2279994 A .

Each engine combustion chamber is
connected by way of a respective non-return valve to a common pressure
reservoir and a pressure regulator provides gas at a regulated pressure to the
fuel injection system via an outlet pipe. The regulated pressure may be varied
by changing the force of the spring, varying the pressure in the spring
chamber, or by an electrical signal to a regulator electromagnet.  The engine
itself acts as the compressor in that the pressure in the combustion chamber is
supplied to the pressure reservoir through the non-return valves. After the
first few strokes, the pressure reservoir attains peak pressure and after that
volume of gas is consumed it's drawn by the fuel injection system.
USE/ADVANTAGE: Provides convenient and inexpensive supply of compressed gas.
Gas used by fuel injection is contained in a closed circuit, not interfering
with engine idling speed control.
