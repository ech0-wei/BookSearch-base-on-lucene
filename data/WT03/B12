KDD Gets Direct Access to Hongkong Telecom


   KDD <9431> is utilizing Internet KDD, its international
gateway service for the Internet, to create direct lines to
Hongkong Telecom CLS, and has already started the service.  In
service trials, which began in April 1995 and will continue
until April 1996, KDD has set up direct lines with America's MCI
as well as Singapore Telecom.  The new alliance with Hongkong
Telecom CLS is KDD's third gateway.

1994 Orders of Electric Communication Devices


   According to the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, which has compiled data on orders and shipments of
electric communication devices by 38 major domestic makers in
1994, the aggregate total came to 2.6 trillion yen, up 2.7% from
the previous year.  A breakdown by product category reveals that
wired communication equipment dropped 1.6%.  However, wireless
communication devices jumped 14.0%, particularly because of a
38.6% surge in orders and shipments of mobile communication
devices.  Demand by the private sector grew 5.1%.  Exports
declined 10.9%.

THIS WEEK... FCC ON HOLD

     After 2 weeks of being closed down, FCC's backlog of paperwork
is mounting and Jan. 18 agenda meeting may have to be rescheduled. 
Although talks between Administration and Congress were expected to
continue over weekend, there was no indication when govt. shutdown
would end.  Meanwhile, numerous FCC filing deadlines have come and
gone, applications have been held up and stacks of paperwork are
languishing on conference rooms at law firms throughout city.  Once
FCC gets back to work, it undoubtedly will be hit with avalanche of
requests for rescheduled deadlines in dozens of proceedings.

     FCC's Block C PCS auction, which was declared exempt from
furloughs, received high bids totaling $1.2 billion before
recessing Dec. 21 for Christmas holiday.  Auction, which will
resume Jan. 5, started Dec. 18, day shutdown began.  Specialized
Mobile Radio (SMR) auction also continued during first week of
shutdown, then recessed until Jan. 2.  FCC officials said SMR
auction was slowing down and Commission may move to Stage 2 bidding
rules after holiday break.

     Things have been quiet up on Capitol Hill too.  Legislators
went home for holiday without settling budget impasse or completing
action on telecom reform bill.  Although conferees week ago were
ballyhooing agreement on telecom legislation, disagreement among
House Republicans stalled final action and Congress adjourned for
holiday without filing conference report.

BIDDING IN FCC'S 2ND PCS AUCTION AT TWICE PACE OF FIRST ROUND YEAR
AGO

     Long-delayed Block C PCS auction set fast pace with 293
companies seeking 493 licenses through first 4 rounds, easily
eclipsing pace for first round in 1994 when bigger, richer
companies sought 99 licenses.  Auction recessed Dec. 21 for
holidays after Round 4 ended with $1,209,613,496 in net revenue vs.
$678.9 million through same stage in earlier auction.  Although
licenses cover same territory, industry observers suggested smaller
service areas in Block C coupled with repeated delays in launching
sales may be contributing to faster pace.  "There is a lot of
pent-up demand for these licenses," said Kathleen Ham, chief, FCC
Auctions Div.  Auction resumes Jan. 5. (Fri.)

     Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) auction for 1,040 licenses,
more commercial and less glitzy industry, slowed "to a crawl" and
FCC may move to Stage 2 bidding rules after holiday break, Ham told
us.  SMR bidding through 13 rounds ended with $166.9 million in net
revenue from high bids, although Atlanta Trunking's erroneous bid
of $125 million skewed numbers.  Without withdrawal of payment owed
by Atlanta Trunking, net revenue is $60.6 million, FCC said.  Ham
said Stage 2 rules require companies to bid on 75% of eligible
pops, compared with 50% in Stage 1, or face reduction in
eligibility.  Auction staff will review bidding pace after sale
resumes Jan. 2, she said.

     Interest in PCS Block C licenses grew as legal delays pushed
back start from April to summer, then fall and finally to Dec.,
with further one-week delay during first govt. shutdown.  Ham said
pent-up demand combined with 2-week hiatus for holiday probably
contributed to aggressive bidding.  Wireless Bureau Chief Michele
Farquhar said:  "This shows that good things come in small
packages."  Ham said experience acquired in first action also may
contribute to speed of bidding in current sale.

     Block C licenses could generate greater value based on smaller
territories compared with A and B Block licenses, which raised $7
billion from 18 bidders.  Ham said speculation has focused on
revenue possibilities that would increase for smaller licenses. 
Larger A and B territories, such as N.Y. and L.A., covered more
than one state, requiring substantial buildout.  Block C is geared
to Basic Trading Areas (BTAs), with 10 BTA licenses for each MTA.

     Industry analyst Herschel Shosteck offered additional reason
for size of opening round:  Block C companies are vehicles for big
companies to expand existing cellular or PCS holdings, using
ability to hold up to 49% of Block C bidder as minority partner. 
"This is a facade for the big boys to take another crack at it," he
told us.  "It all has to do with ideology."  For example, he said
U.S. AirWaves, headed by former U S West executive John DeFeo, has
backing from MCI, which has loaned company $25 million.  Wireless
entrepreneur Craig McCaw acquired 25% of Personal-Connect
Communications of Seattle.

     To qualify, companies had to have revenues under $125 million
for last 2 years, and assets below $500 million, but Shosteck said
several companies had up-front payments -- in cash -- of more than
$50 million.  AirWaves paid $81 million and NextWave, which is
thought to have Qualcomm as backer, $79 million.  At end of
auction, he said, small companies that bid "will sell out" to
larger companies, leading to news stories on success of
entrepreneurs.

     Analysis of Round 4 bids showed PCS 2000, P.R.-based company,
still would pay premium for its licenses of $11.24 per pop compared
with other leaders bidders' $7.50-$9.  Company also bid $46.5
million ($11.24) in Boston and $46.3 million ($11.24) in
Washington, D.C.  For example, GWI PCS offered $112.5 million for
L.A. ($7.73 per pop) and $48.9 million for San Francisco ($7.59),
DCR PCS offered $70.3 million, $8.58.  NextWave bid $53.1 million,
$9, in Philadelphia, and $37.8 million, $8.03, in Detroit.  In
Block A & B auction, Pacific Telesis bid high of $21.39 in L.A. and
San Francisco, Poka Lambro $1.83 for Wash.-Mont. and Guam.  Most
paid $10-$15.

     PCS 2000 is partnership formed in P.R. as Unicom dominated 3
of 4 rounds, paying premium over competitors.  Unicom Pres. Javier
Lamoso said company was created earlier in 1995 specifically to bid
in Block C auction, raising money by selling shares in $25,000
blocks to unidentified bidders.  Company paid $50 million in
upfront payments to qualify for auction, ranking 4th behind
AirWaves, NextWave, GWI PCS.

     Lamoso wouldn't comment on bidding strategy, and said he was
surprised his per-pop total was well above competitors.  "We look
like bullies," he told us from San Juan.  "I've never felt that
way, even when I was in first grade."  Lamoso said he also worked
for Cellular Communication of P.R. and P.R. Cable Assn.

SEVERAL FCC OPERATIONS CONTINUE IN GOVT. BUDGET SHUTDOWN

     Some FCC staffers remained on job as lack of budget caused 2nd
federal govt. shutdown in 5 weeks.  Unlike last time, when only 95
Commission employees were considered "essential" and remained on
job, mostly those working on World Radio Conference, portions of
many bureaus and FCC operations remained open this time.  They
include Auctions Div. handling sales for specialized mobile radio,
Block C PCS and multipoint distribution service (MDS) licenses. 
Govt. has been shut down for more than 2 weeks and, although talks
were expected over weekend, it wasn't certain whether budget
impasse would be over in time to call workers back to their desks
this week.

     FCC working staff included employees for auctions,
International and Wireless Bureaus, litigation employees in Gen.
Counsel's Office (including Gen. Counsel William Kennard) because
of 2 court arguments scheduled in mid-Dec.  As was case during Nov.
shutdown, commissioners are permitted to work, but their personal
staffs aren't, except with special dispensation.

     Commission employees reported to work Dec. 18, were told to
leave with 3 hours' notice.  FCC hq building at 1919 M St. NW, plus
3 other M St. buildings housing Commission offices, posted shutdown
notices on front doors, plus 2-page memorandum from FCC Managing
Dir. Andrew Fishel explaining situation and spelling out employees'
rights.  He cited "sudden emergency requiring curtailment of the
agency's activities;  therefore, no advance notification [to
employees] is possible." 

     As in last shutdown, comments due during shutdown days can be
delivered first day FCC returns to work after impasse ends,
official said.  Filings associated with auctions will be accepted
in lobby of 1919 M St. and reference room at 2025 M St.;  MDS
reference room at 2033 M St. is open, but only for auction-related
business, Commission said.

TELECOM REFORM BILL WAITS FOR THIS WEEK, AT LEAST

     Congress adjourned Dec. 22 for Christmas holiday without
filing conference committee report on telecom reform legislation. 
Senate Republicans and Democrats said final arrangements had been
worked out.  House Democrats were satisfied with language, pending
final examination.  But House Republicans were split:  Commerce
Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.), urged members to sign conference
report while Telecom Subcommittee Chmn. Fields (R-Tex.), called
legislators from his Houston home to urge them not to sign
conference report.  Rep. Hastert (R-Ill.), member of leadership and
Commerce Committee, said members "will have to make up their own
minds" about which side to take.

     One final factor is House leadership, Rep. Stearns (R-Fla.)
pointed out.  Despite differences between Bliley and Fields, no
bill will be closed out without leadership's approving it, Stearns
said.  At time House adjourned, several Republicans told us they
still had problems with bill.  As Rep. White (R-Wash.) said on
leaving House chamber:  "We're still working on it."  Rep. Oxley
(R-O.) and Rep. Goodlatte (R-Va.), mentioned Internet regulation as
point that should be revisited.  They told us in interviews that
there was no reason that language preventing FCC from regulating
content or prices on Internet should be removed, noting that House
had passed it by large margin.

     Final language agreed to, according to Senate staff, was
little changed from night before, when Commerce Committee Chmn.
Pressler (R-S.D.) said "framework" existed.  Negotiations resulted
in removal of language covering one-year delay in RHC joint
marketing of local and long distance services.  One new phrase was
added to clarify Justice Department's role in determining whether
RHCs should enter long distance.  It said FCC should give DoJ's
opinion "substantial weight," but "such evaluation shall not have
any preclusive effect on any Commission decision..."

     Despite uncertainty on House side, Sen. Hollings (D-S.C.),
senior Commerce Committee Democrat, said:  "There's no question in
my mind that there's agreement.  It's a good bill and it's agreed
upon.  I think ultimately you've got some political atmospheres
poisoned when the Vice President says he's for it and they [House
Republicans] say, 'We're against it.'  Maybe we can get the Vice
President to announce he opposes it."

FCC PROPOSES COMPENSATION POLICY FOR LEC-WIRELESS INTERCONNECTION

     FCC proposed compensation arrangements for LEC-wireless
interconnection at final 1995 meeting that would mandate interim
use of "bill-&-keep" as reimbursement method.  Under bill-&-keep,
each carrier terminates calls for others at no charge. 
Commissioners said bill-&-keep isn't ideal system, but speed is of
essence.  Comr. Quello warned that "search for an economically
perfect system would be the enemy of the economic good."

     Common Carrier Bureau Chief Regina Keeney told commissioners
that interconnection is becoming increasingly important "as the
infrastructure evolves into a network of networks" and agency is
concerned that current FCC policies "aren't enough."  Current rules
require "mutual compensation" but don't set more specific
requirements.  Beauty of bill-&-keep is that it's "administratively
simple," Keeney said, and doesn't require setting up new billing
systems.

     At present, more calls flow from wireless to wireline, meaning
LECs may have to bear more costs under bill-&-keep, but that
situation is changing.  Wireless companies, on other hand, have
complained that LECs are charging them inflated prices for
terminating their calls.  "There's a real danger" that without FCC
action, telephone companies will be able to impede development of
PCS through high prices and delays, Comr. Ness said.

     Although it considers bill-&-keep "preferred" solution,
Commission will seek comments on other options such as setting
uniform rate, charging whatever LECs charge neighboring LECs to
terminate calls, picking up one of various state solutions.  Comr.
Ness said she would be willing to listen if someone came up with
better system, "but it's got to be less regulatory and it's got to
be speedy."

     Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. (CTIA) praised FCC
compensation proposal that it said would result in decreased fees
to wireless customers and increased competition.  CTIA said that
under current practice, wireless providers are required to pay LECs
for terminating calls that originate on mobile phones but LECs
don't pay wireless carriers for terminating their calls.  CTIA
Pres. Thomas Wheeler said that in 1994 wireless carriers paid LECs
more than $800 million to terminate their calls.  "Such a fee can
only act to impede development of wireless as a competitive local
exchange service," he said.

     Commissioners took pains to emphasize that they weren't
stepping on toes of state PUCs.  Fact that FCC has authority to set
compensation arrangements was mentioned several times -- as was
eagerness to keep states in loop.  "We have a good relationship
with the state commissions and we don't want to lose it," Chmn.
Hundt said.  "We want to work with them."  Key issue affecting
state PUCs is how FCC rules will apply to termination of intrastate
traffic.  Commission invited comments on whether it should adopt
interconnection model that isn't binding on state regulatory
commissions or whether it should opt for mandatory model.

     Commission tentatively concluded that information on
LEC-wireless interconnection arrangements should be made public and
will take comments on how to do that -- through tariffing, public
disclosure report or other approach.  Agency will seek comment on
whether new rules should apply to interconnection between LECs and
all commercial mobile radio services or should be limited to
arrangements between LECs and 2-way providers such as PCS, cellular
and specialized mobile radio.  Other option would limit rules to
interconnection between LECs and PCS providers.

     Personal Communications Industry Assn. (PCIA) Vp Mark Golden
called FCC action "an important step for making a right that
existed in the rulebooks happen in the marketplace."  He applauded
Commission for "doing something fast and simple" rather than
following "a long, drawn-out process in search of the perfect." 
Comcast said action "may be the single biggest step the FCC has
taken so far to promote local telephone competition."

INTERNET PATHS CHALLENGE RHCs FOR LONG DISTANCE BUSINESS

     Several months ago, Nynex quietly pulled plug on one of its
little-known experiments, VermontNet, small bulletin board service
that was started to help start reentry into information services
following crash of expensive and complex InfoLook gateway service. 
Reason for ending service, company said, was that Justice Dept.
didn't agree with how VermontNet provided Internet connectivity.

     Even as Nynex withdrew from Internet, however, Ameritech and
Pacific Telesis moved in and are providing Internet access as part
of service to business customers, without DoJ objections. 
Difference, according to officials of each company, is relationship
among RHC, customer and Internet provider.

     New England Telephone (now Nynex-New England) gradually grew
VermontNet from local bulletin board offering local electronic mail
and opportunities for electronic commerce for neighboring
communities to one providing wider Internet access, including
electronic mail and file transfer protocol (FTP) service, crude
precursor to today's World Wide Web.  Internet e-mail alone "was
enough to send it over the edge," Nynex official said.  Nynex
attorneys talked with DoJ and it became clear that providing
Internet access "was not consistent with Justice's view of the
antitrust decree," company said, noting that Justice interpreted
New England's Internet access as indirectly providing forbidden
interexchange service.  Nynex had contracted with 3rd party for
transport to Internet access, but by connecting its service to
Internet service provider, Nynex permitted customers to get service
around world, Nynex official said.  Nothing ever was put in
writing, with opinions from DoJ coming in conversations with Nynex
attorneys.

     In theory, network arrangements between telco and long
distance company are similar to those between telco and Internet. 
In each case, telco sends call to switch of another service, which
then transports it to destination out of local calling area.  But
Nynex officials said key difference wasn't in network but in
economics.  In telephony, subscribers pay telco monthly bill for
local service and pay separate bill to long-distance carrier.  With
VermontNet, subscribers paid flat fee that included Internet
charges that VermontNet paid to Internet service provider to be
hooked into Internet.  "That's where the violation is," Nynex
official said, adding that it was Nynex that recognized there might
be problem, consulted DoJ and then took down service.  Official
said that important factor to consider wasn't whether Nynex
violated MFJ but that under law local telco couldn't be Internet
service provider, which it wants to be.  Also important, he said,
is that law should be changed.

     With other RHCs, MFJ questions have been avoided by
structuring service differently.  Pacific Telesis, not Pacific
Bell, offers entire package of services on server, ranging from
hosting customer information, such as Web site, obtaining domain
name (such as pbi.com), routing customer's Internet access to local
Internet service provider, providing Web browsers such as Netscape
and mail programs such as Eudora for customer local area networks. 
One thing Pacific doesn't do is provide direct link to Internet or
select path for getting there.

     Telesis attorney Keith Epstein said that when customers
contract for Internet services, they're given choice of Internet
provider much as those signing up for regular telephone service are
given choice of long distance carrier.  Telesis calls can't leave
LATA and can provide connection only to Internet.  Epstein said: 
"It's a weird way to provide service.  It's what we need to do."

     Ameritech also entered Internet business through its Advanced
Data Services unit, which isn't part of its regulated telephone
companies.  Ameritech data unit packages range of products and
services, starting with broadband access for businesses, including
hosting of customer Internet data for Web sites, gopher servers or
newsgroups, while providing local high-speed access to Internet,
such as through frame relay or other broadband data services.  As
with Pacific, however, Ameritech stops when it reaches Internet
service provider.  Spokesman Richard Maganini said customers must
choose their own Internet carrier.  As with Pacific, Ameritech also
offers customers help in registering Internet domain names, manages
customers' network and provides single point of contact for
Internet connectivity, while giving client single bill. 
Promotional material for Ameritech's Dedicated Internet Access
Service notes that service is flexible because "Ameritech allows
you to choose your route to the Internet."  But brochure also says: 
"You [customer] will also need to choose a Long Distance Internet
Provider for global access to the Internet."

RESELLERS FIGHT NEW AT&T BILLING POLICY REMOVING ITS NAME FROM
BILLS

     Telecommunications Resellers Assn. (TRA) is meeting with AT&T
in hope of convincing it to reconsider new billing policy for
aggregators and other resellers.  AT&T, which provides end-user
billing and support service for some resellers, wants to reduce its
name identification on those bills.  For example, it would remove
its name and logo from end-user bills and delete AT&T billing,
maintenance and customer service numbers.  AT&T identification
would be replaced by name, logo and numbers of resale carrier. 
Aggregators, which tend to be smaller than many resellers, would be
hardest hit by new policy, TRA said.  They resemble buying groups,
buying AT&T service in bulk and reselling it to end users.

     TRA Gen. Counsel Charles Hunter said talks have produced "some
movement," though not enough to ease Assn.'s concerns.  He said
AT&T has indicated willingness to:  (1) Grandfather use of AT&T's
customer maintenance number for life of existing contracts.  (2)
Permit its logo to be used on joint letters to customers explaining
changes.  (3) Allow aggregators to retain blue border on bills,
indicating similarity to AT&T bills.  (4) Delay start date to June
1 from earlier in spring.

     Nonetheless, "potential for damage is still very substantial,"
Hunter said.  Selling point for resellers is identification with
AT&T, he said, then "all of a sudden, the bill looks different and
the customer doesn't hear AT&T when the phone is answered."  He
said "there is a very real fear of substantial customer attrition,"
with some resellers estimating they could lose upward of 40% of
their customer base.  In addition, AT&T policy change could lead to
additional "back office" costs for resellers that have relied
exclusively on AT&T to provide billing and customer service, Hunter
said, and there could be regulatory changes as well.  Because AT&T
action could change role of aggregators, they may have to obtain
authorization by FCC or states as resale carriers, he said: 
"Depending on which states are involved, this process can take 9 to
12 months or more, at a potential cost of more than $100,000."

     AT&T spokeswoman Karen Way said "confusion to customers" is
reason company wants to take its name off reseller bills.  Several
states, including Fla., have ordered AT&T to change practice
"because of problems with misrepresentation and slamming," she
said.  There's no way of knowing whether customer is slammed by
reseller because AT&T's name, rather than reseller's, continues to
appear on bill, Way said.  Change "brings AT&T's practices in line
with industry practices and state PUC requirements," she said.

     Two AT&T billing services are affected:  (1) Bill Manager
Service, which resellers can buy from AT&T.  Service not only
renders bills, it also provides customer service.  (2)
Multilocation billing, which was designed for use by AT&T corporate
customers that need separate bills sent to various offices. 
Resellers use service to send bills to their end-user customers.

AT&T ABANDONING LECs FOR BILLING, SENDS OWN BILLS DIRECTLY TO
CUSTOMERS

     AT&T returns to consumer billing this month when it begins
sending more than 500,000 long distance customers in Cal., Fla. and
Tex. bills for service, separate from GTE bills that now carry
IXC's charges.  AT&T targeted 3 states and GTE for launch but
eventually will direct-bill all LEC customers, giving company
access to customers, it said.  AT&T said process gives it
opportunity to notify customers of promotions and other special
benefits, while also providing updates on benefit and loyalty
credits.  "We do need to be able to communicate directly with our
customers," said Nancy Smith of AT&T Consumer Service unit.  Before
divestiture, AT&T handled billing for all services.

     Move also allows AT&T to bypass LECs that currently don't
allow IXCs or other carriers to communicate directly with customers
through billing process.  For example, new AT&T bill will include
information on alternate calling plans, True Reward credits for
participants in loyalty program, cost savings based on competing
services.  Official said bill also will give customer long distance
plan options based on calling patterns monitored by company.  For
example, cheaper rates might be available for certain kinds of
service or at certain times of day, and such information would be
reflected on new bill, carrier said.

     AT&T official said new bills being introduced in GTE territory
eventually will appear in other regions, but declined to reveal
timetable or targets for next year.  Ultimately, company plans to
provide service to most of its 80 million residential customers, as
it does for 10 million business customers, official said.  Bills
are printed in Charlotte, N.C., and official said company doesn't
have plans to erect other billing centers.

     GTE officials didn't comment on AT&T plans, which will give
GTE-AT&T customers in 3 states separate bills.  GTE provides
service in Tampa, most of Tex. and substantial portions of Southern
Cal.

     New AT&T bills are larger than many of LECs', which are 4"x7"
and printed on one side of page.  New version is 6-1/2"x10", with
wide margins where service-type information is carried.  First page
includes summary of charges, with section showing savings compared
against AT&T standard rates and points earned in loyalty program.

     LECs said they were aware of AT&T plans.  Ameritech said move
would further confuse customers already bombarded by bills and
messages from utilities, including LEC.  At Nynex, for example,
AT&T recently signed one-year contract to continue using LEC for
billing customers, Nynex spokesman Bob Varettoni said.  "It's a
competitive market.  People can do what they want to do."  He said
Nynex had attractive billing and collection service for other
carriers.  Company declined to elaborate on contract terms with
IXCs.

     Nynex also will unveil new bills this month, beginning with
500,000 customers in Buffalo and reaching all by end of first
quarter, he said.  Bills will include promotional and cost-saving
information, similar to AT&T's, but features won't be extended to
IXCs or other carriers.  He said summary page will spell out costs
clearly for local, interLATA long distance and other long distance
charges along with total for billing period:  "It will be an
attractive package" based on "lot of" customer research.

     Ameritech spokesman said company thought move would add
confusion in residential market.  "Why should they reinvent what
already exists," spokesman said.  Like Nynex, Ameritech provides
billing and collection services as "common carrier" to all
companies, for fee.

CAL. PUC ADOPTS FINAL TELECOM COMPETITION RULES, GIVES OKAY TO 31
ENTRANTS

     Cal. PUC  approved rules to open local telephone loop Jan. 1
and granted certificates to 31 companies that hope to become local
exchange carriers (LECs).  They include broad cross-section of
telecom industry and at least one electric utility.  PUC said rules
are "largely the same" as proposed regulations released in July
that set broader outline for opening markets.  Agency also adopted
3-year freeze on price caps for Pacific Bell (PB) and GTE, and
lowered productivity factor to rate of inflation because
"underlying assumptions and data" that created current 5% factor
are "obsolete."  Commission also granted some increases for 4 small
telcos.

     Companies that won certificates:  Advantage Communications,
Assoc. Group, AT&T Communications, Brooks Fiber (of Bakersfield,
Fresno, Sacramento, San Jose, Stockton), Cable Plus, Century
Telecommunications, Continental Telecommunications, Electric
Lightwave, Fiber Data Systems, GST Lightwave, GST Pacific
Lightwave, GTE-Cal., GTE Intelligent Network Services, ICG Access
Services, Info-Tech Communications, Linkatel Pacific, MCI Metro
Access Transmission Services, MFS Intelenet, NewTelco, Nextlink,
Pacific Bell, Pac-West Telecomm, TCG (of L.A., San Diego, San
Francisco), Viacom Communications, Winstar Wireless.

     New rules set terms for interconnection, interim number
portability (through remote call forwarding) and universal service,
PUC said, and keep "same level of access" for deaf and disabled
residents.  PUC said it will determine cost of remote call
forwarding in separate proceeding early next year.  All telecom
providers will have to provide 911 access, directory databases and
"warm-line service," which allows residents to access emergency
services even if phone has been disconnected for other calls. 
Rules contain provisions to protect against slamming by requiring
written confirmation of each sale, with description of services and
price breakdowns.

     In other actions, PUC:  (1) Granted rate increases to 4 small
telcos -- Calaveras (68.5%), Hornitos (379%), GTE W. Coast (30.6%),
Happy Valley (29.6% for Olinda, and 53.2% for Platina exchange) --
and approved changes in state's high-cost fund, which subsidizes
rural telephone rates.  Portion of increases for Calaveras and
Hornitos will be offset by elimination of suburban mileage charges,
PUC said, covering 80% of boost for Calaveras and 20% for Hornitos. 
Agency reduced to 0.27% from 0.5% amount companies must contribute
to high-cost fund because it has grown since last year while total
draw has decreased 44%.

     (2) Released its report to state legislature on how
competition may affect universal service and proposed that basic
service include 911 access, free customer service, directory
assistance, others.  It also proposed high-cost voucher fund to
subsidize companies in rural areas and said it would lobby
legislature to change existing law to make change possible. 
Voucher system would set credits on customer bills to make sure
they received subsidy regardless of chosen provider, PUC said, and
would base amount of subsidy on cost-rate differential with
incentives to improve efficiency.  It floated idea of competitive
bidding for subsidy and said it would decide issue by June. 
Commission proposed grant programs to hook up libraries and schools
to new telecom services through bill surcharge, taxes on sale of
telecom products, or mandated discounts.  All companies also should
meet same service quality standards, PUC said.

     FCC launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home

     FCC launched proceeding to reduce inconsistencies in home
wiring rules between telcos and cable, saying change is needed
because of convergence of industries.  Action was taken at Dec. 15
agenda meeting.  Rulemaking will deal with demarcation between
customer-owned and company-owned wiring, signal leakage and
quality, technical standards, customer-premises equipment (CPE) and
division of state and federal responsibilities.  Regulation of
cable and telcos should be comparable "where appropriate," FCC
Comr. Ness said, and Commission should deregulate "where it makes
sense."  Comr. Chong said she would have preferred to move
demarcation point immediately, but went along with launching
rulemaking "since we have agreed to move swiftly."  Chmn. Hundt
said owning wiring "can be a tremendous competitive advantage" for
incumbent, and new rules could make cable CPE market as competitive
as telephone equipment market.  Rulemaking seeks comment on:  (1)
What demarcation point would be appropriate, acknowledging it might
be different for single-family and multiple dwelling units.  (2)
Whether telcos' broadband services should have to meet same signal
leakage and signal quality standards as cable.  (3) Whether cable
should have to standardize on jacks to connect CPE to cable system,
as telcos have for telephony.  (4) Whether cable should have same
regulatory distinctions between residential and nonresidential
wiring as telcos.  (5) Whether consumers should have same access to
in-home broadband wiring as they do to telephone wires.  (6) How to
divide regulatory responsibility for wiring among franchise
authorities, states and FCC, and harmonize state and federal
regulation of telephony and video programming.

     FCC Wireless Bureau rejected Radiofone request for delay in
Block C PCS auction, saying company's request for emergency relief
didn't meet test required and would hurt bidders in current
auction.  Order signed by Michele Farquhar, acting chief of Bureau,
said granting stay in fact would cause "irreparable harm to other
parties and would be inconsistent with the public interest." 
Radiofone sought stay Dec. 8 as part of challenge to Commission's
rules barring cellular license holders from seeking 30 MHz PCS
licenses in same region.  Order said Radiofone's argument that
Commission can't apply its rules to restrict ownership is
insufficient to overturn rulemaking developed last year.  "It is
very unlikely that the Commission would... reexamine the merits of
the 45 MHz spectrum cap, which was adopted a little over a year ago
to promote competition, discourage anticompetitive behavior and
create incentives for innovation and efficiency in CMRS [Commercial
Mobile Radio Service], including broadband PCS," order said.  It
also said rule wasn't at issue when 6th U.S. Appeals Court,
Cincinnati, remanded rulemaking to Commission.  Bureau said further
delay in auction, which began Dec. 18, "will cause severe harm to
each of the other C Block applicants."

mobile radio auction (SMR) after intended $125,000 bid became $125
million error.  Company said bid filed electronically carried 3
extra zeros.  In waiver request, it asked Commission to consider
size of company and nature of mistake in granting waiver.  Full
Commission will have to review request at end of auction, lawyer
Diane Law said Thurs.  Under FCC rules, companies that withdraw
bids are liable for penalty based on difference between withdrawn
offer and eventual high bid at end of sale.  Company earlier bid
$1,100 for same license, designated P frequency block;  high bid
before error was about $100,000, submitted by FCI 900 -- which is
Nextel.  Atlanta Trunking resubmitted $125,000 bid in Round 10, FCC
said.  Efforts to contact company, part of Southland Corp. and SMR

brought by Debbra Wright, who charged cellular telephone caused
brain cancer and who accused industry of conspiracy to conceal

linking HES to conspiracy.  He's expected to issue written opinion
this month and rule in March on similar charges Wright filed
against Wireless Technology Research (WTR), which also is headed by
Carlo and set up by industry to study health effects of cellular
phones.  WTR said all allegations should be dismissed because "they
are based on the same key factual issues the judge has now
resolved... WTR believes that lawsuits such as the Wright case are
wasteful attacks on the scientific community, that they slow
completion of the research necessary to answer the public's
questions about the health effects of all wireless technology and
that these tactics could themselves pose threats to public health
if they delay implementation of any interventions that may prove
necessary."

"All we are asking for is the opportunity to pay for our own ads to
tell our side of the story."  Official said station doesn't carry
issue-oriented ads, such as CWA spots.  "It wasn't in response to
the issues that CWA raises," spokeswoman said.  Station and
ABC-owned WPVI, also Philadelphia, rejected all CWA ads focusing on
bargaining with BA, she said.  Company commercials discuss service
options and describe corporate initiatives, don't address labor
discussions.

     RHCs' share of access revenues is likely to decline to 80%

     RHCs' share of access revenues is likely to decline to 80%
from current 97% when local competition begins, putting pressure on
cash flows and causing drop in average credit ratings to A1 from
Aa3, Moody's said.  Revenue growth will slow to 1.4% annually
through 1999 compared with average 2.2% growth for 5 years through
1994, rating agency said.  "Unprecedented challenge" to residential
and business customer base will occur with or without reform
legislation, as state lawmakers and regulators seek to open
markets, said Stephen Gutkowski, vp-senior credit officer. 
Business segment will be first target of competitors, he said, with
residential competition much later.  "It will be a number of years
before any facilities-based alternative can provide a mass-marketed
switched voice service that will have a material impact on the
telephone companies' market share."  RHC revenues also will be hit
by bypass technologies and price cuts charged to IXCs, to 1.5 cents
per min. from current 3 cents, Gutkowski said.  "Moody's believes
the loss of market share in existing lines of business will have

Commerce Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.) about Tauzin's future role
but stopped short of saying deal involved his taking over
chairmanship of Telecom Subcommittee now held by Chmn. Fields
(R-Tex.) who is retiring from Congress.  Rep. Oxley (R-O.) is
current subcommittee vice chmn. and would like to take over
chairmanship.  Technically, speaker doesn't appoint subcommittee
chmn. -- committee members vote on recommendations by chairman of

seniority than Commerce Committee Chmn. Bliley (R-Va.) and wasn't

     U.S. and Mexico will look into allegations by Telephone
Workers Union of Mexico that Sprint closed La Conexion Familiar
subsidiary in San Francisco to harm union, U.S. Dept. of Labor
(DoL) officials said.  Examination will focus on how plant closings
affect union organizing, DoL said.  However, it won't lead to any
penalties because only NLRB has jurisdiction, said Jack Otero,
deputy undersecretary for international affairs.  NLRB judge in
Aug. ruled that San Francisco unit was closed primarily because it
was losing money, although 50 job-related violations were noted. 
Sprint made shutdown decision 8 days before scheduled employee vote
on joining CWA.  Study will be conducted by Labor Secretariat,
organization of U.S., Mexican and Canadian officials set up to
review labor conditions under NAFTA.  CWA and Sprint said case was
unlikely to cause Sprint regulatory problems in Mexico.  Mexican
govt. officials had complained about closing, saying U.S. wasn't

proposes 5 categories:  (1) "Access," covering long distance
connections.  (2) "Basic-Residential" for nonbusiness lines.  (3)
"Basic-Other" for business lines.  (4) Discretionary, covering
optional services such as call waiting and call forwarding.  (5)
Competitive, for services offered by other providers such as
Centrex and speed dialing.  BA said it will cap access and
basic-residential rates for 2 years, basic-other for one year. 
After that, it said, it would adjust services based on Gross
Domestic Product price index minus 1.5%.  Discretionary services
wouldn't rise more than 25% per year, BA said, but competitive
services would be unregulated.  It also said plan would preserve
existing quality-of-service standards.  MCI submitted its own price
cap plan for BA last month that it claimed would shave $72 million
off intrastate toll rates.  However, BA has criticized that
proposal as "rate-of-return in sheep's clothing," saying it
underestimated universal service costs by $47 million.

     Ariz. Corp. Commission (ACC) approved AT&T and MCI

     Ariz. Corp. Commission (ACC) approved AT&T and MCI
applications to provide intraLATA toll service in competition with
incumbent local exchange carriers (LEC).  Sprint application is
pending, ACC said, and others are expected.  ACC also approved
rules to expand universal service fund to increase support to
high-cost rural areas, and implement intraLATA equal access, which
requires LECs to provide one-plus dialing by April 20 so customers
can use entrants services without dialing 5-digit access code. 
Entrants have said that discourages customers from switching from
incumbent carrier.

FCC Clarifies Rules on Use of BNA Information

     The FCC on Feb 1. adopted a third order for reconsideration in
Common Carrier docket no. 91-115 in which it upheld a series of
earlier rulings that require local exchange carriers (LECs) to
provide billing name and address (BNA) information to
telecommunications service providers (TSPs) under tariff. The
Commission also clarified its rules regarding the use and
disclosure of BNA information.  The third reconsideration order is
the latest in a long-running docket proceeding.  

     That docket has produced numerous orders, clarifications, and
reconsiderations stemming from a 1989 petition by Capital Network
Systems, Inc., and the Competitive Telecommunications Association
asking that the FCC require LECs to provide BNA information to long
distance carriers and competitive access providers so that they
could properly bill for their services.  

     This latest order for reconsideration responds to two
petitions from U S WEST Communications, Inc., which it filed in
1993 asking the Commission to reconsider its second report and
order of that year covering the use and disclosure of BNA
information ("BNA order").  The third reconsideration order also
addresses concerns raised by other carriers, including operator
service providers.  

     U S WEST asked the Commission to reconsider again rules that
require LECs to notify customers that their billing information
will be made available to TSPs under certain conditions.  

     The order also set out a series of deadlines for notification,
which generated a series of petitions from LECs and the United
States Telephone Association asking for more time.  In subsequent
orders, the FCC extended the deadlines for those disclosures.  

     All the deadlines have now passed, and like other LECs, U S
WEST has completed its notification process but asked the FCC to
consider that the process was harmful to the carrier.  Throughout
the docket proceeding, the FCC has upheld its original conclusion
that providing BNA information for third-party, calling card, and
collect calls, is "a common carrier service which must be offered
under tariff."

     Petitions for reconsideration by U S WEST and others arguing
against this judgment were repeatedly denied.

     The FCC's third reconsideration order, released Feb. 9,  deals
with issues raised by U S WEST in two separate petitions that the
FCC reconsider its first and second orders for reconsideration.  In
its first petition, U S WEST argued that its First Amendment right
to remain silent was violated by the BNA rules and that it had been
done "irreparable harm" by Commission requirements that it notify
its customers of the status of their billing information.  

     The Commission denied that petition on the grounds that the
carrier had already made that argument in earlier proceedings. 
(The Commission found in 1986 that BNA information falls into a
category of "legal notifications" that are excepted from First
Amendment protection.)  In its second petition, U S WEST claimed
that the FCC had earlier misjudged the carrier's argument on First
Amendment grounds and that in the course of the FCC's orders for
reconsideration U S WEST had been denied due process.  The
Commission found that the carrier's rights to due process had "not
been abridged" by its earlier orders.  

     Further, the Commission ruled that privacy protections that
prohibit disclosure of BNA information on calling card,
third-party, and collect calls apply only when a customer
"affirmatively withholds consent for BNA disclosures."  In its
original BNA orders, the FCC required LECs to notify customers that
their BNA information would be disclosed to TSPs for these types of
calls.  The notification process included an option for customers
to request that such information not be disclosed.  

     The BNA orders also set out rules restricting the use of BNA
information for marketing purposes.  The prohibitions were opposed
by several carriers and operator service providers, such as Oncor,
Inc., that rely on that information for their targeted marketing
activities.  In the third order for reconsideration, the Commission
upheld its earlier finding that direct marketing activities, such
as those that might involve the use of BNA information, can be a
"nuisance" to consumers.  

     The Commission also clarified that the prohibition on usage of
BNA information is applicable to all types of calls, even though
requirements for providing BNA information on a tariff basis apply
only to third-party, calling card, and collect calls.

     Acting on additional U S WEST arguments, the Commission said
BNA information on calls that do not involve calling cards, third
parties, or collect charges could be supplied to TSPs under tariff
or contract "to the extent [that] provision. . .is not prohibited
by our rules." 

     Specifically, the Commission clarified that BNA information
may be provided to interexchange carriers in association with
"10XXX 1+" calls--those in which an alternative long distance
provider is chosen by the customer.  The use of such dialing codes
was not in evidence at the time of the original BNA order, the
commission said, but it found that calls requiring dialing codes
have similar billing requirements to calling card and other toll
calls.  Further, the Commission said LECs are not required to
notify customers of the disclosure of BNA information when dialing
codes are used.

CTIA's Cibernet Adapting to New Wireless Billing Requirements

     As wireless carriers continue to increase their calling
traffic and the diversity of their services both in the U.S. and
abroad, it is becoming increasingly necessary to devise newer,
flexible billing systems to accommodate their needs, according to
Cibernet Corp.'s Dawn M. Brodman, Manager-industry standards, and
Jennifer Nowak, Product Manager-CORD.  Cibernet is a subsidiary of
the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the
standard-setting body for the U.S. wireless industry.  

     The Cibernet subsidiary grew out of the CTIA's Roamer
Committee, which was "commissioned to support network settlement
agreement standards," among wireless carriers, said Ms. Nowak.  In
the mid-1980s that group developed the CIBER (cellular information,
billing, exchange, and roaming) standard, now in use throughout
U.S. cellular networks.  Cibernet was created in 1988 to administer
the CIBER standard and to provide network settlement services to
cellular carriers.

     CIBER is based on CTIA's IS-124 standards for wireless call
data, said Ms. Brodman.  "We dynamically update our standard based
on technology requirements, among other things."  CIBER is a
batch-oriented standard, designed to aggregate information over a
set period of time.  Under the batch system, Ms. Brodman explained,
"There are time provisions [within the transmission protocol] that
automatically kick out a message that is over 30 days old.  But
there may be times when a cellular customer won't see a roaming
bill for 45 to 60 days."  

     Analysts have noted that such delays in bill reporting lead to
needless expenses for the service provider and confusion for the
customer (CBR, Nov. 17, 1995).  The proliferation of personal
communications service (PCS), advanced cellular services, and
international transmission protocols--all of which require more
flexible and responsive billing systems--has led Cibernet to
replace the CIBER standard.

     "Consider CIBER to be our legacy standard," said Ms. Brodman. 
Cibernet has formed working groups to develop two new standards,
one for billing and support functions and another for fraud
detection systems.  "The goal is to get down to a 60-second
turnaround time" between the time a roaming call is made and the
time it is recorded in the service provider's billing system, she
noted, adding, "This isn't real-time billing, but it's close.  We
expect most carriers will still retrieve their billing information
in some kind of batch form."  But, she said, carriers could
retrieve information in batch form several times a day, rather than
weekly or monthly, which is more common now.

CORD Project Aims for Paperless Management

      Another effort to streamline wireless carrier billing
interoperations is the CORD (Cibernet Online Roaming Database)
project.  CORD is an automated, shared database for the exchange
and maintenance of billing information and roaming data among
wireless carriers.  Ms. Nowak told CBR the system is due to be
released this year and that Cibernet expects it to become the
standard platform for interoperator roaming agreements.

     When wireless carriers enter into roaming agreements today,
they must record the details of the agreement on paper and
distribute them to all the parties involved for entry into
proprietary billing systems.  This leads to a lag time between the
conclusion of the agreement and its actual implementation within
the wireless networks, said Ms. Nowak.

     CORD stores the details of roaming agreements worked out
independently between carriers with adjoining cellular coverage
areas.  Parties that have formed a roaming agreement enter relevant
data (e.g., interconnection rates) jointly into the CORD system. 
Only the original carriers, or others that they jointly designate,
have access to the information.  Access is controlled by a system
of user identification profiles and verification procedures,
explained Ms. Nowak.  The carriers are then able to connect their
in-house billing platforms to CORD in order to update vendor tables
and other records used to track calling data.

     In addition, authorized carriers can make modifications to an
agreement at any time. The changes are automatically reflected in
the database and in the systems of all the parties that have access
to the agreement.  Ms. Nowak said this eliminates the need for
system operators repeatedly to "key in" the details of the roaming
agreement (at each vendor location).  

     This reduces the time to market for new services and the risk
of human error in the billing systems.  CORD's database and
communications protocols are based  on the CIBER standard for the
sharing of billing information--a standard already in use by most
the wireless carriers in the U.S. said Ms. Brodman.  When other
standards are adopted, Cibernet will change CORD to accommodate
them, she said.  

     "CORD is not commercially available yet," said Ms. Nowak.  But
she expects it to be released this year after beta testing is
completed.  CORD will be organized as a subscription service,
similar to the network settlement agreement services Cibernet
currently offers.  

     Cibernet maintains itself as an "independent neutral body,"
not only as a back office go-between for CTIA members and clients,
but also in its support of competing technologies.  Both Ms. Nowak
and Ms. Brodman said they expect that the need for an independent
party only will increase as the proliferation of technologies and
wireless companies continues.

MCI, AMEX Offer Consolidated Billing

     In another move to capture shares in the business telephony
market, MCI Telecommunications Corp. announced an agreement with
American Express Travel Management Services, Inc., to consolidate
out-of-office long distance calling charges on American Express
corporate card billing statements.  

     The service works in conjunction with MCI's virtual private
network offering, "V-Net," and American Express corporate card
accounts.  For each call placed from a designated "V-Net" location
(e.g., a home office) to any other "on-net" location, MCI will
transfer call detail records to American Express, which matches the
originating location with the proper credit account--acting
essentially as a rebiller for MCI, according to an MCI spokesman. 
 In addition, long distance calls placed from cellular phones
(pointed to the MCI network) and credit card calls from pay phones
also are billed through AMEX.  

     All calls are priced based on the customer's prearranged VPN
rate, regardless of the originating location, the spokesman said. 
The AMEX bill will include detail reporting such as call duration,
origination, termination, and cost per minute.

Kenan's Arbor B/P To Support Prodigy 

     Kenan Technologies, a unit of Kenan Systems Corp., announced
that online service Prodigy will be the first customer for Arbor/BP
4.0, the latest version of its UNIX-based distributed billing and
customer care platform released last fall (CBR, Nov. 3, 1995). 
According to Kurt Silverman, Kenan Technology Executive
Director-product development, Prodigy's "highly distributed"
network architecture is complimentary to Arbor's client/server
configuration.  Unlike other installations, he said, "We did not
have to customize our platform at all to meet Prodigy's needs." 
Kenan expects to turn on service with Prodigy by March.

     Arbor B/P is a "customer-centric" billing and customer care
system, said Mr. Silverman.  It employs an SQL database and
customizable bill formats allowing bill generation in any language. 
The system also includes an online image server that delivers a
reproduction of billing statements to customer service
representatives.  The images also can be compressed and
transmitted, an application that looks forward to customer access
to bills over the Internet.

     The Prodigy installation does not include functions for
Internet-based billing, said Mr. Silverman, but he said some of its
functions "are not incompatible" with electronic billing
activities.  "Kenan is looking forward to the Internet as the next
platform for electronic transactions," he said.  Possible
applications for Arbor B/P include connecting a retailer's or
service provider's Internet site to clearinghouses for real-time
processing of credit card payments. 

     Kenan has created a developer environment for Arbor that
allows Prodigy and others to create application program interfaces
for customized functions.  Combined with the SQL database, Mr.
Silverman said, Arbor can be "optimized" for specific data queries. 
Prodigy, for example, will be able to identify which users are
using specific services, rather than having transaction data
supplied only on a "volume and number" basis.

Building a Blueprint for Convergence

By Rick Brown

     The recent passage and signing of the new telecommunications
law by President Clinton is expected to accelerate the demand for
convergence billing and customer care capabilities in the telecom
industry, as organizations implement offensive strategies for new
markets to enter, and develop defensive tactics for combating
encroachment on their turf.

     Convergence billing and customer care capabilities help
competitors "brand, bond, and bundle," in the words of one
organization with a major convergence effort under way.  Branding
establishes, or leverages, a single brand name for all of the
services a company offers.  Bonding builds strong ties with
customers by offering them "frequent talker" and other incentive
programs that cross lines of business.  Finally, bundling allows
the packaging of multiple services into compelling offerings or
special promotions.

     Convergence billing and customer care provides the capability
of offering combined bills, a single view of the customer, and
product and service offerings that cross lines of business (e.g.,
offering a free pay-per-view movie if a customer makes more than
$25 per month in long distance calls).

     It is by no means clear that convergence billing and customer
care are for every organization--or every customer.  It is part of
the folklore of convergence billing, for example, that consumers
may rebel when confronted with a large bill that includes costs of
several services, rather than several smaller ones.  It may be that
customer care with multiple bills is the best strategy for consumer
marketing, allowing branding and some amount of bonding and
bundling.

     On the other hand, one of the best things about convergence
billing is that, potentially at least, only one bill is being
mailed and only one payment is processed.  With low-revenue
consumer bills, mailing four or five remittances every month can
become expensive quickly.

     For business customers, convergence capabilities can provide
a significant advantage for competitors that offer them.  To date,
local exchange carriers and wireless carriers have, in many cases,
fallen far from meeting the billing needs of business customers,
particularly large ones with operations in multiple states.  

     The inevitable emergence of increased competition in these
markets will make billing capabilities a key differentiator, much
as it now is in the long distance market.  Business customers will
find favor also with competitors that can offer discounts for
bundling all their local, long distance and wireless service into
a single arrangement.

     Building or integrating a convergence billing and customer
care capability can be an arduous and expensive undertaking for an
organization, and it has a number of traps and pitfalls.  These
issues should be addressed when an organization is planning the
transition to convergence billing and customer care.

     Each organization will have its own set of business goals and
objectives for convergence; its own timetable for achieving them;
and its own set of current hardware, software, and data that must
be transitioned.  For these reasons building a detailed plan is
essential.

1.  Work Out the Business Issues First

     Convergence billing and customer care open up a whole raft of
business issues that should be dealt with before technical issues
are approached.  If the plan is to issue RFPs to vendors, having
some idea of how the converged businesses will be run will help
greatly in specifying what the vendors need to provide in its
solution.  If applications will be built or modified internally,
answers to the issues will aid internal information systems
organizations in the same way.  Some examples of common business
issues include the following:

     *    What organizational changes will be needed?

     *    How will sales, order processing, and customer support be
handled across the lines of business?

     *    Who will have ownership of the customer relationship
across the multiple lines of business?

     *    How will revenue be allocated in situations where
multiple lines of business are bundled under a single price to the
end customer?  How will the profitability of individual services be
assessed?

     Ideally, this should be a time when an organization can
explore new ideas about sales and support, like customer
self-provisioning and self-maintenance over the Internet, or the
elimination of billing altogether by offering fixed-price items
that are purchased at retail outlets or by credit card.  Increased
competition likely will lead to increased creativity in these
areas.

2.  Assess the Current Situation

     Once a set of working requirements for the convergence billing
and customer care environment have been developed, an organization
can evaluate the current system's ability to fulfill the
requirements or be modified to meet them.  "System" in this sense
is more than just software, it's also the people, organizations,
and procedures that surround the software.  Common items to assess
include the following:

     n  Do the current software applications and platforms merit
further investment, even if they are capable of being modified to
meet the requirements?  Since applications tend to bed in a wide
variety of states, this is unlikely to be a black-and-white issue. 
In fact, no large organization should expect to replace multiple,
large legacy applications in a short period of time, nor expect to
be able to replace them all at once.

     *    If the application is provided by a vendor, can the
vendor assess the ability to modify the package to meet the
requirements?  Issuing a convergence RFI is guaranteed to get the
incumbent vendor's attention, and it is useful in determining how
other packages might meet an organization's specific needs.

     *    Does the support infrastructure need to be addressed? 
For example, if the organization operates call centers, are they
equipped to meet the needs of the converged business?  Do they need
desktop PCs and wide-area network access?  Do they need more
sophisticated automated call handling systems?  For a large
organization, the cost of the support infrastructure can easily be
a substantial portion of the cost of a convergence project.

     *    Are there issues related to the location and staffing of
support centers?  For example, organizations that currently run
unionized call centers may not want to integrate new lines of
business into the current centers in order to keep the new
businesses non-unionized.  If the organization is entering markets
outside its traditional operating areas, the internal network may
need to be expanded to new areas and new support centers and
offices established.  If new lines of business will be integrated
into existing operations, how much training will be required for
current employees?

     *    If current lines of business will be converged, what are
the major issues related to merging customer information into a
common data store?  How are customers identified across lines of
business?

3.  Build the Blueprint

     The key items to building a detailed plan for implementing
convergence capabilities are the overall business plan, the
requirements for new capabilities, and the assessment of the
current situation.  If the business plan is extremely aggressive,
it is likely the same significant amount of the new capabilities
required will not be achievable on "opening day" for the new lines
of business.  In these cases, either the business plan must be
changed to match the reality of what is deliverable, or the
capabilities must be delivered in stages.

     Typically, a short-term strategy is devised to handle the
launch while minimizing risk and cost.  This may include putting a
proven existing application in place, with no convergence
capabilities initially, then integrating the billing and customer
care at a later date when the line of business has been established
and requirements have been better defined.

     If the addition of convergence capabilities is the main point
of the plan (for example, integrating the billing and customer care
for existing wireless and wireline lines of business), a
combination of short-term and long-term strategies may still make
sense.  

     A single customer data repository may be the highest priority,
or the production of a combined bill.  A short-term strategy would
focus on the highest priority items, while delivering the
longer-term solution in stages.

4.  Don't Promise the Impossible

     It is somewhat ironic that while business plans for
telecommunications often recognize the amount of time needed to run
fiber optic cable to every neighborhood in a city, or build
wireless cells to cover a region, software is often treated as
something that is simply expected to be ready on an arbitrary date. 
A few years ago one EDS customer announced internally that it would
completely reengineer its billing and customer care business
processes and systems within 18 months.  

     This carrier had taken more than five years to implement its
latest mainline billing application and hadn't yet fully
implemented it at the time it was making plans for the new systems
and processes.  Why were they sure it would be done in 18 months? 
Because they were told it had to be.  Within a year the effort had
been largely abandoned, a victim of a schedule with no connection
to reality.

     A common variation on this theme is to get a vendor to promise
to meet the arbitrary date, then blame it when the project fails. 
(Vendors sometimes have a pathological aversion to telling
customers no.)  Unrealistic schedules not only play havoc with
business plans, they prevent organizations from taking a fresh look
at how problems can be solved short term, while longer-term
solutions are put in place.  If the ideal solution can't be put in
place in six months, it's better to say that at the beginning, then
make plans to support the business that recognizes that fact.

5.  Keep Your Eyes on the Prize

     Customers do not care what kind of software generates their
bills or keeps track of their names and addresses, as long as it
works.  There should be some notion of proportionality to the
expenditures made for billing new services; it doesn't make sense
to spend tens of millions on changes to current applications to
support small amounts of revenue.  The objectives of convergence
billing and customer care initiatives should be to meet the needs
of the business and to do so cost-effectively.  Having a realistic
plan in place from the beginning that addresses the business issues
will help ensure both.

Convergence Demands Holistic 'Revenue Stream' Approach to Billing

By Vince D. Shaw, Deloitte & Touche

     An understanding of the importance of convergence issues on
billing and customer service is rapidly sweeping through the
telecom industry.  A new mindset, however, will be required to view
a customer's bill as the product of a series of systems and
processes that depend on many things not commonly understood to be
part of the billing process.  To understand billing effectively in
a world of telecom convergence, the revenue stream infrastructure
must be viewed as an integrated, interrelated whole.  Included are
processes to do the following:

     *    Establish service,

     *    Provide bills, and

     *    Collect revenues.  

     This concept has some important implications that are rarely
recognized.  Traditionally telcos have used the term billing system
to refer to message processing, rating, and bill assembly. 
Although this never was an accurate definition--even in the POTS
(plain old telephone service) environment--the damage was not too
severe since there were only a few, relatively simple products for
which to bill.

     This traditional definition, however, is no longer viable for
the array of products and services that even low-end customers now
expect to receive.  Nevertheless, the connotation persists that the
billing system is predominantly responsible for the bill itself. 
This perspective leads to misdirected efforts, confusion, and
frustration for customers and service providers alike.

     To realize the strategic potential of the billing system's
direct link to the customer, telcos must design their billing
capabilities with an eye toward numerous systems and procedures
outside the traditional billing process.  

     In fact, many of the things that determine whether a bill
reflects what the customer actually ordered--and whether the
customer's expectations are consistent with the bill--are linked to
information that the billing system assembles but does not create. 
Billing system designers, for example, must work very closely with
front-line customer service staff in order to appreciate the
aspects of billing that generate customer inquiries.

What is the 'Revenue Stream Infrastructure'?

     The revenue stream infrastructure includes not only the
traditional elements of billing but also the systems and processes
that support the following:

     *    Order entry and customer management,

     *    Accounts receivable, 

     *    Collections, and 

     *    Decision support and data warehouse functions derived
from the data contained in these systems.  

     Additionally, the infrastructure may include some elements of
provisioning and sales support, depending on the preference of the
provider and the degree to which these functions are integrated
with order entry.  

     The common thread among core functions is that they share a
common data model that describes the customer account structure as
well as all products and services.  The revenue stream processes
and systems, therefore, encompass the actions necessary to provide
services, bill for services, and collect revenues.

How Is the Revenue Stream Infrastructure Different?

     As billing issues become substantially more complex and
inseparable from overall customer service issues, telecom providers
must adopt a holistic revenue stream perspective in order to
survive.  This must be manifested both in terminology (e.g., don't
refer to "billing systems") and in organization (e.g.,
responsibility for billing quality must be assigned to someone at
the revenue systems level).

     "Billing" systems always have been dependent on the data
provided by order-entry and other related systems.  But the rapid
increase in the complexity of telecom products and services, and
the growing interdependence of the customer service and billing
functions, have made billing an inseparable part of the revenue
stream infrastructure.

     Reengineering of the billing function alone is unlikely to
succeed.  Any notion of reengineering that includes radical
redesign and major process improvements requires a broader focus
than that embodied in a billing-only scope.  While incremental
improvement can be achieved, radical improvement is unlikely.  That
is because billing systems traditionally are not a substantial
enough part of the revenue stream infrastructure.  

     Nevertheless, the cry, "We're reengineering our billing
process!" continues to be heard without a corresponding focus on
the wide range of issues that affect billing.  (Other impacts of
the revenue stream "perspective" are summarized in the table titled
"Interpreting the Revenue Stream," p. 10.)

What Specific Actions Are Dictated for Providers?

     Management responsibility must reflect the integrated nature
of the revenue stream.  If possible, a process "owner" must be
defined who has control across all of the revenue stream process. 
Designating separate managers for the systems that support billing
and order entry, for example, is virtually guaranteed to produce a
low-quality bill because there is no single point of accountability
for the various functions necessary to create the bill.

     A customer-driven focus to defining billing requirements is
needed.  While significant lip service is given to responding to
customer needs, the necessary actions often regress to the
traditional "We already know what the customer wants" approach.  A
recurring, objective process for monitoring customer requirements
is needed.  

     This means understanding  customer concerns and how billing
characteristics affect them.  For example, systems must be designed
to give customer service representatives a complete view across the
spectrum of available products.  The ability to quickly and
accurately answer a question is part of the overall billing
interaction in the customer's mind.

     Also, meaningful incentives should be offered for accurately
assessing customer expectations during the marketing and sales
process.  Sales people must understand that a bill is part of the
product being purchased; expectations regarding the bill must be as
clear as those regarding the rest of the product.

     Billing systems are a convenient target of criticism that
often is more appropriately directed at confusing policies
regarding pricing, proration, information display, or other things
that may generate customer queries.  Customer dissatisfaction with
such policies should not be confused with dissatisfaction about the
billing system.

     Service providers also must develop a core competency in
analyzing new billing requirements.  The bewildering array of
potential requirements often leads to the conclusion that
flexibility is the single necessary characteristic of a billing
system. 

     While system flexibility is critical, there is a practical
limit to the amount of flexibility that can be achieved.

     Flexibility should be supported in other ways, however, by
better preparing to handle the inevitable stream of new system
requirements.  This may entail establishing a formal process for
identifying new billing features that will provide a competitive
advantage.  

     Or if a company plans to outsource revenue stream processing,
it should focus on the degree to which the outsourcing contract
facilitates rapid, cost-effective response to new requirements as
it does on initial capabilities and costs.

     Finally, confusion about the underlying business reason for a
billing feature is, in our experience, the most common reason
implementation of billing requirements breaks down.  

     Therefore, focus on the process of correctly translating
business requirements into system requirements.  This is equally as
important as investing in flexible systems.  Prototyping, extensive
end-user involvement in design reviews, and early user involvement
in test planning will benefit this process.  Only by focusing on
complete revenue stream systems, rather than on traditional billing
systems, can companies resolve the billing issues raised by telecom
convergence.

CSG Goes Public Amid Market Uncertainty

     Billing services vendor CSG Systems International, Inc., will
offer 2.9 million shares of its stock in an initial public offering
for $13 per share.  The shares represent about 11.5 percent of the
company, which is valued at $382 million.  In 1994 the company was
purchased from First Data Corp. by its executive employees for $137
million.

     CSG is a leading provider of billing services for the cable TV
industry, with clients serving more than 16 million subscribers. 
It is facing the loss of major clients, however, as cable companies
increasingly opt to perform their own billing functions.  Among
these is CSG's second-largest customer, Tele-Communications, Inc.
(TCI).  

     The drive among cable TV companies to pull billing services
in-house is being driven by the desire to offer telephony and new
interactive services over coaxial cable networks, analysts have
noted.  These services require incremental billing and rating
capabilities that current billing platforms for cable TV cannot
handle.  

     In addition, large-scale billing outsourcers are facing
increasing completion from smaller processors that are much easier
for service providers to manage.  

     To counter the loss of outsourcing business, CSG has developed
"Phoenix."  The company had said the system is the first major
billing system based on client/server architecture and open
standards (CBR, Jan. 12).  

     Phoenix's first customer is Continental Cablevision, based in
Boston, which is also building an in-house billing and customer
care system dubbed "Concert."  Phoenix will be a major component of
the new system, but CSG will not finish installation until sometime
in the second quarter, and service is not scheduled to begin until
fall.

Loral Chief Taking Globalstar Reigns;
Move Seen as Plus for $2 Billion Project

     As part of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s $10 billion deal to
acquire most of Loral Corp., Globalstar L.P. will get a respected
industry leader to champion it in the "Big LEO" (low earth-orbit)
mobile satellite services market.  Bernard Schwartz, Chairman of
Loral, will become Chairman and CEO of Loral Space and
Communications Corp., a new company to be formed in connection
with the Lockheed Martin/Loral deal.  Loral Space will be the
managing general partner of Globalstar, inheriting Loral's 31%
stake in Globalstar as well as other assets.

     Mr. Schwartz is widely credited with building Loral from an
unprofitable company two decades ago into a multibillion-dollar
industry leader today through a series of strategic acquisitions. 
The addition of Mr. Schwartz to the Globalstar management team
diminishes a major criticism of the $2 billion project, said
Robert Kaimowitz, a satellite communications analyst at Unterberg
Harris in New York.  Globalstar has been criticized for lacking a
focused management team, Mr. Kaimowitz noted.

     Mr. Schwartz said at a press conference announcing the deal
that he plans to focus most of his time on Globalstar.  Having
Mr. Schwartz champion Globalstar "strengthens" the global
communications project, Mr. Kaimowitz said, adding that Mr.
Schwartz's involvement "ensures that the system will be built."

     He expressed doubts that the competing global satellite
systems of Iridium, Inc. (led by Motorola, Inc.) and Odyssey (led
by TRW, Inc.) both would make it to the market.  In a research
report on Globalstar, analysts at Unterberg Harris recently
wrote:  "We do not believe that Iridium will present real
competition because of its complex [satellite] architecture,
expensive pricing, and murky marketing plan.  Although Odyssey
has proposed what many experts believe is the best system
architecture, we have yet to see signs that TRW/Teleglobe [of
Canada] is close to raising the money necessary to build the
system. . .Our view is that Globalstar's real competition will be
ICO Global Communications (Inmarsat-P), possibly resulting in
only two players in a potentially large market."

     Globalstar spokesman Tom Ross echoed similar comments
regarding Mr. Schwartz, noting that the executive's track record
is "very, very good."  In addition to his duties as Chairman and
CEO of Loral Space, Mr. Schwartz will become a Director and Vice
Chairman of Lockheed Martin.  Globalstar investors applauded the
news, sending its shares up $6.375 to close at $40.50 on the day
of the announcement.

Lockheed Martin To Buy Most of Loral

     In a deal valued at more than $10 billion, Lockheed Martin
will buy Loral's defense electronics and system integration
businesses for $9.1 billion, including $2.1 billion of assumed
debt.  It also will invest $344 million for a 20% equity position
in Loral Space at an effective price of $7.50 per share. 
Lockheed Martin will pay $38 in cash per share to Loral
shareholders through a tender offer that was scheduled to begin
Jan. 12.  Loral shareholders also will receive one share of Loral
Space for each share of Loral.  The transaction is expected to
close by the end of February.

     Loral Space will begin business with more than $700 million
in cash and no debt, the companies said.  Lockheed Martin will
provide Loral Space with support in key technologies while
remaining a major maker of military and commercial satellites. 
In addition to the 31% stake in Globalstar, Loral Space will
receive Loral's 33% interest in Space Systems/Loral, a commercial
satellite manufacturer, and its 22% interest in K&F Industries,
Inc., an aircraft brake company.

     Other assets of the new company will include all of Loral's
Globalstar service provider franchises in Canada, Mexico, and
Brazil and Loral's interest in proposed projects involving
domestic and international direct broadcast satellite (DBS) and
broadband data services.  Mr. Schwartz said Monday, Jan. 8, that
Loral Space will use its Space Systems/Loral holdings to expand
the new company's DBS business.

     Mr. Kaimowitz said Loral Space has a book value of $1.8
billion or $7.80 per share.  After backing out cash, Globalstar
represents 83% of the assets of Loral Space, he noted.  Loral
Space's book value is broken down as follows:

     *    The 31% interest in Globalstar ($650 million),

     *    The 33% interest in Space Systems/Loral ($150 million),

     *    The 22% interest in K&F ($50 million),

     *    2.8% in management fees from Globalstar ($250 million),

     *    $700 million in cash, and

     *    An undetermined value for the service provider
franchises.

Schwartz Holds Out for Higher Globalstar Value

     Mr. Schwartz said one reason Lockheed Martin did not acquire
all of Loral was the high price he placed on Loral's 31% interest
in Globalstar.  Seeing value in the creation of a global
communications network of 48 satellites, Mr. Schwartz pointed out
that globally, more than 3.9 billion people lack telephone
service, and 30 million people currently are waiting for a phone. 
If Globalstar begins service as scheduled in 1998, Mr. Schwartz
predicted that the company would have three million customers and
$2.7 billion in annual revenue by the year 2002.

     Globalstar's current capital structure consists of $300
million of equity from its 11 partners and $200 million of equity
from its initial public offering in February 1995.  Loral Space
is the largest Globalstar shareholder, followed by public
shareholders as a group and then Qualcomm, Inc., with an 8%
stake.  Vendor financing adds another $300 million, and a new
bank financing agreement chips in $250 million.  Additional
internal financing--payments from exclusive service providers
(the local telephone companies) in 73 countries--will contribute
another $350 million over the next few years.

     The $2 billion project still requires $600 million in
additional external financing.  Mr. Schwartz said that Globalstar
would try to raise the money in the debt markets or would turn to
Loral Space and Globalstar's other investors for the funds. 
Globalstar pulled a $400 million high-yield debt offering from
the market in October.  Mr. Kaimowitz said this happened not
because of a lack of investor interest, as widely believed, but
because Globalstar could get "debt at a cheaper price" from the
banks.

     He noted that Loral Space's $700 million in cash and no debt
provides "a vast opportunity to finance the Globalstar project in
very creative ways, with less need for traditional financing
methods."  

     The Lockheed Martin/Loral deal is subject to U.S. and
European antitrust and other approvals.  It also requires at
least two-thirds of Loral's shares to be tendered.

     Lockheed Martin Chairman Daniel Tellep and Mr. Schwartz said
they do not expect antitrust concerns to stymie the transaction,
especially since Loral's space business will remain a separate
company.  Mr. Kaimowitz agreed, noting that the businesses
Lockheed Martin is acquiring from Loral have very little overlap
with its existing operations.  A $10 billion credit agreement for
Lockheed Martin is being led by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Bank
of America, and Citicorp USA.

Intelsat Will Consider
Restructuring Plan This Year

     By September, Intelsat's Board of Governors expects to have
"a better idea of the future structure" of the international
satellite consortium, reports Maury J. Mechanick,
VP-international and regulatory affairs for U.S. signatory Comsat
Corp.  Intelsat has a "restructuring work plan in place," he said
during a public briefing on actions taken at the board's year-end
meeting in Washington.  A special Intelsat "working party" and a
special board committee are exploring the future structure of the
consortium, he explained.

     As part of Intelsat's ongoing effort to improve customer
service, the board decided at its December meeting to establish
four regional service support centers.  Intelsat also will
restructure its sales and marketing division and establish new
internal accounting processes.

     Commenting on financial matters, Mr. Mechanick said the
board approved Intelsat's 1996 budget, which projects $876
million in total revenues and $496 million in capital
expenditures.  Those figures represent a 10.8% increase in
revenues and a 25% decrease in capital expenditures from the 1995
budget.  He said preliminary figures show actual 1995 revenues
totaling $800 million, while operating expenses were $75,000
under budget.

Sterling Software To Spin Off
Electronic Commerce Group

     One of the world's largest software development firms,
Sterling Software, Inc., will spin off its lucrative Electronic
Commerce group this year to create a wholly owned subsidiary,
Sterling Commerce, Inc.  According to Dawn Wheeler, who will
direct investor relations for the new company, an initial public
offering is scheduled for the first quarter of this year.  The
IPO will comprise 16% of Sterling's common stock.

     The company filed an S1 registration document with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Dec. 20, 1995, and expects
approval within 60 days.  Once the IPO is complete, the company
will begin a tax-free spin-off by Sept. 30, the end of Sterling's
fiscal year. 

     The Electronic Commerce group experienced growth of 35% in
1994--about 5% above the growth rate of the electronic commerce
market in that period, according to company figures.  This record
continued into 1995:  The group had revenues of $217.8 million
for the year, an increase of 31% over the previous year's figure. 
Operating profit increased 33% in the same period.

     The group's success is due, in large part, to its recent
focus on developing software for small and midsize businesses, as
well as its strong position in the electronic data interchange
(EDI) market.  In 1994, Sterling acquired American Business
Computer Company, Inc., a leading provider of EDI translation
software for the UNIX platform.

     But the most visible--and possibly the most important--move
for the Electronic Commerce group was its work last year with
Visa International, Inc., to develop the E-Pay system.  E-Pay is
a "fully electronic system for processing consumer-initiated
bills," the companies said.  It relies on a collection of EDI
standards that allow electronically generated bills and bill
payments to be processed by banks, billers, and other financial
institutions.  Sterling provides the key EDI-based software that
translates Visa account and customer information into a
standardized format and reconciles payee lists between billers
and their banks.  Currently, about 70% of electronic payments are
first converted to paper before being processed.  E-Pay, which is
designed to eliminate that step, will be a major building block
of Internet-based billing platforms of the future.

Analysts Cite Antitrust, Market Issues
For Possible Bell Atlantic-NYNEX Merger

     Although it would make "a lot of sense" for Bell Atlantic
Corp. and NYNEX Corp. to merge their local exchange or future
interexchange operations, antitrust and other issues could dampen
enthusiasm for pursuing a deal, industry analysts say.  Few were
surprised by recent press reports that executives of the two
companies have had preliminary merger discussions.  They note
that the "Northeast Corridor" market that a combined NYNEX-Bell
Atlantic could serve would provide substantial revenues if
federal legislation allows Bell companies to provide interLATA
(local access and transport area) services.

     "The synergy between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic is apparent
when you view their market," one interexchange industry observer
emphasizes.  The combined Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and
Washington areas would constitute "perhaps the most lucrative
single market in the U.S."  But some analysts caution that
increasing competition could erode the companies' local exchange
market shares.  They also warn that potential clashes over top
positions in the combined companies and layoffs could temper
enthusiasm for merger talks.

     Believing that the compromise on federal telecom legislation
is "very positive from a NYNEX perspective," analysts William D.
Vogel and Alexandra E. Kairis of NatWest Securities Corp. suggest
that a further combination of specific NYNEX-Bell Atlantic
businesses (not a full-blown merger) may make sense:  

     "The facilities-based test for local telephone company entry
into long distance does not specify any market share requirement
or percentage of lines passed by a second local carrier.  We
believe Congress understands that the long distance industry is
an overpriced cartel with excess capacity, and that more
competitors will result in lower prices and more meaningful
choices for residential and business customers. . .

     "NYNEX has fewer hurdles than any other Bell company.  With
the competitive environment fostered by the regulators in New
York and Massachusetts, NYNEX has already got facilities-based
competition as well as substantial unbundling of network elements
already under way.  We believe they will be fully compliant by
1997 if the present language passes.  This is great news for
customers because of the buying power NYNEX will have as it shops
for long distance minutes from AT&T, MCI, and Sprint on behalf of
its residential and business clients."

     They say "a case could be made that aggregating NYNEX and
Bell Atlantic's customer base to combine their buying power for
long distance minutes, as well as sharing marketing and
back-office costs, could make sense.  However, a full-blown
merger of the two companies at this time while the two firms are
already in the process of undertaking tremendous restructuring
programs seems provocative but unrealistic."

     A recent study Probe Research, Inc., explores the combined
performance of the NYNEX and Bell Atlantic telephone companies
between 1988 and 1994.  "The telephone side of the business for
these two companies is just not generating enormous returns,"
says Allan Tumolillo, Probe's Chief Operating Officer.  As
measured by revenues and assets per line, the performance of the
telcos has been "relatively flat," he notes.  Data for both
companies shows that per-line revenues and assets have increased
by less than 0.5% annually, according to The Telephone Book IV, a
report based on the study.  Similarly, measurements show that
revenues and assets increased about 7.5% per employee at both
companies during the period from 1988 to 1994.

     "They've achieved that because [Bell Atlantic and NYNEX]
have gotten rid of employees," Mr. Tumolillo explains.  "All the
cash flow has been generated through employee reductions."  The
combined number of employees dropped from about 143,600 in 1988
to about 105,400 at the end of 1994.  If the companies merge, Mr.
Tumolillo predicts they would eliminate duplicative positions and
reduce the payroll by about 10,000 more employees over the next
18 to 24 months, generating more cash flow.

     He suggests that a combined company "hunker down and become
a primarily urban company."  NYNEX has "no strategic reason" to
be in Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire (except for the outlying
Boston suburbs), and some parts of central and upstate New York,
he says.  Independent telcos could purchase those exchanges,
pursuing a "clustering" strategy similar to that pursued by the
cable TV industry.

     Any merger discussions between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic
probably would not resemble the negotiations that preceded Bell
Atlantic's abortive attempt to merge with cable giant
Tele-Communications, Inc.  NYNEX and Bell Atlantic "know each
other's business very well," Mr. Tumolillo points out, citing the
companies' combined cellular operations.  Nevertheless,
leadership issues could arise.  Neither Bell Atlantic
Chairman/CEO Raymond W. Smith nor NYNEX Chairman/CEO Ivan G.
Seidenberg is nearing retirement age.

Relationship Already Exists Based on Cellular Deal

     Robert H. Mayer, Senior Manager-telecommunications
consulting for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group, suggests that
a NYNEX-Bell Atlantic deal might come together smoothly because
the companies "already have a relationship through the cellular
business."  The CEOs "get along and have a vision" for their
companies, he says.  He also predicts substantial corporate
"downsizing" if a merger takes place, particularly in "corporate
services" units overseeing human relations, legal, and external
affairs functions.

     Commenting that the field is increasingly becoming a "market
for big players," Mr. Mayer expects any Bell company merger to
trigger a new flurry of deals between other telecom giants.  But
whether Bell company mergers can pass antitrust muster could
become the "$64,000 question," some observers believe.  The
Clinton administration "hasn't been very aggressive" in bringing
antitrust cases, Mr. Mayer notes.  "If the Democrats haven't been
[aggressive], Republicans probably would be even less so."  While
the Justice Department may not "put [Bell company mergers] under
a microscope," it will take action if it finds that predatory
pricing is being used to stifle competition, he says.

     Some analysts believe that Pacific Telesis Group could be a
potential Bell Atlantic-NYNEX partner, creating a "huge
enterprise" carrying traffic between the coasts--"the most
sizable and lucrative single chunk of the interexchange market,"
one observer says.  The three companies combined also could carry
half of the international traffic in the country, says Richard
Klugman, First Vice President at PaineWebber.

     Philip J. Sirlin, a telecom analyst at Schroder Wertheim &
Co., Inc., says a merged Bell Atlantic-NYNEX could have more
difficulty defending local exchange markets.  He also questions
whether any merger deal could satisfy both Messrs. Smith and
Seidenberg.  "This is never a trivial issue in a merger," he
says.  "And when you have two roughly equivalent companies,
you've got a particular problem. . .That alone reduces some of
the likelihood" that a merger deal will be concluded, he
suggests.

     Meanwhile, interexchange carriers are the new focus of
merger and acquisition discussions at Bell companies, Mr. Sirlin
says.  By acquiring an interexchange carrier such as LDDS
WorldCom, a Bell company could acquire a national network
relatively quickly.  "I wouldn't be surprised if every [Bell
company] is studying the feasibility of acquiring WorldCom right
now," he comments.  "And they should be."

The Telecom IPO Scoreboard:
How Did They Fare on Wall Street?

     This issue contains CBF's quarterly Telecom IPO Scoreboard
and related charts tracking upcoming initial public offerings. 
Every quarter, we report on companies poised to go public in the
next 30 to 60 days, those that have filed initial paperwork with
the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public in the
future, and the progress of companies that recently began trading
on the stock exchanges.  

     Readers can track the number of IPOs in telecom-related
sectors, how these IPOs are performing relative to the overall
market, and how one company's pubic offering fared on Wall Street
compared with that of others.  

     An increasing number of offerings (a larger pipeline of
money being fed into IPOs) would indicate greater venture capital
and entrepreneur interest in this sector.  A decrease in IPO
activity could indicate that interest is dampening or that the
market is reflecting information it has impounded about previous
offerings and is taking a "breather."

Impact of Legislation on Bell Companies
Depends on Regulatory Constraints

By Larry F. Darby

     Previous articles have discussed the probable effects of
regulatory reform legislation on various telecommunications
communities of interest--the broad public interest, consumers,
large users, the cable TV companies, and the long distance
carriers.  Such legislation is long overdue, and depending on the
final details to emerge from conference, the bills promise to add
considerably to development of the telecom infrastructure while
spurring economic growth and employment.

     The legislation will give users greater choice and lower
rates, both of which will accompany new market entry and
intensified competition among large, well-capitalized companies
whose markets now are protected from competition by statutory,
regulatory, and judicial barriers to market entry.

     The major threat to the enactment of legislation is that
some key lawmakers may succeed in imposing their view that
competition is too important to be left to the marketplace and
that our national welfare is best served by pervasive regulatory
interventions.  There still is considerable pressure from
interest groups to protect regulatory prerogatives and to have
major market conflicts resolved in administrative proceedings
rather than in the marketplace.  So, what else is new?

Bell Companies Are at a Turning Point

     We have deferred discussing the impact of legislation on the
Bell regional holding companies because much of the controversy
among House and Senate conferees centers on that issue.  It
remains to be determined whether, how, and to what extent the
final bill will permit RHCs to enter new markets and compete,
thereby compensating for the increased competition they will face
from long distance carriers and cable TV system operators in
their own core markets.

     The RHCs have evolved in very different directions, and
those differences will become more pronounced over time.  After
divestiture they shared some common goals:

     *    Become less reliant on regulated lines of business for
earnings,

     *    Reduce reliance on outside funding for network
construction and business expansion,

     *    Gradually finesse the line-of-business constraints
embodied in the Modified Final Judgment, and

     *    Meet shareholders' general requirements for growth and
earnings (in large measure by escaping the strictures of
rate-base, rate-of-return regulation).

     The RHCs generally have succeeded in meeting these broad
objectives, some more than others.  All have diversified their
earnings streams and growth opportunities.  Two of them --SBC
Communications, Inc., and U S WEST, Inc.--are generating about
half the basis for their total market capitalization outside the
regulated telephone business.  Wireless services and investments
in telecom assets in other countries make up the bulk of these
outside sources of market value.

     Most of the companies are able to fund their construction
requirements from depreciation accruals.  In recent quarters, the
sum of net income and depreciation charges has been about 15%
greater than the cash required to pay dividends and to fund the
construction budget.  (For context, we note that AT&T generates
about 50% more cash than is required for dividends and
construction, while the average for carriers in Europe is about
25% greater.)

     The companies have been quite successful in escaping the
confines of traditional earnings regulation that effectively
stripped them of the benefits of efficiency gains and
opportunities for earnings growth.  Price cap regulation of
federal access charges and a variety of incentive and price cap
plans in the states have almost completely supplanted
rate-of-return regulation as the dominant form of earnings
control.  These regulatory changes, more than any others, have
accounted for increased market valuation of these stocks in
recent years.

     Notwithstanding these successes, the Bell companies still
are trapped in the slowly growing, increasingly risky domestic
local wireline markets.  Market penetration is in the 95% range,
and new installations of primary lines are limited to the rate of
new housing starts.  Revenue growth from usage growth is stymied
in many jurisdictions by the imposition of flat-rate,
unlimited-use tariff structures.  In fact, usage-sensitive
pricing of local telephone services is unconstitutional in some
states.  

     The companies have been growing revenue by adding vertical,
value-added services made possible by software-controlled digital
switches.  Call waiting and forwarding and related services have
added handsomely to local revenues, but more ambitious forays
into broadband distribution--video dial tone, for example--have
not been too successful.  The RHCs still are burdened with rate
structures that do not match underlying cost structures, and the
resulting high-margin services have attracted considerable
interest from competitors.  New competition and the prospect of
even more entry (from long distance carriers and cable TV
systems) increases market risk substantially in the local
exchange.

Legislative Impact on Bells Depends on Regulatory Restraints

     The Bell companies look to the legislation (1) to permit
them to pursue new opportunities for growth and (2) for the means
to offset increases in market risk.  And when all is said and
done, the impact of the legislation on the RHCs depends on
details still being worked out.  Under any legislative outcome,
the Bells will be handicapped by their lack of experience in
competing openly in the marketplace.  J.B. Clark noted nearly a
century ago that "The greatest of all monopoly profits is the
quiet life."  So it is here.  Competition to date in the local
market is but a vague hint of what is about to come.

     Though the ultimate fate of Bell companies in the
marketplace will be determined by their ability to adjust from
the comfort of monopoly to the rigors of competition, the
legislation may either handicap them or accommodate their
transition.  Two elements of the legislation--and the way in
which regulators follow them up--are key to the Bells' success in
the new competitive environment.  The first is the timing of
competitive market entry; and second is the extent to which the
legislation imposes regulatory constraints on "competitive
adjustments" by the Bells and by their competitors.

     Time is money.  The timing of new competitive entry into
local and long distance markets is critical to the financial
valuation of both classes of carrier.  There has been much debate
in the conference committee about delaying RHC entry into the
long distance business until a date certain, or until specific
statutory requirements are met.  Frankly, I am a little puzzled
by that debate:  It is unclear how the public interest is served
by delaying RHC entry into the long distance market. 

     The argument that competition should be suppressed in that
market until it is more vigorous in the local exchange market is
not compelling.  The argument seems ultimately to turn on the
assumption that regulation is ineffective in prohibiting
anticompetitive market behavior.  Be that as it may, any
differences in the timing of lowering local and long distance
market entry barriers will be damaging to the Bells.  The battle
over customer control and the outcome of competing "one-stop
shopping" offers largely will be prejudged if the final bill
handicaps RHC entry into the long distance marketplace.

     A casual reading of the various "competitive checklists"
that have been advanced as necessary conditions precedent for
Bell company entry into the long distance market read like a
"communications lawyers' full employment act."   

     They are a sure blueprint for protracted market uncertainty
and regulatory/judicial delay.  Competitive safeguards in the
hands of clever legal advocates can be transformed into
regulatory barriers to entry.

     The second determinant of the impact that legislation will
have on the Bells has to do with competitive responses and
obligations.  AT&T and other long distance carriers have
supported language that will force the Bells to make bulk
capacity available to them for resale at "out-of-pocket" or
"avoidable" costs.  

     Despite economic efficiency arguments for such a
requirement, this pricing rule would permit long distance
carriers to avoid contributing to the fixed costs of the network,
thereby shifting that burden to other users.  In any event, such
a pricing rule would favor the long distance carriers to the
detriment of the local Bells.  Such a requirement, combined with
lags on the ability of the Bells to enter the long distance
market, would cause the RHCs to lose the accounts of large and
profitable customers to long distance carriers.  The RHCs'
ability to respond to new entrants and to defend their markets is
also critical.  In this regard, history is not very encouraging. 
AT&T was saddled with the regulatory baggage associated with its
designation by the FCC as a "dominant" carrier, long after the
market was regarded by most observers as workably competitive. 
The practical effect of such regulation has been, and will be,
"cartel management" by the regulators.

     The means of managing the allocation of market shares has
been the tariffing process--delays in the introduction of new
services and minimum rate restrictions on competitive services. 
New entrants' success in arguing that rate responses by
incumbents are predatory or embody cross-subsidies will be
critical to incumbents and new entrants alike.

     If legislators and regulators regard themselves as
instruments of market reallocation from incumbents to new
entrants, and if they adopt "fully distributed cost" allocation
rules for competitive services and "marginal cost" principles for
pricing resold bulk local capacity, the Bells will surely be big
losers.

UBS Analysts Tout Geoworks
For 'Concept-Oriented' Investors

     The pieces are "finally in place for the CCD (consumer
computing device) market to begin its long-awaited ramp,"
according to analysts Jeffrey A. Schelsinger and Scott W. Searle
at UBS Securities.  They view Geoworks, Inc.'s GEOS operating
system as "an enabling technology that will play an important
role in the development of this market.

     Given the "huge market opportunity for these devices, the
positioning of the company with leading consumer electronic
manufacturers, and the tremendous degree of operating leverage,
we believe Geoworks (GWRX) represents an excellent opportunity
for concept-oriented investors to play the convergence of network
computing and mobile communications."  Their investment thesis
follows:

     Over the last 20 years the binary world of ones and zeros
has driven tremendous change in the computer and communications
industries.  Maturing digital technology has facilitated market
transitions in these sectors, where companies with truly enabling
technology--technology that reduces cost and/or increases
functionality--have emerged to become industry leaders.

     When positioned on the right side of changes in technology,
investors have benefited from these market transitions. 
Centralized computing gave way to distributed processing and
desktop PCs (Compaq, Intel, Microsoft); stand-alone PCS were
connected into local area networks (Novell, Cisco, Bay Networks);
and now the promise of inter-networking and the Internet itself
(Spyglass, Netscape, UUNet) is creating very interesting
investment opportunities.

     Although much less mature, the wireless communications
industry also is undergoing significant change.  Analog
voice-centric networks are giving way to new digital systems
capable of efficient data communications.  Service markets once
characterized as monopolies/duopolies are becoming highly
competitive, as proliferation of wireless networks is occurring. 
Market focus and distribution channels for wireless products are
migrating from expensive verticals to low-cost mass consumer
markets.

     This is all well and good, but for the most part, the pony
is already out of the barn.  Where then is the next great
undiscovered opportunity?  Convergence.  The combination of
network computing and wireless communications will "untether"
users from enterprise networks and desktop PCs, thereby enhancing
the sharing and processing of information.

     As internetworking proliferates and the computing platform
becomes more hierarchical--the intelligence resides in the
network, not at the node--new consumer-oriented mobile computing
devices will emerge.  Online, as opposed to on-site, computing
places the "cost of computing" on the network and, therefore,
requires significantly less functionality in end-user devices. 
Less functionality means lower costs, which drives market
penetration.

     These next-generation devices will, however, have sufficient
computing resources to easily communicate with enterprise
networks, the Internet, and desktop PCS.  They will be packaged
in a truly mobile form factor (organizer/mobile telephone) and
have a cost structure consistent with other consumer electronic
devices.  All this is essential if the goal of indispensable
utility is to be reached (i.e., integrated into our daily lives).

     These new CCDs will start out as extensions of existing
consumer electronic product lines such as electronic organizers,
mobile companions, cellular telephones, and pagers.  In addition
to being interoperable with desktop PCs and enterprise networks,
these mobile devices will also support numerous wireless data
applications for messaging (e-mail, fax, and paging), information
delivery, remote access, and of course, the Internet.

     CCDs will utilize many existing digital technologies. 
Low-cost memory chips, fast and efficient microprocessors, and
high-resolution graphics displays all will be required.  The
idiosyncrasies of mobility and wireless communications, however, 
require new technology that will have to (1) be
communications-centric (wired and wireless), (2) be interoperable
with enterprise networks (the Internet and desktop PCs), and (3)
compensate for the limited bandwidth of wireless communications. 
The constraints of size, cost, and battery life are significant
in the world of mobility.

     With a focused strategy to deliver software products that
meet the price/performance demands of mobile computing, Geoworks
is well positioned to become a leading provider of operating
system and application software to the emerging CCD markets.  The
company's GEOS operating system offers a level of functionality
and efficiency that enables manufacturers of CCD devices
(electronic organizers and cellular telephones) to provide the
features and cost structure (less than $500 to the end-user)
necessary to penetrate the mass consumer market.

     Admittedly, the CCD market is in the early stages of
developing.  However, the adoption of the company's GEOS
operating system by several leading consumer electronic
manufacturers (Hewlett Packard, Nokia, and Toshiba) leaves
Geoworks very well positioned to capitalize on the convergence of
computing and wireless communications.

The Market:  Despite Failed Attempts, Huge Opportunity Exists

     The ability to tap into the vast organizer and mobile
telephone markets with value-added features will ultimately
ignite explosive unit volume growth.  We estimate that the total
CCD market will grow to $13 billion by 1998, with operating
system revenues accounting for approximately $250 million.

     First organizers & PDAs -- The organizer/PDA (personal
digital assistant) segment of the CCD market--devices priced at
more than $250--will drive early demand, as next-generation
mobile telephones ("smart phones") are not expected to be
introduced in Europe and Asia until late 1996.  The U.S. will be
at least another year behind because of a lack of digital
cellular/PCS infrastructure.  The organizer/PDA market segment is
forecast to grow from 4.4 million units in 1995 to 18.6 million
units in 1998.  Whereas low-end electronic organizers are
expected to grow only 6% per annum, PDAs with higher
functionality are forecast to grow 150% annually through 1998.

     The result:  a combined end-user market of $10.5 billion,
with PDAs representing 80% of the market.  Assuming royalties of
$10-$15 per unit, the organizer/PDA operating system market would
be valued at $186 million (based on $10 per unit) by 1998.  A
royalty of $10 per unit equates to less than 35% of the end-user
cost ($350) of a typical organizer/PDA CCD device.

     Then smart phones:  The worldwide market for digital mobile
phones is forecast to grow from 7 million handsets in 1995 to 20
million handsets in 1998, representing a $25 billion market. . .
An increasing percentage of these handsets is expected to
represent digital mobile phones with intelligent capabilities for
processing, storing, and communicating data information ("smart
phones").

     The installed base of smart phones is expected to reach 4
million by 1998, or approximately 20% of the digital phone
market. . .Assuming the smart phone market captures 10% of the
digital phone market, operating system revenues from this CCD
segment could exceed $75 million by 1998.

     Additionally, we believe the add-on product market could
represent an $80 million market by 1998, assuming one in two
purchasers of an organizer/PDA buys an add-on application for
$20.  We view this as conservative, in that Microsoft reports
add-on sales of 1:1 or better for applications relative to
operating system sales.

The Geoworks Solution

     Geoworks develops and markets operating systems and
applications for the emerging CCD market.  Geoworks' principal
system software, GEOS, is designed to meeting the constraints of
the mobile environment--limited microprocessor, memory, and
storage capacity.  GEOS provides a combination of functionality
and efficiency required by CCD hardware vendors in providing the
features and cost structure necessary for this market to follow
the explosive growth pattern of other successful consumer
electronics products.

     Strategy is simple:  Establish the GEOS operating system as
the de facto standard in the mobile CCD market.  Success at the
operating system level opens up the opportunity to sell
high-margin add-on software applications into the installed base
of users.  Initially, the target markets will be handheld
electronic organizers/PDAs (data-centric users) and smart phones
(voice-centric users).  Over time, higher-level information
appliances and interactive TV may be added.

     Strategic relationships --  Geoworks has entered into
strategic relationships with leading OEMs in the electronic
organizer and mobile telephone markets.  Several partners have
taken an equity interest in GWRX.

     *    Nokia -- The second leading provider of digital GSM
phones in Europe intends to incorporate GEOS in its first smart
phone, expected to be released next year.

     *    Hewlett-Packard -- It will incorporate the GEOS
operating system into a number of product lines, starting with
its sub-$350 electronic organizer, the Omnigo 100, which was
successfully introduced into European and U.S. markets this past
October.

n  Toshiba Corp. -- This leading consumer electronic manufacturer
plans to use GEOS in its development of smart phone products for
Asian markets.

n  Novell -- A leading provider of network operating systems, it
has authorized Geoworks to include Netware client software in its
GEOS system software for seamless integration with Novell
networks.

     Each of these companies has made a significant equity
investment in Geoworks for a combined ownership of approximately
18%.  Recognizing that wireless communications will drive
explosive growth in the CCD market, Geoworks has recently
announced a number of additional strategic alliances in this
area:

4  Notable Technologies -- provider of add-on software for
information delivery over paging networks;

4  Skytel -- leading provider of nationwide one-way and two-way
paging services;

4  Wynd Communications -- provider of wireless two-way messaging
services including e-mail via the Internet, fax, alpha paging,
and phone messages.

Leveraging the Model

     Geoworks' financial model maintains a tremendous amount of
operating leverage.  Unit volume growth in a royalty-driven
revenue model ($10-$15 per unit) drives contribution and earnings
as operating costs remain relatively fixed.  With increasing unit
volume shipments, we believe fully taxed net margins could exceed
20% in 1998.  This is reflected in our fiscal 1998 EPS estimate
of $0.50.

     Near term, the revenue stream will likely be lumpy,
reflecting the recognition of deferred revenues pertaining to
terminated projects.  In fiscal 1997 we project ships of
GEOS-based organizers/PDAs and smart phones to exceed 450,000 and
150,000 units, respectively.  This would represent royalty
revenues of approximately $7.5 million.  In addition, deferred
contract revenues of $3.5 to $4.0 million and add-on products'
sales bring total revenue in fiscal 1997 up to $13.3 million.

     For fiscal 1998, we anticipate total revenues of $38 million
($18.5 million in royalties plus $10.5 million from add-on
products).  In terms of operating expenses, we forecast healthy
growth in R&D expenses (25%-30%) to further develop GEOS and
add-on applications.  With sales and marketing provided by OEM
distribution channels, marketing and G&A expenses are expected to
grow modestly (15%-20%).  We believe positive operating leverage
can expand operating margins above 30% in fiscal 1998.

     Assuming the story unfolds as we think it will, and unit
volumes begin to ramp significantly in fiscal 1998, GWRX could
easily generate after-tax EPS in excess of $1.00 in fiscal 1999. 
Because of the high degree of operating leverage, this would only
require a 64% increase in revenues, year over year.  Furthermore,
if the company's existing OEM partners maintain their current
market share with respect to these next-generation products, our
fiscal 1999 numbers could prove conservative.

     Consequently, we have set our 18- to 24-month price target
at $30, or 30 times our tentative fiscal 1999 full-taxed EPS
estimate of $1.00.

The Year Ahead:  Merrill Lynch
Still Likes AirTouch Stock

     Analyst Linda J. Runyon at Merrill Lynch & Co. notes that
one of her firm's themes in 1995 was "to go international with
regard to cellular" holdings, and AirTouch Communications, Inc.
(ATI) "certainly fits this profile."  ATI is the sixth-largest
U.S. cellular company with 38 million population equivalents
("pops"), and the third-largest U.S. paging company with more
than 1.9 million pagers in service.  The company tops her
year-end list of recommended telecom/cellular stocks.  Ms.
Runyon's comments follow:

     ATI's international exposure continues to grow in both size
and importance.  In fact, the company now has more than 69
million "pops" through interests in licenses in Germany,
Portugal, Sweden, Belgium, South Korea, Italy, India, Spain, and
Japan.  For 1995, we estimate that ATI's proportional interests
in its international ventures will represent approximately 31% of
proportional revenues and 17% of proportional operating cash
flow.  By the year 2000 we believe that these numbers could grow
to as much as 46% and 44%, respectively.

     Moreover, we think that ATI's valuation is compelling at
these levels--especially given the 22% pullback in the shares
since mid-September.  On a valuation basis, we have a 12- to
18-month price objective of $35 per share, or 27% above current
levels.

What Has Changed?  Competition, from Within and Without

     *    First, we now have AT&T and MCI gearing up to go
head-to-head in wireless.  AT&T has recently gone nationwide with
its AT&T Wireless brand name, while MCI has chosen to go the
reseller route.  If MCI's experience with the resale of paging is
any indication of things to come in cellular, it could prove to
be an interesting year.

     *    Second, we now have more consumer packages being
introduced into the market.  We've got TeleGo from GTE and Talk
Along from Bell Atlantic/NYNEX.  Basically, we're starting to see
zone-sensitive packages, priced to attract the lower-usage
subscriber.  Nevertheless, revenue/subscriber/month continues to
decline faster than originally estimated.

     *    And third, personal communications services (PCS) are
coming, there's no doubt in our minds.  The first round of
auctions ended in March, and the second round of auctions is set
to begin shortly.  We've now got Sprint Spectrum PCS service in
Washington/Baltimore.  The question remains:  When does PCS
arrive on a widescale basis?  We think it's at least 1997-1998.

Current View:  Go Small or Go International?

     There's really no way around it.  Frankly, 1995 was a
difficult year for cellular equities. On average, the stocks in
our group are flat year-to-date and down over 30% relative to the
S&P 400.  As one portfolio manager pointed out, it was difficult
to perform that badly in 1995.  So, why did the stocks perform so
badly, and what does that mean for 1996?

     During 1995 the downward leg began with the PCS auctions,
continued with the LIN Broadcasting private market valuation
process, and gained new momentum this fall with concerns over the
rate of subscriber growth during 3Q 95.

     We understand the concerns over PCS.  We understand the
concerns over the LIN valuation.  So let's look at subscribers. 
During 3Q 95, subscribers included in our matrix of 19 companies
grew 42.4%, revenues grew 31.5%, and operating cash flow grew
42.3% versus 3Q 94--somewhat surprising given the stock
performance.  So, what is going on?

     Currently, the issue on everyone's mind is handset growth. 
Given comments by some of the equipment manufacturers regarding
U.S. analog handset revenue growth, the perception seems to be
that everyone who ever wanted a phone already has one, and that
growth as we know it has come to an end.  We don't happen to
agree, but it's interesting.

     In fact, over the course of the year, we have raised our
1995 ending subscriber estimate from 32.5 million to 34 million,
for 40.8% growth over 1994.  This implies a penetration rate for
the industry of more than 13.0%.  For 1996 we are estimating
ending subscribers of 44.4 million, up 30% over 1995, for a
penetration rate of 16.9%.  We'd like to point out that every
year so far--without exception--we have underestimated subscriber
growth.  But the question still remains, will 4Q 95 subscriber
growth be on target?  It's still too early to tell given that
50%-60% of the growth during the quarter comes in December.

     So, why go small or go international?  We recognize that
this is a repeat of our theme last year, and although it's small
consolation given the overall performance of the sector, smaller
market operators did outperform larger market operators during
1995.  We think that this trend could continue, given our belief
that competition will come to the smaller markets later and that
consolidation of smaller operators will continue over time.  With
regard to international, we see significant potential growth
opportunities, especially in some of the more underpenetrated
markets.  In many cases, we see international growth occurring at
a faster rate than growth here in the U.S.

1996 -- KEY ISSUES

     1.    Is subscriber growth slowing or not?  We think that
ultimately growth in net additions has to slow given the sheer
size of the wireless business.  However, we think that ending
subscriber numbers will continue to be strong in 1996, especially
given the added distribution power that AT&T and MCI will bring
to the table.

     2.    What exactly does PCS mean for the cellular business? 
When will PCS really enter the market?  How will it be priced? 
How will it affect growth?  How will it affect margins?  In other
markets, such as the U.K., the introduction of PCS has helped to
accelerate growth of the overall wireless market.  We expect that
this could ultimately occur in the U.S.  However, we don't
anticipate seeing widespread PCS until 1997-1998.

     3.    How is PCS going to be financed?  We think this could
be the single most important issue during 1996, as many of the
PCS operators look to raise financing within a similar time
frame.

     4.    And lastly, when will commercial CDMA (Code Division
Multiple Access) technology really be available, both for
cellular and for PCS?  We believe that ongoing uncertainty about
this issue will continue to cloud the competitive picture for
those cellular and PCS operators who have opted for CDMA.

BCI, INDIA's TATA GROUP IN TELECOM SERVICE PACTS

     Bell Canada International (BCI) and India's Tata Group have
formed a consortium to provide telecom services in the Indian
state of Andhra Pradesh, where the companies have won one of two
cellular telephone licenses.  The consortium also was found to
have submitted the only acceptable bid in the Jan. 1 bidding for
a basic telephone service license in Andhra Pradesh, BCI said.  

     Tata will hold 51% of the equity in the basic phone service
and cellular service companies, and BCI will own 39%.  The
remaining 10% will be held by American International Group, a
U.S. insurance firm.

     BCI said it could invest $35 million for the cellular
venture and about $100 million for the basic telephone service
venture.  Derek H. Burney, BCI's Chairman, President, and CEO,
said that "with cellular and basic service licenses in India,
cellular operations in Colombia and China, and cable [TV]
licenses in Brazil --each with strong local partners--BCI is
strategically positioned in some of the most attractive emerging
telecommunications markets in the world."

SPRINT VENTURE PARTNERS COMMIT $4.4 BILLION

     Comcast Corp.'s third quarter report notes that the Sprint
Telecommunications Venture (STV) partners will contribute $4.4
billion in cash to the venture over the next three years,
"subject to agreement upon an initial business plan."  Comcast
said its share--$660 million--could be reduced because of "the
method of crediting in-kind contributions to STV by the
partners."  

     Through Sept. 30, 1995, Comcast made cash capital
contributions of $338.8 million to WirelessCo, STV's planned
nationwide wireless communications network.  The other joint
venture partners are Sprint Corp., Tele-Communications, Inc., and
Cox Cable Communications, Inc.  They plan to offer a package of
local exchange, long distance, wireless, and cable TV services.

BROOKS FIBER ACQUIRES ENGINEERING, CONSULTING COMPANY

     Competitive local exchange carrier Brooks Fiber Properties,
Inc., has acquired the domestic consulting and engineering
business of its affiliate, Brooks Telecommunications, Inc.  The
international operations of Brooks Telecom will be spun off into
a new company, Brooks Telecommunications International, Inc.  The
transaction will make Brooks Fiber a "full-service" telecom
provider, the company said.  Brooks Telecommunications had owned
15% of Brooks Fiber.

     The move will give Brooks Fiber engineering and software
expertise, allowing it to offer customers a "new depth of
consultative support," according to CEO James C. Allen. 
Acquiring the domestic consulting unit--dubbed GLA International,
Inc.--will give Brooks Fiber more management information systems
(MIS) capabilities, improving its ability to meet interexchange
carrier (IXC) customers' service requirements, Mr. Allen said. 
IXCs have "voiced perpetual disappointment with MIS shortcomings
of the older [local exchange carriers]," he added.  Brooks Fiber
now will have about 300 employees and could have revenues of more
than $40 million in 1996, it said.

S.C. COMMISSION ORDERS BellSouth's PRICE CAPS

     In adopting a price cap plan for BellSouth
Telecommunications, Inc., the South Carolina Public Service
Commission properly has "recognized the need" for alternative
regulation of local exchange carriers, BellSouth says.  Greg
Morton, Director-corporate and external affairs in South
Carolina, told CBF, however, that a five-year "freeze" on basic
local service rates "is too long in a competitive environment." 
BellSouth had proposed a freeze for only three years.  

     Mr. Morton said BellSouth is "disappointed" that the PSC
included a 2.1% "productivity factor" in its recently adopted
price cap formula.  After the plan's fifth year, BellSouth will
be allowed to increase basic service rates by an amount equal to
the rate of inflation, minus the 2.1% productivity factor.  Its
intrastate switched access rates are capped for three years.  For
"nonbasic" (competitive and "discretionary," or optional)
services, BellSouth has pricing flexibility, subject to a 10%
annual limit on rate increases.  The PSC will maintain oversight
authority and can refuse to allow rate increases.

U S WEST EXCHANGE

     Pacific Telecom, Inc., has agreed to purchase 32 rural
Minnesota exchanges from U S WEST Communications, Inc., which
previously had announced that it would sell the exchanges to
another company, HTC Group.  

     That deal collapsed because of "a change of investment
priority on the part of HTC Group partners," according to a
statement issued jointly by all three companies.

     HTC still plans to acquire U S WEST exchanges in Iowa, and
the Bell company is negotiating with two or three other companies
to sell Nebraska exchanges, a U S WEST spokesman said.  Federal
and state regulatory approvals are needed before the exchanges
can be transferred.

AT&T TO SELL CIRCUIT BOARD PLANT IN RESTRUCTURING

     A retired AT&T Corp. executive has assembled an investment
team that plans to bid on the AT&T Microelectronics factory in
Richmond, Va., which is slated to be sold as part of the
company's streamlining and restructuring plan.  Hobart A. Weaver,
who helped start the Richmond Works printed circuit board factory
more than 20 years ago, told CBF Jan. 16 that he expects to
receive a sales proposal from AT&T within 60 days.  Mr. Weaver
said he has lined up New York investment bankers Peter Dixon and
Wilmer Thomas, with whom he has participated in several past
ventures, for bidding to acquire the plant.  He said he also
hopes to include the factory's almost 2,000 employees as
part-owners of a new public company.

     He said he informed AT&T last April that he was interested
in purchasing the plant.  Mr. Weaver, who retired from AT&T in
1982 as head of manufacturing operations in North Carolina, was
GM of the plant when it opened in 1973.  He said he has contacted
the Communications Workers of America local representing the
Richmond Works employees and expects the plant to remain a union
shop.  An AT&T spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Weaver's
plan, saying only that the company is "talking to several
potential buyers."

     The Richmond plant, which manufactures printed circuit
boards and "backplanes," has about 1,950 employees.  "We plan to
initiate discussions with potential buyers in the next few
weeks," said the unit's President, Curtis J. Crawford.  He said
the largest customer of the plant's products, AT&T Network
Systems, "expects to continue to depend upon the Richmond Works
as a major supplier after the sale."  CWA, which represents
nonmanagement employees at the plant, said, "We had just turned
the corner on making the plant profitable for the first time in a
long time, and this is the thanks we get."

     AT&T Microelectronics will become part of the systems and
technology company to be spun off from AT&T on Jan. 1, 1997.  A
spokesman for the unit said company planners see "no strategic
advantage in owning the factory. . .We find it makes more sense
to invest in some of our other businesses. . .Historically (we)
tended to make everything we needed," he said.  "But over the
years, we've reevaluated and asked whether we really need to be
making these [products] ourselves.  In the case of these circuit
boards, we decided we didn't."

ANALYSTS PRAISE PACIFIC BELL's NEW 'PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR'

     Rejecting requests to eliminate price cap regulation, the
California regulators have told Pacific Bell to freeze basic
local rates for at least three years.  They also adjusted Pacific
Bell's price cap "productivity factor."  Pacific Bell previously
was subject to a 5% factor.  The new factor is keyed to the rate
of inflation.

     John Gueldner, Pacific Bell VP-regulatory, said the action
"sends the right signal to companies based in California as well
as those considering investing here.  It will allow us to
continue investing in our California infrastructure and will
encourage economic growth and jobs throughout the state." 
Analysts at Merrill Lynch & Co. viewed the PUC's decision as
"positive" for Pacific Telesis Group.  The analysts kept their
1996 earnings-per-share estimate of $2.55.

     "Had the 5% productivity factor been maintained, the
required rate reductions in 1996 would have been about $63
million (net of miscellaneous price increases)," they noted. 
Because of increasing local exchange service competition, Pacific
Bell likely will use its "downward pricing flexibility" to reduce
rates "for those services likely to be most targeted by
competitors," offsetting "much of the $63 million cushion"
provided by the PUC's recent decision, they added.

WARREN PUBLISHING ACQUIRES WASHINGTON TELECOM NEWSWIRE

     We're very proud to announce that Warren Publishing has
purchased Washington Telecom Newswire, a unique daily news service
covering the telecommunications industry.  As a wide variety of
Communications Daily subscribers already know, Washington Telecom
Newswire can be a very powerful complement to the Daily.

     Newswire subscribers receive, via fax or e-mail,
Washington-based telephone industry news stories throughout the
business day, usually within an hour of the event.  FCC and
congressional hearings, corporate press conferences and major
telephone industry developments are reported in Washington Telecom
Newswire before they appear anywhere else -- including "on the
Internet."

     The Newswire was purchased from Editor and Publisher Christine
Valmassei, who began the service in 1993 and will continue as
editor and publisher.  The Newswire will remain separate from Comm
Daily, with a separate editorial staff.

     Beginning in 1945, Warren Publishing pioneered first in
weekly, then daily and now almost hourly coverage of
communications.  As the pace continues to pick up in the industry,
we're ready for the next 50 years.

     We eagerly invite you to sample Washington Telecom Newswire at
no cost or obligation.  Simply call Warren Publishing Circulation
Manager Betty Alvine at 202-872-9200.

FCC SHUTDOWN MAKES IT DOUBTFUL JAN. 18 AGENDA MEETING WILL BE HELD

     Scheduled FCC agenda meeting on Jan. 18 now is very much in
doubt because of extended govt. shutdown over budget fight between
Administration and congressional Republicans.  It's Commission
policy that staff items to be considered at open meetings be sent
to commissioners by bureaus and offices involved 21 days before
meeting (CD Oct 23 p4), although that deadline can be waived by
commissioners.  Jan. 18 date hasn't been canceled formally, but FCC
sources told us it surely will be.  Other Commission matters also
will be delayed when govt. returns to work, they said, because no
one has been around to work on issues, digest comments, etc.

     Agency had scheduled Jan. 30 en banc session on spectrum
issues to be chaired by Comr. Ness because of her special interest.
At that meeting, new ways to allocate spectrum were to be discussed
by invited witnesses.  Commission is required by law to meet at
least once each month and there's now talk that Jan. 30 session
will be considered as meeting for month.  However, since agency
legally can't put out notices or news releases during
budget-mandated shutdown, any decisions must await its formal
return to work, according to sources.

     Among hardest hit by shutdown have been contractors, such as
maintenance, security, vending, transcription services.  Martin
Clark, pres. of ITS Inc. document service, said he's losing $20,000
daily and has laid off all but 10 of his work force of 45.  A few
are on board because auctions generated small amount of business,
he said.  Clark said he kept his employees on payroll during
week-long shutdown in Nov. but couldn't afford it in Dec. layoff.
He said he doesn't expect to recoup losses because experience has
shown his average daily revenues of $20,000 "don't change" after
snow days and other shutdowns.  ITS paid employees for Christmas
Day because "I just had to," Clark said.  "I'm angry, very angry
about this.  Millions of people across the United States that do
work for the government are hurt by this shutdown."

     Although most FCC employees were sent home because of lack of
funds, some were permitted to continue working on such things as
auctions, court arguments and international matters (CD Dec 19 p2).
FCC's Block C PCS auction began Dec. 18, first day of shutdown, and
ran through Dec. 21, when it took holiday recess.  Specialized
Mobile Radio (SMR) auction also continued week of Dec. 18.  SMR
auction resumes Jan. 2, Block C auction Jan. 5.  Auction staff
continued to work last week.  Call to Auction Div. Fri. revealed "7
or 8" employees were on board along with Wireless Bureau Chief
Michele Farquhar and Assoc. Bureau Chief Rosalind Allen in front
office.

     We're told couple of staffers from Office of Legislative &
Intergovernmental Affairs were in briefly Thurs. but were were gone
next day.  Gen. Counsel's office was staffed week of Dec. 18
because 2 court arguments were held that week.  Common Carrier
Bureau now is nearly empty, with only one employee classified as
essential to oversee network reliability;  same is case with Mass
Media Bureau.  "I am literally the only person on this floor," said
FCC employee on 8th floor Fri.

     Some commissioners have been seen entering and leaving
building from time to time during 2-week shutdown, not staying
long, but according to law their personal staffs aren't permitted
to work.  However, during Nov. shutdown, commissioners' staffers
continued to work by telephone, mostly from their homes, and in at
least one case met in Va. home of Jane Mago, senior legal adviser
to Comr. Chong, on children's issue in approval of Westinghouse
takeover of CBS (CD Nov 20 p1).

     Likely to be delayed by shutdown is approval of Disney Co.'s
$19-billion purchase of Cap/ABC, which had been expected to be on
agenda for Jan. 18 meeting.  Numerous deadlines for filing comments
have passed while Commission has been closed, including on AT&T
request to be reclassified as nondominant carrier for international
services, Southwestern Bell request to be classified as nondominant
provider of interstate services and Ameritech request to assess
end-user common line charges to resellers.  In addition to
comments, FCC will be hit with avalanche of petitions, complaints
and applications once agency reopens.  One lawyer said stacks of
petitions cover table in his firm's conference room, all waiting to
be filed.  "I can't imagine the long lines that will form" at FCC
filing rooms once shutdown is over, PCIA Regulatory Dir. Robert
Hoggarth said.

     Meanwhile, on Fri. President Clinton resumed meetings with
Senate Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker Gingrich
(R-Ga.) in effort to resolve budget issues.  Meetings were expected
to continue through New Year's weekend.

HILL SAYS BROADCASTERS WON'T GET 'GIVEAWAY'

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on
budget and telecom bills said Fri. that staff-level negotiations
have rejected White House proposal for broadcasters' early return
of analog spectrum in exchange for digital spectrum.  Sources said
no deal has been reached on spectrum issues as high-level talks
continued at White House.  They also said that there would be "no
giveaways" to broadcasters as part of final budget deal.  Statement
contradicted assertion by Senate Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.), who
was reported by Reuters Thurs. as objecting to what he called
"giveaway" of spectrum to broadcasters.  Dole also said there were
problems with telecom bill, but he wouldn't elaborate.

     Sources said some published estimates of value of analog
spectrum to be given back after conversion of broadcasting services
to digital technology have been wildly exaggerated.  While some
reports have put value of spectrum as high as $70 billion, sources
said figure is more in neighborhood of $6 billion.  That amount,
they said, wouldn't include costs to society of having industry and
consumers convert to new technologies before either is ready.
Negotiators also rejected White House proposal for $1-billion
subsidy to consumers to help them adjust to conversion through
purchase of set-top boxes.  Forcing consumers and industry in short
term to use technology that market hasn't found to be ready could
short-circuit development of advanced TV (ATV) services, Hill
sources said, adding that FCC has wide discretion to determine
whether ATV licenses should be awarded and what conditions should
be attached, including disposition of analog spectrum.

     Dole's assertion that there were "3, 4 or 5 provisions" in
bill that needed fixing also raised intriguing situation of having
him contradict rest of Senate leadership, including Commerce
Committee Chmn. Pressler (R-S.D.) and senior committee Democrat
Hollings (D-S.C.), who said deal is in final form.  House
Republicans haven't accepted that, and still were working to make
changes, principally in sections that had been removed from bill
and that they wanted restored.

     For example, House sources said that Senate wanted removal of
provision that would preclude FCC from regulating Internet,
provision that was in House bill but not in Senate's.  House
measure, sponsored by Reps. Cox (R-Cal.), Wyden (D-Ore.) and White
(R-Wash.), passed by 420-4 as part of wider piece of bill also
aimed at combating cyberporn.  Republican sources said debate on
regulation provision revolved around argument that there's no
telling what services Internet would carry in future, whether it be
common carrier, mass media or video now regulated by separate
titles of Communications Act.  It didn't make sense to "preempt
regulation in perpetuity," sources said.  Sponsors were working to
have clauses restored.

     Similarly, Rep. Oxley (R-O.) would like language revived that
would lift restrictions on foreign ownership of common carrier
licenses.  Sources said there was no agreement between House and
Senate on measure, so it was dropped because Senate language that
would allow FCC to revoke licenses of foreign owners of U.S.
businesses was "worse than nothing."  Conferees will begin to
receive conference report this week after returning from break.
But some senators not only received it, but signed it, before
leaving for Christmas.  It will be up to parliamentary experts to
determine status of conference report if lawmakers have signed,
believing it to be final version, while others say it's still open
for discussion.  House sources said bill isn't final until majority
of conferees have voted for it, but at same time they don't expect
major changes.

     House sources said that bill "substantially reflects the work
of the House" in conference, noting particularly requirement for
facilities-based competition pushed by Commerce Committee Chmn.
Bliley (R-Va.), and checklist concept of Telecom Subcommittee Chmn.
Fields (R-Tex.).  Other parts, however, were "watered down by the
Senate," sources said, although Bliley believed that final product
should be supported.  Sources said House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.)
hasn't directed that specific changes be made, although meetings
this week may cover those subjects.  Gingrich and Majority Leader
Armey (R-Tex.) have said that problems with bill need to be
resolved.

CELLULAR MARKET GROWS 71.4% WITH ACCELERATED EXPANSION IN SOME
NATIONS

     Worldwide cellular market expanded 71.4% to 71.1 million from
mid-1994 to middle of last year, fueled by triple-digit gains in
emerging markets and healthy growth in industrial nations of
Europe, Asia, U.S. Commerce Dept. said in annual survey.  Through
6 months, growth was 35.6% globally, up from 52.4 million at end of
1994.  U.S. accounted for 43% of subscribers, followed by Japan
with 7.5%.  Scandinavian countries accounted for highest
penetration rates, in excess of 10%.

     "Midyear worldwide cellular subscribers reveal that the market
is still growing at an incredible rate," said Stephanie McCullough,
telecom analyst in Commerce's International Trade Administration
(ITA).  "There are developments on the horizon which will surely
accelerate that growth in several countries."

     Competition in Japan and Israel spurred double-digit growth --
122% in Japan and 110% in Israel, she said, as 2nd networks
accelerated subscriber base.  Similar trends are likely when
Belgium, Ireland, Korea, Taiwan and Poland introduce competition
this year, she said in report.  Indonesia ended 25% import duty on
cellular phones, which should cut prices from current $800-$2,500
range and accelerate growth, McCullough said.

     Small countries posted phenomenal growth "where the
introduction of wireless service is one way to meet the vast
pent-up demand for telephones," she said.  Colombia (1,666%),
Lebanon (1,100%), Bulgaria (723%), Ukraine (542%) and Belarus
(500%) led world, but markets of Greece (162%), Spain (93%), Norway
(76%) and Sweden (71%) also boomed, she said.

     Million-user group includes U.S. (31 million), Japan (5.3
million), U.K. (4.5 million), Germany (2.93 million), Italy (2.86
million), China (2.5 million), Australia (2.4 million), Korea (1.4
million) and France (1.1 million) as of mid-1994.  Poised to join:
Thailand (983,000), Norway (800,000), Brazil (750,000), McCullough
said in report, available only on Internet on ITA homepage
(http://www.ita.doc.gov).

     Latest survey, issued as govt. shutdown began, said Chinese
market could be most interesting this year, with UniCom building
out Global System for Mobile network to compete with provincial
networks.  Country will offer analysts opportunity to test dynamic
of 2 govt.-owned systems in competition.  "China, too, holds huge
potential for cellular growth," McCullough said.  Delays in
awarding licenses in India retard access to huge market, and use of
GSM technology could limit U.S. exports somewhat, she said.

     National breakdown showed govt. delays in Haiti have pushed
back award of national cellular license from late Sept. until early
this year, and in Austria collapse of ruling govt. threatened delay
in GSM tender offer.  In Australia, Spectrum Management Authority
is phasing out analog network with conversion to all-digital
technology by Jan. 2000, report showed, with users encouraged to
shift to Telstra, Optus and Vodaphone GSM networks.

     City of Baltimore has complained to American Personal

     City of Baltimore has complained to American Personal
Communications (APC) about interference from company's new PCS
service.  In Dec. 27 letter that also was sent to FCC, Md. Attorney
General's office said APC's PCS service is harming communications
service that supports Baltimore's mass transit system.  Utilities
Telecom Council (UTC), trade association that represents microwave
incumbents, said letter "validates the concerns that incumbents
have long expressed over the potential interference and severe
service disruption" that PCS could cause to microwave operators.
City said that on at least 2 occasions, APC created such serious
interference that Baltimore's communications links had to be
rerouted to telephone lines.  In both cases, it said, APC
transmitter was tuned improperly to interfering frequency.  City
said communications interruptions "posed a grave threat to public
safety," particularly since police communications also were
threatened.  Letter comes as APC is negotiating with Baltimore to
relocate city's communication system.  City said in letter that it
wants reimbursement for costs it incurred "as the result of APC's
negligent failure to properly tune and operate its transmitter."
Reimbursement can be either condition of future relocation or
separate payment if relocation agreement isn't reached, city said.

     CompuServe Pres. Robert Massey said Fri. he doesn't expect to
encounter opposition from other on-line services as result of
company's decision to block access to 200 Internet-based bulletin
boards at request of German prosecutors.  In interview on CNBC,
Massey said:  "CompuServe will comply with the law.  You will get
no argument from other on-line service providers over that.  This
is a major issue we are all wrestling with.  It's a very
controversial issue."  Massey said that although some members have
posted comments critical of CompuServe's actions, he hasn't heard
of any subscribers' dropping service.  He said CompuServe was in
unique position compared with other on-line services because half
of its subscribers are outside of U.S.  List of banned sites
circulating on Internet included several containing pornographic
photos but appeared to be based on words in their title rather than
content.  Some of banned areas include:  (1)
Alt.sex.bestiality.barney, reference to children's program
character.  (2) Alt.sexy.bald.captains, homage to Star Trek
character Capt. Jean-Luc Picard.  Several have discussions of gay
issues.

sued TW in dispute over transfer of its franchise to TW from
KBLCom, even though city refused to approve transfer (CD July 10
p6).  Nicholas Miller, Washington attorney for Laredo, said parties
had agreed on temporary injunction to block transfer until TW
offered motion to dissolve injunction.  City offered countermotion
to find receiver for system, but judge quashed both motions and
turned injunction into preliminary injunction.  He said in order
that city was likely to succeed on merits of case and set
preliminary court date in spring if mediation isn't successful.

COMMUNICATIONS TODAY'S TOP STORIES OF THE YEAR

determined by the editors of COMMUNICATIONS TODAY:

1.   TELECOM REFORM LEGISLATION

     It is not quite a done deal yet, but it certainly has dominated
the headlines during the past 12 months.  The Senate passed its
telecom bill (S. 652) in June, and the House followed suit in August
(H.R. 1555).  A 45-member conference committee now is trying to work
out--once and for all--sticky issues such as foreign ownership and
public utility company entry into telecom.

2.   THE PCS AUCTIONS

     The FCC's auction of 99 broadband PCS licenses (the "A"- and "B"-
blocks), which ended March 13 after 112 rounds of bidding, deposited
more than $7 billion into the government's coffers.  The next round--
the "C"-block auction--was scheduled to begin 75 days later, but due
to a series of long, drawn-out court challenges, the auctions didn't
actually get underway until Dec. 18, more than nine months later. 
Four rounds were completed before the holiday recess, with bids
reaching $1.2 billion.

3.   AT&T RESTRUCTURING

     The long-distance giant stunned Wall Street in late September
with the news that it was restructuring its single corporation into
three separate entities:  communications services, communications
equipment and transaction-intensive computing.  Chairman Robert Allen
said the move is the "next logical turn in AT&T's journey since
divestiture."

4.   SPRINT/DEUTSCHE TELEKOM/FRANCE TELECOM ALLIANCE

     The FCC approved the sale of 20 percent of Sprint Corp. to
Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom last month, nearly a year and a
half after the deal was originally announced.  The foreign telcos each
will acquire 10 percent interests in Sprint as part of the Phoenix
alliance that will offer global telecom services.  Sprint also is
expected to earmark part of the funds for its broadband personal
communications services (PCS) venture.  Sprint also announced in 1995
that it was spinning off its cellular unit.  Analysts said the
cellular company, which has more than 1.2 million customers, is worth
between $3.6 billion and $5 billion.

     Cellular pioneer Craig McCaw shocked the telecommunications world
when he announced that he and his family would invest more than $1
billion in Nextel Communications Inc., the Rutherford, N.J.-based
specialized mobile radio (SMR) provider.

     The Walt Disney Co., Ameritech Corp., BellSouth Corp. and SBC
Communications announced in April that they were sinking $500 million
during the next five years into a venture that will create programming
to be played via the three regional holding companies' (RHCs) video
dialtone (VDT) networks.  The venture will rival the Tele-TV venture
formed by Pacific Telesis Group, Bell Atlantic Corp. and NYNEX Corp..

8.   ROCHESTER BECOMES LABORATORY FOR LOCAL COMPETITION

     Rochester, N.Y., became the site for the first true test of
competition in the local telephone service marketplace.  AT&T and Time
Warner Inc. jumped into the city's local marketplace to challenge
incumbent provider Frontier Corp..  While Frontier declared the test a
success, AT&T and Time Warner complained that they could not turn a
profit by reselling Frontier's local service for 95 percent of the
retail price.

9.   MCI ALLIES WITH NEWS CORP.

     MCI Communications Corp. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. launched
an alliance that will mesh the strengths of the two companies to
create information, education and entertainment services for
businesses and consumers worldwide.  The companies each will invest
$200 million into the as-yet-unnamed venture.   The nation's second
largest long-distance company certainly had a busy 1995, acquiring SHL
Systemhouse Inc. [SHKIF], a Canadian-based information technology
services provider, for about $1 billion, and Nationwide Cellular

10.  PAGING INDUSTRY MARKS YEAR OF CONSOLIDATION

     Mergers and acquisitions highlighted 1995 for the paging
industry.  The biggest-ever merger in the industry occurred in
September, when MobileMedia Corp. bought BellSouth Corp.'s MobileComm
for $945 million to become the second-largest paging provider in the
country.  Arch Communications Group purchased USA Mobile
Communications for more than $450 million and Westlink Paging for $340
million.

FOCUS ON WORLD TELECOM NEWS

     A Hong Kong-based investment company has become the latest
foreign player to step into China's tightly restricted telecom market,
with plans to develop a $20 million global system for mobile
communications (GSM) for second national carrier Lian Tong
Telecommunications Corp. 
     CNK Telecommunications Services (CTS) is forming an equity joint
venture with Zhong Shan Group and China Unicom Equipment Co to finance
and build the network in Nanjing. The system, which will have an
initial capacity of 20,000 subscribers, will be operated by Lian Tong. 
However, the agreement provides for consultancy and maintenance
services to allow CTS to monitor the disbursement of project finance. 
     China currently prohibits foreign direct investment in telecom
networks as well as participation in the operation and management of
telecom services on the Mainland. 
     Like other similar Lian Tong projects, the CTS joint venture has
not yet been approved by the government nor has it been formally
incorporated.  To date, the government only has approved similar
investments by Nextel Communications Inc. in the Lian Tong Shanghai
GSM network and another GSM project in Suzhou involving Singapore
Telecom.  Other projects involving players such as Ameritech Corp.,
Telstra and Hongkong Telecom still are waiting approval. CTS was set
up by a private independent investment company, EK Investment Group,
to invest in telecom projects in China.  CTS will have an 80 percent
stake in the Lian Tong venture, with the remainder held by the Chinese

partners. 

BroadVision Lands Hong Kong Deal

     On-line software company BroadVision Inc. plans aggressive
expansion into Asia this year, following its selection by Hongkong
Telecom as a strategic supplier for a $1.28 billion interactive
multimedia services network.  The system, which is scheduled to go on
line in July, will deliver video on demand, home shopping and other
interactive on-line services to 80 percent of Hong Kong's 1.61 million
TV households within five years. 
     The Los Altos, Calif.-based company hopes Asian business will
account for more than 30 percent of its revenues by the end of 1996. 
As part of that effort, it plans to announce local partnerships
agreements and "significant" expansion plans into China in the coming
weeks, according to CEO Pehong Chen.    BroadVision is providing the
business operational support system for the Hongkong Telecom project.
Chen declined to comment on the progress of contract negotiations with
Hongkong Telecom.   However, William Lo, managing director of Hongkong
Telecom IMS Ltd., said negotiations over "minor" details have delayed
final agreement on most of the supplier contracts. Lo did note that
work is continuing despite the ongoing contract discussions.
     Contracts have yet to be signed with Hongkong Telecom's other key
suppliers: Fujitsu Ltd and Iwatani International Corp., which are
providing the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and access network
systems; Hewlett Packard Asia Pacific Ltd., which is supplying the
gateways and media servers; Sybase Inc., which beat out Oracle Corp.
for the middleware contract; and NEC Corp., which is supplying set top
boxes.  Lo hopes these contracts will be signed early next year.

DMTF Alters Mgm't Course

By:
BETH DAVIS

In a move that will delay the management of remote desktops,
the Desktop Management Task Force has scrapped its work on
a pivotal specification, opting instead for a standards-based
approach.

The group last week said it has stopped working on its Remote
Desktop Management Interface, slated for completion by the
new year.

Instead, the task force is now advocating the use of remote
procedure calls as the best approach for sending and accessing
information about the desktop across distributed networks.

The change of heart has slowed the DMTF's progress on a remote
specification, and network managers were divided on whether
the move will prove advantageous.

"I think it's a positive move to go with standards that are
already out there,'' said Arnold Howard, a senior PC LAN analyst
at a large financial institution in Boston. "Why reinvent the
wheel? Even if it doesn't have all the bells and whistles,
you end up with a broader base of customers and products."

Others see potential pitfalls. A single specification-like the
original RDMI-would ensure that the industry follows one set
of guidelines and applications vendors would have to write
code for only one method of communications.

Allowing use of different RPCs as the pipeline between the client
and server will force third-party vendors to either choose
which RPC they want to support or include code for all the
RPCs in their applications, said Glen Farrell, LAN system coordinator
at Firestone Textiles Co., Woodstock, Ontario.

"When it's multiple choice, it is not a standard. And RPCs are
proprietary solutions, even if they are widely implemented,''
said Rick Sturm, a principal at the Enterprise Management Institute,
San Francisco, and a network manager at one of the Bell companies.

"From a user's perspective, as long as the functionality is
there and you are able to exchange information even if you
are using more than one management application, it shouldn't
matter," said Ki Wilson, a senior microcomputer analyst at
Stone Container Corp., Chicago. "But since there is not a dominant
RPC on the market, that leaves an open-ended question for the
vendors as to which one to support."

DMTF chairman Ed Arrington said the switch keeps pace with the
organization's goals and objectives. "It is kind of a step
back, but we really want the market to make the decision here.
We don't want to be in the business of telling people what
to do," he said. "We're not a standards-forcer.''

In fact, that was the reason DMTF initially hesitated on a specification
that outlined a common way to access or send DMI information
across the network. The group had hoped the industry would
settle on a de facto standard.

Without a remoting specification, however, users must rely on
proprietary mechanisms to pass the management information that
is gathered by DMI across the network. When the industry failed
to rally around a single method, DMTF decided to develop its
own.

Since work began on the RDMI, several DMTF members have proposed
alternatives.

Last September, two proposals were presented: Distributed Computing
Environment, an IBM- and Microsoft Corp.-backed RPC; and the
Common Agent technology developed by IBM, Sun Microsystems
Inc. and several other companies.

After considering all options, DMTF decided on a Procedural
Interface, which Arrington said is "an easily remotable interface
that uses standard RPCs.''

Although the interface requires use of an RPC, it does not specify
which RPC to use. DMTF likely will allow the use of at least
three different RPCs, including DCE, Sun's Open Network Computing
and Novell Inc.'s Transport Independent RPC, Arrington said.

The interface enables an RPC to set up a pipeline between the
management application and the managed desktop. Like the original
RDMI, it will work with any connection, whether it is a LAN,
WAN or telephone link.

And though the work is several months behind DMTF's original
target of December 1995, using RPCs as the remoting technology
could mean products come to market faster. Many applications
ship with RPCs already embedded in them; for example, Microsoft
Windows 95 includes support for DCE.

The interface document has been drafted and is now undergoing
a second revision. It is expected to be completed in the next
few months, Arrington said.

In addition to the RPC remoting method, DMTF is completing its
work on the Simple Network Management Protocol-to-DMI mapping
agent. The technology will let SNMP applications manage DMI
compliant systems.

Although both the Procedural Interface and the SNMP-to-DMI mapping
agent are expected to be completed before the second half of
1996, Arrington said, they will be published with DMI 2.0,
which is slated to be introduced in March.

"Rolling those up into DMI 2.0 is going to provide a tight,
fully integrated, really powerful architecture,'' Arrington
said.

The next version of DMI includes several clarifications and
improvements, such as enhanced mapping technology and the addition
of an event model.

In addition, the DMTF this month will publish a formal product
registry that lists products that have undergone and passed
DMI-compliance tests.

The DMTF can be reached at http://www.dmtf.org or 503-264-9300.

SCO Unix to Get New Kernel

By:
EVAN SCHUMAN

Aiming to combine the best of two worlds for PC Unix users,
The Santa Cruz Operation Inc. is preparing a version of Unix
that will blend its popular OpenServer user interface and developer
tools with the guts of Novell Inc.'s UnixWare.

And though the project has the same code name-Gemini-as Novell's
former plan to merge UnixWare with NetWare at the microkernel,
SCO's strategy will abandon the so-called "SuperNOS" idea in
favor of a purer Unix approach, with NetWare technologies added
only for networking support.

Analysts and Unix OEMs said SCO's plan makes sense, and could
produce a server platform that carries with it a substantial
installed base and user familiarity, strong weapons in SCO's
battle with Microsoft Windows NT, the foremost competitor to
Unix in the Intel-based application server arena.

Tim Sheppard, PLC operating systems product manager in the server
system division at U.K.-based ICL, said he found the proposed
division of technologies for the merged Unix to be an ideal
combination.

"In terms of APIs [application programming interfaces] and in
terms of the user interface, I think it is a very logical way
of doing it," he said. "If it's done correctly, there is great
potential to get the best use of both."

Ever since the announcement last September that Novell would
sell Unix to Santa Cruz, Calif.-based SCO, technical managers
from both companies have been meeting to hammer out which elements
of their respective operating systems would survive in the
ultimate merged release, a product SCO plans to ship in early
1997.

The ultimate overriding concern was retaining existing independent
software vendor support, an area where SCO claimed a substantial
edge over Novell. SCO estimates that OpenServer has been outselling
UnixWare 2-to-1, with 12,000 applications shipping for Open
Server, compared with 850 for UnixWare, according to Jeff Ait,
SCO's vice president in charge of transition.

The strength of Novell's (and now SCO's) UnixWare is that it
is based on more advanced technology-namely, Unix System V
Release 4.2 (SVR4.2). SCO's OpenServer line was based on a
previous version of Unix, SVR3.2. So what SCO will combine
in the Gemini version of Unix, according to discussions with
SCO executives and Unix OEMs, are more advanced capabilities
of UnixWare. These include the SVR4.2-based kernel, as well
as its device drivers and multiprocessing support, security
and kernel-level threads, along with the attributes of OpenServer
that most attracted ISVs, such as its graphical user interface
and its systems administration tools. For years, SCO has opted
not to license any version of SVR4, preferring to stay with
the older license and replicating most of the SVR4 capabilities
with its own code. But the Novell deal changed all that, analysts
said.

"It sounds like they are really delivering on what they committed
to," said Tracy Corbo, a senior research analyst at International
Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. "They are actually taking this
to the next stage.

"The rules have changed. The whole game has changed," Corbo
said. SCO "now owns Unix" and the battle will be Microsoft
Windows NT versus Unix, rather than OpenServer versus UnixWare.

With Microsoft as a clear competitor, SCO's decision to go with
UnixWare's multiprocessor implementation is significant. NT
has been having difficulty scaling cleanly, as has NetWare,
while UnixWare has proven itself much more stable in high-end
Intel multiprocessor systems.

The lead SCO's OpenServer enjoys in third-party applications
support made the choice of an interface an easy one. "As a
platform, SCO was outselling UnixWare, so it would absolutely
make sense that they went with OpenServer as a GUI," said David
Watson, marketing manager at Informix Software Inc., one of
the largest UnixWare and OpenServer ISVs.

The change that SCO executives endorse most is the death of
Novell's SuperNOS concept. SuperNOS was a Novell proposal essentially
to merge UnixWare and NetWare using a microkernel approach.

SCO chief technical officer Doug Michels criticized the Novell
SuperNOS concept, saying Novell announced it before it figured
out how the concept would work. "They had a plan, which really
wasn't a plan: It was a goal," he said.

Although the next version of UnixWare integrates many of the more
popular features of NetWare-such as file, print and NetWare
Directory Services support, which also will be included in the
Gemini version of Unix-it falls far short of SuperNOS.

One of the reasons SCO is going out of its way to distance itself
from SuperNOS is because OEMs have told SCO that talk of SuperNOS
prompted several ISVs to hesitate to embrace the next version
of UnixWare.

Gerald Kerr, software product marketing manager at Unisys Corp.'s
Personal Computer division, a leading Unix OEM, said when Novell
first started talking up SuperNOS, "Unix users saw this tunnel.
And when these Unix users looked down the tunnel, they saw
these great big words: NetWare."

Kerr said users felt as if Novell was treating UnixWare as little
more than a migration for Unix users to move to NetWare.

With SCO, which has been championing Unix since its inception,
it is different, Kerr said. "Now those Unix users are starting
to look into the tunnel and they're seeing the word 'Unix,'
not 'UnixWare' or 'Unix Something Else.' "

Scott McGregor, SCO's senior vice president for products, said
although SCO will continue to use many NetWare capabilities,
the company is stopping short of claiming that one operating
system can handle everything equally well. "We're not saying
we're going to be as good at file and print," he said.

Compatibility Tools

SCO is also preparing a set of compatibility tools designed
to move users from the next UnixWare and OpenServer products
to Gemini. But the move won't be effortless.

"There's no way around the fact that OpenServer folks will have
to do some level of work" to port their applications to the
Gemini-merged Unix release, said Bob Sprowls, director of server
marketing at Unisys Corp., headquartered in Blue Bell, Pa.

TECH TRENDS: WEB INTERGRATION: CALL CENTERS GO ON-LINE

By:
MARGIE SEMILOF

A few network managers are looking to bring the same "page-pop"
principles used in computer-telephony applications to the Web.

Although industry pundits agree this is not a technology that
will take hold overnight, some managers of large call centers
believe they can extend their service offerings by giving on
line customers a way to speak directly to a service representative.

Robert MacRae at First Union Corp., a Charlotte, N.C., bank,
is one such manager. He wants to use Edify Corp.'s Electronic
Workforce application-development software to build Web applications
that give Individual Retirement Account customers a live agent
callback in response to a query from the Web.

First Union already operates a call center for 400,000 IRA customers,
as well as a Web site that posts information on the bank's
IRA services. It is looking for a way to bridge the two.

"Customers on the Internet get more information than those calling
in" on the voice-response unit, MacRae says. "But if someone
on the Web server has a question or a problem, we want them
to be able to click on a button and have their call transferred
to a representative, who can read from the same Web page."

Other managers also say they are interested in integrating call
centers with Web servers, though most aren't as far along in
plans.

"We are looking at ways to use live call-center reps to support
the provision of financial services on the Web," says Richard
Graham, vice president of telebanking administration at Signet
Banking Corp., Richmond, Va. "As to how that is done, we will
experiment. This [Edify] may be part of the answer, or our
answer may be as simple as a fax back or E-mail in response
to a question."

"We are just now looking into making our products available
to the public on the Internet," says Greg Johnston, manager
of integrated networks at Household Credit Services, Salinas,
Calif. "This Web call-center idea does pose interesting possibilities."

Edify's Solution

Edify, a Santa Clara, Calif., software developer, is doing its
best to make it as intriguing as possible. The company patented
an element to its Electronic Workforce application development
software last November that delivers what it calls "Web telephony
integration."

"In the long term, I think, this has a chance to redefine call
centers,'' says Charles Jolissant, Edify's chief technology
officer.

Electronic Workforce uses smart software agents to build interactive
response systems. Electronic Workforce sits on an IBM OS/2
server. The server sits on the network between phones and a
Web server. Edify officials say versions for additional platforms
also are in the works.

The telephony-integration software creates a Web session for
the call-center agent, giving the agent access to the same
information as the customer. Edify is also looking at ways
for the customer and agent to share information on-line.

Target applications include anywhere users browsing a Web page
may want additional information. For example, catalog shoppers
logged into a Web server may see an interesting item, but they
may find that the Web page does not answer all of their questions.

Developers can place a "call-me" button on the page that, once
clicked, alerts an agent from the catalog company's call center.
Moments later the agent can call the customer to help close
the sale.

Linking Mechanisms

There are two basic technical components that make it possible
to link a Web server to a PBX. The first is telephone control,
which is handled through computer-telephony-integration software
such as Northern Telecom Inc.'s Meridian Link or AT&T's ASAI
software-on the PBX.

But there also must be a way to get transaction information
to the call-center agent's desktop. One way is to develop a
custom application. Another is to use a Web browser to go through
the Electronic Workforce for the transaction information.

Despite this early enthusiasm for linking Web sites to call
centers, analysts said they are skeptical about the approach's
viability any time soon. They cite numerous unresolved technical
problems, Internet-related and otherwise.

"One issue is how do you establish a phone call and live link
to the screen, since the target customer is probably a consumer
with one phone line," says David Goodtree, an analyst at Forrester
Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based consulting company.

The Internet itself poses several problems, says Bart Stuck,
president of Business Strategies, a Westport, Conn., consulting
company.

"The Internet is an unmanaged network and callback times are
likely to be unpredictable," he says. "Can the Web provide
the quality of service someone with a customer-service application
is looking for, or are you better off with something that is
private and dedicated?"

Some users with sophisticated call centers are also skeptical.

At Holiday Inn Worldwide, Atlanta, customers can reserve hotel
rooms via the Holiday Inn Web site. Les Ottolinghi, director
of emerging technologies at the hotel chain, says giving customers
access to an on-line chat room is a better way to answer their
questions than having them switch to a telephone.

"Using intelligent agents to search a database is more important,"
Ottolinghi says. "If for some reason a customer has to talk
to a person, they are better off going right to the call center
in the first place."

Frame-Relay Bargain Hunt

By:
JOHN RENDLEMAN

Looking for a frame-relay bargain? Now may be the best time
for some shrewd negotiating, industry experts say.

That's because it's still unclear whether an FCC mandate for
carriers to file tariffs for frame-relay services, starting
next month, will crimp their ability to cut good deals.

Already fierce competition among long-distance carriers has
put users in the driver's seat. But with service providers
offering complicated incentives, discounts and special offers,
users must carefully consider frame-relay service contracts,
industry experts said.

For frame-relay service "customers are knowledgeable enough
to get a good deal, but the shopping process is so complex
that getting the best deal is difficult,'' according to Steven
Taylor, president of Distributed Networking Associates, a Greensboro,
N.C., consulting company.

GAB Robins North America Inc. got a favorable frame-relay deal
from Sprint a year ago, after carefully renegotiating the rates
and terms of Sprint's standard frame-relay contract, said Carl
Longo, director of telecommunications at the Parsippany, N.J.
based insurance company.

"Since then, when I've talked to other potential Sprint frame
relay customers, they hadn't thought of a lot of things I told
them to think about,'' Longo said. "They don't look at the
terms of the contract very closely. They just look at the standard
agreement and sign on the bottom line.''

Customers who use competition to their advantage can negotiate
up-front financial credits, substantial discounts off carriers'
standard rates, initial waivers of minimum volume commitments,
free installation and free service for an initial month or
more, according to attorneys at Levine, Blaszak, Block & Boothby,
a Washington law firm that helps large companies negotiate
telecommunications-service contracts.

"If I had to give potential frame-relay customers one piece
of advice, it would be to use the market,'' said James Blaszak,
a partner at the law firm. "The only way to figure out where
frame-relay prices bottom out is to use competitive bids.''

As an example of the competitive environment, MCI Communications
Corp. often gives users with small-to-medium-sized networks
free installation and volume and term discounts ranging from
4 percent to 30 percent, said William Callahan, senior manager
of broadband data marketing at MCI.

A second level of higher but unspecified discounts offered by
MCI on a customer-specific basis kicks in if a customer spends
anywhere from around $15,000 a month or more on frame-relay
or if the customer has a substantial amount of other traffic
on MCI's network, according to Callahan.

Three Months' Free Service

In addition, MCI offers up to three months of free service for
customers who want to try frame-relay service or who want to
compare MCI's frame-relay service in a side-by-side test against
another carrier's, according to Callahan.

Sprint has a different approach, trying to avoid promotional
rates, said Brad Hokamp, director of advanced data services
at Sprint, although he added that "in specific cases, there
will be times when we are pressed to do that.''

Sprint's volume and term discounts, which range from 5 percent
to 30 percent, are part of its standard frame-relay rates and
will be included in Sprint's frame-relay tariff once the FCC's
tariff rules take effect, Hokamp said.

"The price level overall in the [frame-relay] marketplace will
decline a certain percentage in the next one to two years,''
Hokamp said. Once the tariff rules are in place, however, "there
will be a decline in the number of special deals that you will
see, but it won't be significant,'' he said.

Although officials at AT&T and LDDS WorldCom, the network-services
division of Worldcom Inc., Jackson, Miss., declined to comment
on their frame-relay incentives, evidence suggests that they,
too, offer lower prices to compete for specific customers.

'Very Aggressive'

"AT&T was very aggressive in their pricing strategy with us,''
said Bob Beck, director of enabling technology services at
Inacom Corp., an Omaha, Neb.-based provider of computer and
communications systems and services.

Inacom received "a very agreeable discount'' on AT&T's standard
rates, Beck said. Although Beck declined to provide an exact
figure, "the number is very competitive with the numbers we
received from their competitors,'' he said.

Today's environment of secrecy about frame-relay rates is expected
to end next month, when service providers will tariff their
frame-relay transport services to comply with a recent FCC
decision classifying frame-relay as a basic service that must
be tariffed.

Public Record

Although industry analysts differ on whether tariffing will
help or hurt frame-relay customers, they agree it will provide
a public record of the carriers' standard rates. And though
carriers still will be able to make special deals, the rates
contained in those deals will have to be tariffed individually,
the analysts said.

That could either hurt customers, by making the providers reluctant
to lower their rates beyond a certain level, or help customers,
by letting them compare rates paid by other customers in similar
situations.

For now, Levine, Blaszak, Block & Boothby advises clients to
disregard carriers' quoted rates for frame-relay service because
savvy customers, especially those with larger networks, can
save substantially by negotiating individual deals.

Limited-time promotions are also of questionable value, because
they don't reduce the rates a customer pays for the life of
a contract, attorneys at the firm said.

Looking to the bottom line, the law firm advises potential frame
relay customers to seek bids from numerous providers, compare
actual rates and keep contract terms to a minimum in case frame
relay rates continue to decrease.

Buying Into Objects -- Illustra will give Informix key database
technology

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

With its acquisition of Illustra Information Technologies Inc.,
Informix Software Inc. could leapfrog giants Oracle Corp.,
IBM and Sybase Inc. in the race to integrate management of
multimedia data objects in networked environments.

Through the acquisition, announced late last month and valued
at more than $400 million, Informix gained technology that
lets users create, store, manage and analyze complex data types,
such as images, audio, video and World Wide Web documents in
traditional relational database management systems.

Although the user base of such data is somewhat specialized,
the potential market has spurred other leading database vendors
to claim they, too, will be able to support similar functionality
in the near future.

Oracle, Redwood Shores, Calif., has already committed itself
to an object-relational model with its next-generation database,
Oracle8 (CommWeek, Aug. 21), while IBM is working on adding
new data types to DB2.

And Sybase Inc., Emeryville, Calif., has been quietly researching
adding object management to RDBMS server technology for four
years, according to company insiders.

Officials at Informix and Illustra said the Universal Server,
a merged object-relational database combining the technologies
of the two companies, would be delivered by the end of 1996.

Sanjeev Barma, research director for the Gartner Group Inc.
in Stamford, Conn., sees the ability to customize data types
and processes as the most important part of the object-relational
paradigm.

"Object-relational technology is going to be for 'Type A' companies
very aggressive ones that do much of their own programming,"
he said.

What Illustra lacks is what Informix has: on-line transaction
processing capabilities, multithreading, scalability to multiple
parallel-processing servers, enterprise-level reliability and
about 25 percent of the existing Unix-based relational database
market.

'Good Complement'

"Informix is a good complement to Illustra in that [Informix]
is highly scalable, reliability-tuned and massively parallel,"
said Linda Dozier, chief technologist at America Online Inc.'s
NaviSoft Inc. division in Santa Barbara, Calif. NaviSoft is
Illustra's biggest customer, using the Illustra Server as the
driving engine for AOL's Naviserver Web server.

"With AOL's on-line users growing at 30 percent per month, we
need that scalability," Dozier said.

The particular segments of the market that Oakland, Calif.-based
Illustra may add to Informix include the image and multimedia
management sectors. Illustra extends the search capabilities
to include the contents of images, rather than just the text
keys that have been entered along with images.

"From what I've read of Oracle8, it can't search within the
[multimedia] data types," said Steve Sommer, vice president
of marketing at Informix, Menlo Park, Calif. "We will be able
to search for images similar to a given image, with searches
based upon color, form and text."

Another Illustra user, Larry White, publisher of Hyperzine,
a World Wide Web-based magazine for professional photographers,
uses both Illustra's Web Data Blade and fuzzy search engine
in his implementation of Hyperzine.

"People can do a fuzzy search on the word camcorder and come
up with a review of a palmcorder, even though the review did
not contain the word camcorder," White said. White is not yet
using the image-form search capabilities of the Illustra database.

A Question of Meshing

In bringing these capabilities to an Informix product, the underlying
question for Informix and Illustra engineers may be one of
how readily the two companies' technologies will mesh.

"Before the acquisition, engineers from both of our companies
did a great deal of work to validate that our code bases could
be married together," said Bruce Gordon, vice president of
marketing at Illustra. "We feel very confident that we'll be
able to bring in the combined product by the end of the year."

"It's not a slam dunk," said Herb Edelstein, a partner at Euclid
Associates in Potomac, Md. "Each of these products has lots
of details and lots of events that must occur over the next
year before a merged product can come out." When it does, he
said, it will be "way ahead of Oracle8."

Oracle's Ken Jacobs, vice president of product strategies for
server products, would not give a time frame on the delivery
of Oracle8, but said "development is going along very well."

He also said Oracle is working on ways for the user to create
new data types in a way that is less intrusive than Illustra's
current methods.

"We don't consider it very robust to have to bring down a database
in order to add a new data type, as you have to do with Illustra,"
he said. "We feel the user should just be able to create a
new data type with a 'create-data-type' statement, the same
way they currently do to create a new table."

Study Critiques New Mail Systems

By:
JEFFREY SCHWARTZ

As many network managers choose new electronic-mail platforms
this year, they likely will discover that next-generation systems
from IBM, Microsoft Corp. and Novell Inc. are far from ideal
as enterprise-messaging backbones, according to a report published
late last month.

IBM's Lotus Notes Server, the Microsoft Exchange Server and
Novell's GroupWise XTD Server are new client/server-based-platforms
that provide marked improvements over aging earlier LAN-based
messaging systems, the "Decision 96" report from Rapport Communication
Inc. said. Rapport is a Washington consultancy specializing
in messaging systems.

Microsoft, Novell and IBM, through its acquisition of Lotus
Development Corp., sell the lion's share of LAN-based E-mail
systems. But although they supportindustry standards and offer
workgroup-computing features,all three emerging platforms will
vary and all have room for improvement, analysts said.

For instance, all three are weak when used in heterogeneous
messaging environments, said Rapport analysts, who gathered
their data from briefings with vendors and beta users.

Client and server directory structures on all platforms work
fine until connected to other E-mail platforms, said Gary Rowe
a Rapport principal. But none of the three products supports
true X.500 directory services at a protocol level.

IBM Scores Higher

Although Microsoft's and Novell's support for X.500 directory
services were considered insufficient, IBM received better
marks because of Lotus' expected support for native X.500 protocols
in its forthcoming Lotus Message Switch, said Dan Blum, a Rapport
consultant.

Officials from IBM and Microsoft could not be reached for comment
last week, but a Novell spokesman said the information about
GroupWise appeared to be accurate. Rapport analysts advised
network managers to run exhaustive pilots on more than one
system.

"I don't see a one-size-fits-all [solution] to messaging, but
the vendors that win out will be those that provide plug-and
play connectivity in heterogeneous shops," said Steve Cropper,
director of messaging systems at Charles Schwab & Co., a San
Francisco brokerage firm that is migrating 8,000 users off
of a host-based messaging system.

Most industry experts said they expect IBM, Microsoft and Novell
to remain the dominant suppliers of LAN-based E-mail software,
but there are competitive products from Banyan Systems Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Netscape Communications
Corp. worthy of consideration.

Lotus Notes 4.0 and Microsoft Exchange are expected to ship
early this year; Novell has said it expects to ship GroupWise
XTD in the second quarter.

The 130-page report critically analyzes the three platforms
and is available for $395.

Rapport can be reached at 513-777-4529.

Banyan Banking on Back-to-Basics Strategy

By:
SHARON FISHER

Users of Banyan Systems Inc.'s Vines say they are are hoping
the company's new "back-to-basics" approach will allow them
to hang on to their Banyan networks and the advantages they
offer.

John Curtis, senior vice president of Banyan's enterprise networks
division, said last week that this year the company will concentrate
more on enhancing and supporting its current line of products
and will focus less on vision statements.

Some users had been concerned about previous Banyan statements
that had left them with the impression that the company was
not committed to Vines, Curtis said.

"There'll be no more talk about 'Vines is dead' and there'll
be not as much talk, but more action," he said. "You won't
see us pronouncing grand visions."

As part of that plan, the company intends to release in the
next two or three quarters a new version of Vines will be easier
to use and that is better integrated with Windows NT (CommWeek,
Nov. 6, 1995)

Mixed Reviews

Analysts said Banyan's new strategy, which was outlined at news
meetings last month, is a solid move.

"They're pedaling as fast as they can from a development standpoint,
building on their core competency," said Glenn Gabriel Ben
Yosef, president of Clear Thinking Research Inc., a Boston
consultancy.

Users said they hoped the reorganization would help Banyan because
Vines offers features that are not provided by any other network
operating system. But the same users were not necessarily confident
about the future.

"As it is right now, there is still only one choice for an enterprise
network, and unfortunately I don't think Banyan realizes it,"
noted Gary Wescom, a computer systems engineer for Pacific
Gas & Electric Co., San Francisco. PG&E has some 20,000 PCs
on its Vines network.

"There are some things that companies, like PG&E, can't do without
the services of a network operating system like Banyan's, and
it doesn't appear that Microsoft is going to be able to provide
it very quickly," Wescom said. "We were looking at a pretty
scary time. Banyan had shown an interest in basically going
away-that was all the signs we were seeing-and to have them
still out there trying to continue on at least gives us the
feeling that we'll be able to keep our Banyan network operating
until something else comes along.

"But," he continued, "it's hard to have a whole lot of confidence
of Banyan withstanding the Microsoft onslaught for very long,
even if it is a superior product."

Other Banyan users said they were preparing for a future where
Vines would be integrated with other NOSs, such as Microsoft's
Windows NT.

Clinging to Vines

"I've invested in Vines, so I have a deep desire [that Banyan
survive], but at the same time we are doing everything we can
to integrate other Windows NT networks in with Vines," said
Eddie Albert, project manager of Banyan network operations
for the U.S. Air Force at the Pentagon. He is responsible for
251 Vines servers, and said he thinks the Air Force as a whole
which is integratingits bases worldwide-has 500 to 1,000 Vines
servers.

"Windows NT is a very good LAN and a very good file server,
but for the underlying backbone I would still use Banyan's
Vines, and that's the way I'm setting my networks up," Albert
said.

Banyan's Curtis said the new strategy is an extension of a company
wide reorganization last year that also included appointing
John Paul to head a division focused on Internet services (CommWeek,
Nov. 13, 1995)

"We've got good technology, but we haven't been focused on bringing
it into the modern world, on making Vines more friendly and
bringing Windows NT into it," Curtis said. "We had a lot of
things running at cross-purposes when it was a monolithic organization.
What John Paul and his people are doing requires a turn on
a dime; what we do is a consistent story and predictable path.
We were getting to where we weren't doing either one very well."

Keeping Customers Happy

Will Banyan still be an independent company by the end of this
year? "I can't disagree with that being a good question," Curtis
said. "If somebody big wants to acquire us, I think our customers
would say 'fine.' That's really my measure-are the customers
happy?"

Interview: Directing IBM's Server Strategy


Nicholas Donofrio is one of the most influential executives
in the server industry. Reporting directly to IBM chairman
and CEO Lou Gerstner, 29-year IBM veteran Donofrio oversees
all server activity at IBM, including mainframes, the AS/400,
the RS/6000 Unix workstations and a line of Intel-based PC
servers.

His current title is senior vice president and group executive,
but Donofrio began his career at IBM as a designer of semiconductor
chips.

Recently, Communications-Week editor at large Evan Schuman met
with Donofrio at IBM's headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., for a
wide-ranging discussion of server issues. Here are some excerpts.

CommWeek: The Internet and multimedia applications are placing
unprecedented demands on hardware. How is this demand affecting
IBM's development of Internet and video servers?

Donofrio: In the final analysis, the power is in the bandwidth,
the I/O capability and the storage of most of these servers,
not necessarily in the processor. The exception is numerically
intensive processes, which need the processor to give all of
the answers. But that's not what the rest of the world is driven
by. That's probably not what the Internet is driven by. That's
not what multimedia is really driven by. It's just driven by
bandwidth and storage capability.

All of these servers are trying to grow up-to go from megabytes
to gigabytes to terabytes to petabytes. All of them need faster
channel and I/O structure. All of them have to get multiple
gigabit channel access to keep up with the demands-either multimedia
or data-in all kinds of forms. And they need the ability to
feed thousands of people in this very, very far-flung thing
we call the Internet.

Right now, people tolerate "server down, server busy, no access."
In the future that'll be less tolerated.

CommWeek: Are they tolerating it? Conventional wisdom today
has many users not returning to sites where they get repeated
busy signals.

Donofrio: Well, that depends on how badly you need the answer,
doesn't it? If you're browsing, I agree with you. Don't go
back. But that's not going to work if it's a transaction you
want to complete; if we're putting real commerce on the Internet.
Then it's not going to be "don't go back." You need to go back.
You started the transaction. You want to complete it or you
want whatever those goods or services are at the other end.

Not going back is not going to work as we get to electronic
commerce. We're going to need something more reliable, something
more predictable and something more deliverable. That's what
people are working on, trying to make these things more industrial
strength, along with security.

CommWeek: A recent trend is the proliferation of specialized
ser-vers, for electronic mail and Internet and other applications.
Do you see this continuing?

Donofrio: Depending on your size and scale, maybe you can have
four or five servers in your business. But when four or five
servers become 50 or 100 servers, that's a chore.

People are consolidating. One very simple example is how SP2
has gone into large businesses as a file or as a server consolidation
system. People just collect 50, 60, 100 servers, put them inside
an SP2 frame or two, and then manage them all from the same
physical point-all with the same system software. That's a
cost statement for a lot of our customers. They can't keep
up with a server a month for this or for that. And I don't
think a server a month is going to be in the future.

CommWeek: So you don't think there's a trend toward more specialized
servers?

Donofrio: No.

I think that during the last couple of years, that's what's
happened. But I think it is reversing now. Again, it depends
on the business or a small business, maybe two or three specialized
servers is all they need.

CommWeek: What about replicated sites? Or small branch offices
where users want an isolated E-mail server?

Donofrio: That works for some period of time. But what happens
when the server is the limiter? Suppose you have a server handling
500 people. When you're above that limit, replication is the
answer and you can stick gateways between the two so that they
can communicate. That's fine as long as you just don't need
more than 500 people interacting at the same time. But there
are lots of applications where you need tens of thousands of
people to interact at the same time.

The world can't just take what you've got and build replications
and put gateways in place. Res-ervations systems will not work
in that way. Large transaction, financial clearing systems
won't work that way. If the business has to close its books
every night, it won't work that way.

CommWeek: How would you describe the changed uses of mainframes?

Donofrio: More people are trying to use them as a central server.
We're trying to change our image and we're trying to change
the nomenclature, but we're not foolish. These 390 servers
still do the highest logical form of computing.

More people are using them for repositories. Whether they are
repositories of data the way we understand it today, or whether
it's more complex forms of data such as multimedia mixed with
regular data, they like the fact that it has all the bandwidth,
all the interconnectivity. They like the fact that it has the
systems management abilities.

CommWeek: Are there any mainframe applications that you've seen
disappearing over the past couple of years?

Donofrio: I think it's a matter of scale and some people can
get the job done with something that's different, that's smaller.
In some cases, they may be better serviced with a PC server
or an RS/6000 server. In a lot of cases, the applications aren't
available on a System 390.

CommWeek: A lot of users say there's too much capability on
the desktop, with servers relatively underutilized. Do you
agree?

Donofrio: We see a lot of that and you're going to see even
more of it. People are tired of trying to manage it. They're
tired of the costs and the questionable return on the investment.
And they know one size doesn't fit everybody in their business.
Not everybody needs the world's most powerful desktop or workstation.

We'll never go away from graphical user interface front ends
and things of that nature. But people are trying to figure
out what they're getting for the buck. There's always going
to be a balance.

ATM Gear to Support SVC -- StrataCom to emphasize extemporaneous
connections, security for ATM switches

By:
ERIC LACH

StrataCom Inc. will begin shipping software for its asynchronous
transfer mode switches next week to support switched virtual
connections.

SVCs let users build up and tear down connections on demand,
providing considerable savings over permanent virtual connections,
the other common means of connection for ATM.

Although StrataCom is not the first company to announce SVC
support on its ATM switches, it is the first major switch vendor
to do so. Analysts claim SVCs are key to ATM's long-term value.

"If ATM doesn't have the ability to support these casual collaborative
relationships, it is going to be tough to achieve the benefits
we think we will get out of ATM," said Tom Nolle, president
of Cimi Corp., a Voorhees, N.J., consultancy.

Other Selling Points

Users are likely to welcome the economies that SVCs offer.

"Right now we are using only PVCs because that is the only thing
we can get from both our switch vendors and carrier," said
John Steedman, an electronics engineer in the NASA communications
division at the Goddard Space Flight Center, located in Greenbelt,
Md.

Steedman said he has had problems with PVCs, particularly the
variable bit rate PVCs, because they steal resources whether
or not they are in use.

"SVCs would be a real advantage to us so that we could tear
down some of these VBR PVCs when we do not need them,'' Steedman
said.

StrataCom officials confirmed that the announcement would be
made this week.

Security Assurances

Sources said the company will offer ATM signaling and security
features to give users better control over SVCs on their ATM
networks. One key feature is support for both source- and destination
address screening, which lets users specify port by port a
list of ATM addresses for which they can receive or initiate
SVC calls.

StrataCom "is trying to address some of the security issues
that come with SVCs, because an SVC is like an ATM telephone
number-a dial-up call," Nolle said. "One problem with SVCs
is that someone who knows your ATM calling ID could breach
your network security because you might be running applications
that don't know they are using SVCs, and don't protect against
intrusion."

Some protection is considered mandatory for public networks
where many different companies are connected to the same ATM
service, giving them access to each other's ATM connected devices.

In addition to offering its own security safeguards, StrataCom,
San Jose, Calif., has said it will add more ATM security mechanisms,
such as those under consideration by the ATM Forum's new security
working group, once those specifications are available.

StrataCom's SVC software is available as a system upgrade. It
complies with the ATM User-to-Network Interface specification.
The ATM SVC signaling scheme also conforms to both ATM UNI
3.0 and 3.1 and provides a translation between these standards.

The company also will support ATM SVC signaling for the ATM
Frame UNI and ATM Inverse Multiplexed interfaces when they
are delivered early this year.

StrataCom is also expected to announce support for the Interim
Inter-Switch Signaling Protocol, which provides interoperability
between multiple vendors' ATM switches and the Interim Local
Management Interface protocol for ATM connection management.

Congress Continues To Tinker With Bill

By:
MARK ROCKWELL

Landmark telecommunications legislation was put on hold until
after the budget crunch is resolved, but that didn't stop some
final tinkering on the bill by legislators late last month.

Although Congress adjourned at the end of December without acting
on the legislation, lawmakers negotiated and crafted a bill
that can be acted on quickly when it does comes up for a vote.
In recent weeks, conference committee members managed to get
the long distance and local telephone industries' support for
the legislation by granting limited concessions on key issues.

The recent alterations would increase government supervision
of Bell company entry into long distance and allow the Bell
companies to jointly market local and long distance services.
Legislators also decided to keep language that allows states
to continue their individual price-cap initiatives, according
to Capitol Hill sources.

Unresolved Issues

The work puts the finishing touches on the telecommunications
issues in the bill, but leaves more contentious broadcast issues,
mainly foreign ownership of stations, to be addressed. Both
the long distance and local telephone lobbying forces have
given a "grudging OK" to the bill, according to one long distance
lobbyist.

Initial language in the bill concerning the entry of the Bell
companies into long distance gave the FCC the decision-making
role in that process, but relegated the Department of Justice
to an advisory role (CommWeek, Dec. 18, 1995)

Before adjournment, the committee put greater weight behind
the Justice Department's simple advisory role, indicating that
Justice's opinion should be given "substantial weight" in any
decision made by the FCC.

"It's very important that they're back in the picture. It could
create a situation where the FCC is embarrassed into doing
something," said Jeffrey Kagan, president of Kagan Telecom
Associates, an Atlanta consulting company.

The Bell companies got the OK to jointly market local and long
distance services, something that was precluded in the original
language of the joint bill.

"That got the Bell companies on board," the lobbyist said.

Depending upon whom you talk to, the bill could either be passed
early this week or at the end of the month. A spokesman for
the Senate Commerce Committee said that if enough signatures
could be collected on the conference committee report, the
bill could be approved by Tuesday.

The House side holds the key to the bill, however, and observers
there said representatives are more guarded in their assessment
of the bill's timing.

New Year Ushers In More Urgent Role for Nets

By:
THE COMMWEEK STAFF

With the new year comes the promise of new products and technologies
that will let corporate networks take on a more critical role
in how business is conducted.

Key to this transformation of the corporate network from information
utility to strategic resource will be the Internet and Internet
related technologies. But they certainly won't be the only
driving force; corporate network managers will grapple with
a variety of other technologies and industry issues, such as
consolidation and new levels of competition in the telecommunications
market.

First drawn to the Internet and World Wide Web by the hype surrounding
it in 1995, network managers are expected to play a crucial
role in moving already established Internet connections to
a new level, using several new classes of products.

"Today we have generic software tools with base-level functionality,"
said Steve Franco, research analyst with the Yankee Group,
Boston. "In 1996 we'll see tools that add value and improve
existing business processes, like increased groupware functionality
for Internet software."

By the end of the year, many of those applications will include
encryption and digital signature techniques, which will let
users secure their communications. Companies will be able to
rely on more than firewalls to provide point-to-point encryption,
Franco said.

Also of particular importance will be a means to secure corporate
networks, especially those with an on-line presence. This likely
will induce businesses to use outside Web service bureaus,
which now host 50 percent of all commercial Web pages.

Web authoring and management tools will continue to gain momentum,
as applications accessed over the Web become more interactive.

As media buyers become accustomed to the Web, they increasingly
will seek to spread out expenditures to reach the specialized
audience segments that can be delivered reliably via the Web.

About $12.4 million was spent on paid HyperText links between
October and December alone, according to WebTrack Inc., a New
York-based market research company.

No doubt this amount will continue to grow at an exponential
rate as the pieces are put in place during 1996 to make electronic
commerce a reality.

Also, look for third-party auditing services to hammer out ways
to adequately track activity on a Web site.

Like the Internet, electronic mail will continue to gain acceptance.
Although Microsoft Exchange and the Lotus Message Switch will
be available this year, organizations will not make the move
overnight. Many are likely to pilot the new systems as well
as others, including Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Open Mail and Novell
Inc.'s GroupWise XTD.

E-Mail Possibilities

Because of the distributed nature of organizations, many shops
are likely to use a variety of E-mail clients and servers.

"People are going to start to understand how badly they need
directory services,'' said Terry McCarthy, president of New
York-based systems integrator Neoterik.

Also, as evidenced last year, messaging will become a core function
of collaborative computing systems and Web browsers, several
analysts said.

The Internet Engineering Task Force's newest version of the
Remote Monitoring specification will help that cause. The next
version, RMON2, expected to be completed this month, will boost
RMON's capabilities, letting network managers gather information
about network traffic at the application layer.

Leading network management platform vendors also are expected
to deliver their next-generation platforms.

Indeed, HP is aiming for the first half of 1996 for the rollout
of its fully distributed version of OpenView. The new version
enables the graphical user interfaces to be off-loaded onto
individual workstations while main-

taining one workstation as the Network Node Manager server.

Sun Microsystems Inc. has promised that its fourth iteration
of Solstice Enterprise Manager will ship this year; the commercial
version of the distributed management platform, which will
include object-oriented capabilities, will be available in
the second half of 1996.

Although some technologies will be regarded with skepticism,
others, such as ISDN and frame-relay, will continue to be adopted
en masse, according to experts.

"Frame-relay service is probably going to experience the same
tremendous amount of growth that it did in the last year,"
said Beth Gage, broadband consultant at TeleChoice Inc., a
Verona, N.J., consultancy. "Remote-LAN connectivity is probably
the largest application for frame-relay networks and that probably
won't change for awhile."

Slow Growth for ATM

The use of asynchronous transfer mode service for wide-area
connections is not expected to grow dramatically in the coming
year, although the planned introduction during 1996 of frame
relay-to-ATM service interworking by providers will let users
with frame-relay networks adopt ATM at high-speed sites, analysts
said.

"Interworking is a key issue for ATM," Gage said. "Interworking
will help ATM get off the ground, although we don't think 1996
is going to be the year for ATM."

Also during the year, FCC rules that require service providers
to tariff their frame-relay services probably will take effect,
although it's difficult to predict what the impact of tariffing
will be on frame-relay rates, observers said.

In the protocol arena, analysts said they expect to see more
consolidation in the TCP/IP software vendor arena, as competition
grows among companies that want to provide applications that
run over operating systems' native stacks.

More often than not, users will opt to use the stack that comes
with the operating system, and look for bells and whistles
elsewhere.

IBM is expected to make its proprietary operating systems more
open by enhancing its TCP/IP offerings, including offering
upgraded versions of its TCP/IP for MVS. The company may also
soup up its OS/2 Warp operating system with new TCP/IP features.

In the network operating systems area, Novell's plan for the
year is to focus on networking, its core competency. It will
also continue to compete with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT,
and, in particular, will encourage applications developers
and users to look on its NetWare Directory Services as an enterprise
wide, industry-standard directory.

"I think how [Novell's reorganization] plays out next year is
Novell really focuses their attention on keeping their installed
base, and driving NDS and NetWare services to become de facto
standards," said Jon Oltsik, an analyst at Forrester Research
Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., consultancy.

For Banyan Systems Inc., the future is more problematic. "1996
is the 'do-or-die' year in terms of continuing to permeate
this idea of enterprise network services, and leverage StreetTalk
as an Internet directory or a corporate directory," said Mike
Rothman, vice president of the Meta Group Inc., a Reston, Va.,
consultancy.

Continued Acquisitions

Analysts predict the consolidation frenzy will continue in 1996.
In particular, they said, look for Cisco Systems Inc. to continue
making acquisitions.

3Com Corp.'s acquisitive mood may be diminished, however, because
of the difficulties it has had bringing Chipcom into its fold,
but Cabletron Systems Inc. and Bay Networks Inc. can be expected
to fill out their product lines or develop their customer base
or channels to market through small tactical purchases.

Even more turmoil can be expected in the telecommunications
market-with or without national telecommunications reform legislation.
But if the pending bill is signed into law, the telecommunications
industry will begin anew.

Getting Ready

All parties with a stake in the telecom market have been making
quiet preparations to enter into an intense battle.

For instance, AT&T's strategy is to use an existing structure
to enter the local services market. It is anticipating entering
local telecom markets this year and has even assigned sales
figures to some of its executives for 1996 that go beyond Ameritech's
Chicago and Grand Rapids, Mich., local competition trials.

If the telecommunications bill doesn't make it past President
Clinton's desk, state initiatives will carry the deregulatory
trend forward.

Blending Tech Into OpenDoc

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

The melding of Taligent Inc.'s compound document framework into
IBM's OpenDoc cross-platform, object-development environment
should give network managers wider access to more complex objects.

The Taligent technology will start to appear in IBM's Open Class
library next month, giving developers the ability to use it
to generate OpenDoc or Object Linking and Embedding parts,
said Jon Slitz, vice president of object technology marketing
at IBM.

The company is looking at a variety of ways to weave the Taligent
technology into the Open Class libraries and make it CORBA
2.0 compliant, according to IBM executives.

IBM took over Taligent as a wholly owned subsidiary last month
after a four-year venture with Apple Computer Inc. and Hewlett
Packard Co. The three companies formed the Cupertino, Calif.
based Taligent in 1991 to develop an object-oriented development
environment and operating system for the next generation of
PCs and workstations.

In addition to giving details about the role Taligent technology
will play in IBM's overall object strategy, IBM executives
said IBM will use its System Object Model (SOM) to capture
Microsoft Corp.'s OLE custom-control (OCX) component technology
for use in multiplatform environments. The company also outlined
future plans for its DB2 database.

Users of IBM's object solutions expressed disappointment about
the failure of the Taligent initiative and wondered if integrating
Taligent's compound-document framework was the right course
to take.

"I would have been more excited if IBM was defining a business
process engine rather than a compound-document engine," said
David Taylor, president of Enterprise Engines Inc., San Mateo,
Calif. "IBM has brought objects to the mainframe, which takes
the MIS guys out of a terrible conflict, but they just haven't
delivered on the [Taligent and OpenDoc] stuff," he said.

Taylor is more enthusiastic about the prospects of IBM's SOM
technology embracing OCX. "I heartily endorse that. OCXs are
brain-dead, in my opinion, and they will give the world a bad
impression of object technology. But, within a SOM wrapper,
they can become truly object-oriented, taking on polymorphism
and inheritance, and that would be great."

IBM's Slitz said, "You'll see from us a way to use OCXs in concert
with SOM, and they will be more robust in the sense that they
will be able to run in cross-platform environments. This is
part of IBM's continuing recognition that OLE exists in the
marketplace. We will create high-value ways of integrating
OLE into larger environments."

Future Plans

IBM also will bring its object technology to the World Wide
Web, developing a common application programming interface
to interface SOM objects with network middleware layers that
will bond the Web to back-end and legacy applications. In 1996,
IBM also will bring distributed naming and directory services
to the Web and expand its compound document architecture to
new data types, including coded and non-coded information.
"You will also see Java-based applications from IBM this year,"
Slitz said.

DB2 Expansions

IBM's plans for DB2 this year will include a growing number
of user-defined data types, according to Tim Negris, an IBM
vice president.

"In 1996, we will add to DB2 something called Cubic Query, or
querying based upon the contents of an image," he said.

For the real number crunchers, IBM will come out with a financial
modeling tool, called a Differential Equation Blaster.Negris
said that IBM, along with consulting service partners, would
introduce several data-mining applications.

WorldCom Extends Frame-Relay Services

By:
JOHN RENDLEMAN

LDDS WorldCom will expand its frame-relay network-to-network
interface service to Europe through agreements with undisclosed
European service providers this quarter.

The expansion will open another avenue for users to extend their
frame-relay networks globally.

In addition, LDDS WorldCom has extended its domestic WilPak
frame-relay network-to-network (NNI) capability to 10 additional
U.S. cities. During the first half of this year, the company
plans to continue an aggressive effort to extend its NNI reach,
said Emily Hansen, frame-relay product manager at LDDS WorldCom,
the network service division of WorldCom Inc., Jackson, Miss.

This will be an easy way for LDDS WorldCom "to expand its international
frame-relay coverage," said Tim Burke, an analyst at the Yankee
Group, a Boston consulting company.

For overseas connections, "NNI allows us to partner with another
company whose deployment of switches is denser than our own,"
Hansen said.

With LDDS WorldCom's NNI offering, customers connect localized
or regional sites using short-haul frame-relay circuits provided
by their local service providers. They connect the regional
frame-relay network to more distant sites through a physical
NNI connection to LDDS WorldCom's frame-relay network, the
company said.

Domestically, customers of LDDS WorldCom's NNI service pay standard
rates for the long distance portion of their networks, plus
the tariffed rate charged by the local provider for regional
frame-relay connections and a monthly fee for each 64 kilobit
per-second increment of capacity on the NNI connection.

In Brief: TELCO MEGA-MERGERS IN STORE?


Merger rumors continued late last week as Congress inched closer
to agreeing on the telecommunications bill that would allow
long distance, local telephone and cable companies to compete.
Rumors of AT&T's buying out GTE Corp. and of Bell Atlantic
Corp.'s acquiring Nynex Corp. topped the list. None of the
companies would comment.

In Brief: THE BALL DROPS WITHOUT NEW NOTES


IBM's Lotus Development Corp. would not confirm late last week
whether it met its year-end deadline to ship its new version
of Notes. But even if the vendor had Notes 4.0 out the door
before the ball dropped at New York's Times Square, analysts
said the company effectively missed the deadline because users
were unable to install the final commercial Notes 4.0 release
in 1995. Most users doubted Lotus would meet its promised deadline,
according to Dale Johnson, president of Johnson Consulting
Inc., a Woburn, Mass., consultancy.

In Brief: CISCO KILLS BUG


Cisco Systems Inc., San Jose, Calif., last week said that a
software bug temporarily shut down some of its Grand Junction
workgroup switches, knocking out about 300 LANs worldwide.
A glitch in the internal clocks of some FastSwitch 2100 and
2800 switches caused them to shut down at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday,
Dec. 27, and then restart at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday, Dec. 31.
The problem was not a virus but a system software error, Cisco
said last week. Engineers corrected the problem and do not
expect a recurrence.

MICROSOFT STRIKES BACK -- Besieged by Netscape, BackOffice delivers
a powerful and reliable NT-based Web server

By:
WAYNE RASH JR.

Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Information Server is clearly aimed
at the high end. Available only as a free beta download, there's
a good chance that you've already seen this product, since
it's the platform that's been running Microsoft's site on the
World Wide Web since last summer. As a result, Microsoft has
gained a great deal of experience at designing and implementing
a Windows NT-based Web server designed for heavy volumes and
high performance. The company has used this experience in creating
the commercial version of its Internet server.

In addition, when Microsoft ships the final version (available
either as a free download or for $99 in shrink-wrap), it will
bundle the ability to work with its SQL Server database. This
means that users who want to progress beyond "brochureware"
have an easy way to provide information to the Net. In fact,
the SQL Server database does not need to be located on the
Internet server, but instead can be located elsewhere on the
company network, which can ease the administration load and
reduce the requirement to duplicate data. Of course, if you
have a machine with enough capacity, you can locate SQL Server
on the Windows NT server that's running the Internet Information
Server.

The Microsoft Internet Information Server must run on a Windows
NT Server, version 3.51. In addition, it requires that Service
Pack 2 be applied before you attempt to install the server
software. Server Pack 2 was included on the CD-ROM that also
included the Internet Server, but it still requires an extra
step. Specifically, you must first apply the update software
(which is essentially an automatic process), reboot the computer
and load the Internet Server.

Installing the Internet Information Server is a nearly hands
off process. Once you make some basic choices, the installer
takes over and handles the rest. Adding to the ease of use
is a set of well-designed management and access tools. For
example, the server management package can run either on the
Windows NT machine itself or on a workstation elsewhere on
the network. In addition, the package can manage several Internet
Information Servers at a time, which can reduce workload and
make large sites much more practical to administer.

As you'd expect from a server aimed at high-end users, Microsoft's
Internet Information Server ships with effective management
tools. Able to run either on the server platform itself or
on a remote workstation, these tools manage server function
on any attached Internet Information Server. Although the nature
of Internet servers is such that the vast majority of such
management involves monitoring status, you can use Microsoft's
now-familiar tabbed notebook metaphor to change a variety of
operational and security settings.

In addition to its own management service, Microsoft includes
a Simple Network Management Protocol agent so you can keep
tabs on the Internet server as a part of a larger management
solution.

What Microsoft doesn't include, at least in this beta version,
is a World Wide Web authoring tool. Although such a tool is
available from Microsoft for use with Microsoft Word, it wasn'tshipped
in the Internet Information Server box. On the other hand,
Microsoft includes its Internet Explorer Web browser for Windows
3.1, Windows 95 and Windows NT. Unlike the vendors of some
World Wide Web-browser software, the versions included by Microsoft
can be distributed by network managers without additional fees.
Microsoft says that its server also will work with browsers
from other manufacturers, which we confirmed via Net-scape
Communications Corp.'s Netscape Navigator.

Another factor that makes the Microsoft Internet Information
Server easier to absorb into an organization is that it runs
on any hardware platform that supports Windows NT. This means
you can start running it on an Intel computer, but can move
to a PowerPC, MIPS or Alpha machine as your needs change.

Microsoft puts a lot of stock in its feature set, and with some
justification. Although it's not clear that most users will
need all the features included with the Internet Information
Server, at least if you do need them, they're there. Some of
the most useful features include an FTP service and a Gopher
service. Although these services are readily available from
third parties, it's convenient to have them bundled instead
of needing to purchase new software.

Likewise, Microsoft takes advantage of Windows NT Server's excellent
security to provide a server that can handle both password
and data encryption. You can disable anonymous log-ins, for
example.

Whether you should wait for the Internet Information Server
to ship or choose to move ahead now with Netscape Netsite or
O'Reilly & Associates Inc.'s WebSite depends on your level
of experience and needs. Netscape, for example, has shown an
admirable dedication to making sure its products are secure,
even to the extent of offering rewards to people who can break
its security. O'Reilly has long promised easy setup of a site
on the World Wide Web. Microsoft appears to offer both capabilities.

The fact that Microsoft has developed its Internet Information
Server for its own use in an extremely busy environment is
encouraging. Of course, the same can be said for Netscape's
products, so though Microsoft ranks with the leaders here,
it's not unique.

We found the process of installing and using Microsoft's Internet
Information Server to be anticlimactic. Unlike a number of
beta products we've been reviewing, this one works. If it ships
with complete documentation and competent support, Microsoft's
Internet Information Server could be an excellent solution
for businesses and organizations both small and large, especially

CrossWind Multithreads

By:
RON COPELAND

CrossWind Technologies Inc. will announce next week a new version
of its real-time, enterprise-wide collaboration software, which
features a new multithreaded architecture to improve application
performance and extend application scalability to more than
50,000 users.

Synchronize 2.0 does this by taking advantage of the multi-threaded
capabilities of Microsoft Windows NT server and other Unix
environments. Multithreading, which optimizes the interaction
of the software with the underlying server hardware, is administrator
configurable. Client requests, inter-server communications
and disk I/O also can be optimized.

Synchronize is a platform- and electronic-mail-independent calendaring
and scheduling application that supports users and resources
across an enterprise network. The software lets users easily
schedule meetings and resources, distribute agendas and memos,
assign and track tasks and issue reminders, the company said.

The Synchronize software communicates directly across the TCP
IP network at network transport speeds to provide real-time
scheduling, task and resource management, said David Wellington,
president and CEO of CrossWind, Santa Cruz, Calif.

Synchronize 2.0 adds an Apple Macintosh client to the currently
available Window 3.x, Windows NT, X11/Motif and ASCII environments.
LAN-based and remote access are supported.

Synchronize 2.0 will be available in mid-February and will sell
for $100 per client.

CrossWind Technologies can be reached at http://www.crosswind.com
or 408-469-1780.

Sybase Previews App Upgrade

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

Sybase Inc.'s PowerSoft Corp. subsidiary has begun showing selected
corporate users a beta version of its next-generation PowerBuilder
5.0.

PowerSoft's new offering maintains the drag-and-drop simplicity
of previous versions and a 16-bit capability for Microsoft
Windows 3.1, but adds the 32-bit capabilities of Windows 95,
Windows NT, Unix and Apple Macintosh environments. Only PowerBuilder
for Windows 95 and Windows NT beta copies were shown to users.

Observers said they expect to see released copies of the Windows
versions in March, with Macintosh and Unix versions appearing
later this year.

"We're going to use it to solve maintenance and management problems
across thousands of clients," said Tom Cervenka, senior research
programmer for the University of Illinois university system,
in Urbana.

The new version of PowerBuilder performs practical application
partitioning across the network and offers an object management
facility, new data windows, the look and feel of Windows 95
and support for extended Object Linking and Embedding 2.0 automation.

In a future release PowerBuilder will offer "a World Wide Web
object inside it that would allow the creation of Web-enabled
applications and the recognition" of OLE Controls-based HyperText
Markup Language components," said Robert Zurek, director of
research and development for Sybase's PowerSoft division.

Depending upon the application, compiled code can run from two
to 10 times faster than the interpretive code of previous versions.

Pricing for PowerBuilder 5.0 has not been set.

EDA/SQL Gets Messaging Middleware

By:
MARTIN MARSHALL

The next generation of Information Builders Inc.'s EDA/SQL will
offer corporate users both synchronous and asynchronous replication
options and the benefits of messaging middleware.

The New York middleware vendor announced last month it has licensed
message-oriented middleware technology from Mo- mentum Software
Corp. and will incorporate it into EDA/ SQL 4.0, which is expected
in March.

The incorporation of Momentum's X*IPC messaging middleware will
enable IBI's replication and gateway facilities to connect
remote servers in an asynchronous fashion.

"One of the advantages of the asynchronous aspect that Momentum
brings is performance. Users can fire off four queries or so
without having to wait for the first query results to come
back," said Alan Tonnesen, executive vice president of Insync
Software Corp., Ronkonkoma, N.Y.

EDA/SQL 4.0 can replicate data bidirectionally to roaming, heterogeneous
environments.

Pricing for the new version of EDA has yet to be determined.

IBI can be reached at http://www.ibi.com or 212-736-4433.

Banyan's New TCP/IP Backs Win 95

By:
Sharon Fisher

Banyan Systems Inc. has introduced a version of its TCP/IP applications
suite that supports Microsoft Windows 95 and includes a Web
browser.

Banyan TCP/IP Applications Suite 2.0 is an enhancement of software
licensed from Ipswitch Inc., Lexington, Mass. Originally, users
of Banyan's Vines network operating system obtained TCP/IP
access from FTP Software Inc., but Banyan, Westborough, Mass.,
switched to Ipswitch last year (CommWeek, Jan. 23, 1995)

"I like it so far," said John Herzog, network and information
center coordinator for Silicorp Ltd., Toronto. The company
is in the process of migrating directly from the FTP software
to the Ipswitch software, and is running it on 20 workstations,
planning to expand that to 300 this month, he said. "We're
about to try it out on the Internet. Corporately, it's solving
all of our needs."

The software has been rewritten to offer a 32-bit kernel, TCP
IP stack and applications, said Jeff Bernard, director of enterprise
marketing. This means that the software now works with Windows
95, he said. But the software is backwards-compatible with
16-bit applications, both from the previous version of the
Ipswitch product and with the FTP product, Bernard said.

In addition, the TCP/IP applications can run on the TCP/IP stack
built into Windows 95, Bernard said. In the next three months,
the company will release an Internet Protocol client that will
let network administrators integrate the Vines desktop with
TCP/IP services so only TCP/IP leaves the desktop, he said.
Ordinarily, Vines communications use Vines/IP, which is based
on TCP/IP, but is not compatible with it.

Other new features include IMosaic, a World Wide Web browser,
he said. "It is integrated, which makes it very easy for people
to get a well-supported product from us that leverages the
Internet."

The software now includes support for the Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol, which lets organizations share TCP/IP addresses through
dynamic configuration.

In addition, the software's VT320 emulation has been enhanced
to support The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.'s American National
Standards Institute terminal emulation, Bernard said. The software
is compatible with the industry-standard Winsock 1.1 application
programming interfaces, giving developers a standard way to
communicate with TCP/IP protocol stacks from Windows applications.
Winsock 2.0 will be supported when that specification is final,
Bernard said.

The software also is easier for network administrators to install
on multiple PCs, he said. Previously, the applications needed
to be installed individually on each PC from a floppy disk.
With the new version, the software can be installed from a
CD on the server to all the PCs simultaneously.

The software is available now. Prices start at $4,995 for a
50-user pack.

Banyan can be reached at http://www. banyan.com or 508-898-1000.

New UnixWare on Tap

By:
Evan Schuman

As officials of Unix's new owners-The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.
prepare for their first merged version of the operating system,
two new versions of UnixWare, formerly owned by Novell Inc.,
and SCO's OpenServer are in the wings and will start shipping
in volume in a matter of weeks.

The main attribute of the new version of UnixWare, code-named
"Eiger," which Novell had been calling UnixWare 2.1, is that
it will start integrating NetWare features, such as native
NetWare 4.1 file, print and directory services. This is meant
to let NetWare clients access files and printers via a UnixWare
server as if that server were running NetWare.

Gianfranco Enrico, the chief architect and architecture director
for Ing. C. Olivetti and Co. SpA, a Unix OEM, said he considered
the inclusion of the NetWare features to be essential. "We
expect it really will become standard for any Unix offering
to have NetWare services," he said.

Bob Sprowls, Unix OEM Unisys Corp.'s director of server marketing,
said his company's priorities were different from Novell's,
and the resultant release shows it. Novell's "goal was not
Unix, but was bringing in the NetWare stuff," he said. "Our
interest was more in enhancing the overall Unix environment."

Speedier Version

Other than NetWare features, the new version of UnixWare will
be slightly faster. Michael DeFazio, Novell's senior vice president
of development for the company's operating systems division,
estimated that the new version would be about 5 percent to
10 percent faster. Scott McGregor, SCO's senior vice president
for products, agreed with DeFazio's estimate for likely end
user impact but said the enhancements will be more dramatic
for OEMs performing benchmarking.

The next version of the operating system also supports some
of the newer disk drives and graphics cards and has a new C++
compiler.

A traditional sore spot with Unix licensees historically has
been pricing and licensing terms. Although OEMs generally say
Novell has done a far better job with licensing than its predecessor,
AT&T, SCO has nonetheless established a different pricing structure
with next month's release of Eiger.

The pricing change is "to make it more in line with OpenServer
pricing," said SCO's Jeff Ait, a vice president in charge of
the transition. Asked why Santa Cruz, Calif.-based SCO didn't
wait for the merged release to change pricing details, he said
the changes made market sense, regardless of the operating
system's sale.

SCO will be charging extra for various licensed capabilities,
which have not been offered before.

One OEM who was briefed said the changes involve moving away
from some of the unlimited number of user licenses Novell offers
to pricing determined by the number of users. "There are situations
where buying UnixWare will now be cheaper and situations where
it will now be more expensive," the OEM said.

With OpenServer's new version-code-named "Comet" and likely
to ship about 30 to 60 days after Eiger ships-the most significant
improvement is an increase in the maximum amount of RAM supported,
to 4 gigabytes from 512 megabytes.

"A lot of people who use large databases are concerned about
the amount of memory," McGregor said. "If you're a customer,
you just really want to know that you're not going to run out
of gas," he added.

IBM Support Uncertain for Warp Connect

By:
MARCIA A. JACOBS

IBM's commitment to the PowerPC version of its Warp Connect
operating system software is waning. The company missed its
year-end "shipment" date and announced a complex ordering plan.

The product's lateness and the uncertainty about exactly which
features of Warp Connect made it into the PowerPC version have
users and analysts questioning the need for it.

"I don't think the market cares anymore,'' said Tom Kurcharvy,
an analyst at Summit Strategies Inc., Boston. "IBM did more
to destroy momentum for the PowerPC than any company ever did.''

George Szatckowski, senior technical support specialist at the
Chicago railroad company Metra, agreed. "At the moment, we
have no PowerPCs. There are no specific plans for it.'' The
company uses Unix for its high-end graphics programs and doesn't
see any reason to switch.

Would-be Warp Connect PPC users must order custom machines for
desktops or servers from IBM.

At least one user cited scalability as a need for Warp Connect
PPC. "I'm definitely interested from the perspective of having
a more scalable architecture,'' said Arlene Allen, assistant
director of information systems at the University of California
at Santa Barbara.

IBM said Microsoft Windows applications that run on Warp will
run on Warp Connect PPC, but Warp applications must be recompiled
first. Kurcharvy said that if Warp Connect PPC only runs Windows
applications, the need for buying Warp Connect PPC does not
exist because Microsoft Windows NT already runs on the PowerPC
(CommWeek, May 15)

Warp Connect for the PowerPC will be priced the same as Warp
Connect, which retails for $299 with Windows included, and
$229 without the upgrade.

IBM can be reached at http://www.ibm.com or 800-426-4968.

Microsoft Hones In on IP

By:
AMY ROGERS

In hindsight, 1995 may be regarded as the year that TCP/IP hit
the big time.

This is due in no small part to Microsoft Corp.'s bundling of
a TCP/IP protocol stack into its Windows 95, thus making the
protocols upon which the Internet operates widely available.

Last year, many users opted to run Microsoft's less-sophisticated
Internet Protocol stack to save themselves the hassle of substituting
another vendor's stack. The Windows 95 "stack is not elegant,
but it works," said Doug McDonald, a technical services manager
in the MIS department at Rogue Valley Medical Center, Medford,
Ore.

But, he added, "it doesn't have all the applications that NetManage
or Frontier or WRQ has."

Last year, traditional stack vendors, such as NetManage Inc.
and WRQ, started focusing on creating value-added applications
that run equally well on their own stacks and over Microsoft's.

For example, NetManage, Cupertino, Calif., said it would provide
software to let users access extra bandwidth for running applications.

Frontier Technologies Corp., Mequon, Wis., bundled a suite of
TCP/IP applications with its CyberJunction gateway, which converts
Novell Inc.'s Internetwork Packet Exchange protocol into TCP
IP for running network utilities and for Internet access.

TGV Software Inc., Santa Cruz, Calif., upgraded its MultiNet
for Windows by adding a feature that lets users choose among
various TCP/IP applications.

In many cases, Internet access is not the primary reason network
managers are rushing to implement stacks and applications.
In 1995, managers wanted stacks for file-sharing applications,
to send and receive electronic mail and to access host data
via terminal emulation.

As these managers turned elsewhere for TCP/IP applications,
theyhad to integrate a mix of vendors' applications, while
other users have begun to sample Microsoft's own IP utilities.

Jeff Matchan, a systems support specialist for the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Association, said he replaced Microsoft's Internet
Explorer with Netscape Communications Corp.'s Net-scape Commerce
Server for economic reasons. "We get [Commerce Server] free
because we are a non-profit organization," he said. "With Internet
Explorer, I'd have to buy a license for each workstation."

Matchan said he could not access a Hewlett-Packard Co. Unix
based server with LAN WorkPlace for DOS, a TCP/IP package from
Novell Inc., with Windows 95 running. Instead, he used the
Telnet application included in the Microsoft stack

Translation Feature on Its Way -- Hypercom to bundle legacy
TCP gateway into routers and FRADs

By:
AMY ROGERS

Hypercom Network Systems Inc. is bundling a protocol-translation
feature into its routers and frame-relay access devices this
month to help network managers trying to incorporate legacy
data into a TCP/IP LAN.

The feature, which is called Legacy/TCP gateway, will be bundled
into Hypercom's Integrated Enterprise Networking routers and
FRADs. The gateway interprets legacy protocols such as bisynchronous
or Systems Network Architecture in a TCP/IP format to give
users access to the Internet and other TCP/IP services.

Legacy interfaces correspond to their own TCP/IP sessions, eliminating
the need to encapsulate data in a non-native format, according
to officials at the Phoenix-based company. Thus, all legacy
based data arrives at the server as TCP/IP traffic.

"Each side sees data in its native form," said Dave Matusow,
lead SNA architect at Hypercom. "Routers take SNA data and
throw it into an IP frame and route it like any other traffic."

He said the problem with that approach is network managers may
experience TCP/IP session failures.

Legacy/TCP Gateway takes care of distributing sessions through
the enterprise to ensure that no node becomes overloaded. Consequently,
network management traffic is reduced, he said.

Legacy/TCP Gateway is already bundled into many Hypercom products.

Hypercom can be reached at 602-866-5399.

SMC Unveils Hub, Switch

By:
ERIC LACH

Standard Microsystems Corp. has announced a hub aimed at small
work groups and an Ethernet switch.

The six-port switch, called the EZswitch-6x, is designed as
a low-cost plug-and-play version of the company's TigerSwitch.
The switch provides simultaneous wire-speed Ethernet connections
on all ports, delivering 60 megabits per second of throughput
in half-duplex mode or 120 Mbps in full-duplex mode, said Jim
Colantropo, senior product marketing manager at SMC, Hauppauge,
N.Y.

The switch uses a crossbar switching matrix, which allows simultaneous
support of multiple packets across the switch. As many as six
switching paths can be established at a time, with each path
crossing two ports.

Of the six ports, five are RJ-45 10Base-T ports; one is a combination
AUI/TP/BNC 10-Mbps port.

SMC's new shared Ethernet hub, the EtherEZ Hub, comes in five
, eight- and 16-port configurations and costs about $25 per
port, said Mike Pellicone, SMC product marketing manager.

The EZswitch-6x sells for $1,199 and ships immediately. The
EtherEZ Hub, also available now, comes with five RJ-45 ports
for $125; or eight RJ-45 ports and one BNC port for $239; or
16 RJ-45 ports, one BNC and one AUI port for $499.

SMC can be reached at http://www.smc.com/ or 800-762-4968.

FCC OKs Sprint's European Plans

By:
JOHN RENDLEMAN

The FCC last month approved Sprint's alliance with France Telecom
and Deutsche Telekom AG, clearing the way for Sprint and its
European partners to begin offering business customers integrated
international voice- and data-communications services.

The FCC's approval of the venture eliminated the final U.S.
regulatory barrier to Sprint's plan to sell each of its European
partners a 10 percent equity stake in Sprint for a combined
total of between $3.5 billion to $4.2 billion and establish
a separate international-services joint venture.

Once established, the venture will benefit users by giving them
a single source for seamless voice and data connections between
the United States and international locations, although hurdles
remain before the three partners will be able to make their
plans a reality, users and analysts said.

Global Connectivity

"Anywhere you could get global connectivity from your local
provider would be a good thing," said Scott Cervenka, manager
of network services at Hartmarx Corp., a Chicago apparel maker.
Sprint may have some initial difficulties working with its
new partners, but "I'm sure that it's nothing that couldn't
be worked out eventually," Cervenka said.

"Sprint is doing this to bring its service portfolio up to par
with what MCI and AT&T already offer through their global partnerships,"
said Christine Heckart, director of broadband consulting at
TeleChoice Inc., a consultancy in Verona, N.J.

The Sprint venture resembles MCI Communications Corp.'s Concert
alliance with BT and AT&T's WorldPartners cooperative agreement
with a number of European and Asian carriers. It is intended
to give customers one contact for international voice and data
circuits, Heckart said.

"There is a definite market need among multinational companies
that want a single source provider of their communications
needs" to eliminate the cost of procuring and maintaining dissimilar
communications services from different providers around the
world, Heckart said.

The venture's first service offerings, expected to become available
to consumers early this year, will be integrated versions of
services already offered separately by each of the three partners,
said Stuart Mathison, assistant vice president of strategic
planning at Sprint International, Reston, Va.

The three companies have begun the integration process. They
said they plan to launch the services and announce features
and prices, as well as a name and logo for the venture, following
a Jan. 12 Sprint shareholder vote on the European partners'
equity investment in Sprint, Mathison said.

Alliance to Extend Data Services to Users

By:
MARK ROCKWELL

AT&T subsidiary AT&T Network Systems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard
Co. said they will develop software and hardware in a broad
marketing alliance that will help telephone and cable-television
providers extend broadband data services to users.

The alliance is expected to boost the capabilities of each company
to provide broadband data services and equipment to cable and
telephone companies. Products resulting from the alliance will
primarily target the consumer market, though there will be
some business applications.

According to AT&T Network Systems, the alliance is expected
to provide products for Internet access, home shopping, telecommuting,
interactive games, personal audio channel, distance learning,
interactive advertising and telemedicine in wired and wireless
environments.

The companies said they hope to develop a common network software
platform for interactive data networks, applications for that
platform, interactive television technology, network elements,
computing systems, test instruments, cable TV modems, network
management and software technologies.

Hardware, such as cable modems and high-speed network elements,
will be rolled out in the next six months, said Carly Fiorina,
president of AT&T Network Systems. In the next year, AT&T Network
Systems and HP plan to deliver head-end equipment for cable
and telephone companies that allows the two companies to manage
broadband services to business and residential customers.

"This is a very good sign. AT&T and Hewlett-Packard are legitimizing
the effort to bring broadband services to the home,'' said
Amy Reiber, a broadband consultant at TeleChoice Inc., a Verona,
N.J., consultancy.

Deal Targets Desktop Services

By:
MARK ROCKWELL

Aiming to offer more desktop communications services to a burgeoning
outsourcing market, Ameritech and IBM have teamed up to sell
each other's services to their existing customers.

Together, the companies are vying for a piece of the estimated
$33 billion global outsourcing market, especially in the areas
of integrated voice and video services and support.

"There's a lack of voice and video integration,'' said Sam Pomazano,
a vice president at IBM's subsidiary Integrated Systems Solutions
Corp. (ISSC)

"Customers need convergence help,'' said Jack Wright, president
of custom business services at Ameritech.

The two companies formed an alliance recently to market integrated
voice, video and data services, providing customers with a
single point of contact for desktop-based communications. The
seven-year agreement will first extend the outsourcing capabilities
to existing ISSC and Ameritech customers.

A selection of equipment and services will be available to telecommunications
managers through the alliance, such as PCs, software and videoconferencing
equipment and service.

IBM's ISSC subsidiary will work with Ameritech to manage Ameritech's
desktop computing and LAN requirements. Ameritech will provide
ISSC with voice and video desktop-support services for sites
throughout the country, Ameritech and ISSC officials said.

Internet Scanner Ported to Win NT

By:
Karen Rodriguez

Internet Security Systems Inc. has announced plans to ship a
version of its Internet Scanner software for systems running
Microsoft Windows NT, providing users with a tool to detect
weak security links in their Internet-connected networks.

Employing the same techniques used by hackers to penetrate large
corporate networks, ISS' Internet Scanner will detect up to
130 network vulnerabilities, including those found on PCs running
Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 95.

ISS said it plans to provide in mid-1996 a version of its software
that runs on Windows NT servers. Scanner runs on major Unix
platforms and the Linux operating system, and is priced according
to the number of devices in the network. It ranges from $800
for a small network to $80,000 for 10,000 devices.

The currently shipping version 3.2 of Internet Scanner gives
network administrators more control over all local and remote
PCs. Such nodes are often the sites in a network from which
hackers gain access to corporate network resources, said Chris
Klaus, founder and CEO of ISS, Norcross, Ga.

"Our focus on Microsoft holes stems from our understanding that
the weakest link on a network is often the common PC," Klaus
said.

Scanner Specifics

Scanner is a diagnostic tool that simulates Internet hacker
attacks, similar to the highly publicized Security Administrator
Tool for Analyzing Networks software that is available free
on the Net. But, as a commercial product, Scanner is supported
and regularly updated with detections for newfound vulnerabilities.

Scanner directly tests for Internet Protocol spoofing; firewall
checks, such as source porting; and other risks to Web servers.
It also tests for mail security holes and vulnerabilities in
X-Windows, as well as access to Network File System and brute
force break-in attempts.

The tool automatically tests a network and generates a report
that can be viewed by a Web browser with links to patches and
references to Computer Emergency Response Team advisories and
other software solutions.

"We use Scanner as a diagnostic tool," said George Kurtz, data
security consultant at Price Waterhouse's Management Consulting
Group in Morristown, N.J. "It's been a real big help. It's
comprehensive and Chris Klaus is always looking for the latest
vulnerabilities and immediately building them into the product.
There is no lag time between discovery and update."

Scanner can be used in tandem with firewalls and other packet
filtering devices to ensure they are configured correctly and
remain current with the latest security measures.

"As a sanity check, administrators should be running these tools
against their firewalls for an overall security check. If there
are any holes, you can bet a hacker will find out," Kurtz said.

He added that in their zeal to connect to the Net, many companies
neglect to define a security policy or firewall implementation,
which can lead to break-ins despite efforts to put the best
security measures in place.

ISS can be reached at http:// iss.net or 404-441-2531.

Hummingbird Enhances Columbus Software

By:
KAREN RODRIGUEZ

Hummingbird Communications Ltd. will broaden its intranet strategy
by integrating advanced portable document technologies into
its Columbus suite of Internet/intranet software.

By adding Common Ground Software Inc.'s suite of document authoring,
management and collaborative documentation-development technologies,
acquired in late December with its $6 million purchase of Common
Ground, Hummingbird will be better positioned to help its users
build their internal distributed networks using the Internet.

"Common Ground's electronic-document technology offers more
than just document authoring and archiving tools-it provides
organizations with a highly functional platform for information
management and workplace collaboration," said Fred Sorkin,
chairman, president and CEO of Hummingbird, Toronto.

Hummingbird had licensed Common Ground's technology for inclusion
in Columbus, Hummingbird's intranet/Internet desktop suite
for PCs. Common Ground 2.0, which will be integrated into Columbus
and ship Jan. 15, includes a platform-independent, electronic
portable document technology that competes with Adobe Systems
Inc.'s Acrobat. It also contains a collaborative document-authoring
environment, intranet/World Wide Web publishing and archival
tools, and utilities that enable legacy documentation to be
converted easily to a portable electronic-document format for
enterprise-wide distribution.

Columbus is expected to cost between $150 and $300 per desktop.
Initial versions will run on Microsoft Windows 3.11 clients;
versions for Win 95 and Win NT will follow later in the year.

A personal Web server has been built into Columbus to let users
in the intranet create their own home pages, as well as an
intelligent agent that automatically collects information within
the company.

Additional technologies available include Common Ground's Web
publishing system that includes a batch-file-format converter
for moving legacy documents onto the Web.

Common Ground, Belmont,Calif., pioneered the electronic-document
technology market with the release of Common Ground 1.0 in
1993.

Hummingbird can be reached at 416-496-2200.

Ganymede Lets Its Chariot Ride

By:
RUTRELL YASIN

Network managers looking for a way to determine how their client
server applications will have an impact on network performance
should find what they are seeking with a product from Ganymede
Software Inc.

The start-up has launched Chariot, a software tool that lets
network operators simulate application data traffic on their
networks, letting them gauge the effect an application will
have on the network before deploying it.

The emergence of such technologies as frame-relay and asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) have prompted network managers to search
for tools that can handle a variety of performance- analysis
duties, the Research Triangle Park, N.C., company said. Network
managers and vendors are using a combination of products-modeling
tools, Remote Monitoring software and frame generators-to test
performance, said Steve Joyce, vice president of marketing
at Ganymede.

Beta testers said Chariot will complement their traditional
testing and analyzer tools because it gives them a way to measure
the end-to-end performance of complex networks.

Performance Evaluation

North Carolina's Microelectronics, Communications and Networking
Center, an interoperability testing lab in Research Triangle
Park, is using Chariot to evaluate the performance of its ATM
network. With its ATM infrastructure, MCNC is providing a way
for customers and vendors to evaluate high-speed networking
technology and applications.

"We're trying to see what happens to applications running in
an ATM" network that typically has voice, video and data running
across it, said Nancy Agosta, director of MCNC's Center for
Network Testing Services.

Chariot consists of an IBM OS/2-based console and end points
that reside on OS/2 or Microsoft Windows 95-based client workstations.

Chariot will be available at the end of the month. Pricing starts
at $11,000.

Ganymede can be reached at 919-558-1138.

Clientele Boosts Wares -- Help-desk features enhance suite of
automation tools

By:
BETH DAVIS

Clientele Software Inc. expanded its suite of automation tools
by adding help-desk capabilities.

The company, formerly known as AnswerSet Corp., has added Clientele
IS, a software package that builds on its flagship product,
Clientele, combining asset management and problem resolution
with Clientele's call-tracking and management capabilities,
the Tualatin, Ore., company said.

Kevin Roberts, MIS director at Clark, Klein and Beaumont plc,
a Detroit law firm, said he originally bought Clientele a year
ago "because of its flexibility and ability to be molded into
your environment.''

Because Clientele was designed to support external customers,
Roberts tweaked it to fit his internal IS department. In the
past month, however, Roberts said he has been impressed with
the new software. "I think they did a better job than I did,''
he said.

Dale Wetzelberger, operations manager for Baltimore-based Aerotech
Inc., said he chose Clientele/IS to support the approximately
1,500 employees working for the personnel and temporary placement
firm because it's easy to customize.

The software maintains a list of preferred products, services
and vendors. It also processes and tracks new equipment orders
and converts received orders to registered inventory. Assets
can be identified by pre-defined categories, such as serial
number, asset number or user.

Call-tracking features enable incoming calls to be assigned
to specific support representatives or user-defined groups,
which can represent physical location or other attributes.

Running under Microsoft Windows on a PC platform, the software
costs $3,495 and includes three concurrent user licenses, training
and one year of support and maintenance. It is available now.

Clientele Software can be reached at 503-598-4500.

Management Insight: RESOLUTIONS? BAH, HUMBUG! HERE'S AN ENTERPRISE MGM'T 
WISH LIST INSTEAD

By:
Rick Sturm

Now that the holiday season is behind us, most of us are looking
forward to the new year. It's the time to set goals and make
resolutions. I won't make my New Year's resolution here, but
I do submit a wish list for things I would like to see happen
in the world of management in 1996.

First, as many people are thinking about peace, I add a much
more modest wish. The acrimony and divisiveness that emerged
last year around the SNMPv2 issue has been appalling and incredibly
destructive. Not only have friendships been ruined, but many
other Simple Network Management Protocol-related efforts have
been stalled pending resolution of this issue, and the effectiveness
of the entire Internet Engineering Task Force standards process
has been called into question. So, the first item on my wish
list is for peace within the SNMP community.

The second item is very closely related to the first. I would
like to have a secure, effective way to control and configure
devices remotely on a network. I don't care if you call this
solution SNMPv2. All I care about is getting this ability as
soon as possible.

Next, I'd like to see the major vendors of management software
declare a moratorium on the acquisition of independent companies.
The current trend in the industry is for larger companies to
wait for someone to develop a new product and then buy it.
This approach carries far less risk than attempting to develop
something new. On the other hand, it seems a little like cheating
on an exam in school.

I would also like to see the platform vendors agree on a common
set of application progamming interfaces for their products.
This would allow third-party developers to develop and introduce
products more quickly and at a lower cost.

My fifth wish is that all of the major platform vendors participate
in the Enterprise Management Shoot-Out at the Enterprise Management
Summit. This is the one concrete way in which they can allow
users to compare their products in an objective environment.

Finally, I want people to understand better the issues of network
and systems management. First, I'd like to have the end users
understand it, so they can be more realistic in the demands
they place on operations. Second, I'd like for middle and upper
management to raise their levels of awareness so they can make
higher-quality decisions about funding network and systems
management.

I do not limit this just to users. I would like to see people
on the vendor side have a better grasp of these issues, too.

Each area is important and each of us can have an impact on
them. I plan to do all that I can in those areas and hope that
you will as well.

Rick Sturm is a principal at San Francisco's Enterprise Management
Institute Inc., dedicated to advancing enterprise management
through education and research. He also has been extensively
involved in network and systems planning at one of the Bell
operating companies. The opinions expressed are his own. He

Editorial: MIDDLEWARE TO BOOST APP SMARTS IN '96


There's ample evidence to support the contention that 1996 may
be the year network applications finally get some needed smarts.

And middleware will be the magic pill that's going to boost
application intelligence. Middleware is the first incarnation
of component software-the application model the industry is
slowly moving toward.

Middleware solutions will provide the glue companies will need
to design and build applications that are integral to a new
dynamic computing model.

Over the course of last year we saw such vendors as Sun, IBM
and Microsoft lay out their middleware and object strategies.

Last fall, Sun began shipping its Network Enterprise Objects.
NEO relies on Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA),
the industry-standard way for objects to communicate across
the network. The NEO platform includes OpenStep, an object
oriented development environment to build clients that can
access CORBA services or CORBA objects running on the server;
and Java, which can provide a client front end for NEO/CORBA
business objects running on the server.

IBM is a member of the Object Management Group, which promises
to support CORBA with its system object model and future distributed
system object model products.

IBM has also detailed plans to integrate its own asynchronous
messaging product, MQSeries, with several of its products.

Microsoft's approach centers on Object Linking and Embedding
(OLE), which has had a desktop-centric view of the world. Network
OLE, however, which is Microsoft's version of the Open Software
Foundation's DCE RPC, is expected sometime in 1997. It will
provide distributed features to OLE.

There's also ample evidence that distributed applications will
change the way we do business. We're beginning to see a glimpse
of this in the way access to corporate networks has been affected
by the Internet.

With asynchronous, store-and-forward technologies and distributed
objects, the need for expensive, full-time server-to-server
connections has diminished and the move toward smarter applications
is a given. Increasingly, the presence of middleware on enterprise
networks is becoming the norm.

With its adoption, the structure of the network will undergo
a healthy change, one that will allow it to mirror the way
people work.

Inside Perspective: NETWORK MANAGERS FACE A CHALLENGING YEAR

By:
Chris Roeckl

Like me, many of you probably spent the past couple of weeks
cleaning up your office, preparing for the new year. After
all, the end of December seems to be the only time in the networking
business when things slow down.

You also may have spent some time contemplating what this year
will bring in terms of new products and services that will
help make designing, implementing and managing your enterprise
network and the network applications that ride on that network
easier.

Certainly, many products will be delivered. We'll play our role
in helping you find them, as well as track the trends that
affect your business.

For example, the lines separating many technologies continue
to blur. There's been talk about the convergence of networking
and computing technology for years, where industry nirvana
amounts to the networked multimedia desktop. In the past couple
of years, major progress has been made to bring these technologies
together.

Such developments necessitate that companies take a team approach
when buying technologies. No longer can a network manager be
isolated from client/server applications developers or vice
versa.

Further, technologies within the enterprise network infrastructure
itself continue to become muddled. Thus, the decision about
whom to partner with for an array of networking equipment becomes
more difficult.

Layer on top of this trend the Internet and things really start
to get confusing. The Internet is changing the way companies
think about how they conduct their businesses. And beyond the
frenzy of preparing for electronic commerce, smart companies
are realizing that the structure of the Internet is suitable
to their business models; hence, the rise of the corporate
"intranet."

The Internet also stands to turn the telecommunications market
upside down, as companies begin to view the Internet as a viable
vehicle for handling network traffic that had been the sole
domain of traditional telephone companies using private leased
lines.

This comes at a time when the telecom industry is going through
significant change. While Congress tries to break up the remaining
monopoly of the local loop, the phone companies and local regulators
are working at the state level to bring competition into the
local services market.

These are just a few of the major areas that are reshaping the
world we work in today. So, if you were expecting your job
to get a little easier in 1996, it won't. Indeed, it will probably
be more difficult than ever.

What's different from years past, though, is that corporate
management is now fully cognizant of the importance of the
enterprise network. This puts the corporate network manager
in the spotlight.

We're aware that critical decisions can make or break the career
of a corporate network manager. That's why we take our job

Letters to the Editor: ISDN EVERYWHERE



Your article "ISDN Links Get Coded" has shed a glimmer of hope
on our efforts to make ISDN as "easy" to use as possible [CommWeek,
Dec. 4]

We are an Internet-service provider in the process of testing
ISDN connectivity in hopes of being able to offer this service
within the first quarter of 1996.

We are going to be performing many tests on installation procedures,
equipment configuration, software configuration and the whole
process of ordering ISDN. It is our hope that the lessons learned
through this exercise will let us set up a template and guidelines
for our clients interested in Internet connectivity via ISDN.

This has not been an easy task. Fortunately, our phone company
(Nynex) has changed its ISDN division management and is now
actively supporting ISDN requests and installations in its
service area. It has been very forthcoming in helping us establish
a test platform for its service.

I am confident that with Nynex's help, we will be able to jump
the ISDN hurdle and get this service up and running.

Letters to the Editor: BEHIND THE TIMES



I read with interest your story about Infonet Software Solutions
Inc.'s Messenger 400 and its ability to support message archiving
["MTA Archives Mail Messages," CommWeek, Dec. 11]

In fact, Messenger 400 is far down the power curve in its support
of archiving. Innosoft International Inc.'s PMDF message-transfer
agent has included message archiving for several years and
several of my consulting clients, including CGnet Services
and the Executive Office of the President, have used this feature
with great success. The latter, in fact, is using message archiving
specifically to support the requirements of the National Archives
and Records Administration mandate-since they were the agency
that originally brought this issue to the public eye.

Letters to the Editor: GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT


I just read the excellent editorial in CommunicationsWeek [Perspective,
"The Internet Phone Is Poised to Conquer," CommWeek, Dec. 11].
I could not agree with you more.

I wish this piece would somehow get into the "old media" to
wake up the rest of the world. The Internet has given the common
person the "fire of the gods" and I hope it will indeed change
the world for the better.

have led the way and made the concept and market mature. I
see that Micom Communications Corp. has the closest thing to
something practical along these lines. The stuff you talk about
will happen.

Fortunately, Microsoft Network, America Online, CompuServe and

Letters to the Editor: MISSING THE MARK


You have missed the point [Rash's Judgment, "The World According
to Gates: Universal Access and the Benefits of the Internet,"
CommWeek, Dec. 4]. The reason there is no detail is that up
until now, Microsoft was pursuing a proprietary (again) solution
to Internet business, the Microsoft Network. Not until they
realized they missed the mark by a long shot did the tone change
at Big Blue, er, Redmond.

Gates has been hammered lately by those who fail to bow to his
Redmondship and their "steal-anything-at-all-cost" philosophy.
Faced with an Internet marketplace where innovation is king,
Microsoft has a lot of catching up to do.

Gates impresses people with his power and money, especially
media types. Just take a look at the millions of dollars of
free publicity he got for that sophomoric fiasco called the
Windows 95 launch. The media ate that up like candy. Too bad
most of them know nothing about what Microsoft technology really
does and doesn't do.

This mail is being sent from a Windows 95 workstation. In spite
of the horsepower I have (100-megahertz Pentium), it is dog
slow. The interface is clumsy, and in no way comparable to
my other computer, my Apple Macintosh Quadra. If I had to send
you an attached document from this mail station, the non-Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extension-compliant Microsoft Mail would automatically
"un-encode" the software, forcing you to run it through a binary
converter so you could read it. I have no options to turn that
nonsense off.

Thank heaven they don't force me to go through the Microsoft
Network to get to the Internet. I would quit.

Microsoft is good at selling to the masses. I would guess they
spend more as a percentage on marketing than on research and
development. It's too bad their products are second-rate, clear
across the board.

Bill Gates is definitely not the person to lead us boldly forward.
He misguessed the Internet and is back-filling. This industry
is driven by demand and competition, not by self-appointed
pundits.

THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE NETWORK MANAGER -- As networks become
strategic corporate assets, business savvy becomes key to most
managers' success

By:
MARGIE SEMILOF

Sure, the network is still what matters most. But traditional
network managers are learning that business acumen, not technical
know-how, now holds the key to their future success.

Almost overnight, the information industry's computer fixation
has shifted from the desktop to the network. Along with this
metamorphosis comes a number of major changes for those charged
with developing the corporate computing infrastructure.

"I come from the days when Mr. Fixit was all anyone needed,"
says Anthony Iorio, director of telecommunications at ITT Corp.,
New York. "Today, my technical expertise is not as important
as knowing how to negotiate or whom to call if I need some
outside help."

Iorio's new role reflects the business changes taking place
at his company. As ITT splits into three companies this month,
Iorio's job will be transformed as well. In the past, Iorio
was responsible for hands-on development for a corporate telecommunications
network that incorporated the ITT Hartford insurance company,
the ITT Industries defense contractor and the corporate headquarters
owner of the Sheraton Hotels and Caesar's World casinos.

Wheeling and Dealing

Increasingly, Iorio is more of a deal maker, managing and negotiating
corporate contracts for the parent company. He also evaluates
new technologies before they are introduced into the corporate
architecture, and he's not alone in his new responsibilities.

As in the past, Iorio and other network managers still must
deliver 100 percent uptime, but their bigger challenge is marrying
applications to business processes when the technology itself
is a fast-moving target.

In addition, managers must explain the vast amount of technology
innovation to senior managers, who read about networking in
just about every magazine and hear about it every time they
turn on the television.

It's not easy to make a business case for, say, Lotus Notes,
when executives read that these technologies could be obliterated
by something called the World Wide Web.

Despite the upheaval, network managers are making their mark
on business. In an October 1995 study conducted by Valley Forge
Information Services, a Langhorne, Pa., market research firm,
80 out of 100 corporate network managers said they have a direct
influence on the business strategy of an organization.

The same study puts about 18 percent of network managers in
the executive tier of management in their companies.

And with the cost of failure higher than ever, change management
means balancing interest in new products and services with
the need to make firm decisions about technology directions.

"We need to be shrewd about what we choose to go with and what
is a passing fancy," says Colin Crook, senior technology officer
at Citicorp, New York.

For nearly four years, Crook has developed a global banking
network that makes increasingly intelligent devices available
to the bank's customers.

Although a rigid organizational model might be more comforting
to handle internal technology changes, the continually shifting
computer-industry landscape makes this nearly impossible. "The
World Wide Web didn't exist for us five years ago, and now
it's the hottest thing since sliced bread," Crook says.

Even though the full story of the Internet has yet to be told,
this late-blooming technology is largely responsible for showing
corporations new ways of connecting to internal users and external
customers.

Companies, such as Xerox Corp., are building Web sites as inexpensive
and easy ways to connect the company's far-flung employees
to a single, common bulletin board.

Other factors-most notably, the advent of truly distributed
computing-also are contributing to the network's ascent. And
though the actual price of technology stays about the same,
what $2,000 can deliver on a desktop keeps increasing.

"We have become indifferent to forms of computing, but we need
a network to help us put an application anywhere in the world,"
says John Hammit, a former CIO at United Technologies Corp.
in Hartford, Conn., and president of J. Hammit Group Inc.,
a Hartford consulting company.

Managers say they must nurture different skill sets compared
to what was required at the beginning of the decade. Business
planning once proceeded without technology input in most companies
but no more. Today, though network infrastructure experts may
not have moved any farther up the company flow chart, they
are deeply involved in the business-planning process.

What makes today's managers tick? Compared to five years ago,
there's added emphasis on working with multinational networks,
says Beverly Lieberman, president of Halbrecht Lieberman Associates,
a Stamford, Conn., search firm that specializes in hiring senior
information technology executives.

"This isn't just about working with others, culturally speaking,"
Lieberman says. "It's about getting work done-working with
carriers and overseas vendors." The nature of the job is more
complex than in the past.

Network managers typically have a degree or two in engineering
or computer science, but fewer than 10 percent have a master's
degree in business administration. But this may change as senior
executives demand their network staff become more business
focused-the MBA holds higher value.

Top managers are paid aggressively, Lieberman says. In a Fortune
200-size company, a top person in charge of the corporate network
infrastructure can earn $200,000 to $275,000, with a salary
bonus and stock options. Small-to-medium-size businesses will
pay about $100,000 to $150,000.

Although the network manager's position in the company hierarchy
hasn't changed much, the job has certainly ratcheted up in
importance.

"The infrastructure person is viewed as more front and center,
not back office," Lieberman says.

Though business skills are more highly prized than ever, technology
innovations over the past few years have altered the course
of career paths as well. Consider, for example, network outsourcing,
one of the biggest concepts in the 1980s that flip-flopped
in the 1990s.

A network manager five years ago would have made a buying decision
based purely on its cost benefit, choosing not to outsource,
even though vendors might have positioned it as a money-saving
measure.

Now, even if outsourcing turns out to cost more, a network manager
is just as likely to go for it.

A study conducted six years ago by Cimi Corp., a Voorhees, N.J.,
consulting company, polled 267 CIOs and found that only four
had outsourced some aspects of their information technology.
An updated survey this year revealed 121 out of the 267 CIOs
are now outsourcing.

What fuels this trend? No company will tolerate a network crash.
It was a shock to many managers when, in the mid-1980s, large
companies such as Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. handed over all
of their telecommunications management to a carrier. Now outsourcing
is commonplace.

Outsourcing keeps staff sizes small, and though it may cost
more, the network manager can hold the outside party contractually
responsible for a certain degree of performance.

Bob Galovic, managing director of information resources at the
national headquarters of the Automobile Association of America,
Heathrow, Fla., was ahead of his time on this trend. He says
that for years, he preferred Centrex service to owning a PBX.
It was worth it to offload the daily grind of running an internal
phone system to someone else.

ITT's Iorio says he outsources most of his corporation's network
management functions. And John Hodge, CIO at NAC Reinsurance
Co., a Hartford insurer, says he outsources the management
of his legacy computing systems. Hodge also has taken steps
to compartmentalize network services, so, if necessary, he
can change a carrier or buy some specialized service, such
as fax or electronic mail, without a major restructuring. "This
job becomes a management of those services," Hodge says.

To Outsource or Not to Outsource

Of course, there is outsourcing, and then there is outsourcing.
Even where managers retain network control, outsourcing can
exist within a technology, like frame-relay, saving managers
the trouble of building a private multiplexed network.

In these cases, "you are essentially letting the carrier do
the multiplexing for you," says Thomas Nolle, president of
Cimi. "The corporate network is smaller, even though service
costs go up."

Network sustainability isn't the only thing dictating the buying
habits of network managers. Network spending also solves immediate
business requirements, Nolle says. In the past, spending on
the technical infrastructure tended to be more in anticipation
of future business needs.

If senior managers want to see a return on their investments,
technologies, such as asynchronous transfer mode, will be harder
to justify, unless the senior executive has a strong knowledge
of what ATM does. Network managers must provide that expertise.

And although network managers and CIOs in traditional information
system hierarchies balance technical innovation with business
need, in some industries there's a growing shift in political
power that can't be ignored.

Rebel Armies

Workgroup knowledge workers-historically leery of central technology
organizations, which they view as tyrannical and expensive
are seizing control of their own technologies.

"Populist technology is flourishing in an unprecedented manner,"
Nolle says. "One of the little-heralded effects in the shift
toward personal computing is that first-line managers have
purchase authority over computers without needing anyone to
sign off."

Today, many end-user organizations want to buy and roll their
own applications. A CIO or network manager is often not in
a good position to set technical policy if numerous departments
in a multinational company are running their own show.

"We see the CIO as holding the coalition together," Nolle says.
"It's very Eisenhower-esque."

Local efforts are less likely to happen in industries with high
levels of transaction processing, such as retail, transportation
and utilities, says David Passmore, president of Decisys Inc.,
a Sterling, Va., consulting company.

"These companies still control networking from the top down.
Bank tellers don't aspire to be LAN managers," Passmore says.

Telecom's Role

Another consequence of the past five years is that in many companies,
the uproar over voice- and data-integration issues appears
to have subsided. Telecommunications and data communications
managers in the post-divestiture world assumed they would merge
under one collective umbrella.

But, again, the populist effect of downsizing technology makes
consolidation irrelevant in some cases. Since the evaluation
of new technology is often determined by budget, local departments
can easily afford a powerful PC that can do a number of complex
computing and networking tasks.

Carriers can sell services, such as AT&T's Network Notes, for
example, that take on the administration of Lotus Notes, or
they can buy Sprint's InfoXchange, which lets network managers
link their E-mail to a WAN without using a premises switch.
These products are a boon to local business departments, which
can-at least in theory-solve networking problems on their own
terms.

Although some product ideas have been hits, there are misses
as well. Local management of networks in many cases was more
successful than managing a network from a single console. Five
years ago, networking vendors were hawking a concept called
the "manager of managers," which included products, such as
AT&T's Accumaster Integrator, as a means of overseeing devices
throughout the enterprise.

These technologies were based on the assumption of a hierarchical
support structure that would require central management. Today,
line departments are buying LAN hubs for local activity and
managed by the department.

Some analysts and CIOs lament the fact that a decentralized
organization has less purchasing power and lacks a cohesive
plan. But there's an optimistic side to this scenario. Local
branches may spur innovation that could benefit the entire
corporation.

According to AAA's Galovic, his office sets a technical course
for 113 national clubs. But it's possible that a regional club
may choose to build something on its own.

"Our organization does not discourage a local club from doing
something different, but they need to know we have a core direction,"
Galovic says.

"If they fail at what they do, that's the risk they took. If
they succeed, maybe we have to jump on their bandwagon."

With this outlook, the network manager is surely entering a
new era.

TECHNOLOGY: WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS?

By:
Margie Semilof

Ask 10 network managers their top technology picks for the next
three years and expect to get just as many answers.

There is some agreement, however. The Internet, asynchronous
transfer mode, multimedia, computer-telephony integration (CTI)
and mobile and wireless computing top most lists. Additionally,
truly distributed, object-based computing that goes beyond
the creation of a mere client/server architecture is on their
minds, as well.

And, they say, don't write off so-called "old" technology. Five
years ago the World Wide Web held little appeal and everyone
predicted the demise of the mainframe. Now, the mainframe still
endures and technologies like the Internet are taking off.

In no particular order, here is a sampling of technologies network
managers consider their priority over the next three years.

- The Internet-more specifically, the World Wide Web. Managers
of corporate infrastructure all agree that the Internet is
important, but are not yet sure how it can help them. In the
same breath, network managers say they want quantum improvements
to network security.

- High-speed networks. These are needed to support faster, low
cost multimedia on the desktop. The convergence of voice, data
and video will be assisted by the simultaneous introduction
of high-speed networks. Anthony Iorio, director of telecommunications
at ITT Corp., New York, says CTI and multimedia are key to
providing personalized services to guests at ITT's hotel and
casino operations.

"Today, if a guest calls in to a hotel 100 times we will have
no prior information about that person," Iorio says. "Using
one basic CTI application, if that guest calls in, a screen
can pop up and we will have all we need to know about that
person: what type of room they like, what type of services
they prefer."

- Object-based systems. Object technology lets corporations
speed the time it takes to build applications and therefore
respond quickly to market changes. Network managers will continue
to distribute computing-storing information where it can do
the most good-rather than consolidating information in one
host repository.

- Mobile communications. Mobile networks will serve thousands
of sales forces and telecommuting users, as well as those at
remote sites. The Automobile Association of America, Heathrow,
Fla., says it considers mobile and wireless technology to be
the basis for developing a vehicle locator and a primary means
of member-club communications.

HE'S IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT

By:
Margie Semilof

Not long ago pundits predicted the demise of telecommunications
managers. Word was that IS shops would absorb corporate telecommunications
and those who ran the voice networks would report to computer
network gurus.

Bob Galovic disproves the theory. The Automobile Association
of America's director of information resources crossed the
boundary from manager of voice services to corporate information
systems administrator, and now he's steering the course.

Galovic is a nine-year veteran of AAA, based in Heathrow, Fla.,
with previous telecommunications management experience at Procter
& Gamble Co., Cincinnati.

The reason for his success has to do with AAA's long-held view
that telecommunications is central to its internetworking strategy.
Before Galovic was hired, the nationwide AAA had not yet tied
together its 113 member clubs-an effort that began in the late
1980s when Galovic took an active role in building LANs using
10Base-T Ethernet.

Today Galovic oversees management of all PCs, software and data
center support, including legacy systems, voice systems and
data networking. The information systems staff now numbers
70

people.

"I don't claim to be a PC guru," says Galovic, who has a degree
in mathematics. "I just need to know enough to understand it.

"In the next few years, based on the changing needs of AAA,
our next round of activity will be looking at delivering core
business products and services to external customers," he says.

Technologies such as the Internet and new call-distribution
techniques will alter the way AAA communicates with its customers,
he says. The biggest challenge does not center on any one technology,
however. Rather, it's the management of change-knowing what
technologies to adopt and what roads to bypass.

"You need to keep creativity high but still adhere to some basic
principles," Galovic says. "We want to remain cost-effective
and present ourselves as a unified organization with consistent
high-quality products."

So far, it seems, he's driving AAA down the right road.

Industry Insight: Understanding the 'Net's Business Model

By:
Don Gooding

At Venture Market East, in the shadow of Harvard University,
dozens of entrepreneurs recently had an opportunity to tell
their stories to crowds of eager but skeptical financiers.
At each presentation the same question was raised by the suit
and-tie crowd: "What's your business model?"

Now, for any self-respecting MBA, this is practically question
No. 1.

The business model is the qualitative and quantitative answer
to a set of important, basic questions: Who are your customers?
How expensive and time-consuming is customer acquisition? How
much do they pay you? What are the profit margins?

In the brave new world of the Internet, however, the answers
are not easy.

Internet business models are different from models of most existing
businesses, different this quarter from last quarter-and probably
next quarter.

For example, between Microsoft and Netscape, the traditional
desktop-software model has been trashed. Microsoft doesn't
sell desktop software-it is in the desktop-software upgrades
business, which is why Windows 95 was a seminal marketing event
for it. Netscape, too, is in the software-upgrades business,
and now is facing its first major test with Navigator 2.0.

Netscape also is in the server/client business: give away clients
to drive server sales. And Netscape, in its short life, has
moved quickly from being Internet-driven to being "intranet"
driven.

The Netscape business model is at least understandable. More
problematic for analytic types are Internet content companies.
Many entrepreneurs at the conference were in the "spaghetti
strategy" mode-throw a lot at the wall and see what sticks.
From the audience, the suits ask: "Will you get your revenue
from advertising, transaction fees, subscription fees, merchandising,
software sales, systems integration or custom development?"

Jane Webpreneur responds: "Yes."

These are not businesses that fit nicely onto a spreadsheet,
or at least a spreadsheet that converges on a single number
for internal rate of return (MBAese for investment profit)

Though content models are vexing today, the Internet Service
Provider (ISP) model was not altogether clear when we invested
in Uunet. It took a lot of experimenting and strategizing by
management and investors to reach the point where the company
could make a profit. Many ISPs are still refining their models.

All of the early Internet winners are led by management that
moves fast, is flexible, willing to experiment and can quickly
spot winning strategies and rapidly focus resources on what's
working.

Very few large companies are run on this people model. That's
why entrepreneurs will continue to dominate the Internet until
the business models settle down.

Xylan Moves on Fast Track

By:
JOHN T. MULQUEEN

The local-area switching market is hot. Just look at the success
of Xylan Corp. over the past 12 months.

The Calabasas, Calif.-based company only began shipping its
switching product early in 1995. To help bring it to market,
the vendor sold 10 percent of its stock to an OEM partner,
Alcatel Data Networks, Reston, Va., in March 1995 for $10 million.

Xylan followed up that distribution deal with OEM contracts
with Networks Systems Corp., Hitachi Inc. and Digital Equipment
Corp. as well as the rapid expansion of its own operations.

The result has been explosive growth for Xylan, which reported
$14 million in sales through the first nine months of 1995
but expects to close out its books for the year with almost
$28 million in sales, said Douglas Hill, director of marketing
and a Xylan founder.

Just as important, Hill said, Xylan will be profitable for the
fourth quarter, after running in the red for the first nine
months.

A few good profitable quarters built on top of rapid revenue
growth usually precedes an initial stock offering. For its
part, Xylan reportedly is talking with several top investment
banking firms about an initial public offering sometime early
this year.

William Becklean, a securities analyst at Hanover Institutional
Securities Inc., a Boston investment firm, said Xylan can be
compared with San Jose, Calif.-based Alantec Inc., another
switch vendor, to estimate Xylan's market value. For the year
ended Dec. 31, the publicly traded Alantec is expected to have
estimated earnings of $10.5 million on revenue of $52.5 million.
The company recently had a market valuation of 8.4 times revenue.

On that basis, Xylan might command a market valuation of about
8.5 times revenue, or about $240 million, Becklean said.

Another analyst, who asked to remain anonymous, said $240 million
would be a good starting point, but Xylan would probably want
a higher valuation.

During the last round of venture capital financing, Xylan was
valued at about $200 million and the company would probably
want "to kick up'' the valuation to more than $240 million,
the analyst said.

Troops Benefit From Key Software

By:
JOHN T. MULQUEEN

A small Pittsburgh company is supplying the U.S. Army with a
key piece of software and professional services to provide
support to American soldiers in Bosnia.

Carnegie Group Inc. has installed its Knowledge-Based Logistics
Planning Shell (KBLPS) at three U.S. Army sites in Germany
to analyze and recommend solutions for military supply problems
in Bosnia. KBLPS uses a Unix 2.4 operating system running on
Sun Microsystem Inc. Sparcstations connected primarily to Ethernet
LANs, a Carnegie spokesman said.

Carnegie, a 12-year-old systems integration and software-development
company, specializes in developing client/ser-

ver-based applications that work with existing computer systems.
Carnegie derives more than 90 percent of its revenue from providing
services. Carnegie also licenses a small amount of software,
which accounts for less than 10 percent of its revenue.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, 1995, revenue was up 52
percent, to $19.1 million, compared with the same nine months
in 1994, largely because of an increase in software services,
which jumped 56 percent, to $17.9 million.

Most revenue from services came from an extension on a logistics
contract with the Defense Department and a contract with U
S West Communications Inc.

Carnegie has focused on the telecommunications, financial services,
manufacturing and defense markets. Its largest customers include
U S West, BellSouth Telecommunications Inc., Ford Motor Co.,
First USA Bank and the U.S. Army.

Ford is the largest shareholder in the company. Its 560,000
shares of common stock represent 9 percent of Carnegie's stock.
U S West owns 6.5 percent; Digital Equipment Corp. owns 5.6
percent and Texas Instruments Inc. owns 5.4 percent.

In November Carnegie raised $10.6 million in its initial public
offering, consisting of 2 million shares. The company sold
1.5 million of the shares and officers and other investors
sold the remaining 500,000 shares. The offering share price

Scopus Builds Help-Desk Operations

By:
JOHN T. MULQUEEN

Scopus Technology Inc. has rapidly built a business of selling
software that can be used for enterprise-wide help-desk operations,
to support sales and marketing operations and to automate product
design.

Revenue more than doubled to $12 million from $5.4 million for
the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with the same period
in 1994, which is close to the $15.25 million revenue Scopus
reported for all of fiscal 1994.

Scopus' product line consists of three applications packages
 SupportTeam, to handle customer support; Quality Team, for
product design; and SalesTeam, to handle marketing and sales
automation. Other modules and tools are responsible for communications,
data replication or customization of applications.

Prices of the application packages range from $12,000 to $120,000
per server and from $3,000 to $3,500 per user. Other modules
and tools are priced from $3,000 to $20,000.

Scopus, Emeryville, Calif., is developing HelpDesk for internal
help-desk applications and as an extension to SalesTeam to
handle field sales forces. Both are due out the first half
of 1996.

Scopus' products run on standard networking operating systems
and relational database management systems, except for Informix
Software Inc.'s Informix. Support for Informix will be added
early this year, a spokeswoman said.

But Scopus faces increasing competition from various vendors
and has had to call on outside systems integrators and consultants
to help it with larger projects.

Outside contractors are expensive and Scopus was unable to pass
along all the costs to its customers. Gross margins on service
and maintenance revenue fell to 7 percent from 42 percent for
the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with the same period
the year before.

Overall, net income for the six months ended Sept. 30 was down
42 percent to $227,000 from the $388,000 reported in 1994.

Scopus has hired Joan Beardsley as senior director of professional
services to manage those outside contracts, a spokesman said.

Ward Off Virus Invasions -- Central House's MimeSweeper helps
isolate infected documents

By:
JEFFREY SCHWARTZ

Central House Technologies Inc. this week will unveil software
to help administrators prevent viruses from invading their
networks from the Internet and from external electronic-mail
services.

MimeSweeper scans message attachments for viruses and isolates
any E-mail with files believed to contain infected documents,
said Joe Rohde, president of Central House, Plymouth, Calif.
The company initially will ship MimeSweeper for Lotus cc:Mail
networks or any Internet E-mail system based on the Simple
Mail Transport Protocol.

Later releases of MimeSweeper will support Microsoft Corp.'s
Microsoft Mail and Novell Inc.'s GroupWise office-automation
software, according to Rohde. MimeSweeper runs on a Windows
NT server and is connected to an incoming message gateway by
scanning all attachments prior to routing E-mail within the
corporate network.

"If the message is OK it is routed to the post office, but if
it's infected the message is quarantined and the administrator
is alerted,'' Rohde said.

The software interfaces with most anti-virus scanning applications;
multiple programs can be invoked, he added.

E-mail networks are susceptible to network viruses and network
managers often hesitate to implement defensive measures in
their networks until after they are hit by a virus, said Mark
Levitt, an analyst at International Data Corp., a Framingham,
Mass., consulting company. Levitt said one drawback to using
MimeSweeper is that it does not support encrypted messages.

"If you and I use encryption, MimeSweeper will consider it a
suspect message,'' Levitt said. "Encryption is not widespread
today, but as more companies start using encryption, this could
be an issue.''

Rohde said Central House plans to support encryption in future
releases.

Available now, MimeSweeper is priced at $2,850 for the first
100 users and $650 for an additional 100 users.

Central House can be reached at 209-245-5900.

Case Ventura, Net Detective: Buyouts & Binges In the New Year



Noon was just a few minutes away when I reached my office. I
paused at the door and my eye fell upon a small brown parcel
left lying on the walk. As I bent to pick it up, I heard heels
clicking behind me on the sidewalk. Rita Telco and Belle Nomour
wheeled up to me, their faces distraught.

"You don't want to go in there.''

They were trembling like network managers with massive investments
in Vines. What's the problem, I wondered?

I already had had a lousy week. I hate New Year's because it
means I am another year older. Plus, I ate too much during
the holidays and my stomach was as shaky as Lotus' ship dates
for Notes 4.0.

There are other things on my mind. For instance, I heard that
Hewlett-Packard was finally bringing its NetServer management
tools up to snuff for OpenView. Today, a user can set performance
thresholds, but the system won't say anything is wrong unless
it is specifically asked about it. So what was the point of
having performance thresholds? The new version sends an alert
to the administrator, just as in the current Windows version.

And Oracle is expecting a mid-January release of Oracle Lite,
a database for mobile users. It will sell for only $99 and
be a preview of Oracle8 with its handling of new data types.
Oracle built this object/relational hybrid database from the
ground up.

My secretary, Lotta Memory, also said Novell will partner with
Aurora Systems to bring telephony features to Novell's GroupWise
office-automation software. It's likely that the software could
be one of the biggest hits at the Computer Telephony Expo in
March.

Aurora makes FastCall, a middleware platform used by most telecommunications
companies to bring telephony features to Windows applications.
At the same show, Applied Voice Technology, a company that
makes LAN-based messaging software, will release a slew of
unified messaging products.

Then there are the year's first buyout rumors. From the deserted
gin mills of Wall Street, Caseworkers said they overheard that
Netscape Communications wants to acquire FTP Software.

Netscape would get a TCP stack, access to some major FTP customers
and some substance to go with its $5 billion capitalization.

I suddenly realized Rita had a bottle of my favorite scotch
tucked under her arm. Belle took the brown package from my
arms.

"You won't find a buyer for Novell in there, Case.''

I put the key in the lock and turned it. My office door opened
and I was shocked at what was on my desk.

Rash's Judgement: MY EDITOR MADE ME DO IT: GUESSING WHAT'S HOT IN NETWORKING 
THIS YEAR

By:
Wayne Rash Jr.

Given the mind-boggling frenzy surrounding the Internet last
year, I'm not sure if it's safe to predict what might come
to communications in 1996. I don't think anyone foresaw the
magnitude of the Internet's impact. Yet one way or another,
it's affected nearly everything in networking.

On the other hand, one of the tasks we columnists are saddled
with by our editors is to predict the future accurately. This
being my first column of the new year, I'm discharging this
awesome responsibility as quickly as possible. Besides, that
way, by the end of the year, no one will remember whether I
was right or not.

In any case, some trends are obvious, even if some of the moves
haven't been played out yet. For example, it's pretty clear
that the entertainment industry and the information industry
are developing a real synergy. The deal between Microsoft and
NBC Television is only one example, although it's probably
one of the more spectacular.

By this time next year, you can expect to see a considerable
crossover between entertainment and the on-line world. Of course,
that's already happened, as anyone can see when television
programs start flashing Uniform Resource Locators on the screen
along with the credits. What's going to change is that much
more of the actual content will cross over, and it'll be much
more substantial material than just being able to replay David
Letterman's Top Ten list. In effect, both Cyberspace and television
will become adjuncts of the other, meaning that people will
have to access both to get the full range of information from
either.

This merging will continue in other areas as well, but not all
of them will be positive. For example, cable-television companies
will start making a real push to provide access and bandwidth
to the Internet. Ask yourself, though, if you're willing to
wait for long, undefined periods of time for the cable-repair
technician to arrive when your Internet connection is down.
I know that if I had to depend on the companies here in the
Washington, D.C., area to provide access, I'd probably never
get on the Internet again.

If the company you work for still doesn't have Internet access,
expect that to change. The existence of the vast quantity of
information to be found on the Net will create its own demand.
Many companies will find that such access is a competitive
necessity. Being cut off from this rapidly swelling pool of
knowledge will be like doing without a stock wire or a business
news service. You can do it only in industries where information
and timeliness don't matter. Outside of the government, I can't
think of any.

Network managers will also be expected to contribute to this
rising tide of content. For example, if you run the network
at your company, you can expect to be asked to start supporting
a server on the World Wide Web if you don't already. If you
have that job now, you can expect it to get bigger, bringing
along a new level of involvement to staffers working with everything
from router maintenance to security firewalls.

Because of these pressures, few network managers will be in
a position to resist the demands for greater connectivity.
And those network managers who find ways to manage this connectivity
effectively will find their positions growing in importance.
Many of those managers will be having a very good year, indeed,
by the time 1997 gets here. Many of their suppliers-everyone
from Internet service providers to on-line security specialists
will have a very good year, as well.

Now, just promise me you won't go back and read this next January
and tell me how short- sighted I was. Remember, my editors
made me do it.

U.K., U.S. SLASH ACCOUNTING RATES -- Resale Era
Begins

    By DENIS GILHOOLY

         LONDON

   The economic tide has turned.

   Experts may quibble over what precipitated the change in pricing
international telecommunications services, but there is no turning back.

      The recommendation by the U.K. Office of Telecommunications to allow
simple resale of capacity on international circuits lays the groundwork for a
new bilateral agreement on international resale between the United States and
the United Kingdom, as well as for a web of such agreements between
countries.

   Resale promises to unleash a wave of price competition and choice in
international telecoms.

   Already, resale is exerting downward pressure on the accounting-rate
system by which countries divide their income from international services.

   In August, the decision to open the resale market between Canada and the
United States was followed by an almost halving of the agreed accounting
rate.

   And earlier this month AT&T and MCI Communications Corp. filed with the
Federal Communications Commission for substantial accounting-rate
reductions over the next three years with British Telecom and Mercury
Communications Ltd.

   Inevitably, the trend towardtotal market liberalization across the Atlantic
is exposing the worst distortions in Europe.

   Analysis to be released later this year by the European Commission
documents the disarray of intra-European tariffs.

   In what the Commission terms the ``frontier effect,'' users are forced
to pay, on average, two-and-a-half times more for an international call
than for an equivalent domestic long distance call.

   After conducting its own study, the Commission's competition
directorate decided further action is necessary. Directorate commissioner Sir
Leon Brittan said he will launch an investigation of international telecoms
pricing across Europe.

France Blazes Data Net Trail

    By ANDREAS EVAGORA

         TOULOUSE, FRANCE-France Telecom is building a series of
high-speed, fiber optic networks that will provide data communications to
specific industries and other communities in France.

   Having proven this custom-designed network concept with a backbone
linking research organizations in Sophia Antipolis, the operator is expected
to open its second such network this month, in Toulouse.

   This network will serve Toulouse's sizable scientific and aerospace
industries.

   France Telecom will also soon build a network for the medical community in
one French city and is looking to provide networks among banks and other
commercial enterprises.

   The networks will deploy compatible but not necessarily identical broadband
technology.

   The networks in Toulouse and Sophia Antipolis are likely to progress to the
fiber distributed data interface local area network standard, for example, but
the operator has not ruled out using metropolitan area networking technology
for subsequent networks.

   Francois Croisille, a France Telecom custom design manager, said the
operator may install between 15 and 20 such networks by 1992.

   The Toulouse network will be built with a fiber backbone and link eight
organizations' computer centers and LANs, initially at speeds of up
to 2 megabits per second. The second phase of the project will increase speeds
to 34 mbps.

   Georges Sans, divisional manager for networks at Centre National
d'Etudes Spatial, a user of the Toulouse network, said similar
networks are planned near Paris-to link France's Atomic Energy
Commission and the National Institute for Information Research-and in
Marseille and Grenoble, all next year.

SWIFT Sets New Agenda

    By DAWN HAYES

         oBERLIN-SWIFT, the networking cooperative of 2,000 banks
worldwide, will begin moving into new competitive service sectors this week as
it claims a contract to network an emerging European foreign exchange
system.

   The contract is expected to be awarded by the Exchange Clearing House
Organization, a group of 25 European banks building a common clearing house
for European foreign exchange, SWIFT officials said.

   ECHO would establish the first multilateral foreignexchange settlement
system in the world, in 1992. The networked computer system would
substantially reduce banks' administrative costs by replacing the
bilateral arrangements through which they now settle foreign-exchange
transactions.

   But the ECHO contract represents just one facet of SWIFT's broad
mandate to generate new services to thwart mounting competition.

   At their annual conference this month in Berlin, SWIFT officials also said
they hope to draw the corporate customers of the society's bank
members onto the SWIFT network, which would boost traffic.

   SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications,
also intends to move into the market for managed data network services.

   And a recent decision by SWIFT to use the EDIFACT standard for electronic
data interchange is key to its entry into a broader range of value-added
network services, according to David Birch, director of marketing at Hyperion
Systems Ltd., a Guildford, England, consultancy.

   With increasing competition in the financial services market, growth in
message volumes for SWIFT slowed in 1989 to 15 percent, from an average of up
to 20 percent in the previous five years.

   And signs indicate that growth will continue to slip unless SWIFT harnesses
a new competitive direction in the 1990s, a banking source said.

    ``Innovation may not pay,'' said SWIFT chief executive Bessel Kok,
``but non-innovation may lead to loss of markets.''

   The ECHO project, along with others SWIFT is considering, will take the
17-year-old not-for-profit organization beyond its core
business of interbank transfers for payments and statements transfers and into
a new commercial environment.

Alcatel Hits Back -- Italian Merger To Counter
AT&T

    By ANNE-MARIE ROUSSEL

         MILAN-A merger of Alcatel's Italian subsidiary with
the telecoms unit of Italy's Fiat SpA would hit AT&T in
the European markets where it is making the most headway: Italy and
Spain.

   The deal, disclosed this month, calls for Alcatel-Face to merge with
Telettra SpA.

   It is ``a direct answer to everything that AT&T has done in Europe for
the past two years,'' said Didier Pouillot, an analyst with French
research house Idate.

   By entering Italy through such a powerful player as Telettra, which has 33
percent of the local transmission equipment market, Alcatel appears to be
responding to last year's deal between AT&T and Italian
manufacturer Italtel SpA.

   In addition, Alcatel will inherit Telettra's 45 percent share of
the transmission equipment market in Spain-another country AT&T
is starting to penetrate, through the sale of public switches. Just last
month, the U.S. manufacturer opened a new switching plant near Madrid.

   On a more global level, Alcatel is now in a position to overtake AT&T
as the world's largest telecoms equipment manufacturer. As Pouillot noted,
Alcatel's 15 percent annual growth rate is well above that of AT&T's
equipment business, which is close to zero.

    ``I expect that Alcatel will be ahead of AT&T by the end of 1990,''
Pouillot said.

OPTIMISM TEMPERED

   But such anticipated results are tempered by the potential of a political
backlash in Italy. The Alcatel-Telettra deal has dashed the hopes of
state-run industrial group IRI, the holding company for Italtel. IRI had
long been negotiating to merge Telettra with Italtel into an entity to be
called Telit.

   The agreement between Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, Alcatel's
parent company, and Fiat has prompted sour comments from IRI president
Franco Nobili. ``This agreement will make it more difficult to form
national industrial poles [in Italy],'' he was quoted in the Italian
press.

   Italy, which in 1988 embarked on a five-year, $43.5 billion
program to upgrade the country's telecoms infrastructure, was
expected to award Telettra about one-third of the transmission equipment
contracts.

   But the Italian government could decide to pull back, following the same
route the United States took recently when France's Groupe Bull SA
bought the computer operations of Illinois-based Zenith Electronics Corp.
Following the purchase, the U.S. government decided to renegotiate all its
contracts with Zenith.

   The new Alcatel-Telettra entity-to be based in Milan and owned 75
percent by Alcatel, 25 percent by Fiat-is to be formed by the end of next
month.

   With the addition of Telettra, Alcatel must now expand into developing
areas, particularly mobile communications, said Christopher Thomas, an analyst
with London's Systems Dynamics Ltd.

   Telettra's transmission specialty includes mobile communications
systems. It supplied Italian operator SIP with a 900-megahertz analog
system, and has contracts to supply part of the network infrastructure for
trials of the Italian, Spanish, Swiss and U.K. links of the planned GSM
pan-European digital cellular system.

SOME FIBER SYSTEMS TO BE COMBINED -- Asian Cables
Plotted

    By ROBERT POE

         SINGAPORE-Network operators from 12 countries have signed
agreements on construction and maintenance of the first three links of the
planned ASEAN optical fiber cable system.

   An official also revealed that parts of the system will be combined with
other cables planned for the Asia-Pacific region, to improve connectivity
and save costs.

   The US $320 million system, planned to link the six members of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) by 1995, will connect with
other systems to provide fully fiber optic undersea routes to both Europe and
North America.

   Besides those from the ASEAN nations of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Singapore, carriers from Australia, Canada, Japan, South
Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States signed the ASEAN
system agreements.

   Singapore Telecom president and chief executive officer Wong Hung Khim said
the first link covered by the agreements, connecting Kuantan and Kota Kinabalu
in different parts of Malaysia, is due to be completed in December. A link
between Brunei and Singapore is to begin service late next year. The cable
connecting Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines will be commissioned in the
first quarter of 1992, Wong said.

   In addition, he said, the Malaysia-Singapore link of the ASEAN system
will be part of the recently integrated Aspac-Kyutai system
(CommunicationsWeek International, 3 September). Aspac-Kyutai,
now called APC, will link Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and two
points in Japan starting in mid-1993.

   The Indonesia-Singapore 2 link of the ASEAN system will be part of the
SEA-ME-WE 2 cable planned to connect Southeast Asia, the Middle East
and Europe. A Malaysia-Thailand cable will complete the system.

Shakeup At ETSI -- Users Lose Important Voice In
Standards

    By JENNIFER L. SCHENKER

   SOPHIA ANTIPOLIS, FRANCE-Users appear to have lost the chairmanship of
a key technical committee at the European Telecommunications Standards
Institute-a development that could have broad implications for user
involvement in the European standards-making process.

   At press time it appeared that Business Telecommunications Committee
Chairman Jan Thurmer would be replaced by either Benoit Gasztowtt from
France's Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications or by Bjorn Hansen
from the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration. Gasztowtt was supported
by Alcatel, Siemens AG and other manufacturers; Hansen, by public network
operators and L.M. Ericsson.

   The Business Telecommunications Committee is charged with formulating
standards for private and public networks and attached terminal equipment.

   ETSI Technical Committee Director Stephen Temple asked Thurmer to resign
his position and instead head a new brainstorming group that will look at how
to get users more involved in ETSI activities.

   The immediate result of his new job, however, is that users are losing
direct involvement in standards.

   Thurmer, the network manager at Nordsk Hydro AS, an Oslo-based
chemical, oil and retailing group, was the only user chosen to head one of
ETSI's 12 standards committees. Representatives from telecoms
administrations or manufacturers run the other 11 ETSI technical
committees.

   Manufacturer officials questioned whether users belong in the chair
position.

   ``A user is not interested in what is inside a machine, he is
interested in what it can do,'' said Gerard Robin, who is
responsible for Alcatel's standards activities worldwide and vice
chairman of ETSI's adhoc group on rules of procedure.

   Robin said PBX manufacturers have supported their own candidate not
because they want to promote a particular solution but because ``we don't
want to again go through the pains of having a chairman who is not in a
position to understand all the problems.''

   He said a good compromise solution would be to appoint a user as vice
chairman.

ETSI EVOLUTION

   ETSI, created in 1988, took over some of the work from the Conference of
European Postal and Telecommunications administration (CEPT). Until
ETSI was formed, users and manufacturers did not have decision-making
power on standards, which were usually decided on in secret by
administrations.

   A user serves as vice president of ETSI's general assembly, but
since the organization still remains heavily dominated by CEPT it was also
considered important to have direct user influence on technical questions.

   As in other ETSI committees, the Business Telecommunications Committee
comprises manufacturers and operators often favoring divergent approaches to
critical networking questions.

   When ETSI selects the new chairman of the committee, ``I hope the
person who will get the job will try to be objective and concentrate on the
technical job and not be steered by the administration or company he works
for,'' Thurmer said.

   Thurmer was nominated as a candidate for the Business Telecommunications
chairmanship by the International Telecommunications Users Group and has held
the position since May 1989.

   But his travel expenses between Norway and France and the time required by
the ETSI chairmanship put a strain on his company, he said.

   INTUG proposed another candidate, the network manager of a major Dutch
corporation. That candidate's company is reportedly prepared to bear
the expenses involved.

RULES MAY FACILITATE PRIVATE NETS -- Germany
Reregulating

    By JOHN BLAU AND KAREN LYNCH

         BONN-Deutsche Bundespost minister Christian Schwarz-Schilling has
drafted new regulations that could ease the establishment of private
networks and competitive services in Germany.

   The regulations, to go into effect in July, would implement the policy
initiatives included in the German telecommunications reform law of last
year.

   While the law called for competition in all but basic telephone service,
users and potential competitors have continued to complain that Deutsche
Bundespost Telekom, the German operator, has been blocking competition and
refusing to bring its tariffs in line with costs.

   DBP Telekom was given two years from the signing of the reform bill to
adjust its commercial terms to the new competitive market. But industry
sources say Telekom has not been moving fast enough in this direction.

   Now, Schwarz-Schilling has asked industry and users to comment on a
broad range of regulatory proposals. The draft includes such competitive
conditions as a guarantee that all private operators would be assured the same
tariffs and conditions as DBP Telekom when leasing lines for value-added
network services.

   Schwarz-Schilling also proposes a removal of the limitations on voice
channeling and voice compression over data lines and a narrower definition of
the network monopoly in terms of transmission and network termination, making
many of the interfaces, such as X.21, competitive.

   In a separate development, he also launched a debate to define which
mandatory services DBP Telekom must provide ``in the public
interest, particularly on account of its obligation to make services and
facilities available to the general public.''

   At issue is whether DBP Telekom would be obliged to continue to provide
services that are unprofitable.

   Related issues include the means by which Telekom would be allowed to cover
the costs of unprofitable services, and the possible sharing of those costs by
competitors.

   Schwarz-Schilling is circulating a list of questions, seeking comment
from national and international sources by mid-November.

   While the debate now focuses on such services as telex and telegram,
Schwarz-Schilling's questions pave the way for a larger debate
on the obligation to provide telecoms services nationwide under uniform terms
and conditions, rather than provide such services only where they are
profitable.

   Among his questions:

   o What should be the criteria for deciding whether a new service is of
an infrastructural nature, and thus has to be declared a mandatory
service?

   o What service features should be included in the regulation of
mandatory services (for example, nationwide coverage, uniform tariffs
throughout the service area, quality, compatible standards and
rates)?

   o What should happen to services that do not cover costs?

OSI MAY NEVER OVERSHADOW SNA -- Is IBM
Committed?

    By MALCOLM LAWS

         LA GAUDE, FRANCE

   IBM's facility in La Gaude is one of only two
manufacturer-owned laboratories in Europe approved for testing whether
products conform to Open Systems Interconnection standards. Similar labs are
typically run by specialist, independent organizations.

   IBM suggests the facility shows its commitment to open systems, not just
its own Systems Network Architecture. But the company's position on
standards remains ambiguous, despite its recently stated commitment to
improved OSI support.

   Opinions vary.

   Laurent Halphen, secretary of SHARE, a European group of 506 IBM users,
said at the organization's biannual conference in Paris last month
that it is significant that IBM now starts its announcements with talk of open
systems, evidence that it is listening to its customers.

   But Peter Rigg, managing consultant at Logica plc, in London, said
``OSI still comes second and quite a long way behind
SNA.''

   Once reluctant to embrace standards, IBM has had to change its stance in
the face of customer demand for open networks. Yet critics say that despite
the greater prominence IBM gives to open systems, its proprietary systems come
first. They say that until big IBM users demand OSI-a prospect some years
away-it will remain in the background. It does not help that IBM has not
produced list prices for its OSI products.

   IBM promises to offer wide-ranging support, not just for OSI and SNA,
but also for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, widely seen as a
practical interim step toward OSI.

   Before long, IBM could well earn much of its money building networks that
link its own computers with those from rivals like Digital Equipment Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co., using OSI protocols as well as SNA and TCP/IP.

IBM'S OSI BATCH

   Last month, IBM ushered in a new batch of OSI products
(CommunicationsWeek International, 1 October). They are designed,
for the first time, to run across all IBM's strategic Systems
Application Architecture operating systems: MVS and VM on mainframes;
OS/400; and OS/2 Extended Edition on the Personal System/2 workstation. Some
of the OSI programs are available now, while the rest will be phased in over
the next 12 months.

   SHARE's Halphen said the September announcements ``addressed the
greater part of what we asked for'' in OSI products.

   IBM has replaced its original Open Systems Network Support and Open
Systems Transport and Session Support programs with its new
OSI/Communications Subsystem. Over this runs the X.400 Open Network
Distributed System-with gateways into the Professional Office System
(Profs) and Distributed Office Support System (Disoss) and OSI File
Services, an implementation of the OSI File Transfer Access and Management
standard.

   Where previously IBM's OSI programs could access only X.25 wide
area packet switching networks, the new OSI range will also have routes across
integrated services digital networks and standard token-ring, Ethernet,
token bus and fiber distributed data interface LANs.

   But IBM is not a convert to standards as a cure for all computing ills.
Some manufacturers are moving to drop their own data communications
architectures in favor of OSI, and others, notably DEC, say they will give
equal prominence to standard and proprietary architectures. IBM has
consistently argued that it does not make sense to drop SNA, which remains,
the company says, the best way to link IBM systems.

    Jeff Hosier, a director of Xephon Ltd., a Newbury, England,
consultancy that specializes in IBM, said ``any IBM user would be off his
trolley to get too deep into OSI,'' because SNA is so much richer and
readily available.

OSI RELUCTANCE

   All IBM mainframe OSI programs run on the Virtual Telecommunications Access
Method, the main SNA software subsystem that controls session and resource
management across the network, for wide area communications. No native OSI
implementations are possible for remote links between IBM mainframe operating
systems, at least as far as IBM is concerned.

   Logica's Rigg said that although it is possible to bypass VTAM, it is
not worth the effort. VTAM is a stable, widely understood and
sophisticated system, he said, although it is expensive and can slow down
sessions where it has to process OSI protocols. ``VTAM offers a consistent
programming interface and it is the last SNA component I would encourage
users to move away from,'' Rigg said.

   Direct connection of IBM computers to LANs is through the 3172
communications controller. Again, remote mainframe sessions must go via VTAM
and IBM's Network Control Program's Packet Switching
Interface for X.25, or the 7820 ISDN adapter.

   John Westgate, an independent consultant who advises the U.K. Department of
Industry and edits a guide to OSI products, said he is impressed with
IBM's open systems efforts. And because governments have so much
buying power, when it comes to open systems especially, what IBM does to
please them is important-not just for itself, but for supporters of the
open systems cause.

   But continued differences from one country to another in the way OSI is
implemented also means that IBM can justify its continued support for SNA.
Xephon's Hosier said SNA, as a communications standard, ``is as strong as,
if not stronger than, OSI''-a point IBM is unlikely to contest.

Foreign Carriers Vie For Teleport

    Foreign telecoms carriers have been vying for entry into the North
American carrier market by seeking a stake in Merrill Lynch &
Co.'s Teleport Communications Group, based in Staten Island, New
York.

   The group, which operates metropolitan area networks in New York and other
U.S. cities, has been rumored to be up for sale for several months.

   Sources close to the negotiations say Japan's Kokusai Denshin
Denwa, France Telecom, British Telecom and Cable & Wireless plc have
all met with Merrill Lynch in an effort to work out a deal.

   Most, however, have balked at Merrill's asking price, said to be
in the $175 million to $200 million range.

Hong Kong's CT2 Plans, Bidders

    Hong Kong Postmaster General Dominic Wong said he expects to select
three or four of the six consortia that bid to operate CT2 service in the
territory. But on 28 September, the deadline for submitting bids, Wong
said he hoped for ``imaginative'' proposals and that he is open to
persuasion.

   Most of the bids were from consortia with significant overseas
participation. Most planned to spend HK $300 million to HK $400 million
(US $38 million to US $51 million) on infrastructure over five years.

   Hong Kong Telecom CSL, the value-added services arm of Hong Kong
Telecommunicatons Ltd., teamed with Star Paging (Holdings) Ltd. and SHK
Industries Ltd., a company backed by the territory's leading property
developers. Hutchison Telecommunicatons Ltd. subsidiary Hutchison Paging
bid jointly with Motorola Inc. and Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. A
group called Personal Communications Ltd. is backed by locally listed
First Pacific Co. (with a 50 percent interest in one of the territory's
three cellular operators), British Telecom, paging company ABC
Communications and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd.

   Meta Communications combines interests controlled by local entrepreneur
Dickson Poon with Beijing-owned China Resources (Holdings)
Ltd., Onwel Strategic Holdings and BellSouth Enterprises Inc. Chevalier
(OA) International Ltd., a local conglomerate, formed a joint
venture with OTC International of Australia. Singapore Telecom International
Pte. Ltd., in partnership with Steamers Telecommunications Ltd., also of
Singapore, formed a Hong Kong joint-venture company called Halkis Ltd. to
pursue a CT2 license.

    A seventh submission, made by GEC-Plessey Telecommunications Ltd.,
was not an application but a series of observations on the application of CT2
in Hong Kong.

Fujitsu's Euro-Focus

    By ANDREAS EVAGORA

         STOCKLEY PARK, ENGLAND-Fujitsu Ltd. is putting Europe at the
forefront of its telecommunications strategy, forming its first European
telecoms research and development center to participate more in local
standards-setting and equipment development.

   Fiber optics and mobile telephony will be the Japanese manufacturer's
two main research focuses in Europe, said Sir Brian Tovey, chairman of
Fujitsu Europe Telecom R&D Centre Ltd. The creation of FTRC, in Stockley
Park, allows Fujitsu to ``build its telecoms strategy on a European
base,'' he said.

   In the area of standards-making, Fujitsu will apply to join the
European Telecommunications Standards Institute. It will likely be
accepted so long as it shows a ``legitimate interest in European
telecommunications,'' said Frede Ask, deputy director of ETSI. He said
Japanese suppliers NEC Corp. and Panasonic are already ETSI members.

   FTRC, Fujitsu's seventh European subsidiary, will also develop
for the European market equipment based on the international Synchronous
Digital Hierarchy standard. SDH, also known as Synchronous Digital Network, or
Sonet, allows multiplexed data transmission over digital networks for local
access systems.

   Specifically, Fujitsu plans to develop its Fiber Loop Multiplexers, which
it now sells in Japan and the United States, for sale to large European
network operators, said Akira Miyata, general manager of the
company's overseas transmission systems division. ``We are
very confident [of supplying SDH] if we can compete equally with
local suppliers,'' Miyata said.

   British Telecom, which recently pulled back on its strategy for
purchasing flexible access systems-an alternative to SDH-will be Fujitsu's
first target customer, Miyata said. Fujitsu's European drive into telecoms
coincides with its pending purchase of International Computers Ltd. from
STC plc-which itself was to have been BT's supplier of flexible access
equipment.

   Fujitsu chairman Takuma Yamamoto, in a recent interview, said the Japanese
company will likely expand in Europe through partnerships with locally based
manufacturers.

   Fujitsu is already active in Europen telecoms. Its contract to supply
undersea optical cables for a 500-kilometer link between England and
Germany, due to be completed in July, marked the first such success in Europe
by a Japanese manufacturer. Fujitsu also supplies transmission systems, and
makes facsimile machines and modems in Malaga, Spain, where it will also
produce small PBXs beginning next year.

   Fujitsu spent $375,000 to set up FTRC. It plans to recruit up to 30
researchers in the center's first year of operation, which begins
later this month.

   Fujitsu has no plans to set up telecoms manufacturing facilities in the
United Kingdom, said FTRC director Hachihei Kurematsu.

CEPT Begets ECTRA

    By JENNIFER L. SCHENKER

         LONDON-A new group representing telecoms regulatory authorities
from 31 countries is making European policy on licensing procedures for
value-added services, international accounting principles and satellite
and mobile communications its top priorities.

   The European Committee on Regulatory Affairs (ECTRA), a group created
as part of the radical structural reform of the Conference of European
Postal and Telecommunications administrations, formally set its working
agenda for the next two years during an extraordinary meeting in London
late last month.

   ECTRA was created under the reorganization of CEPT, which includes the
separation of operational and regulatory functions (CommunicationsWeek
International, 12 March).

   The idea is for ECTRA to be staffed by independent government
representatives. However, the majority of Europe's public network
operators have yet to separate their own regulatory and operational
functions.

   In the meantime, most of ECTRA's staff members are being drawn from
national telecommunications ministries, with some ``wearing two hats,''
said committee chairman John Rietbroek, who is director of policy affairs
and deputy head of the department of telecommunications and post at the
Dutch Ministry of Transport and Public Works.

ECTRA's new working agenda includes:

   o drafting proposals for common harmonized licensing and declaration
procedures for private value-added network service operators before the
end of 1991;

Germany Postponing Telepoint

    The Deutsche Bundespost has postponed until next year its issue of private
telepoint licenses.

   Wolf-Joachim Zeidel, director of mobile communications licensing at
the Bundespost, said that licensing procedures for paging and trunked radio
communications must be completed before introducing telepoint.

   Telepoint, a cordless personal communications technology, lets users make
calls outside their homes to base stations located in busy public places.
Users near these stations are then linked to the public network.

    DBP Telekom is conducting telepoint field trials to test the CT2 and
CT1-plus cordless telephone systems. A third trial, for a combination of
the technologies, was cancelled ``for scheduling reasons.'' It is thought
the incompatible analog CT1-plus system has little chance of being picked
following DBP Telekom's decision to sign the memorandum of understanding
on the CT2 common air interface.

Trading Tangled In Technology

    Two U.S. agencies that oversee the nation's financial markets
should update rules and merge to cope with the rising use of technology by
financial institutions, says a report issued by a congressional agency.

   Traditional trading methods are under increasing stress from rising
volume, the Office of Technology Assessment said in ``Electronic Bulls and
Bears: U.S. Securities Markets and Information Technology.'' Frequent
trading of large blocks of stock and ``program trading''-using computers
to buy baskets of stocks-complicate the volatility.

   The office recommended that the Securities and Exchange Commission and
Commodity Futures Trading Commission merge or be replaced by one agency to
alleviate conflicting policies.

The Underside Of French `Reform'

    A draft of France's new telecommunications ``reform'' contains
potential stumbling blocks for service providers.

   The draft, which the French Parliament is due to review this week, is
supposed to open the markets for X.25 packet switching and ISDN services to
competition by 1993. However, it proposes that tariff restraints be placed on
competitors. It also says value-added services providers competing with
France Telecom should ``make a contribution to education, training
and research'' and raises the possiblity of access charges
for interconnection to the public network.

    Another provision says the amount of capital held in French VANS providers
by a non-European Community investor cannot exceed 20 percent unless an
international treaty or agreement exists to allow it.

Competition Guidelines Debated

    The European Commission's competition guidelines will be a hot
topic at an informal meeting of Europe's telecommunications
ministers in Rome on 18 October.

   Member states are said to be upset by the competition guidelines, which are
intended to set rules for commercial behavior in the sector and guard against
monopoly abuses by the telecoms administrations. France filed a petition with
almost 100 objections at a meeting of the Commission's Senior
Officials Group on Telecommunications earlier this month.

Argentine Network Deal Falls Apart

    By DAVID ROCKS

         BUENOS AIRES-After months of bickering and negotiating,
Argentina's government finds itself in exactly the same place it started:
operating one of the world's worst phone companies.

   The country's Empresa Nacional de Telecommunications
(ENTel) was to be split into two zones and handed over on 8 October
to private operating groups headed by Spain's Telefonica and Bell
Atlantic Corp.

   But Manufacturers Hanover Trust Corp., the U.S. bank that spearheaded Bell
Atlantic's bid, did not come up with the financing by the Argentine
government's 4 October deadline.

   So when the deadline arrived, the government forbade Bell Atlantic and
Manufacturers Hanover from taking control of the northern zone. Telefonica
then declined to assume management of the southern portion until northern
ownership is clarified.

   The government has given a group headed by Italian telecoms holding company
STET and France Telecom unit France Cables et Radio a chance to run ENTel
north in place of Bell Atlantic.

   The European group, which includes Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., has until 1
November to come up with financing and an operating plan.

   The privatization of ENTel, a company perhaps best known for its poor
service, is a key to President Carlos Menem's economic plan. The two
portions were to have fetched a total of $214 million in cash and more
than $5 billion in debt.

   The Bell Atlantic consortium was to have presented the Argentine government
with $100 million in cash and Argentine debt paper worth some
$2.3 billion for a 60 percent stake in the northern zone.

   But the bid started falling apart in September, when Manufacturers Hanover
could not line up enough bank support, U.S. bankers in Argentina said.

   Carlos Agote, head of Manufacturers Hanover's Argentine
operations, and Bell Atlantic International president C. Hyde Tucker said they
remained hopeful that the Bell Atlantic group could be allowed back in.

   Joe Goldman contributed to this story.

Shinto Sentenced

    By Robert Poe

         TOKYO-Hisashi Shinto, the 80-year-old former chairman
of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., was convicted last week of bribery in
the insider-trading scandal that deposed a number of Japanese
politicians.

   He was given a two-year suspended sentence and fined about
$175,000.

   Shinto was arrested in March 1989 and charged with accepting
low-priced stock of a subsidiary of information and publishing
conglomerate Recruit Co. before it was released for public sale. He then
resold the stock at a profit. In return, Recruit received favors from NTT that
benefited its leased-line resale business.

   Although most of Japan's leading politicians at the time had
similar dealings with Recruit, which eventually ruined their careers, none
were arrested. Observers said Shinto served as a scapegoat.

   The scandal forced Shinto to resign in December 1988, several months before
his arrest. NTT president Haruo Yamaguchi, Shinto's hand-picked
successor, had to take over sooner than expected.

COMMISSION LAUNCHES COMPETITION INQUIRY -- Tariff
Liberalization On Move

    By DENIS GILHOOLY

         LONDON

   Reform of the pricing structure for international telecommunications
services has taken on a momentum of its own.

   The proliferation of transoceanic fiber optic cables and growth rates of 15
percent to 20 percent a year in cross-border traffic have driven the
industry toward new regulatory arrangements on tariffs, accounting rates and
leased circuits far quicker than expected.

   The ground rules are being rewritten daily and the old order, under which
cooperative agreements were conducted within an exclusive club of monopoly
operators, is under siege.

   The proposed cuts in the accounting rate between the United States and
United Kingdom, for example, mark a major break with tradition by involving
four separate international carriers and two national regulatory agencies.

   The present accounting-rate structure was sharply criticized last year
by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
which charged it inhibits the growth of information services and restricts
international trade (CommunicationsWeek International, 27 November
1989).

   The OECD found no stable relationship over time between the accounting rate
(a negotiated sum split between the two carriers for each international
call), the prices charged to the customer, and the costs of providing the
service.

   A lack of transparency in accounting procedures and artificially high
rates, the OECD said, gives little incentive to lower tariffs.

EXTRA-TERRITORIAL

   In addition, it penalizes high traffic volume, growth in international
traffic, and low-cost operators, the organization said. As a result,
AT&T, for example, is running a trade deficit of more than $2
billion on its international telephone business, effectively subsidizing its
rival carriers. In 1988, the U.S. deficit with Mexico was $410 million;
$153 million with West Germany.

    The chronic U.S. deficit prompted the Federal Communications Commission to
issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the Regulation of International
Accounting Rates in August. The deadline for reply comments was Friday, and
though these may influence the final outcome, the FCC's stated
position remains controversial.

   The ``reform'' package is designed to slice $1 billion of the deficit,
leading to cuts in U.S. international calling prices by perhaps as much as
50 percent.

   The FCC asserts that, under the U.S. Communications Act of 1934, it has
``broad authority to regulate international telecoms services,
including international accounting rates.'' This posture
has led to charges of extra-territoriality.

   Critics argue that by dictating accounting rates, the FCC would not only
encroach on commercial decisions of telephone operators, but also be putting
unacceptable pressure on foreign countries.

   ``We might test the powers of the Communications Act,'' said FCC
Chairman Alfred Sikes. ``This has not been done before, but the FCC
intends to act aggressively in the area of accounting rates.''

   Sikes said a major factor in ``undermining fictitious accounting
rates'' would be to open the market for international simple resale of
telecoms services on a bilateral basis.

   In March, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications
Commission liberalized resale and shared use of private-line services.
This meant that foreign callers using international private lines can access
the U.S. domestic telephone network and pay only the U.S. domestic rate plus
the cost of the international private line.

   AT&T subsequently complained to the FCC that this arrangement
undermined the entire accounting-rate system, permitted foreign carriers
to avoid settlement payments, and could result in one-way bypass.

   In late August, the Canadian authorities agreed to allow the
arrangement northbound as well as southbound. They also negotiated a
significantly lower accounting rate on all ``reduced'' and ``standard''
voice traffic between the two countries.

NO COINCIDENCE

   Moves by U.K. and U.S. carriers to negotiate a new international
accounting rate coincide with a recent recommendation by Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director general of the U.K. Office of Telecommunications. He
proposed that international simple resale of telecoms services be
permitted with countries that also allow it for calls to and from the
United Kingdom.

   Carsberg intends resale to be one way of stimulating more competition on
international calls. The other will be by capping British Telecom's
rates for international calls and its charges for international private
circuits. Both international resale and price capping will be considered as
part of the United Kingdom's forthcoming duopoly review.

   Simple resale involves the hiring of a private circuit from a telephone
company and using it to set up a competing service.

   ``Resale has been on the cards for years,'' said Iain Vallance,
chairman of BT. ``The worry would be if it was not done on a reciprocal
basis between countries. That would certainly be a bad deal for the U.K.''

   Though BT, Mercury Communications Ltd., AT&T and MCI Communications
Corp. have been in discussions for a year, the timing of their proposals
for a new accounting rate between the United Kingdom and the United States
reflects both the Oftel announcement on resale and last week's reply
deadline for the FCC inquiry.

   However, major differences exist between the proposals. AT&T, MCI
and Mercury have agreed to a single rate that will reduce the current
per-minute accounting rate from $1.06 to $0.76 by January
1991, falling to $0.40 by January 1993. But Mercury intends to abolish
its current off-peak rate.

   By contrast, AT&T, MCI and BT have agreed on two rates. The full
rate will be reduced from the current $1.06 to $0.76 by January
1991 and $0.44 by January 1993. The current off-peak rate will be
cut from $0.76 to $0.48 by January 1991 and $0.35 by
January 1993.

   ``We think the Mercury proposal to have a single rate is retrograde and
not in the interests of customers,'' said Adam Scott, BT international
affairs director.

   Mercury's low penetration of the residential market means it is
disadvantaged in offering very low off-peak rates.

   In fact, second-tier carriers such as Mercury and MCI will probably be
the hardest hit by international resale. While AT&T and BT, for
example, can weather fierce price competition because of their market shares,
the likes of Mercury and MCI have until now been winning market share by
undercutting the dominant carriers.

   A freer regulatory climate will also allow the larger carriers to be more
aggressive on price and in repackaging services for bulk discounts and virtual
private networks. If global VPNs are to flourish, more flexible international
accounting rates are essential.

   Just when telecoms resale between the United Kingdom and the United States
will begin depends on the outcome of the duopoly review, but discussions are
also underway between those countries and Japan and Sweden.

EUROPE NEXT?

   The pace of developments in the more liberalized markets is both exposing
gross tariff distortions in mainland Europe and placing pressure on the
European Commission to act.

   In March, the Conference of European Postal and Telecommunications
administrations withdrew a controversial recommendation on principles for the
use of leased lines and the establishment of private networks-after being
advised by the Commission's competition directorate that the plan
amounted to a price agreement, restricted competition and breached Community
competition law.

   This action established a powerful precedent for the way leased lines
are priced and provided Europe-wide. And through tough new ``Competition
Guidelines'' the Commission is expected to adopt this year, it is
challenging the anti-competitive implications of the D-series
recommendations of the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative
Committee. The D-series currently sets pricing and supply conditions for
international leased circuits.

   Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner of competition, said the
Commission's  preliminary examination confirmed gross international
tariff distortions, but not necessarily evidence of a telephone company
``cartel.''

   ``There is prima face evidence, not of a conspiracy, but there is
something curious,'' Brittan said. ``So we are
launching a more formal investigation on prices to see what causes these
irrational, inexplicable and disturbing
discrepencies.''

DUOPOLY REVIEW Second Of A Series -- Cable Operators
Take On BT

    By DAWN HAYES

         LONDON

   Betting that the upcoming U.K. telecoms duopoly review will loosen
restrictions, cable TV operators at home and abroad are challenging British
Telecom's domination of local-loop telephone service.

   United Artists International, in partnership with U S West Inc., has been
granted approval by the Office of Telecommunications to run telephone service
to U.K. homes and businesses within its franchise area. And Canadian telecoms
holding company BCE Ltd. has applied to Oftel to initiate its first foray into
local telephone service in the United Kingdom, in partnership with Canadian
cable TV company Le Groupe Videotron.

   Only four of 135 cable TV operators in the United Kingdom offer telephone
service in what Oftel director general Sir Bryan Carsberg calls
experiments: Windsor Television Ltd., Cable Camden Ltd., East London
Telecommunications Ltd., and now United Artists.

   But more and more are expected to do so should Oftel ease local-loop
restrictions in its duopoly review.

   Cable companies already are allowed to provide all telecoms and datacoms
services; they must, however, be switched by either BT or Mercury
Communications Ltd.

   The U.K. Cable Television Association contends that present regulations
make it difficult for users to switch from one of the two main carriers to
cable TV operator networks. Users must add new, separate phone numbers to make
calls through a cable provider and must buy new wiring to change
operators.

   Despite today's constrictions, United Artists, a $1.2 billion cable
television and cinema company based in Denver, Colorado, this month
launched limited integrated services to business customers in Croydon and
to residential customers in Sutton.

   But Peter Streames, marketing operations manager, said phase two will
extend the service to many more customers in its franchise areas, depending,
that is, on the outcome of the duopoly review.

   In what observers interpret as the clearest indication yet of what his
position on cable television will be in the forthcoming duopoly review,
Carsberg last month pointed to cable TV as a key to unlocking the cozy
BT-Mercury telecoms duopoly.

    He said restrictions on cable TV companies must be reassessed but that in
return they may have to accept some form of universal-service obligation,
providing full service to residential customers and the more lucrative
business accounts.

INDUSTRY PROPOSAL

   Michael Storey, director of corporate strategy and public affairs at
Videotron, said the industry has proposed that cable TV companies be able to
lay their own networks free of BT or Mercury, interconnect with one
another's networks, and opt not to provide service to everyone in
their franchise areas.

   Still, the industry says it is willing to strike a balance to open the
local network to competition.

   There's incentive to compromise. So far cable television has
disappointed regulators and investors alike.

   Broadband cable television was first licensed in the United Kingdom in
1983, but only 0.5 percent of U.K. homes are connected to broadband cable,
according to London consultancy Enator Ltd.

   Beyond regulatory constraints, the cable TV companies have encountered
competition from other television distributors, including direct broadcast by
satellite. In addition, the removal of favorable tax incentives in 1984 slowed
the rate of cable construction over the last decade.

   Chris Akers, a London-based media analyst with Citicorp Investment
Bank Ltd., maintains that a shift in local-loop restrictions could boost
cable industry profits 10 percent.

   According to a recent Citicorp report, 90 percent of the United Kingdom
will have access to cable by December 2000, and 45 percent of homes will be
connected, assuming Oftel allows cable television companies to offer telephone
service without consent from British Telecom or Mercury.

FRESH BLOOD

   The Broadcasting Bill, which goes through Parliament this month, could give
the industry an infusion of fresh blood. It is expected to further free
restrictions on ownership of cable companies, enabling U.S. companies to fully
own and operate U.K. cable subsidiaries for the first time.

   Technology is a driving force behind the cable company push into
telecommunications. Fiber optics offers the high bandwidth needed for
integrated communications, thus blurring the boundary between broadcast and
telecoms.

   Meanwhile, the combined revenues from cable TV and telecoms services
strengthens the economic incentive for replacing copper wire in the local loop
with fiber optics.

    This was the conclusion of a government-sponsored study into
television funding in 1986. Called the Peacock Committee Report, it
recommended that British Telecom build and operate a national fiber optic grid
network, financed in part by the government.

   However, the proposal was at odds with the Conservative government's
free-market policy, which opposes public funding of large infrastructure
projects. The subsequent development of the mobile communications market
under the government's competitive policy further weakened the Peacock
Report's recommendations.

    A follow-up report, called the MacDonald Report, recommended that the
national grid approach be abandoned in favor of competition in the local
network from cable and mobile communications, driven by market demand.

BT MOVES

   BT itself invested in the cable TV industry over the last seven years but
plans to dispose of all those interests by the end of the year. BT says it
already has a local network and does not need to duplicate it with a cable TV
infrastructure.

   A BT spokesman said the move also relates to a drive to cut non-core
businesses.

   Kristen Hansen, with consultancy Enator, believes BT's goal is to
get out of cable television as a bargaining chip to persuade the government to
allow it to run entertainment services over its public network.

   BT argues that if the cable TV operators are given carte blanche to compete
in telecoms, Oftel must allow the former monopoly to compete on a commercial
basis in entertainment services.

   Currently, BT is permitted to carry broadcast television only so far as TV
companies' transmitters.

   This week, BT will launch a pilot integrated telephone/television service
in the Bishops Stortford area. The company has a special license to run the
service to test demand.

   Carsberg said BT would be permitted to provide entertainment services, but
emphasized that such a move would have to be timed to give cable television
companies a head start.

   While observers say this is a likely post-duopoly review scenario, the
timing remains in question.

   For Mercury's part, cable television could be the answer to criticism
that it failed to penetrate the local telephone service market other than
over BT's network.

   At the moment, to reach customers in areas not accessed by its fiber optic
trunk system connecting the major U.K. cities, Mercury sends calls via the BT
network.

   Mercury would like to see some restrictions on the cable companies freed,
but it does not want them to operate independently of either U.K. telecoms
operator. This way, Mercury can extend its reach via the cable company
networks.

   The cable television association maintains, however, that using cable to
extend Mercury's network amounts to extending the current duopoly.
Mercury does not favor introduction of additional trunk carriers.

OBSERVERS OPTIMISTIC

   For all the back and forth, industry observers are optimistic about cable
television's foray into telephony.

    Citicorp's Akers said he is confident that the duopoly review
will look favorably on cable television companies because there is presently
next to no competition in the local loop.

   ``They deserve some payback,'' Akers said.

   Meanwhile, the cable companies can only mull over Carsberg's
cryptic comment: ``Every referee knows there's no
such thing as a level playing field, only one in which both teams are playing
uphill.''

EDITORIAL -- Lines Of Resistance

    The recommendation by the U.K. Office of Telecommunications to open the
market for international simple resale of telecoms services is a
watershed.

   Its true impact may not be seen for a decade, but, if adopted by the U.K.
government, it would spell an end to the old order.

   In essence, it would undermine the regime of cozy, cooperative
relationships between national telecoms carriers that has underpinned the
industry for more than a century. It would signal the beginning of the end of
the accounting-rate mechanism between carriers that has propped up that
regime. And it would herald a new era of tariff arbitrage where the battle
between service suppliers would be for the delivery of end-to-end
telecoms services, delivered door-to-door.

   Equally important, international resale would allow large users to break
free of existing supplier relationships and, if they choose, engage in network
bypass for the first time. All business users, meanwhile, would quickly reap
the benefits of increased price competition.

   Everywhere, the cracks are beginning to show in the structure of
international telecoms tariffs. And the growing awareness that international
tariffs are not even remotely related to the cost of providing service is
reflected in a range of policy initiatives:

   o In Europe, the European Commission's competition directorate is
questioning the legality of long-standing International Telegraph and
Telephone Consultative Committee tariff recommendations under European
Community competition law. Separately, its telecoms directorate is
expected to issue a communication on voice telephony, leased-line and data
tariffs later this year.

   o In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission last
Friday received comments on its proposals for reforming the international
accounting rate system, which sets the negotiated sum between two carriers for
each international call. AT&T has already negotiated a major
accounting rate reduction with Canada. Both AT&T and MCI
Communications Corp. have now proposed major reductions with British Telecom
and Mercury Communications Ltd.

   o In Japan, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications'
introduction of equal-access arrangements for competitive carriers has
led to a substantial loss of market for former monopoly Kokusai Denshin Denwa.


   To some extent, these initiatives reflect different priorities. The
principal concern of the FCC is to reduce the telecoms portion of the U.S.
trade deficit. The European Commission is attempting to foster a
Europe-wide telecoms space before the opening of the single market
post-1992. Oftel and Japan's MPT are looking to increase
competition in their markets.

   But behind them all is an economic dynamic that can no longer be
denied.

   The dramatic growth in international telecoms traffic during the 1980s and
the impact of new technology are driving the industry toward new regulatory
arrangements on tariffs, accounting rates and leased lines.

   Already, the line of resistance against sweeping price reductions on
international tariffs is proving impossible to hold. And the expected
bilateral agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States on
international resale would place intense pressure on Europe's
monopoly operators to follow the same course.

   Overall, however, the present situation is inherently unstable and the
balance between an orderly transition and a market free-for-all is
looking increasingly fragile.

   On the one hand, it invites the abuse of monopoly power; on the other,
price cutting and uneconomic entry by new competitors that may impair
long-term industry investment.

   Multilateral reform of the present system, although preferable, will likely
take years. Meantime, the instability that has become the hallmark of
today's telecoms industry will continue to hold sway and progress
will be made primarily through bilateral agreements.

PERSPECTIVE -- Break Down Barriers

    By COLIN LONG

         Current national rules in all European countries other than the
United Kingdom and Germany will usually serve to prevent value-added
services from being retailed to end-users.

   In an era when most of the talk is of liberalization and of European
Commission initiatives to open up telecommunications markets, this might seem
surprising, but the reasons are simple.

    Under the cloak of national rules and international recommendations
preventing the use of leased circuits for the simple transport of data, such
services are treated as an infringement of the telecoms
administration's local monopoly and therefore are prohibited.

   Only where a substantial value-added service element can be
demonstrated will the ban normally be avoided.

   Even the Commission's recent directive on competition in telecoms
services may not get to grips with this problem. The Commission has accepted
that leased lines should be treated as a special case and that telecoms
administrations should not be obliged to allow simple resale services until
1993 at the earliest.

   The Commission definition of ``simple resale'' is the provision of data
transmission over leased lines as a ``separate service,'' including such
switching, data storage and protocol conversion as is necessary for
transmission in real time to and from the public switched network.

   This rather vague definition begs the question as to the status of a
bundled value-added or managed data network service. It may also differ
markedly from the comparative approach in individual member states.

   While messages may not currently be transmissible over privately operated
data communication networks with public connections, one message is
clear: Anyone offering an international managed data network service and
the benefits of one-stop shopping will have to be prepared to take on the
more recalcitrant telecoms administrations and use European treaty competition
rules and the European Commission to help break down the barriers.

   The real effects of the Commission's service directive may be
some years away. Meantime, these competition rules could accelerate
deregulation.

   In particular, once telecoms administrations begin to cooperate to provide
one-stop managed services, it will be difficult to prevent
non-telecoms administration service providers seeking the same
arrangements.

FACILITIES MANAGEMENT COMPETITION ON RISE -- New
Carrier-Industry Force

    By JENNIFER L. SCHENKER

         LOUVAIN-LA-NEUVE, BELGIUM-The French and Belgian
telecoms administrations and datacoms equipment manufacturer Groupe Telinfo SA
have formed a company to offer international facilities management
services.

   The company, called Eftel SA, underscores the developing competition for
lucrative facilities management business between Europe's
telecommunications administrations and traditional value-added network
service providers, such as Electronic Data Systems Corp. (EDS).

   Facilities management embraces everything from purchasing all of a
customer's computing and networking operations, including the staffs
that run them, to monitoring the traffic on a customer's network to
make sure it is configured properly.

   The main activities of Eftel, based in Louvain-la-Neuve, a suburb
of Brussels, will be consultancy and engineering services and network
operation in the form of facilities management or value-added
networks.

   Eftel partner France Cables et Radio, a unit of France Telecom, has
experience in consultancy and engineering. Besides basic telephony,
Belgium's Regie des Telegraphes et Telephones (RTT)
provides communications services such as packet-switched data and
integrated services digital networks.

   Studies show that 20 percent to 30 percent of European communications users
would consider letting a third party run their network.

   ``I see battles looming between major players in facilities management
without a PTT member, and those PTTs who have taken the bit between the
teeth directly or indirectly through a technically based company,'' said
Roger Barber, manager of the telecommunications forum at the Butler Cox
Foundation, in London.

   British Telecom recently announced its intention to offer global facilities
management services through its BT Tymnet Inc. unit, bringing it into
competition with other European telecoms administration in their home
markets.

   In the case of Eftel, Barber said, ``a very powerful company has
been created which taps the resources of the PTTs and the resources of Telinfo
itself.''

   Telinfo, based in Brussels, was formed in August from the merger earlier in
the year of Telindus SA, a Brussels-based manufacturer of modems and
multiplexers, and Informabel, a Belgian systems integrator (see
box).

   Telinfo general manager Jean-Marie Polet said Eftel gives his company,
which already has a close supplier relationship with the RTT, immediate access
to the international customer base of the Belgian and French telecoms
administrations.

CUSTOMERS LINED UP

   The joint-venture company's first customers are Citicorp
Luxembourg, which awarded Eftel a contract to upgrade its existing networks,
and the Belgian National Bank, which has asked Eftel to evaluate tenders for a
local area network installation in the bank's offices.

   Eftel's current business is mostly in Belgium but the company is
hoping to expand internationally.

   Eftel general manager Daniel Brismee said the company wants to build an
organization like SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunications, a consortium that links banks and other financial
institutions worldwide. Eftel wants to work with industry-specific groups
to build up specialized international VANs, he said.

   If Eftel concentrates on specialized business sectors, Butler
Cox's Barber said, it should be better positioned than other VANS
providers, such as EDS. The alliance of public network operators with
equipment suppliers puts them in a position of strength, he said.

   ``This is an important marketing tool in the armory of the PTT
marketeers,'' Barber said. ``Now they can say, `We can provide you with
the lines and the services and run them for you.' But this implies a
greater understanding of business requirements than PTTs have classically
demonstrated.''

   But because public network operators generally have difficulty getting
close to user needs, Barber said, Eftel could turn out to be a
``technically sound company without a great deal of business
acumen.''

Merger Is Part Of Industry Trend

    By Jennifer L. Schenker

         The merger in Belgium of modem and multiplexer manufacturer Telindus
SA with information technology company Informabel SA reflects the European
trend toward computer-communications alliances.

   The merger of Telindus and Informabel formed Groupe Telinfo SA, which
offers data communications and computer applications products and develops and
manages network solutions, said Jean-Marie Polet, Telinfo general
manager.

   He said the company's strength over competing software houses and
telecoms equipment manufacturers is its ability to offer customers complete
computer and communications solutions.

   Such user demand has led to similar mergers, said Richard Mitchell, an
industry analyst at Dataquest Ltd., of Denham, England.

   For example, London-based Psion plc, a maker of hand-held computer
terminals, formally merged with London communications company Dacom
Systems Ltd. and became Psion Dacom plc last month. Similarly, the
Chippenham, England, information technology division of diversified
aerospace company Dowty Group plc acquired the Danish local area network
systems company Dataco AS in June of this year.

   ``I think corporate users expect to see and like to have one-stop
shopping,'' Mitchell said. Invitations to tender cover modems, X.25 packet
switches and a host of computer-related items, meaning the pressure is on
companies to offer expertise in many areas.

   ``If a company can provide only 70 percent of the contract and
somebody else can do all of it, and take into account maintenance of the whole
thing, it is obvious who is going to come out ahead,''
Mitchell said.

   Telindus, which has expertise in wide area networks, local area networks
and message handling systems, has subsidiaries throughout Europe and is
present in both the Asia-Pacific region and the United States.

   Informabel, a software provider with competence centers for different
computer environments and for specialized business sectors such as banking and
industry, has subsidiaries in France, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, Morocco and
Tunisia. It is setting up subsidiaries in four more European countries, as
well as Zaire and Brazil.

   The merged company, Telinfo, is concentrating on business opportunities in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

   It is also vying for contracts to provide the Portuguese telecommunications
administration with multiplexers and controlling software for a new digital
network, general manager Polet said.

Germany Offers ISDN Incentives

    By John Blau

         BONN-Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, looking to stimulate demand
for its nationwide ISDN, has launched an incentive program that includes
bonuses for first-time users.

   From 1 October to 31 December, the German network operator is offering the
following bonuses:

   o DM 444 ($300) for basic rate access with call-transfer and at least
one ISDN telephone;

   o DM 888 ($600) for basic rate access with call-transfer, an ISDN
telephone, in addition to access to the analog cellular telephone or
paging networks and a videotex connection;

   o DM 888 for basic rate access with four ISDN telephones and one
terminal adapter or an ISDN teletex terminal; and

   o DM 2,000 for users of existing or new ISDN-capable PBX units
with one or more interfaces.

   The four-part program comes on the heels of DBP Telekom's
promotion of ISDN PC adapter cards, aimed at achieving mass-market
penetration of ISDN services.

   Since April, those in Germany that sign up for basic rate access and also
buy a PC card are given a DM 888 credit on their phone bill.

   The German network operator retreated from its plan to distribute free
cards last year after drawing sharp criticism from the industry, which viewed
the free promotion as anti-competitive.

   DBP Telekom has also been stimulating interest in ISDN by developing
applications with German companies.

French Look At Audiotex

    By Anne-Marie Roussel

         PARIS-Responding to pressure from French audiotex phone-service
providers, France Telecom has created a new audiotex division, whose
director, Jean-Paul Maury, will recommend changes in 18 months for
promoting the industry.

   Maury is considered the father of France's Minitel videotex
system.

   Service providers have argued that France Telecom's tariff and
access rules for audiotex hamper development of their phone services. Audiotex
is most commonly used in France for banking, making reservations, placing bets
and ordering goods from catalogs.

   Basic audiotex services deliver taped messages, while more sophisticated
versions establish a dialog between a caller and a voice-activated
computer.

   Aftel, the French association of audiotex providers, wants France Telecom
to make its tariff structure more flexible and its policy for obtaining lines
less bureaucratic.

   In a recently published white paper, Aftel says the only two tariff options
France Telecom makes available are toll-free numbers and
semi-toll-free numbers (whereby the cost is equally shared by
the caller and the service provider). Aftel would prefer more
options.

   In addition, because the application process is bottlenecked, no new lines
have been made available, said Aftel president Jean-Luc Lenart.

   France Telecom intends to develop audiotex cautiously, said Jean-Claude
Mailhan, director of commercial and telematic affairs. He said the French
operator wants to avoid repeating its videotex experience-whose rapid
growth spurred the proliferation of pornographic services over Minitel.

HONG KONG OFFICIALS LOOK TO FUTURE -- Telecoms Views
Mixed

    By ROBERT POE

         HONG KONG

   Telecoms officials and users in Hong Kong disagree sharply over the
territory's future as a regional communications hub.

   Top-level officials with the territory's dominant telecommunications
operator and regulatory body say the prospects for Hong Kong continuing as
Asia's main communications hub could not be brighter. But according to one
major user, the British colony's return to Chinese control on 1 July 1997
presents potentially enormous problems, and Hong Kong may already be
losing its regional telecoms edge.

   ``As far as we are concerned, it is just another date,'' said Mike
Gale, chief executive of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. ``It should
continue as it does today. It's a change of sovereignty, but in terms of
the ability to come and go, of currency, of free trade and so on, it'll
continue just as it is today.''

   Although China International Trust & Investment Corp. owns 20
percent of Hong Kong Telecom, the Chinese government institution does not take
an active management role, Gale said.

   Postmaster general Dominic Wong, who is in charge of both postal and
telecommunications regulation in the territory, agreed with Gale's
assessment. ``It [1997] is still a political date as such,'' he said. ``In
terms of our planning and expectations, it has never featured in a very
significant way.''

   Users are not reassured, however. ``If you have a company that
has its telecoms hub in Hong Kong, if you've got everything running
out of Hong Kong, as a lot of companies have, then if the Chinese decide to
march into Hong Kong and shut it down in 1997, the company would go out of
business,'' said David Manion, communications manager for
Asia at Reuters South East Asia Ltd., in Hong Kong.

   Although few are convinced this will happen, Manion said, failing to guard
against the possibility means ``gambling the whole of your Asian
business.''

POLITICAL RISK

   Manion, who is head of the Hong Kong Telecommunications Users Group, said
most major communications users are giving at least some consideration to
moving facilities elsewhere.

   The political risk is one reason Reuters moved a major telecoms
technical center to Tokyo. ``You can leave people here, because they can
get on the next plane,'' Manion said, ``but as far as physical facilities,
you have to look at diversifying.''

   Another reason for the move was what Reuters perceived as a decline in
Hong Kong's competitive advantage as a strategic telecoms location-the
result, according to Manion, of modernization by other nations in the
region.

   ``Hong Kong was until a few years ago without question the
telecommunications center of the Asia-Pacific,'' he said. ``But over the
last few years they haven't moved. The rest of the region has, and they've
started to catch up, and in some cases they've overtaken them. I think
Singapore has overtaken Hong Kong. They're building up their advantage all
the time.''

   Hong Kong Telecom's Gale disagrees, noting that 60 percent of the
company's phone calls now go through digital exchanges. All
exchanges are to be digital by 1994. ``I don't think there
are many places that can match that,'' he said.

   Gale said Hong Kong Telecom will spend about HK $3 billion (US
$385 million) both this year and next to expand and modernize.

   Furthermore, Hong Kong is ahead of Singapore in setting up international
communications over undersea optical fiber cables, he said. ``A
customer now who's looking for a fiber optic link to Europe or the
United States can get it out of Hong Kong today,'' Gale
said. Singapore has no fiber optic cables operational for international
telecoms service, he said.

   But this advantage will not last for long, Reuters' Manion noted. The
SEA-ME-WE-2 (Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe) cable, stretching
from Singapore to Marseille, France, is expected to be operational by
1994.

   ``That's got to be important,'' Manion said. ``By then they will have
the whole network linked along the Pacific Rim. The ideal choice would be
one route [in each direction]. Total diversity is the name of the game.''

GEOGRAPHIC ADVANTAGE

   Another Hong Kong advantage, according to Gale, is geographic. Besides its
position as a gateway to China-``the great potential market of
the future''-Hong Kong is also more central to the
Far East as a whole, he said.

   The advantages of location, however, are being eroded or perhaps even
negated by other developments in the region, according to Manion.
``Before, when there was only one position used as a hub, Hong Kong was
always very well positioned,'' he said. ``But now Tokyo is offering itself
as a hub, and it's got a lot going for it, because the first fiber cables
across the Pacific are based in Tokyo, and because of prices.''

   Prices on international routes out of Japan have dropped substantially
since the introduction of competition in October 1989-Reuters' second
major reason, other than the politics of 1997, for moving its technical
center to Tokyo. ``We believe that where it exists, competition must make
the environment more friendly to the user,'' Manion said.

   Tokyo's problem is its geographic position at the top end of the
Asia-Pacific region, Manion said, the solution to which is to have a
smaller hub farther down.

   ``If you put it in Hong Kong, it's only one stop down the road,'' he
said. ``But if it's in Singapore, it's very well positioned geographically
to serve all of Southeast Asia. So if you go for this sort of diverse
hubs, Hong Kong seems to fall between them. It seems to be caught in a
trap.''

UNDENIABLE ADVANTAGE

   But Manion added that the colony does have one undeniable advantage over
both Singapore and Tokyo: experience, which helps when it comes to
sorting out problems on the other end of the network connection.

   One of Reuters' major problems is getting the Japanese to deal
internationally rather than just looking after themselves. ``They haven't
really caught onto the game they're supposed to play,'' Manion said. ``If
there's a problem somewhere at the other end, they tend to report it to
the other end, and then sit back and say `that's my job done.' ''

   Corporate telecoms managers can be certain, as they ponder Hong Kong's
future as a communications hub, that their decisions will not come easily.
``Hong Kong's a great place,'' Manion said. ``Nobody wants to leave it.
But you have to assess the risks and take reasonable precautions if you're
a responsible businessman.''

Nynex Breakup Considered -- Agency Suggests Divesting
Phone Company Unit

    By DAWN BUSHAUS

         NEW YORK-The New York Public Service Commission, reacting to
alleged business improprieties at Nynex Corp., is investigating the structure
of the Bell company and the possibility of divesting its New York Telephone
Co. subsidiary.

   The New York PSC is the first U.S. state regulatory commission to look at
divesting a Bell operating company from its regional holding company
parent.

   The decision came at the suggestion of William Cowan, the commission's
general counsel, in a report issued this month examining alleged Nynex
business improprieties in Florida.

   Lawrence Friedman, former vice president of purchasing at Nynex Materiel
Enterprises Co. (MECO), was fired in 1988 for his reported role in
organizing Florida parties at which officials allegedly brought prostitutes
for suppliers and took part in other questionable business practices.

   In his report, Cowan said the alleged improprieties, combined with earlier
allegations that MECO had overcharged Nynex's two operating
companies, are reasons to consider divesting New York Telephone.

   Nynex chairman William Ferguson said the company will cooperate with
the PSC investigation, but said divestiture of New York Telephone ``is not
an option.'' A company spokesman said Nynex would challenge a divestiture
order in court.

   Most users said they do not believe a divestiture of New York Telephone
from Nynex will solve any problems.

   ``I think the whole situation-the regulated side buying from the
unregulated side-needs closer auditing, but I don't necessarily believe
divestiture is the answer,'' said Ronald Kopitowski, telecoms director at
the Metropolitan Transit Authority and president of the Communications
Managers Association.

   ``The user community wants good service in a stable environment,'' said
Henry Levine, partner with Morrison & Foerster, a Washington law firm that
represents several large communications users in the financial-services
industry. ``If divestiture would advance that, then users would give it
their support, but if it would retard that, they likely would not support
it.''

   In a related matter, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and
Nynex reached an agreement this month resolving FCC allegations that
Nynex's unregulated MECO unit had excessively charged the regulated New
York Telephone and New England Telephone & Telegraph Co. units for
equipment and services. The overcharging was alleged to have occurred from
1984 to 1988 as part of a scam to pad Nynex profits.

   The two Nynex operating units have agreed to cut interstate access rates by
$35.5 million and pay the U.S. Treasury $1.4 million. In return,
the commission will drop a proceeding against the two companies without
concluding that they violated FCC rules.

   Meanwhile, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, which
regulates New England Telephone, will keep a close eye on the New York PSC
investigation, said Susan Tierney, a DPU commissioner. The DPU has ordered an
audit of transactions between New England Telephone and MECO.

HIGH-SPEED AHEAD FOR US SPRINT, MCI -- Carriers
Emphasize Data

    By ROBIN GAREISS

         SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA-Communications users with applications
that demand high-speed data transmission welcomed this month's
announcements by US Sprint Communications Co. and MCI Communications Corp.

   US Sprint is the first U.S. long distance carrier to disclose plans to
provide a frame-relay service, aimed at satisfying growing user demand
for high-speed packet switching.

   Meanwhile, rival MCI unveiled a family of high-speed data services
that initially will give users access to T1 and DS-3 circuits on an
as-needed basis.

   Both carriers made their announcements at the Tele-Communications
Association's conference in San Diego this month.

   US Sprint said it will offer a frame-relay service late next year. The
initial rollout will provide only data services.

   Frame relay-a faster method of packet switching-can transmit
information at the T1 speed of 1.544 megabits per second. But unlike X.25, it
does not offer error correction, switched virtual connections or access
control. X.25 switches at lower speeds, however.

   As a public network operator, US Sprint will provide the link for users
who want to build hybrid private-public networks. US Sprint's frame-relay
network is intended to complement the SprintNet X.25 packet switching data
network. Ultimately, frame relay will provide access to broadband network
services.

   ``Overall, Sprint is setting itself up in this bandwidth-on-demand
marketplace as a leader,'' said Berge Ayvazian, an analyst at The Yankee
Group, in Boston. He said he expects MCI to announce a frame-relay service
based on Northern Telecom Ltd. technology.

   Although specific pricing is not yet available, it is expected that US
Sprint will charge users a fixed rate with usage-based charges for peak
periods.

   US Sprint's fiber optic network and Telenet Processor/III 4900
packet switches will support the system. US Sprint will use Integrated Packet
Exchange switches from StrataCom Inc. and market them as US Sprint's
TP7900 packet-based multiplexers for future voice, video and data
applications.

   US Sprint officials said users have not demanded frame-relay voice
services, so the initial rollout will contain only data components. In later
phases of frame relay, US Sprint will offer voice and video services, said
Floyd Trogdon, senior vice president at US Sprint Data Group.

      The frame-relay service initially will be available in the United
States, Japan and the United Kingdom and later extended to other European
countries.

MCI OFFERING

   MCI's Initial Virtual Private Data Service offerings will let
users transmit data at switched T1 and DS-3 (45-mbps)
speeds.

   The service, which will not be generally available until mid-1991,
marks the first time switched T1 and switched DS-3 are available through
a high-speed, virtual private network, MCI officials said. MCI will
devote a portion of its public network to VPDS offerings.

   AT&T has not dedicated a portion of its network to its virtual
private data network, the Software Defined Data Network. And the highest speed
AT&T has committed to with SDDN is 384 kilobits per second.

   Many communications managers at the largest U.S. companies want switched T1
services, especially for cases where they transmit heavy amounts of digital
traffic on an irregular basis, such as for videoconferencing.

   ``We cannot afford the dedicated facilities to handle full-motion
video,'' said Ed Forhan, communications manager at The Walker Group, a
chain of retail stores based in Westminster, Colorado. ``Any service that
gives small companies the ability to have video service is a big
benefit.''

   MCI must still determine which switching and billing systems it will use
with the VPDS.

   Some analysts questioned the timing of the announcement because MCI could
not provide detailed plans for the service's implementation.

FCC Gets Input On PCN Proposals

    By KATHLEEN KILLETTE

         WASHINGTON-Personal communications services are natural
extensions of cellular technology and so the United States must let the
cellular industry take the lead in introducing them, according to many of the
comments submitted this month to the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission.

   The FCC began an inquiry in June into PCS-the American term for
personal communications network (PCN) services. In its inquiry, the
FCC sought comments on the amount of spectrum needed for PCS, the types of
technologies that should be given priority, the technical standards that
should govern PCS and the degree to which providers should be regulated.

   The FCC also proposed excluding telephone companies and cellular mobile
radio licensees from providing PCS in areas they already serve, to ensure that
the fledgling market is open to entrepreneurs.

   Telephone companies and mobile service providers disagreed with that
proposal. ``The exclusion of these qualified participants would
needlessly limit the availability of PCS,'' stated GTE
Service Corp.

   The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association said the cellular
industry already offers efficient, affordable, lightweight, two-way
personal communications services via portable cellular phones, and that
several cellular companies are poised to initiate PCS trials.

   Those experiments, the CTIA stated, should lay the groundwork for the FCC
in measuring the need for PCS spectrum.

`DISTINCTION ARTIFICIAL'

   Nynex Corp. agreed, adding that the FCC ``should recognize that
any distinction between cellular and PCS would be highly artificial and that
the success of the cellular operations in the 800- to 900-megahertz
range should not be `truncated' by allotting too many resources
to PCS development.''

   Nynex plans to introduce the first wireless Personal Telephone Service
early next year in New York City.

   Telocator, a Washington-based association that represents paging and
cellular companies, opposed the FCC's proposal to use spectrum now
reserved for advanced paging frequencies-in the 930- to 931-MHz
range-for PCS.

   Manufacturers also weighed in on the PCS issue. Northern Telecom Inc.
stated as top priorities the establishment of a common numbering plan,
fostering network interoperability and efficient bandwidth utilization, and
prevention of interference. It proposed an open standard-called personal
communications interface (PCI)-for low-power, wireless
PCS.

   PCI, based on the CT2 standards being considered in Canada, would rely on
two-way communications channels and separate common channels for call
setup signaling. This approach would use bandwidth more efficiently, and give
users faster call setups and longer battery life for portable cellular phones,
Northern said.

   Apple Computer Inc. noted that the PCS proposals presented to the FCC have
focused mainly on voice communications, and recommended the allocation of
spectrum to ``Data-PCS.''

   Apple proposed allocating frequencies in the 1.7- to 2.3-gigahertz band
to be used exclusively for high-speed data communications within office
buildings, linking laptop computers via low-power transmitters.

Fujitsu Boosting U.S. Switch Effort

    By ROBERT POE

         RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA-Fujitsu Ltd. is boosting efforts to
adapt its digital exchange to the U.S. network, in anticipation of the
$40 billion public switch changeout expected to take place in the
United States over the next 10 to 15 years.

   Fujitsu plans to increase the number of U.S. staffers in charge of selling
and engineering the Fetex-150 switch to 600 by 1994 from the current 100,
company officials in Tokyo said.

   The increase will shift development of sophisticated switch features to the
United States from Japan, said one observer familiar with the
Raleigh-based subsidiary.

   Officials at Fujitsu Network Switching of America Inc. disclosed few
details.

   Most of the current staff there are working on testing the performance and
network conformance of software developed in Japan, the observer said. With
the expansion, the subsidiary will take on responsibility for developing
functions and capabilities required by U.S. customers.

   The Fetex-150 is Fujitsu's export-model exchange switch, with more than
8.8 million lines installed or on order in 17 countries. None have been
sold in the United States, but the recently announced plans confirm
longstanding speculation that the Japanese manufacturer is planning a
major push into the U.S. market.

   When Fujitsu won a major switch tender in Singapore last autumn,
competitors complained the company was selling the equipment at cost to win a
prestigious contract that would serve as a stepping stone to the U.S.
market.

   Fujitsu said its switch has passed Phase 1 and 2 evaluations by Bell
Communications Research Inc., the research arm of the seven U.S. Bell
companies.

   Although the certification is considered essential to selling to the
Bells-which account for about 75 percent of U.S. telephone lines-it
may not be enough for Fujitsu to break into a market dominated by
AT&T and Northern Telecom Inc.

   The two manufacturers have more than 90 percent of the U.S. market. A share
like that, coupled with Bell company inertia in changing to new suppliers,
leaves foreign public switch manufacturers largely out in the cold, analysts
say.

   The U.S. subsidiaries of Siemens AG, L.M. Ericsson, NEC Corp. and GEC
Plessey Telecommunications Ltd. have found the U.S. market tough to crack,
though each has had limited success and are further along than Fujitsu.

   ``There's an inherent conservatism on the part of their [U.S.] customer
base,'' said Robert Rosenberg, director of analytical services at The
Eastern Management Group, in Parsippany, New Jersey. ``These are huge
companies with billions of dollars invested in their current equipment.

   ``Even if Fujitsu comes up with a switch that has all the bells
and whistles that an engineer could ever want, if all the support systems have
to be rebuilt in order to fit that switch into the network, his manager
won't let him install it,'' according to
Rosenberg.

First Telmex Bidders Step Forward

    By DAVID ROCKS

         MEXICO CITY-U.S. Bell company Nynex Corp. and
Canada's BCE Inc. have teamed with a Mexican partner to bid for
operating control of Mexico's telephone network.

   The two companies plan to join Casa de Bolsa Inverlat Associates, a Mexican
investment group, in their bid for Telefonos de Mexico SA.

   The Mexican government plans to sell its 20.4 percent controlling interest
in Telmex, with bids due 15 November. Although several groups are expected to
tender offers, the Nynex-BCE-Inverlat consortium is the first to go
public with its intentions.

   Telmex, with some 5.5 million access lines in a country of 88 million
people, is a highly profitable monopoly and is considered to have enormous
growth potential.

   The winning bidder will, however, face a daunting task in upgrading service
and modernizing the network, much of which dates to the 1960s.

   ``There is a lot of room for improvement in their service,'' said
Eugene LaBorne, a Nynex International official working in Mexico City to
put the bid together. For example, he said, some 1.2 million people are
waiting to have a telephone installed.

   Forty percent of Telmex stock consists of voting shares. The Mexican
government now controls 51 percent of those shares, while the rest of the
company is held by private investors.

OWNERSHIP DETAILS

   The government is seeking to sell its stake-20.4 percent of the
total-to an investment group controlled by Mexicans.

   Inverlat will control 51 percent of the consortium, while BCE and Nynex
will likely split the balance, LaBorne said.

   Representatives of BCE, the Canadian telecoms holding company that includes
Bell Canada and Northern Telecom Ltd., and Nynex, which provides New York and
New England with phone service, are in Mexico working out the details of the
bid, LaBorne said.

   The market value of Telmex stock is about $7 billion, so the 20.4
percent stake for sale should fetch about $1.4 billion.

   Laborne said the government's selection will likely hinge as much
on each bidder's service and network-improvement plan as on the
cash offered.

   As a U.S. Bell company, Nynex will face regulatory impediments should its
consortium be selected. The AT&T divestiture agreement prohibits the
Bells from carrying long distance phone traffic in the United States, which
means Nynex would not be allowed to handle U.S.-bound calls from
Telmex-the bulk of the company's international business.

   Nynex believes the problem is surmountable, LaBorne said.

   There is some precedent for a waiver of the rule. Bell Atlantic Corp. and
Ameritech, Bell companies that recently bought a stake in Telecom Corp. of New
Zealand, have been allowed to participate in Telecom's
U.S.-bound calling business.

UNIVERSITY PLOTS BROADBAND NET -- Fiber To
Cambridge

    By MALCOLM LAWS

         CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND

   Next summer the medieval architecture of Cambridge will be networked by
one of Europe's most advanced broadband fiber optic communications
systems, thanks to Cambridge University.

   The 2.5 million ($4.7 million) Granta Backbone Network will offer
voice, data, image and video transmission for staff and students at 79
sites, most of which comprise the 31 semi-autonomous colleges that make up
the university.

   Because the university is spread throughout the city, lacking a central
campus, it was granted a special telecoms license by the Department of Trade
and Industry that allows it to lay its own lines for private voice and data
communications.

   A forthcoming government telecoms duopoly review could open the way for
Cambridge to sell commercial services, but the university would not speculate
on what might be possible.

   The GBN is part of Project Granta, a fourfold computing strategy approved
by the colleges in October 1987. The strategy comprises the University
Network, the mainframe, distributed computing and personal computer
systems.

   The colleges agreed on an outline for the backbone network in early 1989.
Implementation will start next month and is due to be completed by June. STC
plc's cable products division is to build the network.

   The GBN has been designed with a mix of present and future industrial,
social and educational needs in mind, according to the university.
Although regulations limit GBN use to within the university and its
various agencies, such as the Cambridge University Press and the local
schools examination board, ``if it were legal, decent and honest, we'd do
anything,'' said David Hartley, director of the University Computing
Service for 20 years.

   In anticipation of new services GBN has ``sufficient spare
capacity for increased and new forms of communication traffic where
needed,'' Hartley said.

   A copper coaxial cable and three types of fiber-62.5-micron and
50-micron multimode and a very-high-capacity 8-micron
monomode-will be laid in one duct and there are two more empty ducts.

   The copper cable will replace the digital leased lines now used for the
university's private X.25 network, linking more than 100 Ethernet
segments and for the private PBX voice network. Hartley estimates the GBN will
immediately save the university 70,000 a year just in replacing the leased
lines used for data.

   Uses for the various fibers have been left open. At first the 62.5
micron U.S.-standard fiber may support the 100-megabit-per-second fiber
distributed data interface local network technology, shortly to be
ratified by the American National Standards Institute. The 50-micron fiber
will carry Ethernet.

   Both may later support 140-mbps dual queue, dual bus metropolitan area
networking, for voice, data and video, once the standard has been finalized.
The 50-micron fiber, standard in Europe and Japan, has been chosen to
support applications that are still being researched, at Cambridge and
elsewhere.

   The 10-gigahertz bandwidth of the 8-micron fiber is so great that
even high-quality video could not fill it, said Andy Lawrence, director
of project analysis at Cambridge consultancy Improcom Ltd., which helped
design GBN. It has been installed in anticipation of applications several
years away.

`ASKING FOR THE MOON'

   In the short term the GBN could be used to carry satellite TV signals
received by the audio-visual services department.

    Lawrence said that what the university wanted ``was a bit like asking
for the moon,'' since, in Hartley's words, it needed a ``low-tech,
low-risk, long-term'' infrastructure. The dark fiber itself is seen as low
technology; it is the networking technology running over it that is high
tech.

   To save money, the bulk of which will be spent simply on laying cable, the
university's network will share duct space with the Cambridge cable
TV company. However, regulations do not allow the two to share cables. As much
of the ducting as possible will run across university land.

   Hartley emphasized that Project Granta is different from such ventures as
Project Athena at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which aims to
develop computer systems themselves.

   Instead, Granta is an exercise in how to manage corporate information
systems. Its infrastructure will provide both general and specific
applications, from electronic mail to communications for advanced molecular
biology.

Stanford To Join Med Net

    Stanford University, of Palo Alto, California, has signaled its intention
to participate in a medical school network that will link a group of
universities using the ISDN primary rate interface. Stanford joins Duke
University, Johns Hopkins Health Systems and Harvard University, which have
been negotiating with a number of long distance companies to use ISDN to link
the medical schools of each campus.

   The North American primary rate interface specifies 23 bearer channels and
one signaling channel, all operating at 64 kilobits per second. It provides
bandwidth equivalent to the T1 speed of 1.544 megabits per second, giving the
institutions the flexibility to transmit data, image and video. Image
transmission appears to have the most potent application in the med school
network.

   ``There's a great need internally and externally for each institution
to move radiographic images back and forth'' between offices and storage,
said Norman Sefton, assistant business manager and director of
communications at Duke, in Durham, North Carolina.

   Managing the X-ray database is a tremendous physical problem, Sefton
said. ``It would be nice if we could handle them like a jukebox-just call
them up and share the stored image for consultations or other uses,'' he
said.

First Union Banks On VSATs

    First Union Corp. has replaced its leased-line network with a
multimillion-dollar Ku-band satellite network that the bank expects
will help it save $4 million in communications costs over the next five
years.

   The very small aperture terminal network includes 646 earth stations that
link 723 bank sites.

   The company, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has bank branches and
business offices in 36 U.S. states. The network will carry all the
bank's data communications traffic, including that generated by its
automated teller machines. First Union also runs its network security alarms
on the VSAT network.

   The bank's voice traffic will remain on virtual-network
circuits provided by US Sprint Communications Co. and AT&T, said
George Mattingly, vice president and director of telecommunications at First
Union.

Forecast Calls For Ethernet

    The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, in Reading,
England, is to install a high-capacity Ethernet local area network later
this year to increase the accurancy of its daily forecasts.

   The organization produces weather reports for 18 European countries, using
a numerical model of the atmosphere.

   The new local area network, to be supplied by Untra Network Technologies,
of San Jose, California, will add to the ECMWF's existing Cray
Research Inc. supercomputer and its IBM 3090 mainframe. The organization said
it needs 1-gigabit-per-second data traffic capacity to match
data files of gigabyte size with giga-flop processor performance in a
distributed environment.

Developer Lures Business With Fiber

    By DAWN BUSHAUS

         DAKOTA DUNES, SOUTH DAKOTA-A real estate developer is counting
on a fiber optic communications network, coupled with a buyers'
market and a scenic environment, to lure communications-intensive
businesses to the self-contained city it is developing in Dakota
Dunes.

   Many developers and telephone companies across the United States are
experimenting with deploying fiber to businesses and homes. Dozens of
fiber-to-the-home and fiber-to-the-curb trials are under way, and
businesses are beginning to demand services, such as videoconferencing and
high-speed data transmission, that are delivered best over the medium.

   Dakota Dunes Development Co., a division of Midwest Capital Group Inc., of
Sioux City, Iowa, is developing this 2,000-acre community at the
convergence of the Big Sioux and Missouri rivers, near Sioux City. It will
feature 1,600 residential units, a 216-acre business park, an
18-hole golf course and a $1.8 million fiber network.

   The Dakota Dunes project, which originated two years ago, is expected to
take 15 years to complete. The developer is targeting credit card, insurance,
computer and other communications-intensive companies as potential new
businesses for the community, said Glenn Ivarsen, manager of economic
development at Dakota Dunes Development. About 5,000 jobs can be created in
the business complex, he said.

   U S West Inc., of Englewood, Colorado, soon will begin deploying the fiber
optic network that will provide telecommunications service to the businesses
and residences in Dakota Dunes.

FIBER IN EVERY BUILDING

   ``We will be bringing fiber to every corporate hub site in each
new building, and we will also be bringing fiber to the curb for the
residences,'' said Don Faber, service manager for large
business services at U S West. ``We'll be letting bids
soon because we have to have fiber in to serve the first business
customer.''

   That first customer, Financial Reserve Corp., an East Haven,
Connecticut-based credit card company that targets college markets, is
expected to set up shop early next year.

   Keith Eaton, vice president of management information systems at Financial
Reserve, said the fiber network, along with the tax breaks offered in South
Dakota, played a role in the company's decision to locate an office
in Dakota Dunes.

   The site will support customer-service and collection operations,
which will require heavy use of both voice and data communications, Eaton
said. The company has not yet signed up for any specific telecoms services,
however.

   U S West's Faber said he expects business customers to use the
fiber network for high-speed data services, such as integrated services
digital networks, and for videoconferencing.

   For residential customers, the company initially will offer only plain old
telephone service, he said. Services such as remote meter-reading or
security monitoring may be offered to residential customers in the
future.

Developing World Looks To OSI

    By DAVID ROCKS

         NEW YORK-Though behind in the drive for Open Systems
Interconnection, developing countries face fewer barriers to adopting the
protocols than their industrialized counterparts, some experts say.

   Nearly 20 years after users first began clamoring for interoperability,
products following OSI protocols are finally becoming widely
available-but not so much in the developing world.

   ``OSI products will come, but how soon, we will see,'' said S.
Ramakrishnam of India's Department of Electronics. ``It is important that
we build up momentum with significant involvement by industry and users.''

   Still, once they get around to adopting open systems, developing countries
may face fewer barriers than developed countries, according to Ramakrishnam
and others.

   There may be more resistance to change in Europe, Japan and the United
States, where businesses already have a substantial investment in systems,
than in developing countries, which generally do not have an installed
proprietary base, said Kathy Dally, an OSI consultant with Omnicom Inc., of
Vienna, Virginia.

   Developing countries ``don't have extensive networks,'' Dally said.
``So instead of buying proprietary operations, they would be more likely
to buy the OSI solution.''

CREATING BELIEVERS

   Ramakrishnam said no vendors in his country sell OSI products, although one
of the 11 computer networks in India plans to use OSI protocols.

   The system, called Ernet, is a national network using very small aperture
terminals to link universities and researchers nationwide. Funded by the
United Nations Development Program, one goal of the project was to spur
development of OSI standards in India.

   ``We want to clarify the environment to make it easier for people
to become believers,'' Ramakrishnam said.

    Lincoln Faurer, president of the Corporation for Open Systems
International, a not-for-profit group based in McLean, Virginia,
that advocates OSI solutions, said developing countries-indeed all
countries-could gain more in terms of open systems if they were to put
aside nationalistic goals in favor of internationalism.

   ``Every country wants to spend the money at home to solve the problem
[of interoperability], but they don't have the money to really put a dent
in it,'' Faurer said. Instead of trying to develop indigenous standards,
he said, nations should work with international agencies for a global
solution.

   Such a global solution is a key concern of developing countries,
Ramakrishnam said. With different regions developing their own conception
of OSI, countries that are not part of one region must make a decision
about which regional standard to adopt.

   ``We have to choose between the United States, Japan and Europe,
and we don't like it, so harmonization is very important to
us,'' he said.

   Ironically, because of the untested nature of OSI, if developing countries
lag in its adoption, they might actually come out ahead, said John McConnell,
a networking consultant based in Boulder, Colorado.

   ``Whether OSI is going to work or ever be a commercial success is
something that we won't know for another several
years,'' he said.

Unisys Unveils Open Architecture

    By KELLY JACKSON

         NEW YORK-Unisys Corp. has unveiled a computer architecture for
building distributed networks out of its own and other
manufacturers' products.

   Unisys, of Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, assembled its top executives in New
York earlier this month to announce its long-awaited blueprint for
building enterprise networks (CommunicationsWeek International, 17
September).

   The Unisys Architecture unifies the computer manufacturer's
divergent product families and melds them with other vendors'
products using international and de facto networking standards.

   Users and industry analysts hailed the new direction as a milestone.

   ``Unisys' architecture is a real solution. It's tangible and it's going
to prove to be the best option'' for many users, said Dean Sutton,
president of CUBE Inc., of Detroit, a Unisys user group.

   The Unisys Architecture, which includes the spectrum of technologies needed
to construct a multivendor network, also addresses network management. Unisys
officials offered clues to the company's plans for that area.

   James Murtaugh, vice president and general manager at the
company's Information Networking Group, said Unisys has decided to
add Simple Network Management Protocol network management technology to its
future management software under the Unisys Architecture umbrella.

   Next year the company will unveil its software based on the OSI Common
Management Information Protocol, using OSI/Network Management Forum
specifications, he said.

   Unisys officials said the company's architecture emphasizes
standards, not proprietary networking protocols and operating systems.

   While IBM's Systems Application Architecture and Digital
Equipment Corp.'s Network Application Support rely on proprietary
systems as the core architecture, the Unisys architecture provides a clear
migration path from proprietary to open systems, analysts said.

FINANCIAL WOES

   Officials unveiled the architecture about a week after Unisys announced
it would eliminate its 25-cent-per-share dividend-news that sent the
company's stock price plummeting.

   James Unruh, Unisys president and chief executive officer, said the company
will likely show a loss in the third quarter, but return to profitability in
the fourth.

   For the full year, however, Unruh was less sanguine about whether Unisys
will post a profit. He said the volatility of the economy, worsened by the
tenuous situation in the Middle East, makes it impossible to forecast earnings
with any degree of accuracy.

   Financial analysts were wondering if the new architecture would be enough
to offset damage caused by the discontinuation of the company's
dividend.

   Charles Rothchild, an analyst with Pershing & Co., in New York,
said Wall Street greeted the elimination of the dividend with ``a
great deal of disappointment.''

   ``This is a company that has paid a dividend for 95 years,'' he noted.
One day after the 27 September announcement to eliminate dividend payment,
Unisys stock tumbled some 23 percent, to $5.375 per share.

   Candee Wilde contributed to this story.

Novell Offers AS/400 Link

    By Kella Knack

         PROVO, UTAH-Novell Inc. has introduced a token-ring connectivity
option for NetWare, its local area network operating system, that expands
support for IBM Application System/400 midrange computers on NetWare LANs.

   Novell is the first third-party vendor to offer a token-ring
option for IBM equipment. It is being provided in Version 1.3 of NetWare SNA
Gateway Server software and Version 1.2 of NetWare 3270 LAN Workstation client
software.

   Numerous users have asked Novell for connectivity options over the past two
years, said Gerry Machi, director of product marketing at Novell. According to
Bruce Robertson, with Interconnect Network Consulting Group, of Santa Monica,
California, ``people assumed if they had IBM they could not use
Novell.''

   The SNA gateway software turns an IBM Personal System/2 PC into a Systems
Network Architecture gateway server, letting users on a NetWare LAN share a
token-ring link with an IBM 2/3X or AS/400 host. It costs $2,995.
The NetWare 3270 LAN software gives 64 LAN workstations access to up to 64
concurrent terminal/printer sessions on an AS/400. It costs $995.

         LONDON-Videoconferencing is becoming a more viable business
tool with developing international standards, breakthroughs in microchip
technology and the prospect of falling prices.

   Companies have used videoconferencing primarily for internal meetings.
Products hit the market in the mid-1980s, and there are now about 2,000
corporate studios worldwide, mostly in the United States.

   Norman Gaut, president of videoconference equipment manufacturer PictureTel
Corp., of Peabody, Massachusetts, said the industry has been U.S.-based
mainly because of the comparative price and quality of public networks
elsewhere. But network improvements, including the more widespread
availability of international ISDN, will make the market more global, he
said.

   Trans-Atlantic videoconferences cost several hundred dollars an hour.
They are not even possible between many countries because of a lack of
international public circuit-switched
64-kilobit-per-second services.

   Market growth has also been impeded by a lack of equipment standards, the
high cost of equipment and the large amount of bandwidth required to use
it.

   The transmission of broadcast-quality, full-motion television
pictures in digital form requires bandwidth of about 5.5 megahertz for
transmission speeds of between 90 megabits per second and 100 mbps. But
ordinary public telephone networks are designed to carry relatively
low-quality voice signals, which need only 10 kilobits per second, or a
bandwidth of 3.5 MHz. Therefore, video transmission requires compression.

   Video signals are also analog, which means they must be converted to be
transmitted over digital leased phone lines. The process of converting and
then compressing pictures is carried out by computers called
coder-decoders, or codecs.

   Codecs compress signals to as low as 64 kbps and to the T1 and E1 speeds of
1.544 mbps and 2.048 mbps. As a rule, the greater the bandwidth, the better
the picture quality. But more bandwidth also costs the end user more
money.

   George Newman, an analyst at International Data Corp., in Framingham,
Massachusetts, expects an increasing number of products to operate at around
384 kbps as a compromise between price and quality.

STANDARDS MEAN ACCEPTANCE

   Meanwhile, equipment manufacturers and users alike say standards will help
further the acceptance of products. Current systems are proprietary,
preventing users of one product from communicating with those of another.

   The first step toward standardization should take place in November, when
the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee is due to
ratify the H.261 video compression standard. GEC Plessey Telecommunications
Ltd. and Video Telecom Corp. say they already have compliant products; other
suppliers, such as PictureTel, Harris Video Communication Systems Inc. and
Compression Labs Inc., plan to make their products compliant next year.

   Standards will be applied only in part. H.261 is the video compression
element of a broader Px64 standard, which recommends speech compression for
video transmission at 64 kbps.

   Using so much bandwidth for voice is a waste of bandwidth, and also impairs
video quality. Consequently, many products will compress speech to 16 kbps,
while adhering to the CCITT's video-compression standard.

   Suppliers ultimately want videoconferencing products to be as convenient as
using a simple telephone. Widespread ISDN, which provides dial-up
64-kbps speeds, would facilitate such connectivity, and allow users to
make a video call for the price of a normal phone call.

VIDEOCONFERENCING OVER PC

   Some observers say videoconferencing over personal computers will one day
supplant the need for expensive codecs. Instead of needing special screens and
cameras, conferencing could take place in a PC built with videoconferencing
chips, and a miniature camera mounted on top.

   In August, PictureTel and chip maker Intel Corp. began developing
microprocessors-which will be available to any PC manufacturer-to
allow videoconferencing at the desktop.

   Harris Corp. formed Harris Video Communications in July and rolled out its
PC-based Anamix Personal Communications system, which links to eight
people in different locations. Users are able to simultaneously watch
full-motion images, listen to conversation and share graphics. The APC
costs $85,000 for three units and $200,000 for eight.

   With the system, users need a PC, which can also be supplied by the
company, a camera mounted on the PC, and a microphone/speaker attachment. It
compresses to rates between 64 kbps and 1.544 mbps.

   PictureTel's Gaut said before high-quality PC videoconferencing becomes
a reality, a new generation of chips must be developed. Intel is working
on a chip capable of one billion operations per second, compared to 40
million per second possible with current chips, he said.

   IDC's Newman predicts a mass market for multimedia PCs, carrying
data, graphics, video and speech within five years. The market, he said, will
be spurred by increased PC memory capacity and the availability of more
bandwidth, brought about by extensive deployment of optical fiber in the
public network.

   Video Telecom, of Austin, Texas, claims to have the only videoconferencing
product that already carries graphics and data. Its Conference System, which
costs about $45,000 per user, operates at between 112 kbps and 768 kbps
and can retrieve data from an on-board hard disk so that photographs,
slides and documents can be used as part of a videoconference. VTC supplies
two monitors, one for video, and the other for data, and a tablet that allows
notes or changes to be made to a graphic, seen in real time on the other end
of the videoconference.

   Not all potential users are sold on the concept of videoconferencing over
PCs. Deborah Scholl, assistant vice president of financial services company
First Chicago Corp., maintains that PC screens are too small for large
business meetings.

CUTS TRAVEL EXPENSES

    First Chicago has been using videoconferencing for a year between offices
in Chicago, New York and London. Scholl said the company's 57
conferences have saved it more than $17,500 in travel expenses over the
last five months.

   First Chicago's conferences are transmitted over the public
network at 112 kbps. PictureTel equipment accesses two 56-kbps circuits.
Though most meetings are for internal business or training, the company has
regular conferences with one of its West Coast clients.

   Scholl hopes public operators will offer bridging facilities to allow three
meetings to be linked, currently not possible with its PictureTel equipment.
Conferences involving three or more rooms are possible, but the equipment is
more expensive.

   Many telecoms operators already offer public booths. British Telecom, for
instance, has 11 public videoconferencing centers across the United
Kingdom.

   PictureTel's U.K. distributor held the first videoconference
between the United Kingdom and Australia last month. The video ISDN link was
carried by OTC Ltd., which has just begun international ISDN service to the
United Kingdom.

   Most European telephone operators offer videoconferencing. The first to
offer switched international video services was BT, in conjunction with
Teleglobe Canada Inc. in 1984. BT now offers such services to 17 countries,
and estimates that about 200 U.K. companies use videoconferencing on private
networks.

   Videoconferencing is attracting more attention despite high entry costs for
suppliers, particularly for research. Six year-old PictureTel, for
instance, is a leader in low-bit rate systems but is still unprofitable.
Before long, users will be able to choose from an increasing number of less
expensive products.

   What is unclear, however, is exactly how users will apply video
conferencing-whether with conventional codec-based products or a new
generation of multi-media PCs.

IBM's European Mouthpiece

    By ANNE-MARIE ROUSSEL

         Corporate lobbying of European Commission representatives was an
activity limited to a handful of players only a few years ago-and, at
that time, IBM's Olivier de la Fouchardiere was already a member of
the club.

   Since then, the practice has widened. But because of cultural differences,
professional lobbying is still not as well received in Europe as it is in the
United States.

   ``Lobbying still has a negative connotation in Europe,'' la
Fouchardiere says. Whereas lobbyists are registered professionals in
Washington, they have a more nebulous status in Europe, where the
political clout of special-interest groups or corporations is not
appreciated.

   La Fouchardiere, however, combats the European attitude with bravado:
``I love being called a lobbyist, it's the fun part of my job,'' he says,
adding he likes to use the power behind Big Blue to help shape the course
of politics in Europe.

   ``Coming from IBM, I never had problems getting appointments with top
officials,'' he says. Such influence seems particularly useful, now that
there are signs that the European ways are changing, he says. These days,
when he goes to Brussels to present IBM's viewpoint, ``there are several
hundred lobbyists representing interest groups or corporations waiting to
see officials, where there was no one before.''

   La Fouchardiere has a long history of representing IBM-in various
capacities. After joining the computer manufacturer 25 years ago, the
50-year-old engineer alternated for years between the
company's French subsidiary and IBM Europe, both based in Paris.

   Since last year he has overseen IBM France's standards programs
and its external relations.

   In the standards area, la Fouchardiere directs IBM's research and
development team, located in the southern French town of La Gaude, which works
with such bodies as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
(ETSI) to develop Europe-wide telecommunications products.

   As director of external relations, he oversees IBM France's
relationship with the French government and the European Community. He
keeps abreast of laws or directives that may affect IBM's business in the
region, and tries to influence the law-making process by lobbying the
right people.

   His current crusade is with the French regulatory body, the Direction a la
Reglementation Generale. The DRG has prepared a draft legislation-to be
debated by the French Parliament this month-to reform the telecoms market
in France (CommunicationsWeek International, 17 September).

   As a potential supplier to possible service providers, IBM would prefer the
market to be as wide-open as possible, la Fouchardiere says.

    But as he sees it, the DRG's proposal needs more work, so he
would like Parliament to amend it.

   ``It's too complicated,'' he says. ``It creates categories of services
that don't exist.''

   These categories, identified in the proposal as ``support services,''
include certain data communication services, such as those offered by
packet-switched network Transpac or the integrated services digital
network. These data services are grouped by the licensing procedure they
require-an arbitrary process, said la Fouchardiere.

   ``There is no objective determination of where the category starts or
ends,'' he says, ``so potential service providers can't know whether they
are within the limits or not.''

   In addition, private datacom operators-which he says should
theoretically compete on equal footing with France Telecom-are actually
not considered on par with the national operator. While the law clearly
defines what private operators can or cannot do, there is no such definition
for France Telecom, giving the impression that France Telecom faces no
restrictions.

   ``If I were a private operator, I would very much like to know what
France Telecom can do to gobble me up,'' la Fouchardiere says. ``If France
Telecom wants to be a competitive market, then it should be submitted to
the same rules as anybody else.''

   Another shortfall of the DRG's law proposal, he argues, is there
is no provision for service providers to be included in the
decision-making process.

-    If la Fouchardiere could achieve one goal in Europe, it would be
this: that pan-European voice and data communications networks
would no longer be subject to geographical barriers.

   ``National frontiers get in my way,'' he says.

IN THE NEWS

    By Malcolm Laws

         3Com Corp. has named Richard Joyce, former managing director of its
U.K. subsidiary, as the company's first European president of 3Com
Europe.

   Effective last week, the new job means the 34-year-old Joyce will
work from the Paris headquarters of 3Com Europe. The first day in his new role
was spent at a networking exhibition in the Soviet Union.

   Joyce, who helped set up the U.K. arm of Bridge Communications Inc. before
it merged with 3Com in 1987, takes over from senior international vice
president John Marman.

   Marman has returned to 3Com corporate headquarters in Santa Clara,
California, after a year spent overseeing the shift in the company's
European organization.

   The European reshuffle got under way in 1989, when a group of 3Com's
General Europe Area management left to form their own company. Soon
afterward, responsibility for the smaller European territories, Africa and
parts of the Middle East-all previously in GEA-passed to the two major
subsidiaries, the United Kingdom and France.

   The non-European countries now come under 3Com Intercontinental and
the smaller European territories have become independent.

   Joyce says one of his next tasks is to open Eastern Europe to
3Com's networking products, hence the early Soviet visit. Tom
Plymouth, recently hired from Digital Equipment Corp., will become the new
U.K. managing director.

International Users Take Command

    By David Gillick And Denis Gilhooly

         Europe's telecommunications administrations remain
oblivious to the fundamental needs of national and international
telecommunications users.

      Inadequate standards, low quality of service, over-regulation,
limited product offerings, inadequate network management, and poor customer
relations are stifling business development across industry sectors, according
to the 1990 CommunicationsWeek International/PA Consulting Group International
User Survey.

   But evidence is mounting that the balance of power is finally shifting in
favor of the customer.

   Not surprisingly, the survey finds that users want basic, reliable and
affordable services at competitive prices. What is surprising, however, is
that, increasingly, users regard electronic information exchange-and the
effective inter-networking to allow the exchange to occur-vital to
many of their operations.

   They expect the basics, but they want more.

   Users can no longer afford to be held captive by monopolies reinforced by
outmoded regulatory regimes. To be competitive in a global marketplace their
needs must come first. Otherwise, like users in the United States 10 years
ago, those in Europe will seek alternatives.

   Telecommunications is now the central nervous system of a
service-based global economy based increasingly on the exchange of
electronic information. Electronic information exchange is the commodity that
will fuel economic growth into the 21st century.

INCREASING CHOICE

   Today, the spread of competition in Europe's most liberalized
markets has resulted in increasing choice in equipment and service offerings.
This new-found freedom is leading users to articulate their needs and
shape the development of a free marketplace.

   The lumbering telecoms administrations, slow to wake to the realities of
the marketplace, are responding in piecemeal fashion. Offerings such as
one-stop shopping are emerging.

   But these are not enough.

   The regulatory impediments against pan-European networking and tariffs
that are too high are forcing users to implement alternative solutions.

   One such alternative is very small aperture terminal (VSAT)
satellite operations which are a proven means of bypassing the fixed-link
network. Others may be emerging mobile radio services or even competitive
fixed networks.

ASTONISHING CHANGES

   Since the 1989 International User Survey, astonishing changes have been
witnessed. The Iron Curtain has collapsed: Germany has united; new
European institutions are emerging and old ones are forced to change;
monopolies, cartels and trade barriers are crumbling; competition and foreign
investment are being welcomed, not resisted; privatization of public holdings
is more commonplace; new international agreements, regulatory liberalization
and competition are exerting a forceful downward pressure on tariffs.

   In short, there is no turning back.

   These changes have helped users assume control of their own destiny. No
longer will they accept having to adapt to the dictates of monopoly service
providers. Now it is the suppliers who must learn to adapt. They must offer
real choice in their product and service offerings at internationally
competitive prices.

   The 1990 Survey confirms that telecoms has finally entered the boardroom.
An overwhelming number of telecoms managers now report to board members or
information technology directors.

   Users don't believe they are getting value for their money. With
the exception of facsimile, the vast majority of respondents rated telecoms
administration services as mediocre, on a scale of 1 to 5.

   For international communications, users' catalog of complaints
range from the lack of international standards to the fact that their needs
were being misunderstood.

IMPLICATIONS UNKNOWN

   However, while users recognize the potentially devastating effects of
network failure, in almost all cases the survey shows the cost of network
failure has not been calculated by users. Consequently, the full implications
are not known.

   At the grassroots level, and despite the European Commission's
terminal equipment directive, users in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium,
Spain and Germany remain concerned that regulatory restrictions on modem usage
are inhibiting their business.

   Increasingly, regulation covering mobile radio and satellite terminal
equipment is becoming a key concern.

   In terms of regulatory controls on service offerings, the biggest area of
concern among users is in the interconnection of private networks to the
public switched telephone network, an issue that is pointedly not addressed by
the Commission's framework for Open Network Provision across
Europe.

   This is closely followed by a desire to see a relaxation in the rules
governing the resale of spare capacity and satellite usage. Rules governing
cable television, mobile radio and electronic mail form a second tier of
concern.

   From the perspective of the service provider, the three areas that stand
out as being most affected by competition are mobile radio, leased circuits,
and packet switched data communications.

   In the burgeoning field of mobile communications, while almost 25 percent
of users are represented by high-level management, the survey found that
up to 30 percent of users of mobile communications are now employed in direct
sales. Cost remains the crucial issue in the uptake of mobile technology.

   Significantly, the survey revealed a decidedly low demand for international
roaming capability as embodied in the forthcoming pan-European digital
cellular radio network.

 TARIFFS MUST FALL

   Overall, though deregulation bodes well for a reduction in telecoms costs
it may be bad news for telecoms managers.

   The survey indicates an average salary level throughout Western Europe of
$40,000 a year. Switzerland again tops the salary poll, followed
closely by Spain and France-evidence perhaps that telecoms managers in
countries with a traditionally strong monopoly regime stand to gain the
most.

   In future, mobility and the ability to acquire new skills will be crucial
in the post-1992 deregulated market.
    The unmistakable message of the 1990 international user survey is that
telecoms tariffs must fall, and they must fall soon.

   More than 70 percent of respondents believe the move toward cost-based
pricing would have a major impact on their businesses. For voice, the
overwhelming demand is for cheaper international and long-distance calls.
For data, this criteria is matched only by the demand for lower usage
charges.

   For leased circuits, cheaper international and long distance charges is
matched only by demand for lower fixed costs. And for satellites, the general
desire is for cheaper tariffs and lower fixed costs.

   With a mounting downward pressure on international and long-distance
tariffs, what will determine the balance of power between the public telecoms
operators and users?

   And will that balance favor the use of public or private network
solutions?

   Clearly, the public/private network tradeoff for users will depend on that
user's volume of traffic and the concentration of traffic by route.
Increasingly, however, choice will be determined by the price of leased
circuits, in particular, relative to the public network and also by the value
assigned by the user to proprietary control, security, reliability,
availability, and response time.

   With tariffs falling, and leased circuits an increasingly attractive
option, the battlefield for the coming few years is therefore likely to be
over a relaxation of regulatory controls both on VSAT networks and for
private-to-public network interconnection.

How This Users Survey Was Conducted

    To compile the information for this study, CommunicationsWeek
International and PA Consulting Group sent out more than 5,700 questionnaires.
We received 317 responses, a healthy response rate of about 5 percent, upon
which we based our stories.

   Participants were asked to react to a series of questions by assigning
a numerical value from one to five, with one representing `not important'
and five representing `very important.'

   Marks in the range of two to four were most common, while extremes were
rare. In some cases, however, extreme marks came in waves as the
respondent unleashed a long line of `ones' for poor service or `fives' for
the desirability of cheaper tariffs and competition.

   The result, generally, is that users' desires appeared in shades of
grey.

   What we have tried to do is give meaning to those shades.

HOW IT BREAKS DOWN

   Generally, respondents used the questionnaire to comment on the things they
felt most strongly about-in some cases leaving other questions
unanswered. There is a striking consistency from country to country in the
completion rate for each major section in the questionnaire.

   Completion patterns fell into three broad categories:

   o People who tried to answer everything, failing only to evaluate those
services unavailable to them;

   o People who only answered the section which interested them
most-international telecommunications, security, encouragement of mobile
services and public service tariffing;

   o People who answered the minimum number of questions.

   The typical completion rates for the various survey sections were as
follows:

   o Management structure-60 percent;

   o Telecoms administration service/quality-10-45 percent;

   o International telecommunications-80 percent;

   o Security-90 percent;

   o Mobile services-55 percent;

   o Impact of national regulation-50 percent;

   o Telecoms administration concerns (telecoms administrations
only)-10 percent;

   o Impact of tariffs-55 percent;

   o Other factors-70 percent.

   THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE SURVEY

   Working closely with the CommunicationsWeek International staff on this
project was PA Consulting Group, a leading international management and
technology consultancy based in London and with offices in 20 countries.

    As was the case with last year's survey, London-based John
Buckley, director, telecommunications, lead the PA team.

   The writers and researchers were David Gillick, manager, policy and
regulations, computers and telecommunications; Garry Garrard, manager, mobile
communications; Peter Jenner, business manager, security consultancy centre;
Michele Williamson, consultant, human resources; Michel Bensimhon, manager,

International Telecoms Needs -- Are Europe's
Users Ready To Go Global?

    By John Buckley

         Telecoms administrations and suppliers have a long way to go before
meeting European users' needs.

   Despite their efforts to improve their services, and despite the attempts
by international bodies to re-shape the regulatory and competitive
environment in Europe, the results of this year's survey by PA
Consulting Group, of London, and CommunicationsWeek International, like last
year's, show that users aren't feeling enough of an
impact.

   With high international tariffs also becoming a greater concern this year,
European users may find themselves losing out to competitors from other parts
of the world, particularly North America, where telecoms regulations are
flexible and the market is more competitive.

   PICKING UP THE PACE

      In the last 12 months, the member states of the European Community have
picked up the pace of establishing a truly pan-European market for
general goods and services.

   Not only are they completing preparations for the planned 1992 launch of
their internal market; they are also taking wider steps toward opening
cross-border trade with Eastern Europe.

   These moves, plus other developments in world trade, are extending the
horizons of European trading companies; many that had been content doing
strictly domestic business are now thinking of marketing on a global
basis.

   Not surprisingly, therefore, Europe's business community is finding
international telecommunications more and more important. After all, a
company's ability to communicate efficiently with customers, distributors
or subsidiaries in other countries can be crucial to its market
penetration, particularly in countries where it competes with local-based
companies enjoying shorter lines of communication.

   But are the international telecoms needs of these growing companies being
met?

   If not, what problems are they experiencing?

LACK OF STANDARDS CITED

   The 1990 survey shows that, despite the considerable efforts of
international bodies to develop common standards, European users consider the
lack of unifying standards to be the single largest obstacle to international
communications.  This was also the finding in last year's survey,
suggesting that whatever the progress on international standards, the impact
is not strong enough or fast enough for users.

   Close behind the complaints about standards comes criticism of the service
limitations of the telecoms administrations, with users in Spain and Poland
being the most critical, but with all European countries expressing
concern.

   Closely allied with this concern are complaints against regulatory
restrictions; feelings of users about telecoms administrations service
limitations and regulatory restrictions seem to be running stronger this year
than in last year's survey. This level of concern is due largely to
the fact that telecoms providers and regulators often do not keep pace with
accelerating advances in technology, thus competition from potential new
market entrants is often stifled.

    But it is also clear that users are becoming much better informed about
telecoms developments; they are increasingly aware of what is technologically
feasible and what is available in certain other countries, for instance in the
United States, but which may be denied to them through regulatory constraints
in their own country.

   An example is satellite communications, where European users have come up
against the inflexibility of certain administrations and other service
providers; whereas in North America similar problems can be solved by the
flexibility of two-way satellite services allowed under the very small
aperture terminal (VSAT) arrangements.

   Because of these types of difficulties, plus the globalization of their own
businesses, users feel a strong need for suppliers to offer serviceson a
global basis.

   Eastern European countries, of course, have a major task ahead of them
before they can offer good quality communications, either within their
countries or internationally, and already there is a great deal of activity on
this score in many of the countries concerned.

   The responses to the survey show that when European users were asked about
the quality of international communications, those in Eastern Europe tended to
be the most critical (though those in Yugoslavia were among the most
satisfied).

    Interestingly, the countries most dissatisfied with their international
telecoms also included Luxembourg, France, Finland and Switzerland.

   But whether in Eastern or Western Europe, the level of tariffs charged for
international telecoms is recognized as a major issue.

   When asked in the survey which kind of tariff reductions would affect the
way they used public telecoms services, users cited high international call
charges for both data and voice.

   With the changing face of Europe and the globalization of markets, the
European users' need for effective international telecommunications
is becoming increasingly crucial.

   And telecoms authorities have shown that they can bring change about
quickly when they really want to-for instance, in West and East Germany,
where administrations are working to integrate their services.

   As pressure mounts in Europe for improving the level of international
telecommunications, users clearly wish to see administrations, government
bodies and others bring these changes about quickly.

Price The Missing Element In Europe's Mobile
Market

    By Garry Garrard

         Although mobile communications service providers plan to offer an
increasingly wide range of new services and facilities in Europe in the next
two years, users say they would prefer lower prices.

   In fact, users in nearly every country surveyed by PA Consulting Group, of
London, and CommunicationsWeek International rate the prospect of lower
cellular costs more favorably than the industry's plans to introduce
GSM, PCN, Telepoint and DECT technologies.

   Lower equipment costs also outpolled such concerns as extended national
coverage, service quality, and provision of international roaming, data
services and smaller phone size.

   Cost was particularly an issue in the Benelux countries, Germany, Italy and
Spain, where competition and choice are limited and where prices are far
higher than the European average. But price was also a concern in Scandinavia,
where the mobile phone market has been liberalized for years.

   Only in the United Kingdom was equipment price not considered important,
but mobile phone equipment is often given away there, or sold at highly
discounted prices. U.K. users almost unanimously called for lower call
charges-even more so than German users, who pay more. This reflects high
penetration in the United Kingdom and the growing proportion of telecoms
budgets spent on mobile communications as usage seeps down to lower levels of
the company hierarchy.

ROOM FOR GROWTH

   There are more than three million cellular phone users in Europe, where the
market has grown nearly 60 percent in the past year, indicating buoyancy. But
clearly there is still room for growth in Europe's cellular market.
Will demand be spurred by the new services and improved facilities planned for
next year?

   These developments include GSM, a digital cellular service that will offer
integrated services digital network compatibility and international roaming;
personal communications networks, which will start in the United Kingdom in
1992, offering users new services, including some taking advantage of
smart-card technology; Telepoint, which is being adopted in many
countries using CT2 technology, and DECT, a new European standard for cordless
telephones which is currently in development.

   If the new technologies are to be successful, then use of mobile
communications must become more common. More than a third of the organizations
surveyed provide mobile phones only to senior management.

   Outside the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, most companies still regard a
cellular phone as a privilege or a status symbol, instead of a tool to
increase business efficiency or improve customer service. This attitude was
prevalent in the United Kingdom for some time after cellular was introduced,
but has now changed considerably.

EXTENDED COVERAGE

   A similar effect can be expected in other countries where penetration is
low, and there is limited awareness of the real benefits of mobile phones.

   Cellular networks usually start in major cities, with less populated areas
brought along gradually. The survey reflects the desire for national networks
to offer extended coverage, with users clearly refusing to accept
limitations.

   According to the survey, extending coverage was the top priority in France
and Italy, and an important issue in Spain. Even in Norway and Finland, where
population coverage is high, improvements would be welcomed, presumably in the
large, sparsely populated regions to the north.

   The speed of rollout of GSM coverage is specified in a memorandum of
understanding signed by all the European cellular operators. However, the
minimum requirements are modest compared even to that of current analog
services in France, Italy and Spain. It seems unlikely the GSM will be able to
compete seriously in the market unless the operators exceed their rollout
commitments considerably.

SERVICE QUALITY

   Service quality is another factor affecting basic mobile telephony that is
important to users, who find it frustrating when calls drop out or channels
aren't available when needed. Because U.K. cellular networks have
been heavily criticized for failing to provide adequate service, it was no
surprise to find that this is still an issue for U.K. users, even though
Cellnet, at least, has been publicizing that it is improving its
infrastructure.

   The strongest implied criticisms of service quality, however, come from
Sweden, where congestion in the Stockholm area can cause problems, as well as
Finland and Spain.

   The factors mentioned so far affect all basic telephony, but new features
or service upgrades were also investigated: International roaming, data
services and availability of smaller phones produced some unexpected
results.

   Conventional wisdom says demand for international roaming is small and
concentrated in the Benelux region. While the survey indeed shows a modest
requirement across Europe, only an average demand exists in Belgium and the
Netherlands. The strongest response came from Czechoslovakia, Poland and
Hungary!

   In Western Europe, Germany showed the highest level of interest, followed
by Portugal and Switzerland. Still, users rated roaming less significant than
price reductions.

   There is moderate interest in mobile data services everywhere, but
these receive low priority from most experienced users. Finland was the
only country with reasonable cellular penetration to highlight data as a
priority need. Other countries enthusiastic about data either had low
penetration (Spain, Italy and Portugal) or no service at all (Greece.)

   As cellular markets mature, and mobile telephones become widely accepted,
users recognize that most requirements are for simple telephony.

   The results of the survey have some clear messages for the success of GSM.
The pan-European digital cellular system has been developed with
comprehensive features.

COST TO USERS IMPORTANT

    Compatibility with ISDN, and the availability of international roaming,
are often quoted as the most significant features of the new system but
neither is likely to increase market growth to any great degree. Costs to
users will be far more important.

   It has been estimated that when the GSM system starts, infrastructure costs
will be 20 to 30 percent lower than for analog systems, and competition in
equipment supply can be expected to drive prices down even more as the system
matures.

    Operators will not be locked to a single manufacturer after they select
their initial supplier. If operators follow European Commission policy, and
relate tariffs directly to costs, users should gradually see the decrease in
network charges that they want, and the market will grow even faster.

   The complexity of GSM will make early phones large and expensive, compared
to analog versions. However, the survey showed that phone size was of little
concern, and in many countries GSM should have little problem competing with
analog mobiles-particularly in Germany, the largest potential market in
Europe.

   Reciprocal type approval, where a product approved for use in one country
will be accepted in other countries, allowing users to shop around, and volume
production will lead to rapid price reductions, and by 1993 or 1994, GSM
mobiles and hand-portables should be available throughout Europe at
reasonable prices.

   GSM has been seen as a triumph of technological cooperation. It is
undoubtedly true that great progress has been made, but it seems likely that
its real achievement will be political, by transferring the benefits of
competition and volume production to countries where it has been stoutly
resisted.

What Users Were Saying One Year Ago

    Users have found their voices.

   Increased competition throughout Europe, and the prospect of even further
liberalization, has empowered them-and with new and varied choices in
equipment and service offerings has come the leverage to make demands.

   This empowerment is clearly reflected in this year's
CommunicationsWeek International/PA Consulting Group survey.

   This year, users loudly articulated their needs-and their expectations
that these needs will be met.

   This is a change from last year, when survey respondents took a more
diffident approach, expressing their wishes from the position of the harried
professional left to contend with batches of problems foisted upon them by
manufacturers, telecoms administrators and even their own companies
(CommunicationsWeek International, 16 October, 1989).

   What follows is a summary of some of those wishes.

   o On spending:

   Users in all sectors surveyed foresaw greater outlays on communications,
with the service, transport and government sectors reporting an increase in
spending of more than 25 percent last year. In contrast, respondents from
finance companies expected to see only a 5 percent annual increase over
1988.

   Yet, even as overall spending was expected to rise, the proportion to be
spent on international communications was to grow, according to the survey.
Respondents predicted an average increase of 10 percent in international
communications spending between 1988 and 1989, with international
communications accounting for 35 percent of all spending in 1989.

   o On the telecommunications administrations:

   Users were generally content with the quality of service their telecoms
adminstrations provided. Switzerland, Finland and France were judged to have
the highest quality networks, while Italy was said to have the worst.

   Users did say they wanted standard international data network services with
quality network management and common tariffs-things that telecoms
administrations did not provide.

   o On facilities management:

   More than half of the telecoms professionals surveyed said they were likely
to adopt facilities management approaches for data communications by 1994.
There was also significant interest in outsourcing as a management tool for
voice networks.

   o On managed data network services:

   Last year's survey predicted that the importance of managed data
network service would grow 24 percent across Europe, with growth fastest in
the transport and manufacturing sectors in Norway, Sweden, Italy and the
United Kingdom.

   o On packet switching:

   The survey predicted that international public packet switching services
would become as important as international voice networks.

   o On public voice services:

   Public voice services were also expected to grow significantly in
importance while private voice networks remained at their 1989 levels of
importance.

   o On the integrated services digital network:

   Response to ISDN varied depending on where the question was asked. In the
United Kingdom, for instance, ISDN had lukewarm appeal, with only 46 percent
of the survey respondents saying they believe ISDN is critical to the
development of telecoms services and 46 percent saying it would be moderately
useful. In France, Belgium and West Germany, however, 70 percent of those
questioned saw ISDN as critical.

   o On electronic communications services:

   Respondents to last year's survey predicted that electronic
communications services would play an important role in their futures, with
public electronic mail, electronic data interchange and videoconferencing
rated as the fasted growing new technologies for international communications
users.

   o On open systems:

   Almost half of the users questioned last year predicted that Open Systems
Interconnection would oust IBM's proprietary SNA in the 1990s as the
most popular networking technology. Only 9 percent of the companies surveyed
felt that SNA would gain a dominant position.

   o On facsimile and telex technologies:

   Last year's survey showed that facsimile was as important to
companies as voice services, but demand was not expected to grow
significantly. As for telex, users predicted that it would soon become an
anachronism.

   o On barriers to international development:

   Lack of standards was deemed to be the single greatest barrier to
international development last year; this was closely followed by staff and
skill shortages, limitations of telecoms administration services, vendors not
understanding the needs of users, product limitations, regulatory
restrictions, inadequate network management and insufficient support for
business managers.

   o On human resources:

   Average salaries for telecoms staff in western Europe hovered around
$46,000; most managers in eastern European countries earned less than
$15,000 a year.

   Information systems managers were paid the least, averaging $39,000,
with network/operations managers earning only slightly more.

   The highest salary levels were found in the finance sector, with
respondents reporting an average of $53,000. Those in energy averaged
$46,000; transport, $45,000.

   Government salaries were said to be on a par with government, with averages
of $44,000.

   The biggest problem facing telecoms managers in private industry last year
was staff shortages. One-third of the respondents employed by governments
called staff shortages a major problem, while as many as 70 percent of the
respondents in other areas said there was a serious lack of workers.

   o Other points related by the human resources section of the 1989
survey include:

   Only one of every four managers reported to an information technology
director; telecoms managers were more likely to report to an operations
manager, administration manager or the finance department.

      Most telecoms professionals served more than 200 people, and about
$10,000 was spent each year on each person who uses telecoms
facilities.

Increasing User Anxiety Surrounds Data Security

    By By Peter Jenner

         With more and more businesses in Europe depending on third parties
to exchange information for them, data security is proving to be a significant
concern.

   This growing anxiety is reflected in results of the survey conducted by PA
Consulting Group, of London, and CommunicationsWeek International. Ninety
percent of the respondents answered the questions on security, easily the
highest response level for any of the subject areas the questionnaire covered.
(The next highest category was international telecommunications, with an
80 percent rate of response.)

    Probably the most significant outcome of the whole survey was the response
to the questions concerning availability. More than 80 percent of the
respondents admitted that they had no idea how much it would cost their
companies if their communications networks were to fail. Yet more than half of
those who had estimated the potential losses thought it would cost $1
million or more if the network collapsed.

   Such a result suggests that most managers still subscribe to the attitude
that ``it won't happen to me.''

   Confidentiality of information has always been the most prominent security
issue in the minds of managers and the survey confirms that this remains
so: Sixty-eight percent of the respondents said confidentiality was
their biggest headache.

CONFIDENTIALITY CRITICAL

   There are many cases where confidentiality is critical but an objective
analysis usually shows that they are in the minority. In most cases, an
objective assessment of risks to the business would clearly show that failure
to ensure the integrity of information, such as money transfers, or lack of
availability of data-for example, in process control-would cause
much more damage or direct losses than if someone were to feed at the
information.

   In other words, businesses are more worried about the hacker than they are
about maintaining and transmitting incorrect data.

    An example of the need for integrity in the finance sector was an
attempted 20 million fraud targeted at Mitsubishi International Finance
Corporation. The fraudsters tapped into EUCLID, the Eurobond information and
clearing service, using a home computer and modem and tried to divert funds to
a Swiss bank account. The attempt failed only because the staff at the bank
receiving the proceeds queried the transaction. A better-planned attempt
could have been more successful.

   One way of preventing this attempt would have been to check that the money
transfer request was valid, thus ensuring the integrity of the data.

   Concern over privacy has been growing over the past few years. Much of this
concern is directed towards the storage and processing of personal data in
computer systems.

GROWING CONCERN

   Each European country has a data protection law which, in spite of its
name, is intended to protect personal privacy and shield the public from what
is seen as an insidious threat, as vast banks of computer-held data
spread across the world. Such data might easily be incorrect or open to
abuse.

   The survey showed that companies in many sectors hear the message and are
giving the issue the attention it deserves.

   In the government, health and education sectors the most prominent concern
by far was confidentiality of personal and employment-record information.
But in some sectors-mostly retail and distribution-concern over
personal privacy was far lower, pointing to a lack of concern about
customers' information.

    Business managers do not seem to realize that data protection laws give
equal protection to the rights of the corporate individual as to the private
individual. Companies should recognize this deficiency and take care over who
holds information about them and their businesses.

   Conversely, despite the importance of confidentiality in the public
sectors, there was no recognition of the need to care about
customers' data, and in many cases no recognition of the existence
of customers.

NATURAL DISASTERS

   There are many stories of accidents and disasters that cripple
communications facilities and can cost millions. One of the more extreme was
the 17 October 1989 earthquake in San Francisco, which many businesses
survived without physical damage, but which made for very heavy financial
losses because their computers could not communicate with the outside world
long afterward.

    Less dramatically, many businesses realized how risky it is to depend on a
single supplier when British Telecom engineers went on strike in 1988.

   Another common cause of problems is bad capacity planning. An example of
this was the Companies Registration Office in the United Kingdom, which had 35
computing system breakdowns in seven months. Of these, two were due to loss of
power, two to operating system problems and 31 to network overload.

A Look At The Human Side Of Telecommunications

    By Michele Williamson

         Liberalization is not just about suppliers competing to provide the
best value equipment and services, it is also about jobs.

   As the market is freed across the continent, people, too, will compete for
better paying work with more status and improved working conditions.

   And as telecoms deregulation takes hold, and the European Community moves
toward economic unity, the job market will change. The post-1992 single
market will be as much about the freedom of movement of people as it will be
about goods and services.

    But Europe still consists of a patchwork of telecoms structures and
policies, from the centralized East to free-market West.

   And as such, the 1990 CommunicationsWeek International/PA Consulting Group
survey results confirm that there are vast differences in the perceived value,
importance and earnings of telecoms professionals from one country to the
next.

   Most telecoms departments are fairly small: Sixty-four percent
of survey respondents report fewer than 10 members and 81 percent are in
departments of fewer than 26. The vast majority-87 percent-report
directly to either an information technology director (45 percent)
or other board member (42 percent).

   Most of the 6 percent who belong to departments with 100 or more people,
work in the United Kingdom. That country, however, has more large companies
than most other Community states and this probably accounts for the
difference.

   Many senior telecoms managers and directors reached their position through
experience and not through formal education, starting their working careers as
juniors in telecoms or with the armed forces as radio operators, or with the
national telecoms administration.

   But this is changing. Formal training-in business as well as
technology-is becoming more important among the newer generation of
would-be managers. Developing more slowly, the world over, is higher
education in communications. Compared with the United States, which has
pioneered higher education in business and telecommunications, Europe can only
offer a handful of MBA-type courses.
    The survey found that the highest paid professionals are not found in the
most liberal regime, the United Kingdom, where the average telecoms
professional salary is under $40,000 a year, but in monopoly markets
such as France and, in particular, Switzerland, where the average salary is
more than $60,000. Switzerland, whose telecoms professionals are paid
three times as much as their Polish colleagues, also dominated last
year's salary league table.

COMPETITION PLAYS ROLE

   This, too, could well change as competition takes over. Although
competition is not the only factor that determines salary levels-pay
scales are consistently higher for all industry sectors in certain
countries-it could play a significant part in an open, mobile employment
market.

    Apart from differences in the telecoms markets themselves, the cost of
living varies enormously from one country to another, and there are different
national pay customs and cultural factors. In some countries, employees are
paid extra if they work outside normal business hours. Salaries vary not just
between countries but according to business sector.

   The tremendous salary range from one industry sector to another in the
United Kingdom, for instance, is clearly seen in the results of PA's
1990 Survey of Employment Trends in Telecoms. A network technician could earn
12,200 in the manufacturing sector, up to 17,300 in the financial industry; a
telecoms manager would make 25,600 in manufacturing and 31,000 in
finance.

   These variations reflect such factors as the employer's level of
investment in technology and the relative importance of telecoms in a
particular business.

THE CHALLENGE AHEAD

   Countries on the threshold of deregulation and new technology can
potentially reap the benefits of skills and solutions developed by the
pioneering countries. But countries that deregulate early face the prospect of
losing their valuable skills to these``developing'' countries.

   This is both a threat and an opportunity, and it will grow as 1992
approaches and as Eastern Europe opens up. For example, skilled U.K.
telecoms specialists, earning only around $40,000-an average sum by
European standards-may be well-placed for comparatively well-paid jobs in
newly liberalized regimes, provided they have the necessary language
skills and can adapt to a new country.

   On the other hand, telecoms professionals whose security may be threatened
by the coming deregulation must be prepared to welcome change and to work with
colleagues from other national backgrounds.

   Just how significant this movement of the skills base will be remains
to be seen. Some people now predict that as equipment becomes more
complex, but user friendly, user organizations will need smaller numbers
of better-qualified technical people and fewer low-level operators.

   The role of the European telecoms professional is on the verge of changing
along with the move to a new Europe. Since the nature of that change is
uncertain, posing a mix of both opportunity and threat, the chances that
personal and economic circumstances will be affected are enormous. The
question is, how much will inertia hinder the revolution?

'MOTHER OF ALL CONCURRENT EDITORS' DEBUTS

Researchers at the University of Florida (Gainesville) may have solved one
of the thorniest problems of distributed computing--how to give multiple
users access to the same file without having one user overwrite another's
work. The researchers have developed a word processor called The Mother of
All Concurrent Editors (MACE) that saves changes by locking only a portion
of the file. MACE works across TCP/IP networks as well as single systems.
Here's how it works: When a user calls a document, it appears on screen,
along with the names of other users working on that same document. To make
changes to the document, users lock the portion of text they are working
on. These locks are managed centrally, so that all other users are aware of
them. Other users can watch the locked text change, but they cannot
interfere. When the writer saves changes, the locks are relinquished, and
other users can access that text. MACE isn't the first concurrent editor,
but it is much larger in scope than its predecessors. It also has an open
architecture to which other applications can be added.

WELLFLEET'S STAR RISES; CISCO SNUBBED

Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) is still easily the leading vendor
of routers, but Wall Street analysts have taken note of recent inroads made
by Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.). In September, Goldman
Sachs (New York) issued a bulletin downgrading its opinion of Cisco from
''fairly valued'' to ''fully valued,'' while simultaneously reiterating its
attractive rating of Wellfleet stock. ''We think Cisco's stock is not
likely to rise further and may decline,'' the bulletin stated. Goldman
Sach's positive assessment of Wellfleet is based in part on the company's
announcement that the three major long-distance telephone companies--AT&T
Network Systems (Morristown, N.J.), US Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas
City, Mo.) and MCI Telecommunications Corp. (Washington, D.C.)--had all
signed contracts to purchase Wellfleet products for use and resale. ''This
represents a major endorsement of Wellfleet's architecture over its
competitors by a sophisticated evaluation trio,'' the Goldman bulletin
said.

VITALINK, NSC FORM R&D, MARKETING STRATEGIES

The merged companies of Vitalink Communications Corp. (Fremont, Calif.) and
Network Systems Corp. (NSC, Minneapolis) have hammered out their marketing
and product strategies. NSC's host connectivity products will be largely
unaffected by the merger. Research and development for each company's
routers will remain separate, while all marketing will be handled by
Vitalink under the leadership of its chief executive officer, Les Denend.
The router lineup will consist of Vitalink TransPath routers and TransLAN
bridges, NSC's 6000 Series routers, the 4000 Series of SNA connectivity
products from Netlink Inc. (Raleigh, N.C.) (see ''SNA, LAN, and DEC Traffic
on One Backbone,'' New Products/Internetworking, page 135), and the 8000
Series of connectivity products from Coral Network Corp. (Marlborough,
Mass.). Although the 8000 and 6000 Series overlap in some respects, the
Coral router has unique capabilities including fault tolerance, and support
for networks made up entirely of T3 or other high-speed communications
lines, Denend says. Future research and development efforts will center
mostly on 6000, 4000, and 8000 products, rather than on Vitalink's TransLAN
and TransPath products. Enhancements to the Vitalink products will involve
code upgrades and connectivity options such as frame relay, but the
architecture and capabilities will not undergo any fundamental changes or
be the basis for future products.

FTP DEVELOPERS PREFER OS/2 TO WINDOWS

Writing for Windows is like walking on thin ice, while OS/2 is a
developer's dream, at least according developers at FTP Software Inc.
(Wakefield, Mass.), which last month introduced a Windows and OS/2 versions
of its TCP/IP software, called PC/TCP. The developers say Windows crashes
if an application doesn't behave perfectly and is extremely difficult to
debug. Worse, they add, is the fact that Windows lacks many needed
facilities for communications applications. There's no way to share I/O
between multiple processes, no queuing system, and no way for DOS
applications to open device drivers at the same time. FTP had no choice but
to build all the necessary facilities itself. In contrast, the OS/2 version
of PC/TCP was a breeze to develop, the company reports.

LOW-END NICS SALES REMAIN STRONG

High-end 16- and 32-bit network interface cards (NICs) may grab the
headlines, but their sales don't come close to those for good old-fashioned
8-bit NICs, according to Lisa Alloca, senior product manager for desktop
products at Racal-Datacom (Sunrise, Fla.) and Bob Jones, director of
communications products at NCR Corp.'s Microelectronics Products Division
(Fort Collins, Colo.). The two companies last month introduced a jointly
designed Ethernet chip set and a Racal Ethernet NIC that uses the chip set.
''We've been waiting to kill off our line of 8-bit NICs for years now,''
Alloca says. She adds, however, that 8-bit NICs still account for 50
percent of all sales.

SPRINT TO LAUNCH FRAME RELAY SERVICE

US Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas City, Mo.) says it will launch its
frame relay service starting next month. The company says it has been
beta-testing the service, announced last fall, with the accounting firm of
Ernst & Young. Once it is generally available, users will be able to access
the service at 56-kbit/s, fractional T1, and T1 speeds. Sprint also will
offer a more expensive ''reserved'' service, under which customers will
always have access to a given amount of bandwidth. Standard service does
not include the guaranteed-bandwidth feature, and is priced comparably with
other frame relay services, Sprint says. Reserved service will be priced on
a monthly rate, while standard services will include both fixed and
usage-based components.

BABY BELLS START FRAME RELAY TRIALS

Pacific Bell (San Francisco) and Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. (St.
Louis) have both announced frame relay trials to begin this year.
Southwestern Bell says it will launch a general offering in early 1992;
Pacific Bell wouldn't commit to an offering, but says it is examining the
service in the context of real-world applications. Both sets of trials are
for 56-kbit/s and T1 (1.544-Mbit/s) rates. Both companies also are
considering Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) technology, and
Pacific Bell says it will offer SMDS in early 1992, pending approval by the
California Public Utilities Commission..

FRAME RELAY AT 45 MBIT/S

Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) recently added support for frame
relay protocols at 45-Mbit/s to its internetworking routers. The frame
relay support is available as part of the company's X.25/Packet switch
software, which runs on an AGS+ router equipped with a high-speed serial
interface (HSSI)/T3 interface card. Depending on the router chassis size,
the software costs $750 to $3,200.

LOOK MA, NO LAN: SOFTWARE GAINS MORE OPTIONS

Concurrent Controls Inc. (South San Francisco, Calif.) is adding more
connectivity options for its flagship Concurrent DOS software. The product,
an operating system that allows multiple users to share DOS and Windows
applications on one 386-based PC via terminal emulation. Concurrent DOS
costs $795 for a five-user package, which the company says is cheaper than
adding a LAN segment. The company plans to add support for multiple Novell
server sessions in the first quarter of 1992. Presently, Concurrent DOS
users on one PC can communicate with one NetWare server. Token ring and
Unix support are scheduled for the third quarter of 1992, the vendor says.
Concurrent DOS already contains hooks for use with Netbios application
development tools, such as ZIM from Zanthe Information Inc. (Ontario,
Canada). It also has hooks for communications packages that deploy Netbios,
particularly for communicating from PC to hosts. Concurrent DOS supports
all DOS and Microsoft Windows applications, including paged interrupt
applications that address PC serial ports, single-user
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs, and Microsoft's CD-ROM
extensions. It comes with electronic-mail and remote access capabilities,
security features, file transfer utilities, and a job scheduler that runs
unattended file transfers.

FRAME RELAY
CONGESTION MANAGEMENT:
TOO MANY OPTIONS?

By:
Nick Lippis

No matter if a network carries data, voice, or video, congestion management
is--or should be--a constant concern. And congestion management can be
boiled down to two basics: avoidance (staying out of trouble in the first
place) and recovery (getting out of the trouble you should have foreseen).
    It's not exactly brain surgery, but too many network planners and
managers still think the best way to eliminate congested links is to throw
more bandwidth (and money) at the problem. When it comes to bursty,
unpredictable internetworking traffic, though, congestion management starts
to resemble a fine art.
    The whole attempt to interconnect high-speed LANs via relatively
slow WANs presents some particularly thorny congestion problems. Part of
the trouble can be traced to the fact that computer network architectures
and telecommunications infrastructures evolved separately, so there's a
disjuncture in the way each discipline approaches congestion management.
The new virtual data services--like SMDS and frame relay--now being jointly
developed by the telecom and computing industries should go a long way
toward closing this traditional gap. But questions have been raised all
along about frame relay's congestion management abilities.
    It's true that frame relay's streamlined protocol stack reduces by
about two-thirds the processing overhead associated with X.25, the chief
alternative for public packet-switched service. But it's also true that
this streamlining means frame relay doesn't offer any of X.25's congestion
management techniques (error correction and detection, for example). When
frame relay networks reach a certain congestion threshold, the frame relay
switches start to drop packets. If the congestion becomes severe enough,
the network can collapse.
    The chief cause of this congestion is the way in which connections
are made to a frame relay network, usually via an internet nodal processor
(INP), such as integrated bridge/multiprotocol router, rather than the dumb
terminals used with X.25. For every INP, there are typically 100
end-systems (some combination of PCs, workstations, and minis) pushing
packets onto the network, which quickly adds up to a pretty hefty load.
    It's not that frame relay is without any form of congestion
management. In fact, the American National Standards Institute's ANSI
T1.618 spec addresses this issue.
    The trouble is, congestion management for frame relay is optional,
even though ANSI has defined several approaches. To date, there's no
consensus among vendors and carriers as to who will support which
alternatives.
    ANSI has specified two congestion notification bits in the frame
relay header: forward explicit congestion notification (FECN) and backward
explicit congestion notification (BECN).
    The FECN bit is set when a packet passes through a congested frame
relay switch. It's up to the INP to read the bit and notify the logical
network (DECnet, TCP/IP, IPX, AppleTalk) that it's time to throttle back on
the number of packets being sent.
    This type of congestion avoidance is a natural for connectionless
protocols that use the receiver end of a link for congestion management. In
essence, once it has been notified that the FECN bit is set, all a logical
network need do is reduce the size of the window that defines the number of
packets that can legally be sent onto the frame relay net.
    But there's a catch: Most of today's peer-to-peer protocols do not
support the FECN bit (the chief exception being DECnet Phase V/OSI). The
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), for instance, has yet to define the
one bit in the IP header that would allow it to recognize FECN. It's not a
matter of technology: The IETF, like the CCITT, can do no more than
recommend FECN; it's up to the various IP communities to implement it.
Since the FECN bit by definition limits traffic, considerate users of a
network (who work with FECN to reduce congestion) could potentially lose
out to more selfish networkers who keep pushing packets even when
congestion is present.
    The BECN bit, in comparison, informs the source rather than the
receiving end (INP) about congestion. It's thus suited to terminal-to-host
protocols like SNA that use the sender side of the link for congestion
management.
    ANSI also specifies a third congestion-avoidance mechanism,
Consolidated Link Layer Management (CLLM), which uses a reserved data link
control identifier (DLCI) to send link layer control messages to an INP.
In effect, this is an in-band signaling channel that establishes and
identifies the causes of congestion. To date, it has garnered virtually no
support from vendors.
    All of the foregoing are so-called explicit congestion control
mechanisms. It also is possible to use implicit congestion management,
based, for instance, on delays. Thus, both TCP/IP and DECnet Phase IV nodes
monitor the elapsed time between when a packet is sent and when an
acknowledgment is returned. If no acknowledgment is received within a
specified period, the node first stops sending altogether and then slowly
begins to put packets onto the network, watching to see if they are
acknowledged.
    The ANSI spec also addresses congestion recovery with the Discard
Eligibility (DE) bit. This furnishes a way to identify a permanent virtual
circuit (PVC) on a frame relay network that is causing congestion. If a PVC
exceeds its allotted burst rate (defined when the network is set up) over a
specific period, the frame relay switch sets the DE bit. If the network
starts to experience congestion, it will first drop packets that have the
DE bit set.
    The carriers also are looking to help control congestion with the
Quality Of Service (QOS) definition they supply with frame relay offerings.
A QOS comprises a burst rate, access speed, maximum number of PVCs, and
Committed Information Rate (CIR), the last of which ensures that every
permanent virtual circuit always receives its specified bandwidth.
    There is another--and some might suggest harsher--way to deal with
PVCs that flood a network with packets: Set up tariffs that severely punish
unfair or dangerous network behavior. None of the carriers have chosen this
approach--yet.
    Unfortunately, all of these strategies remain options. So what's a
network planner to do? The most important guideline is to choose an INP
vendor and carrier or frame relay switch supplier in tandem. Make sure that
one knows about and supports the other's approach to frame relay congestion
management. This may soon be simpler than it sounds: There's a growing
trend for carriers to enter into nonexclusive arrangements with INP
vendors. Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.) now has such
arrangements with AT&T, MCI, and US Sprint. Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park,
Calif.) has cut deals with CompuServe, AT&T, and WilTel.
    Right now, frame relay users should expect to see packet loss on
the order of 1 percent to 2 percent of the total sent, pretty much in
keeping with any robust, fully utilized network. It's highly unlikely that
public frame relay networks will collapse as a result of congestion--as
long as the protection afforded by the DE bit is carefully adhered to and
INP vendors implement a range of implicit and explicit management
techniques.

NET MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS: A GOOD PLACE TO START,
A BAD PLACE TO STOP

By:
Bruce Fram

Standards for network management protocols are the mom and apple pie of our
industry. But what isn't clear to many users--and isn't talked about by
many vendors--is what protocols and standards can't do. This isn't
an indictment of any particular protocol--SNMP, OSI, CMIP, NMVT, or the
like. But net management protocols--standard or otherwise--don't address
the entire management issue.
    The truth is, they don't even deal with its most critical aspects.
Network management involves more that just passing information between
devices, which is the role of the protocol. A complete solution also must
encompass the user interface, database models, and application program
interfaces (APIs).
    Yet instead of working on all these issues in concert, many vendors
are content to deliver products that boast pretty interfaces or to supply
protocols bereft of real applications or hooks into other applications. For
instance, of the 40 or so simple network management protocol (SNMP)
management stations on the market, most give users no more than simple
statistics without interpretation. Their big selling point seems to be that
they support one or more of the leading management protocols.
    Beyond nifty graphics, what's needed are databases of information
about network topology, traffic, performance, status, and the like. I'm not
talking about the management information bases (MIBs) for SNMP or the
common management information protocol/services (CMIP/
CMIS). These are meta-definitions or specifications for device-level data.
    At least, I don't mean just that data. I'm also referring tothe
network-wide information that a complete net management system or
application would use. That data is available, although getting at it means
capturing and analyzing packets, which requires the management system to
run some fairly complex calculations.
    But even if a system collects this data, consolidating it, storing
it, representing it, and making it available for reports and further
analysis requires an underlying database far beyond anything typically
available. What's missing are well-defined specifications that actually
spell out the structure of the database and specify the elements it will
contain. For instance, how will routers be represented? How often will
network utilization data be collected? If packets per second are to be
monitored, will they be data packets or broadcast packets?
    The ultimate form a net management database takes will vary
according to need and configuration. But the database and the system it
serves should be able to identify and explain faults in detail and let
users know what corrective action has been taken. What users really want
are reports and suggestions to help with capacity planning and network
design. The last thing they want is to sit in front of a monitor scrolling
through screens of data.

DON'T WAIT FOR DME

    Without common database definitions, vendors and users are severely
limited as to the network management applications they can write. Yet these
applications are the heart of network management: They're what the
interfaces, databases, and protocols exist to serve.
    That's where APIs come into the picture. By giving developers
something common to write to, they make it far simpler to write multivendor
management applications. But developers of net management APIs face
problems familiar to all software engineers: They need standards and
specifications to guide them. If it sounds circular, it is: Developers of
standard APIs themselves need clearly defined standards. Only when both
pieces of the puzzle are in place can third parties and network managers
create truly useful applications.
    The Open Software Foundation (OSF, Cambridge, Mass.) may have an
answer in its Distributed Management Environment (DME). But it's too early
to tell if its recently selected technologies will do the job or if many
net management vendors will support it. And what will happen to existing
vendor APIs is an open question.
    Meanwhile, users desperately need ways to manage multivendor
distributed networks--today. It's time users began putting the pressure on
vendors for network management tools that fit together and do the job. If
they don't vote with their pocketbooks, they'll pay the price downstream.
    For their part, vendors need to start developing
protocol-independent, value-added applications. Graphical maps make for
great demonstrations, but most don't have the depth to back those first
impressions. We need to begin defining standards for user interfaces,
database models, and APIs--as well as for management protocols.

HSSI SIZZLES
But distributed bandwidth demonstrates
there's more to the high-speed serial interface
than just speed

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Now that far-flung LANs and mainframes regularly communicate with distant
sites and data centers, network managers are increasingly concerned that
interfaces to the wide area are becoming bottlenecks, costing them speed
and bandwidth. Router, multiplexer, and channel extender suppliers say they
have an answer in HSSI, the high-speed serial interface that's now starting
to appear in products.
    According to HSSI advocates, such interfaces as V.35 and RS-422
aren't fast enough to connect multiple LANs and mainframe channels at full
speed to T3 access devices. A T3 pipe delivers 45 Mbit/s of bandwidth;
Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) and the Synchronous Optical
Network (Sonet) will be even faster. V.35 was originally intended to
support no more than 6 Mbit/s, and RS-422 tops out at 10 Mbit/s.
    HSSI, as its boosters to point out, operates at up to 52 Mbit/s.
Perhaps even more importantly, it gives users a way to allocate all the
available bandwidth as needed among HSSI-compliant data terminal equipment
(DTE)--computers, routers, channel extenders, peripherals, and so on. These
devices are connected to HSSI multiplexers or channel/data service units
(CSU/DSUs), which in turn establish links to the wide area.
    Although no one device is likely to need the full bandwidth of,
say, a T3 pipe, HSSI makes it possible to allocate the T3's 45 Mbit/s among
different DTE. V.35 and RS-422 are not designed to allocate bandwidth. For
instance, a single HSSI port on a T3 multiplexer could support six router
connections. In contrast, six V.35 interfaces would be needed to link the
same six routers.
    HSSI defines a physical and electrical interface between DTE and
data communications equipment (DCE). It was originally developed by Cisco
Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) and T3plus Networking Inc. (Santa Clara,
Calif.). The two vendors submitted it to the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) TR30.1 committee about a year ago. TR30.1 also developed
EIA-232 and V.35. HSSI's ratification is expected sometime in 1992,
according to members of TR30.1. They say the HSSI specification is not
likely to be changed significantly between now and its adoption. A number
of vendors already support HSSI, and more are expected to sign on (see
table).
    Changes in the way LANs and mainframes are used--and in the way
that the local area is viewed--are driving HSSI's acceptance. Database
systems, for instance, commonly require exchanges to take place over the
wide area as fast as if the communicating computers and resources were
located on the same physical LAN. Only a high-speed service such as T3 or
Sonet in conjunction with HSSI lets LAN speeds be maintained fully.
    What's more, as companies consolidate data centers, high-speed
links are needed to tie in mainframes at remote sites, says Richard Farmer,
product manager at Adaptive Corp. (Redwood City, Calif.). He also notes
that remote backup computers used during disaster recovery need high-speed
links to the data center.
    Also pushing HSSI along is the growing use of high-speed storage
devices, such as disk farms and tape silos (large rooms filled with
computer tapes that are accessed by robots in response to requests from
computers). This sort of storage demands high-speed mainframe channel
extension, according to Walt Hinton, product manager at McData Corp.
(Broomfield, Colo.). Mainframe operating systems that allow multiple
computers to work as one, such as IBM's Enterprise Systems Architecture
(ESA), also mandate high-speed links, he adds.
    HSSI's strong suit is distributed bandwidth. McData's 5300 HSSI
System, for instance, allocates user-specified portions of the T3 pipe to
each router, printer, and host (see Figure 1). Thus, the 5300 at Site B
allocates 10 Mbit/s to the router, 24 Mbit/s to the remote disk farm, 6
Mbit/s to the printer, and 2 Mbit/s to the PBX.
    The 5300 consists of a T3 multiplexer with HSSI interfaces and a
channel extender housed in the same cabinet. The channel extender, used in
this case to support the disk farm and printer at Site B, is connected to
the T3 multiplexer through the latter's HSSI interface. The router and PBX
at Site B also are connected to the multiplexer's HSSI interfaces.
    Specifically, HSSI makes it possible to allocate bandwidth by
establishing how routers or other DTE accept clocking from an external
source at speeds ranging from 1.5 to 52 Mbit/s. Network clocks are
typically derived from a central source (usually a clock maintained by the
providers of public network services) and passed along to all devices on a
network so that the beginnings and ends of blocks, messages, and frames can
be identified clearly.
    In most vendors' implementations of HSSI, bandwidth must be
allocated manually by the network manager to the devices connected to the
DCE. In fact, HSSI does not now specify a way for bandwidth to be allocated
dynamically.
    Dynamic allocation is obviously desirable because it eliminates the
work associated with specifying how much bandwidth a router or channel
extender is to receive. More importantly, it improves network performance
by accommodating bursty applications and users who come on-line with
bandwidth-hungry applications without warning.
    Some vendors, such as Newbridge Networks Inc. (Herndon, Va.), have
devised proprietary schemes that allow their HSSI multiplexers to allocate
bandwidth dynamically. Newbridge uses simple network management protocol
(SNMP) messages to enable routers and channel extenders to signal
multiplexers that additional bandwidth is needed. Most vendors agree,
however, that it makes far more sense for HSSI's backers to work together
to extend HSSI or devise a standard approach to dynamic allocation.
    HSSI also does not specify how multiplexers or similar devices are
to transmit data over the wide area. Most vendors' equipment gathers data
from attached networking gear and sends it as one DS-3 stream over a public
data service. DS-3 specifies 44.736 Mbit/s; T3, Sonet, and SMDS all accept
DS-3 as an input.
    When configured in a mesh network, multiplexers typically send the
DS-3 stream over the best possible route available at the time of
transmission. If that route fails, the data can be rerouted onto another
network link that furnishes a path to the destination.
    Once the DS-3 stream arrives at the receiving DCE, it is broken
down and specific data is sent to the appropriate devices (hosts, channel
extenders, routers, printers, PBXs, disk farms, and the like).
    Adaptive and T3plus have taken this basic approach one step
further. They allow data streams from individual devices connected to the
same HSSI interface to be routed to different destinations, over both T1
and T3 communications lines.
    Adaptive has implemented HSSI for its Sonet Transmission Manager,
or STM (see Figure 2). The switching facility maps a data stream coming
from a HSSI interface into multiple DS-1 channels. DS-1 specifies
1.544-Mbit/s transmissions.
    The STM's matrix switch can either combine DS-1s to transmit a DS-3
data stream or transmit separate DS-1 channels over multiple T1 lines
rather than one T3. In the latter case, the DS-1s are reassembled into a
DS-3 by the receiving STM, so data can be routed through the receiving
STM's HSSI interface to the appropriate device.
    Adaptive's and T3plus's ability to use multiple low-speed lines to
form a high-bandwidth link between two nodes gives users three additional
benefits. First, it allows network nodes to be installed in areas where
high-speed facilities may not yet be available. Second, it adds fault
tolerance, since more links can be established between nodes. Priorities
also can be established among HSSI connections to ensure immediate
recovery in the event of a network failure.
    Third, any one HSSI port connected to the STM's matrix switch
actually has more bandwidth available than would be provided by a single
DS-3. For example, it is possible for a router and host to be connected to
a remote router and host over both a T3 and a T1 line. Together, the T3 and
T1 deliver more bandwidth between two STMs than would a single T3. The
bottleneck in an STM network thus becomes the HSSI interface itself rather
than the T3 line.
    HSSI's place as the preferred interface to high-speed
communications lines seems secure. But not everyone is sold on HSSI. Some
vendors point out that although it was originally designed for 6-Mbit/s
transmissions, V.35 can be pressed into faster service.
    Network Systems Corp. (NSC, Minneapolis), for example, uses V.35
interfaces in its supercomputer connection equipment and routers to provide
access to T3 transmission equipment at up to 40 Mbit/s. ''There is no
advantage to HSSI over V.35,'' asserts Bill Way, product marketing manager
at NSC.
    HSSI proponents disagree. While it's true that multiple V.35s can
be made to access T3, HSSI provides better electrical characteristics,
according to Jim Michaels, vice president of network planning at
Newbridge.
    Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.) intends to support
HSSI but doesn't believe the interface offers real benefits today. HSSI is
only an electrical interface. What is most important is having the
processing power to move packets at the speed the interface allows, says
Richard Yates, product marketing manager. Another prerequisite is off-the-
shelf HDLC controller chips that support HSSI speeds, says Yates. Until
these are shipped, HSSI interfaces, he maintains, will be expensive.

CANNED HELP FOR LAN PROBLEMS: EFFECTIVE, BUT LIMITED
Expert systems from HP and Network General can solve some LAN problems
fast, but they can't be fine-tuned

By:
Mary Jander

When they're at their best, expert systems offer the collective wisdom of a
team of first-rate troubleshooters--without the high salaries, ego clashes,
and other fringe benefits such groups tend to engender. The expert systems
unveiled recently by two leading LAN protocol analyzer vendors work more
like second-line technicians: They do a good job of handling problems that
are familiar to them, but they can't be trained to try different approaches
or to handle new problems.
    Both Network Advisor from Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Colorado
Telecommunications Division (Colorado Springs, Colo.) and Expert Sniffer
from Network General Corp. (Menlo Park, Calif.) can detect, diagnose, and
solve such LAN problems as duplicate addresses, cable breaks, and improper
node insertions in a matter of minutes. That not only saves LAN
administrators time and effort, but it also allows them to focus their
attention on other management issues.
    The down side to both packages, at least for now, is that the
canned wisdom they hold cannot be added to or altered. HP and Network
General enlisted the help of teams of network experts to develop their
respective knowledge bases for LAN troubleshooting, but users can't change
those knowledge bases to meet their specific needs. HP has indicated that
it plans to give users the power to add logic to its expert system, but a
delivery date for that addition has not been announced.
    The inability to customize the knowledge bases limits the utility
of both packages and has some users and competing vendors wondering whether
expert LAN analyzers are worth the trouble and expense to install at this
point. One beta user of Expert Sniffer reports that although the expert
system can uncover some critical flaws in the network, it also wastes time
tracking and solving problems that either aren't important or aren't
correctable, such as intermittent packet storms. Others note that some of
the expert analyzers' troubleshooting features already are available in
products like the LANalyzer from Novell Inc.'s LANalyzer Products Division
(San Jose, Calif.).

EXPERTS AT WORK

    HP's Network Advisor, which began shipping this past summer,
comprises an HP 4970 LAN protocol analyzer and Fault Finder expert-systems
software. Network General announced and demonstrated its Expert Sniffer in
September; the product will ship sometime in the first half of next year
and will be made available as an upgrade to users of the vendor's Sniffer
analyzer.
    The two products are in the same general price range. A Network
Advisor capable of handling both Ethernet and token ring LANs costs
$25,500. When it becomes available, Expert Sniffer will cost from $12,500
to $24,000, depending on whether users buy a card-only analyzer or a
complete platform including a portable computer. In contrast, Novell's
LANalyzer costs $12,500 for a board and software that handles either
Ethernet or token ring and $19,980 for a package that handles both LAN
types.
    Network Advisor and Expert Sniffer have many features in common.
Both work with Ethernet and token ring networks. Both invoke the expert
system as a function of the analyzer, treating the expert system like
another type of decoding program. In addition to providing media access
control (MAC)-layer troubleshooting, the expert systems use the decoding
functions of their respective analyzers to report on problems in
upper-layer protocols. For instance, if a file transfer can't be completed
because of a faulty packet, Expert Sniffer reports the problem to the user,
according to Network General. Among the protocols handled by both expert
analyzers are TCP/IP, DECnet, and Internet Packet Exchange (IPX). Neither
system handles WAN protocols.
    HP built its Fault Finder expert system with Smalltalk, a set of
DOS-compatible development tools from Digitalk Inc. (Los Angeles). In HP's
scheme, analyzer functions, such as decode tests, statistical monitoring
programs, and diagnostic tests, are organized in such a way that they can
be activated automatically in response to certain queries and hypotheses
posed by the expert system. As various hypotheses are tested, they lead to
more tests or to final decisions, which are posted graphically or in text
form on Network Advisor's display (see figure).
    For example, if a network technician is having trouble inserting a
new node onto a Novell NetWare token ring, he or she can activate Fault
Finder, which then tests the LAN for broken transmit or receive wires and
checks for responses from all network interface cards on the ring. If the
wires are intact and all other stations are responding, the system then
checks for other possible causes, such as an incorrect speed setting on the
network card in the new node.
    The initial version of Fault Finder uses what is known as a
rule-based approach to expert systems. In the rule-based approach, the
expert system's code contains hypotheses and solutions for each type of LAN
problem for each possible set of circumstances. In a sense, rule-based
expert-systems code can be thought of as containing an exhaustive list of
''if-then'' statements.
    In contrast, Expert Sniffer uses what Network General calls a
blackboard approach. The vendor says its expert system continually gathers
and sifts certain information about the network, such as routing paths,
applications, protocols, station types, and user names. The expert system
uses this information to create a problem matrix that enables it to
pinpoint problems without running through the gamut of possibilities
required by a rule-based system. Network General claims Expert Sniffer's
''learning'' capabilities make it more adaptable to individual networks. HP
says it will add a similar self-learning feature to Network Advisor in an
upgrade scheduled to be released this month.

KNOWLEDGE LIMITS

    The inability to modify the knowledge base of either Network Advisor
or Expert Sniffer can be particularly frustrating for users. Because of
this inflexibility, users can't add their own expertise to the analyzer or
modify the analyzer's responses to reflect specific networking
requirements.
    HP reportedly is investigating a way to let users add to Network
Advisor's knowledge base without disturbing its structure. Network General,
however, has announced no plans to let users alter Expert Sniffer's
knowledge base.
    Although users of either system can't alter the information in the
knowledge base, they can make some adjustments to the parameters the
systems measure. To set the thresholds or levels of packet activity
monitored by the system, Network Advisor users can exit the system and edit
an ASCII file containing that information. The edited file then is loaded
into the analyzer. Expert Sniffer's main menu offers users the option of
entering such data via an electronic form.
    One test user of Network General's Expert Sniffer gives the product
a qualified endorsement for LAN troubleshooting. Dell Holmes, lead analyst
in the computer technology services division of Halliburton Corp.
(Arlington, Texas), an engineering and construction conglomerate, says the
product can help save time for highly skilled technicians who already use
Sniffers to troubleshoot LAN problems. Instead of having to list a range of
hypotheses and test them systematically, technicians can activate Expert
Sniffer from the main Sniffer menu. According to Holmes, Expert Sniffer can
cut the time it takes to diagnose certain problems from hours to minutes.

PROS AND CONS

    While HP and Network General move ahead with their expert
analyzers, some other vendors hope to release expert products of their own
in the near future. Lexcel (formerly Micro Technology Inc., Fullerton,
Calif.) says it plans to add expert-systems technology to its Lance+
analyzer, which uses Novell's LANtern monitoring device to gather
information on packet activity in multiple LAN segments.
    The latest release of Lance+ has a fault-determination feature that
correlates the measurements taken by the network monitor with information
in Lance+'s relational database. This technique helps to locate the causes
of network problems more precisely, Lexcel says. With older versions of
Lance, when a hub caused a problem on a LAN segment, all the devices
attached to the hub were turned red on the monitor's graphical display.
With the new feature, only the hub turns red on the display. The addition
of an expert system will streamline this procedure even more: Instead of
having to activate a fault-detection program to get information about
problems, users will be notified automatically that a problem has occurred
and how it can be solved.
    Other vendors are acting as though they aren't convinced that
expert systems are the answer for LAN analyzers and monitoring gear.
Novell's LANalyzer Products Division, ProTools Inc. (Beaverton, Ore.), and
Spider Systems Inc. (Burlington, Mass.) all say they are considering adding
expert systems to their analyzers, but they provide only sketchy
information as to when and how they'll do so.
    Novell, in fact, points out that some features offered by the new
expert analyzers are already available in products like its LANalyzer.
LANalyzer's Automated Troubleshooting System lets users automate the steps
to be taken if certain types of network problems occur. For instance, if
performance degrades, the Automated Troubleshooting System can activate a
series of tests that check how many packets of which protocol are running
on the LAN. The system contains a template that users can call up from the
main menu to specify network conditions or thresholds at which certain
types of tests should be activated. Users can choose specific tests and
test sequences for each situation; they also can create new tests or alter
existing ones, Novell says.

SECOND OPINIONS

    Some industry developments could complement or even replace the
functions that expert systems provide to LAN analyzers and monitors. The
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is now working on a simple network
management protocol (SNMP) management information base (MIB) that could
speed the addition of expert systems to LAN analyzers and monitors. The new
MIB, called the remote monitoring (RMON) MIB, not only will set up a means
for transmitting information from analyzers and monitors to SNMP management
stations but also will specify a way for SNMP coding to direct the
automatic testing of LANs by analyzers or monitors.
    In this case, expert systems could be added to existing SNMP
management stations rather than to LAN analyzers or monitors. Several
vendors that sell both LAN analyzers and SNMP management stations,
including HP, Lexcel, Network General, Novell, ProTools, and Spider, are
active on the IETF's RMON MIB committee, and all of them claim to be in the
process of adding support for the RMON MIB to their products.

BBN GREEN LIGHTS BUSLESS SWITCH
Emerald's high-speed switching module hits 160 Mbit/s full duplex for
aggregate throughput in the gigabit range

By:
Johna Till Johnson

BBN Communications thinks buses are just fine for crosstown traffic, but
they really don't belong inside corporate backbone processors. That's why
the venerable high-tech vendor has gone busless with Emerald, its recently
announced next-generation architecture for cell switching.
    Instead of a bus, BBN has come up with a switching module that
delivers port-to-port connectivity at 160 Mbit/s in full-duplex mode,
yielding an aggregate switching speed of several gigabits per second.
    Most of today's switches are built around buses, as are the
majority of multiplexers, computers, and microprocessor-based products. But
for very fast data transfers, even a high-speed bus can turn into a
bottleneck.
    Going busless is something of a family trait at BBN. Its parent
company, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. (Cambridge, Mass.), developed a
concurrent supercomputer, the Butterfly, based on a similar busless
design.
    BBN clearly is hoping that its new architecture, which won't see
light as a product until late next year, will make the company as
successful with cell switches as it has been in the X.25 packet-switch
market, where it is a leading player.
    Assuming it can build a workable product, BBN then must decide
whether to license the technology to others or sell it itself.
    Building an Emerald cell switch might seem to make sense at first,
but some observers point out that the demand for cell switches may not be
strong until the end of this decade, which would keep the architecture out
of use for several years. If the company were to license the technology,
however, parts of it could be appearing in routers and multiplexers--as
well as switches--as early as the end of next year.
    Joaquin Gonzalez, vice president and service director for global
networking strategies at the Meta Group Inc. (Westport, Conn.), is among
those who see cell switching in the wide area decidedly in the future
tense--possibly as late as 1997. Gonzalez thinks cell relay won't catch on
in the U.S. until there is an application driving it, such as
desktop-to-desktop multimedia. That's why he thinks BBN should license the
technology to internetworking vendors, which would bring it to market much
faster.
    Potential users for an Emerald product include companies with large
networking needs, particularly carriers and alternative carriers, says
Robert Bellman, vice president of marketing for BBN. Fortune 100 companies
are another good bet, since many of their applications--such as tying
together fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) networks across the wide
area, imaging, and transporting isochronous voice and data--require a great
deal of bursty bandwidth.
    ''Cell switching in the kind of product we're developing is the
only technology that can handle bursty traffic and be efficient at the same
time,'' says Mark Lunardoni, a product line manager at BBN.

DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS

    Its busless design enables Emerald to handle the high speeds
inherent in cell switching. Bob Hinden, senior technologist at BBN, points
out that because it's a shared resource, a bus acts as a bottleneck in the
data flow. Whenever one subsystem--say, a line card or processor--wants to
transmit data, it asks for sole access to the bus. This means other
subsystems must wait until the first one finishes before they can send
data. At low throughputs, it's possible to make the bus much faster than
the port connections. This isn't feasible, however, at multimegabit or
gigabit speeds.
    Another drawback with a bus-based architecture is that it's not
inherently scalable. As more subsystems are added, performance drops
because each subsystem must contend with the others to gain access to the
bus. The more subsystems, the greater the contention and the longer average
wait before any given subsystem gets the bus.
    In the Emerald approach, each line card accesses the switch
directly, so there are always full-bandwidth paths between cards on the
switch (see figure). Adding line cards doesn't reduce the performance,
because cards aren't in competition for the bandwidth.
    Key to the success of this approach is distributed
processing--putting intelligence on the line cards as well as in the
central processor. The line cards have two functions: They convert incoming
data to 53-byte cells (Emerald uses 53-byte cells with a 48-byte payload,
the standard size for asynchronous transfer mode), and they forward the
cells along the appropriate paths.
    Most cells traverse the switch without ever using the central
processor, which is thus freed to handle global issues, such as management
and flow setup. When a line card receives a packet of data, it parses the
header to determine where it's going. If there is an existing path (or
flow), the line card breaks the packet into cells and forwards the cells
along it. If not, the line card alerts the processor, which establishes a
new flow.
    Most cells travel along an established flow, says Hinden, which
means the burden of packet processing shifts from the processor to the line
cards.
    The combination of busless architecture and distributed processing
makes Emerald scalable and modular. Line cards can be added without slowing
performance; the switch module also can be upgraded. BBN won't give
specifics on the number of line cards that can be accommodated or what the
switch module can be upgraded to. Nonetheless, scalability is good news for
potential users. It means they can purchase a smaller version of the
switch, then upgrade as needs grow and budget permits. (BBN also is not
releasing pricing details.)
    A final feature of Emerald's is its ability to connect to LANs.
Although BBN again is keeping mum about specifics, some line cards will
connect to token ring, Ethernet, and FDDI. The design also will include
frame relay interfaces.

WOLLONGONG BUYS A EUROPEAN CUSTOMER BASE

The Wollongong Group Inc. (Palo Alto, Calif.) has acquired a majority stake
in network integrator European Network Engineering (ENE, Brussels, Belgium)
with an eye toward providing networks that use Wollongong's Unix, VMS,
Apple Macintosh, Sun, and TCP/IP connectivity software on a range of
workstations, routers, bridges, cabling, and other networking devices
supplied by ENE. Wollongong won't disclose the exact size of its share in
ENE, but says it is greater than 50 percent. For Wollongong, ENE's chief
attraction is its customer base, which includes British Rail and the U.K.
divisions of Price Waterhouse and KPMG, formerly Peat Marwick. Wollongong
says it anticipates ENE's revenues, now about $5 million annually, to grow
by 40 percent to 50 percent as a result of the arrangement. Wollongong's
revenues, now at about $30 million annually, also are expected to grow.

SOUTH AFRICAN COMPANY PULLS OUT OF TIMEPLEX/ASCOM DEAL

Ascom Holding AG (Bern, Switzerland) has completed its purchase of network
equipment maker Timeplex Inc. (Woodcliff Lake, N.J.) from computer maker
Unisys Corp. (Blue Bell, Pa.). Originally, Unisys announced that Timeplex
would be purchased by a joint venture involving Ascom and Mercedes
Information Technologies Pty. Ltd. (MIT, Johannesburg, South Africa). MIT
pulled out of the deal, however, and Ascom now owns all of Timeplex. MIT
cited South African government regulations on foreign investment as the
reason for its withdrawal, but analysts suspect that the change has more to
do with Ascom's desire for sole ownership and its uncertainty about how
Timeplex would be managed by two owners. ''The thought of trying to control
Timeplex proved a little more hairy than anyone wanted,'' says Jim
Harrison, program director for global network strategies at the Meta Group
Inc. (Westport, Conn.), a market research firm.

AT&T CUTSLONG-DISTANCE T1 AND FRACTIONAL T1 PRICES. . .

AT&T has filed tariff revisions that would lower the cost of long-haul T1
and fractional T1 circuits. The changes, which will take effect this month
pending Federal Communications Commission approval, will affect monthly
rates for Accunet T1.5 services, Accunet Spectrum of Digital Services
(ASDS), and Voice Grade Private Line (VGPL) services. Accunet T1.5 prices
will rise for short-haul circuits and fall for long-haul T1 and fractional
T1 lines. The crossover point from increases to reductions occurs for
circuits longer than 150 miles. T1 service from New Jersey to California,
for example, falls from roughly $19,000 to roughly $17,000 per month;
384-kbit/s fractional T1 service on the same link drops from around $7,000
per month to around $5,500.

ATM FORUM TO PROMOTE INTEROPERABILITY

A forum dedicated to the further development and implementation of
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) specifications was founded last month. The
ATM Forum (San Jose, Calif.) aims to develop a specification for a
permanent virtual circuit ATM interface. ATM is a form of switching that
carries data in small, fixed-length packets called cells. The forum's
interface specification, expected to be available next spring, will allow
companies to design interoperable ATM products and services. Standards
governing ATM transport already have been developed by the CCITT and ANSI.
The forum's goal is not to contest these standards or to set itself up as a
rival standards body, but to ensure that standards are implemented by
equipment vendors and service providers, according to Charlie Giancarlo, a
founder of Adaptive Corp. (Redwood City, Calif.) and a charter member of
the forum. At press time, other members included Northern Telecom
(Mississauga, Ontario), Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.), and US
Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas City, Mo.). Ungermann-Bass Inc. (Santa
Clara, Calif.) and Wellfleet Communications Inc. (Bedford, Mass.)
reportedly are interested in joining the forum.

DIRECT FAX LINKS PLANNED FOR DOS, WINDOWS, AND UNIX

Thanks to an impending standard, users soon may be able to fax documents
directly from word processing or spreadsheet applications running under
DOS, Microsoft Windows, or Unix. FaxBios, an application program interface
(API) from the FaxBios Association (Berkeley, Calif.), a vendor consortium,
is the first standard to cover multiple operating systems. Initially,
FaxBios will work only under DOS, but later releases will support Unix and
Windows. An earlier standard, the Communicating Applications Specification
(CAS), allowed documents to be faxed from an application, but only under
DOS. ''For a company like WordPerfect, only supporting DOS is an
unrecoverable flaw--we just can't be limited to one operating system,''
says Richard Holder, manager of peripheral products for the Corporate Lab
of WordPerfect Corp. (Orem, Utah) and information officer for the FaxBios
Association. Association members include Hewlett-Packard Co. (Palo Alto,
Calif.), Everex Systems Inc. (Fremont, Calif.), and Biscom Inc. (Billerica,
Mass.).

OSPF GETS SEAL OF APPROVAL

The open shortest path first (OSPF) routing protocol drew a major
endorsement over its rival, dual intermediate system-to-intermediate
system (IS-IS), from the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG). The
IESG, which until now has given equal footing to the two protocols,
recommended that OSPF be made mandatory for all TCP/IP routers. ''We've
put the official gold star of approval on OSPF,'' says Noel Chiappa, area
director for the Internet. Vendors can still offer dual IS-IS, but they
must support OSPF as well.

SNMP MANAGEMENT FOR PROTOCOL ANALYZERS

Users may soon be able to use the simple network management protocol (SNMP)
to manage their network analyzers. The Internet Engineering Steering Group
(IESG) has recommended that a remote monitoring (RMON) management
information base (MIB) be advanced to proposed standard status. The RMON
MIB defines the SNMP values collected by analyzers. Several vendors already
are said to be using prototypes of the RMON MIB. Actual products could be
released as early as next year.

VIEWING THE FUTURE
FROM INTEROP

By:
Joseph Braue, Editor in Chief

Trade journalists must have a streak of fortune teller in the blood, given
how we love to try to predict where the industry is headed. But at last
month's Interop, I thought I'd give my crystal ball a rest. Instead, I
quizzed several of the industry's top execs as to what they think the big
stories will be over the next two years.
    For Frank Gratzer, a Bellcore division manager and point man for
the Baby Bells' Switched Multimegabit Data Service rollouts, the future is
SMDS. Plans now call for tariffed SMDS by the end of '92 or early '93 in 30
cities. With Bell Atlantic quoting a flat $500 monthly fee and an $800
installation charge per site, SMDS is starting to make sense for companies
with three or four sites in a metropolitan area that need to be connected.
    Eric Benhamou, president and CEO of 3Com Corp., sees SMDS, frame
relay, ISDN, and Switched 56 as technologies whose time is at hand. He
believes such services will reduce the number of WAN ports that bridges and
routers must pack, paving the way for cheaper, smaller internetworking
gear. Will corporations trust mission-critical data to carriers? Benhamou
says over time they will.
    The future of intelligent wiring hubs lies with cell relay,
according to Ralph Ungermann and Andy Ludwick, who are president and CEO,
respectively, of Ungermann-Bass Inc. and SynOptics Communications Inc.
Faster LANs (thanks to FDDI) and higher-bandwidth applications will push
hubs to asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology.
    Routers look to be headed for some interesting times, since three
of the industry's top execs are stressing different trends. Wellfleet's
Paul Severino, president of Wellfleet Communications Inc., sees 1992 as
more network management and deeper integration of internetworking
functions. John Morgridge, president of Cisco Systems Inc., looks to the
coming year as a time for further integrating SNA and increasing the
emphasis on low-end sales. And Patrick Courtin, president of Proteon Inc.,
sees users creating enterprise-wide applications on top of internetworking
devices and teaching staff to support them.
    Who's right? As soon as we know, you'll know. And you won't need a
crystal ball, either.

TRANSATLANTIC
DIAL-UP LINKS:
STILL HIT OR MISS

By:
Tom Mangan, Lead Technologies

In real-world data communications, the whole often is less than the sum of
its parts. This lesson in mathematical illogic is painfully evident to
anyone who tries to establish transatlantic data links using dial-up lines.
The fiber optic cables that now cross the Atlantic have vastly improved the
line quality for voice calls, while advancements in modems have pushed the
speed envelope for data transmissions over domestic dial-up lines. Somehow,
however, these two developments have not added up to reliable, consistent
dial-up data communications.
    Of course, a few years ago no one would have even tried to set up a
dial-up data connection across the big pond. Most of the dial-up links
between the U.S. and Europe--for that matter, most intercontinental
links--were carried by satellite service. The echo, delay, and other random
noise associated with satellite transmissions made trying to establish
anything other than a low-speed (300- or 1,200-bit/s) data connection
virtually impossible. Most users turned to leased lines or X.25 services
for transatlantic data exchanges. Others put disks or tapes in pouches and
sent them via overnight delivery services.
    The arrival of transatlantic fiber cables TAT-8 and PTAT-1 gave
hope that reliable dial-up data links had arrived. But a recent project to
set up such connections has taught me otherwise.
    Our project involved connecting two IBM AS/400 computers, one in
the U.S. and one in the U.K., on an occasional basis for a client. The
AS/400 on the client's U.S. side (in Langhorne, Pa.) provides program
development and operational support to the U.K. system, located in
Tunbridge, Kent, about 100 miles outside of London. The client wanted the
U.S. AS/400 tobe able to dial up the U.K. machine and establish a
synchronous SNA Logical Unit 6.2 link.
    We considered using X.25 for the link, but ruled that option out
quickly because of cost. X.25 access charges in the U.K. are on the
prohibitive side. So we decided on the next obvious option, international
direct dial-up lines.
    At first, we used V.32 modems from two different manufacturers. We
chose to let SNA take care of error detection and correction. After some
tweaking of the modems and software, we were able to establish a dial-up
connection between the U.S. and the U.K.--but our success rate was only
about 20 percent. The other 80 percent of the time, we would get as far as
hearing the U.K. modem answer the call, only to have the U.S. modem drop
the line. When we did establish a link, we could maintain the line at 4.8
kbit/s, but 9.6 kbit/s was chancy. We tried adjusting the modems and
software further to improve our success rate, but to no avail.
    We then decided to replace the modems we were using with a matched
set from a single manufacturer. After adjusting the new modems, our success
rate improved from 20 percent to 60 percent. A 60 percent completion rate
is fine for a quarterback, but for corporate networkers it's disastrous.
    Our next move was to check the quality of the circuits. The
client's carrier on the U.S. side is AT&T. I had noticed that although most
voice calls to the U.K. site had good sound quality and lacked delay
characteristics, the calls were half duplex. Also, when a call was
established, the line emitted what can best be described as a
high-frequency glitch before the conversation could begin. Another factor
that began to be apparent was that starting around 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time,
the chances of getting a clean line for data decreased rapidly.
    We wondered why, with all the fiber optic circuits now linking the
U.S. and Europe, transatlantic connections were so unlike placing a call
within the U.S. We also wondered about using AT&T's Global Software Defined
Network (GSDN)--the client is an AT&T SDN user and was considering using
GSDN for placing calls to the U.K. site. In the U.S., SDN is primarily a
pricing mechanism; SDN calls use the same facilities as the rest of the
AT&T customer base. Would using GSDN make any difference?
    Armed with all these questions, we contacted AT&T for some help.
This turned out to be quite an adventure on its own. One AT&T
representative told us that overseas data rates were still limited to 300
to 1,200 bit/s. But a rep from AT&T Paradyne told us that AT&T Paradyne had
run several successful overseas dial-up tests with its modems at speeds up
to 14.4 kbit/s. The caveat for our project was that these tests were
conducted with sites located within major cities. We asked about test
results covering outlying areas, but such tests didn't seem to exist.
    No one we contacted at AT&T was able to provide a good, firm
technical explanation as to why we couldn't establish reliable dial-up
calls with the U.K. site. We speculated that since our location was in a
small town outside of London, the switching of the call through older
central offices in the U.K. might be the cause of the problem. Also, as
traffic built during the morning, the carrier might be switching some
traffic over older facilities (or even satellite) across the Atlantic.
    Research into the use of GSDN gave us some hope. AT&T works with
British Telecommunications PLC's version of SDN, called FeatureNet. This
service uses only one switching point in the U.K., which means we could run
an access line from our site to the FeatureNet node to bypass any older
central offices. Also, AT&T claimed that about 90 percent of the calls
placed with GSDN would travel on fiber facilities. And GSDN's product
specifications indicated that the network would support dial-up data rates
of 4.8 kbit/s, with 9.6 kbit/s ''permissive.''
    For now, our client will use dial-up lines with matched modems,
until a GSDN line is installed at the U.K. site. GSDN won't be a
cheapsolution: A FeatureNet access line now costs about $1,000 per quarter
(not counting usage). But it may be worth it if the success rate
increases.
    This adventure--or misadventure--has only reinforced my belief that
long-distance dial-up data communications is a hit-or-miss proposition.
Within the U.S., we have improved the odds with lots of fiber optic
facilities and better modems. But the odds are less favorable on the
international front, even though intercontintental transmission facilities
are improving rapidly. The odds won't get better until the local
infrastructures improve.
    Although AT&T didn't exactly distinguish itself on this project, I
doubt that the other U.S. carriers could have done any better. There isn't
much that any carrier can do when a call from its network is delivered to a
country that hasn't upgraded its local transmission and switching
facilities. Data calls to large cities stand a better chance of being
completed, but watch out in the outlying areas.
    Users who need to set up occasional international data
transmissions should first explore X.25. For small file transfers,
international public electronic-mail services are another option.
    If dial-up lines are the best alternative, a couple of steps may
help improve the odds on getting connections that work. The first is to
install matched modems from the same manufacturer--no small feat given the
government approvals required for equipment. That will allow you to do
''matched tweaking'' on obscure options such as turn around time,
disconnect signals, and the like. Another is to explore any advantages that
might be obtained from global virtual voice network services.
    One more word of advice: Keep the telephone number of your
overnight delivery service handy.

LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION . . . BREAKING INTO VIDEOCONFERENCING

By:
J.T.J.

Videoconferencing's recent drop in price and increased picture quality make
it a very appealing technology. But before network managers shout ''Roll
cameras'' or shell out any money for a system, they should consider the
following:
    Ann Earon, president of Telemanagement Resources International
(TRI, Lake Wylie, S.C.) advises: ''If you don't know what your needs are,
there's no point in buying technology.'' She suggests network managers find
out who within their companies needs videoconferencing, what kind of
technology is required, and where and how it's likely to be used. Then, she
says, ''set a benchmark for success,'' a way to determine whether the
videoconferencing system actually is helping the company. TRI designs
corporate videoconferencing systems and conducts seminars in this and other
telecommunications technologies.
    Success, she notes, can initially be measured by how often the
equipment is used. Another measurement can be travel dollars saved or
increased productivity.
    William Ray, director of communications network services for
Corning Inc. (Corning, N.Y.), points out that he took an active role in
finding out just who in his company could benefit from videoconferencing
and pumping up the technology. Before going ahead with a company-wide
installation, he found an executive willing to spend money from his own
budget to install a system. Ray paid for one unit and the executive paid
for the other.
    Ray set up a pilot system, and the executive started to realize his
project was being finished faster than planned. Meanwhile, Ray used the
pilot system as a live demonstration for other employees. ''Once people
could see the benefit, it started finding its way into other operating
units.'' Corning Inc. now has videoconferencing sites at its central
headquarters and at plants throughout the United States and in Tokyo.
    Ron Stevenson, the program manager for telecommunications at
General Electric Co.'s Corporate Information Technology division
(Fairfield, Conn.), tells a similar story. GE has had a videoconferencing
network in place for the past two and a half years. It links over 50 sites
across the United States and overseas and is tied into videoconferencing
networks at other companies.
    Before installing the network, Stevenson says, he distributed a
questionnaire asking employees about their meeting and travel habits. He
stresses that he didn't ask employees their opinions regarding
videoconferencing per se. Stevenson analyzed his data to see where
videoconferencing would save on travel costs and increase productivity. He
later wrote a company-wide guide about videoconferencing that gives
detailed breakdowns of the costs of trips and meetings and demonstrates how
and when videoconferencing might save.
    Although network managers might believe videoconferencing will cut
travel costs dramatically, this isn't always the case. Stevenson estimates
that 20 percent to 50 percent of travel can be displaced by
videoconferencing. In some manufacturing and engineering companies, the
real benefits may come in time saved designing and building systems.
    Furthermore, Earon points out that videoconferencing may actually
increase travel costs for a given configuration. If a company with several
outlying sites installs videoconferencing at its main sites, there might be
less travel between those two cities but more from outlying sites to
headquarters to use the videoconferencing facilities.

THE BIG PICTURE FOR H.261

By:
J.T.J.

Key to videoconferencing is the H.261 Recommendation, which the
International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) signed
off on in December 1990. It specifies how video bit streams are to be sent
across the network (at rates that are multiples of 64 kbit/s). Codecs that
incorporate this standard should be able to work together.
    H.261 also establishes a format for video, still-frame, and
high-resolution graphics--the Common Intermediate Format (CIF)--but
H.261-compatible codecs can conform either to CIF or to the Quarter CIF
(QCIF) subset. QCIF establishes lower video resolution than CIF (176 pixels
by 144 lines compared with 352 pixels by 288 lines). It also allows lower
resolution for graphics.
    Beyond decoding compressed video and displaying images in a
standard manner, codecs must establish communications across a network link
and compress and transmit the audio portion of a videoconference. Any
H.261-compatible codec must by definition conform to the CCITT
Recommendations that specify these functions. These recommendations fall
into two main categories: communications and control, and audio.
Communications and control specs include H.221, H.230, H.242, and H.320.
H.221 covers the frame structure of the videoconferencing link. H.230
describes the commands that each codec must be able to send, receive, and
interpret, such as loopback notification. H.242 handles call setup and
recognition, defining, for example, how two codecs establish data rates,
number of lines, and disconnect procedures. Finally, H.320 identifies the
equipment and system needed for narrow-bandwidth audiovisual
transmissions.
    Audio standards are spelled out in Recommendations G.711 and G.722.
While these weren't specifically developed for videoconferencing, many
codec vendors have adopted them. G.711 defines a 64-kbit/s encoding
algorithm that uses pulse code modulation (PCM); G.722 calls for 32 to 64
kbit/s of bandwidth using adaptive differential PCM (ADPCM). G.722 is
basically an improvement on G.711.
    Given these recommendations, it's possible to believe that
videoconferencing standards are well-nigh complete. But that's far from the
case. First, there are areas the CCITT has specifically chosen not to
standardize: video pre- and post- processing. It's this processing that
determines to a large degree the clarity of an image and processing delay
times.
    Second, there are areas that remain to be standardized, including
multipoint bridging, low-bit-rate audio encoding, encryption, and image
storage. Without a multipoint bridging spec, a vendor's codecs will only
operate with its own bridges. H.230 defines some of the necessary commands,
but the topic also is the subject of CCITT AV.254, which is still in
development. Ratification is not expected until 1992 or later. The CCITT is
just starting to work on low-bit-rate (16-kbit/s) audio and encryption;
low-bit-rate audio will free up more bandwidth for other purposes (such as
fax transmission). Encryption will help protect conference transmissions
against eavesdropping.
    Image-storage standards are under development by International
Standards Organizations (ISO) groups. The Moving Picture Experts Group, for
instance, is developing a spec for storing H.261-compatible video on hard
drives and optical disks. The Joint Photographic Experts Group is doing
similar work for digitized still-frame graphics.

FREEZE FRAME ON VIDEOCONFERENCING

By:
J.T.J.

To each its own'' is an apt description of the U.S. codec market. Of the
industry's Big Three, Compression Labs Inc. (CLI, San Jose, Calif.)
PictureTel Corp. (Peabody, Mass.), and VideoTelecom Corp. (Austin, Texas),
CLI is shooting for the high end. Its Rembrandt codecs are perhaps the best
known in the industry and tend to be perceived as top performers at high
bandwidths (384 kbit/s to 2.048 Mbit/s). The company also is hoping to put
its compression algorithms to work in high-definition television (HDTV) and
one-way business and educational video.
    PictureTel's specialty is low-cost videoconferencing, and it has
repeatedly broken price barriers for entry-level offerings. When it
introduced its $40,000 system in January, comparable setups cost about
$100,000. Its recent under-$20,000 monochrome startup system comes in at
roughly $10,000 less than rivals. Its codecs only run to 768 kbit/s; they
do not handle full T1.
    VideoTelecom hopes to add value by tying PCs and LANs into the
videoconference. The company's approach has garnered some attention but
relatively small market share thus far, although there are signs this may
be changing.
    A relative newcomer to U.S. videoconferencing, BT North
America--part of the British telecommunications giant--hopes to capture
significant share with its VC2200 and VC2100 codecs. These products were
designed by BT, but until this summer were manufactured and sold in the
United States by GPT Video Systems (Stamford, Conn.) as the System 261. GPT
will continue to sell the units, but BT has decided it wants a share of the
profits. According to Max Arafa, marketing manager for videoconferencing at
BT, his company has 70 percent of the market in the U.K. and 50 percent of
the Western European market (including the U.K.). BT has announced that it
plans on capturing 30 percent of the U.S. market within two years.

VIDEOCONFERENCING: NOT JUST TALKING HEADS

By:
Johna Till Johnson, Data Communications

If videoconferencing conjures up the vision of CEOs and other captains of
industry communing electronically with their international counterparts,
it's time to hit the fast-forward. That may be an apt description of
''traditional'' videoconferences, but today's technology is far more than
talking heads.
    Users have gotten the message loud and clear: They're starting to
connect smaller sites and tie other companies into video networks. They're
also working with conferencing gear in unusual ways: Engineers design
systems, lawyers take depositions, and professors teach classes--all via
videoconferencing. And surgeons are even guided through operations under
the watchful eye of the camera.
    Is videoconferencing a technology whose time has come? Industry
analysts and video codec vendors point to a barrage of statistics to
bolster their claims: Over the past few years, the price of a
videoconferencing system has dropped from $250,000 to under $25,000.
Elaborate rooms dedicated to videoconferencing are being replaced by
rollabout systems that turn any office into a conference room. And with a
standard finished up last year by the International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee (CCITT) and now being implemented by codec vendors,
videoconferencing gear should soon be able to interoperate just like fax
machines or modems.
    Market forecasts are uniformly rosy. Forrester Research Inc.
(Cambridge, Mass.) predicts the market for videoconferencing equipment will
grow from a projected $120 million in 1991 to $239 million in 1995.
Herbert Maher, a senior vice president at the investment firm of Tucker
Anthony Inc. (Boston) sees equipment sales reaching as high as $300 million
in 1992, up from an estimated $185 million in 1991. Consulting and market
research firm Telemanagement Resources International Inc. (TRI, Lake Wylie,
S.C.) predicts worldwide annual revenues for videoconferencing equipment
and services growing from $510 million in 1991 to nearly $1.5 billion in
1995 (see Figure 1).
    ''I tell our clients, 'It's not a matter of if you will get
involved in videoconferencing, it's a matter of when,' '' says Ann Earon,
president of TRI. ''In fact, it's pretty safe to say that there aren't too
many industries out there that aren't doing something in video already.''
    But what makes 1991 or 1992 the year of the codec?
    Better equipment, for one thing: That means cheaper,
standards-based coder-decoders running compression algorithms with improved
voice and picture quality at lower speeds. Cheaper digital services from
network providers also are driving the market.
    To some extent, though, evolution has been the norm in
videoconferencing since 1981, when Compression Labs Inc. (CLI, San Jose,
Calif.) and NEC America Inc. (Herndon, Va.) were the only U.S. codec
vendors to speak of. Since then, the market has broadened to include such
players as Picturetel Corp. (Peabody, Mass.), VideoTelecom Corp. (Austin,
Texas), GPT Video Systems (Stamford, Conn.), and BT North America Inc.
(San Jose, Calif.)--all of whom offer codecs and conferencing systems in
the United States. Each has attempted to carve out a slightly different
niche, and individual codec designs reflect this.
    The top U.S. codec vendors are Compression Labs, PictureTel, and
VideoTelecom, in more or less that order (see table). In 1988, according to
Tucker Anthony, Compression Labs had the lion's share of the market,
selling 63 percent of all conferencing units. PictureTel followed, with 28
percent. The remainder was divided among the other companies. By 1992,
Tucker Anthony predicts that CLI's share will drop to 27 percent;
PictureTel's will hit 38 percent; and VideoTelecom's will climb to 15
percent (see ''Freeze Frame on Videoconferencing'').

STATE OF THE ART

    Compression is the sine qua non of videoconferencing; without
compressing the video images, conferencing would take up exorbitant amounts
of bandwidth. Until recently, all compression algorithms were proprietary,
which meant that codecs from different vendors couldn't work together. Last
December, however, the CCITT approved recommendation H.261, which defines a
video compression algorithm and a transmission mechanism for images at 64
kbit/s to 2 Mbit/s (see ''The Big Picture for H.261''). All major codec
vendors in the U.S. market either have implemented or will shortly
implement H.261-compatible algorithms. Many also still offer proprietary
algorithms.
    In essence, all compression schemes send an approximation of a
video image rather than the entire digitized image across the conferencing
link. And whenever possible, all transmit only those portions of an image
that have changed since the last frame rather than retransmitting the
entire frame each time.
    Thus, an algorithm's designers end up making fairly subjective
decisions about how best to approximate an image, and that can lead to a
fairly wide disparity in actual performance, even among algorithms based on
similar mathematical techniques. It's also why multiple algorithms are
available from most vendors.
    PictureTel, for example, offers SG3 (''second-generation 3''), SG2,
and H.261. SG3 is the most advanced, but software and sometimes firmware
upgrades are needed for older codecs. SG2 is offered for earlier PictureTel
codecs. Since putting multiple algorithms on a codec means adding software
or hardware or both, PictureTel offers one algorithm as standard and sells
the others as options (for $2,000 to $5,000 each). A typical customer might
purchase an SG3 codec and add H.261 to talk to units from other vendors.
    CLI supplies its Cosine Transform Extended (CTX) algorithm, Cosine
Transform Extended Plus (CTX Plus), and two versions of H.261 in four
packages for its Rembrandt codecs. The cheapest ($4,000) delivers CTX and a
lower-performance version of H.261. The $8,000 package adds a high-speed
version of the CCITT spec, and CTX Plus is added to the $12,000 package.
The final package includes four algorithms (both versions of H.261) plus
software for connecting to all other CLI codecs; it costs $21,500.
    Since vendors use different algorithms for their own products, how
do they ensure interoperability across their product lines? According to
Rich Baker, director of research for PictureTel, essentially the same way
that different-speed modems do. Once connected, two PictureTel codecs will
attempt to communicate using SG3. If that fails, they will drop down to
SG2, and finally to H.261.
    If that makes H.261 sound like the algorithm of last resort, that's
just how some in the industry see it. Robert F. Mitro, vice president of
sales and marketing at PictureTel, sees it as the the lowest common
denominator. ''We can get the same picture quality out of our proprietary
algorithm at 112 kbit/s as we do out of H.261 at 284 kbit/s.'' PictureTel's
Baker says the spec is primitive compared with PictureTel's own algorithms,
and John Walsh, senior vice president for planning and strategy at CLI,
calls it ''rudimentary connectivity.'' He also says H.261 lacks such key
elements as a low-bit-rate specification, encryption, and multipoint
communications.
    But BT sees it differently. ''We do not need a proprietary
algorithm,'' says Max Arafa, marketing manager for videoconferencing
products. ''We designed our product with H.261 in mind, and H.261 is
leading-edge stuff. Other vendors designed their products with H.261 as an
afterthought. Clearly they have optimized around proprietary algorithms.''
He accuses other vendors of promoting the idea that the standard is
insufficient in order to sell more of their own products.
    Users are equally split. Dan Gentile, telecommunications manager
for Maxtor Corp. (San Jose, Calif.) is evaluating videoconferencing systems
from CLI, PictureTel, VideoTelecom, and BT/GPT (products designed by BT and
manufactured by GPT are sold in the United States by both companies). In
his opinion, H.261 ''is very limited.'' But Ron Stevenson, program manager
for telecommunications at General Electric Co.'s Corporate Information
Technology (Fairfield, Conn.) has a different take: The vendors ''like the
fact that they have this embedded proprietary base, and they're going to
milk that to the end. Once it's all standards, it's all a commodity
market'' (see ''Lights, Camera, Action . . . Breaking Into
Videoconferencing'').
    Debate seems inescapable in a market where performance is so much a
matter of opinion. Although there are some objective criteria--frame
refresh rate, for instance--evaluating a codec tends to be more subjective
than, say, judging a T1 mux. Ultimately, there's really no substitute for
watching the picture through a range of motions and listening to the
sound.
    Resolution and motion are probably the best indicators of an
algorithm's abilities. PictureTel's Baker notes three key flaws affecting
video images: blocking, mosquitoes, and blurring.
    Blocking (or tiling) refers to images that resemble Impressionist
paintings: The image is present but fuzzy. Mosquitoes are tiny sparklike
points that form a shimmering halo (or aura) around a moving object or
person. Blurring describes a moving object that appears out of focus in the
area of motion.
    All three problems stem from the fact that compression algorithms
typically try to stuff a huge chunk of data through a narrow bandwidth pipe
by trading off resolution and smoothness of motion.
    In a codec, the analog video signal is sampled and converted into a
digital pattern that consists of 8-bit pixels. Each pixel describes either
the brightness or the color of a specific point. The Common Intermediate
Format (CIF) display specification, which is part of H.261, calls for
152,064 pixels per video frame, greater than 1.2 Mbits of data. Most codecs
transmit 15 to 30 frames a second. If those frames were uncompressed, it
could take nearly a T3 connection (45 Mbit/s) to transmit them. That's
where compression algorithms come in.
    Basically, compression algorithms attempt to hold down the number
of bits that must be sent per image. In effect, this is done by
transmitting only the ''important'' parts of an image and discarding the
rest.
    Most algorithms do so by using some variation of the discrete
cosine transform (DCT) to transpose the bit stream into the frequency
domain. (Frequency here refers to spatial, not temporal, frequency.) The
DCT of the image is run through a filter, which takes out the
high-frequency portions. (High-frequency, in this case, means those parts
of the image that are more or less uniform, say, those representing walls.)
The receiving codec performs the inverse of the transform and paints the
image on the screen.
    ''The object is to be able to represent the image in an accurate
way, even though you've thrown away 95 percent of it,'' explains
PictureTel's Baker. The transmitted information is thus not so much an
image per se, but instructions on how to reconstruct an image on the
receiving end of the transmission.
    The way a codec filters the signal affects the quality of the
image. If the filtering is not done well, viewers will see mosquitoes.
Blocking and blurring result more from the ongoing tug-of-war between
motion and resolution. A limited amount of bandwidth can be used either for
conveying information about motion or for image resolution, but not both.
    Blocking can be traced to initial division of the bit stream into
discrete blocks of pixels. With many algorithms, the processing is
performed block by block, rather than over the entire image. Typically, the
blocks are smoothed away by postprocessing at the receiving end, but if
there is a lot of motion, the algorithm won't have the bandwidth to modify
the blocks, and they'll appear on screen. With blurring, the codec lacks
the bandwidth to handle both resolution and motion: An object simply moves
too quickly to be captured with any degree of accuracy. The bandwidth is
devoted to capturing the motion, so resolution is sacrificed and the image
is blurred.
    Even when vendors agree on specific coding techniques (H.261, for
instance), codec performance can vary remarkably. The quality of the image
depends to a large degree on processing decisions (identifying the
''important'' part of any image or deciding how much bandwidth to devote to
smoothing).
    H.261, which is based on DCT, only specifies how the image is
decoded. It requires that codecs know how to conduct an inverse transform
and paint the image on screen; it does not specify how the image is to be
compressed. Hence, the diverse opinions about performance, particularly
when it comes to the CCITT spec. If a particular implementation of H.261 is
adept at reading the data and using the results, the picture will be
clearer and the motion smoother than another implementation's--yet both
will be able to interoperate.
TURN ON AND TUNE IN
    Another problem with judging performance is that many codecs may
appear to be ''tuned'' to particular data rates. In theory, the higher the
data rate the better the performance. In practice, this may not hold true.
Algorithms that deliver a certain quality at one speed may not do much
better at higher speeds. Similarly, codecs that perform well at high speeds
may look far worse at lower rates--much more than the drop in bandwidth can
account for.
    ''You should be able to have an algorithm that spans a wide range
of bit rates,'' says Baker. But given the complexity of the algorithms, it
makes sense for designers to try to optimize perceived performance at
particular speeds--usually those corresponding to such typical service
rates as 56 kbit/s, 112 kbit/s, 128 kbit/s, and so on.
    However, both the tuning and a viewer's response are subjective;
one vendor could choose to minimize certain features of an image at the
expense of others, making motion slightly smoother, say, at the cost of
greater blurring. A viewer who notices blurring more than smoothness might
find that ''tuning'' less desirable than other choices.
    Still, objective criteria exist. One of these is frame refresh
rate, the number of times a second that a receiving codec updates a picture
frame, which is basically a measure of the smoothness of motion. The North
American National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard specifies
roughly 30 frames per second for television broadcasts. The refresh rate
for codecs varies with the algorithm, data transmission rate, and motion in
a given image. (The more an object moves, the lower the frame refresh rate
will be.) CLI, often perceived as the Cadillac of codecs, tops out at 30
frames/s both with its CTX Plus algorithm and with H.261. That rate drops
to 15 frames/s for CTX. VideoTelecom achieves 30 frames/s with its Blue
Chip 30 algorithm and 10 to 15 frames/s with its other algorithms.
    A key point that tends to be overlooked, however, is that the
maximum frame rate is less critical than the minimum. An algorithm that
transmits 30 frames/s while displaying a blank wall but drops to 2 or 3
frames/s for a moving person is clearly not as good as one that maintains a
steady 10 frames/s.
    The catch is that vendors won't give their minimum frame refresh
rates, and for a perfectly valid reason: Frame rates decrease with the
amount of motion. A codec that maintains 5 to 10 frames/s during a
boardroom videoconference, for instance, might drop to 1 frame/s at a
basketball game. The best thing for net managers to do is compare codecs
displaying typical applications and attempt to push vendors on the issue of
minimum frame rates.

LET'S HEAR IT FOR...

    Another factor in the video quality equation is sound. True, the
image captures most of the initial attention in a videoconference, but
''The audio makes all the difference in the world,'' says William Ray,
director of communications network services for Corning Inc. (Corning,
N.Y.). Ray, who oversees a videoconferencing network with sites in the
United States and overseas, recounts an incident in which the audio wasn't
functioning properly. One potential user was unenthusiastic about the
equipment. Yet when the audio was corrected, the same user was impresssed
with the video quality. The picture quality hadn't changed at all, Ray
stresses, but the user's evaluation had improved enormously.
    Like images, sound is digitized and compressed by the codec.
Problems arise when the sound isn't synchronized perfectly with the picture
(someone appears to speak before his or her lips move, for instance) or
when the receiving codec doesn't cancel out echo.
    As with image transmission, these troubles are harder to overcome
at lower bandwidths because there are simply fewer bits to devote to a
solution. The bandwidth that's allocated to audio can range from 3.5 kbit/s
in very-low-bit-rate applications to 64 kbit/s in T1 video links. Most
vendors use adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) for audio
transmission, so effective audio frequencies range from 3.5 to 50 kHz.
    Videoconferencing echo is similar to echo in high-speed modems:
When a speaker at one end talks, the voice is transmitted across the link,
where it is heard at the other end. If the microphone at the other end
picks up that sound, it is retransmitted in an infinite loop, causing
feedback.
    Some of the ways that vendors try to eliminate echo involve keeping
volume down at the remote speakers, using directional microphones, and
employing elaborate switching mechanisms so that only the speaker's voice
is transmitted. Unfortunately, normal conversations are full of
interruptions, and speakers often get up and walk around the room. Thus,
vendors have developed echo cancellation algorithms--similar to those used
with V.32 modems but much more complex--that ''train'' the
videoconferencing units. In essence, the videoconferencing system measures
the acoustic characteristics of the conference room, taking what's known as
theimpulse response. (Depending on the algorithm, this impulse response can
be measured many times during the course of the conference.) Using this
information, the codec then subtracts the retransmitted echo from the
incoming voice signal. All in all, though, this is a very challenging
filtering process, and it rarely works perfectly.NEC, VideoTelecom, and
PictureTel all offer echo cancellation, but users seem to agree that the
PictureTel algorithm lives up to its sterling reputation. Corning's Ray,
for example, says PictureTel systems can be installed in virtually any room
without worrying about acoustics.

PICKING A CODEC

    Weighing all the performance issues to chose the right codec for
the job is probably the hardest part of designing a videoconferencing
system.
    As noted, users believe strongly that codecs vary in performance. But
performance alone should not be the only criterion: The amount of
bandwidth that must be allocated to achieve the desired picture quality
also is a factor. GE's Stevenson, for instance, says that his company
decided on the CLI product for most applications because of picture
quality, which he felt was more important (for most applications) than
bandwidth costs.
    GE's financial services division, however, chose PictureTel.
''Their needs are different,'' Stevenson says, explaining that financial
services tends to hold frequent, informal meetings, which makes the cost of
bandwidth more of an issue than picture quality. PictureTel delivers ''a
good picture at low bandwidth,'' Stevenson says.
    Finally, some users have specific requirements, such as the ability
to send and receive computer files and graphics during a videoconference.
Maxtor's Gentile, for instance, is intrigued by the fact that
VideoTelecom's MediaMax system will interface to his company's Ethernet LAN
to let him send engineering graphics. VideoTelecom is the only unit to date
with this ability.

THE REST OF THE SYSTEM

    Of course, a videoconferencing system includes more than just a
codec. Codec vendors and systems integrators also offer various cameras,
monitors, peripherals, and other options. From a network manager's
perspective, however, the most critical piece of equipment after the codec
is the access device. Codecs can work with switched and dedicated digital
links at bandwidths from 56 kbit/s to 1.544 Mbit/s, and they can connect to
these services in a variety of ways (see Figure 2).
    The plain-Jane approach is via a T1 CSU; this gives the codec
either the full T1 data rate or multiples of 64 kbit/s (depending on
service selected).
    Another option is to connect via a PBX. This makes sense when a
company has leased a T1 line to a site, for example, but will have some
channels free for low-bandwidth videoconferencing. Codec vendors often
have co-marketing agreements with PBX vendors. PictureTel, for example,
has agreements with AT&T for its Definity products and with Rolm and
Northern Telecom.
    With Switched 56 services, the codec generally connects through one
or two V.35 interfaces to a single or dual Switched 56 CSU/DSU. In some
cases, the CSU/DSU is integrated into the codec. PictureTel does this, as
does BT/GPT.
    Codec vendors also maintain lists of the products that will operate
with their equipment. CLI, for instance, will work with CSU/DSUs from ADC
Kentrox (Portland, Ore.), Digital Link Corp. (Sunnyvale, Calif.), and
Verilink Corp. (San Jose, Calif.).
    A final option for connecting to the network--one that's gaining
popularity--is through an inverse multiplexer. Although these units are
more expensive than CSU/DSUs, running $7,000 to $10,000 compared with
$2,000 or so, they make it possible to adjust bandwidth to the application.
A typical example of such a product is the Multiband bandwidth manager from
Ascend Communications Inc. (San Francisco).
    Ascend's Multiband combines multiple Switched 56 lines into a
high-bandwidth stream of up to 4 Mbit/s. This lets a company dial up only
the amount of bandwidth necessary for a particular call, allowing it to opt
for a low-bandwidth conference or a high-quality, 1.5-Mbit/s call. CLI is
planning to integrate its Multiband into its Rembrandt II/VP product line,
according to Ascend's co-founder Jay Duncanson. The company is planning
similar agreements with other codec makers.
    Multiband can connect to virtually any digital service, including
T1, Switched 56, and ISDN basic and primary rates. The flexibility of this
class of products, in fact, is a key reason for videoconferencing's growing
popularity. ''For the first time, videoconferencing is beginning to look
like standard telephone service,'' says Duncanson. ''You can procure a line
from a public carrier and pay only for service when you need it.'' Inverse
multiplexers also are offered by Teleos Communications Inc. (Eatontown,
N.J.), Newbridge Networks Inc. (Kanata, Ontario), and Digital Access Corp.
(Reston, Va.)
    PictureTel is taking a similar approach to digital services.
Although the company won't give specifics, the company's vice president of
sales and marketing, Robert Mitro, says it's planning to make its codecs
ISDN-capable.
    One part of the videoconferencing system that's often overlooked is
the multiport bridge. It's this gear that allows network managers to set up
multisite conferences; split-second switching is critical, since a bridge
must be able to switch among participants to keep the speaker's image on
screen. Instead of using bridges, it's possible to set up multiple
point-to-point links, but this gets expensive and cumbersome beyond
three-way conferences. Each site would need a codec, monitor, and comm link
for every other site.
    VideoTelecom, PictureTel, and CLI all make proprietary bridges.
Alternatively, net managers can use special bridging services from the
carriers, which have already purchased bridges and installed them at
central-office sites. Customers using digital services and codecs from the
same vendors as the bridges merely need to dial in to a specific number,
and the carrier will arrange the videoconference.

CHEAPER BY THE MINUTE

    The precipitous drop in price of videoconferencing equipment in
general and codecs in particular also has excited interest in this
technology. This year alone, the cost of an entry-level system hit two new
lows. In January, PictureTel introduced its System 4000 family, with a
starting price of $39,500; in July, it added two low-end models, the Model
20 and the Model 100, with a buy-in price of $19,900 for a monochrome unit.
Interestingly, even PictureTel admits to a degree of hype in all this
price-slashing: Mitro concedes that a true entry-level system--a bare-bones
system with a color monitor--starts at around $25,000. Still, that is a
sharp decline from the cost of a comparable system in 1988, which would
have run roughly $150,000.
    Why the drop? Codec vendors cite two reasons: first, technical
advances in the silicon. PictureTel and others who have been designing
their own chips have found they can consolidate functions of two or more
chips onto one piece of silicon, with a corresponding savings.
    Second, the law of supply and demand dictates that as
videoconferencing becomes more popular and vendors sell more products,
prices will come down.
    Equally important is the drop in the prices of network services.
''In 1987, the cost of a New York-to-California videoconference call was
maybe $150 an hour,'' says Mitro. Today that cost is under $20 an hour.
''Now it costs less than a call from a cellular car phone.''
    In that same period, the types of available services has grown
enormously. When videoconferencing made its debut as a business technology,
the only feasible way to link codecs was via a 1.544-Mbit/s dedicated line.
Now, in addition to dual 56-kbit/s links, carriers offer switched N56/64,
Switched 384, and switched T1, among others. And these services are getting
cheaper all the time.
    Bob McCarthy, product manager for AT&T Accunet switched digital
services, explains that the big change came in 1990, when the carriers
understood the need for usage-based prices for switched digital services.
Until then, he says, AT&T expected the primary application would be to back
up dedicated lines. But last year, it realized there were other
applications--including videoconferencing.
    As a result, AT&T cut its prices by about 75 percent, says
McCarthy, with a resultant surge in videoconferencing applications.
Corning's Ray says that his company installed its first pilot system last
summer, although he'd been following videoconferencing technology for five
years: ''By then, the price had come down until it looked affordable.''
    Despite the advances in network services, though, ''the big bugaboo
is still the network,'' says TRI president Ann Earon. Interoperability and
availability problems still remain. For instance, AT&T's switched digital
services won't work with those from US Sprint Communications Co. (Kansas
City, Mo.) or MCI Communications Corp. (Washington, D.C.).
    Interoperability is holding back one of the most potentially
explosive applications of videoconferencing, company-to-
company conferencing. While H.261 means that codecs can interoperate, a
codec on a digital service from, say, Sprint, won't talk to another unit on
an AT&T network except through a gateway, a custom-
designed bridging unit. Companies that want to videoconference with their
suppliers, customers, business partners, and anyone else have to make sure
that these groups are on the same network.
    In general, conferencing systems come in two distinct sizes: room or
boardroom systems, which are more or less permanently installed in a
dedicated conference room, and rollabouts, which can be moved from room to
room. So-called desktop systems are somewhere in between--small enough to
be moved from one room to another but not designed to be portable. Some
vendors offer a range of products: PictureTel, for instance, supplies six
models of its System 4000, and other codec vendors have followed suit.
    The difference betwen a boardroom system and a rollabout is
primarily packaging: The same codec can be installed in either. Most
vendors' systems are modular, peripherals like control panels and graphics
cameras and stands can be added as necessary.
    Most analysts believe that traditional boardroom videoconferencing
is on the wane. While conference rooms will never disappear, they say,
these systems will become less important over time, as users add smaller,
more flexible solutions. TRI predicts that while room models will capture
nearly half of the revenue in 1991 (41 percent), they will account for only
29 percent of the market by 1995. Desktop models, by contrast, will grow
from 8 percent in 1991 to 29 percent 1995. TRI also sees multipoint
conferencing as a small but growing segment of the market, moving from 1
percent in 1991 to 3 percent in 1995.

WHERE IT'S GOING

    What lies ahead? The crystal ball is, as always, cloudy, but some
trends stand out:
    For VideoTelecom, the integration of computer graphics and data is
already a reality. The company's Mediamax ''mediaconferencing'' system lets
users tie in LAN and PC data and graphics with more conventional audio and
video components. Because the system uses a PC-based architecture, it
connects as readily to a LAN as any PC. This sort of computer literacy is
not wasted on some users. Maxtor's Gentile points out that the ability to
exchange computer graphics would be very handy in engineering
applications.
    Other vendors agree that PC-based videoconferencing is the way to
go. PictureTel and Intel Corp. (Santa Clara, Calif.) have entered into an
agreement to develop multimedia technology for desktop applications.
    It's no news that the original picturephone flopped in 1964 and has
gone nowhere since. But CLI and AT&T have a joint venture to bring to
market a 19.2-kbit/s, full-color, full-motion videophone by 1992, and
others are likely to follow in their wake. PictureTel and BT/GPT have both
expressed interest in developing such a device. Hitachi recently displayed
a prototype ISDN-compatible unit that sells in Japan for 1 million yen
(about $7,000).
    In the end, the chances are very good that videoconferencing will
find its way to the desktop, whether inside a computer or added onto a
phone. More importantly, codecs will continue to get better and cheaper,
data services will proliferate, and standards will evolve to make products
truly interoperable. So get ready for videoconferencing. It'll be a fact of
life in the '90s.

Public ISDNs are starting to emerge as a practical way to link LANs in
Europe. But given serious equipment shortcomings and patchy service
availability, users are well advised to look before they leap

By:
Stephen Saunders and Elke Gronert, Data Communications International

In theory, Europe is just one PC card away from LAN interconnect via ISDN.
Commercial ISDNs are beginning to operate across the Continent, promising
to deliver users at last from notoriously high leased-line tariffs. ISDN's
long list of benefits seems too good to be true: It provides as much
bandwidth as digital leased lines. It's billed by the minute instead of the
month. Users get advanced features like the ability to call multiple
locations simultaneously. A one-minute transmission can be set up within a
couple of seconds between any pair of ISDN users. All that's been missing,
so the theory goes, is a card to connect LANs to ISDN. And now that such
cards are starting to appear, Europe should be ready to cross the threshold
into an era of faster, more efficient LAN connections over the wide area.
    In reality, though, users looking to connect LANs over ISDN today
face two major obstacles. First, only a handful of European countries have
full-scale commercial ISDNs, and coverage is patchy in some of those.
Second, most large vendors of bridges and routers--the key building blocks
of LAN interconnect--have yet to implement ISDN interfaces. Many other
vendors have brought out interim solutions, mainly in the form of PC-based
ISDN interface cards and software that perform bridging and routing. These
products range from low-end, manually operated devices to an IP router with
a throughput of 2.048 Mbit/s (see Table 1).
    These interim products are suitable only in certain applications.
The penalty for picking the wrong product could be a PTT bill so large it
makes users wonder why they bothered to switch to ISDN. But in the right
situation, an ISDN interface can save lots of money and even make possible
applications that previously were out of the question. If any one statement
can be applied to ISDN products thus far, it's that it pays for users to
shop carefully.

EQUIPMENT OBSTACLES

    The idea of ISDN for LAN interconnect is an appealing one: It
replaces slow analog dial-up lines and costly digital leased lines with a
fast, cost-efficient, ubiquitous service. All nodes on all LANs get two
64-kbit/s B channels, one 16-kbit/s D channel, and access to any other
node--a new concept for Europeans unfamiliar with switched digital
services. But a standard device that ties LANs to ISDN doesn't yet exist.
To date, the closest thing to it is a PC-based ISDN interface card and
bridging or routing software, used in conjunction with a standard LAN
interface card (see figure).
    Europe's low number of ISDN users and its patchwork of different
ISDN standards have discouraged bridge and router vendors from developing
integral ISDN interfaces for their equipment. ''Unless you target a
specific country, the market just isn't there,'' says David Bird, technical
support manager for the U.K. division of router maker Proteon Inc.
(Westborough, Mass.). Each national ISDN interface has to undergo lengthy
attachment approval tests, further discouraging vendors, says Nigel Oakley,
product marketing manager for U.K. operations of 3Com Corp. (Santa Clara,
Calif.). Still, some bridge and router vendors are developing ISDN
interfaces. Retix (Santa Monica, Calif.), for example, says it will add a
64-kbit/s ISDN interface to its bridges by mid-1992 for unspecified
countries.
    Using a terminal adapter to connect existing routers or bridges to
an ISDN has some serious shortcomings, despite what vendors may claim. The
problems arise from ISDN's use of a separate D channel to carry the signals
that set up and tear down calls, identify the type of traffic on the B
channels, and invoke other services such as calling-line identification. In
a normal bridge or router, that information is carried on the same channel
as the data; terminal adapters cannot separate and convert it for use on
ISDN D channels. As a result, the terminal adapters will pass traffic from
routers and bridges to ISDN B channels but they cannot set up and tear down
calls automatically--often a vital feature for minimizing line costs.
    IBM acknowledges that the inability of its terminal adapter, the
7820, to automatically control ISDN lines is a drawback, but it says it's
addressing the problem, as are other vendors. Terminal adapters that
present an X.21 or V.24 interface can be configured to automatically dial a
preset number and thus set up an ISDN B channel call when requested by the
attached equipment. Cisco Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.) uses this
facility in Version 8.3 of its firmware so that its routers can invoke an
ISDN backup when the existing trunk fails or becomes congested.

INTEGRATED INTERFACES

    While bridge and router vendors are hanging fire on integrating
ISDN interfaces in their products, major computer makers such as Digital
Equipment Corp. (Maynard, Mass.) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (Palo Alto,
Calif.) are launching ISDN interface cards that connect LANs to other LANs,
hosts, or standalone PCs. Many smaller vendors also have developed packages
for PCs and Apple Macintoshes comprising ISDN cards and bridging or routing
software.
    Of the products shown in Table 1, most are PC cards. They can be
managed with the PC's monitor and keyboard, and the PC's hard disk can be
used to store configuration data. The disadvantage is PCs are not designed
specifically as bridges or routers and thus provide much lower performance
than specialized devices.
    Some features of sophisticated bridges, such as filtering of
broadcast packets, are likely to be rudimentary in PC-based bridges.
PC-based routers will likely do a better job than PC-based bridges in
filtering out unwanted packets before transmission over ISDN. It's worth
checking whether products support the full complement of router functions,
such as multihop routing and intelligent load balancing. Some vendors, such
as MBP Kommunikationssysteme GmbH (Dortmund, Germany), have incorporated
support for Novell's Internet Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol in their
products to ensure full router functionality across an ISDN.
    Some vendors interviewed for this article were unable to say if
their products were bridges or routers, or what protocols their products
would support. For this reason, users are well advised to borrow products
for evaluation before buying them. After installation, it's also advisable
to monitor PTT bills, if possible on a daily basis, to check whether the
ISDN is carrying packets that should have been filtered out.

LINE CONTROL

    Automatic line control offers another way to minimize PTT bills.
Usually implemented in software, line control lets users adjust their
equipment so that calls can be extended to match the billing increments set
by PTTs. The length of these increments varies; it can be as little as 18
seconds on many long-distance routes to as long as six minutes for local
calls in Germany. ''You can program our device to hold the call until just
before that time, and then drop it,'' says Stefan Gieseler, manager of
product marketing for communication systems at MBP. As increment length
rises, so does the ''free'' time available to users. At the same time, line
control helps users cut down on billing for unused connection time.
    Automatic re-establishment of failed ISDN calls is a feature worth
paying for. It would have paid dividends for the Department of Computer
Science at University College London, where ISDN connections were dropped
every 10 minutes by a bug in an ISDN switch from British Telecommunications
PLC (BT, London). Using information available on the ISDN D channel, the
university's failed calls could have been re-established automatically.
    With automation, however, comes the need for network management.
Like other services, ISDNs must be monitored so that alerts can be
triggered when problems arise. Without alerts, network managers may
unwittingly invoke backup lines (and rack up usage charges) while failed
lines lie idle and unreported to the PTT.
    A few vendors, such as Hewlett-Packard and Bintec Computersysteme GmbH
(Nuremberg, Germany), incorporate support for the industry-standard simple
network management protocol (SNMP) in their products. Other vendors, such
as OST S.A. (Cesson-Sevigne, France) and Teli AB (Nynashamn, Sweden),
provide local proprietary management. Digital Equipment Corp. provides
local or remote proprietary management.  But some vendors don't provide
any method of managing their products, either locally or remotely; these
include Industrade AG (Wallisellen, Switzerland) and Stollmann GmbH
(Hamburg, Germany).

MANY CARDS, MANY CALLS

    Most ISDN cards support simultaneous calls over both B channels of a
basic-rate interface (BRI), and some products accept multiple cards in the
same chassis, enabling communications with several destinations at once.
For example, up to three DEC ISDNcontroller 100 cards can be fitted into
the Q-bus of DEC's MicroVAX computers. When loaded with DEC's VAX ISDN
Access Software, the MicroVAX acts as an ISDN Ethernet server, allowing
data from LAN-attached nodes, including non-bus computers, to be routed
over an ISDN to nodes on remote LANs also equipped with the card. With
three cards loaded, the server simultaneously can exchange data with six
sites at 64 kbit/s per connection. Multiple ISDN cards can be installed in
PCs as well as minicomputers. Up to four of MBP's cards supporting NetWare
routing functions can be combined to support eight simultaneous calls. Up
to eight of OST's IP router cards canbe installed in the same PC to
support 16 simultaneous 64-kbit/s calls.
    Some vendors add another degree of sophistication by synchronizing
calls to the same location so that higher bandwidths can be supported.
Industrade offers an IP router similar to OST's, but its product can
combine any two channels for total throughput of 128 kbit/s. In
Hewlett-Packard's ISDN Server, up to six B channels can be combined to
deliver throughput of 384 kbit/s.

BIGGER BANDWIDTHS

    Bintec recently took the concept of multiple cards and channel
synchronization a step further with the introduction of its ISI/Gate IP
router, which can provide aggregate bandwidths as high as 2.048 Mbit/s--the
same as an E1 leased line. The router has slots for 16 ISDN cards (from
other vendors as well as Bintec) in an AT bus. Each ISDN card can be
connected directly to a BRI socket or to a PBX connected to an ISDN.
    ''We tested all the available solutions on the market, and ISI/Gate
is the only one which can be expanded to support 32 B channels,'' says
Andreas Merkel, a member of the data processing center's networking group
at the University of Konstanz (Germany).
    Bintec also is the only vendor to have implemented data compression
in its product. Usually, protocol overhead can cut actual throughput to
rates as low as 40 kbit/s on each 64-kbit/s channel, but Bintec's device
uses an algorithm called Van Jacobson Compression to reduce TCP/IP protocol
overhead from 40 bytes to just 5 bytes per packet. With compression turned
on, data throughput of 62 kbit/s can be achieved on each B channel,
according to Merkel. ''Without the compression this throughput wouldn't
have been possible,'' he says. Another vendor, Dataflex Design Ltd.
(London), is working on a way to incorporate the CCITT's V.42bis error
correction and data compression algorithm in its terminal adapter. Dataflex
says it will ship a product by the end of the year.
    The ISI/Gate also supports communications with any other ISDN location
as wellas simultaneous communications at lower speeds with multiple sites,
neither of which would be possible with a normal router attached to an E1
line. A primary-rate version of the ISI/Gate will be available in
mid-1992, says the vendor.
    Only one vendor--Gandalf Data Ltd. (Nepean, Canada)--already
supports LAN interconnection over a primary-rate interface (PRI, which in
Europe combines 30 B channels). Gandalf's ISDN Primary Rate Subsystem fits
inside its Starmaster multiprotocol communications server. The Starmaster
links IEEE 802.3 Ethernets and routes TCP/IP and DEC's Local Area Transport
(LAT) protocols. Like the Bintec product, Gandalf's offering can
synchronize all its channels to deliver the maximum throughput of 1.92
Mbit/s.
    Gandalf's Subsystem can connect the Starmaster to ISDN PBXs from
Northern Telecom (Mississauga, Canada), AT&T (New York), BT, Siemens AG
(Munich), and GEC Plessey Telecommunications PLC (GPT, Coventry, U.K.),
enabling Starmaster-attached devices to share ISDN bandwidth with
PBX-attached voice lines.
    An early user of the Gandalf switch, the Department of Computer
Science at University College London, says the switch adds five seconds to
call set-up times. In experiments with BT's ISDN, calls took seven seconds
to set up when routed through the switch and only one or two seconds when
routed through other equipment.

WHEN ISDN PAYS

    But even the most advanced ISDN gear is only as good as the service
it's connected to. However appealing the prospect of ISDN for LAN
interconnect may seem, users should examine availability and tariffing
issues before rushing out to buy the latest in ISDN interfaces. The
economic argument for or against LAN interconnect via ISDN varies according
to the type of traffic being supported, the distance between sites, and the
country. As is the case with the interface equipment, users need to
consider their needs carefully before committing to a service.
    ISDN is best suited for relatively large file transfers because its
64-kbit/s B channels are circuit switched and because usage charges are
based on ordinary telephone tariffs, which usually have a minimum duration
of at least one minute. In theory, a 480-kbyte file--relatively large by
most standards--can be transferred across a 64-kbit/s link in one minute.
    An unidentified car maker in Europe already is using ISDN to ship
CAD files to its component suppliers, according to Sun Microsystems Inc.
(Mountain View, Calif.). The files are generated on Sun workstations and
shipped via networks of PC-based bridges and routers. ''ISDN is absolutely
strategic to this company,'' says Jean-Pierre Baudouin, head of Sun's
International Center for Network Computing (Grenoble, France), which is
charged with developing ISDN interfaces for Sun workstations.
    There are other applications, such as those involving interactive
traffic, where ISDN may not be economical for LAN interconnect. When
interactive traffic is carried via ISDN B channels, users pay for bandwidth
whether they use it or not, since a link must be kept active to handle
whatever traffic is generated. In this case, packet-switched services may
be more economical. Some of the LAN interconnect services based on frame
relay, itself an outgrowth of ISDN, might offer another alternative when
(and if) they become widely available in Europe.
    ISDN's feasibility vis-a-vis leased lines depends on the distance
between sites and on the country (or countries) where the sites are
located. In short, ISDN is most cost-effective when linking LANs across
borders at 64 kbit/s, according to the consultancy Logica Cambridge Ltd.
(London). In Belgium, for example, a 64-kbit/s leased line would be more
cost-effective than ISDN only if users required more than 230 minutes a
day of connect time (see Table 2). In Germany, where leased-line tariffs
are among the highest in Europe, users would need 450 minutes of daily
connect time to justify a 64-kbit/s cross-border leased line. Even in the
case of BT, which nearly doubles its charges for international data calls
over ISDN, the break-even point for leased lines is 158 minutes per day.
    Within countries, however, it's a mixed picture. ISDN is a
nonstarter as an alternative to leased lines within the U.K. But in
Belgium, primary-rate (1.92-Mbit/s) ISDN compares much more favorably with
leased lines than a single B channel, particularly for local links. At
present, it pays to use primary-rate ISDN rather than a 1.92-Mbit/s leased
line in Germany if daily usage totals less than 90 minutes. However,
drastic cuts are planned in German leased-line tariffs that might upset
these calculations.
    Where tariffs are similar, of course, ISDN is a much better
alternative to digital leased lines. Unlike leased lines, ISDN enables
users to connect with any other user of switched digital services--an
advantage that will snowball as ISDN's coverage increases, national ISDNs
are interconnected, and the number of ISDN users increases.

PATCHY COVERAGE

    At present, ISDN in Europe is characterized by limited
availability, few users, and plans for rapid expansion by 1994. Those are
the conclusions of a recent study prepared for the Commission of the
European Communities by two consultants, Ovum Ltd. (London) and
Fischer & Lorenz (Copenhagen, Denmark). The study, titled ''European ISDN
Atlas, 1991,'' shows where ISDN is available and when it will reach other
locations in the European Community. ISDN installation plans are given for
all European Community countries, as are the years when ISDN will be
commercially available in each major city.
    Only four European countries--Belgium, France, Germany, and the
U.K.--had commercial ISDNs on January 1, 1991, according to the study. At
that time, the number of installed basic-rate ISDN lines totaled a mere
14,665, compared with 100,000 in the U.S. and 20,000 in Japan. Europe had a
total of 2,865 primary-rate lines, compared with 500 in the U.S. and 500 in
Japan.
    Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (Bonn, Germany) gives higher figures
than those in the study, but its numbers are for ISDN lines ordered, not
lines installed. The difference in statistics does show that Germany is
investing heavily in ISDN, as are some other European PTTs.
    In fact, the PTTs are closer to offering comprehensive coverage
than U.S. carriers, according to one of the study's authors, Ovum's Stephen
Timms. France Telecom already claims to offer national coverage for its
ISDN, Numeris, although it acknowledges that users might have to wait six
months for an ISDN line in some locations.
    By January 1, 1994, the deadline set by PTTs for the delivery of
commercial ISDNs based on common European standards, PTTs are promising
ISDN in 100 percent of business locations in Belgium, Denmark, France, and
the U.K. Standardized service, sometimes called ''Euro-
ISDN,'' will be available in 80 percent to 99 percent of business locations
in Germany and Portugal, 60 percent to 79 percent of those in the
Netherlands and Ireland, and 40 percent to 59 percent of those in Italy and
Spain, according to the study.

MULTIVENDOR NETS
MADE EASY

Putting together a multivendor network is difficult enough, but to those
charged with explaining each vendor's systems and network architectures the
job can seem just about impossible. In A Manager's Guide to Multivendor
Networks, John Enck maps out an approach that's comprehensive enough for
training executives and technical staff alike. The book not only defines
the networking architectures of four key vendors--IBM, Digital Equipment
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., and Sun Microsystems Inc.--but also notes the
similarities and differences among them.
    Enck also explores the ties that bind together multivendor nets,
including standards, messaging services, and network management systems.
Most major U.S. and European standards are covered, as are the OSI
seven-layer reference model and the Government OSI Profile (GOSIP)
standard. Enck examines the major components of wide-area services,
including X.25 networks and X.400 electronic mail, and offers a guide to
troubleshooting problems on LANs and WANs. The book costs $35.

A COMMON MOTIF

Motif, the graphical user interface for X-Windows, goes Microsoft Windows
one better: Unlike the popular PC operating environment, the Open Software
Foundation's Motif is platform-independent. Indeed, the X-Windows system
itself already has been implemented on networks made up of Unix, VAX, DOS,
and Apple Macintosh systems. With Motif Programming Manual by Dan Heller as
a guide, users can write a single, consistent, intuitive interface for all
their applications.
    Heller, the creator of Z-Mail, a widely used electronic-mail
package, introduces the Motif tool kit and supplies definitions of all
classes of Motif objects. In addition to explaining the Motif programming
model, Heller discusses the basics of user interface design. Each of the
main elements of the Motif library is examined in its own chapter. The
manual assumes some familiarity with the C programming language, although
Heller notes in his preface that ''even those who dabble in C can
understand the concepts well enough to do most things.'' Motif Programming
Manual costs $34.95.

IBM'S SYSTEM VIEW: ADDING FUNCTION TO FORM
A year after its unveiling, IBM's grand scheme for total systems
management is still in its formative stage

In product announcements and statements of direction issued over the past
year, IBM has gone to great lengths to tell the world that SystemView is a
cornerstone of its master information technology plan for the 1990s and
beyond. Yet more than a year after SystemView's unveiling, its composition
and implications remain a mystery.
    IBM itself is largely to blame for much of the confusion
surrounding SystemView. In many of its statements, the vendor has implied
very strongly that SystemView is a real architecture, albeit one that has
yet to be released formally. The reality, however, is that SystemView is
not an architecture but a strategy that to this point lacks a tangible
foundation.
    SystemView's charter is ambitious: to provide a total systems
management framework for enterprises with information processing systems
that are built on a diverse collection of computing and communications
platforms. SystemView encompasses not only the hardware but also the
applications and the operational procedures required to run a distributed
computing environment from the largest IBM and non-IBM systems down to
individual desktop workstations.
    SystemView's breadth and scope are daunting enough to give pause
even to staunch IBM supporters. Yet many corporate networkers now are
counting on IBM to deliver on its lofty promises. More thana third of the
nearly 460 network management professionals who responded to a May 1991
survey by the Datapro Information Services Group (Delran, N.J.) said they
would choose SystemView as their open systems management model--ahead of
such high-profile solutions as OSI and TCP/IP with its simple network
management protocol (SNMP). No doubt that percentage will climb as IBM's
plans begin to take shape with real products.
    If SystemView lives up to all of IBM's advance billing, few users
are likely to be disappointed. In IBM's scheme, SystemView will serve as a
framework that will enable most, if not all, of the diverse management
activities of running a computer system to be integrated and, where
possible, automated. It will go beyond ''technical'' issues to address
other management tasks integral to the operation of any system, such as
financial administration, service-level tracking, capacity planning, and
even business planning.
    IBM is counting on SystemView to help it maintain its leadership
role in defining the direction that information technology will take. IBM
has prided itself on being able to develop proprietary architectures that
become industry standards with tremendous staying power--witness the
System/370 and SNA. IBM's latest architectural foray, Systems Application
Architecture (SAA), has not been a resounding success to date, but IBM
seems intent on boosting SAA into its systems pantheon. In its September
1990 unveiling of SystemView, IBM went to great lengths to make one point
very clear: SystemView is an integral part of SAA.
    Ideally, IBM would have waited until SystemView's underlying
architecture was intact--or at least clearly defined--before announcing it.
But pressure from other vendors, most notably Digital Equipment Corp.,
forced IBM to take the wraps off its strategy. DEC announced its total
systems management plan, Enterprise Management Architecture (EMA), in 1989,
a year before IBM gave any inkling of SystemView.
    Although the September 1990 introduction of SystemView and a
smattering of ''conformant'' products seemed rushed, it did manage to
swing the momentum in the systems management race in IBM's favor. With one
bold and blustering move, IBM managed to take the high ground and redefine
the expectations for the range of management functions needed for computer
environments in the coming years. In the process, IBM also raised the ante
in the high-stakes battle for the multivendor, open systems network
management arena.
    IBM upped that ante a little more this past September, when it
announced several more SystemView developments, including an expanded list
of ''SystemView-conformant'' products from IBM and third-party partners and
a set of criteria for gauging product conformance to SystemView. Although
IBM did not unveil its formal blueprint for SystemView--Systems Management
Architecture (SMA)--in its September 1991 announcements, as it was expected
to do, that introduction should take place within the next year.
    The September 1990 and 1991 announcements don't come close to
revealing the entire SystemView scheme, but they do offer some solid clues
about where IBM expects to take systems management in general--and network
management in particular--in the coming years. How well IBM succeeds in
leading computer and communications technology into the next century
remains to be seen; but the effect that those efforts will have on
corporate information networks will be profound.

BLURRING LINES

    The need for a management architecture that cuts across vendor
lines and embraces as many facets of systems management as possible is
driven by one undeniable fact: The distinctions between computers,
networks, and applications are blurring to the point of irrelevance.
Management responsibilities are widening within specific disciplines as
well. For instance, systems managers can no longer focus solely on
predicting, isolating, tracking, and resolving network problems; they must
also tackle such ''nontechnical'' issues as performance (response-time and
service-level) tracking, capacity planning, asset management, and
configuration management.
    Despite criticism to the contrary, IBM has not been a laggard in
the management arena. It started to embed integrated management features
into SNA as far back as 1977. In that pre-PC era, failures and errors in
large-system communications hardware and in communications links were the
biggest problems for network managers. For that reason, IBM focused on
developing management facilities for monitoring and controlling hardware
rather than applications.
    This original bias toward hardware is evident to this day. Over the
last few years, however, IBM has made a concerted effort to swing its
emphasis to the application side. NetView, introduced in 1986, is part of
IBM's push to expand network management beyond hardware. NetView is now the
predominant network management system for System/370 SNA networks.
    IBM's efforts in the 1980s to move beyond hardware management were
not limited to NetView. IBM brought together all of SNA's management
facilities in 1986, in a standalone, subordinate architecture known as
SNA/Management Services (SNA/MS). Still, IBM's aspirations for management
far exceed what is available with NetView today or even postulated in the
latest revision of SNA/MS.

GRAND ENTRANCE

    Enter SystemView. IBM introduced its systems management vision in a
massive September 1990 coming-out party that featured nearly 150 products
relating to the launching of the System/390 range of computers. The
SystemView announcement was a daring, and probably premature, move by IBM
to articulate its long-term objectives for multivendor systems management.
    In the SystemView introduction, IBM revealed a number of long-term
systems management goals, including the following: Improvements in the
usability of its systems management control programs; Consistent
definitions of resources to be managed; Consistent access to, and
management of, resource definition data; Compliance with open systems
standards, such as the International Organization for Standardization's
(ISO's) common management information services (CMIS) and common
management information protocol (CMIP) standards; Automation of management
tasks whenever appropriate; Provision of management application program
interfaces (APIs) to ensure customer and third-party participation and
integration; Provision of relevant support applications, such as SAA Asset
Manager/MVS, one of the few SystemView applications to be released by IBM.
    All these objectives are similar to, and no doubt inspired by, the
goals that IBM spelled out for SAA back in 1987.
    This past September, a year after SystemView's introduction, IBM
kept the ball rolling with another high-profile announcement, introducing
more SystemView products and its lineup of SystemView product development
partners (see Table 1). It also released a preliminary draft of SystemView
conformance guidelines (see Table 2).

WAITING FOR AN ARCHITECTURE

    Of course, before SystemView can become a reality, it needs an
actual foundation. SystemView's architecture, known in IBM circles as the
Systems Management Architecture, was supposed to have been delivered by
now; its debut has been pushed back to 1992. The delay is troublesome but
understandable given the scope of IBM's undertaking.
    When it is completed, SMA--and thus SystemView--will enable SAA,
AIX (IBM's Unix), DOS/VSE, and other IBM hosts, as well as non-IBM systems,
to be configured, controlled, and monitored across SNA, OSI, and TCP/IP
networks (see Figure 1).
    The September 1991 SystemView announcements included two
developments with important ramifications for network managers. One is
IBM's implicit integration of NetView into the SystemView framework. The
other is management support for heterogeneous LANs.
    Enhancements to NetView Version 2, such as S/390 Automation
Services and extended graphical capabilities announced in September, now
carry the SystemView imprimatur. The NetViewinfusion adds immediate
credibility to SystemView. It also means that users won't have to worry
about backing the wrong management horse.
    NetView already addresses some of SystemView's basic objectives,
although with an emphasis on network management. These include problem
management, response time monitoring, inventory tracking, and software
distribution. NetView also has rudimentary compatibility with SNMP, the
open network management standard for TCP/IP networks.
    NetView should provide a useful nucleus around which to expand
SystemView--at least for the time being. At some point, however, NetView,
with its heavy SNA orientation, will have to undergo some fundamental
changes to conform with all SystemView goals.
    IBM ultimately may decide to phase out its NetView products and
replace them with more robust SystemView counterparts. Although it debuted
in 1986, NetView evolved from a series of vintage 1970s network management
products, such as Network Communications Control Facility (NCCF), Network
Problem Determination Application (NPDA), and Network Logical Data Manager
(NLDM). The overlap between some ''value-added'' SystemView and NetView
offerings, such as the SAA Delivery Manager and the NetView Delivery
Manager, suggests that IBM may be thinking about replacing its NetView
offerings with SystemView equivalents.
    Beyond NetView, network management support for heterogeneous LANs
comes in the latest release of Advanced Communications Function/Virtual
Telecommunications Access Method (ACF/VTAM). Version 3, Release 4 of
ACF/VTAM, through the 3172 Interconnect Controller, now accommodates SNA
traffic over Token-Ring, Token-Bus, fiber distributed data interface
(FDDI), and carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection
(CSMA/CD) LANs alongside TCP/IP traffic. This support, which incorporates
the 3172's fiber optic Enterprise System Connection (Escon) channel
connection, allows ACF/VTAM hosts to interact with LANs up to 5.6 miles
away at up to 10 Mbyte/s, the direct channel rate.
    The SNA and TCP/IP support, coupled with the OSI support that IBM
plans to offer via OSI/Communications Subsystem (OSI/CS), elevates IBM to
being a prime, if not the only, vendor that can offer a heterogeneous
communications system comprising LANs, WANs, integrated SNA, TCP/IP, and
OSI. With ACF/VTAM 3.4, its other communications subsystem software, and
existing NetView technology, IBM at least has the makings of the
communications infrastructure it will need to realize at least the SNA,
TCP/IP, and OSI network management aspects of SystemView.
    IBM's protocol repertoire should expand even further next month,
assuming the introduction of its first multiprotocol router comes off as
planned. The router, which will be based on IBM's RS/6000 workstation, is
likely to accommodate such non-IBM LAN protocols as Novell Inc.'s Internet
Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX), DECnet, and
AppleTalk.

SYSTEMVIEW'S THREE DIMENSIONS

    In its SystemView outlines to date, IBM has defined its management
strategy in terms of three interrelated elements that it calls dimensions:
the end-use dimension, the application dimension, and the data dimension
(see Figure 2). These three dimensions are analogous to SAA's Common User
Access (CUA), Common Programming Interface, and Common Communications
Support components. Like SAA's components, SystemView's three dimensions
will provide relevant guidelines, standards, architectures, and application
program interfaces (APIs) for integrating systems management applications.
    The end-use dimension will set the criteria for providing
workstation users with a consistent and uncomplicated view of SystemView
applications. It will define the guidelines for a common interface to be
used by all systems management applications. The criteria defined in this
dimension will ensure that SystemView meets its improved usability
objective. The end-use dimension is oriented toward iconic, object-based,
point-and-click technology. It is based on an SAA CUA interface that will
be implemented on programmable workstations (IBM PS/2s).
    It now appears that the SystemView end-use dimension will be
implemented on top of IBM's OS/2-based GraphicsView/2 product, which was
announced in September 1990 and is slated to be released by the end of
this year. GraphicsView/2 facilitates the display of system and network
configurations using color-coded status designations. The Graphic Monitor
Facility of NetView Version 2, Release 1, though not based on
GraphicsView/2, offers a relatively faithful preview of what will be
available with GraphicsView/2.
    SystemView's application dimension will set the criteria for
implementing and integrating systems management applications. It will
specify the services and interfaces needed to control, coordinate, and
operate heterogeneous, enterprise-wide information systems. This dimension
has six distinct disciplines: business management, change management,
configuration management, operations management, performance management,
and problem management. IBM has said it will define the application
dimension criteria in such a way as to promote the implementation of
systems management applications to address the various disciplines that
will cross operating system and network boundaries.
    The data dimension will define the requirements for the consistent
definition of resources and the consistent access to such data. To do so,
it will rely on a data model that will use the SAA Database Access
Interface, a Structured Query Language (SQL) interface. The model will be
compatible with the ISO's 10165-4 guidelines for the definition of managed
objects and the 10165-1 management information model.

THE FASTSERVICE FACTOR

    One IBM offering that is emerging as an important component of
SystemView is the Failure Analysis and Support Technology Service, or
FASTService. Introduced in August 1990, FASTService comprises
methodologies, software, hardware, and dedicated customer support--complete
with a toll-free phone line--aimed at finding and resolving as quickly as
possible software problems that arise in S/390 MVS applications.
    FASTService is an innovative and practical offering that in a sense
characterizes the leading-edge, total spectrum management philosophy
embodied in SystemView. It offers facilities to ''trap'' problems the
instant they occur; automatically log problems with a unique identifier to
a user-specified database; produce customized storage dumps; automatically
notify a remote support group; and automatically search a database for
possible resolutions to the problem.
    FASTService is based on the use of IBM-supplied ''software
probes.'' Application developers insert these probes--
which are in the form of S/370 Assembler, Cobol, or PL/1 macros--at
critical points within the application. A probe is triggered whenever it is
encountered in the execution path of the application; thus, probes are
inserted in error or unexpected paths within the application. When
triggered, the software code associated with the probe performs a set of
services specified for that probe. These services can include the
generation of a code dump, the issuance of a NetView alert, or the
invocation of a search process to determine if a resolution has already
been posted for the problem associated with that probe. The benefits of
such automated technology are so compelling that IBM itself intends to use
it in its future strategic products.
    FASTService has yet to be used widely and is now available as a
service within the United States only. It also is fairly expensive right
now. But it does offer the very tangible benefit of significantly reducing
the time and effort needed to debug and maintain large applications,
thereby saving many days, or even months, of programming labor.

THE CURRENT LINEUP

    According to IBM, only two IBM SystemView products are now
available: Workstation Data Save Facility/VM and NetView Graphic Monitor
Facility. About a baker's dozen more IBM products carry the inscrutable
label ''SystemView Conformance Announced.''
    Workstation Data Save Facility/VM is a remote backup application
based on the client-server model. It permits workstations running under
DOS, OS/2, or AIX to back up data on a central S/3X0 host running under VM.
The idea of using host computers as hyper file servers for data backup,
archiving, and retrieval is a sound one. For more than three decades, users
have been backing up and archiving S/3X0 host data, in some cases nightly.
Hence, there's a wealth of proven products, tools, procedures, policies,
and trained personnel in place to perform this crucial function on a
regular basis.
    The NetView Graphic Monitor Facility (NGMF) is an intrinsic feature
of NetView 2.1. It offers the graphical user interface of OS/2 Extended
Edition 1.2, with color-coded status messages. NGMF also provides
multilevel or hierarchical views of the complete network. A ''zoom-in''
feature gives the network operator an expanded view of either a portion of
the network or of individual components, such as Network Control Program
(NCP) Type 4 nodes or peripheral node physical units.
    This past September, IBM enhanced NGMF to include multivendor
support through what appears to be an ASCII emulation facility. NGMF now
addresses two key objectives of SystemView: Its user interface is compliant
with SystemView's end-use dimension, and it handles multivendor systems.
    Among the products labeled as ''SystemView Conformance Announced,''
the SAA Delivery Manager (DM) originally was hailed as a quintessential
SystemView product. SAA DM is a centralized software, document, and file
distribution service for networked OS/2 workstations. Its functions are
somewhat analogous to those of NetView DM, which offers delivery services
to PCs, AS/400s, S/36s processors, and VM hosts, among other IBM systems.
    The differences between SAA DM and NetView DM are intriguing. SAA
DM offers software license management and virus detection software
integration, workstation-oriented features that NetView DM now lacks. But
NetView DM works with a wider range of devices, including just about all
the strategic SAA remote platforms, while SAA DM works only with OS/2
workstations. All things considered, NetView DM appears to be the stronger
of the two products.
    IBM has acknowledged the overlap between SAA DM and NetView DM.
However, it has not specified any guidelines as to which product is more
strategic, or when to use one as opposed to the other. But most of IBM's
key SAA software development partners already have pledged their support to
SAA DM.
    SAA Asset Manager (AM) appears to be an initial implementation of
the business management discipline in SystemView's application dimension.
It provides an open database definition scheme that can be used to collect
data about all of an enterprise's resources in a central repository, as
well as a centralized, automated inventory management service for hardware,
software, and other resources.
    There is an obvious and acute need for such asset control in
distributed environments. However, just as with SAA DM, the announcement of
SAA AM begs a coexistence question. For the past two years, IBM has been
creating an asset tracking service, albeit for hardware only, for NetView
through its Network Asset Management facility. In this case, however, IBM
appears to have spotted the potential overlap between the SAA and NetView
offerings. Just before SAA AM was scheduled to ship, IBM pushed back the
release date of the product because of ''customer feedback.''
    On the positive side, SAA AM--when it becomes available--will
handle inventory management for any software distributed via SAA DM. This
is a clear signal that IBM is serious about tightly integrating all
SystemView applications.
    Both SAA DM and SAA AM rely on a new MVS and VM host-based product
called SAA Application Connection Services (AConnS). AConnS extends the
OS/2 EE Desktop Manager, icon, and resource manipulation environment to
embrace mainframe applications andresources. It lets users of OS/2
workstations directly invoke host applications and gives them direct access
to host-attached advanced function printers. With AConnS, an OS/2 user can
execute multiple applications concurrently, on separate windows. Such
applications can be any combination of local PS/2 applications, Logical
Unit 6.2 (SAA) cooperative processing applications, or 3270-based
(LU-to-LU) applications.

IBM PULLS SAA
OUT OF THE MIRE

By:
Anura Guruge, BBN Communications

There sure were times when IBM appeared unsure as to exactly what it wanted
to achieve with SAA, its proposed model for next-generation client-server
computing. But IBM never lost sight of the fact that both it and its
customers were in dire need of such a model.
    That's why Big Blue never seriously contemplated ditching SAA, as
so many industry analysts predicted. In fact, Big Blue has continually, if
not diligently, striven to strengthen SAA's technical infrastructure and
bolster its credibility. Its September 11 product blowout (over 100
products and services) is certainly in that tradition: 40 percent of that
blockbuster revolved around SAA. (The SystemView announcement is discussed
in detail on page 99.)
    From its 1987 inception, SAA had the basic framework and the right
repertoire of services to be a solid architectural platform for developing
IBM-centric applications. What got it into trouble was IBM's initial
preoccupation with promoting it as the means of attaining that holy grail
of contemporary computing: cross-platform application portability. Given
that the standard execution environment needed to achieve this portability
is only now beginning to appear, IBM's preemptive posturing left it with
lots of egg on its face. The embarrassing slips in the availability of
OfficeVision Version 2, dubbed the first SAA application, did nothing to
bolster SAA's credibility.
    Much to its credit, IBM has been successful in pulling SAA out of
the mire. The aforementioned September 11 extravaganza did a great deal to
dispel lingering doubts and reassert SAA's strategic significance. The
message is clear: SAA is here to stay and is set to follow in the
illustrious footsteps of SNA and the S/370 Principles of Operation.
    The three overriding precepts of the new SAA, which I've taken to
calling SAA Mark II, are client-server, workstation-host cooperative
processing; unrestricted transparent access to widely dispersed data; and
total system management of heterogeneous environments.
    This trio is key to realizing the workstation-based integrated
LAN/WAN computing model advocated by IBM and others. The entire
paradigm--from the design of the iconic user interfaces to the mechanisms
that permit consistent, reversible updates of multiple distributed
databases--is now synthesized, articulated, and implemented within the
context of SAA.
    The availability of SAA's Common Programming Interface for
Communications (CPI-C) across all six SAA platforms (MVS, VM, OS/400, OS/2,
CICS, and IMS) is a big step. At long last, a standard interprogram
communications service with the same API can be found on multiple
platforms.
    In parallel, major strides have been made in harnessing the
capabilities of the pivotal Distributed Relational Database Architecture
(DRDA), which has been part of SAA since 1988. DRDA specifies the protocols
with which a single transaction can access or update multiple, distributed,
remote databases. It also supplies fail-safe mechanisms to ensure the
integrity of all databases in the event that a transaction needs to be
rolled back.
    With the widespread use of DRDA and its file-oriented counterpart,
Distributed Data Management (DDM), it is possible to see a decline in the
indiscriminate file transfers routinely performed in IBM environments. But
the real problem associated with moving data, ignoring the vast amounts of
network and disk capacity consumed, is the loss of data synchronization and
security.
    DRDA makes it possible to access and update a single copy of any given
database in situ, irrespective of location or dispersion. Performance,
relative to local access, is the one drawback. The move toward networks
based on high-speed LANs interconnected by bridges and routers and the
steady decline in the cost of high-capacity WAN bandwidth, however, should
minimize this.
    A limited DRDA capability was announced on IBM's DB2 and VM SQL/DS
in September 1990, enabling a transaction to freely access multiple
databases but only update one. This September, a similar facility was
offered for the OS/2 Database Manager. Now an OS/2 user can access or
update relational databases on MVS, VM, and OS/400 hosts, treating those
databases as if they were local. While the exact future of OS/2 is murky,
it remains a major platform, and the DRDA facility gives it a compelling,
competitive edge.
    The Information Warehouse (IW), also announced in September, goes
even further in extending DRDA to non-IBM databases. Platform-independent
database manipulation is obviously of strategic interest to the large
number of IBM customers who are locked into IBM long-
term but starting to experiment with distributed databases available on
Unix open systems. IW, at least in theory, permits all such databases to be
transparently integrated.
    IW narrows the gap between SAA and Network Application Support
(NAS) from Digital Equipment Corp. (Maynard, Mass.). A few years ago, NAS
and SAA, despite their obvious parallels, could not be accurately compared.
SAA was restricted to IBM platforms and appeared to be very
application-centric, while NAS was network-centric and geared to
integrating applications and data resident on diverse platforms on a DEC
server.
    With IW and its various interoperability ''viaducts'' (IBM lingo
for gateways) to Unix/AIX systems, SAA is slowly but surely attempting to
become more oriented toward open systems. There have been many hints from
IBM over the past couple of years that it intends to draw SAA and AIX even
closer together, cross-pollinating the two technologies. The inclusion of
the Open System Foundations's Unix-based Distributed Computing Environment
(DCE) within SAA is evidence of this move. It hasn't happened yet, but it
can't be too far away. The result would be SAA Mark III--an ''open'' SAA
that could stretch across SAA and Unix platforms.
    IW also furnishes more evidence of SAA's newfound respectability.
The hype that has accompanied earlier SAA adjuncts has been conspicuously
absent. This is a far cry from the IBM once determined to gain a clear
market lead, the one that charged ahead with the aggressive promotion of
SAA concepts and products with scant attention to maturity or
availability.
    In each case, this shoot-from-the-hip approach did more damage than
good. At least with IW it appears that the lessons learned so far are being
put into practice.
    All in all, SAA has come a long way in its four and a half years.
At a comparable age, SNA was just getting around to supporting its first
multihost networks. That was 13 years ago.
    Instead of writing off SAA, we'd be better off taking a closer
look--and the September 11 announcements are a good place to start. And
since I was responsible for dismissing SAA as the Hubble Telescope of the
computer industry, it's only appropriate that I take the lead in admitting
that where SAA is concerned, IBM has regained its focus.

START YOUR ENGINES FOR IMPROVED SNA PERFORMANCE

By:
Joe Mohen, Contributing Editor

In the racing pits of Indianapolis, a crew can change four tires, pump 40
gallons of fuel, and add an aerodynamic spoiler in nine seconds flat. Each
crew prides itself on the tricks it develops to squeeze the most work into
the least time. There's even a contest among pit crews, separate from the
car races, to determine who's fastest.
    Networking professionals are no different: They, too, devote
endless hours to shaving a second here or there off procedures like file
transfers. There aren't any formal competitions, but maybe there should be:
One of the most frequently traveled pathways, the SNA micro-to-
mainframe link, continues to be dogged by sluggish performance.
Off-the-shelf products can help turbocharge throughput, but the lesson
we've learned here at Team Mohen is that there's no link that wouldn't
benefit from some fine-tuning.
    Five years ago, most of us were happy just to be able to download
host files to our PCs, regardless of how long it took. Today it's a
different story. It's not uncommon for companies to quit using first-
generation micro-to-mainframe products because of their poor file transfer
rates. In one extreme case, a large U.S. bank went back to mailing floppy
disks because it took such a ridiculously long time to download
spreadsheets via modem.
    Another company, a large proxy house, had a production application
that required it to download an entire DB2 database, several gigabytes
long, to a file server every night. The only problem was that each
''nightly'' download took 27 hours! Obviously, that kind of rate is
unacceptable.
    The file transfer products in use at that time achieved throughputs
of only around 8 kbit/s. That's excruciatingly slow, considering that
thetoken ring adapter cards in the user's 3174 communications controllers
were running at 4 Mbit/s. Put another way, an average file transfer ran at
1/500th of the network data rate.

A TUNE-UP GOES A LONG WAY

    This user realized dramatic improvements in throughput by following
a few simple steps. The first thing was to correct the things that were
radically wrong with the environment:
Not using LU 6.2 for SNA batch transmissions. The protocol used by 3270
terminals, Logical Unit Type 2 (LU 2), is the worst possible choice for
file transfer. LU 2 limits message size--and thus the amount of information
it can transfer at a time--to one screen (usually 1,920 bytes). Sending
larger records means sending multiple messages. Worse, LU 2 requires the
receiving PC to acknowledge each message by emulating an ENTER keystroke
each time a screen is sent. Moreover, 3270 terminals cannot receive certain
binary strings, which means additional superfluous information has to be
sent to achieve data transparency. All in all, LU 2 imposes far too much
overhead for file transfers.
    Switching to the LU 6.2 protocol allowed messages of up to 32
kbytes to be sent without restriction. This alone quadrupled the
throughput.
Not using large token ring frame sizes. On this user's local token rings,
it took almost as much time to send a small message as it did a large one.
That's because the user had set a 265-byte maximum on each message, or
''frame'' as it's called at the data link level. We increased the frame
size to 1,929 bytes, and here the payoff was really impressive: Typically,
throughputs showed fourfold or fivefold increases. Over the wide area, the
improvement is more modest (usually it's in the 15 percent range), but it's
an improvement all the same. (Newer token ring boards now have enough
memory to support frames as large as 4 kbytes.)
Not using a fast processor. The speed of the local computer can be a major
factor in determining micro-to-mainframe throughput. If you want fast
transmissions, don't even think of using an 8088 or 80286.
Not using segmenting. Unlike the OSI model, which guarantees transparency
by isolating each of the seven layers from one another, IBM's SNA mixes
control information from three high-level layers into a single message
called a Request Unit (RU). In the vast world of IBM connectivity, the size
of the RU is the single most important parameter when it comes to
fine-tuning a link.
    As a rule, it pays to make the RU larger than the frame size. This
forces the RU messages to be broken into multiple frames in a process
called ''segmenting'' that boosts throughput. For this user--
and, in fact, for every other installation I've seen--segmenting produced a
50 percent boost in throughput on a LAN link and a 15 percent improvement
across an SDLC connection. Segmenting remains one of the best-kept secrets
of link tuning.
    When we were finished at this site, we got the user's transmission
time down from 27 hours to less than one hour. Effective throughput was
approximately 360 kbit/s--and that was without segmenting. When we employed
segmenting, throughput rose above the 500-kbit/s mark. The
micro-to-mainframe speeds that you're getting today are probably less than
a quarter of that.
    That's not to say there isn't any room left for improvement. Since
then, we've boosted throughput on 4-Mbit/s token ring LANs to more than 1
Mbit/s by using the very fast 3174-11 controller. This device is three
times faster than its predecessor, the 3174-011.
    Some of the things that seemingly would speed throughput can
actually slow it down. A good example is adaptive data compression. When
used with a slow processor, adaptive compression algorithms consume so many
processing cycles that throughput can actually decline, even though there's
less data to send. This problem isn't limited to low-end 8088 and 80286
machines; I've also found it to be true of certain minis, such as IBM's
System 36 and DEC's MicroVAX.
    I'm not suggesting by any meansthat compression should always be
turned off. But it does play an important role in throughput, and network
managers should check to see how it affects throughput before they set it
and forget it.

DO TRY THIS AT HOME

    Before fine-tuning your own token ring environment, first try to
determine what your optimum throughput can be. Right now, I believe the
optimum throughput using 3174 4-Mbit/s Token Ring Interface Controller is
about 1 Mbit/s, as described earlier. For a 3745 4-Mbit/s controller, the
upper limit is faster than 1 Mbit/s. In either event, you'll probably need
LU 6.2 to achieve these numbers.
    So should you run out and buy a 3745 to replace your 3174? Not
necessarily. The 3172 token ring interface is faster than either. And since
the 3172 can handle OSI and TCP as well as SNA, there's no longer a good
reason to buy those older alternatives. The embarrassing thing about the
3172 is that it's basically a $35,000 PS/2. McData Corp. (Broomfield,
Colo.) offers a strong alternative to the 3172 with prices in the low 20s.
    In the not-too-distant future, I believe throughput will approach
wire speeds. An IBM lab already has achieved rates of better than 3.8
Mbit/s on a 4-Mbit/s token ring using Network Services/2. And within five
years, we're likely to see wire speeds on 16-Mbit/s token ring LANs. Until
we see that checkered flag, though, there's still plenty of fine-
tuning to be done.

SURVEY METHODOLOGY

The DATA COMM User Survey on SNMP multivendor network management systems
comprised a two-page questionnaire and incentive mailed to a random sample
of 2,500 subscribers on July 8, 1991. Results are based on 175 valid
responses. The questionnaire listed 25 products from 24 vendors, with space
left for write-in mentions.
    Users were asked to rank their SNMP systems in order of importance
in their networks, number 1 being most important. Only products that were
ranked first or second in importance by more than 15 respondents were
included in the final tabulations. The ''Other'' category comprises
write-in candidates only; it does not include systems that drew fewer than
15 responses as the first or second most important products. Users then
were asked to rate their two most important SNMP systems in 14 technology
categories and in five service categories. The following scale was used: 5
= Excellent; 4 = Very Good; 3 = Good; 2 = Fair; and 1 = Poor. Users also
were asked to select a ratio that best described how they valued technology
versus service. They also were asked to describe the size of their
networks, the way they were using SNMP systems to manage network devices,
and the importance they would place on SNMP in managing their networks.
    Mean scores were calculated for each question by multiplying the
frequency of each rating by its value and dividing the result by the total
number of questions in either the technology or service categories. The
mean scores in both categories were then weighted according to the mean
percentage of importance given by the respondents--70 percent for
technology, and 30 percent for service. Winners in each category were
chosen after the weighted scores in both categories were averaged.
    Twenty products did not garner enough responses to be included in
the final tabulations. These were: the ACS 4800 from Advanced Computer
Communications (Santa Barbara, Calif.); the NetCentral Station from Cisco
Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.); the ExpressView system from David
Systems Inc. (Sunnyvale, Calif.); the Eye*Node from Digital Analysis Corp.
(Reston, Va.); the DECmcc Management Station for Ultrix from Digital
Equipment Corp. (Maynard, Mass.); the MONET system, formerly the HLS 9100,
from Hughes LAN Systems (Mountain View, Calif.); the Lance Network
Management System now offered by Micro Technology Inc.'s Lexcel subsidiary
(Fullerton, Calif.); the NCRNet Manager, provided on a request basis by
AT&T (New York) and formerly sold by NCR Corp. (Dayton, Ohio); the
DualManager from Netlabs Inc. (Los Angeles); the Series 5000 from Network
Equipment Technologies Inc. (NET, Redwood City, Calif.); the OverView
system from Proteon Inc. (Westborough, Mass.); the LANcentral Express from
Racal-InterLan (now Racal-Datacom Inc., Sunrise, Fla.); the MultiMan system
from RAD Network Devices Inc. (RND, Huntington Beach, Calif.); the 5025
Network Management Center from Retix (Santa Monica, Calif.); the LattisNet
Network Management System from SynOptics Communications Inc. (Santa Clara,
Calif.); the TIME/LAN 100 Element Management System from Timeplex Inc.
(Woodcliff Lake, N.J.); the NetDirector from Ungermann-Bass Inc. (Santa
Clara, Calif.); the WANmanager from Vitalink Communications Corp. (Fremont,
Calif.); the Wellfleet SNMP-NMS from Wellfleet Communications Inc.
(Bedford, Mass.); and the Management Station from The Wollongong Group Inc.
(Palo Alto, Calif.).

THE BENEFITS--AND DRAWBACKS--
OF GROWING YOUR OWN

Since SNMP's introduction in 1988, information about the protocol has been
readily available to Internet users, and the source code has been offered
from vendors such as Performance Systems International Inc. (PSI, Reston,
Va.). Armed with this code, users can design and build their own SNMP
management systems--and according to the DATA COMM User Survey, that's
exactly what some respondents have done. Since most commercial SNMP systems
are just barely out of the gate, homegrown systems have been an attractive
alternative in these early days of SNMP.
    ''We just didn't find exactly what we wanted in commercial systems
when we looked at them last year,'' says Ron M. Hoffmann, assistant network
manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, Mass.).
Hoffmann says his group found products that looked like they'd perform well
in smaller networks, but not in a setup the size of MIT's. That network
comprises more than 4,000 Ethernet nodes attached to a fiber distributed
data interface (FDDI) backbone and segmented by Cisco routers.
    The MIT group used software from NYSERNet Inc. (Syracuse, N.Y.) to
construct Unix-based SNMP tools that perform a number of functions, among
them turning specific nodes on and off and gathering information from
routers and repeaters in the network.
    The difficulty of constructing an SNMP management system from
scratch may be one reason why the customized systems didn't fare as well in
the overall ratings as the commercial systems did. In ease of
customization, however, the Other group ranked fourth with a score of 3.30,
after Hewlett-Packard, DEC, and Novell, and before Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Cabletron Systems Inc. The obvious conclusion: If you develop your own
software, it's easier to modify it.--M.J.

USERS RATE SNMP MULTIVENDOR NETWORK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
In a new market, users are still
figuring out what SNMP management
can do for them

By:
Mary Jander, Data Communications

Vendors of network management systems may proclaim this the Age of SNMP
Management Over Every Last Device on Earth, but according to the DATA COMM
User Survey of SNMP multivendor management systems, that just isn't the
case--at least not yet.
    To be sure, network managers would love to control many different
devices, from many different vendors, with a single, easy-
to-use system. Survey respondents believe simple network management
protocol systems will bring that dream closer to reality. They're quick to
add, however, that the systems are simply too new and their experience with
them too limited for anyone to declare that SNMP management of multivendor
networks is an essential, or even widely accepted, part of networking.
    Many readers are still in the process of evaluating one or more
systems on isolated network segments. Indeed, almost half of the 320
readers who responded to the DATA COMM survey haven't even gotten to the
testing stage yet, although most say they plan to use SNMP systems in the
future.
    One reason for users' general lack of experience with SNMP systems
is that these systems are relatively new: Novell Inc.'s LANtern Services
Manager shipped in March 1991; DEC's DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module
became available in November 1990; Cabletron Systems Inc.'s Remote
LANview/Windows was first equipped with SNMP management capabilities in
July 1990, although it debuted in September 1989; HP's Network Node Manager
shipped in May 1990; and Sun Microsystems Inc.'s SunNet Manager shipped in
March 1990, making this 21-month-old program the most venerable in the
field.
    Even the simple network management protocol itself is fairly new.
Devised in 1988 by Internet scientists to manage devices in TCP/IP
networks, SNMP has not been extended far beyond its original charter.
Several Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) groups are working on
extensions that will allow SNMP to manage more types of devices, but it
will take time for these improvements to filter down to users.
    While many survey respondents had yet to make a final commitment to
a single SNMP system, they did seem pleased with the current crop of
products. The five systems that made the final tabulation rarely rated
below a score of Good, and no system ranked less than Fair in any category.
Because the scores were so close, and because many of the systems were
still being evaluated, DATA COMM selected just one
winner--Hewlett-Packard's OpenView Network Node Manager.
    HP's product fared well in both technology and service ratings,
achieving the highest overall score and the top ranking in the technology
categories. Notably, the Network Node Manager scored solid ratings where
other systems stumbled, particularly in categories such as management
information base (MIB) extensibility and utilities, a key area for
multivendor network management. HP's product also did well in degree of
automation, availability and quality of user-defined reporting facilities,
emergency support, and application development and systems integration
services.
    Digital Equipment Corp.'s DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module
garnered the second-highest overall score. It had the top ratings in the
service categories, leading all other vendors in documentation, maintenance
and repair, and training.
    DEC's solid service record was unusual: The other systems included
in the ratings did better in technology than in service. Scores were
highest in the technology categories of ease of use, ease of installation,
and overall system performance (see Table 1).

TIES THAT BIND

    Despite the newness of the systems, the survey did reveal some
clear patterns among users of SNMP systems:
Many users acquired their systems mainly because they already had equipment
from the system vendor--Cabletron hubs, for instance, or Novell LANs--
even though all the systems surveyed are billed as multivendor managers.
Most were looking at other products too, and many were investigating the
possibilities of altering or customizing their existing systems with the
help of vendors or consultants.
Users haven't yet harnessed the full power of their management systems.
Many survey respondents said they rely on their systems only to report
trouble, even though the systems also perform trend analysis and active
monitoring. When the network is running smoothly, many respondents simply
ignore their SNMP systems. Part of the blame for users' lack of awareness
rests with the vendors, which according to users could do a better job of
bringing them up to speed on their technology.
Workstations and PCs are by far the most common type of device managed,
according to nearly four-fifths of survey respondents (see Table 2). The
second most widely managed class of devices is LAN servers, by 59.22
percent of users.
Besides the users who were still testing their systems, many said they are
undecided or ambivalent about keeping their SNMP management systems
permanently.
SNMP is gaining the most ground in small networks and in portions of larger
ones. Users are trying out SNMP systems in departments or selected LAN
segments before adopting them throughout their enterprises.
    Fully 68 percent of users surveyed said they were using SNMP
systems to manage less than 10 sites. Another 9.7 percent are using SNMP to
manage from 11 to 20 sites, and only 8 percent are using SNMP to manage
more than 21 sites. The mean of all responses was just 10.1 sites.
    The number of devices managed at these sites is also small. Nearly
half of all respondents, 48.6 percent, said they manage less than 50
devices with an SNMP system. Less than a quarter of respondents, 22.3
percent, manage 50 to 100 devices with an SNMP system; 15.4 percent manage
100 to 500 devices, 7.4 percent manage 500 to 1,000 devices, and just 4.0
percent said they manage more than 1,000 devices. The mean number of
devices managed is 185.1.
Network management of all types--not just SNMP--accounts for a relatively
small part of the typical communications budget. Survey respondents said
only 32.1 percent of their budgets goes toward network management, with 12
percent of this devoted to salaries for network management personnel, 11.6
percent allocated to the management systems themselves, and 8.5 percent
assigned to management services, including outsourcing.

THE DAWN OF MULTIVENDOR SUPPORT

    Support of multiple vendors' internetworking gear is still a
relatively new feature, and one that few survey respondents had explored at
any great length.
    Until this spring, all of the products listed were capable of
supporting only basic SNMP alarm information from nonproprietary gear.
Although most vendors could and would add support for other vendors' MIBs
on a custom basis, most systems only understand MIB I, the set of general
definitions that describe a device's functions to an SNMP system.
    That began changing this year, when vendors started adding MIB
compilers that can accept and manage a range of devices from multiple
vendors. SunNet Manager Release 1.1, which shipped in February, includes a
translation utility that allows users to compile other vendors' MIBs,
including those that include proprietary extensions. Version 2.0 of
Hewlett-Packard's OpenView Network Node Manager, which shipped last spring,
adds a MIB compiler to the system's Application Builder software. The
software accepts any MIB and loads it automatically into the HP system's
graphical user interface.
    DEC's DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module currently accepts only
basic alarm and status information from network devices that support MIB I.
DEC says it will offer a MIB compiler with the second release of the SNMP
Access Module, slated to ship by the end of the year. This new release also
will support MIB II and will come with several proprietary MIBs already
incorporated into the system. MIB II supports more types of devices than
MIB I does--most notably T1 transmission devices and a range of LAN media
types--and it provides more extensive management control.
    Novell's LANtern Services Manager also displays only basic alarm
information from non-Novell devices that support MIB I. The LANtern
Services Manager is an interface for Novell's LANtern monitoring device
that oversees one Ethernet segment at a time. The LANtern can send its
information to a range of other SNMP-based systems, including the
Hewlett-Packard and Sun systems. There have been rumors that Novell will
soon offer a MIB compiler for use with the LANtern Services Manager, but
Novell won't confirm this.

SEND HELP

    Users have mixed feelings about how well vendors are helping them
meet specific network management requirements. Most respondents said they
are interested in modifying their SNMP systems to manage more types of
devices, run on a different platform, or perform capabilities generally not
offered by their SNMP system out of the box. These comments send a clear
message to vendors: Send more, and better, help.
    Hewlett-Packard, DEC, and Novell products received relatively good
marks for ease of customization, but all vendors' scores dropped for
database capabilities, availability and quality of user-defined reporting
facilities, and MIB extensibility and utilities. A notable exception was
Hewlett-Packard's score of 3.69 for MIB extensibility and utilities.
    In some instances, users said they'd asked for hands-on assistance
in modifying their systems--a need that was not always met. ''Cabletron
could give us better service in showing us how to adjust the system,'' says
William Vilwock, computer specialist at the U.S. Bureau of Mines field
office in Spokane, Wash. Vilwock's group is using Cabletron's Remote
LANview/Windows on a 114-node Ethernet that comprises local and remote
sites. The group needs to extend the network to incorporate non-Cabletron
WAN equipment, and Vilwock say it's been slow going.
    A user of the Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager also
said he'd like more support. ''HP hasn't been here in over a year,'' said
this technician, who requested anonymity and whose group is using
Hewlett-Packard's product to monitor a 400-node Ethernet network. ''The
Network Node Manager is a reasonably good product that covers the basics
and provides diagnostics. But the graphics aren't that customizable, and
we'd like to add more graphical features.''
    In contrast, another user said Hewlett-Packard was extremely
helpful in showing his organization how to create Unix-based applications
that allow the HP OpenView Network Node Manager to respond to network
problems. ''On a Unix workstation, I can easily program a routine that
activates a beeping pager if something goes wrong,'' says Randy J. Miller,
systems support analyst at Union Carbide Coatings Service Inc.
(Indianapolis). Miller describes his installation as ''an HP shop from way
back.''
    Another user reported that his vendor, DEC, was taking more time
than he'd like in considering changes that he had requested. Dave Dorosz,
systems engineer at Phillips Laboratories (Hanscom Air Force Base, Bedford,
Mass.), is using DEC's DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module to manage a lab
network containing 10 bridged Ethernet segments comprising DEC bridges and
routers and computers from several vendors. He said his group is satisfied
with the system, but would like more capabilities, including an automatic
node discovery tool--software that is capable of locating and graphically
depicting devices with IP addresses in a network. The group also wants to
monitor network traffic across bridges through the Access Module, instead
of using a separate dedicated DEC LANbridge to collect network traffic
statistics for the DECmcc Director system. The group also would like to
runthe DECmcc Director system and its access modules on a Sun workstation.
    The Phillips Labs group is evaluating a range of other SNMP
systems, not because DEC hasn't been helpful, but because it's simply
taking too long for DEC to decide about adding these functions to its
system, Dorosz says.
    Users clearly want vendors to help them expand their systems, and
many are ready to go elsewhere if they can't get what they need from one
system. In fact, most users contacted were evaluating more than one system
or were thinking about doing so. Some users are willing to create their own
systems to get what they need (see ''The Benefits--and Drawbacks--of
Growing Your Own'').

SERVICE WOES

    As noted, the SNMP systems included in the final tabulation scored
worse in service than in technology categories. The lone exception was the
DECmcc Director SNMP Access Module, the only product to post higher overall
scores for service than for technology. Users' satisfaction with DEC's
service is reflected in first-place ratings for overall service, training,
vendor documentation, and maintenance and repair. One user complimented DEC
on its commitment to service and commented that ''a DEC representative
camps out in our data center when something goes wrong.''
    Hewlett-Packard also did comparatively well in the service
categories, although its showing was not as strong as in the technology
ratings. Hewlett-Packard's OpenView Network Node Manager scored first in
the emergency support category and in application development and systems
integration, and it placed second to DEC in overall service and in
maintenance and repair.
    In follow-up interviews, users' service complaints included gripes
that vendors had sold them a system and then deserted them, relied too much
on third-party support, or provided introductory training and then failed
to deliver adequate help in a pinch.
    Emergency support scores were lower than anywhere else in the
survey ratings, and Novell users were especially vocal. Unlike the other
four vendors, who rely on telephone service or sales reps to perform
maintenance and repairs, Novell relies on third-party consultants, who
charge what they want to for service. Novell maintains a hot-line service,
but if users can't get a problem fixed on the hot-
line, they must rely on these third-party representatives to get the job
done. Some users are unhappy with this setup because it puts them at the
mercy of local services--and the high prices they typically charge.
    One LAN administrator complained that even if she calls the Novell
representative in her area and talks for only 10 minutes, she still must
pay a $75 hourly fee. When trouble hit, it was expensive. ''Novell is great
on training and provides hot-line service for their products, but when our
Novell system needed work, we had to hire the $75-an-hour consultant Novell
assigned to us,'' this user says. The consultant's bill, added to the cost
of network downtime, made this particular repair job an unpleasant
experience.
    Vendor documentation was another weak spot. H.L. Wilson,
information systems manager at the U.S. Naval Air Station (Pensacola, Fla.)
and a user of Novell's LANtern Services Manager, says that documentation
from Novell and other vendors is better than it used to be but not as good
as it should be. ''Sometimes I get instructions that don't match the
version of software I'm using, but seem to have been written before it was
enhanced,'' Wilson says.

FIRST AND LAST

    The highest score in the survey went to Hewlett-Packard: 3.89 for
ease of use. The lowest score in the survey was Cabletron's 2.69 rating for
the service category of application development and systems integration.
    The Cabletron ratings were the most uneven in the survey. They
ranged from a first-place score of 3.83 for ease of installation and a
second-place score of 3.83 for ease of use--two of the highest scores in
the findings--to last-place ratings for ease of customization, degree of
automation, security, and application development.
    Cabletron's latest SNMP system, Spectrum, wasn't listed in the DATA
COMM survey form because it just began shipping when the survey was
conducted and consequently hadn't had time to build up a substantial
installed base (see ''Survey Methodology''). Cabletron says Spectrum does
address the very areas where users felt Remote LANview/Windows is weak.
Application development and systems integration are key functions of
Spectrum, and the vendor already has ported the system to a range of Unix
platforms.
    In fairness, the ease-of-use rating turned out to be uniformly high
for all of the vendors, and the category for application development and
systems integration was similarly low for all.

Best Overall
HP OpenView
Network Node Manager

Top scores in far more categories than any other product gave
Hewlett-Packard the top honors in this DATA COMM User Survey. Introduced in
May 1990, HP's network manager is among the oldest products surveyed and
now is in its second release. It runs on HP workstations under HP/UX and on
Sun Sparcstations under SunOS. HP's software finished first in nine out of
14 technology categories and shared first place with Sun's SunNet Manager
for best graphical user interface. Users particularly liked the product's
MIB extensibility and utilities, which enable them to manage other vendors'
devices.

BILLING FOR LAN INTERNETS:
WHO PICKS UP THE TAB?

By:
Robin Layland, Travelers Insurance Co.

Ah, the joys of internetworking: Now that LANs are no longer strictly local
affairs, it's up to the corporate telecom department to decide who foots
the bill for all that connectivity. But when corporate starts asking
questions about utilization, it's funny how every department or workgroup
suddenly seems to be a ''below average'' user. And they want their bills to
reflect that.
    Strange how the same folks usually seem to be demanding more
bandwidth.
    Since all the parties on the network agree that someone else is
using the network more than them, a simple approach would be to charge
everyone the same amount. This one-bill-fits-all tack is a surefire way to
get everyone equally upset, but it's not going to accomplish much else.
    On SNA installations, bills are tallied using data collected by
performance-monitoring tools such as IBM's NetView Performance Monitor
(NPM). When all those below-average users complain about their charges,
you show them the hard data on utilization.
    But LAN internetworking isn't SNA networking. IBM's NPM doesn't
gather the needed information on network usage, which brings us full
circle: How are internetworking bills to be generated? How do you prove
that some of those below-average users are really above average?
    Obviously, what's needed is a billing data collection system for
internets. But don't run out to your internetwork equipment vendor (whether
it specializes in bridges, routers, or analyzers) and expect to find one.
Even Nick Lippis doesn't have one.
    While it may sound logical for bridge or router vendors to supply
the gear needed to collect billing data, they don't see it that way. In
fact, most don't seem to consider billing an important issue.
    Some router vendors may try to convince you to use their product's
TCP/IP accounting feature, which keeps track of TCP/IP addresses. That's
fine if everyone is using TCP/IP (they aren't) or if a TCP/IP subnet is
directly equal to one billing group. In most cases, though, the subnet is
shared by many departments, and they don't want to see their bills
combined.
    You could solve the problem by adapting something on the market
(like a LAN analyzer) and writing your own billing application. Of course,
you'd probably have to deploy one of these devices on every LAN, which adds
up to more work and expense than most corporate telecom departments want to
get involved in.
    But imagine just for a moment that we've actually convinced
internetworking vendors to solve the billing problem. Before they deliver
the solution, they're going to ask some questions of their own, starting
with: ''What type of billing system do you want?''
    A usage-based system sounds like a good answer, but it's not that
simple.
    There are two basic models for usage-based billing in a LAN internet.
The first is very similar to the way the local telephone company generally
bills its users. There's a set fee that permits an unlimited number of
local calls and a usage-sensitive (and distance-sensitive) charge for
long-distance calls. On an internet, this approach would translate into an
unlimited number of packets within a locally bridged building or campus
and a per- packet charge when communications lines are involved (long
distance).
    With this scheme, a person sending one message to someone on
another floor in the same building would pay the same set monthly fee as
someone who sends a hundred messages to another floor. When communications
lines are employed, there would be a charge for every message. Much like
long-distance calls, the more you send, the more you pay. This model makes
sense because the cost of the bridge or router that ties together local
subnets doesn't vary with the amount of traffic flowing across it. But
communication costs do increase as the amount of data sent increases.
    Thus, a department need only be concerned that its clients and
servers are located within the same bridged building or campus, not that
they are all on the same LAN. Further, users are not restricted as to where
they can be located, as long as they stay within the same locally bridged
area.
    The second approach to usage-based billing is closer to what the
local telephone company would like to do. Users are charged for every call
outside of their LAN. The more any group sends, the more it pays.
    With this approach, keeping costs down means keeping everyone in a
department on the LAN. This can lead to some interesting design challenges:
Departments with people on more than one floor will want all of them on the
same LAN. And when people move, departments will want to make sure they
stay on the same LAN.
    Once network managers have sorted out how to implement a
usage-based scheme, they still have to decide whether the billing rates
will be based on distance.
    A distance-sensitive approach does have some fundamental appeal,
and it's certainly familiar. A long-distance call from New York to Los
Angeles costs more than one from New York to Boston. The communications
line from New York to Los Angeles costs more.
    A distance-sensitive scheme is more important when every message
that leaves the LAN is billed for. Users who send a lot of messages between
floors won't be happy to learn their bills are the same as those for users
who send messages across the country.
    There are drawbacks. It's going to eat up a lot of memory tracking
who sent what to whom. And it's also going to lower performance in packets
per second. Add to this the cost of transmitting all that distance-related
data to the centralized billing system, and a distance-sensitive approach
could quickly run into money. Yes, it can lead to a ''fairer'' billing
system, but the question remains what that fairness is worth.
    It's also possible to use an external monitor to track all the
billing data. Here again, that monitor is going to need enough horsepower
to deal with distance-related data, which means it's going to be a pricey
piece of equipment.
    What's best for each corporation is an individual matter. The
problem is, vendors are not going to develop a different system for every
customer. They're big fans of the one-size-fits-all school of thinking. But
which size is it going to be?
    Making billing-data collection an option in routers is the best
answer. Asking for the distance-sensitive approach is tempting but
impractical. Vendors won't like distance-sensitive billing since it demands
so much storage and affects performance.
    If you believe accounting is important, then the most important
thing to do is ask your vendor to provide it. If they don't know you want
it, they're not going to spend much time trying to figure out how to
implement it.
    One reason that billing hasn't been a hot button for vendors may
simply be because LAN internetworking is still a fairly new idea. But that
attitude will change as LAN internets grow and management demands more
accountability.
    If we don't start telling vendors what we want, though, it's going
to get even harder justifying all the money that goes to internets and
explaining to all those below-average users why they should be paying
average rates.

A COMPLETE INTERNET
IN A SINGLE BOX
ODS's server module puts all networking devices
under one cover

By:
Mary Jander

Mention ''LAN server'' to most network managers and they'll conjure an
image of an oversized PC, probably in a tower case with 18 drive bays.
Mention ''internetworking'' and they'll think of more boxes--bridges,
gateways, routers--not to mention the network management system and snarl
of cables needed to connect them all.
    Optical Data Systems Inc. (ODS) has a better idea: Its ODS
Connection Server modules put multiple 80386-based LAN servers inside the
same box as a hub or token ring multiple access unit (MAU), so all the
equipment needed for local networking resides in a single device no larger
than a desktop PC.
    Up to six server modules can reside in one ODS 295 or 296 Modular
System hub chassis, with up to 350 Mbytes of hard disk storage in each
module. Up to 1.2 Gbytes of disk storage can be added with extra cards.
    The combination of servers, interface cards, and other connectivity
gear in a single box gives network managers another important
benefit--fewer devices to be managed. A optional card furnishes a simple
network management protocol (SNMP) agent that allows all the gear in a hub
to be managed by ODS's LanVision and by third-party SNMP managers. The
card also contains an agent for management by IBM's NetView, but only when
using ODS's token ring network interface cards (NICs). When used in ODS's
841 and 861 MAUs, the Connection Server consolidates all devices needed
for 4- and 16-Mbit/s token ring LANs. Both MAUs can handle fiber optic as
well as copper wiring, and both run under IBM's OS/2-based LAN Manager 2.0
and Token-Ring Bridge Program 2.2.
    Both the hub and the MAU versions of the ODS Connection Server run
under Novell Inc.'s NetWare 3.11, Banyan Systems Inc.'s Vines, IBM's LAN
Server, Microsoft Corp.'s LAN Manager, and 3Com Corp.'s 3+Open and 3+Share
network operating systems (NOSs).
    Putting the server inside the hub or MAU lets users take advantage
of a wider range of Novell's networking and net management products. For
example, users can plug Novell's Link/T1 and Link/64 WAN cards into the
hub, and at the same time use Novell's SNA gateway and server management
features.
    And by supporting several NOSs, the Connection Server allows
third-party NICs to be added quickly to its hubs. All that's required is
for the cards be compatible with the hubs' PC/AT-based buses.
    Before, the vendor supplied preconfigured, third-party cards for
T1, X.25, SNA, and 56-kbit/s WAN connections. Without ODS's assistance,
users would have to write their own NOS drivers.
    As with the expanded Novell options, the Connection Server cuts
down on card costs by handling any cards for operating systems compatible
with its AT bus. Users can save processing power by putting only the
runtime version of a NOS in the server.
    ODS's all-in-one approach is a novel one. Other hub vendors,
including Cabletron Systems Inc. (Rochester, N.H.), SynOptics
Communications Inc. (Mountain View, Calif.), and Ungermann-Bass Inc. (Santa
Clara, Calif.), provide NICs and other add-in modules only from
manufacturers that have alliances with them.
    In a twist on the ODS concept, Novell (Provo, Utah) plans to announce
an architecture in which a hub card runs inside a NetWare server. While
this is the exact opposite of the ODS design, Novell's architecture will
achieve the same ends--consolidation of networking devices and
improvements in net management.
   Novell apparently plans to help vendors such as Cabletron create hub
cards that can run on a PC/AT bus, thus tapping the PC's power supply, disk
space, and operating system. Novell will show vendors how to write NetWare
Loadable Module (NLM) agents for SNMP management systems and for NetWare
that will let their hubs be managed byNetWare or SNMP. At press time,
Novell said it had already enlisted the support of 19 hub vendors,
including Cabletron and SynOptics, that would build hub cards using the
Novell specs.
    The ODS Connection Server won't meet the needs of every customer.
Since the only generally available processor is a single Intel 20-MHz 80386
to 33-MHz 80386 and maximum disk storage is 1.2 Gbytes, users with
processor-intensive database requirements or applications with large files,
such as CAD/CAM, had best stick with their current servers. ODS says it
will supply 80286 and 80486 processors on special request.
    Joe Head, ODS senior vice president and cofounder, says he hopes
users will adopt a ''Chinese menu'' approach to the ODS Connection Server.
''We want users to just tell us what they need, and we'll put it into the
box,'' Head says.
    Early users of the ODS Connection Server are attracted by its space
savings and, because it consolidates network devices, its ability to make
LANs more manageable.
    At the University of California at Los Angeles Medical School
(Westwood), LAN manager Bill Rollins tested the ODS Connection Server as a
possible means of reducing the number of dedicated servers in the campus
network. The UCLA Medical School network is based in part on a 16-Mbit/s
fiber optic token ring backbone linked by ODS 841 MAUs. Rollins considered
putting the ODS Connection Server into these MAUs, thereby saving users in
smaller departments the cost of purchasing a server.
    Rollins says the option performed well in tests. He says the server
option is particularly good for users who don't know much about
networking--since everything is included in one hub unit, there isn't much
to set up or fuss with.
    Users can manage their ODS hubs and MAUs in several ways. An
optional management agent card contains SNMP agent software for the ODS
295/296 hubs or 841/861 MAUs and NetView agents for the token ring
connections. This card doesn't take up space that could otherwise be
devoted to network interface cards; rather, it fits into a special,
separate slot in the hub or MAU. The card costs about $3,200 for either
type of system. ODS token ring NICs also can send alerts to IBM's
LAN Manager 2.0 program. When IBM ships its LAN Network Manager replacement
for LAN Manager 2.0 next year, alerts from ODS token ring NICs will be sent
to that system, where they can be filtered and consolidated before being
transmitted to NetView.
    ODS also is working on a NetView/PC proxy agent that will run on
the Connection Server and allow ODS hubs to take advantage of NetView/PC
applications from IBM and third parties in the future. ODS's token ring
NICs and bridges can be controlled by the IBM Token-Ring Bridge Program,
just like IBM's own products.
    Each ODS 295/296 hub and 841/861 MAU also has a dedicated slot for a
card with an EIA-232 connection for out-of-band network management and
diagnostics. Out-of-band testing lets users perform troubleshooting even
if a network crashes. Users also can dedicate one of the LAN segments in
the ODS 295 or 296 chassis to handling management information via an ODS
network management card, thus isolating management from any user's data
stream--an attractive option where security is a concern.
    The ODS Connection Server module comes in different versions for
the hub and MAU. The hub version takes up two card slots in an ODS 295 or
296 chassis. Its components are an Intel 80386 processor; 16 Mbytes of RAM;
an Interactive Data Entry (IDE) hard disk controller; a 3.5-inch hard disk
with a capacity of up to 350 Mbytes right on the card; a floppy disk
controller; and controllers and interfaces for a keyboard and VGA monitor.
    The module fits into the 295 or 296 chassis without switching or
rewiring, ODS says. The vendor cautions, however, that users planning to
perform their own upgrades should know how to configure the drivers that
address the various devices in the hub.
    The total number of ports supported depends on how many NICs reside
in thehub chassis along with the Connection Server. If ODS's own NICs are
used exclusively, a 295 or 296 chassis with the Connection Server can house
up to 120 10Base-T ports; up to 80 thin Ethernet ports; up to 60 attachment
unit interface (AUI) ports; or up to 140 fiber optic interrepeater link
(FOIRL) ports. The hubs also can house up to 160 ports on 4- or 16-Mbit/s
token rings using fiber optic or shielded or unshielded twisted-pair copper
wiring. The number of ports available from third-party NICs depends on the
configurations of those cards.
    Server modules for ODS's 841 and 861 occupy three of the five
slots. One card holds the 80386 CPU and 16 Mbytes of RAM; one contains the
keyboard and VGA interface and floppy disk controller; the third houses the
hard disk controller.
    Unlike the ODS hubs, the 841 and 861 MAUs support IBM's Micro Channel
as well as its PC/AT-bus architecture, and ODS offers 4- and 16-Mbit/s
token ring cards for both kinds of buses. However, it's not as easy to
install NICs in the MAUs as it is in the hubs. A screwdriver and some
know-how with DIP switches may be required.

Product Summary
Product Name: ODS Connection Server module.

Description: A full-fledged LAN server for ODS 295 and 296 hubs and ODS 841
and 861 multiple access units (MAUs).

Vendor: Optical Data Systems Inc., 11-1 E. Arapaho Rd., Richardson, Texas
75081.

Pricing: Depending on hub and options chosen, about $5,000 to $15,000 per
hub or MAU. A hub with Connection Server module and LAN/WAN connections
costs an average of $13,000. A similarly configured MAU costs an average of
$9,000 to $10,000.

Availability: November 1991.

Advantages: Up to six servers can be placed inside an ODS 295/296 hub,
putting server, hub, and LAN ports in one device and simplifying network
management.

Disadvantages: Server modules use a single processor. Also, as options
mount, so does the cost of the hub or MAU.

HUBS WITH A FUTURE

By:
Mary Jander

ADC/Fibermux Corp. has added features to its Crossbow line of intelligent
networking hubs that it says will help organizations planning to migrate to
FDDI or simply needing to extend their LANs.
    The new Crossbow Plus hub includes four more I/O slots, more
powerful I/O modules, and higher-capacity power supplies for support of
fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) cards. Crossbow Plus accommodates
up to 14 Fibermux cards, compared to two, four, or 10 cards for older
Crossbow chassis. The vendor says it will use all existing Crossbow cards,
including those supporting Ethernet, token ring, and AppleTalk LANs, as
well as cards supporting Ethernet-to-Ethernet bridging and management via
Fibermux's own LightWatch simple network management protocol (SNMP)
system.
    Crossbow Plus handles up to 210 Ethernet workstations using
Fibermux's new high-density Ethernet I/O modules, which also run in the
older Crossbow hubs. The new hubs come with up to four 25-amp power
supplies, compared with two available for previous models. Along with five
cooling fans, the power supplies will allow the hub to support FDDI in the
future. Crossbow Plus is rack-mountable and measures 17.5 inches high by 15
inches deep. It is scheduled to ship this month for $1,550. Each power
supply module costs $950.
    ADC/Fibermux also announced the CC6613Z/16, a more powerful
Ethernet I/O module for Crossbow hubs that features 16 ports for 10Base-T
connections. The new module fits in all Crossbow hubs, including older
models as well as the Crossbow Plus. Previous Crossbow 10Base-T modules
only handled up to 10 ports. The CC6613Z/16 also is slated to ship this
month for $2,100.
    Finally, ADC/Fibermux announced a mini-hub called the Crossbow
Extend24 that supports workstations in Ethernet star topologies located
more than 330 feet from the main 10Base-T hub. The Extend24 takes the place
of 24 unshielded twisted-pair cables running from the main hub,
ADC/Fibermux says. The unit measures 1.75 by 11.5 inches, and can be
rack-mounted. Two models are available: The first offers a 50-pin telco
connector supporting 24 10Base-T ports, plus attachment unit interface
(AUI) ports for thick and thin Ethernet connections, for $3,200. The second
model furnishes two fiber optic interrepeater link (FOIRL) ports and an AUI
thick Ethernet connector. It costs $3,325. Optional nonvolatile RAM that
stores network configurations and addressing information for either
Extend24 model costs $100. Like the other products, the Extend24 unit is
slated to ship this month.

FIBER AND 10BASE-T HUBS BOW

By:
Mary Jander

Network Resources Corp. (NRC) has added fiber optic and 10Base-T products
to its MultiGate line of intelligent hubs for Ethernet LANs. The fiber hub
conforms to the fiber optic interrepeater link (FOIRL) standard being
developed for IEEE 802.3 Ethernets. The second is a 12-port version of
NRC's existing 10Base-T Ethernet hub with an integral learning/filtering
bridge.
    Both hubs come with the vendor's MultiGate Manager system. NRC says
both support open systems connections, in that both can be managed by a
range of other vendors' systems and both feature backplanes and media
connections that comply with industry standards.
    The MultiGate Intelligent Fiber Optic Hub allows users to connect
other hubs and devices with FOIRL support in a star topology. The hub can
be configured with four, eight, or 12 fiber optic ports. Backbone ports
support thick and thin Ethernet or thin Ethernet and FOIRL.
    The 10-pound hub, which measures 1.75 by 17 by 13.5 inches,
supports 50-, 62.5-, and 100-micron fiber optic cabling at distances of up
to 1.2 miles. It has 32 LED indicators and can be monitored by a dumb
terminal or NRC's MultiGate Manager, which offers alarms, graphics, and
multiwindow monitoring. The hub provides port-by-port event summaries and
historical and real-time reports. The 12-port version of the
IntelligentFiber Optic Hub costs $6,595. An eight-port version costs
$4,995, and a four-port version costs $3,395.
    NRC's 10Base-T hub connects computers over unshielded twisted-pair
wiring in a star topology, and it supports up to 12 Ethernet ports. A
bridge filters traffic between the hub and backbone networks by protocol
and address. The approximate filtering rate for this bridge is 10,000
packets per second, the fowarding rate is 5,000 packets per second. All
aspects of the hub, which is the same size as the FOIRL version, can be
remotely configured using the MultiGate Manager or the hub's external
management port. The hub costs $2,495.

TOKEN RING LINKS FOR DEC ULTRIX

By:
Mary Jander

The ACP 3300 host adapter from ACC Systems connects Digital Equipment Corp.
workstations running under Ultrix directly to a token ring network without
the need for an intermediate server, according to the vendor. The adapter
complies with the IEEE 802.2 and 802.5 standards and works with both 4- and
16-Mbit/s token rings. The ACP 3300 also uses the routing capabilities
built into the Ultrix kernel, enabling a DEC workstation to act as an
Ethernet LAN gateway to the token ring for other computers on the
workstation's native LAN.
    The standalone box comes with a Motorola 68000 processor and 512
kbytes of RAM. Software included with the adapter performs power-up
diagnostics and installation verification. A driver for VAX VMS systems
also is available. The ACP 3300 costs $5,250.

FDDI SPEEDS
ON UTP

By:
Mary Jander

The T100A network adapter from PC Office Inc. matches the performance of
fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) networks by providing data rates of
up to 100 Mbit/s over unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) wiring, according to
the vendor. The adapter is a 16-bit PC card that fits into a half slot on
IBM PCs and compatibles. It is based on the vendor's 6100 LAN chip, which
uses a proprietary technique called Differential Code Modulation to send
data at 100 Mbit/s over distances of up to about 330 feet and at 50 Mbit/s
nearly 650 feet using UTP. The 6100 LAN chip uses FDDI's standard framing
format, the vendor says.
    The T100A comes with two cable connectors, which means the adapters
can be set up in either star or bus configurations. According to PC Office,
the use of shielded twisted-pair wiring can effectively double connection
distances. With signal repeaters, distances over UTP can reach 2,500 feet,
the vendor claims. The adapter costs $595.

SNA, DEC, AND LAN TRAFFIC ON ONE BACKBONE
Netlink also plans to OEM its software to router vendors

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Good news for the guardians of billions of dollars' worth of IBM and DEC
gear: Netlink Inc. has announced three products that let traffic from SNA
and DEC devices share a backbone with PC LANs and Unix workstations using
IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, and AppleTalk protocols.
    Netlink's SDLC Link Server connects IBM gear such as the 3174 and
3274 communications controllers with 3745 front-end processors (FEPs)
across bridged LAN internetworks rather than leased telephone lines. The
Link Server not only simplifies network design but also costs less to
purchase and operate than comparable offerings from IBM.
    Another Netlink product, the Internetwork SNA Gateway, lets Digital
Equipment Corp. VT terminals emulate IBM 3270 terminals and links the VT
terminals to IBM hosts across the same backbone that carries SNA and LAN
traffic.
    Netlink also plans to resell its SNA software, which is based on
code used by Netlink products since 1988, to third-
party vendors--most likely router makers, which in turn will be able to
market routers that support SNA equipment. Sale of the software has
far-reaching potential, since it gives internetworking vendors lacking SNA
expertise a chance to purchase that expertise outright. If enough vendors
buy Netlink's software, the internetworking market could move away from its
current state of confusion toward greater interoperability and even a de
facto standard.
    The SDLC Link Server connects 3X74 controllers to 3745 FEPs by
converting the synchronous data link control (SDLC) data stream generated
by the controllers to the Logical Link Control 2 (LLC2) protocol sanctioned
by the IEEE for token ring LANs (see figure). The IBM method of linking
3174 controllers to remote FEPs across a LAN internetwork calls for users
to install a 3174 Token-Ring Interface Coupler (TIC) in the controller. The
TIC lets the controller communicate over a token ring LAN using LLC2. Other
IBM communications gear, such as bridges and gateways, also use LLC2. But
there's one big drawback: LLC2 is not a routable protocol, so routers used
in LANs cannot direct LLC2 traffic. Routers equipped with Netlink's SNA
software, however, will be able to direct traffic from SDLC Link Server.
    As noted, the IBM approach also costs more. A single 3174 TIC costs
$3,745, while an SDLC Link Server supporting two 3174s costs $6,490. The
savings grow as SDLC Link Servers are used to connect more 3174s. A 16-port
SDLC Link Server costs $23,000, while 16 IBM 3174 TICs would run $59,920.
Thus, the savings are greatest for sites with numerous 3174s. Moreover, a
connection to older 3274s or other IBM SDLC equipment, such as its banking
systems, isn't available from IBM--it doesn't make a TIC for them.
    As part of the conversion process, the SDLC Link Server adds
modified addresses and other information needed to make the data look to a
host as if it were coming from a 3174 equipped with a TIC.
    The SDLC Link Server's approach is very similar to that used in the
SNACS product line from Sync Research (Tustin, Calif.). Both convert an
SDLC data stream and make the third-party controller look like a 3174
equipped with a TIC. Another entrant in the SNA connectivity field, Cisco
Systems Inc. (Menlo Park, Calif.), takes a different tack with its SNA
routing capability. Cisco allows SDLC to communicate over a LAN
internetwork, just as Netlink and Sync Research do. But Cisco's devices
don't perform the conversions needed to make an SDLC device look like any
other device. They simply transport SDLC through a router-based LAN
internetwork. To the 3745 FEP, the connected SDLC device still looks like a
3174 linked over aWAN rather than a LAN-attached device.
    The SNA software that Netlink will sell to other third-party
vendors offers yet another twist on this theme. As with Cisco routers
equipped with SNA routing--software that Cisco has promised--routers using
the Netlink code will able to form a LAN internetwork that products like
Netlink's SDLC Server Link and Sync Research's SNACS can then use. At
present, only bridges (or routers operating as bridges) can be used to
build such networks.
    Netlink's SNA software also adds capabilities not available through
IBM communications controllers, such as routing of data from 3174 and 3274
controllers to multiple hosts. In comparison, a 3174 with a TIC can send
data to a maximum of two hosts.
    Routers equipped with Netlink's SNA software also offer advantages
when connecting to Logical Unit 6.2 devices. The routers will accept data
from LU 6.2 devices in the same way a 3174 would, but with one improvement:
The FEPs will not have to provide instructions to the router. Another plus
is that multiple 3174s or other Physical Unit 2.0 devices attached to an
SDLC Link Server or router will appear to FEPs as one device supporting
many terminals. This PU 2.0 ''concentration'' function will reduce the
administrative tasks involved in maintaining an SNA network.
    Netlink says its routing software will support IBM's Advanced
Peer-to-Peer Networking (APPN) Network Node scheme if and when IBM
publishes its specifications. Netlink says it supports only those SNA
routing capabilities with published specifications.
    The router software also will support NetView and the simple
network management protocol (SNMP). Router vendors will integrate the
network management capabilities and all the routing functions performed by
Netlink's software into their products by making available certain
Netlink-defined ''hooks.'' The Netlink software, acting as an integrated
part of the routers, will use these hooks to collect information from the
router, such as its knowledge of all available paths through an
internetwork.
    Netlink's Internetwork Gateway connects DEC VT100 terminals to IBM
hosts across a LAN internetwork. It also provides a direct gateway to IBM
hosts for these devices.
    In a typical application, the Internetwork Gateway would attach on
one side to an Ethernet LAN with a DEC or third-party terminal server. To
the DEC terminal server, the Internetwork Gateway appears to be a DEC host.
But rather than provide access to the host, the Internetwork Gateway
converts the Local Area Transport (LAT) protocol used by the DEC terminals
to the 3270 protocol used by IBM 3270 terminals. Like the SDLC Link Server,
the Internetwork Gateway then takes incoming data--in this case, 3270 data
from VT100 terminals--and converts it to the LLC2 protocol for transmission
across the LAN internetwork to a remote IBM 3745 FEP,.
    As a result, DEC terminal users can run 3270 sessions on their
existing DEC terminals, eliminating the need for users to have two
terminals on their desks.
    IBM does not support DEC's LAT protocol. Many third-party terminal
servers available for use with DEC terminals do provide 3270 gateways, but
none provide the LLC2 support of the Internetwork Gateway.
    The Internetwork Gateway supports between 16 and 128 LAT and 3270
terminal sessions, divided among any number of physical terminals. As with
Netlink's router software, NetView and SNMP are supported. The Internetwork
Gateway also supports DEC's Terminal Server Manager network management
software.

Product Summary
Products: SDLC Link Server Models 1, 2, and 3 and Internetwork Gateway. SNA
software for routers has no official name yet.

Description: SDLC Link Server connects SNA computers and communications
gear over LAN internetworks. Internetwork Gateway allows VT terminal users
to run 3270 sessions on hosts accessible via LAN internetworks.

Vendor: Netlink Inc., 3214 Spring Forest Rd., Raleigh, N.C. 27604.

Pricing: SDLC Link Server Models 1 and 2 with SDLC two-and four-port
capacities, respectively: $6,490 to $10,000. Model 3 with 4 to 16 ports:
$10,000 to $23,000. Internetwork Gateway base configuration with 16 LAT and
16 SNA sessions: $7,000; with 128 sessions: $20,000. SNA routing software
prices are negotiated with individual vendors.

PRODUCT POTPOURRI FOR IBM MIDRANGE SYSTEMS

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Andrew Corp. has announced a spate of products for IBM midrange systems,
including an active wiring hub, enhanced file transfer software, and a
Windows graphical user interface for 5250 terminal emulation.
    The SuperStar/400C wiring hub uses coax cabling to connect
twinaxial devices to AS/400 and System/3X hosts or controllers, providing
the benefits of a star-wired network. The hub lets users upgrade their
networks while retaining their original cable investment.
    The hub receives, amplifies, retimes, and splits signals into seven
device channels. All connected devices operate concurrently yet
independently, because each port has its own transmit and receive drivers.
A dual-port model supports up to 14 workstations. The single-port version
costs $695; the dual-port, $1,395.
    Andrew's ETU file transfer software for IBM S/38 and AS/400
computers now features record and field selection, multidevice transfers,
host-batch transfer execution, and entry/exit programs. Tasks that used to
require two or three separate commands now can be accomplished in one, the
vendor says. ETU 5.0 costs $800 for the S/38 and $950 for the AS/400. Users
of earlier versions can upgrade for $149 (S/38) and $249 (AS/400).
    Andrew also introduced TwinView, a Windows 3.0 graphical user
interface for the 3XTwin and Multi-Twin members of its Emerald Series of

MULTITASKING FILE TRANSFER

By:
Eric M. Hindin

The Systems Center Inc. has added OS/2 software to its Network DataMover
series of automated data transfer products. Called Network DataMover-PC for
OS/2 (NDM-PC for OS/2), the product allows IBM PS/2s and other
OS/2-compatible machines to communicate automatically with IBM mainframe
hosts running under the MVS, VM, or VSE operating systems.
    The software uses the Communications Manager component of OS/2
Version 1.3 Extended Edition to set up a synchronous data link control
(SDLC) or token ring connection between the PC and the host. To set up this
connection, the user must have an IBM Multi-Protocol SDLC Adapter or
Token-Ring Adapter installed in the PC.
    NDM-PC for OS/2 performs binary and test file transfers using data
compression.
    Like other programs that take advantage of OS/2's multitasking
capabilities, NPM-PC for OS/2 runs concurrently with Communications Manager
3270 sessions and any other OS/2 sessions on the same machine. NPM-PC for
OS/2 also features a menu-driven user interface. It costs $850.

RUMBA TIME

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Wall Data Inc. has added several products to its Rumba line of PC-to-host
connectivity software, including 3270 emulation for TCP/IP networks and IBM
AS/400 minicomputers and OS/2, French-, and German-language versions of its
flagship software.
    The Rumba TN3270 interface allows PC users on TCP/IP networks to
connect to IBM mainframes through the Microsoft Windows graphical user
interface. It works with mainframe-based TCP/IP Telnet servers to deliver
3270 terminal emulation to PC users. Users can access, use, and integrate
data simultaneously from multiple hosts. TN3270 features include support
for IBM Models 2 through 5 terminals, full mapping of 3270 function keys,
multiple sessions, mainframe graphics, and IND$FILE data transfer. The
interface is included with Rumba Version 3.1, which costs $495.
    The Rumba for 3270 feature is an option for users of Rumba for
AS/400. Users see the familiar Rumba interface, but now they can access
3270 mainframe information and integrate it into their AS/400 and PC
applications. With a few mouse clicks, users can cut and paste information
between 3270 sessions and Windows or AS/400 applications, quickly
assembling elements from disparate host sources. The option costs $200.
    Rumba PM 1.0 allows users of OS/2 with Presentation Manager to
access 3270 host applications. Previously, Rumba was available only under
Microsoft Windows. Rumba PM features include QuickStep, which automates
host access; Hotlinks, which brings in host data to OS/2 applications; and
Hotspots, which activates common host functions. Users also can customize
the keyboard and display colors. Rumba PM costs $495.
    Finally, for international and multinational users, the vendor has
released French- and German-language versions of its flagship product,
Rumba 3.1. Context-sensitive help is provided in both languages. The French
and German versions are available from Wall Data and its distributors in
France and Germany. The packages cost $495 each if purchased in the United
States.

RJE EMULATOR FOR OS/2 AND DOS

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Network Software Associates Inc. has unveiled an 802.2 link driver for its
AdaptSNA RJE PC-to-host communications software package. This makes
AdaptSNA RJE the first RJE emulator for OS/2 PCs to support Logical Link
Control (LLC) environments, the vendor says.
    Remote job entry (RJE) is used by many companies for the efficient
transfer of large amounts of data. RJE under OS/2 is significant because
OS/2 Extended Edition, while providing 3270 and Advanced Program-to-Program
Communications (APPC) and Logical Unit (LU) 6.2 links, ignores RJE.
AdaptSNA RJE can be used for batch transfer applications in IBM Job Entry
Subsystem (JES), Power, or other Virtual Telecommunications Access Method
(VTAM) environments.
    AdaptSNA RJE ($785) is available for both OS/2 and DOS. OS/2 users
can initiate an RJE file transfer and run other applications
simultaneously. AdaptSNA RJE also can be used in unattended operations,
automatically loading when the workstation is turned on and simply waiting
until the host is ready to download.

CONFIGURE ROUTERS ON MULTIPLE SNMP SYSTEMS

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Wellfleet Communications Inc. has introduced a Network Configuration
Utility (NCU) that allows users to configure networks of many Wellfleet
routers from a central workstation. The NCU software works with any simple
network management protocol (SNMP)-based management system running on a Sun
workstation, the vendor says.
    NCU offers a menu-driven interface for setting up new router nodes
and automatically constructs and maintains a Structured Query Language
(SQL) database of information on the network.
    Wellfleet says NCU is simple enough for novice operators to use.
Configuration changes to a network of routers are made from a Unix-based
windowing interface via pop-up menus that prompt the user to define a node
and bring it on-line. For example, to configure an IP router, Wellfleet
says, a user need only enter the IP address, subnet mask, and transmit
broadcast type; NCU automatically supplies the rest of the information
needed to get the router up and running. The product also comes with an
expert editor that allows more technically astute net managers to adjust
parameters and optimize network performance.
    NCU is the first product in Wellfleet's Advanced Internetwork
Management (AIM) program, under which the vendor plans to provide
applications for managing Wellfleet routers on a range of SNMP platform
systems. In the future, the vendor says, AIM value-added SNMP applications
will incorporate various SNMP management information bases (MIBs) for
managing Wellfleet equipment, such as the Remote Monitoring MIB, which
Wellfleet says will offer more comprehensive fault and performance
information than is possible with SNMP MIB II. NCU prices begin at $5,000,
including the SQL database.

NETWORK MONITORING BY PROXY

By:
Eric M. Hindin

Kalpana Inc. has added simple network management protocol (SNMP) support to
its EtherSwitch fast packet Ethernet switches. Network managers now can
remotely monitor and control multiple EtherSwitches from a single SNMP
station.
    EtherSwitch SNMP Proxy Agent combines an SNMP management
information base II (MIB II) agent and an MIB extension that works with
third-party SNMP management systems to generate alarms, collect statistics,
and perform diagnostics. The proxy agent can monitor the traffic load of
each EtherSwitch port, producing reports on both local and remote traffic
loads.
    The EtherSwitch SNMP Proxy Agent runs as a background task on Sun
Sparcstations or servers and can be located on the same platform as the
management station software. EtherSwitch products shipped after July 1,
1991, include the Proxy Agent as a no-cost option. Upgrade kits for units
shipped before then cost $150.

STRONG-ARMING SECURITY BREACHES

By:
Eric M. Hindin

SunSoft has added two packages to its SunShield line of security products:
Account Resource Management (ARM) and Automated Security Enhanced Tool
(ASET). The packages let users customize security for Unix networks.
    With ARM, administrators can specify parameters for functions such
as password length and the number of attempts permitted for gaining access
to a network. They can limit log-on attempts for all or part of the
network, as well as individual systems. ARM also lets network managers
restrict access hours, lock screens, and set automatic expiration limits on
passwords and user accounts.
    ASET lets administrators adjust security levels, automatically
modifying the system to the desired levels. With ASET, network managers can
build a ''fire wall'' between a company's internal network and external
networks.
    ARM and ASET together cost $295 for a single license and $4,500 for
a site license. Additional documentation costs $100 per copy.

'FRAME SERVER' DISHES UP MORE FRAME RELAY FLAVORS
Timeplex's device comes in add-in and standalone versions and offers a
choice of connection types

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Plenty of mux vendors have caught the frame relay bug, but only Timeplex
Inc. offers an interface both as an enhancement to existing muxes and as a
standalone unit. That gives users of the vendor's Link/FrameServer more
choices for connecting FDDI, token ring, and Ethernet LANs--including the
ability to pass SNA traffic across a frame relay link.
    Frame relay is becoming a popular choice for LAN interconnect
because of its low overhead and high data rates (up to 1.544 Mbit/s at
present). By adding a card to Timeplex's Link/2+ multiplexer, network
managers can squeeze more traffic onto available bandwidth.
    Because the frame server also is available in standalone form, a
typical configuration might include sites both with and without Link/2+
muxes (see figure). Sites with muxes most likely will use them to transport
a mix of voice and data, while those without probably will use bridges or
routers to transport LAN data, says James Babcock, Timeplex's vice
president for product management.
    At those sites with a mux, the frame server would permit LAN data
to be carried across the backbone in frame relay form, along with
circuit-switched voice. Regardless of the presence or absence of a mux,
LANs connect to the frame server either directly or through a router.
    The frame relay network can be either a private network (i.e., a
mux-based backbone) or a public frame relay service. To transport data over
the wide area, the frame server encapsulates each data packet in a link
access procedure-D (LAPD) frame, adding a flag and data link circuit
identifier (DLCI) with addressing information at the beginning of each
frame and a frame check sequence at the end. The frame server then filters
the frames based on their DLCIs and sends them to the appropriate wide-area
connections.
    Network managers can transport SNA traffic across frame relay nets
thanks to the frame server's encapsulation of high-level/synchronous data
link control (HDLC/SDLC) frames. The encapsulated SDLC or HDLC frames are
sent across the network in either point-to-point or multipoint mode using
idle suppression (a process that prevents idle SDLC frames from being sent
across the network) for improved bandwidth utilization.
    Timeplex's encapsulation approach differs from that proposed by
many router vendors, according to Jim Harrison, program director for global
network strategies at the Meta Group Inc. (Westport, Conn.), a market
research firm. Harrison says router makers may add SDLC-over-frame
relay support by encapsulating SDLC frames twice--first within TCP/IP
packets, and second within LAP-D frames.
    There are two advantages to dual encapsulation, Harrison says.
First, it allows SDLC packets to be carried not only across the wide area
but also across LAN backbones at remote sites. Second, network managers
have better control over the integrity and routing of SDLC data if it's
encapsulated within a higher-level protocol like TCP/IP.
    However, dual encapsulation is more complex, and in Harrison's view
it's ultimately a stopgap measure. Most industry observers believe frame
relay eventually will include specs for higher-level protocols that would
ensure end-to-end data integrity.
    In addition to SDLC, the frame server also can handle traffic from
Ethernet, token ring, and fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) LANs. The
combination of LANs and WANs it connects to, and how it connects to them,
depends on choice of configuration.
    The unit features a high-speed (550-Mbit/s) bus with a control
board and three slots for add-in cards that supply various connections.
These links can include four T1/E1 lines, up to four Ethernets, two token
rings, and one dual-attached FDDI connection. Any combination of cards can
be installed in the frame server; for example, network managers can choose
to install wide-area cards in all three of the device's slots for a total
of 12 WAN connections. LANs also can connect, via routers, across a T1 link
to the frame server.
    The frame server's modular design means network managers can employ
it in a variety of settings, ranging from switching to routing. In the
12-port WAN configuration, for instance, the frame server acts as a frame
relay switch, accepting frames at a port, filtering them based on the
DLCIs, and forwarding them out one of the other ports. If the unit is
stocked solely with LAN cards, it acts as a multiprotocol router for
TCP/IP, Xerox Network Services (XNS), and Internet Packet Exchange (IPX)
traffic. In this case, LAN data packets are routed based on their TCP/IP,
XNS, or IPX addresses.
    But these two configurations--pure switch and pure router--are
unlikely to be widely employed; users more likely will want some
combination of routing and frame switching. Timeplex's Babcock says
several companies have asked to use the product on a trial basis when it
becomes available for beta testing early next year. One user wants to
install frame server cards in its Link/2+ multiplexers to add support for
frame relay to its time-division multiplexing (TDM) backbone. That company
now uses the backbone for voice and video and wants to add LAN traffic.
Another company has a router-based network to which it wants to add a
frame relay backbone.
    Most multiplexer vendors have been developing some form of frame
relay packet switch for their TDM multiplexers. Timeplex's scheme of
dividing the backbone between packet and circuit data (when the frame
server is installed inside the Link/2+ mux rather than as a standalone unit
connected to a pure frame relay backbone) is a relatively common method
called ''packet over circuit.''
    The essential feature in packet-over-circuit techniques is that the
mux-and-frame server combination uses separate components to process
packets and frames. There are other approaches to combining frame and
circuit technology; StrataCom, for example, creates virtual circuits over a
packet-switched architecture.
    Meta Group's Harrison describes the Timeplex approach as similar to
that of Network Equipment Technologies Inc. (Redwood City, Calif.) and
Newbridge Networks Corp. (Menlo Park, Calif.). ''It's the right move for
Timeplex,'' he says of the frame server. He believes, however, the product
will appeal mostly to network managers who are already Timeplex customers.

ECHO CANCELER ALSO MONITORS PERFORMANCE

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Micro Integrated Communications Corp. says its EC1000 is the first digital
echo canceler that monitors circuit performance. The device, which can be
used by common carriers and managers of private T1 networks, enables users
to control both functions from a single built-in keypad. The EC1000
monitors performance of extended superframe (ESF) format traffic, according
to the vendor.
    Each EC1000 can monitor up to 16 T1 circuits. Operators are alerted
to circuit problems via audible alarms and warning lights that flash on the
unit's liquid crystal display. To cancel line echo, the unit has a residual
echo control that replaces any echo encountered with matched background
noise. The EC1000 also has a dual power supply configured for load sharing.
If one supply fails, the other can maintain adequate power for the unit,
the vendor says. The EC1000 costs $100 per channel.

OS-INDEPENDENT FAX AND VOICE API

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Brooktrout Technology Inc. has announced an application program interface
(API) for its TR series of single- and multiple-channel facsimile- and
voice-line cards. The C-language tool kit helps programmers generate
multiple-channel fax and voice applications for the TR cards. The API
provides a link between Brooktrout's hardware drivers and application
software and includes the T.30 facsimile protocol supported on the
Brooktrout card, so programmers need not study each card's command set or
protocols to develop software.
    The PC/AT-compatible cards, which support combined voice and fax
applications with a single chip, operate under DOS and Unix.
    The API will work with any operating system, trimming development
time, according to Brooktrout. Comprising programming functionsthat combine
ASCII and Group 3 fax data into one structure, the API supports all
Brooktrout voice/fax cards, which cost $2,495 each. The API costs $300.

Johna Till Johnson

Quadrant Software has announced FastFax/Plus for the AS/400, a hardware/
software product for both interactive and batch environments. AS/400 users
can send faxes directly from their terminals without leaving their
applications, while the MIS department can batch faxes for off-hour
delivery using a single command.
    End-users can scan in their own signatures, logos, forms, and
graphics. FastFax/Plus can capture multiple screens and send them in a
single transmission. The product automatically generates custom-designed
cover pages, and it can transmit files created on PCs, such as text and
spreadsheets from WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, and Lotus 1-2-3.
    MIS staff also can add fax capability to interactive applications
with minimal programming and set up AS/400 output queues using FastFax/Plus
options. Another option allows FastFax/Plus to receive plain-paper faxes
and print them on attached HP LaserJet or Canon LBP-8 laser printers.
    The FastFax/Plus includes documentation for both system
administrators and end-users. It costs from $4,995 to $6,495, depending on
the AS/400 model.

SMALL SIZE, BIG FEATURES

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Telebit Corp. has announced the QBlazer modem, a miniature, cube-shaped
V.32 modem for use with all PC- and Macintosh-compatible desktop and laptop
computers. Measuring just 2.3 by 2.4 by 2.4 inches, the modem supports
asynchronous DTE speeds to 38.4 kbit/s. It features CCITT V.42 error
control and V.42bis and MNP Class 5 data compression.
    The QBlazer modem complies with CCITT V.32, V.22bis, V.22, V.21,
and Bell 212A and Bell 102 recommendations. It supports Telebit's extended
version of the Hayes AT command set, contains eight status LEDs and a
speaker, and enough memory for two user profiles and four phone numbers. It
weighs 8 ounces and runs on a 9-volt battery. An optional adapter provides
115-volt, 60-Hertz a.c. power.
    The QBlazer comes with a reference manual, DB-9/25 cable, a DIN 8
cable for the Apple Macintosh, an a.c. adapter, and communications
software. It costs $745.
    Telebit also announced the T3000 modem, which conforms to the CCITT
V.32bis standard. Besides offering V.42bis and MNP Class 5 data
compression, the vendor claims the modem can achieve speeds to 57.6 kbit/s.
At that transmission rate, the modem can provide a dial-up alternative to
leased lines.
    File transfer and protocol support includes UUCP, Kermit, Xmodem,
and Ymodem. Fifteen commonly used configurations are stored in the modem's
firmware, and can be selected and monitored with front-panel LEDs, as well
as with Hayes AT commands.
    The T3000, which supports synchronous and asynchronous operation,
is shipped with remote configuration and diagnostics software and can be
set up with password and callback security. It costs $1,095.

MODEM BOOSTS ERROR CORRECTION

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Microcom Inc.'s QX/4232bis high-speed modem complies with the company's
Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) Class 10 standard to provide virtually
error-free PC communications on dial-up or leased lines, the vendor claims.
The modem also provides CCITT V.32bis transmission at up to 14.4 kbit/s and
effective throughput rates of up to 38.4 kbit/s using V.42bis data
compression, the vendor says.
    MNP 10 maintains data integrity by decreasing transmission rates
when line quality degrades. When interference decreases, the modem
increases transmission speed to its maximum throughput.
    Other features that improve transmission speed include changing
packet sizes to compensate for varying interference levels and beginning
link setup at the most stable line speed. The QX/4232bis costs $999.

MODEM GETS TOUGH

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Aydin Corp.'s Aydin Vector division has announced the MDM-700H, a modem for
airborne applications, including remotely piloted aircraft and some missile
applications. The new modem connects computers over a full-duplex radio
frequency link that utilizes conventional FM transmitters and receivers. It
also can operate in simplex mode without degradation.
    The ruggedized modem operates at temperatures from -20 degrees
Centigrade to +50 degrees C and weighs 8 ounces. It can operate at data
rates of up to 9.6 kbit/s, according to the vendor.
    The MDM-700H Modem transmit section accepts an EIA-232 signal and
converts it into a half-sine shaped pulse. The receive portion accepts the
pulses and recreates the EIA-232 data. The modem costs $2,940.

FROM OLD MODEMS TO NEW

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Release 3.0 of Octocom Systems Inc.'s 8X96 line of 14.4-kbit/s modems can
automatically answer either full- or half-duplex calls. The use of a
half-duplex autodetect mode allows users to phase in the faster devices as
they upgrade from older modems, such as half-duplex 4.8-kbit/s modems. For
instance, modems at central sites can be replaced first, and those at
remote locations can be phased in over a period of time.
    The 8X96 modem works with dial-up or leased lines and connects to a
wide variety of front-end processors, according to the vendor. The modems
support all Bell and CCITT modem standards, including the V.42bis standard
for data compression. In addition, the modems are fully compatible with
Octocom's network management system. Prices for the 8X96 line start at
$1,195.

REMOTE USERS GET LAN ACCESS

By:
Johna Till Johnson

A V.42bis modem from Microtest Inc. comes complete with built-in support
for Novell Inc.'s Internet Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol, giving remote
users direct access to Novell LANs without requiring remote control
software.
    Called LANModem, the 9.6-kbit/s device acts as a peripheral on the LAN
and lets users log in from a remote location and run network applications
as if they were locally attached, the vendor claims. The company's
LANModem-based FastLink software allows file transfer, printing, and
remote control of networked PCs.
    LANModem's second serial port lets more than one user
simultaneously dial in or out of the network, and a second LANModem at the
remote location permits linking via phone lines. The unit also includes
security features, audit trails, setup utilities, and the capability to
perform automatic field upgrades. LANModem works on thick and thin Ethernet
coax, 10Base-T, ARCnet, and 4- and 16-Mbit/s token ring networks. It costs
$1,995.

MAKE WAY FOR THE CAR MODEM

By:
Johna Till Johnson

Outback, a cellular modem from Eagle Cross Inc., can transmit data at more
than 10 kbit/s over some cellular connections, according to the vendor. The
unit, which weighs about 9 pounds, comprises a Telebit Corp. T2500 modem, a
Motorola Inc. 3-watt cellular transceiver and handset, Magicsoft
communications software, a built-in antenna, and an interface board from
Eagle Cross. Power can be provided by a.c. or d.c. lines or by BatPak, a
4.4-amp battery pack that can operate up to 2.5 hours in transmission mode.
The modem connects to a laptop or desktop PC via an EIA-232 serial port.
    Although the Outback can connect to conventional dial-up modems,
data rates with such modems generally are limited to 0.3 or 1.2 kbit/s via
cellular links, according to the vendor. With Outback modems at either end
of a cellular link, data speeds of 16,800 bit/s can be achieved with data
compression, Eagle Cross says. The Outback costs $3,495; BatPak costs $200,
and a carrying case lists for $95.

LinkStar Offers
Integrated Service

LinkStar Communications Corp. (662 S. Military Trail, Deerfield
Beach, FL 33442) has introduced LinkStar directory, an integrated
solution for finding, publishing and promoting businesses and
people on the Internet. The directory allows anyone to have an
instant, free, entry-level presence on the World Wide Web that is
accessible and searchable by any other World Wide Web user.

LinkStar Communications has signed several well-known companies as
charter advertisers, including c 5/8net, Digital Consulting Inc.,
and Success Magazine Conferences. LinkStar is also beginning an
aggressive Partners Program to recruit Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) and Internet Presence Providers (IPPs) to share in
advertising revenue generated from an innovative new technology
developed by LinkStar. The company claims that "LinkStar is
designed to publish your presence on the Web, promote that
presence, and allow you to search for people, organizations and Web
sites with pinpoint accuracy."

The heart of the LinkStar Directory is its free electronic business
card (e-Card) system. Any Internet user with an email address can
easily fill out an e-Card that is accessible and searchable by any
other World Wide Web user. The e-Card includes standard business
card information, as well as a variety of options which allow users
to describe their companies' products and services, and index their
description in a wide range of categories. In addition, the e-Card
provides an automatic hot link to the entrant's email address
and/or World Wide Web home page.

The LinkStar directory includes search capabilities allowing users
to locate listings based on a range of criteria. Searches can be
executed for names, companies, cities, countries, states,
provinces, postal codes, subject categories, key words, or
combinations of these criteria, by direct input into an entry
screen, without the need for Boolean logic entries. Search results
return in order of a proprietary match rating index, display the e-
Card as entered, and link the searcher directly to the information
provider's email and Web locations.

LinkStar users can have their search results sent to them by email
so that they can create their own targeted mailing lists, and
listed organizations will receive monthly statistics via email on
how many times their e-Cards have been viewed by LinkStar users. To
prevent tampering, LinkStar Communications provides each
organization listed in their directory with a security password to
control editing of their listings.

LinkStar claims that their directory is receiving more than 100,000
hits per day and its stock of e-Cards and Web pages have grown to
more than 20,000 since an unpublicized beta version was put on the
Internet last October.

For more information, contact Kevin Rudden or Derek Lane (Tel:
508/369-2100, email: 3566721@mcimail.com), visit the company's home
page at http://www.linkstar.com or send a request to:

Free Site for
Senior Surfers

Millions of seniors already surfing the Internet now have free
access to Grand Times (El Cerrito, CA), a magazine edited for
adults aged 55+. The magazine was launched in its print edition
format in November 1992 and is distributed to older adults in the
San Francisco Bay Area. Reece Halpern, publisher and owner,
recognized that "it is a complete myth that seniors do not use the
information highway or that they are afraid of technology," and
decided to launch the first weekly online magazine for active older
adults.

According to Halpern, a recent survey conducted by Secure Horizons
of 1,750 seniors aged 64+ revealed that 24% of all seniors now use
personal computers at home. Another survey found that approximately
four million seniors use the Internet on a regular basis. Microsoft
reports that 16% of all people who have used a computer are
retirees.

To ensure immediate exposure, Grand Times will have live links with
several online groups including SeniorCom (a senior network
averaging 70,000 visits per month from computer users aged 55-75)
and SeniorNet (a 17,000-member organization of computer-using
seniors).

Publishing Inc. (Tel: 510/527-4337, email: mags@grandtimes.com, or

Ads Delivered
In Real Time

c/net: the computer network (150 Chestnut St., San Francisco, CA
94111) has unveiled new technology that allows advertisers to
deliver custom ad messages to different customers in real-time
based on specific demographic information. The new technology,
called DREAM (Delivery of Real-Time Electronic Advertising
messages) was made available to c/net's advertisers beginning
December 15 on c/net's two World Wide Web sites: c/net online
(http://www.cnet.com) and shareware.com (http://www.shareware.com).
Three direct marketing advertisers, Insight, Internet Shopping
Network, and MicroXperts are the first to utilize the new
technology.

Developed by c/net's technology group, c/net's DREAM software gives
c/net advertisers the opportunity to filter choices for banner ad
delivery based on specific demographic information, such as:
    age
    gender
    zip code
    system platform (Macintosh, PC, Unix, etc.)
    connection speed (14.4 modem, 28.8 modem, ISDN line, etc.)
    browser type (Netscape, Mosaic, NetCruiser, etc.)
    affiliation (AOL, Prodigy, CompuServe, Netcom, etc.)
    domain (EDU, GOV, COM, etc.)
    CD-ROM drive owner or not
    connect from home or office

The program allows advertisers to determine who sees a particular
banner advertisement and who doesn't. For example, a direct
marketing firm such as Internet Shopping Network or Insight, can
deliver one banner to Macintosh users and another banner to PC
users. Similarly, a modem manufacturer can send messages to people
connecting from a slower modem, suggesting they upgrade to a faster
modem. Or a CD-ROM distributor with many different titles could
target only people with CD-ROM drives and, then, further narrow
their target to men or women depending on the title.

Since October of last year, c/net also has offered ARM (Advertising
Response and Monitoring) software, a set of tools that allows
advertisers to evaluate audience response to their messages. Using
ARM, c/net online, advertisers can determine the audience most
responsive to a product or message and compare advertising usage
and response rates against system-wide averages. This technology
has helped c/net to attract more paying advertisers than almost any
site on the Internet, including Microsoft, Intel, IBM, MCI,
Hewlett-Packard and others.

c/net's advertising rates are based solely on actual impressions or
CADs (Confirmed Ads Delivered), with all advertising banners
rotated dynamically through the service. Through c/net's unique
dynamic ad delivery system, advertising is more seamlessly
integrated into the site. Only one advertising banner appears per
page, and always in the premium position--at the top of the page.

For more information, contact: Patrick Toland (Tel: 415/395-7800,
ext. 535, email: patrickt@cnet.com).

Internet Marketing
Excellence Awards

The 1995 Tenagra Awards for Internet Marketing Excellence were
awarded to Federal Express, Ragu, Yahoo!, NetPOST, Software.Net,
and Virtual Vineyards.

According to Cliff Kurtzman, president of The Tenagra Corp. (1100
Hercules, Suite 120, Houston, TX 77058), "these awards provide peer
recognition to significant Internet marketing successes over the
past year. Each success makes our industry more credible in the
public's eye, and recognition of these successes strengthens the
industry." Award nominations are made by an international panel of
Internet marketing experts and final awardees are selected by
Tenagra.

    Federal Express (http://www.fedex.com/) was selected for their
online information center that provides immediate tracking of
package status.

    Ragu Spaghetti Sauce (http://www.eat.com/) was selected due to
their online marketing and brand awareness campaign that is both
fun and entertaining while allowing them to gather customer
opinions and collect valuable information about market trends.

    Yahoo! (http://www.yahoo.com/) has facilitated Internet
marketing by making it possible for users to easily find online
resources.

    As the first Media Relations firm on the Net, Eric Ward and
his NetPOST service (http://www.netpost.com/) pioneered the concept
of a company specifically devoted to Internet online and media

Thomas Online
Corporate Purchasing

Thomas Publishing Co.'s Electronic Purchasing Information Corp.
(EPIC, One Penn Plaza, New York, NY 10001) has introduced an
electronic corporate purchasing network for industrial products.
Called CONNECTSUS, it is targeted to provide timely information on
a potential universe of over one million Maintenance, Repair and
Operations (MRO) products, reducing purchasing time from weeks to
hours and cutting transaction costs by 90%.

The service is made possible by EPIC's new alliance with GE
Information Services (P.O. Box 6403, Rockville, MD 20849-6403).
Companies using CONNECTSUS not only have a large number of products
to choose from, but they can also compare product features and
prices at a glance. Using CONNECTSUS' Windows-based software,
buyers have the ability to research and compare products, negotiate
prices, and, through the alliance with GE, enter orders and make
purchases online with a purchasing card number via the system's
link to Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards.

Buyers using CONNECTSUS are assured of privacy, ease of use, and
greater control over the purchasing of industrial supplies, a
market which accounts for $400 billion in expenditures annually.
The high margin of error and costs associated with the traditional
order process, as much as $150 per purchase, are dramatically
reduced.

Suppliers using CONNECTSUS have the opportunity to show to their
target markets a wider number of products, with a capability of
50,000 product classifications to date, in greater detail than ever
before. CONNECTSUS' reach to corporate purchasers is wider than
available through print catalogues or even CD ROMs. CONNECTSUS
allows suppliers to continually add to their listings, and to
update that information more cost effectively than available
elsewhere.

For more information, contact: Lynthia Romney or John Johmann of
Padilla Spear Beardsley (Tel: 212/752-8338) for Thomas Publishing
Co.

Excessive Fees Block
I'Way Construction

Teleport Communications Group (TCG, New York, NY) has released its
latest "Info Bit" dealing with the roadblocks facing local
telephone competition. This information addresses a key issue now
under discussion by the conference committee working on federal
telecommunications legislation.

Competitive access providers and competitive local exchange
carriers are helping to pave the "Information Superhighway" with
optical fiber. To install such telecommunications infrastructure,
new entrants need access to public 'rights of way'. But, the report
finds, "excessive franchise fees imposed by municipalities retard
infrastructure investment."

Both federal and state courts have supported the principle that
municipalities may not use their police powers over the public
rights of way to generate excess revenue. TCG states that "not only
are excessive franchise fees often illegal, they are always
anticonsumer." Since incumbent providers typically pay nothing for
the privilege of constructing in, under, or over the public rights
of way, a franchise fee charged only to new telecommunications
providers is a barrier to entry. It deprives consumers of state-of-
the-art infrastructure and new telecommunications services at
reasonable prices.

Thus, the report calls for "municipalities charging franchise fees
should do so on a nondiscriminatory basis. All local exchange
carriers, including the incumbent, should be subject to those fees,
which should recover only the actual cost of providing access to
public rights of way. Other states and the U.S. Congress should
follow the lead of Connecticut, Florida and Texas which recently
legislated nondiscriminatory access to public rights of way."

For more information, contact TCG, Gail Schwartz (Tel: 718/355-
2892).

1996 Slowdown in
Electronic Marketplace

International Data Corp. (IDC, Five Speen St., Framingham, MA
01701) has predicted 1996 to be a year of disappointment as
investors and corporations suffer through the discouragingly slow
development of a significant consumer base. By the end of the year,
IDC predicts 20% of the Fortune 500 companies that have commercial
Web sites will close or stop maintaining them, resulting in ghost
sites. The leading online information service providers will derive
more than one-half of their revenue from providing access to the
Web by mid-1997.

IDC predicts that "In 1996 ... the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's 'intoxication' stage to a
'hangover' stage. The high-flying Internet suppliers will have
disappointing financial results, while technical capabilities of
the Internet are stretched to the breaking point." Although IDC
predicts the overall growth in online subscribers will continue to
be very strong, they expect 1996 to show a high turnover rate as
users disappointed by the content on the Web cancel their online
subscriptions.

But, they also predict that during the next five years, the number
of online users will rise to more than 200 million, and by 2010, it
will exceed 1 billion. Industry revenues will jump from $500
billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and corporate spending
will rise from 2 to 2.5% of revenues to more than 5%. In addition,
IDC believes online commerce volume will hit $150 billion or more
by the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

A full copy of IDC's 1996 predictions can be found on IDC's home
page. The address is http://www.idcresearch.com. Interested parties
are welcome to share views and insights with Frank Gens, senior VP
of research at IDC, via email at fgens@idcresearch.com. For more

AT&T Changes
Online Strategy

AT&T Corp. (550 Madison Ave., New York, NY 10022) has signaled an
important strategic change in its computer online services,
planning to abandon the proprietary software required to use its
online services: the Imagination Network, PersonalLink, and
Interchange. Instead, AT&T will reshape its online services around
the technical standards of the Internet, giving them Web-like
hypertext links. The company stated that "the Interchange platform
as we know it will phase out over a year or so, to be dissolved
into the World Wide Web." AT&T bought Interchange from Ziff Davis
in December 1994 for a widely-reported but unconfirmed $50 million.


AT&T said it would be able to take advantage of the best electronic
commerce and navigation software for the Internet, most of which
are not compatible with Interchange. In doing so, AT&T is following
the lead of Microsoft, which in December changed tack to open its
online service for free to Internet users. Most of AT&T's
publishing partners already have their own Web sites. Some analysts
questioned whether they would need AT&T at all in that case.

At the moment, subscribers to AT&T Business Network pay $24.95 a
month for up to 10 hours of use. With this they get free
Interchange software and a Netscape Web browser. AT&T has not
decided if or how it will charge for the service when it is web-
based.

More information on AT&T's new policy can be found at the company's
home page: http://www.att.com/press.

Enriched Internet
Software by InterGo

TeacherSoft Inc. (TeacherSoft, Inc., 903 East 18th Street, Suite
230, Plano, TX 75074) has announced the worldwide availability of
InterGO, termed "the industry's first enriched Internet software."
This new multimedia product combines browsing, searching, email,
file transfer, Telnet, news and extensive reference content, virus
scanning, and screening for objectionable material through a fully
integrated series of familiar scenes.

InterGO's interface uses scenes including an office, library, news
room and treasure map to provide graphic options for users as they
access the Internet. InterGO's library is equipped with The
Columbia Encyclopedia, Fifth Edition; The American Heritage
Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition; Roget's
Thesaurus; a world factbook and atlas; an Internet guide; and
hundreds of literary works which are hyperlinked to the
encyclopedia. Key words within articles in the encyclopedia are
hyperlinked to relevant information sources on the Internet.

The company claims that "TeacherSoft's exclusive search technology
allows InterGO users to retrieve information from Internet sites
instantly on virtually any subject. TeacherSoft has replaced the
bookmark of traditional Internet browsers with a graphically-rich
library, enabling users to create bookcases filled with virtual
books of information." InterGO also simplifies the process of
obtaining an Internet account. During the easy installation
process, InterGO searches for an Internet connection on the user's
computer. If an online service provider is not located, InterGO
lists Internet providers and assists the user in setting up an
account.

In addition to making the Internet easier to use, InterGO
incorporates TeacherSoft's exclusive KinderGuard security screen
and the SafeSurf rating system. These features allow a parent or
administrator to set parameters defining the types of materials
which will be accessible to children or employees. KinderGuard
screens material from Web and gopher sites, ftp archives, news
groups, and even mailing lists. When used in the home, the
screening mechanism enables parents to prevent children from
accessing inappropriate material. In the office, the screening
device can be used to prevent employees from accessing
objectionable sites via a corporate Internet account.

InterGO for Windows 95 is available from most major retailers and
computer catalogers. Suggested retail pricing of the complete
program, including the hyperlinked reference material, is $99.00.
A Windows 3.1 version and a Macintosh version will be available
early this year. For more information, see the company's home page
at http://www.teachersoft.com, call Tel: 214/424-7882 or Fax:

Lotus Changes
Notes to Fit the 'Net

Lotus Development Corp. (55 Cambridge Pkwy., Cambridge, MA 02142),
responding to competitive pressure caused by new Internet
technology, has demonstrated major changes to its hallmark Notes
program that allow it to both read and create information for the
World Wide Web.

Most of the changes are included in a new version of Notes that
went on sale on January 1, 1996. This includes the possibility to
click onto the Web while reading email sent by a colleague in
Notes, or create Web pages using Notes. The steps are designed to
keep Lotus as the leading seller of messaging and groupware
programs, which combine electronic mail and sophisticated
databases.

Lotus has been increasingly threatened by technical standards
related to the Web that allow documents to be linked easily
regardless of the computers involved, something that Notes first
made popular. Those technical standards occur in Web programs, such
as browsers, that are less expensive than Notes.

Thousands of companies are incorporating Web standards in
communications programs not just for the Internet but on their
internal computer networks, something that's become known as an
"intranet." The new products put Lotus at the forefront of major
software producers who are changing their goods to embrace the
global data network. Pricing for Notes server software starts at
$495.

Internet Watchdog
Monitors Users

Charles River Media (P.O. Box 417, 403 VFW Dr., Rockland, MA 02370)
has announced Internet WatchDog for PC and Macintosh computers, a
monitoring tool for the Internet and personal computers. Internet
WatchDog does not censor what is being displayed; rather it makes
a record for later viewing by authorized individuals.

Using this utility on any PC or Macintosh, parents, teachers and
employers will be able to view the activities taking place on their
computers without arbitrarily limiting access to the Internet or
creating a false sense of security by simply "blocking" certain
sites or keywords. As new sites are added to the Internet everyday,
it is impossible to "block" unsuitable Internet activity. Internet
WatchDog allows the user to monitor computer use, much like a
telephone bill enables the caller to see a listing of phone
numbers.

Internet WatchDog functions by capturing screen and other
information "intelligently" while the computer is running. The user
will be able to review a grid-like screen with a series of
thumbnail screen captures. For a closer look, any screen capture
can be seen full-size. In addition, Internet WatchDog records usage
of all software applications whether Internet related or other
computer activity. A password is required to access the monitoring
capabilities of the program, and any attempt to circumvent or
tamper with the Internet WatchDog is also recorded.

Internet WatchDog, priced at $29.95, is available from computer
software stores, bookstores, mail order catalogs, and Charles River
Media, Order Desk (Tel: 800/382-8505, email: chrivmedia@aol.com).

'Super Spider'
for the Web

Digital Equipment Corp. (111 Powdermill Rd., Maynard, MA 01754) has
introduced the Internet's first "super spider" software for the
World Wide Web. It conducts a comprehensive search of the entire
Web text at speeds up to 100 times faster than spiders used in
conventional information search services. The technology promises
to surpass the limitations of current information services by
delivering the most complete, precise, and up-to-date information
of the Web's entire text. The technology's super spider and super
indexer employ next-generation software and advanced networking,
powered by the highest-performing 64-bit Alpha computers.

The super spider creates and dispatches a "brood of spiders" that
crawls the entire Web. Second-generation scalable software
simultaneously locates and indexes text as it finds Web pages. A
search engine enables Web users to conduct precise searches for
specific information by looking for phrases, specifying key words,
using case-sensitive matches, and restricting searches to titles or
other parts of a document. Network connectivity is provided through
Digital's fiber optic and high-speed network switching
technologies. Ultra-high-speed search and indexing is enabled by
Digital's 64-bit servers.

Digital made the "beta" version of this technology available on
December 15, 1995. Users can test the super spider's Web index and
provide feedback through Digital's Internet address at:
http://www.altavista.digital.com. For more information, contact: Ed
Canty (Tel: 508/264-6672), Sarah Miller (Tel: 508/264-6673), Tom

Connect Schools
to Internet Now

The Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure, a
panel appointed by president Clinton has recommended that
communities should push schools and libraries onto the information
superhighway by the year 2000. Connecting each public school to the
Internet by the year 2000 would cost 1.5% to 2% of schools'
budgets, or about $11 billion, the report estimated. That assumes
putting about 25 computers per school into a special classroom, or
lab, where a school's teachers can bring classes once a day.

But schools often remain leery of making big computer purchases,
worried they will buy the wrong thing or spend thousands on quickly
obsolete equipment, the panel noted. Poorer school districts and
those in rural areas face special problems. Often, schools must do
extensive renovations simply to get modern phone lines into
buildings constructed 50-70 years ago.

The panel found success stories others can follow:

    In Chester Ridge School District in Fishertown, PA, teachers
each year seek corporate grants that provide free Internet access,
then use the time to train colleagues and help students.
    A radio station in Lansing, MI, formed a partnership with
seven schools to help students email questions about current events
to the news staff, the White House, the governor and people around
the world.
    At Rosa Parks Interparish Elementary in Baltimore, MD, a
corporate grant helped students talk via computer with the school's
namesake, the legendary civil rights activist.
    In Taos, NM, students and adults use a university's computers
to look for jobs, visit a virtual library, get health information
or send email to lawmakers. The town, the state, local businesses
and corporations help pay.

The report found that parents with technical knowledge often are a
school's best resource. But it encouraged schools to seek help
anywhere: from corporations, state agencies, colleges or even by
switching money in their own budgets. About 1.3% of public schools'
spending is now devoted to technology, the study found.

Plug And Play
Security Solution

Digital Secured Networks (DSN) Technology Inc. (New York, NY) has
previewed its Net G-1 security device, a hardware unit that
provides an economical plug-and-play solution for absolutely secure
data transmission over the Internet and other internal and external
networks. Incorporating DSN's patent-pending "Electronic Privacy
Switch" technology, the Net G-1 offers transparent security,
authentication and encryption for network users.

The company claims that "Net G-1 is part of a bold new core
technology which greatly enhances the level of security for users
of the Internet, LANs and WANs, and will eventually be included in
other telecommunication applications."  The product is not a
firewall but can complement, support or replace a firewall or other
security software solutions.

The Net G-1, which resembles a small black-cased desktop computer,
provides a distributed security mode that cannot be entered or
decoded. With Net G-1, encryption does not take place over network
lines. So hackers, intruders or unauthorized personnel cannot
intercept, log onto, subvert or decode messages.

The Net G-1 is a completely plug-and-play device. The user plugs in
three cables and requires no further maintenance or support. Once
connected, the unit self-configures to PC or server's IP and
Ethernet address. It then automatically uses sophisticated
handshake mechanisms and authentication procedures and generates
unique public key encryption. These are combined with the private
keys on the receiving Net G-1 unit and establish a common secret
key connection between each pair of nodes.

Pricing for the Net G-1 will be "around $5,000.00 per unit" and
units will be available for sale in the first quarter 1996. DSN
officials are offering free evaluation/testing units to those
interested.

Microsoft Proposes
I'Net Digital Signature

Microsoft Corp. (One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399) has
proposed an Internet digital signature initiative to provide a
safer environment for executable code on the Internet. To address
concerns about potentially malicious code or viruses, this
technology will enable users to verify that a program's integrity
is free of third-party tampering. Browsers will be equipped with
the ability to automatically download applications from a list of
vendors approved by the user. If the author is not on the user's
pre-approved list, the browser can display the signature of the
executable code and allow users to make an informed decision on
whether to proceed with the download.

Microsoft plans to propose the Internet digital signature
specifications to the W3 Consortium (W3C) and the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an open Internet standard. The
technology will be an open, proposed specification available to the
entire Internet community. In addition, as part of the Open Process
Design Review, Microsoft will host a digital signature design
preview to solicit feedback from the Internet community.

Medicine Cruises
Info Autostrada

Remote-controlled surgery, dietary advice and prescriptions for
yoga or antibiotics should soon be coming down the information
autostrada to a place near you, experts have predicted at a
telemedicine conference in Adelaide, Australia.

Futurist Dr. Peter Ellyard said communications technology offered
a great new chance for people to control their own health and well
being. People would be able to enter their own health profile into
personal computers and receive information to help them tailor
their own personal diet, exercise, stress control and health
programs and diagnose and manage some illnesses at home.

Dr. Ellyard said telemedicine should teach people about yoga,
shiatsu, traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine and other
complementary medicine as well as conventional treatments so people
could focus on creating health instead of ignoring their bodies

Australia has a long tradition of telemedicine from the first Royal
Flying Doctor Service pedal radios brought to remote settlements in
1927 to a 1961 emergency operation in Antarctica directed through
telegrams by a brain specialist in Melbourne, to today's
telepsychiatry. And experts at the South Australian Health
Commission and Northern Territory Health Services conference say a
revolution is on the way, with Australia aiming to be at the
forefront of Asian telemedicine.

Design Your Own
Home Page on the 'Net

Recently, more and more services are being offered on the net for
individuals as well as businesses to design their own home page,
requiring a minimum of technical expertise as well as little or no
cost. Below is a sampling:

Home Page Wizard. CompuServe Inc. (500 Arlington Centre Blvd.,
Columbus, OH 43220) is expanding access to its Web page creation
and publishing tools, now also being available for businesses.

The "Home Page Wizard" can be used to build a page of up to one
megabyte and place it in CompuServe's Our World area
(http://www.ourworld.com). The Home Page Wizard and "Publishing
Wizard" are currently available for free to CompuServe members (GO
HPWIZ). While CompuServe is developing more advanced features to
create a specialized business-oriented service, businesses are
invited to start now in Our World and upgrade to the more advanced
corporate service when it becomes available. CompuServe said that
to date, more than 17,000 personal home pages have been posted in
the Our World area by CompuServe members. The Home Page Wizard
software package was downloaded from the CompuServe Information
Service over 35,000 times in the first ten days of availability.
For more information, contact Jeff Shafer of CompuServe, Tel:
614/538-4632 or visit CompuServe's home page at
http://www.compuserve.com.

Instant Home Page. Web Communications (Santa Cruz, CA) is offering
an online service that allows anyone to instantly create a World
Wide Web site simply by filling out forms in their Web browser. The
"WebCom Instant Site Service" offers reference and overview
information and five individual page creation forms. The overview
takes clients through a step-by-step process of creating pages,
where they can select the pages they wish to create, and enter
information into the automated form. They are then presented with
forms for five standard Web pages, including a home page, feedback
form, sign guestbook form, guestbook page, and a hotlist page.
After the file name is confirmed, clients can view their completed
web page.

Web Communications provides a guest account which can be used by
anybody on the Internet to try out the WebCom Instant Site Service.
The guest account can also be used by visitors to create their own
custom Web pages, or modify the pages created by the WebCom Instant
Site Service.

Web Communications was founded in May 1994 by Chris Schefler and
Thomas Leavitt to provide tools, resources, and services designed
to assist individuals and organizations to publish and communicate
effectively and affordably over the Internet. The company currently
hosts 1357 individual Web sites. For more information, contact Web
Communications, Chris Schefler (Tel: 408/457-9671).

WebWho. Scientific Research Management Corp. (1714 Ringwood Ave.,
San Jose, CA 95131) offers WebWho (http://webwho.com), which allows
users, for a nominal charge, to create a mini-home page,
approximately 150 words in length, with up to two hyperlinks, and
to define and control their directory listing even if they don't
have an existing Web site, email address or Internet connection.
Web explorers can immediately use WebWho, at no charge, as a Web
navigation directory to locate businesses and individuals on the
Internet. In addition to determining their directory listing, home
page owners will be able to specify up to 20 keywords to further
define their Internet presence. Unlike other Internet navigation
tools, home page owners will be able to dynamically change their
description, hyperlinks and keywords at any time and as often as
they desire.

Customers who already have an Internet presence, can also reap the
benefits of WebWho, by complementing and enhancing their existing
home page. Home page owners can choose the search category,
keywords, description text, and hyperlinks to their existing home
page or emailbox. The probability that Internet explorers will find
them should be greatly increased.

For more information, contact: Skeeter Wesinger, or Peter Bowen,
both of SRMC (Tel: 408/437-1813, email: info@webwho.com).

CA Real Estate
Online

Many California real estate agents are now able to tap into what
could be the largest online offering of information about homes and
condominiums to date. Members of the Greater Inland Valleys
Multiple Listing Service Inc. (MLS) will be offering their home
listings via the Internet on a system that ties in listings
throughout Southern California. The Homeseekers Web
(http://www.homeseekers.comsite) brings together up to 40,000 home
listings across Southern California, many offering photos and
specific addresses. Homeseekers is the creation of Visual Listings
Inc. (Brea, CA), which is operating kiosk-based New Home Search
systems in shopping malls.

The service has about 3,200 members from several local boards of
Realtors. The site already contains thousands of listings from
regional MLS systems covering Orange County, the Los Angeles area
and the Greater South Bay region. Real estate agents at boards in
the Coachella Valley and High Desert are expected to join the
network soon. And board-operated MLS systems in San Diego County
and elsewhere in the state may also join soon.

The system allows consumers to narrow their search from a wide
selection of criteria, including city, price range, home style
(single-family, condominium) number of bedrooms and baths, size of
garage, and by other features, including formal dining room, pool,
spa, fireplace and family room. Consumers also can limit the search
to only homes where open houses are scheduled so they only are
shown houses they can go and see that day.

Each property listing also has room for one color photo of the
property. Brokers or agents may add up to three more photos per
listing for an additional cost. A 20-second soundtrack also can be
added at extra cost. Many of the listings include the property's
address so consumers can drive by the listing first. Agents also
can have a link to their own Internet home page added to each
property listing. The home page includes a photo and brief resume
and other properties the agent has to offer. They also can add
electronic mail and fax-back capabilities for consumers to use. The
home page costs the broker or agent $50 a year.

Homeseekers joins a growing list of Internet sites offering
property listings. Indeed, there are an estimated 4,800 such Web
sites across the U.S. Unlike other Internet sites, the Homeseekers
and California Association of Realtors Internet sites allow real
estate agents to list their properties for free--they pay no
advertising fee for the service other than the listing rates
already paid to be part of their local MLS. The systems make money
through other companies that sponsor or advertise on the networks.
These "sub-advertisers" pay from $250 to $500 a month to be on the
network, but also must agree to promote their company's presence on
the Internet.

Internet World
Trade Center

A new business-oriented web site (http://www.internetWTC.com)
designed as the virtual equivalent of a skyscraping world trade
tower has opened for business on the World Wide Web. With over 100
floors and a marble-walled lobby, the Internet World Trade Center
(iWTC, Box 5474, Route 46 East, Parsippany, NJ 07054) offers
visitors hundreds of features including investor services; trade
show listings; news and weather updates; hyperlinks to 20 major web
search engines; a medical information facility; an entertainment
and gaming center, and, from its observation deck, downloadable
views of New York's skyline and harbor that are always
spectacularly clear.

Visitors to the Internet World Trade Center enter through its lobby
where a newsstand offers USA Today, Time Magazine, the Financial
Times and many other publications. A tenant directory can be
searched by company name or by product or service. Companies are
grouped by industry. For example, electronics firms are located on
the 11th floor, insurance companies on the 19th and software
developers on the 29th. Government  offices occupy the 15th floor
where visitors can drop in on Congress, the CIA, FBI, and over a
dozen other federal agencies. Those stopping at the 22nd floor
Medical Information Center can gather background on everything from
rhinoplasty to organ transplants. A major feature of the iWTC is
immediate access to 20 major web search engines including Web
Crawler, Yahoo, Gopher and Lycos. There is also a package tracking
center for users of Federal Express, DHL and UPS.

iWTC provides potential member companies all necessary services to
get started including design of online advertising and
communications, support of order entry and electronic data
interchange (EDI) and database integration. Companies lease space
in the Internet World Trade Center by purchasing various-sized
units of online pages. These range from inexpensive one-page
business cards to 60-page areas capable of housing multimedia
annual reports, executive overviews and interactive advertising.
iWTC installations also enable advertisers to process orders and
transactions, maintain catalogs and provide customer support.

Firms already established on the Internet may opt for a welcome
page that offers visitors a description of their products and
services and a direct connection to their home page via hyperlink.
Retailers can set up shop on the iWTC's mezzanine mall. The
classified advertising section accommodates real estate, help
wanted, used equipment and legal listings.

For more information, contact: Kenneth Browne at IWTC (Tel:
800/579-8656 or 201/244-1785).

IRS Promotes
Internet Filing

With the official start of tax filing season, the Internal Revenue
Service has said it is expanding its electronic services. The IRS
is putting more information on the Internet, rolling out a
telephone filing system nationwide and laying plans to expand
filing of tax returns on personal computers.

To reach more taxpayers, or at least those who are computer-
literate, the IRS is improving its online information network, such
as the "Fedworld" Internet home page at http://www.irs.ustreas.gov,
with answers to frequently asked questions and forms that taxpayers
can download. Also this year, taxpayers can file another form that
will direct-deposit refunds into a savings or checking account.

The agency is planning a project called CyberFile that would allow
taxpayers to file electronic returns directly. At present, the IRS
requires that electronic filings be sent via a middleman, such as
a professional tax preparer. The project will start with a test in
six states, but IRS officials say they haven't decided just where
yet.

Complete Internet
Commerce Package

SBT's (1401 Los Gatos Dr., San Rafael, CA 94903) Internet Div. has
announced that its electronic storefront package, WebTrader 2.0,
will integrate Checkfree's (8275 North High St., Columbus, OH
43235) credit card processing service providing a complete, secure
Internet commerce solution. The combination allows any company to
sell products on the Internet, automate order entry and fulfillment
and receive credit card payments electronically. WebTrader has a
suggested retail price of $1,295.

The Internet commerce solution process will be initiated by a
merchant contacting an SBT Internet Business Consultant (IBC) who
will install and configure WebTrader and provide the client with
the Checkfree Merchant Application package. The IBC will arrange
for a Checkfree account manager to be assigned to the account who
will assist with the application process. The IBC will then
customize and modify the WebTrader application, and tailor
Checkfree's processing to the merchant's specific needs. Once the
application has been processed and approved, the IBC will
coordinate site testing for credit card transactions. At that point
the merchant is equipped to conduct business on the Internet.

WebTrader allows businesses to create an electronic storefront with
order forms for products or services on the Web. It automatically
processes the orders and sends the customer confirmation via email.
WebTrader initiates and completes the sales process by providing a
direct, instantaneous connection between vendor and customer.
WebTrader also includes RSA Data Security's (100 Marine Pkwy.,
Suite 500, Redwood City, CA 94065-1031) encryption software which
keeps credit card numbers and other sensitive data private once it
is received by the vendor's Web server.

WebTrader can be used as a stand-alone Internet application or in
conjunction with SBT's Pro Series 3.0i accounting software. System
requirements for WebTrader users are minimal: A 486 66Mhz or higher
computer, 12 Mb of RAM, an account with a major Internet provider,
Windows 3.1 or higher, a 14.4 modem, and an Internet mail
connection.

Visa's New
Electronic Services

Major U.S. financial institutions are implementing a fully
electronic back-end bill-payment system developed by Visa
International (San Francisco, CA), linked to remote-banking
services offered by a growing number of financial institutions.

Visa is commencing electronic bill-payment programs with major U.S.
financial institutions, including Banc One Corp., Barnett Banks,
The Chase Manhattan Bank, Crestar Bank, First Bank System, First
Interstate Bank, First Chicago, First Tennessee Bank, First Union
National Bank, Mellon Bank, Norwest Banks, Star Bank and U.S.
Bancorp. Teaming up with major billers, such as utility companies,
additional financial institutions are expected to utilize Visa's
new turnkey system in first quarter 1996.

In addition to enhancing front-end, remote-banking programs by Visa
Interactive, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Visa International, and
other providers, Visa's newly U.S.-patented, back-end standard is
expected to significantly reduce remittance-processing
inefficiencies for participating financial institutions and
organizations that bill for goods and services. Visa's back-end
system also enables billers to electronically send invoices to
their customers who pay bills online, expected to be available in
mid-1996, aimed at reducing the cost of printing and mailing
statements.

Many financial services providers and commercial billers currently
offer electronic bill payment systems that are only partly
electronic. Visa estimates that more than 60% of "electronic" bill
payments are converted to paper to complete the payment process.
The Visa solution is fully electronic, improving efficiency for
billers and financial institutions. Future enhancements are
expected to include multi-currency, cross-border payment
settlement.

Sterling Software (Dublin, OH) worked with Visa to enhance
electronic connectivity between financial institutions and billers-
-the final link--to create a turnkey, member-controlled payment
system.

For more information, contact: Greg Jones (Tel: 415-432-2753) or
visit Visa's Internet home page at http://www.visa.com.

Investment Advice
on the Net

INVESTools, (http://INVESTools.com), developed by Tabula
Interactive Inc. (3905 Bohannon Dr., Suite A, Menlo Park, CA
94025), now offers a total of 21 publications. Among the
newsletters and research recently added are Zacks Earnings
Estimates, Al Frank's The Prudent Speculator, John Dessauer's
Investor's World, Individual Investor's Special Situations Report,
George Putnam's The Turnaround Letter and the No-Load Fund Analyst,
produced by the Litman/Gregory investment management firm. Reuters'
Corporate World News Service will also soon be integrated into the
site.

INVESTools brings together a selection of top-performing investment
newsletters and research, providing top advisors' analyses,
including useful recommendations such as model portfolios.
Investors can either browse through INVESTools' collection of
impartial advisory information, or quickly perform searches on
specific stocks.

INVESTools offers free access to newsletter excerpts, headlines,
searches, sample issues, discussions and educational materials.
Paid publications are available by subscription or a la carte
pricing. When users read the contents of investment letters,
earnings estimates and other paid services, they are charged only
for the elements they choose. Payment is by credit card or
CyberCash. Most reports and articles fall into the $3-$10 price
range, and new registrants currently get a $25 user credit.

INVESTools is part of a broad trend toward investor self-help. More
individuals are taking control of their investment activities using
PCs and online information, because they realize that if they don't
plan for their own financial security, no one will. This growing
number of self-reliant investors has fueled the explosion of
discount brokerage firms, 401K savings and mutual funds. Computer
technology has become a key tool that allows these investors to
choose and track their holdings. Sources of commodity information
like stock quotations and historical charting have become
widespread. Now investors are looking more for qualitative,
advisory material to help guide them.

DATA POINTS

Liberty Financial Companies Inc. (125 High St., Boston, MA
02110) has introduced the WebSaver Annuity on the World Wide Web
(http://www.websaver.com), the first financial product specifically
designed and priced for the Internet. By exploiting the
efficiencies of the Internet, Liberty Financial says, the WebSaver
Annuity lowers its sales and operating costs and then passes those
savings on to the online customer in the form of higher guaranteed
rates. The WebSaver Annuity is a guaranteed return annuity that
allows customers to order a policy online, while funding the policy
with a check sent through traditional mail to avoid potential
security concerns. However, because of local laws, the annuity
product is only available in 24 states.

    Prudential Insurance Co. of America has launched an
interactive World Wide Web site at http://www.prudential.com.
Prudential claims that their site is different from others because
it is 'needs-based,' meaning that it provides consumers with tools
and calculators that can help them figure out, and plan for, their
short-and long-term financial needs. Prudential says it has no
intention of offering actual sales through the Internet.

    According to the Kansai Employers Assn., some 2,000 companies
will start exchanging information via the Internet on both vacant
positions and employees they plan to transfer to other companies,
possibly as early as March 1996. Under the human resources exchange
network project, western Japan-based companies will seek to help
employees being encouraged to look for work elsewhere as a result
of corporate restructuring. The network would allow both companies
and employees who are subject to restructuring to access a database
on human resources and available positions. Proponents of the
system would also like to include companies in Tokyo and Nagoya to
use it. The new system would provide such data as employees'
skills, job careers and annual salaries, while protecting their
privacy.

    The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will soon
go live on the Internet, with a computer database that offers
information on everything from sex to business, to provide material
on its member-nations. The ASEAN home page will give information on
each ASEAN country, reports from their ministerial and security
meetings, documents on the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), economic
cooperation and investment policies of its members. No dates were
immediately available on when ASEAN goes live on the Internet.

INTERNET ACCESS: NEW WORLD WIDE WEB INTERFACE SOFTWARE FROM CUADRA SPURS
"INTRANET" USE; STAR/WEB FROM CUADRA SUPPORTS GROWING TREND AMONG FORTUNE
1000 COMPANIES OF USING WEB TECHNOLOGY FOR INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS

New technology originally designed for use with the Internet World Wide
Web, the global network of publicly accessible computers, is increasingly
being used by Fortune 1000 companies for strictly private use on their
internal networks for in-house communications and information storage and
retrieval.

And STAR/Web, a software product by Cuadra Associates, a leading software
developer based in Los Angeles, is helping them do it.

The use of Web concepts and technology in internal networks is being
widely referred to as "Intranet." One of the major attractions is that it
lets companies give their staff members better access to internal
information resources, regardless of whether they use PCs, Macs,
X-terminals, RISC workstations, or any combination of these.  It also
allows them to store data on a number of different systems, yet access the
data through a common user interface.  Any desktop workstation for which
there is a Web browser can be used to access corporate data easily through
the company's Intranet.

Early adopters of Web technology for in-house information, such as Pacific
Bell and Amdahl Corp., claim that their investments in the Intranet
approach and STAR/Web are already paying off handsomely.  STAR/Web is a
common gateway interface (cgi) program that connects STAR, Cuadra's
powerful information management and retrieval software, to any standard or
commercial Web server so it can be used to provide sophisticated,
interactive information retrieval to large corporate databases.

"Our purchase of STAR/Web has allowed Amdahl to move swiftly towards our
goal of creating a Web window into vast amounts of corporate data which
has previously been locked up on individual machines or on specific
platforms," says Christel Casjens, information specialist at Amdahl Corp.,
a leading data communications supplier.  "It has enabled us to capitalize
on our prior investment of creating a corporate `Intranet', as well as
employee familiarity with the Internet and Web browsers.  All of these
factors make us confident that the tools being built using STAR/Web will
facilitate the flow of timely information to all employees, which can only
lead to greater corporate responsiveness to the changing market
environment."

At Pacific Bell, the incorporation of the Intranet model has changed the
way that the company views and uses information resources.  Pacific Bell
is standardizing desktop tools throughout the company and using STAR/Web
for internal access to the information in its Corporate Intelligence
Center.  "We have been actively exploring ways to exploit other sources of
information," says Ralph Miller, director of the center.  "Departments
within Pacific Bell have developed Web sites to disseminate information to
other departments, so we're experiencing increased awareness and usage of
internal information sources horizontally across the corporation."

Pacific Bell and Amdahl are typical of organizations that have created and
collected a great deal of valuable data -- their "corporate memory" --
stored on a number of different computers using more than one software
package.  Getting access to such data has typically been very difficult to
do, particularly since it involves learning multiple interfaces or search
systems.

Now, with standard Web software and facilitating software such as
STAR/Web, the distributed information model popularized on the Internet
provides an easy solution.  If the search software follows the common
gateway interface standard and the data includes hypertext links, staff
members can use Netscape, Mosaic, and other Web browsers already familiar
to them to search and retrieve information of almost any type or length.
When users find relevant information, they can "click" on hypertext links
and find other, related information, no matter on which computer on the
internal network the data is stored.

The role of STAR/Web in the Intranet model is to support the searching of
large databases, with sophisticated, interactive, assisted searching.
Unlike the typical clicking through menus to find a succession of
"screens," STAR/Web users enjoy a full array of high-performance
interactive information retrieval capabilities appropriate for large
databases representing paper, electronic, and image files.

For more information, contact Cuadra at 310/478-0066, 800/366-1390, fax
310/477-1078, or e-mail to hq@cuadra.com.

Amdahl is  a worldwide supplier of large-scale System/390 compatible
processors, UNIX systems software and servers, data storage subsystems,
data communications products, applications development software, and a
variety of educational and consulting services.  Amdahl products are sold
in more than 30 countries for use across all types of computing
environments.

NEW NETWORK: CONSTRUCTION UNDER WAY ON NEW FIBER-OPTIC NETWORK FOR NEW
ENGLAND

Construction of a new fiber-optic communications network for New England
has begun, FiveCom Inc., of Waltham, Mass., announced today.

"The NEON light is on, and we're moving," said FiveCom president Victor
Colantonio, referring to FiveCom's New England Optical Network
communications project.

"We're installing NEON's 36-mile link between Hartford and Springfield,"
Colantonio said.  "That moves us toward our first-phase goal of a 410-mile
network backbone linking most cities in three New England states by the
end of 1997.  The fiber-optic system will offer high-capacity transmission
of voice, video and data.  We expect to build continuously from that
backbone to serve the entire New England region, and possibly eastern
Canada as well."

The first phase of NEON is being built in the areas of Connecticut,
Massachusetts and New Hampshire served by the operating companies of
Hartford-based Northeast Utilities.  FiveCom has long-term agreements
allowing it to install fiber-optic cable throughout the utility's service
area.

FiveCom will seek to negotiate similar agreements with other New England
utility companies to expand its reach.  It has secured a letter of intent
from Central Maine Power Co., Maine's largest electric utility.

Construction costs for the first phase of NEON could exceed $30 million,
including tasks such as installing specially manufactured 96-fiber cable.

FiveCom is offering leases of fiber-optic capacity to major carriers that
will be less costly than new construction by the carriers themselves.
"Piggybacking fiber on utility property is a win-win move," Colantonio
said.  "It adds value to an existing asset for the utilities, and offers
carriers a fast and economical option for adding extremely reliable
capacity to their systems."

FiveCom shareholders recently voted to sell a controlling interest in the
privately held company to MaineCom Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Central Maine Power Co.  Besides stock, MaineCom gains seats on FiveCom's
board and contracts for the continued services of FiveCom principals.
Legal and financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.

"This a terrific opportunity for Central Maine Power and MaineCom
Services," said Gerald C. Poulin, chairman of MaineCom's board and a CMP
vice president.  "The technology is proven, the potential market is big,
and FiveCom's position in the market is impressive."

Poulin added, "The relationships we're building by this investment could
lead to new utility partners, joint ventures and strategic alliances that
could promote FiveCom's expansion."

MaineCom Services began operations earlier this year after the Maine
Public Utilities Commission approved CMP's request for permission to
undertake limited diversification into new lines of business in New
England and eastern Canada.  "We've done fee-for-service work and
consulting," said MaineCom president Mark E. Curtis, "but this acquisition
is a critical step toward our business objective."

Curtis said the combination of FiveCom's technical and marketing savvy and
its current facilities agreement make it a very valuable acquisition.
"FiveCom is a young company," he said, "but they've very quickly seized a
commanding position to compete in the carrier market.  We will fully
support their plans to build on that foundation and become a market leader
in the Northeast."

LOCAL COMPETITION: TIME WARNER COMMUNICATIONS ASKS PUCO TO INTERVENE IN
NEGOTIATIONS WITH AMERITECH

After a year of negotiations, Time Warner Communications says Ameritech is
either unable or unwilling to reach an agreement to interconnect its
network and it is time for the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO)
to get involved.

The company said that an agreement with Ameritech "must be concluded by
the parties, with commission intervention or by commission directive, by
mid-January 1996 or the promise of local telephone competition in Ohio
will be even further delayed."

Time Warner Communications made the request for PUCO intervention in its
second 60-day report to the commission on the status of interconnection
negotiations with Ameritech and other monopoly telephone companies.

Time Warner Communications has been negotiating with Ameritech since
December 1994.  "While the parties have clearly reached agreements on all
technical issues necessary for interconnection, the same cannot be said
with respect to the economic aspects of interconnection," the company said
in its letter to PUCO Chairman Craig Glazer.

Although the details of the negotiations are subject to a confidentiality
agreement, Time Warner Communications said that charges proposed by
Ameritech for some key services are excessive and that no cost
justification has been provided by Ameritech.  In addition, "Time Warner
Communications believes that it is not negotiating directly with those
individuals in Ameritech who can finally explain, modify and conclude
interconnection agreements," the report said.

It further stated that negotiations with Ameritech are most critical
because Time Warner Communications plans to begin offering competitive
local telephone service in Ameritech's area first.

The company said it has had only preliminary discussions with Cincinnati
Bell and recently began negotiations with GTE-North. Talks also are
underway with United Telephone of Ohio.

Time Warner Communications was granted a provisional certificate to
provide local telephone service in 37 Ohio counties by the PUCO in August.
Before it can compete with existing telephone companies, it must reach
interconnection agreements with them so customers can make calls to
anyone, regardless of which phone company they use. The PUCO also must
approve certain rules under which telephone companies will compete before
Time Warner enters the market.

Time Warner Communications is a division of Time Warner Cable that is
leading the company's entry into the telephone business.  It currently
provides local telephone service in Rochester, NY and competitive access
service in 15 locations across the country.  Time Warner Cable has four
operating divisions in Ohio serving more than 732,000 customers and
passing 1.2 million homes.

ATM: CASCADE ANNOUNCES SHIPMENT OF THE CASCADE 500 ATM SWITCH; ON-TIME
DELIVERY FROM THE WORLD LEADER IN FRAME RELAY WAN SWITCHING DELIVERS
UNMATCHED ATM SCALABILITY & GUARANTEED END-TO-END QUALITY OF SERVICE

Leveraging its leadership and proven expertise in providing powerful
connection-oriented Frame Relay wide area network (WAN) switches, Cascade
Communications Corp. Thursday announced that it has attained a
breakthrough engineering achievement through rapid market delivery of the
functionally-rich, high-capacity Cascade 500 Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM) switch.

With delivery timing as planned, the Cascade 500 has shipped to four
organizations for beta testing, including PSINet Inc. and LDDS WorldCom.
This marks the third delivery of a major system platform from Cascade in
the last three years.

Building upon Cascade's expertise in designing large Frame Relay networks,
the Cascade 500 delivers the industry's highest scalability and
reliability, critical requirements as the number of users on the Internet
and other wide area networks continues to explode and higher-speed

architecture and quality-of-service- capable routing software (via
Cascade's Virtual Network Navigator), the Cascade 500 delivers end-to-end
ATM quality of service, guaranteeing simultaneous network transport of
data and multimedia applications.  Seamlessly integrated with Cascade's
standards- compliant B-STDX multiservice switches and fully manageable by
CascadeView, the only standards-compliant WAN network management system,
the Cascade 500 provides a complete solution for cost-efficient and
easy-to- administer high-capacity networks.

"We are pleased that major organizations have not only recognized the
robust ATM capabilities of the Cascade 500, but also its strategic
system-level capabilities within their overall communications initiative,"
said Daniel E. Smith, president and CEO for Cascade.  "With the Cascade
500, we continue to deliver timely, best-of-breed products that meet
real-world customer requirements with complete integration with existing
network systems."

One organization testing the Cascade 500 is Internet giant PSINet Inc.
"With Cascade's B-STDX Frame Relay switches, we have experienced
tremendous success in meeting explosive demand for our Internet services
worldwide," said Martin L. Schoffstall, senior vice president and CTO of
PSINet.  "With availability of the Cascade 500 ATM switch, we will build
upon that success, leveraging the Cascade 500's unique quality of service
and scalability features for the introduction of exciting new
Internet-hosted multimedia applications, such as on-demand interactive
video and voice, and real-time multi-player, multimedia gaming."

"Furthermore, the Cascade 500 and the B-STDX's tight integration and
strict adherence to standards will provide significant service and
management benefits," added Schoffstall.  "From a service standpoint, the
B-STDX's Frame Relay-to-ATM Interworking functions will allow our
customers to seamlessly migrate to ATM without having to incur the cost of
globally upgrading to ATM.  From a management perspective, because both
the B-STDX Frame Relay switch and the Cascade 500 ATM are SNMP-manageable
by CascadeView, we will be able to add this next-generation technology to
our network environment with minimal training and deployment."

Designed as a 16-slot chassis system, the Cascade 500 is a non-blocking
ATM switch with a flexible 2.5, 5 and 10 Gbps capacity. It supports
next-generation speeds of 45, 155 and 622 Mbps and the industry's highest
port density on a single platform, supporting 56 OC-3c/STM-1, 112 DS-3/E3
and 14 OC-12/STM-4 ports.

"Our timely delivery of the Cascade 500 to four robust network
environments for beta testing proves the singular relevance of Frame Relay
expertise to ATM networks," said Chris Baldwin, Cascade's senior product
manager for ATM.  "Beyond the simple mechanics of hardware-based cell
switching, ATM is all connection-management software.  Frame Relay and ATM
share the connection-oriented paradigm.  Cascade's proven leadership in
Frame Relay connection management has given it a leapfrog position in ATM
system design, proven now by our Cascade 500 engineering-delivery
success."

PRICING/AVAILABILITY
With general availability in Q1 `96, the Cascade 500 is priced based on
system configuration, with entry-level pricing starting at $25,000 and

VOICE PROCESSING: ENHANCED SYSTEMS INC., A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF
VODAVI TECHNOLOGY INC., IN VOICE ACTIVATED DIALING AGREEMENT WITH GTE
MOBILNET

Enhanced Systems Inc. (ESI) has been selected as the vendor of choice to
provide Voice Activated Dialing (VAD) systems to GTE Mobilnet.

Michael Mittel, president of ESI, said, "We have been working closely with
GTE Mobilnet on VAD for the past 18 months and of course we are quite
pleased with their decision.  We have built a user interface that we
believe is second to none.  Also, our in-market experience has given us a
unique understanding of the nuances needed to successfully implement voice
recognition technology in a cellular environment.

"We look forward to continuing our close working relationship with GTE to
support their existing VAD systems and to provide systems they may
purchase in the future.  We have also begun development of next generation
systems which will offer a whole new range of features and service
offerings."

GTE made its decision after a thorough analysis from the leading vendors
in the voice recognition industry.  Dave Wasby, product manager for GTE
Mobilnet, said, "Over the past two years we were able to narrow the field
of players in the voice recognition arena to just a few 'best in class'
vendors.  Enhanced Systems was judged to be the best after extensive
in-market testing.  We are pleased to be partnering with a firm as
proactive and technically advanced as Enhanced Systems."

VAD allows cellular customers to use voice commands in order to dial,
simply by recording, then saying the name of the person (or speaking their
phone number).  The product also lets customers control their cellular
voice mailboxes simply by speaking work commands such as play, save,
delete, etc.  Enhanced Systems is one of the first manufacturers to enable
other vendors' voice mail systems with speaker-independent voice
recognition capabilities.

Enhanced Systems Inc., based in Norcross, designs, develops, markets and
supports a line of voice processing and interactive voice response
software products.  The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodavi
Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:VTEK) (VTI) headquartered in Scottsdale, Ariz. and
is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol VTEK.

GTE Mobilnet, headquartered in Atlanta, is a leading mobile cellular
operator in the United States, with the potential of serving some 72
million cellular and personal communication service customers.  The
company is a wholly owned subsidiary of GTE Corp., one of the world's
largest providers of telecommunications services.

VALUE-ADDED PROVIDERS FILL NICHE FOR BUSINESS
BUT IS IT REALLY EDI?

      Third-party service bureaus for electronic data interchange (EDI)
are a small, but rapidly growing segment of the EDI support industry
that can help smaller businesses comply with federal procurement
mandates.  But some industry insiders we spoke with cautioned against
relying on service bureaus to help you convert your business to
electronic forms.
      "It is not EDI when one is going from computer application to
hard copy and back," says Steve Young, EDI program manager at Mountain
View, Calif.-based Input, a research company.
      But such value-added services (VAS) can offer you everything from
government requests for quotations (RFQs) servicing to off-site EDI
third-party delivery to document faxing-to-EDI, if you know how to
evaluate the vendor and services you need. 

Finding the Easy Way Out

      Not everyone sees the service bureau concept as a good
alternative to doing it yourself, however.  The question has been
raised whether using service bureaus is even true EDI.
      Input's Young says the paperwork that VAS produce is moving
backward and causes more errors because the human element is
reintroduced to the process.  "The point of true EDI eliminates
errors," he added.       
      But VAS see themselves as filling a niche in the EDI spectrum. 
"Our role is to fill in the blank for small business so they are not
compelled to get EDI or use a value-added network (VAN)," says Ken
Kohler, vice president of sales for Comptech, a VAS in Amarillo,
Texas.  
      Kohler says he is amazed at the number of businesses he comes in
contact with that still don't use a computer.  "These are [thriving]
companies that are doing business with the federal government.  Now
they have to do EDI to win a new contract and where are they going to
go to do that," he says.              
      There are a lot of limitations to EDI regarding the sending of
specifications or design alternatives, Kohler maintains.  VAS, on the
other hand, can enhance a small business's reach beyond EDI by
offering the small-and medium-sized enterprise a multitude of
alternatives, other than just doing EDI with one or two clients, he
says.
      VAS break themselves out into different slots, particularly when
it comes to being a provider of government procurement information. 
Some do very little business with commercial companies, but all do
business with government contractors.  The EDI Connection in Torrance,
Calif., for example, specializes in the retail business.  Cathy
Mueller, its president, says her clients range from those with only a
fax machine to fully-integrated EDI companies that just don't want to
bother with going through the process of mapping transactions over
again.  "We are finding that there are more specialty retailers needing
EDI," Mueller says.            
      The most commonly-used standard for Mueller is X12 for its 850
purchase order, 856 ship notice, 997 functional acknowledgement and
864 message text.  
      Mueller says her company will be expanding its services and has
recently signed a reseller agreement with Datamatix for RFQs. 
Datamatix is a certified VAN with the federal government, located in
Plymouth Meeting, Pa.

Going for the International Market

      Trade Point's specialty is expanding trade opportunities by
giving companies international exposure.
      The Columbus, Ohio-based firm uses the World Wide Web to find
domestic and international markets for its clients.  "We show them how
to use research tools, such as Dun & Bradstreet, Price Waterhouse and
the Journal of Commerce," says Christy Bauer, general counsel for
Trade Point. 
      Cataloging company products is another way that VAS can assist
businesses to expand their exposure and to use EDI in taking and
receiving orders. 
      Neither Infomaze in Dayton, Ohio nor Ali Corp in Diamond Bar,
Calif., provide third-party EDI services to commercial clients. 
Instead, they are strictly government-service providers of RFQs to
contractors. 
      Infomaze has a bulletin board service for the U.S. Defense
Logistics Agency.  The Ohio company began its business providing the
information on paper, graduated to diskette and now provides the data
electronically.  
      Ali Corp. has aligned itself with General Electric Information
Services based in Rockville, Md., to offer its clients a VAN.  
      "Pretty soon, all the VANs will be interconnected and everyone
will be able to access information through a number provided by the
federal government," says Sam Saffari, chief information officer of
Ali Corp. 
      The largest growing segment of the VAS provider is the delivery
of RFQs, according to most VAS.  The delivery system for RFQs that uses
FACNET, the federal government's procurement network, has improved and
more government agencies are on board (EDI NEWS, Oct. 2,).  No one has
firm figures reflecting the increase in RFQ volume, but VAS tell us they
expect the volume to double over the next 12 months. (Christy Bauer,

SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE KEY TO OPEN EDI AND INTERNET USE

      Take a multi-track approach in migrating to open-EDI, industry
experts advise small- and medium-sized businesses.  Make sure your
evolution from traditional EDI involves the personnel and a technical
infrastructure that can support multi-platform programming languages,
such as Java, and advancements in intelligent agent technology, these
experts told EDI NEWS.  
      But don't get ahead of the game, they caution:  Movement to the
UN/EDIFACT standard from X12 won't be coming any time soon.  "You
can't do [EDI] across the Web without human intervention," says Shaw.
      That's the lay of the land painted for us as the new year
unfolded--lots of growth in EDI use is expected in the year ahead,
particularly as enterprises move to the Internet.  "A large number of
small- and medium-sized businesses are excited about EDI," says Jack
Shaw, president of the Atlanta, Ga.-based consultancy, Electronic
Commerce Strategies.  "Within two or three years, we'll see a large
number of [these] businesses using EDI across the Internet and using
open EDI."
      "We see great prospects for doing EDI over the Internet," said
Elizabeth Hudson, director of marketing for Concord, Calif.-based
Premenos Technology Corp.  "Although the Internet is still in its
infancy, we foresee a great acceptance of the Internet in 1996."

New Players

     Shaw sees a lot of new players moving into the market in the next
several months, to join the "old savvy" EDI providers.  He cited
Premenos (see related story, p. 8) and Dublin, Ohio-based Sterling
Software, as two companies that can be expected to take advantage of
how "the Internet will change the way EDI is done." 
     But not everyone is convinced EDI will grow, especially in the
banking industry.  "EDI is dead ... Not only have EDI implementations
flattened, they've trailed off," said Mike Alfonsi, who manages the
treasury consulting practice at Philadelphia-based Core States Bank. 
"We've hit a wall with the cost," he said.  Alfonsi anticipates little
growth in EDI at the current price of implementation.
    A consultant who asked not to be named, suggests "EDI is taking on
another form."  Moving transaction information electronically is
available through procurement card data, lockbox imaging and E-mail,
observes this consultant, who added: "Over the short run, no one is
going to make a lot of money on EDI."
    According to The EDI Group Ltd., based in Oak Park, Ill., EDI and
E-mail will be the fastest growing markets in electronic commerce. 
The firm's report puts the total volume of all business-to-business
transactions at exceeding $45 billion and growing at a compound rate
of six percent a year.
    EDI itself has been gaining in use over the last five years, with
an annual growth rate of 24 percent in the United States since 1990
when 12,000 companies were using EDI.  Today 100,000 companies use
EDI, according to The EDI Group.
    The EDI Group sees EDI growing at more than 20 percent a year and
is taking an increasing share of electronic commerce volume.  The EDI
Group cited the transportation services industry as increasing
electronic commerce expenditures 10.2 percent per year, with EDI and
E-mail accounting for most of the growth.  
    On average, the 15 industries included in The EDI Group's market
forecast are increasing electronic messaging by 8.5 percent.  Other
industries in the study included: Retail, manufacturing, health care
and insurance, government, auto/aerospace, chemical, wholesale,
utilities and financial services. 
    The total business-to-business document volume is projected to
increase from 45.5 billion in 1995 to 58 billion in 1999.  EDI's
growth is undeniable but still only a small portion of the potential
marketplace, analysts say.
    But the real action has been on the Internet where use has grown,
and continues to grow, at a much faster rate than EDI alone.  The
World Wide Web hit the scene in July 1993 with 130 sites.  As of July
1995, there were 38,800 Web sites.  At last count, the number of
existing Web sites was doubling every 48 days, said David L. Taylor,
vice president and research director at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner
Group.
    The EDI community wants to merge the Web's exponential growth with
EDI's utility to forge a ubiquitous electronic commerce solution.  If
EDI vendors can secure the Web to the satisfaction of corporate users,
the two technologies should mean easily available, cost-effective
electronic commerce for businesses of any size, the analysts said.
    "A large number of small- and medium-sized businesses are excited
about EDI," said Shaw.  "Within two or three years, we'll see a large
number of [these] businesses using EDI across the Internet and using
open EDI."
    But EDI's growth will be bolstered only if it becomes more
interactive and more Internet-friendly, industry insiders said at the
Electronic Messaging Association's annual Messaging Solutions Summit
(EDI NEWS, Oct. 30, p. 6).  There's still room, though, for
traditional EDI, says Shaw.  

Internet Security

    The race to secure the Internet for EDI use is changing the way
value-added networks (VANs) are offering services, encouraging use of
open systems, and sparking a firestorm of product development,
industry analysts told EDI NEWS (EDI NEWS, Nov. 27, p. 1).
    Users of the Internet are becoming more comfortable with security
products, and are watching how the federal government and private
enterprises are moving ahead in implementing electronic funds
transfers (EFT), product data and credit card orders secured with data
encryption, and digital authentication products.   "There has been a
lot of hype about the potential for break-ins, but now with recent
[product] developments, the Internet is viable," said Iang Jeon,
senior analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research.
    Premenos' Templar Certification Program, for example, allows EDI
vendors to incorporate Templar with their translation software to
offer secure Internet EDI.  Internet security companies such as
Premenos and Redwood City, Calif.-based RSA Data Security are not the
only companies realizing that Internet security is important -- though
they are out in front.
    Maynard, Mass.-based Digital Equipment Corp.'s Digital's new
Internet Services Roadmap also offers a set of secure Internet
services for users and service providers.  Other security companies
taking advantage of the growing acceptance of the Internet for
sensitive data transmission include Netscape Communications Corp. in
Redwood City, Calif. and VeriSign Inc. in Mountain View, Calif.

0135.)

APL STANDS FIRM IN VISION OF COMPANY AND PRODUCTS

    APL Group Inc.'s strategy for business is to insist on training
potential users on its electronic data interchange (EDI) translation
software products, to be sure they understand just how to use it. 
    Taking control of training has landed APL a profit margin of 67
percent in 1995 sales revenues over 1994 for this year and projections
for 1996 expect to be about the same. 
    "The strategy that has led us to such success is to diversify into
delivering professional services and education along with product
offering," said Stuart Sawabini, president of APL Group.              
    APL takes pride in its ability to provide EDI services to all
levels of users.  "The typical delivery of PC [personal computer]
products to the marketplace come from the Fortune 1000 company.  We
are able to offer strategic level EDI consulting and EDI
implementation services to the HUBs and PC-based solutions to the
supplier," Sawabini said.      
    Big manufacturing companies and government prime contractors have
benefitted from the government's mandate to use EDI for all
procurement processes.  It's the small and medium-sized enterprises
that need more support, Sawabini said. 

A Different Approach

    APL competitor St. Paul Software, based in St. Paul, Minn., designs
and sells translation software, but focuses on multiple platforms
beyond the PC.
    "The final function of what we do is similar, but the majority of
their business is consulting and they [APL] have a translator to go
along with it," said Larry Hastings, vice president of marketing for
St. Paul.
    Hastings said his company focuses mainly on the product and will do
consulting around it.  
    "We just have a different approach--they grew up in the consulting
business and we grew up in systems business," Hastings said.                
    APL client Heavenly Intimates, a manufacturing company in Mt.
Vernon, N.Y., has been using the company's Qualedi translation
software for three years.  "We use it as a front-end for
communications and translation," said Rob Rosenbaum, vice president
for operations.  
    Rosenbaum said he learned of the company at a Kmart suppliers
conference.  "I can process effortlessly 10,000 EDI documents
[transaction] a week," he said.  (Stuart Sawabini, APL Group, 203/762-

FDA TO HOLD JANUARY CONFERENCE ON EDI ADVERSE REPORT FILINGS

    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Devices
and Radiological Health (CDRH) is planning a conference Jan. 25 in
Gaithersburg, Md., to introduce its plans to develop an electronic
data interchange (EDI) system for submission of medical devices
adverse event reports.  The system will be called MEDIC (Medical-Event
Electronic Data Interchange Compact) and will use EDI to automate the
exchange  of "adverse reports"  between the FDA, health device
manufacturers and end-user facilities such as hospitals. 
Manufacturers and hospitals are required by law to file adverse
reports.  The conference will include a forum for industry
representatives to provide input on the MEDIC plan.  (Brenda S. Lucas,

DISA PUBLISHES MODEL EDI AUDIT GUIDE TO TRACK AND VERIFY EDI

    The Legal and Business Controls Work Group of the Accredited
Standards Committee (ASC) X12 of the American National Standards
Institute has developed a "Model EDI Audit Guide."  The guide is
designed to track and verify the trail through which a message is
transmitted from sender to receiver.  It addresses transmission
controls, translating software controls, information security controls
and usage of legal agreements regarding electronic data interchange
(EDI).  The guide provides information for evaluating control issues
that are unique to EDI and is meant to be used as an addendum to
existing application audit programs.  It should prove helpful for EDI
and MIS managers and others who desire a "high-level" understanding of
the objectives and requirements for auditing EDI, the Workgroup said.

PREMENOS CERTIFICATION CAN HELP YOU TO OFFER SECURE INTERNET EDI

    Software translation developers looking for Internet clients now have an
edge by becoming certified vendors of Premenos Corp.'s Templar Certification
program.  Premenos, a subsidiary of Premenos Technology Corp., started its
program recently to allow interested electronic data interchange (EDI) vendors
to incorporate Templar with their translation software, to offer secure 
EDI over 61the Internet.
    With the Templar Certification Program, customers who have implemented
EDI can utilize the Internet as an inexpensive, high-bandwidth form for EDI
communications, says Elizabeth Hudson, director of marketing for Premenos. 
"We see great prospects for doing EDI over the Internet," she explained. 
"Although the Internet is still in its infancy, we foresee a great 
acceptance oftthe Internet in 1996."  Templar is a suite of standards-based 
software, service and network
solutions designed to enable the secure transmission of end-to-end EDI
documents over open networks.  Templar software is the layer between the mail
agent, such as SMTP/MIME, and the EDI translation software to ensure
confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of both origin and
recipe.
    The first companies to participate are personal computer (PC) EDI
translation vendors Wilton, Conn.-based APL Group, DNS Worldwide and TSI
International.  The APL group is a translation software and services company. 
Its soon to be released Qualedi for Windows was the first to be Templar
certified by Premenos as a solution for PC users to send EDI over the Internet. 
DNS Worldwide, which provides electronic commerce software and services for
PC workstations, has integrated its EDI EDGE electronic commerce products
with Templar for Windows.

Internet Opportunities

    Hugh Stewart, DNS president, said that the number of companies that will
be able to conduct EDI over the Internet "will greatly expand by incorporating
our PC EDI translation software with Templar."
    TSI International, the leader in Windows-based software with more than 85
percent market share of that market, will offer Templar as a transport option
for its thousands of Trading Partner PC kits.  Connie Galley, president of TSI,
said that although TSI customers have always been free to make their own
communications choices, Templar gives them a "viable Internet alternative"
backed by a leading company.
    The certification program is available to vendors from UNIX, AS/400 and
MVS mainframe EDI translation software companies.  EDI software companies
can become certified in less than one week.  (Elizabeth Hudson, Premenos,
510/602-2000.)

PAPER CONTINUES TO PROLIFERATE
Users Disseminate, Then Print--Increasing Paper Use 

     Imaging is failing to produce the promised paperless office,
experts tell us.  Indeed, expanded use of information technologies,
such as imaging, combined with people's historic reliance on paper are
producing new mountains of documents to file.  "The misapplication of
imaging technology has fueled the use of paper," says Kerry Stackpole,
president of The Association for Work Process Improvement (TAWPI) of
Boston, Mass.  
     Information is easier to access electronically than ever before,
which makes it an easy target to print out constantly.  For instance,
by the year 2004, the pile of information available at the desktop
will come first in electronic form, compared to a 90 percent paper-
domination today, predicts Keith Davidson, executive director for
Xplor International, a Torrance, Calif.-based imaging educational
group.    
     There even is a laser printer paper shortage, according to
Davidson.  He predicts paper use will continue to grow at a rate of 10
percent annually.   
     Why does paper continue to proliferate, and what can you do about
it?  Electronic dissemination has confused users about how to best use
an imaging system.  The screens available on today's personal computer
(PC) monitors still make it hard to read a document.  Paper continues
to possess a very strong historical significance--both human and
legal.  Vendors suggest the following solutions:
     * View documents on screen only;
     * Print-on-demand;
     * Restrict paper use;
     * Use flat panel monitors; and
     * Employ in-bound faxes.

Electronic Dissemination Proliferates Paper

     Imaging systems were designed to reduce or eliminate paper use
across the enterprise--often by integrating images with an electronic
data interchange (EDI) system.  Documents were supposed to become a
digital representation of the paper version and move across the
enterprise easily, electronically.
     However, instead of using these systems to reduce the amount of
paper in the organization, users are continuing to print documents--
just at another stage in the process.  Where an imaging system could
provide essential workflow of images, users instead refuse to employ
this functionality of an imaging system, or use it "incorrectly," says
Stackpole.  
     The Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) also have made it much
easier to obtain information from universities, laboratories and
corporations around the world.
     "The new accessibility of documents, searching methods and
[electronic] filing systems are more efficient," says A.J. Rogers,
vice president of marketing for Wilsonville, Ore.-based Tektroniks, a
color printer manufacturer.   The point in the process where the
document becomes paper has shifted, says Richard Norton, analyst for
Norwell, Mass.-based BIS Strategic Decisions.  For example, instead of
printing the information and distributing it to real estate field
offices, the main office now is sending client information through E-
mail. However, when it arrives at the remote site, agents often print
out copies for themselves, the client and the office's files rather
than rely on the electronic imaging system to manage the document for
them.     
     "Rather than print at the source and distribute through mail or
fax, now information is disseminated digitally and printed at remote
locations," says Susan Hayes, manager of U.S. printer research, with
International Data Corp., a computer research firm in Framingham,
Mass.

Still Not Easy To View Images

    Another reason paper continues to proliferate is the poor quality
of computer screens.  
     While there are a few high-end monitors with very clear screens
available from vendors like San Jose, Calif.-based Cornerstone and
Ricoh Corp., also of San Jose, for the most part, it still is
difficult to read an image directly from a PC screen.  
     "[Screens] are still not the best way to view a document," says
Norton.  He said that most high-end computer monitors are expensive
and that their deployment in the enterprise tends to be low among
budget priorities.
    Wayne Buchar, platform business team manager for scanners with El
Segundo, Calif.-based Xerox, has been involved in the printing
business for 20 years.  He thinks paper use can be reduced, but that
it will take a much better, portable screen, easily visible in
sunlight to make it happen.  
    Xerox believes enough in the advancement of just such a screen
that its Palo Alto Research Center has been developing a prototype
computer screen based on flat panel technology.  This screen would
replace the typical glass screen monitor, says Buchar.  The new
display technology will have a 6.3-million pixel display, comparable
to a 600 dots-per-inch laser printed page, says Lois Wong, spokeswoman
for Xerox.  

Paper's History Makes it Popular

     There remains quite an historical attachment to paper, in part
for its tactile nature and its continuing utility to the U.S. legal
system, say the experts.  
    In fact, it is the older generation that often is unwilling to
adapt to an electronic imaging environment.  "It depends on the age of
the person whether [that person] will work on the document on the
screen or print it out," says Hayes.  "The need to have it in writing
is the law of the land," added Davidson. But, "imaging use is growing
within the courts," says Lynn Walker, analyst for the National Center
for State Courts, in Williamsburg, Va.  A few states have begun
allowing digital images in the courtroom, such as California and
Texas. 
    In fact, images are being used instead of paper in the courtroom
when tracking such information as witness lists and depositions, she
says.

Reducing Paper Still is Possible

    The worldwide installed printer base in 1995 equaled $22.7
billion, for a total of slightly less than 33 million printers,
including laser, ink jet and impact printers--such as dot matrix and
line character printers, says Hayes.  Laser printers made up $12.5
billion of that total, with ink jet printer sales $6.25 billion in
1995.  
    Davidson predicts that business executives may even restrict the
use of printing, including the number of interoffice mail messages.  
    Routine documents will shrink over the next 10 years as companies
begin to parallel the government's push to reduce paper use across
federal agencies, he adds.
    "We will continue to see fewer and fewer routine documents [on
paper], including interoffice memos," he said.  Davidson predicts the
last interoffice memo will say something like--"no more interoffice
memos."
    In the future, managers may restrict access to documents on local
area networks (LAN) unless they are viewed electronically.  
    "I wouldn't be surprised if people don't run reports that [the
user] can't print until after [the document] has been looked at,"
Davidson says.  
    In addition, print-on-demand is helping to reduce paper
consumption by encouraging users to print only what they need.  
    Also, in-bound fax has become more popular, with such companies
as San Diego-based Mitek Systems Inc. providing software that routes
in-bound faxes directly to the LAN.  
    "This may not do much to keep the paper off the [sender's] desk,
but it will help the [recipient]," says Stackpole. (Richard Norton,

Ways To Reduce Paper In An Imaging Enterprise

*  Determine ways components of your business can be reduced or
       eliminated.
*  Examine process relative to customers' needs--whether or not
       they are comfortable with or without paper.
*  Don't produce paper in the first place--view documents
       electronically.
*  Use modest solutions--they are available.
*  Look to long term success of imaging, not just short term.

Message Center Services is being offered over ARDIS, RAM Mobile Data
and cellular digital packet data (CDPD) networks.  The company also
introduced RadioMail Remote Control, which adds dial-up access,
cellular access and message management to the Message Center Services.
    Woodbridge, N.J.-based RAM is teaming with Megahertz Corp., the
Mobile Communications Division of U.S. Robotics, to make available a
new wireless, Type II PC Card.  The AllPoints Wireless PC Card is
designed to operate on RAM's Mobitex-based wireless data
communications service.
    Meanwhile, ARDIS, of Lincolnshire, Ill., is providing wireless
data communications for Apple Computer Inc.'s MessagePad 120 using the
Newton 2.0 operating system.

Cellular and Paging

    Cellular carriers can contract with RadioMail's Message Center
Services to add two-way wireless messaging services to their current
cellular and paging operations.  The two-way messaging services are
compatible with circuit-switched cellular and cellular digital packet
data (CDPD) networks.  The services support numerous applications,
including Internet-compatible E-mail, faxing, pager notification of
new messages and many message management choices to control wireless
communications costs and delivery.
     Mark Elderkin, director of marketing for RadioMail, said that the
company is using "products that people are familiar with already, such
as cellular phones and pagers." 
    RadioMail also introduced RadioMail Remote Control, which adds
dial-up access, cellular access and message management to the
RadioMail wireless messaging services offered over numerous networks,
including ARDIS and RAM.

Personal RadioMailBox

    Remote Control provides individuals with a personal RadioMailBox
and a mobile Internet address that can be linked to their pagers or
through their cellular phones or wireless modems, to their portable
computers.  Users can exchange wireless messages with anybody who has
an Internet E-mail mailbox and send faxes, send messages to pagers,
and monitor news reports and customized stock portfolios, said
Elderkin.
    The Remote Control service has a base price of $9.95 per month,
with connect time charges of 20 cents per minute.
    With E-mail, the company's "thrust will be increasing the amount
of control users have on messages," he said.  Remote allows users to
store and forward certain large messages into their home mailboxes to
be read at another time, Elderkin said, saving air time.
    ARDIS also announced new Mobile Office rate structures last month
for E-mail applications for mobile professionals that start today at
$19.95 per month.  Applications supported in the Mobile Office program
are messaging and E-mail solutions for local area networks, including
ARDIS PersonalMessaging and AirMobile Wireless for Lotus cc:Mail from
Motorola Inc. and Mail-on-the-Run from Greenwich, Conn.-based River
Run Software Group.
    Dan Croft, senior vice president of marketing operations at
ARDIS, said that the combination of hardware, software and air-time
pricing will benefit individuals who want to take advantage of ARDIS
to "access their E-mail and to send and receive messages on their
laptops and wireless communications from virtually any location."
    Apple MessagePad users also can use the ARDIS network to send
wirelessly and receive electronic mail, send faxes and access
applications and information, enabling mobile computing. 
    Newton personal digital assistants, developed by Apple and
Motorola, now may be equipped with ARDIS communications software for
the Newton 2.0 operating system.  Used with Motorola's Personal
Messenger 100D PCMCIA wireless modem card, the ARDIS network provides
MessagePad users nationwide with automatic roaming, enabling them to
manage business from remote locations.
    Software developers creating wireless applications for the
MessagePad can take advantage of ARDIS' Wireless Software Developer
Program.    

RAM Focus

    RAM is focusing its resources on five areas:  field service,
sales, transportation and financial and utility markets.  RAM
currently offers 92 percent service coverage in U.S. cities and is
planning to raise its coverage soon to 100 percent through these five
areas.
    RAM's and Megahertz's AllPoints Wireless PC Card combines the
Type II format with RAM's Mobitex-based service.  
    The PC Card contains a two-watt, built-in radio, giving users
nationwide wireless coverage.
    Janet Boudris, senior vice president of strategic marketing for
RAM Mobile Data, said that the card "will have particular appeal for
sales and field management organizations that are already experiencing
the business benefits of using laptop and palmtop computers to conduct
business." 
    Boudris said that these organizations are "already a step ahead
of their competition.  Moving into the wireless environment is the
next logical step for visionary companies who desire a competitive
edge."
    The AllPoints Wireless PC Card "leverages the strength of RAM
service, delivers superior coverage and battery life and utilizes the
versatility of the Type II Format, said Steve Smith, senior vice
president of marketing for Megahertz.  The "card delivers on all these
goals, giving users a practical solution component they can use
immediately."
    The Type II PC Card is about the size of credit card and slides
into the side of the PC.  Its size--old modems were the size of a
brick--and the fact that it's Mobitex protocol, make the card
advantageous for mobile users, said a spokesman for RAM.  "The size is
a killer," he said.
    The battery saver protocol shuts down the modem automatically
when there is no traffic.  The battery lasts an average of 30 hours,
the spokesman said.  (RadioMail Corp., 800/597-6245; ARDIS, 617/252-

TIPS FOR SELECTING A WORKFLOW TOOL

    Develop criteria for evaluating workflow software before you
start looking for a product, says Bruce Silver, principal at Bruce
Silver Associates in Weston, Mass. 
    "Shopping for workflow is not easy," Silver said recently at the
Bank Administration Institute (BAI) image show.  "The basic problem is
that all of the workflow vendors are trying to solve the same problem: 
managing, organizing and automating a business process.  [All of the
vendors] give different names to the same concepts, [offer] unique
[product] architectures and tend to baffle, rather than inform, the
buyer."
    In addition, it's difficult for end users to compare the
functionality of various workflow tools, Silver said.  Some workflow
products have a lot of functionality built-in while other products
offer a "thin layer" of software and a lot of consulting and
application development services, he noted.
    Another problem when shopping for workflow software is that many
products are less than a year old with few reference sites. Products
can be demonstrated, Silver said, but "many are too new to have a
track record." 

Keep the `Human Factor' in Mind

    The first thing end users should consider when shopping for
workflow software is the "human factor," Silver suggested.  "Before
you start looking at the data sheets or the technical factors, you
need to look at your own organization and your users and developers,"
he explained.  
    Silver recommended that workflow customers keep in mind the
skills of their system operators when evaluating a product.  For
instance, if the system will be used largely by clerical workers, look
for software that is "built for speed" and has tight controls on how
work is presented to users, he suggested.  Choose products with "free-
form" environments for managers and professionals.
    Tip:  Decide whether you will use system integrators, in-house
technicians, or ad hoc tools built into the software to design and
update workflow applications.  "Each of these different types of
developers is the target audience of different workflow products,"
Silver said.
    End users also need to consider the track record of workflow
vendors.  Silver recommended users evaluate vendors based on their
market standing, company history, financial backing and experience in
the workflow market.   
    Silver noted that the best way to measure a vendor's success with
workflow is through its reference sites.  Have vendors provide you
with a list of reference sites in your industry, a breakdown of how
their products are working at each site and a contact at each site. 
Be sure to ask reference customers whether you should contract with
the vendor or a reseller for on-going support. 
    Tip:  Look for products that are supported by several third-
parties, such as consultants or resellers, who offer features that
"snap" into the vendor's framework.  "Besides [offering more
functionality], this implies the vendor may be a market leader because
it is attracting third-party support," Silver said.

Don't Be Confused by Scalability Claims

    Silver warns end users not to be confused by vendors claiming
that their workflow software is scalable.  "Every vendor will say [its
software is] enterprise-scalable," he said.  "It's a meaningless
buzzword at that level."
    Silver recommended customers look at how many concurrent users
each vendor has installed.  "Few workflow vendors can point to
customers with 1,000 seats, all doing workflow in a high-volume
transaction-processing mode," he noted.
    Also, ask vendors whether they plan to offer software that can
support multiple servers.  "The next frontier in workflow is
distributing the workflow server to support remote users in branch
offices, using dial-up lines," Silver predicted.  (Bruce Silver, Bruce
Silver Associates, 617/237-6879.) 

Features To Evaluate When Shopping for Workflow Software

* Graphical workflow maps.  
    Every workflow tool has a graphical map, a visual representation
of the workflow that helps users make changes in the process.
    Silver recommended users look for graphical maps that clearly
represent the workflow.  For example, the maps in some workflow
products have icons that users can click on to see every possible
routing path that can come out of a step.  Other maps have icons that
can be dragged and dropped to alter the workflow.

*User interfaces.  
    Look for products that provide the same interface for all of your
workflow applications if you want to build applications quickly and
easily, Silver suggested.  These interfaces generally feature point
and click tools that allow users to rearrange image windows, list
boxes, status bars, in-boxes and action buttons with relatively little
programming, he added.
    On the other hand, look for products that "hide" workflow
applications if you want to keep the interfaces for your legacy
applications, Silver said.  
The downside:  These products require extra time and money for
programming.

*Deadlines.  
    Users should ask vendors whether their product includes a program
that is triggered if the deadline expires for completing a task or
beginning an item, Silver said.  Some programs move work to another
queue.

*In-baskets.  
    "In a clerical application, you might want the workflow software
to shove the next piece of work to the processing clerk, no questions
asked," Silver said.  "But in other applications you might want to
present an in-basket, which is a list of items [the operator] can work
on."
    He said some workflow products have standard in-baskets that
present data to help users choose their next work item.  Accounts
payable applications, for example, might list each pending item's
invoice number, amount and vendor name.  However, most workflow
products require users to program their own in-boxes.

*Process modeling tools.  
    A growing number of workflow products offer tools for simulating
the effects of workflow changes on an operation's productivity,
resources, throughput, cycle time and costs, he said.  These programs,
which can be run on a laptop computer, also detail the duration of
each task, the location of potential bottlenecks and the number of
employees needed for each step.

*Work management.  
    "Work isn't typically routed to [a specific employee], it is
routed to a particular job category or skill set, which can change
depending on who's doing that task each day," he said.  Some products
allow organizational models to be built into the software so if an
item needs to be routed to a manager, for example, the system knows
which manager oversees that type of work.

*Work tracking.  
    "This is incredibly important, but poorly implemented in many
workflow products," Silver said.  End users should make certain that
the tracking privileges in workflow products are available to system
operators, such as customer representatives, and not just
administrators, he suggested.
    Users also should look for products that allow operators to
search for work items by keying in invoice numbers or customer names,
Silver said.  "Few products provide this type of tracking without
additional programming," he said.  

*Reusable tasks.  
    Ask vendors whether they plan to provide reusable tasks, which
are programs that can be used in more than one workflow application. 
    Also:  Consider each workflow product's server platform,
databases, exceptions handling, messaging infrastructure, programming
language, forms handling, document support and routing rules.  (Bruce
Silver, 617/237-6879.)

COMPANIES CAN SAVE MONEY WITH SPEECH AGENTS IN CALL CENTERS

    Companies will be able to hire fewer human customer service
representatives by incorporating a natural-sounding automated agent
into call centers.  Unisys Corp. of Blue Bell, Pa., demonstrated its
Natural Language Understanding technology at the Retail Delivery
Conference in Atlanta recently and to DC during an interview.
    "In the top 100 banks in the United States, there are 80,000 to
100,000 customer service representatives on the phone lines now and
call volumes are expected to double," said Joe Yaworski, general
manager of the natural language understanding program at Unisys.  "Are
they going to try and find a better way or hire twice as many people?"

Mortgage System Uses Natural Language 

    Unisys first is rolling out a mortgage loan application system
that uses the natural language engine to "speak" to callers. 
Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio, wants Unisys to use the
engine to custom-build a bill-paying application, said William Randle,
senior vice president of marketing and strategic planning at the bank.
      Unisys also is working with three as-yet-unidentified banks to
develop and deploy the mortgage application.  A commercial product
based on the natural language platform will be available this year. 
"We are targeting banking because of the growth in call centers,"
Yaworski said.
    In Unisys' first demonstration, potential mortgage loan
applicants call the system, which asks whether they would like to know
about fixed or adjustable rate loans.  Once the callers select the
types of loan, the system will ask about other details, such as how
much of a down payment they have and how many points they are willing
to pay.  
    Callers can ask to be transferred to an agent at any time during
the call or can ask the system questions that the automated agent will
answer.  Unisys expects its natural language engine to go into a wide
range of applications eventually, Yaworski said, from the
telemarketing to the credit card industries.  Third-party developers
who want to create applications using the engine can buy a developer's
kit from Unisys.  Unisys will gain revenues from sales of the engine
needed to run those applications.
    Natural Language Understanding technology emerged from funding
that Unisys received for the U.S. Department of Defense in the early
1980s for a project to create technology that could analyze text
documents.  
    Unisys sold off its defense business last year but kept the
speech technology to market it to banks.  (Unisys, 215/986-4788;
Huntington Bancshares, 614/480-8600.)

BIG THREE TRY TO WIN MESSAGING BATTLE IN '96
Lotus, Microsoft and Novell Struggling For Dominance

     Look for a shakeout in 1996 as Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft
Corp. and Novell Inc. tussle over which client-server messaging system
will win enterprise hearts and networks.  Companies also can expect
the Internet to play a bigger role in corporate messaging strategies.
     The large messaging companies repeatedly have set ship dates for
the three next-generation client-server products due--Lotus Notes,
Microsoft Exchange Server and Groupwise XTD--with all of them shipping
behind schedule.  Only Lotus Notes is close to delivering a product,
with Release 4 expected to ship Jan. 10 (see story, p. 8).  Exchange is
due out any time during the first quarter of 1996, and Groupwise XTD
will ship in the second quarter, a Novell spokeswoman said.

What Effect Will Delays Have?

     Analysts disagree over whether the delayed availability will hurt
the products' popularity.  One school of thought holds that one
platform's potential customer will get impatient and move to another
platform in order to meet corporate needs quicker.
     "Everyone in this next-generation offering is late," said Gary
Rowe, principal at Rowe Communications in Roswell, Ga.  "[And it] has
opened up the market for vendors like Hewlett-Packard who had its own
OpenMail.  
     "They said 'folks are clamoring for a client-
server environment.  We'll take Microsoft Mail and cc:Mail front-ends
and allow them to work with an OpenMail back-end server.'"
     "I think a substantial part of Hewlett-Packard's current business
is based on users that don't have the OpenMail client but use these
other clients--so it has opened up the market for other vendors,"
added Rowe.
     Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hewlett-Packard (HP) also is winning
clients due to its ability to put together an E-mail system for the
largest of enterprises--an OpenMail system can serve thousands of
users and unite many disparate platforms.
     Another school of thought says enterprises will be willing to
wait to get what they want.  Microsoft may have an added advantage
here because of its hold over corporate desktops.

Some Willing To Wait

     "In the case of many companies, Microsoft is in such a dominant
position in a lot of markets, just announced [Exchange] causes a lot
of corporate users to put the end decision on hold," Rowe said.  "They
kept going with their file-sharing [systems] and probably are
suffering some pain based on it."
     Consultant Dusty Sykes of Vanguard Communications Corp. in Morris
Plains, N.J., thinks the issue was of more concern to the news media
than to users.
     "If Exchange had been ready Jan. 1, 1995, most users would not
have been ready for it.  They hadn't done the analysis and had no firm
idea of their needs," Sykes said.  But some analysts think Redmond,
Wash.-based Microsoft may have lost business by delaying Exchange for
so long.
     "Microsoft's non-shipment of Exchange and ... the continual
redefinition of Exchange ... has really turned off a lot of customers
and [as a result] they have been uncertain about Exchange as a future
electronic platform," claims David Marshak, vice president and senior
consultant at the Patricia Seybold Group in Boston.
     The industry will have to wait and see as Microsoft has announced
only that it will ship Exchange Server sometime this first quarter. 
Microsoft did release the final beta version of Exchange in December
1995, however (EMN, Nov. 29, p. 6).

Eager To See Exchange

     Even considering Microsoft's delays, analysts still wanted to
talk about Exchange more than any other emerging client-server
offering.  Sykes picked the release of the Exchange server as one of
the most important events in messaging that will happen in 1996.  
     "Notes is no further along in infrastructure than Exchange," he
said, even though Cambridge, Mass.-based Lotus is releasing version 4
and Microsoft has yet to show a first-generation system.
     Other analysts agreed that Exchange was a good product, but also
acknowledged that it is a brand new architecture for Microsoft.
     "[Exchange] is a real new paradigm for Microsoft," Rowe said. 
"It's certainly an order of magnitude better in lots of respects than
Microsoft Mail."   People will be generally pleased with the overall
functionality--it's a pretty solid offering."
     But Rowe still felt that "no one can touch Lotus Notes."
     As for Groupwise, analysts agree that it is a good product, and
Rowe says Novell of Orem, Utah, is "probably the farthest ahead in the
universal mailbox arena."  But these analysts wonder whether Novell
will make it through 1996 intact as a company and whether a buyout is
possible that will undermine its ability to remain a messaging player.
     "With Novell ... shedding businesses and with rumors about them
being acquired, there's a question about [Novell's] long-term
viability and the business decision [for companies] to buy Groupwise,"
Marshak said.
     Analysts expect Novell to have an advantage when the company
releases Groupwise XTD, because of the way in which Groupwise XTD
leverages Novell's Netware operating system.

The Internet Card

     Even with the three-way struggle playing out all last year,
analysts had to give the Internet equal billing in their reviews of
the big three messaging companies for importance in 1995.
     "E-mail as a category became subsumed in Web activity," Seybold
Analyst Marshak said.
     In fact, the Internet and the World Wide Web became popular so
quickly last year that Lotus, Microsoft and Novell were forced to
scramble to create Internet strategies that kept their unreleased
products current with market demands.
     David Zimmer, president of Pennsylvania-based American Eagle
Corp., singled out Lotus for having the most competitive Internet
strategy.
     "[Notes] will be really large this year for two reasons:  Lotus
is interested in the Internet and the Web.  With its new pricing
structure, it is cost effective and InterNotes lets me have a nice
secure Web server with which I can control who has access to what."
     Zimmer does not think the Web will take over from Notes, because
of Notes' powerful publishing and collaboration features the Web
lacks, as well as Notes' strong security.
     "People, because of their fear of the Wild West culture of the
Internet, block [their Web-based internal networks] from external
access," Zimmer said.  "If you can have something that provides a dual
purpose, that's ... better."
     Companies using Notes only need one network, Zimmer said, because
Notes' security features more safely protects internal documents from
break-ins.
     In contrast, Zimmer thinks Microsoft's Internet strategy, just
announced last month (EMN, Dec. 13, 1995, p.1), could have an "adverse
effect" on the growing industry because companies will wait for
Microsoft's bundled Internet server without knowing what kind of
quality they will get from the product.
     Companies, focusing specifically on the Internet and the Web--
namely Mountain View, Calif.-based Netscape Communications Corp.--also
will throw a twist into messaging, Marshak said.  "Netscape will
bundle E-mail services into its server.  If I were a large oil company
that had [Microsoft] Mail and cc:Mail, for example, should I migrate
it all to Netscape mail?"
     As a result of this type of enterprise thinking, different
applications are driving corporate decision-making, Marshak said. 
"Does E-mail stand alone--superseded by other decisions--or does the
Web drive these decisions?  Lotus and Microsoft are both companies
hoping that E-mail drives the decisions."

The Directory Question

     Analysts have the most difficulty predicting what might happen
with directories in 1996, although all agreed that directories remain
an area of concern.
     "The need for directory services gets more acute every year, and
the solutions get further away from being real," Marshak said.  "We
used to talk about directories that would find printers and gateways
and now we are talking about directory services which have to
encompass every individual in the world."
     X.500 is gaining popularity, but companies are not adopting it as
the answer to the directory dilemma at the pace the industry had
hoped.  Companies are not adhering to a strictly X.500 but building
proprietary look-alikes to solve the same problem:  how to simply
locate network information.
     "I think that before we think about the technology, we have to
think about what the model is we are looking at here.  We have to talk
about X.500 and look X.500 but I don't think they actually need to be
X.500," Marshak said.
     Several analysts cited Utah-based Banyan Corp.'s StreetTalk
product as one good and available solution, but weren't willing to go
much further than that.
     "[Banyan is] a player that people don't focus on as much as the
others," Rowe said.  "They are a major player in the LAN operating
system area.  They are probably somebody else that people should at
least look at if they are making a decision in 1996."
     Other companies analysts mentioned are Novell, which believes
that its Netware Directory Service is its "strategic advantage in the
X.500 space," according to Marshak.  Marshak also said that "IBM
[IBM], given that they now own Softswitch, will be a big player."
     Rose also mentioned some smaller companies that are building
standardized X.500 directories: Control Data Systems, Unisys Corp. of
Blue Bell Pa., Enterprise Solutions and U.K.-based Nexor.
     Until the major vendors seriously address this issue, however,
"there is going to be some slow progress," Rowe said.
     Although many efforts are under way, most do not think this year
will bring a solution to the directory dilemma.  "I am not optimistic
that it will be much clearer by the end of 1996 than it is now,"
Marshak said.

Public Policy Sticking Its Nose In

     Concern over public policy affecting electronic messaging also
prevailed in the E-mail community in 1995.  Organizations such as the
Arlington, Va.-based Electronic Messaging Association (EMA) spent a
great deal of time lobbying against legislation that would restrict
freedom over public networks and hold corporations responsible for any
offensive material individuals might transmit.
     "We got involved, not because we have any great desire to be any
great player, but because Washington became more aware of messaging
and other technologies," said Victor Parra, EMA president.
     The EMA's goal, with regard to messaging legislation currently
being considered as an amendment to the telecommunications bill (S.
652), is to protect children from obscene material and corporations
from having to take responsibility for what individuals post on
corporate networks.
     As the legislation now reads, any person who "initiates the
transmission of any suggestive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy or
indecent message with the ability to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass
another person would be subject to a $100,000 fine or one year in
jail," according to Parra.
     Corporations have what Parra called a "safe harbor," because
anyone prosecuting them must prove that they willingly left such
material on their networks after knowing it was there.  Still, the EMA
wants the amendment's language rewritten to more narrowly define what
material would be considered offensive.  With the negotiations on the
bill now being finalized, the EMA is concerned that time this year is
short.  (The American Eagle Group, 215/482-3881; EMA, 703/524-5550;

ALISA SYSTEMS INTEGRATES CITY OF SAN JOSE E-MAIL

     E-mail is not just growing, it is growing in a million different
directions.  Departments are getting E-mail at such a rapid pace that
the systems they install are not compatible with anyone else in the
enterprise.  Therefore, enter the E-mail integrators.
     Alisa Systems of Pasadena, Calif., is the E-mail integrator out
connecting departments within organizations and making them accessible
to the Internet, as it has done with the City of San Jose.  
     Employees did not want to abandon the E-mail systems they were
working on just to become compatible, says Gary Zouzoulos, an employee
of San Jose, Calif.  So the city investigated several different
systems that could integrate all of the city's current E-mail systems
seamlessly. The city's management examined products from several
companies, and also briefly considered Maynard, Mass.-based Digital
Equipment Corp.'s product, but concluded that it was too expensive,
says Zouzoulos.
     The two reasons the city of San Jose chose Alisa over its
competitors, according to Zouzoulos were:
    * it was the only company which could integrate WordPerfect at
the time; and
    * they liked its database approach toward message conversion.
     Alisa's AlisaMail is designed to create a central location within
an enterprise and connect the disparate   E-mail systems using the
native protocol of each system.  This makes each E-mail package appear
to the user as the user's native E-mail system.For instance, AlisaMail
is able to detect when an E-mail message is sent from a Lotus cc:Mail
system to Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft packages without having to
generate an internal address, Alisa President Don Cole told EMN.

Address File Helps Find Each Other

    In addition, AlisaMail's integration system includes a Master
Address file, which makes all users apparent to each other on the
system.  In other words, it is a sum of all the other directories in
all their unique formats, as well as the routes necessary to send the
message within the system.  
     This file is called OpenDirectory, Automatic Directory
Synchronization and Message Switch.
     OpenDirectory creates and maintains a master directory of all E-
mail users on the system by requesting directory updates from each
separate mail system.  When changes are made in one E-mail system,
such as adding a new person, modifying an address or deleting a
personal address, the information is transferred to the master
directory and used to update all the other directories, says Cole.
     Zouzoulos said, "OpenDirectory is still based on a proprietary
standard instead of an industry standard."

Integrator Preserves Unique Functionality

     AlisaMail utilizes a multi-port gateway which connects the
different E-mail systems to the AlisaMail Message Switch.  The gateway
and message switch act as a store-and-forward message hub, handling
the conversion of message formats as required by each individual
system.  The message switch preserves the functionality of each mail
system because it stores the message in its unaltered format.  
     This is particularly important when sending messages across the
Internet, Lou Sears, senior programming analyst with the city of San
Jose, told EMN.  The biggest challenge before getting AlisaMail was
lack of Internet access, says Sears.  "Each person would have had to
have their own gateway to the Internet, with individual administrators
for each, and the software to go along with it," he says.
    AlisaMail helps users to see each other as they actually are--
without having to communicate through multiple gateways and
complicated massaging protocols.  For instance, an E-mail messages
sent on the Reston, Va.-based America Online system might have a
"return receipt" attached to it.  If this message is sent to a Digital
VMX system, it cannot read "return receipt."  Therefore, the AlisaMail
would attach to the message the concept of "return receipt" so that
the user on the other end would know how to respond, says Cole.
    Alisa Systems gears its product toward companies with between
1,000 to 80,000 employees, says Cole.

City Just Had To Have E-mail

    When deciding whether or not to integrate its E-mail packages
across the entire city-wide enterprise, Zouzoulos says the decision
didn't turn on a cost/benefit analysis:  We just had to have it. 
"Before E-mail was just a curiosity and a luxury; now we depend upon
it."
    Other benefits to the integrated E-mail system include a
reduction in some paperwork.  "We are just at that curve where people
are using [E-mail] more to actually send electronic documents [to one
another] and not just messages," says Zouzoulos.
    Whenever the city is having problems, such as a complaint coming
in about a city function, "the phone rings off the hook," says
Zouzoulos.  "E-mail has helped to keep things running smoothly."  E-
mail is used mostly within the city organization, but people from the
outside can send in E-mail also, says Sears.  He considers the city's
E-mail system to be not only used as a "business to business" tool
within the enterprise, but also as a communication tool to the
outside, he says.  For example, people from the outside can send E-
mail directly to the mayor or other members of the council with
questions and comments, says Sears.

Issues Continued To Be Worked Out

    While the city of San Jose is satisfied with the work Alisa has
done for its E-mail systems, there still are a few things to be worked
out, according to Zouzoulos.  The city:
    * wants to be able to handle the new Microsoft Exchange E-mail
product and would like Alisa to support this along with its others;
    * would like the directory structure to be made X.500 compatible;
and  
    * wants smoother interface with the Internet.

EDIFY HELPS BUILD INTRANETS.  

Companies are using San Jose, Calif.-based Edify Corp.'s agent
software for the World Wide Web to build internal networks which
employees will access using computers, telephones, pagers or fax
machines.  Unisys Corp. last month purchased Electronic Workforce 4.0
to provide a self-service human resource application to its 36,000
employees worldwide.  Employees will access this information through
the "Intranet," or internal Web, that Unisys' human resources
department is building.  Telephone and fax access soon will be added
to the system.  Unisys is using Edify's software to allow resumes and
remaining vacation days, through the Intranet.  Electronic Workforce
4.0 will work with PeopleSoft's Human resources management System
(HRMS) to allow employees to update records either over the Web or via
telephone.  (Edify, http://www.edify.com, 408/982-2000.)

WITH INTERNET STRATEGY HERE, LOTUS SHIPS RELEASE VERSION 4

Lotus Development Corp. will be the first major messaging company to
market with its complete client-server messaging solution Notes
Release Version 4 which was expected to ship today.
    Notes Release 4 comes on the heels of Lotus' recent Internet
strategy announcement in December which tied Notes closely to the
World Wide Web.  Lotus will be bundling at no extra charge the
InterNotes World Wide Web server with Notes servers--InterNotes
formerly cost $2,995.  Lotus also added native support for Web
protocols such as hypertext markup language.

Notes Using Web To Its Advantage

    "This has shown that Lotus has embraced the Web," said Paula
Boyle, industry analyst at the GIGA Information Group in Norwell,
Mass.  "Its strategy now is more comprehensive than Microsoft's or
Netscape's.  Companies looking to upgrade to Notes 4 will find the Web
enhancements a major attraction.  Companies looking to adopt groupware
will find Notes the most comprehensive platform, compared to what
Exchange will have."
    Analysts said Release 4 will conquer one of Notes's biggest
challenges--its difficulty to administer.  
    Lotus is doing this by increasing the scalability of a Notes
server.  Whereby Notes Release 3 server could support up to 120 users
per server, Notes Release 4 can fit nearly 1,000 users on a symmetric
multiprocessing platform, said Larry Jones, group product manager for
client-server messaging at Lotus.
    "Clearly, if I can cut down on the number of servers on a mail
network it will be easier for me to administer and I will need fewer
administrators.  All of that cuts costs of maintaining and
administrating my network," Jones said.
    The Notes Release 4 server comes in single- and multi-processor
versions at respective prices of $495 and $2,295 and runs on IBM
Corp.'s OS/2 Warp and Microsoft Corp.'s [MSFT] Windows NT.  Support
for Microsoft Windows 95, IBM AIX, HP-UX, Sun Solaris and Orem, Utah-
based Novell Netware will follow.
    Lotus also rolled out Lotus Notes Mail, a stripped down messaging
client for Notes servers, last month.  The client costs $55 per seat,
and allows users to send and receive Notes Mail even if they do not
have full Notes capabilities.  The lower prices will make it easier
for companies to allow all employees Notes access.
    Users can choose two other clients as well: Notes Desktop, a run-
time version which costs $69, and can run any custom Notes
application, or full Notes which costs $275.  All Notes clients
include the InterNotes Navigator web browser, which allows users to
import web documents into Notes applications.  (Lotus,
http://www.lotus.com, 617/577-8500; GIGA Information Group, 617/792-
2572.)

SEARS STUDIES NETWORK
ALTERNATIVES FOR PCRADIO

  Sears Roebuck and Co.'s Product Services Division plans to
test the use of mobile data communications with a version of
IBM's new PCradio in about six months, says Stan Knipe,
executive vice president for product services at Sears in
Chicago. Knipe expects recommendations on how Sears should
conduct the tests, and what wireless network it should use,
from the division's systems people in about 60 days.

  Although Sears has stated its intentions to use the
portable computer from IBM, it can't begin hands-on work with
the product until it implements a new system to support its
field service operations, Knipe says. The system will allow
Sears to handle service requests through a small number of
regional centers, rather than through its 850 local service
centers.

  Call takers will schedule appointments with customers and
then transmit work orders to the local centers, from which
technicians are dispatched. "We have to have this software
system, and even the process changes that that drives, in
place before we're going to be able to feed and support the
remote access terminal type of thing," Knipe says. Sears
plans to roll out the new system nationally over the next 18
months.

  When the tests occur, they might or might not involve the
Ardis public mobile data network. In early 1990, soon after
IBM and Motorola announced their joint venture to form Ardis,
Knipe discussed imminent plans to test that technology for
field service applications (see our sister publication,
Mobile Data Report, February 12, 1990).

                    Tests Never Took Place

  The tests never took place, however, and now it's not clear
whether Sears will use Ardis, Knipe says. The company might
instead decide to use network facilities provided by Sears
Technology Services (STS) in Schaumburg, Ill.

  STS operates the data communications network for the Sears
family of corporations, including Dean Witter, Coldwell
Banker and Allstate Insurance as well as the retail
operation. It also operates three information processing
facilities -- in Schaumburg, Dallas and Columbus, Ohio --
which serve all the Sears companies except Allstate.

  The STS data network, which is based on IBM System Network
Architecture (SNA), uses special access circuits obtained
from local telephone companies to connect locations within a
local access and transport area (LATA) to a concentrator.
From the concentrator, data are transmitted to SNA boundary
nodes over 56,000 bit/second links, and from the boundary
nodes to host machines at the information processing
facilities at 56,000 bits/second or T-1. The processing
centers are linked by DS3 facilities.

  Knipe and a spokesperson at STS both decline to specify
what kind of radio frequency network STS could make available
to link the handheld terminals to host computer systems.
Neither will they discuss the details of the system that will
be used to link the regional service call taking centers, the
three information processing centers and the local service
centers.

  It's probably safe, however, to draw some analogies between
the product service system and the system Sears employs to
take catalog orders by phone. The 10 regional facilities
through which Sears will handle service calls are the same
ones at which it already operates its telecatalog service,
Knipe says.

  Telecatalog call-takers use "dumb" desktop terminals to
interact with host systems at the data centers. There is
considerable redundancy among systems at the three centers;
it is Sears' intention to be able to route applications
traffic to any of the three centers, depending on current
traffic, to maintain the fastest possible response time, says
the STS spokesperson.

  All data used in product service applications also resides
at the three central data facilities. Service representatives
use desktop terminals to access information such as history
of service on the appliance, whether the appliance is in
warranty and whether the customer has purchased an extended
service agreement. Under the new system, that function would
shift to the 10 regional centers.

  Adding portable terminals to the picture would allow the
local centers to dispatch technicians in the field to new
jobs. It would also allow technicians to close out jobs,
exchange messages with dispatchers, access technical
information about appliances and view schematic drawings. The
latter would not be transmitted over the network, but would
be stored on "a miniaturized CD-ROM," Knipe says.

  To handle data transmissions as economically as possible,
Sears expects to use a PCradio that can communicate over a
cellular network as well as over a public or private mobile
data network, Knipe says. Brief transactions would be routed
over the mobile data network. Large files would be
transmitted over cellular. (Of course, if Sears decides to
use privately-licensed frequencies rather than a public
network, it won't have to worry about paying by the packet
for transmitting large files, as it would on Ardis.)

                         In One Box?

  IBM is working on a version of the PCradio to meet Sears'
needs, Knipe says. But it's not possible to fit the hardware
for both cellular and mobile data network transmissions into
the same portable box, says Jim Robinson, the PCradio project
coordinator at Boca Raton, Fla.

  In August, IBM announced three versions of the PCradio.
Model 001 contains a 2,400 bits/second landline modem; model
002 contains a Motorola 400i packet assembler/disassembler
for use on Motorola radio networks, including Ardis; and
model 003 includes a cellular transceiver and a 2,400
bits/second modem for transmission over cellular. The
terminal can't accommodate both the 400i and a cellular
transceiver, Robinson says.

  A customer could, however, gain the ability to transmit
over two kinds of wireless networks by sacrificing some
degree of portability. For example, a customer could use an
RS-232 link to connect the cellular PCradio to an RF modem in
a vehicle, Robinson says. This would allow the user to
transmit over Ardis or a private network only while in the
vehicle, but over cellular from anywhere.

CONVERSION TO OMNITRACS
SIMPLE, SAYS U.S. XPRESS

  When Geostar Corp. declared bankruptcy this May, U.S.
Xpress, a full truckload (TL) carrier in Tunnel Hill, Ga.,
was left in the dark. But the firm isn't kicking itself over
the time it spent integrating the now-defunct vehicle
tracking and messaging system with its operations. Thanks to
development work it did with its Geostar vendor, Hughes
Network Systems in Germantown, Md., U.S. Xpress is now having
an easy time linking applications on its AS/400 network with
data from its new satellite communications system, says Jim
Clerc, data processing manager at the trucking company.

  U.S. Xpress signed a $5.3 million contract this summer with
San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc. for service on its Omnitracs
system. The trucking firm is currently installing Qualcomm's
vehicle tracking and two-way messaging system on its trucks
at the rate of 50/week. All 550 trucks should be equipped by
sometime in November, Clerc says.

  Under the contract, another 250 units will go to a sister
company, Southwest Motor Freight in Chattanooga, Tenn. Once
the Georgia company finishes its own implementation, it will
replace Southwest's current dispatching and management system
with its own software, including the Omnitracs interfaces.

  The contract also includes an option to purchase an
additional 1,000 Omnitracs units to install on newly-acquired
trucks in the future. U.S. Xpress used the Geostar network
for about 15 months before bankrupt Geostar pulled the plug
on its service. The trucking firm worked closely with Hughes
to provide interfaces to its own dispatching and management
software, which was developed in-house.

  U.S. Xpress uses vehicle position data to help automate
fuel tax reporting, watch for trucks that go out of route and
estimate fuel consumption, among other applications.

  If Geostar had not gone out of business, U.S. Xpress
probably would have been perfectly happy to continue using
the system from Hughes -- but no one at the company regrets
the relationship with Qualcomm either, Clerc says.

  During the weeks when the company was "dark" -- between
Geostar's death and the contract with Qualcomm -- the
advantages of vehicle tracking and satellite communications
became extremely clear, he says. The company has seen a 20
percent increase in productivity through the use of the
satellite systems, he says.

  Unlike many of Qualcomm's other customers, U.S. Xpress is
flying solo in providing links to Omnitracs. Usually,
Qualcomm gives new customers a shopping list of interfaces
and applications it can provide. Once the customer decides
what it wants, a software applications engineer employed by
Qualcomm writes the code needed to import data from the
satellite network into databases used by pre-existing
applications on the customer's host, says Jan Stevens,
manager of software engineering at Qualcomm.

  Qualcomm does a great deal of this "external applications"
work, but Clerc recently told her that U.S. Xpress wouldn't
need any outside programming help, Stevens says.

  Applications at U.S. Xpress run on a network of five IBM
AS/400s. One of the machines, whose main function is to
manage communications, is currently linked by a dial-up
connection to Qualcomm's network facilities in San Diego.
This will soon be replaced by a leased T-1 circuit, Clerc
says.

  U.S. Xpress dispatchers work on "dumb" terminals tied to
the mainframe network. The multi-session CRTs allow them to
work in three applications at once, moving from one screen to
the next without having to exit one program and enter
another.

                     Link to Southwestern

  One of the functions the dispatchers can perform is to
access Southwestern's dispatching program, running on an
AS/400 in Chattanooga. Although the two firms dispatch their
fleets separately, their computer systems are linked by high-
speed lines.

  A U.S. Xpress dispatcher with a new load to assign can
query the Southwestern database to determine whether that
company has a truck in the area that's better able to handle
the job than a truck in his own fleet. The link between the
two system leads to "better utilization of both companies'
equipment. We're competing against each other, but we're also
helping each other," Clerc says.

  As part of the integration with Omnitracs, the dispatchers'
terminals will soon give way to 80286-based IBM compatible
personal computers operating at 16 MHz, with 2 megabytes of
RAM and 50 megabyte hard disks. Having the PCs will allow
U.S. Xpress to use Qualcomm's Intracs software. Intracs
displays vehicle location data, downloaded from the host
computer to a PC, on computerized maps.

  Each dispatcher will use the map display to view the part
of the fleet for which he is responsible. Data will be
downloaded from the AS/400 at set intervals and when the
dispatcher requests an update. Ultimately, Clerc wants the
system to update positions in the PC each time they're
updated in the host. (Generally, Qualcomm transmits a
vehicle's position once each hour plus each time the driver
sends a message.)

  Although the advent of the PCs will put new processing
power on dispatchers' desks, U.S. Xpress doesn't plan to take
advantage of the added muscle when it designs applications.
The desktop machine, with its super-VGA screen, is basically
"a high-priced graphics display," Clerc says. "If the AS/400
could do it [run the map display program], we probably would
do that."

  Further enhancements to the system will follow when
Qualcomm provides U.S. Xpress with sensors, allowing it to
transmit data from engines over the satellite network. The
company currently gets some idea of how engines are
functioning by making calculations based on position data,
but that's "kind of guesswork," Clerc says.

  Eventually, rather than have its system simply display
engine conditions to dispatchers, U.S. Xpress would like the
computer to analyze the data and make decisions about how to
solve problems, Clerc says.

  Although U.S. Xpress will probably want to go its own way
in handling data from sensors, Qualcomm is preparing to
release a packaged application designed to make use of that
type of information. The Sensortracs program has been in beta
testing for some time now, says Stevens.

SYSTEMS LINK PLANNED ROUTES
WITH ACTUAL PERFORMANCE DATA

  Like the plans of mice and men, the best-laid plans for
delivery routes sometimes go awry. A firm might invest many
thousands of dollars in a routing and scheduling package that
uses sophisticated algorithms to analyze an information-
packed database. Overnight, that software might churn out
delivery plans designed to save fuel, use equipment
efficiently and keep customers delighted. But once the trucks
hit the road, real world problems -- like traffic jams,
overheated engines and errant drivers -- can play havoc with
ideal routes.

  To help bridge the gap between plan and performance, some
delivery organizations have been merging data from their
routing systems with data from trip recording computers. The
reports they obtain in this way at the end of each driver's
run can help them identify performance problems such as
unnecessary detours and missed delivery windows.

  In addition, at least two systems on the market today can
compare real-time data from automatic vehicle location (AVL)
systems with pre-determined routes to detect problems while
trucks are still on the road. These systems can calculate the
effect that a performance lag will have on deliveries later
in the day.

  They can then plan a new route to put things back on
track -- or at least to satisfy those customers with the most
stringent delivery requirements. Using a mobile data
communications network, they can automatically transmit
revised routes to computers or terminals in the delivery
trucks.

  Routing Technology Software, Inc. (RTSI) in Vienna, Va.
announced such a package this spring. The system uses the Ram
Mobile Data network to transmit location data from a Global
Positioning System (GPS) receiver mounted on a truck to a
host computer running RTSI's Roadshow routing and scheduling
package. For transmitting new routes and other messages to
drivers, RTSI is remarketing mobile data terminals from
Racotek in Burnsville, Md. and radio frequency modems from
Ericsson GE Mobile Data in Paramus, N.J.

  RTSI designed Roadshow primarily to address dense delivery
situations in metropolitan areas, although it also has
customers with trucks serving multiple states. The other
product that can re-route drivers on the fly, the Mobile
Communications System (MCS) from Rand McNally TDM in Skokie,
Ill., is aimed at over the road operations.

  MCS accepts location data transmitted over Qualcomm's
Omnitracs or Motorola's Coverage Plus systems (and formerly
from the now-defunct Geostar system). It compares current
locations with planned routes, alerts the dispatcher when a
truck is falling behind its estimated time of arrival (ETA)
and detects when a truck is out of route.

                       Visiting Shirley

  A driver on a long distance trip might go out of route --
using extra time and fuel -- because of road construction,
bad weather or "because he's visiting Shirley," says Henry
Feinberg, president at Rand McNally TDM. Once the problem
becomes evident, the dispatcher can have MCS produce new
instructions to put the the driver back on target. He then
transmits those directions to the mobile data terminal.

  The two systems seem to have tremendous potential for
certain delivery situations, but both are still unproven in
the marketplace. Although RTSI and Rand McNally are solidly
entrenched in the routing systems market, they're only now
starting to market their mobile communications products.
Neither has yet signed a customer for its new system.

  Are the benefits that result from comparing planned and
actual routes in real time worth the extra cost of using AVL
and mobile communications systems?

  Perhaps for some operations, but not for E & J Gallo, says
Monty Maglinte, an industrial engineer with the Modesto,
Calif. winery. Gallo is starting to explore how to combine
data from its routing and scheduling system with data from a
trip recorder. Gallo's distributorships, some of which are
corporate owned, use a routing package called Truckstops 2
from Microanalytics in Arlington, Va.

  Maglinte and his colleagues at Gallo serve as technology
consultants to the distributors. The firm is currently
investigating trip recorders they will recommend for various
functions, including comparisons of actual trips with routes
created by Truckstops 2. Like others who are combining the
two technologies, Gallo wants not only to measure how drivers
progress from stop to stop, but also to track other factors,
such as how long drivers spend at each account and how many
cases of product they unload per hour.

  If the software creates effective routes, there won't be a
lot of problems the dispatcher needs to address in real time,
Maglinte says. A truck might break down, or problems with an
account might cause a driver to spend an hour at a stop
instead of the expected 20 minutes. But those complications
don't arise often enough to merit great concern, he says.

  Technology that can produce and transmit revised routes to
drivers is great, but it's more costly than it's worth, says
Mark Whalley, transportation product manager at STSC in
Rockville, Md. STSC's routing and scheduling package, Trucks,
is designed for both local and long-haul fleets. Most of its
users are private carriers, Whalley says.

  Drivers who cover the same geographic areas day after day
know their territories well, he says. When they encounter
delays, they can figure out their own shortcuts and
alternative routes.

  There would be no extra value to getting performance data
in real time rather than at the end of a delivery run, says
Gary Strzelczyk, director of transportation at Bevaco Foods
in Pittston, Pa. Bevaco, a food service distributor, makes
runs to 13 states out of its central location. Drivers make
trips of one to four days, delivering to restaurants, health
care facilities and other institutions.

  Bevaco has used routing software from Roadnet Technologies
in Timonium, Md. for about 3-1/2 years. The firm has been
using trip recorders from Cadec Systems in Londonderry, N.H.
for the past two years. Roadnet is now working out the bugs
in an interface that allows the Roadnet system to accept data
from the Cadec and produce printed exception reports,
Strzelczyk says.

  At the end of each run, a Bevaco staffer extracts data from
the onboard computer by inserting a cartridge into the Cadec
and then uses the cartridge to upload the data to a personal
computer. Bevaco uses a floppy disk to transfer drivers' trip
reports, containing the times they arrived at and left each
stop, to a second PC running the Roadnet system.

  The customers that Roadnet serves don't need real time data
communications to monitor routes, says David Carp, national
sales manager at the Maryland firm. Unlike long-haul trucking
carriers, private delivery operations don't assign new stops
to drivers while they're on the road.

  "Usually if you're dealing with a beer distributor, wine
distributor, food service distributor, they're not getting
any orders during the day. It's all pack 'em up and send 'em
out and let 'em come back empty," he says.

                        Enough Hiccups

  For drivers who make many stops in a compact, congested
urban territory, however, the workday contains "enough
hiccups" that it pays to track their progress all the time,
says Donald Soults, president at RTSI. The routing
software/trip recorder combination is a good tool for
evaluating driver performance, but RTSI's real time system
can help companies anticipate and avoid customer service
problems, he says.

  Dispatchers can use the mobile data network to transmit
revised routes not only when drivers fall behind schedule,
but also when parts of the road system become unavailable. A
dispatcher who learns, for example, that a bridge has been
closed uses a mouse to click on the image of that bridge on
Roadshow's video map display.

  Once the bridge is selected and deleted, the software
calculates new instructions for any drivers whose routes are
affected by the change, Soults says. The dispatcher can then
transmit the changes to the drivers.

CUSTOMER GIVES THUMBS-UP
TO CLI'S FUEL DELIVERY SYSTEM

  Following a 90 day pilot on the Ram Mobile Data Network, MB
Trucking Co. in New York City is implementing mobile data
terminals in 20 of its fuel delivery trucks. MB is using the
terminals in connection with the Fueltronic 2000 dispatching
system from Carrier Logistics, Inc. (CLI) in Rye Brook, N.Y.
CLI used the recently-concluded pilot to refine the new
dispatching system before marketing it to other fuel delivery
companies.

  Fueltronic 2000 is based on the dispatching portion of
CLI's Routronic 2000 routing and dispatching package for
less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers, says Don Adams, president
at CLI. The new application, customized for fuel delivery,
was designed specifically to be used with a mobile data
network.

  MB Trucking delivers heating oil to private homes,
apartment buildings and commercial buildings in the New York
metropolitan area. Vendors that use its services include
large companies such as Texaco and Amerada Hess as well as
independent retailers. During the pilot, MB operated mobile
data terminals from Ericsson GE Mobile Data in eight of its
45 trucks. It has now decided to place terminals in the 20
trucks that do regular residential deliveries -- to one- and
two-family homes and small, brownstone-type apartment
buildings -- says Joseph Magnone, general manager at MB.

                   More Forgiving Schedules

  Because trucks servicing larger accounts make fewer stops
per day, they operate on more forgiving schedules, and MB
doesn't think they need terminals "just yet," says Magnone.
Also, because homeowners are less likely than commercial
landlords to plan for their fuel needs in advance, there are
more emergency calls for same-day service on the home
delivery side of the business, he says.

  MB has been using software from CLI for various aspects of
its operations since the mid-1970s. The trucking firm's
primary computer is a Unix-based IBM RT, which soon will be
upgraded to an IBM RS/6000, Adams says. Fueltronic is running
on an 80386-based personal computer in a multi-user Unix
environment.

  Customer orders entered on the RT are passed to the 386,
where Fueltronic routes deliveries, manages communications
with the mobile terminals and receives drivers' status
reports. When a driver reports that a delivery is complete,
the relevant data are passed back to applications on the RT.
The 386 is linked to Ram's local switch via leased line.

  MB expects to boost productivity and streamline operations
enough to make back its investment in the new system in a
year and a half, says Magnone. One area where it plans to
improve is in assigning deliveries for "will-calls" --
customers who call when they need oil, rather than scheduling
deliveries in advance.

  Using their mobile terminals, drivers will report the
amount of product dispensed at each delivery, and the system
will keep track of how much they have left. This means a
dispatcher receiving a call for same-day service will know
not only which drivers are closest to the account, but which
are carrying sufficient fuel. Based on those two factors, the
dispatcher can assign the job to the appropriate truck and,
if necessary, reassign one of that driver's other stops to a
different truck, Magnone says.

  By transmitting data on completed deliveries in real time,
MB also expects to eliminate many hours of data entry time on
the RT. Currently, with that information reaching the office
at the end of the day, during the firm's peak season the data
entry staff often must work until midnight or 1:00 a.m. to
update records. "We could be reducing our computer room time
by three or four hours per day," Magnone says.

                   More Announcements Soon

  CLI's Routronic 2000 package can be used with or without an
interface to a mobile data network. CLI is able to provide
interfaces to both the Ram and Ardis public mobile data
networks and soon expects to announce its first Routronic
customers on both, says Adams. AAA Cooper Transportation in
Dothan, Ala. implemented the system at its Atlanta terminal,
with a link via private network to Motorola terminals in its
trucks, in 1986.

  Since many of the functions in the LTL system apply to
other transportation situations as well, other specialized
products could follow Fueltronic 2000 to market. The company
recently completed a system for a client doing food
distribution and could sell that package to others, with or
without a mobile data interface, Adams says. Other niches
might include general warehousing and delivery, furniture or
appliance delivery and messenger services.

MELARD EXPANDS PORTFOLIO
WITH SERVICE ON RAM, ARDIS

  Melard Technologies Inc., a field service systems
integrator in Yonkers, N.Y., has added communications over
Ram Mobile Data to the list of services it will offer its
customers. Melard was recently appointed a systems integrator
for the Mobitex network operated by Ram, which is based in
New York City. Melard previously announced that it had signed
a joint marketing agreement with Ardis in Lincolnshire, Ill.,
This allows Melard to offer communications over Ardis'
nationwide mobile data network.

  The commitment to wireless communications is part of an
ongoing effort by Melard to reposition its business. The
company was established in 1983 to design, manufacture and
market handheld computers with communications capabilities.
More recently, its product line has included peripheral
hardware, such as barcode readers. Melard has carved a niche
for itself especially in the telecommunications industry.

  The firm has sold about 20,000 of its ruggedized handheld
computers, which use a proprietary operating system, says
Nick Scalera, Melard's director of market development.
Melard's current plan, however, is to provide turnkey mobile
information systems -- including hardware, software,
communications, training and support -- to a variety of field
service organizations.

  Offering communications over mobile data networks "is an
integral part of our business plan and always has been," says
Scalera. The right technologies at the right prices just
haven't been available until recently, he says.

                        Stymied by PBX

  Melard's product line has always included modems for
transmitting data over the public switched telephone network.
For many of its traditional customers, these have proven a
satisfactory solution. Technicians working for the regional
Bell operating companies (RBOCs) can always plug their modems
into outdoor equipment owned by their firms. But for
technicians working on other kinds of equipment, who might
have to ask a client's permission to use a phone, or might be
stymied by a client's PBX, landline modems pose a problem,
Scalera says.

  Melard's Access II product is a 2.4 lb., clamshell-style
handheld with 56K of internal memory allocated between RAM
and ROM and up to 512K of battery-backed RAM. The supertwist
LCD is available in either 8 lines x 40 characters or 16
lines x 80 characters. The 49-key QWERTY-style keyboard
includes 16 function keys. A 300/1,200 bits/second internal
modem is included. Melard uses a removable nicad power pack
to run the computer.

                      Engineers at Work

  Melard's engineers are working on how to integrate
Motorola's 400i radio packet modem into future products,
Scalera says. The 400i is compatible with Ardis as well as
with private networks using Motorola technology.

  Work on a handheld for the Ram network will have to wait
until a portable Mobitex RF modem reaches the market.
Ericsson Mobile Data in Paramus, N.J. is expected to release
an external model in the first quarter of 1992.

  In addition to its own terminals, Melard will also provide
other end-user devices, including DOS-based machines. If the
system that suits a customer's needs includes Melard's own
terminals, "that's fine; but if not, that's fine too,"
Scalera says.

  Scalera won't discuss whether Melard is working on its own
DOS-based handheld. But, "I would think at this point anyone
who would continue to develop proprietary kinds of systems
would have a very short-sighted view," he says.

  Although Melard has yet to sign a customer for service on
either Ram or Ardis, it has customers conducting feasibility
tests and has seen a great deal of interest. "All of the
people that we've been talking to, especially those that
don't have such ready access to tip and ring, have been
waiting for this kind of thing to happen," Scalera says.

  Melard isn't the only vendor of field service systems
that's convinced there's a big demand for wireless
communications. Although only the largest field service
organizations were looking at the technology in the past,
with the advent of public mobile data networks, smaller firms
are also showing interest, says Rebecca Weber, marketing
services manager at Service Automation, Inc. (SAI).

  The Houston-based firm provides management systems for
companies that service computer systems, residential
appliances, medical equipment, telecommunications equipment,
office machines and restaurant equipment.

                   Still Piloting Internally

  SAI announced a version of its Service Automation System
for use with Ardis in April. Although the company has begun
marketing the wireless application, it's still piloting the
system internally and has not yet signed a customer, Weber
says.

  SAI does have about 100 service technicians transmitting
data over Motorola's specialized mobile radio system, Privacy
Plus, which provides local communications. Although those
users will continue to be supported, SAI is no longer
marketing data over Privacy Plus because Motorola is no
longer offering it to new customers, Weber says.

  A third field service applications vendor, The Data Group
in Burlington, Mass., first developed the Remote-Plus
wireless communications module to its Field Watch system for
use with Motorola's Data Radio Network. That three-city
network was combined with IBM's nationwide Digital
Communications System -- which Motorola built -- to form
Ardis in 1990. Ardis is jointly owned by IBM and Motorola.

  Like its competitors, The Data Group has not yet signed a
customer onto Ardis. One customer has decided to use the
mobile data network but is still weighing the pros and cons
of various remote devices, says Robert Fogler, senior project
manager at The Data Group.

                 Non-"Bursty" Communications

  Some of the applications that interest field service
organizations, such as transmitting new job assignments,
closing out jobs and checking parts availability, are just
the sort of "bursty" communications for which Ram and Ardis
were designed. But other functions that service organizations
want to move into the field, such as accessing equipment and
customer history data and using expert systems to perform
diagnostics, could demand enough airtime to make public
mobile data networks an expensive choice.

  An applications designer can keep costs down by designing
data transactions that require as little network time as
possible, Fogler says. It also pays to use a computer, rather
than a "dumb" terminal, as the portable device, he says. This
allows the system to operate in a client/server mode; data
are downloaded over the network as needed, but most of the
processing occurs locally.

  Although paying by the packet to use an expert system may
be costly, a lot of customers say it's worth the price, Weber
says. "There may be enough value in what they can charge for
that [service] call that it's okay."

  Melard's tactic for dealing with large transactions will be
to provide more than one communications option in one device.
Customers using radio networks will still need landline
modems for moving large amounts of data, Scalera says. Melard
has also said it plans to offer data communications over
cellular networks.

BOSTON EDISON TO EVALUATE
STARTUP'S MOBILE DATA SYSTEM

  Boston Edison Co. is about to begin a small pilot to
evaluate the use of mobile data in maintaining its electrical
distribution network. After running this "prototype system"
for a few months, the utility will use the knowledge it gains
to write a detailed request for proposals (RFP) for a larger-
scale system, says Larry Dexter, senior electrical engineer
for communications, who works in Boston Edison's Waltham,
Mass. office.

  Using hardware and software from Metric Systems Corp., a
small startup in Acton, Mass., the utility will download work
orders overnight to Zenith laptop computers in trucks used by
line repair crews in Waltham. During the day, repair crews
will use the system to request more information about their
assignments, report on their status, close out completed jobs
and receive assignments for emergency work.

  Currently, field technicians spend 15-30 minutes each
morning picking up computer printouts that list their
assignments for the day. By having the assignments waiting
for crews on their laptops, Boston Edison hopes to get a jump
on the work day, Dexter says. Also, by automating the way in
which crews report on work they've completed, the utility
company hopes to cut the time they spend reporting verbally
to the supervisor at the end of the shift, he says.

  Boston Edison will be using Mavric 2000, a wireless data
communications system provided by Metric Systems. In its
basic form, Mavric 2000 consists of: 1. a base station
controller, containing a radio, an RF modem and interface
circuitry, 2. several remote controllers, which are similar
to the base station but are housed in more rugged boxes, and
3. communications software. Mavric permits both two-way
messaging (host-to-remote or remote-to-remote) and bulk file
transfer.

  "Messaging," in the vocabulary of Metric, includes
interacting in real time with a host system as well as
transmitting text messages, says William Brown, president of
the Acton firm. It also includes completing fill-in-the-blank
forms and transmitting the contents of those forms to another
computer on the network.

  In addition to providing the basic package, Metric is
working with Boston Edison to develop the utility's
application. One part of the project is designing forms the
supervisor will use to transmit work orders at night. Working
on an 80386 personal computer, the supervisor will obtain
data on pending jobs from the utility's work management
system, which is used to schedule jobs and control equipment
inventory. Metric uses a 3270 terminal interface to connect
the PC to the IBM mainframe running the management system,
Brown says.

  Once the supervisor sets priorities and assigns jobs to
work crews, the Mavric system will automatically "dial" into
the laptop on each truck and download the appropriate work
order file. The form describing each job will consist of a
section in fixed format and one in free text, Brown says.

  Data will be transmitted over privately-licensed channels
in the 484 MHz-487 MHz range, says Dexter. In addition to
detailing the work to be done, the forms will outline the
materials needed. Once they have their assignments, crews
will stop in the parts room to stock their trucks before
heading out.

  Boston Edison chose to download the large work order files
at night to help minimize daytime data traffic on the
channels, which are used for voice as well, Dexter says.
Crews will also use the radios in the Mavric system in place
of their regular voice radios during the pilot. Voice mode
automatically overrides data whenever a user picks up the
radio's microphone and starts talking, Dexter says.

  Concern about boosting traffic on voice channels will keep
Boston Edison from considering mobile data for dispatching
workers for another operation -- customer service -- in the
near future, Dexter says. Users of wireless data networks
often report that traffic drops when they replace voice
communications with more spectrally-efficient digital
messages. But since the channels are licensed primarily for
voice, there's a limit to how much data the Federal
Communications Commission will allow the utility to transmit,
he says.

  Boston Edison might consider the technology for customer
service, however, after it switches its mobile communications
to an 800 MHz trunked network in 1993 or 1994, Dexter says.
In addition to Metric, the utility plans to investigate
vendors of mobile data systems that can operate on trunked
networks.

  The pilot with Metric is Boston Edison's first time out
with a mobile data network, Dexter says. The company had
investigated the possible use of conventional mobile data
terminals in the past but found they didn't have enough
storage to handle the volume of data it wanted to transmit.
Boston Edison hasn't worked with any of the established
utility system vendors -- such as TTI Technologies and Dowty
Control Technologies -- that can provide dispatching systems
based on intelligent mobile computers, he says.

  Although the pilot won't begin for a couple of weeks, the
vendor and customer already anticipate a second stage that
would allow Boston Edison to attach diagrams to work orders,
Brown says. Computerized graphics representing sections of
the electrical grid would be stored locally on the laptop.
When a supervisor entered a work order on the PC, the system
would determine what diagrams the line worker needed. Then it
would remotely check the laptop to make sure it contained
current versions of the necessary graphics.

  If the laptop needed an update, the PC (now linked to
computer-aided design workstations as well as to the
mainframe and mobile data network) would obtain the necessary
graphics and transmit them along with the text portion of the
work order, Brown says. The details of how this would operate
have not all been worked out.

  Metric plans to use its work with Boston Edison, and with
other early clients, to develop a variety of customizable
hardware and software packages that could be sold to other
organizations. The firm is concentrating primarily on the
utility and public safety markets.

  Qualcomm, Inc. in San Diego has filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
proposing an initial public offering of 3,500,000 shares of
common stock. The company plans to offer 2,800,000 shares in
the United States and 700,000 shares internationally. The
offerings will be managed by Lehman Brothers; Bear, Stearns &
Co. Inc. and Alex. Brown and Sons Inc.

  Separately, Qualcomm announced a version of its Qtracs
software for IBM and IBM-compatible mainframe computers.
Qualcomm introduced Qtracs for IBM AS/400, System/36 and
System/38 machines last year. With Qtracs, trucking company
dispatchers can use Qualcomm's Omnitracs system to view

GOVERNMENT TIES TELSTRA TO DIGITALISATION TIMETABLE

Communications minister Michael Lee released on 17 January
details of network development undertakings negotiated with
Telstra which commit the carrier to six monthly milestones leading to
full digitisation of the network by 30 June 2000. The government
made a commitment to negotiating this network development deed
in September 1994, as a result of issues raised by the Casualties of
Telstra cases.

It commits Telstra to having 73.9 percent of lines in urban areas and
63.9 percent of rural lines digital by 30 June 1996. The number of
rural lines served by old ARK exchanges is to be reduced to 3.4
percent by the same date.

Calling line identification is to be available on all exchanges by 30
June 1997. CLI availability in rural areas is currently 89.8 percent
and in urban areas almost 100 percent.

Carrier preselection and itemised billing are to be available to all
customers by 30 June 1997, in time for the new competition regime
on 1 July 1997. Preselection availability is already a requirement of
Telstra's licence but the new undertakings provide a timetable to its
achievement. Preselection and itemised billing is available to
almost all urban users and will be available to 89.4 percent of rural
customers by mid 1996.

Telstra's compliance with its undertakings will be monitored by the
Department of Communications and the Arts in conjunction with
Austel and details will be tabled in Parliament.

On 28 November the Democrats communications spokesperson,
Senator Vicki Bourne, asked Senator Bob Collins, minister
representing the minister for communications and the arts, when the
government expected to release this network development deed of
agreement and why it had been delayed for over a year. Collins
concluded a long and rather vague answer by saying that "a
number of complex issues and detailed considerations have
needed to be dealt with in developing the undertakings. This has
been taking place in a rapidly changing environment that Telstra is
operating in which does have consequences for its business
strategies". According to Bourne's office he promised the deed
would be released "next week (ie early December). However the
Hansard record had it as "next month".

TELSTRA'S DISTRIBUTOR AND TARIFF PLANS FALL FOUL OF
AUSTEL

Tariff changes announced by Telstra early in December which
would have made non-value adding resale of basic telephone
service unviable have been blocked by Austel pending a detailed
investigation.

On 1 December Telstra announced its intention to withdraw the
Multisite Plan 1 (MSP1) and Callsaver 3 (CS3) tariffs. These had
been designed for large corporate users but formed the backbone
of many simple resellers' businesses and Telstra claimed this was
not commercially sustainable. Value adding resellers were offered
revised Service Provider 1 (SP1) and Service Provider 2 (SP2)
tariffs which Telstra claimed did not disadvantage genuine value
adding resellers. Callsaver 4 (CS4) and Callsaver 8 (CS8) tariffs
were also restructured.

The announcement provoked a strong reaction from the Service
Providers Action Network (Span) which, at a strategy meeting on 11
December, set up a fighting fund with $1000 from each member and
formed four committees to pursue its case: at the ministerial level,
with Austel, with the carriers and with the ACCC and on legal
grounds.

Austel announced on 22 December its initial decisions on the
filings. SP1, SP2 and the Freecall Flexiplan were disallowed.
Corporate Virtual Private Network (CVPN), CS4 and CS8, Business
Saver Plus, Corporate Centre Local and Long Distance tariffs were
not disallowed but without prejudice to subsequent Austel reviews.

On 9 January Austel chairman Neil Tuckwell wrote to Span saying it
had conducted a preliminary investigation of the CS8 tariff and the
result suggested that CS8 may be anticompetitive. It requested
submissions from Span members by 16 January to help it finalise its
determination.

Austel diasallowed SP1 because it bundled local and long distance
calls for discount purposes in a way which was not subject to
competition. It also offered no additional discount on local calls to
the retail CS10 tariff even though the SP1 user was required to take
responsibility for billing and bad debts. Austel also noted that SP1
discriminated against switched service providers, the entities most
likely to become competing carriers after July 1997.

Austel also expressed concern at the bundling of national and
international long distance services, fixed to mobile, 1800, 13 and
calling card services under CS4 and CS8 and said it would
examine these bundlings pursuant to clause 238A of the
Telecommunications Act.

Austel has also made a number of comments and
recommendations to Telstra and said it would pursue these matters
with Telstra early in 1996.

These include:

- recommending to Telstra that it give service providers reasonable
time to make adjustments to their businesses needed as a result of
future tariff changes, and that it should not use the intervening
period to compete unfairly.

- encouraging Telstra to develop a range of service provider
products which meet government policy objectives and the
requirements of service providers.

- encouraging Telstra to consider a wide area egress product for
switched operators "since there appears to be no operational
restrictions to this".

Span chairman Brian Perkins, in a letter to members on 22
December described the decision as "a great Christmas present
thanks to Santa Austel".

DRAFT TELECOMMS LEGISLATION RELEASED

The Department of Communications and the Arts made good on its
promise to deliver a draft of the post 1997 telecommunications
legislation, releasing it on 20 December as the Telecommunications
Bill (1996) and the Trade Practices Amendment
(Telecommunications) Bill 1996. The issued 148 page document
comprises the draft bills and commentary on each of them.

The drafts were based on 99 post 1997 proposals released on 1
August (Exc August 4, 1995). A new policy proposal provides for a
further full review of all telecommunications regulation "to be
completed in time for implementation in 2000".

The government also announced plans for technical self regulation
of the industry and simultaneously released an additional 38
proposals setting out its policy intentions (see below).
Communications minister Michael Lee said the new policy would
"align (Australia) more closely with international approaches to
technical regulation of telecommunications".

Not all provisions of the initial 99 proposals have been dealt with in
the draft legislation. It concentrates on licencing of carriers, codes of
practice, anticompetitive conduct and the access regime, saying
these are "likely to be the areas of most concern to industry and
where the earliest prior notification to industry is required to enable
preparation for further competition and self regulation".

The new Telecommunications Bill will remove almost all barriers to
entry into all telecommunications services but will limit the market
power of the incumbents by instituting access codes under which
they will be obliged to make their networks available to competitors.

The name Austel will be retained as the abbreviation for the
Australian Telecommunications and Spectrum Management
Agency which will be formed by merging the present Austel and the
Spectrum Management Agency. The SMA's responsibilities for
administering the Radio Communications Act 1992 will be taken
over largely unchanged by the new Austel. Telecommunications
competition policy responsibility will be transferred to the ACCC.
The new Austel will be responsible for carrier licensing, codes of
practice, assisting carriers to fulfil universal service obligations and
for oversight of technical regulation.

The Trade Practices (Telecommunications) Amendments Bill
includes a new part XIC of the Trade Practices Act which will
replace Part 8 (access by carriers to networks and services of other
carriers) and other relevant provisions of the Telecommunications
Act 1991. It also sets out a new part XIB of the TPC replacing part 9
(supply of basic carriage services by carriers) of the
Telecommunications Act 1991 to govern anticompetitive carrier
conduct .

Carriers will be required to join the Telecommunications Access
Forum (TAF) which will be required to produce a code of conduct for
access to carriers' facilities and resolution of disputes. The ACCC
will have a reserve power to override the TAF code.

However the draft bill has not fully defined the term access,
because, according to the commentary "the concept of access
covers a diverse range of things (such as) access to land, to
physical infrastructure, computer systems, billing services and
information, directory assistance and databases. Submissions are
invited on whether the legislation should include a precise definition
of the term access.

Separate legislative provisions will apply to service providers and
carriers. Anyone will be able to become a service provider but may
be declared a carrier by the ACCC against criteria set out in the
telecommunications bill. Any service provider with substantial
control over customers through its own switches is likely to be
declared a carrier, even if it does not own any transmission
infrastructure.

A carrier will be required to give undertakings to provide access to
its services and facilities in accordance with codes and standards.

As expected, pivotal to the new act is the distinction between
service provider and carrier. Carrier status is something that service
providers are likely to avoid rather than seek because it confers
considerable responsibilities and few benefits. Commentary to the
draft bill details the distinctions and the decision making process in
some detail.

A service provider will be anyone who supplies what is known in the
present Act as a telecommunications service, but has been
renamed a 'carriage service', or who uses a carriage service to
supply an online entertainment of information service.

A carrier will be someone who controls access to a network, ie can
prevent service providers from using that component for the
purposes of providing services".

The legislation also introduces the concept of a person's 'immediate
circle' to exclude what have been traditionally private networks from
being assigned carrier status. The term 'immediate circle' includes
state and federal government bodies, employees of business and
corporations and corporations related to another corporation "within
the meaning of the Corporations Law".

There is also a three dimensional geographic test applied to
communications networks. A point, whether fixed or mobile, is on a
network within Australia if it is on Australian territory, or in the
atmosphere below the stratosphere. Any point on a satellite and
above the stratosphere is outside Australia. The stratosphere
extends only to a height of 50 kms so all points on planned low
earth orbit satellites would be outside Australia.

The draft bills are open for comment until 16 February 1996.

TELECOMMS INDUSTRY TO BE SELF REGULATING

The government has proposed a regime of industry self regulation
of the technical aspects of communications and has issued an
addition 38 policy proposals setting out the new regime.

The additional proposals seek to harmonise technical regulation of
radio communications and telecommunications and minimise
government control over technical regulation which will be
"primarily addressed through industry self regulation involving
affected groups including consumers".

Interconnect standards will be developed by carriers and service
providers in conjunction with the Telecommunications Access
Forum.

Customer equipment and cabling standards will be industry
developed but "taking into account Austel/SMA's views on health
and safety aspects and on matters concerning the integrity of
telecommunications networks".

Carriers and service providers will be required to report on their
quality of service and performance against a code of practice
developed by the industry and registered with Austel.

Responsibility for accrediting conformance testing laboratories will
be transferred from Austel to a competent accreditation body such
as the National Association of Testing Authorities (Nata).

However Austel/SMA will have a reserve power to mandate
standards where appropriate or where self regulation fails.

Standards will be required to be based on international and
regional standards unless this is inappropriate. Carriers and service
providers will be free to develop their own network standards but
these must be co-ordinated with interconnection, customer
equipment and cabling standards.

The controversial Telecommunications National Code under which
the existing carriers enjoy protection from state and local
government planning requirements will be reviewed and carriers
will cease to have power to override planning rules.

TELSTRA OFFERS RADICAL SOLUTION TO USO PROBLEM

In the height of the traditional media 'silly season' (between
Christmas and New Year), major papers carried stories of a radical
proposal by Telstra to revamp the universal service obligation
(USO) scheme.

Telstra's proposals were submitted in November to the House of
Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and
Public Administration which was conducting an enquiry into aspects
of the national competition policy reform package. The terms of
reference for the enquiry included the impact of these reforms on
the efficient delivery of community service obligations.

Telstra's preferred option was for a radical reform under which
forward looking multi year 'contracts' for the provision of USOs
would be negotiated between a USO carrier and the relevant
government contracting agency. "The agency should be able to call
for expressions of interest in particular services in specified
geographic areas or markets after considering supply options,
demand for service and other market conditions...If the expression
of interest process indicated alternative supply options a
competitive tendering process would follow to determine the cost of
the USO (this) should be preferred as the most transparent
mechanism and the best means of encouraging efficiency in
delivery".

Telstra suggests that it should remain the carrier of last resort and,
failing the emergence of viable alternatives as a result of the tender,
the agency would enter into direct negotiations to produce an
explicit contract for the provision of services. Telstra recommends
that USO continue to be funded by a levy on other carriers.

The story was short-lived. The following day, communications
minister Michael Lee, in a radio interview, committed the
government to the present USO policy. Opposition communications
spokesman Richard Alston, normally very quick to fire off a press
release critical of any pronouncement by Lee, was also silent. The
issue is sensitive with rural communities and neither side wants to
risk upsetting rural voters in the run up to an election.

However in addition to the radical reforms highlighted in press
coverage, Telstra's 50 page submission to the enquiry listed a
number of issues which it said would need to be resolved if the
government preferred minimal reforms to the USO scheme. These
included:

- That the system creates market distortions which impact on service
pricing and delivery and which could hinder development of
competitive markets.

- That the USO system does not foster improvements in delivery of
services to rural areas and "there is very little incentive for other
carriers to examine alternative means of providing the USO".

- That the USO system does not recognise all Telstra's costs, there
are not direct links between carrier investment decisions and the
USO system thus limiting incentives for carriers to invest in USOs.

- Because auditors will not sign off on the contentious USO cost
modelling process Austel is required to finalise the cost "in
effect...audit the unauditable".

- Payments of USO contributions to Telstra have been delayed
because the system does not lead to timely closure of the costing
process. Telstra says it is working with Austel to improve the costing
process, but also calls for a dispute resolution process to enable it
to receive payment from other carriers more promptly.

Telstra also proposes a mechanism for evolving the definition of
USO in line with the growth of new services in other markets. It
submits that a service should be subject to USO provisions only
after it has become "widely used and socially significant in a freely
operating competitive market".

Even where an extension to the USO is merited on this test Telstra
argues that there should also be a formal evaluation of the
alternative uses to which the community's resources might be put if
the USO changes did not proceed.

FOXTEL/AUSTRALIS MERGER UNDER ACCC SCRUTINY

Australis and Foxtel hoped to close 1995 with the way clear to
completing the merger announced in September. However delays
in preparing the documentation for the deal and, more importantly,
the close scrutiny to which it has been subjected by the Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) leave the future of
the merger in the balance with legal action threatened if the ACCC
does veto it.

When the deal was announced the two companies said they
expected to put it to a meeting of Australis shareholders in
December and the ACCC had also initially indicated it would reach
a decision before Christmas.

A key factor in the ACCC's decision making process is whether it
decides that pay TV is a separate market or whether pay TV and
free-to-air TV should be considered as a single market. Optus
Vision has also argued that the merger would lessen competition in
the market for local telephony even though Telstra (50 percent
owner of Foxtel) has given no indication of plans to use the Foxtel
network for telephony and continues to cast doubts on Optus'
announced intention of offering telephony on its network in 1996
(Exc December1, 1995).

COUNCILS SCORE FIRST VICTORY AGAINST OPTUS CABLE
ROLLOUT

City councils opposing the installation of Optus Vision's cable TV
network from power poles in residential streets scored their first
victory with the Supreme Court in Victoria on 21 December granting
the council of Boroondara an injunction restraining Optus Vision
from further installations in the area until the case can be heard in
full.

Judge Barry Beach found that Optus had a serious case to answer
on possible breaches of the Telecommunications National Code
and also found that the exemptions granted by the
Telecommunications Act 1991 were so wide as to create
widespread uncertainty on their application. Council lawyers had
earlier argued that the code could even be used to exempt Optus
employees from road speed limits.

In NSW 16 councils are now participating in a joint action against
Optus Vision. Their application for an injunction will be heard on 12
March.

TELSTRA AND OPTUS TO LOSE PLANNING EXEMPTIONS

Telstra and Optus Communications will lose their exemptions from
state and local government planning regulations after July 1997. In
a statement issued on 20 December communications minister
Michael Lee said it would be wrong to allow an unlimited number of
telephone companies to be exempt from planning laws.

Austel's report on the Telecommunications National Code which
governs the carriers' conduct of their exempt operations was due to
be received by the minister at the end of 1995 and will be released
early in 1996.

The minister's statement gave no indication of any changes to the
code before July 1997 but with local government action against
Optus Vision's overhead cables starting to bite (see story above)
commentators have said that the minister should act sooner in order
to prevent Optus from being disadvantaged against Telstra's
unimpeded underground cable rollout programme.

Under the present legislation the planning exemption is conferred
by the Telecommunications Act 1991 with carriers required to
exercise their exemption in accordance with the National
Telecommunications Code. In the new legislation, clause 2207 of
the draft Telecommunications Bill 1996 ensures that all carriers will
have to fully comply with state and territory planning laws. It states
that "A power conferred by this Act must not be exercised in such a
way as to prevent the exercise of the powers or the performance of
the functions of government of a State, the Northern Territory, the
Australian Capital Territory or Norfolk Island".

This approach has also been criticisedby ATUG because it would
give local councils control over nationally important infrastructure.

JNA AND AUSDOC FORM MESSAGING JOINT VENTURE

Listed Australian companies JNA Telecommunications and Ausdoc
Pty Ltd have announced the formation of a joint venture company to
develop and deliver electronic messaging services. JNA will initially
take about 60 percent equity in the company which will be formed
from Ausdoc's recently established electronic messaging business
EDX.

The technical platform underpinning the EDX service was
developed by Ausdoc in conjunction with Digital Equipment
Corporation. According to EDX's chief executive Bob White, Ausdoc
has "an exclusive and perpetual licence to use the technology" with
Digital receiving royalties. JNA will merge the electronic messaging
resources of its Network Services division with EDX, to bring
"experience, products and technical strength" to the joint venture.

The two companies say they are looking for an additional investor
which could either be an institutional investor or value adding
partner. They aim to hold 40 percent equity each, with the new
partner taking 20 percent. Further down the track the two partners
say they plan to explore export markets for the service.

JNA became involved with Ausdoc initially by providing technical
and consulting services in Canberra. According to Ausdoc
managing director, Peter Reilly, the company identified a need for a
partner with expertise in electronic messaging which it lacked and
the joint venture evolved.

Ausdoc operates the DX document exchange service widely used
throughout the legal profession. It had $85 million sales in 1995 and
employs 780 staff and 250 contract owner drivers. It has two major
clients for its recently established EDX business: The South
Australian Courts Administration Authority and the Queensland
Government. The Queensland Government service is provided by
EDX under contract to Pacific Star Communications' subsidiary,
Sunnet Pty Ltd. It will link around 40,000 Government department
and agency users over the next three years via an X.400 backbone
linking existing mainframe and LAN based email systems. The
system is seen as critical to the success of EDX. It is estimated to
require about $2.5 million in capital funding before becoming
cashflow positive in 1996/97.

According to Reilly, EDX is able to offer a more focussed approach
to the electronic messaging needs of clients than competitors such
as AT&T and Telstra because large carriers lack the focus on
messaging which is only a small component of their business. The
company sees creation of communities of interest as a key to
success and aims to make services affordable and accessible for
small members of such communities, charging fixed usage fees
rather than per message charges and tailoring its service to the
specific needs of each community.

SPECTRUM NETWORKS ACQUIRES RESELLER, CONFIRMS
SWITCH PLANS

Spectrum Network Systems Ltd has announced plans to acquire,
subject to due diligence, the fixed network resale business of
Australian Wholesale Communications Pty Ltd (AWC), based in
Melbourne. Spectrum will pay approximately $1.5 million for AWC's
30,000 customers with total annual billings of $A50 million.

AWC will continue to act as Spectrum's exclusive agent for three
years and will provide Spectrum with administrative and
management services at a rate of approximately $130,000 per
month. According to Spectrum, AWC's customer base includes
"nine key trade organisations" and there are "further prospects for
significant billings and sales growth".

Spectrum also confirmed plans for the installation of its own
switched network "initially along the east coast of Australia".

The acquisition is likely to be only one of many which will rationalise
the service provider industry and in particular eliminate
organisations which add little value to the basic service. Spectrum
appears well placed to absorb these organisations because it has
installed a sophisticated billing system obtained from its strategic
partner in the US, the inter-exchange carrier Capital Network
Systems Inc (Exchange November 3, 1995). During December it
was promoting its billing service for other service providers with
large press advertisements.

EXPORT EFFORTS PUT STANILITE INTO THE RED

Listed telecommunications company Stanilite Pacific Limited
became the subject of takeover speculation at the end of the year in
the wake of reporting on 16 December that it was projecting a $11.7
million loss for the half year to 31 December 1995.

The company advised the Stock Exchange that it had revised down
its October 1995 prediction of $75 million first half revenues to $30
million, mostly as a result of delays in finalising export contracts in
North Asia, Europe, the Pacific and Middle East. Delays in issuing
licences in India have also delayed an anticipated $6.5 million in
revenue into the second half of this financial year. Difficulties in
Russia with telecommunications infrastructure have led to the loss
of an anticipated $10 million in follow on orders.

The company retrenched 86 'non-essential' staff in November (Exc
November 24, 1995) following a restructuring into three separate
divisions (Exc November 3, 1995). In spite of its problems Stanilite

two R&D syndication projects. An $11.6 million rights issue to

COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES CLUSTER FOR SYNERGY

Ausindustry announced on 20 December its support for a coalition
of Australian communications manufacturers formed to exploit
synergies between them. Communications Cluster of Australia Pty
Ltd (CCA) is a joint venture comprising Mitec, Stanilite, Scitec, TCG
Computer Aided Engineering Pty Ltd and Techcom Ltd.

The company has been in operation informally for three years but
with assistance from Ausindustry network broker Anthony Jarrett,
managing director of Mitchellsearch, has increased the scope of its
operations.

Jarrett said a marketing plan had been developed to promote the
cluster as "a single source, diverse capability one stop shop for
large and small customers, here and overseas...Indications from
their informal networking in the past suggest that CCA can produce
growth for each of its members beyond their individual capabilities".

Associated organisations include: Telstra, the TCG Group, the
Radiophysics Division of the CSIRO, Swiss Banking Corporation, R
Barel and Associates (accountants) and Creative Planning Centre
Pty Ltd (business planners).

In December, Exchange reported plans to form another
communications industry network under Ausindustry auspices.
Details of the network, Baltel are to be announced later this year
(Exc December 15, 1995).

WA DEMANDS MOBILE NUMBER PORTABILITY

According to a report in the West Australian last month (19
December) the West Australian government has specified that
number portability between carriers for mobile services will be
mandatory. The government has called tenders for provision of
mobile services through its telecommunications manager,
Commswest.

Austel said last year, in its report on number portability, that it was
committed to having portability available for digital mobile, 1800, 13
and 1300, 1900, 1901 and 1902 numbers by July 1997 (Exc July
28, 1995) but statements made by communications minister Michael
Lee in answer to Parliamentary questions later in the year did not
confirm this commitment (Exc December 8, 1995).

* In the UK the telecommunications industry has welcomed a report
by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission which says that
number portability is necessary for a competitive telephone market
and that BT and other operators should split the cost 70/30.
According to Telecomeuropa's Communications Newsletter, BT had
earlier rejected an Oftel ruling that it should bear the full cost of
implementing portability. According to TCN, BT has been
conducting portability trials since mid 1995 and has reduced cost
estimates for introducing portability as a result. BT says other
operators should be able to offer portability to new customers from
early 1996.

TELSTRA TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE INDIAN INVESTMENT
STRATEGY

Telstra is among foreign telecommunication companies which have
decided to alter their investment strategy in India following the
debacle over the awarding of licences to run basic services in 20
regional telecommunication circles.

On 1 January Telstra, along with significant industry players such as
AT&T and US West, failed to re-submit bids for basic service
licences. Only six consortia submitted bids for licences in five
circles. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) had earlier
re-opened the tender for 13 licences following the notification of
minimum bids prices.

Telstra spokesman Paul Rea, told Exchange that although India
remains a priority area for investment, DoT's minimum price of
$A3.2 billion for the Tamil Nadu circle was too much. Also, the
present uncertainties discouraged a resubmission for a basic
services licence. Rea said that "Telstra was not prepared to seek the
licence at any price". So instead Telstra would pursue alternative
investment strategies.

Telstra's alternative strategies include joining other international
carriers, with majority Indian partners, in managing basic regional
telecommunication services. Rea confirmed that Telstra has been
approached by foreign telcos to join them in partnerships; he was
not prepared to say which companies. Rea did point out that Telstra
has appointed a senior executive, Dr Sanjay Modak, to head up its
New Delhi office. Modak's appointment indicates that Telstra
considers India one of its most important overseas investment
areas, according to Rea.

Other investment strategies open to Telstra include building its
technology transfer relationship with India's centre for
telecommunications research, C-Dot, and focusing more on cellular
services.

The uncertainties referred to by Rea include the threat to cancel
government awarded licences by India's largest opposition party,
the Bharatiaya Janata Party which - not withstanding the 17 January
arrest of its parliamentary leader on corruption charges - has been
widely tipped to win April general elections, and eight separate
Supreme Court petitions which seek to invalidate the DoT's
authority to award licences. The petitions relate to the failure of the
Congress government to establish a telecommunications regulatory
body before opening the telecommunications sector to foreign
investment.

Meanwhile, Telstra looks set to replace the US' Vanguard Cellular
as an equity partner to Modicom Networks Ltd to run cellular
services in Karnataka and Punjab. The proposal comes after DoT
announced on 12 December that it had awarded 18 licences to run
cellular services in regional areas. If Modicom's proposal is
accepted it will likely encourage other Indian-led consortia to swap
foreign partners in equity arrangements for both cellular and basic
service licences.

OPTUS SHAREHOLDERS TIP IN ANOTHER $200 MILLION

Optus Communications announced on 15 December 1995 that it
had completed a $200 million rights issue to its shareholders.
Bellsouth, Cable and Wireless and Optus Pty Ltd in proportion to
their existing shareholdings of 24.5, 24.5 and 52.1 percent.
Shareholding in Optus Pty Ltd remains unchanged at Mayne
Nickless (49 percent), AMP Society (20 percent) AIDC and other
institutions (19 percent) and National Mutual (12 percent).

The rights issue brings total shareholder equity and loan
contributions to in excess of $2 billion. An attempt to raise $800
million from shareholder equity earlier in the year was rejected by
shareholders.

Optus had planned to disband Optus Pty Ltd in 1994 and make its
shareholders direct shareholders in Optus Communications when
the Nine Network was to take a stake in the company. It announced
in November 1994 that it had been given a Tax Office ruling to be
able to do so without shareholders incurring capital gains tax, but
this latest announcement shows that the move was never made.

TELECOM NZ PAY TV PLAN STYMIED BY LEGAL ACTION

The battle between New Zealand carriers Clear Communications
and Telecom New Zealand over pay TV escalated in late December
when Clear successfully gained an injunction preventing Telecom
New Zealand from proceeding on plans to conclude a pay TV
programming agreement with Sky Television.

Telecom NZ is planning to wire 6000 homes in the country's two
largest cities, Auckland and Wellington to deliver pay TV and
broadband services and has tried to gain programming through the
agreement with Sky. Clear had earlier challenged Telecom NZ's
plan to acquire the 25 percent of Sky shares held by its own major
shareholders, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech. Clear argued that such
an acquisition would create a dominant player in the telephony and
pay TV industries. Clear has not indicated any intention to enter the
pay TV or local loop telephony markets.

Clear lawyers were granted access to the confidential programming
agreement and claimed that it constituted a serious breach of the
country's fair trading legislation, the Commerce Act.

The injunction preventing the agreement proceeding until a further
hearing was granted on 21 December. Telecom NZ says it will
defend the action. Its share acquisition plan is dependent on the
programme sharing agreement, and so has also been put on hold.

ABA RELEASES ISSUES PAPER, INVITES COMMENT ON
ONLINE SERVICES

The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) released on 22
December an issues paper as part of its enquiry into content and
conduct of online information services. The ABA was instructed in
August 1995 by the minister for communications and the arts
Michael Lee to "explore strategies to encourage online service
providers and users to meet community needs, including the
development of codes, options for complaints handling, educational
programmes, devices for blocking and filtering certain material and
offence provisions" (Exc August 18. 1995). The 50 page paper
summarises community concerns garnered as a result of
consultative meetings with industry, government and community
organisations.

The ABA says that its consultative process revealed concerns far
more wide ranging than those about adult material and
pornography which have received widespread media coverage.
They included:

- the potential to widely disseminate material that vilifies people on
the basis of race, gender, sexual preference or disability;

- the intrusion of online services into people's privacy,

- the improper use or disclosure of personal information;

- the potential for defamatory material to be widely disseminated;

- the potential for infringement of intellectual property rights;

- the need to ensure that consumer interests are adequately
protected;

- the need to promote a better understanding of gender issues and
gender equality in the on-line environment;

- the need to ensure that Australian content is available and
promoted in an online environment to the same extent that it is in
other media.

The Office of Film and Literature Classification also undertook for
the ABA 27 hours of research searching the Internet for material that
would, in other forms, be restricted by its classification scheme. It
found such material to be less widely and easily available than has
been suggested by recent press coverage of the Internet.

Even after a seven hour search the OFLC was unable to find
material for downloading which would have been covered the
OFLC's category 1 and category 2 classifications governing
depictions of sex and violence in publications.

A copy of the issues paper (approximately 100kb) is available from
http://www.dca.gov.au/aba/hpcov.htm. Deadline for submissions is
16 February.

APRIL LAUNCH FOR TELECOM NZ INTERNET SERVICE

Telecom New Zealand is understood to have set April for the launch
of its Internet service. That service will also see Telecom NZ
become an Internet service access provider and it is also working
on content provision.

Telecom NZ is understood to be primarily targeting the business
market where it believes it can make money. It will try to lure
business customers by offering value added content such as news
services. It also believes that it has a unique differentiator in that
customers can be billed for Internet services on their Telecom
accounts.

Telecom NZ will also offer an access service to the consumer
market but believes the pay-off will take much longer.

The company is buying at least a dozen servers from Silicon
Graphics and is understood to have done a deal with Netscape so
that it can offer a customised version of the Netscape Internet
software.

Reports vary as to how much Telecom NZ is spending on the project
but $NZ50 million is seen by many observers as accurate. It is
understood that more effort is going into this project than into pay TV
moves.

This month Telecom NZ is taking over management of Waikato
University Internet gateway which connects to the USA via links
supplied by AT&T and Sprint. Clear Communications is also
offering services to domestic access providers through a BT link.
Clear will also offer separate frame relay links direct to MCI in the
USA. Adrienne Perry

ASTEC FORECASTS THE FUTURE OF THE CUSTOMER
ACCESS NETWORK

The Australian Science and Technology Council (Astec) has
released a customer access network foresighting study Surf's up:
alternative futures for full service networks in Australia. The study
was undertaken by Astec in conjunction with the Australian National
Training Authority and the Australian Photonics Cooperative
Research Centre.

The term full service network (FSN) is one that has only recently
entered the industry vocabulary. The report defines the FSN as the
successor of today's telecommunications customer access network
which will "integrate entertainment and switched communications
each with multimedia capabilities based on digital technologies. It is
only one component of the future network.

The 70 page report identifies "plausible alternative paths of network
development and the specific science and technology requirements
for such development. It looks at a time horizon up to 2010.

The report sees government initiatives as the major factor in
producing the favourable development of future broadband
networks and services and it makes 10 recommendations almost all
of which call for government action: to facilitate standards
development, market acceptance, lead the way in usage of new
services, commission further study into industry, security and access
issues, continue Astec's foresighting work and generally plan for the
growth of future services.

The report discusses at some length the most suitable technologies
for implementing the FSN. These include: hybrid fibre coax, fibre to
the home, fibre to the curb and ADSL. It lists a number of critical
variables that will affect the deployment of FSNs and attempts to
assess their relative degree of importance and uncertainty. Ranking
highest on both counts are the issues of consumer value and
consumer trust. Industry structure and human interface factors also
rank highly.

The report explores four scenarios:

- Widespread takeup of broadband and narrowband interactive
services by business and industry, but much lower penetration in
the residential sector.

- Widespread takeup by all sectors of the community, leading to
"significant changes in social behaviour, ways of doing business
and attitudes to use of computers".

- Slow take up in all sectors with conflict and confusion about a
multitude of standards and services.

- a disaster scenario in which a series of difficulties prevent the
rollout of a widespread full service network.

STANDARDS' DIGITAL VIDEO REPORT RELEASED

The Digital Video Services Task Group (DVSTG) set up jointly by
Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand to investigate and
recommend on standards development strategies needed for the
delivery of open access digital video services has released its final
recommendations

An earlier draft of the report caused considerable controversy
because it identified a clear need for standards in consumer
equipment for use on future broadband services and called on the
Government to mandate standards "where clear community benefit
is identified" (Exc June 30, 1995). At the time Standards Australia
played down the force of the recommendations saying the
document was only an interim for-comment draft directed at industry
and any 'recommendations' would not have such status until
comments have been received and a final report produced.

The final document, Strategies for the Development of Standards
for Digital Video and Associated Services identifies standards
urgently needed "to ensure that (pay TV) and future services can be
harmoniously introduced". It lists these most critical of these, in
order of importance as:

(1) Standards for customer access interfaces for both broadcast and
interactive digital video services with priority given to hybrid fibre
coaxial cables and satellite, MDS and digital terrestrial delivery.

(2) A standard for baseband analogue video/audio connection to
television receivers, consistent with international standards.

(3) Standards for baseband digital interfaces. These would apply to
digital televisions, multimedia personal computers with plug in
MPEG-2 decoders and digital video recorders. A digital interface
standard for remote control units with optional one-way control, or
two way interactive communications is also required.

The report recommends that all standards be based on an agreed
international digital video and associated services reference model
and it notes that the model developed by the task group maps
closely to that produced by the Digital Audio Visual Council which
was not finalised and not available to the group at the time it
developed the model.

Other recommendations of the report are:

- for a common scrambling algorithm

- a standard application programming interface

- a single customer identification addressing scheme, irrespective of
the service provider

- all existing Australian and New Zealand standards bodies,
technical committees and fora continue with their primary
standardisation and specification efforts under the unified co-
ordination of a single standards body with wide industry
representation.

Copies of the report, catalogue number SAA/SNZMP74-1996 can
be obtained from Standards Australia and Standards New Zealand
sales offices.

US OPENS THE DOOR TO MAJOR TELECOMMS REFORMS

Under a compromise deal brokered by US president Bill Clinton,
the House-Senate conference committee has agreed to deregulate
the US telecommunications sector agreeing to Democrats'
demands that industry concentration is countered.

Despite Republican claims that the proposed deregulation bill does
not go far enough, the legislation will see sweeping reforms that will
essentially end government barriers to the tie-up between long-
distance telephony, local telephony and cable television.

Analysts predict a series of mergers as the US telecommunications
industry becomes free to offer seamless information services. Nynex
and Bell Atlantic are already said to be discussing merger plans in
preparation for the deregulation.

Republicans accepted limits on the size of broadcasting companies,
but insisted on provisioning to slow the elimination of cable TV price
controls and make it more difficult for Baby Bells to enter long
distance enterprises. Price controls on cable TV companies will
remain only to 1999 and will end sooner if a competitor enters a
market.

In towns with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants, cable TV operators can
immediately raise rates.

Nynex will be especially favoured in the new laws and Bell Atlantic
and Pacific Telesis will do well because those closest to meeting
tougher requirements to get into long distance will have
advantages. The broadcasters, and especially News Corp will not
be happy. A single TV company will be allowed to reach 35 percent
of the US population but the FCC can cancel waivers letting Fox
Broadcasting go beyond 35 percent.

Rules forbidding a TV broadcaster owning a local newspaper or a
second station in one market still are on the books and the FCC still
will be overseeing Baby Bells (with input from the Justice
Department) as they seek to go into long-distance telephony
services

* The Federal Communications Commission said that the partial
government shutdown and bad weather along much of the US east
coast this week had forced the agency to postpone its 18 January
open meeting. The FCC has tentatively set 31 January as the new
meeting date to discuss president Bill Clinton's brokered changes to
the 1934 Communications Act.

Parker had been tipped as a successor to Telstra CEO Frank Blount
but Blount recently signed a second three year contract and Telstra
insiders have suggested that the lure of a chief executive's role

NEWS BRIEFS

* Prices for international telephone calls continue to fall with
Worldxchange announcing cuts on 8 January, in response to
Telstra's cuts announced on 1 December which come into effect on
1 February. Optus is also expected to announce substantial price
cuts before the end of January. Worldxchange, which has a flat rate
24 hours per day, now offers discounts of up to 50 percent on
Telstra's peak STD rate to the UK, USA and Japan, 41.5 percent to
Taiwan and Switzerland and 37.5 percent to Germany. Figures are
based on a call of less than three minutes. The company has
announced an additional special discount to Asian countries during
Ramadan (1-20 February) and Chinese New Year (18-28
February).

* Austel has released a for-comment draft of its technical standard
on end-to-end network performance (TS27). The standard will
ensure that all public and private telecommunications networks
carrying public traffic within Australia can support text, telephone,
fax and popular dial up modem applications at data rates up to
2400 bits/sec. It also specifies performance of low to medium rate
data applications such as telephone typewriters for the hearing
impaired. The standard was first issued in June 1994, but
addressed only performance standards for voice calls. Comments
are required by 28 February 1996. Copies of the draft can be
obtained from Standards Australia sales offices. (14/12/95)

* Plans to hold the first International Telecommunications Users
Group conference and exhibition in Asia, in Shanghai in 1996, have
fallen through. The exhibition and conference was to have been
organised on Intug's behalf by Total Concept Exhibitions of Sydney.
Total Concept wrote to interested parties at the end of November
1995 saying that the planned location in Shanghai would be
unavailable in time. Peter Braun of TCE told Exchange this week
that the company was now looking to work with the Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade to participate in the New Horizons event
in New Delhi in November and was looking to have the conference
sponsored by the Asia Oceania Electronic Messaging Association
instead of Intug.

* Austel's Technical Standard 002 has been altered to require all
incoming voice calls on a PABX to be either answered by a
recorded voice announcement, or else not connected. The
amendment follows a consumer complaint which found callers have
been charged for dialling an engaged signal on PABXs (12/95).

* A voluntary standard to inform consumers about the government's
policy on the phaseout of analogue mobile services by 1 January
2000 has been agreed by Austel and mobile telephone industry
representatives. Austel member, Sue Harlow, said that Austel would
monitor the effectiveness of the voluntary standard and would
consider mandatory standards if it is not successful. (11/1/96)

* Telecommunications reseller First Netcomm Pty Ltd has been
instructed by the ACCC to make refunds to customers because it
had given them misleading advice about the savings they would
make if they transferred their telephone service to First Netcomm.
The company was using multilevel marketing techniques to sell its
services and the ACCC also found that it had mislead its distributors
about the amount of income they could earn. They were told they
could earn up to $20,000 per month but "by the end of October
1995, the most that had been made by any distributor in one month
was $411".

* Austel has released a for-comment draft of a technical standard
(TS29) covering telecommunications charging and billing. It sets
minimum performance levels for both carrier and service provider
billing systems and "is intended to provide a framework for
monitoring the quality of those systems. For digital networks using
software billing it proposes maximum errors of no more than 22
calls in 100,000 to be charged incorrectly and no more than one
charge for an unmade call for every 200,000 calls. Errors in call
duration are limited to six in 100,000 calls. Submissions are due by
28 February. Copies of the draft can be obtained from Standards
Australia sales offices. (20/12/95)

* Telstra has awarded a major contract to Boston Technology of the
US to supply messaging systems for the GSM and analogue mobile
networks. Boston said it would supply "numerous" Access TP
network services platforms to Mobilenet to support a range of
services for Messagebank customers including call answering,
voice messaging, fax messaging, short message service and
paging alert. "Additional enhanced services will be offered via these
platforms in the future", according to Boston. Telstra will retain its
supply agreements with other vendors.

* In the National Business Bulletin's 1995 Corporate Image Survey
Ericsson improved its ranking in the telecommunications and
telephone systems categories. It came in third in the
telecommunications and telephone systems categories after Telstra
and Optus and ahead of NEC (4) and Vodafone (5). Alcatel fell from
sixth to tenth position. In telephone systems Ericsson pushed NEC
into third position coming in second after Telstra. However it failed
to make the top 10 in mobile phones, where the top five ranking
from one to five was: Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Telstra and Optus.
Nokia, the magazine reported, was the big surprise rising from fifth
position and pushing Telstra and Optus down.

* Inmarsat has appointed UK advertising agency Publicis as its
global advertising agency charged with establishing Inmarsat as a
brand among target audiences internationally. The head of Publicis'
international division, Joanna Baldwin, described the project as
"converting one of the world's best kept secrets into a global brand".

* The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)
has released a guide to Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act, which
covers access to essential services. "Part IIIA introduces a new field
of regulatory responsibilities and access rights which will have
significant impact on the provision of services that are critical to
competition in related areas", according to ACCC chairman, Allan
Fels. Phone (06) 264 2808 for details (19/12/95).

* Low-orbit communications satellites will be launched from
Woomera in South Australia within 18 months after an agreement
between STC Complex of Russia and the engineering division of
the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC), according to Senator
Chris Schacht. Schacht said on 13 January that ASC had signed a
letter of intent with STC Complex to set down a business plan for a
commercial Australian space launch service in which ASC
Engineering will manufacture satellite launch support equipment
and provide project management and systems integration with the
Russian company supplying the START family launch vehicles.
STC Complex was established by the Moscow Institute of Heat
Technology, the company which developed three generations of
Russian mobile rockets.

* Vodafone claims that it now offers the world's largest global
roaming network with 38 participating countries, including 18
countries with automatic global roaming facilities. Vodafone's
managing director, John Rohan, said that New Zealand was the
latest addition to the global network and that several more countries
would be added to the network during 1996. (12/1/96)

* Vodac and Apple Computer have released an integrated package
for mobile access to office databases and the Internet. The Vodac
Data Solution ties Apple's Newton Messagepad 120 GSM
connectivity to Vodafone's mobile digital network using a Nokia
2110 mobile phone, a Nokia cellular data card, Winfax Pro 4.0
communications software and a PCMCIA slot for a portable
computer. (9/1/96)

* Datacraft Ltd's Latin American subsidiary has received $7 million
worth of orders from Columbia, Mexico and Brazil in the first half of
the current fiscal year, according to George Kepper, executive chair
of Datacraft Ltd. Kepper said that major projects which Datacraft is
now supplying include a national paging network in Mexico, high-
speed network access and switching systems for two
telecommunication companies in Brazil and supply contracts to
Telecom Columbia. (8/1/96)

* Link Telecommunications and the South Australian Economic
Development Authority have jointly announced plans for Link's fifth
call centre. The Adelaide centre will employ 400 people and is
expected to handle over 12 million calls in its first year, according to
Terry Winters, the managing director of Link. Winters said that Link's
messaging business is currently growing at 35 percent per year and
that during 1995 the company handled around 50 million calls and
a further 20 million from direct access clients.

* New standards for the global information highway have been
approved by the ITU. A revised text of Recommendation G.707,
which includes G.708 and G.709 has been approved at the study
group level. Recommendations include setting standards for:
transport networks, including bit-rates, frame structure for SDH
networks and network management; audiovisual systems, including
protocols and coding for visual telephony; and for ATM equipment.
(5/1/96)

* The Telecommunications Development Advisory Board (TDAB) of
the ITU has called for clear strategies to attract more partners to the
development activities of the telecommunications sector and the
development of a strategy for the application of interactive television
in developing countries. The Director of the Telecommunications
Development Bureau, Ahmed Laouyane, told a December meeting
of the TDAB that strategic partnership and mobilisation of resources
were crucial to the success of the telecommunications sector.
(5/1/96)

* Mobile service provider Digicall Group claims a 75 percent rise in
subscriber numbers in the December quarter to more than 61,000,
from about 35,000 in the previous three months. This is an increase
of over 26,000 for the three month period, compared to just 2,956
net additions for the same quarter last year, or 16,000 net additions
for 1995. However, billing revenues grew by only 62 percent over
the final quarter to $9.7 million. Digicall's profit before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals increased by 200
percent on the previous quarter to $1.32 million. Digicall opened 30
shops during December and plans to open another 15 early in
1996.

* Telstra and Bay Networks Australia have signed an enhanced
distribution channel (EDC) partnership which will provide a joint
commercial venture for a tightly-integrated set of products and
services to specific vertical markets, according to Steve Wood,
regional director for Bay Networks. Under the EDC Bay Networks
will provide products for Telstra's networking and data services,
WAN and remote access. (8/1/96)

* Advance Bank has claimed an Australian first by offering its
customers access to their accounts through the Internet. All
customer information is encrypted for transmission in both directions
using Techway locally built software. In November Exchange
foreshadowed that Web Australia, a division of Techway, would
soon announce the first customer for its Catalogue Server using
RSA and IDEA v2.2 software (Exc November 24, 1995).

* The Telecommunications Ombudsman, John Pinnock, has
announced the resolution of another casualty of Telstra (COT)
claimant's case. However, because the COT arbitration cases are
confidential Pinnock did not release further details. (23/12/95)

FROM 281 TO FOUR PAGES, FCC REPORT DIGESTS NEW TELECOM BILL

The differences of House- and Senate-passed telecom legislation
have been reconciled by a House-Senate conference committee into
a compromise bill - a "conference report" - that largely hews to
the House version of the bill, but incorporates Senate language
on such key issues as universal service. The report still only
is being circulated on Capitol Hill and among key lobbyists, but
a copy of the 281-page measure obtained by FCC Report shows it
is full-scale legislation, ready to be passed by each chamber -
if key leaders give their go-ahead.  But while the legislation
looks like the stuff of future law, will anyone but lawyers be
able to read it?  FCC Report offers this condensed version.

TITLE I:  Telecommunication Services

In Part II, "The Development of Competitive Markets," the bill
gets down to the nitty-gritty, detailing the interconnection and
universal service requirements and eliminating federal and state
barriers to local-market entry.  This section includes the
checklist of services that all telcos, except some rural ones,
must make available to competitors.  They must offer
interconnection and unbundled access to network elements "at any
technically feasible point within the carrier's network" and on
"just, reasonable and nondiscriminatory" terms.  They must also
provide nondiscriminatory resale, number portability, dialing
parity, access to their right of way and reciprocal compensation
arrangements.

Regarding resale, the bill requires all services the telco
retails to also be offered at wholesale, but lets state
regulators ban competitors from reselling a telco's local
services to business customers if the regulators choose.  The
telco must also offer the competitor on-site colocation unless
the state regulators allow the telco to provide virtual, or
offsite, colocation.

The FCC is given six months to write these rules.  It also gets
to preempt state rules if those rules violate the bill's local
competition requirements.

The states, meanwhile, are allowed to set their own rules,
provided they do not "substantially prevent implementation" of
this part of the bill.  They also can issue exemptions to small
telcos (those with less than 2 percent of the nation's access
lines) if compliance with a part of the law would be "unduly
economically burdensome" or not technically feasible.  (But
rural cable TV operators offering telephony don't qualify for
this.)

States also get to review interconnection agreements - they can
reject them if they violate the public interest, among other
grounds - and they must act within 90 days or the agreement goes
into effect.  The bill also lets the FCC step in and take charge
of any proceeding if it is advised or otherwise learns that the
state is not carrying out its job under the new law.

States also get to review the terms and conditions offered by
their Bell company - they must act on the tariff in 60 days -
and they get to set the wholesale rates for a telco's telecom
services.  The bill defines "wholesale" as the retail rate,
minus the telco's "avoidable" costs such as billing, marketing,
collection.  (This resolves a long-standing dispute over what
terms should govern resale.)

All negotiations with competitors must be in good faith and the
resulting agreements, with prices, are to be submitted to state
regulators, who also can be called on to mediate negotiations.

If they don't get an agreement 135 days after their request, a
competitors may call on state regulators to impose compulsory
arbitration on the telco.  The state can then set the rates and
implementation schedule for a telco to provide the requested
service.  But, in setting those rates, the state cannot use
rate-of-return regulation and "may include a reasonable profit."
Charges for transport and termination of traffic must allow each
carrier to recover its costs.

The opposite side of the coin, for state regulators, is that
they must remove all barriers to entry to both the interstate
and intrastate telecom markets.  But they still get to impose
their own universal service and public safety requirements and
they and local governments get to manage their rights of way,
provided they don't discriminate among carriers.

On universal service, the bill requires all carriers to
contribute to universal service, but only allows eligible
carriers - common carriers selected by their state - to withdraw
from that fund.  Otherwise, it follows the route taken on that
topic by the House legislation by giving the job of setting the
universal service rules to a federal-state board.  The board and
the FCC, which will implement those rules, will act under a set
of principles, including a mission to ensure that comparable
rates and services are available in urban and rural areas.  The
definition of universal service can be expanded by the FCC, the
bill says.

On the other hand, the bill also requires that discounted
service be offered to  public elementary and secondary schools
and to libraries.  The FCC will set the discount.  Rural health
care providers - medical schools, county health departments -
also cannot be charged more for service than their urban
counterparts.

Unlike resale, sharing allows a telco, typically a smaller one,
to rely on the facilities of the larger telco, say a specialized
switch, to offer services in the small telco's own region. Thus,
the bill says qualifying carriers "lack economies of scale or
scope" but also says telco A cannot require telco B to share
facilities if telco A will use them in telco B's territory; a
different section of the bill governs local competition.

The bill also lets the nation's 14 utility companies that are
regulated by a 1935 federal law provide telecom services, but
requires those companies to first apply to the FCC and to abide
by several rules.  For instance, the parent company may not sell
its facilities to its telecom subsidiary without state approval
and the subsidiary may neither offer its own stock or bonds.
Even the parent company cannot mortgage its operation to finance
its telecom operation.  And the parent must file reports with
the FCC concerning its capitalization of its telecom venture and
states may audit the books of the subsidiary or the parent.

Part III, "Special Provisions Concerning Bell Operating
Companies," gives the particulars on the incentive - entry into
new markets - that the bill offers the Bells in return for
opening their networks.  The bill lets a Bell into out-of-region
long-distance immediately and lets a Bell company immediately
apply to the FCC to offer in-region long-distance.  It also lets
a Bell offer "incidental" long-distance immediately, meaning the
use of long-distance to carry its video or alarm monitoring
traffic or cellular calls.

The FCC, which must act within 90 days, will grant permission on
a state-by-state basis after reviewing the application and
consulting with the Department of Justice (DOJ).  The FCC must
give "substantial weight" to the DOJ's view, but that view need
not preclude the FCC from reaching a differing decision. Once
the FCC gives its OK on long-distance, that Bell is also
automatically allowed to enter the once-proscribed business of
manufacturing network and customer premises equipment.

If the Bell violates the terms of its approval to enter long-
distance, the FCC can also revoke its approval or impose fines.

To win FCC approval, the Bell company must meet the bill's
special checklist of open access conditions and have in each
state a local competitor that is predominately facilities-based.
The list requires interconnection be made available and that the
Bell offer nondiscriminatory access to poles, ducts and right-
of-way elements.  It also must offer these items on an unbundled
basis:

*  local loop transmission from central offices to customer
premises,

*  local transport from the trunk side of the switch and

*  local switching.

The Bell must be willing to resell its services, provide
reciprocal compensation and offer competitors access to "911"
and "E911" services, directory assistance, operator call
completion service, White pages listings of its competitor's
customers, interim number portability (via call forwarding), and
full number portability (when the FCC issues the rules ).

If the Bell has submitted its terms and conditions to a state
and gotten no takers after 10 months, or gotten a taker who
negotiated in bad faith, a Bell can "self certify" compliance
for that state.

A Bell also is required to offer dialing parity, but not for
three years, unless it enters long-distance or is in a state
that is all of one LATA or has required that service as of Dec.
19, 1995.

Hewing to the Senate bill's language, a Bell in long-distance or
manufacturing must house those businesses in separate
subsidiaries involving separate books and offices and a federal-
state audit every two years.  But, taking the language of the
House bill, the bill lets a Bell eliminate these separate
subsidiaries three years after it it wins entry into the long-
distance business.

On manufacturing, the bill requires each Bell company to
maintain a separate manufacturing subsidiary that does not
discriminate in favor of its parent.  Nor can the parent
discriminate in favor of that affiliate in terms of certifying
equipment for network use or by giving it information on its
competitors that the competitors haven't allowed.

When buying equipment, a Bell cannot discriminate in favor of
its manufacturing unit and must consider other makers' hardware
as well.

The Bell also must file with the FCC full information on the
protocols and technical requirements of its network and to keep
that information up to date.  The Bell also must keep
interconnected competitors posted on changes the Bell plans to
its network.  As for Bellcore, the Bell's research operation, it
continues to be banned from manufacturing until it is no longer
affiliated with more than one Bell company.

On electronic publishing by the Bells, the bill again requires a
separate subsidiary, one that can hold no property in common
with its parent nor use the parent's name or trademark.  The
Bell cannot engage in joint activities with this affiliate other
than to jointly do telemarketing or operate a "teaming
arrangement."  Such an arrangement, says the bill, could involve
the Bell providing its facilities or basic phone service to the
affiliate.

But this separate subsidiary is no longer required four years
after the parent Bell is allowed into long-distance.

On alarm monitoring, the bill bans the Bell companies from
entering that line of business for five year after enactment,
except for Ameritech, which already owns an alarm monitoring
company.  However, Ameritech cannot acquire other alarm
monitoring companies for five years.

TITLE II: Broadcast Services deals with changes that aim to
speed the renewal of broadcast licenses and to give broadcasters
more flexibility.  Presently, the bill tells the FCC to give new
digital "advanced television (ATV)" spectrum only to
broadcasters and not to auction it.  (If the broadcaster uses
ATV for for-pay services, the FCC gets the right to assess fees
on that service.)

This is the section of the bill most in flux.  Senate Majority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., would rather have the FCC auction that
spectrum to raise revenue to reduce the federal debt.  An
agreement on this could help solve the continuing dispute over
the federal budget.

This section of the bill also loosens current limits on how many
radio and TV stations may be owned per market.  TV station
owners, though, are still subject to the one station per market
rule, but now can seek FCC waivers of the rule in any of the top
50 markets.

Broadcasters also now are able to buy cable TV networks and
their licenses will run for eight years, not 10.  However,
renewal has been speeded since the FCC cannot ask for any
information that already has been supplied to it earlier by the
applicant, nor can it consider competing applicants' claims to
provide better uses of the licensee's license.

In fact, the FCC can only turn down a renewal application if
there was a pattern of violations of the law, a serious
violation or a failure to serve the public interest.

TITLE IV: Cable Services aims to give cable TV the flexibility
and the profitability to compete with local telcos.  It does so
by lifting cable TV rate regulation "upper tier" services in
markets where there is "effective competition."  For instance,
if a local telco offers video programming on its network.

Small operators, those with less than 1 percent of all U.S.
subscribers, are rate-deregulated immediately. And all cable
operators escape rate regulation of service packages, other than
the locally-regulated basic tier, as of March 1999.

Presently, complaints about cable TV rates can be filed by any
person with the FCC, which then launches an examination of
whether the rate meets the national "benchmark" of fairness.  If
not, the rate must fall.

Under the bill, the FCC will regulate rates until competition or
the "sunset date" arrives, but rate complaints will only be
allowed from the cable operator's local franchise authority.
And the franchiser can't complain unless it receives citizen
complaints within 90 days of the rate increase. Turning to
telco-provided video, the bill retains current Title III
regulation for wireless cable systems, Title II rules for pure
common carrier systems and Title VI rules for telco-owned cable
TV systems.  But the bill also creates a new category called
"open video systems" that are like a common carrier network, but
on which the carrier can own some of the programming. Those
systems may program up to two-thirds of their systems with their
own content, but have to leave the remaining third open to other
content providers - if "demand exceeds channel capacity..."

The FCC must write the rules for such system within six months
and then will sit in judgment on the applications of telcos that
want this form of streamlined regulation.  The category  exempts
operators from franchise fees, although the bill states that a
fee may be paid by the operator in lieu of the franchise fee.

Telcos, under the bill can own no more than 10 percent of the
cable system in their territory unless the cable system serves a
rural area of under 35,000 population or the telco has under
$100 million revenues and the cable system has under 20,000
subscribers (and no more than 12,000 are in an urban area).  Two
other conditions that allow such mergers are if the cable system
serves fewer than 10 percent of the households in the telco's
service area or the FCC issues a waiver.

Title V: Broadcast Obscenity and Violence is perhaps the most
controversial part of the bill, the part best known to the
general public and also the part most likely to face immediate
court challenge.  In general, it calls for TV set makers to
begin including a "V chip" in their sets so that parents can
program the sets to block shows that carry high violence content
ratings.

DEMOCRATS, BELLS SCORE ON TELECOM BILL - IF THIS VERSION FLIES

Casey Stengel would be proud.  Turns out Stengel's axiom "it
ain't over till it's over" applies as aptly to telecom reform
legislation as it does to baseball games.

Late last month, Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., chairman of the
House-Senate conference committee on the bill, thought he and
key committee members had struck a compromise that gave
concessions to the Clinton administration in order to avert a
threatened veto.  But when conservative Republicans heard about
the terms, they rebelled, forcing Pressler to call his deal just
a "framework agreement" and scuttling plans to bring the bill to
a pre-Christmas vote.

The new uncertainty left the bill vulnerable to more changes.
The latest draft of the bill is not public but a copy obtained
by FCC Report shows changes already have been made to Pressler's
framework deal.  One of them is the removal of language that
would have kept the Bell companies from joint-marketing long-
distance and local service until a year after their local
competitors were doing so.

There's still some uncertainty whether this version will do the
trick.  Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole says he has some
disagreements with the bill.  He and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., will meet this week.

Gingrich called "time out" last month, advising House
Republicans to hold off on

voting on the report until after Congress returns to session
this week.  His staff said the speaker had not yet reviewed the
new language to see if it was sufficiently deregulatory.

On the other hand, Pressler and Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va.,
support the bill.

Perhaps recognizing that only the fine details of the bill
remain to be ironed-out, all sides in the yearlong battle appear
to be pulling back their forces.  Jim Smith, president of the
Competitive Telecommunications Association (CompTel), told FCC
Report his group of local competitors doubts it will get the
conference committee to reverse itself and toughen a condition
on Bell long-distance entry.

At the United States Telephone Association (USTA), chief
lobbyist Larry Clinton, said his group has given up hope of
getting the conference to undo a change to the bill that lets
states use rate-of-return regulation for competitive services.
The provision was excised early last month by the conference
committee, which is producing a compromise version of the
telecom bills passed this summer by the House and Senate.

Another measure of how the deal is jelling:  Key factions are
releasing statements endorsing the new draft bill, even though
it has not been released.  Supporters include the
Telecommunications Industry Association, the Alliance for
Competitive Communications - the Bell's lobbying group - and the
National Association of Broadcasters.

The USTA and CompTel haven't issued statements, but Clinton said
he expects the USTA "will be OK" on the bill and Smith said his
group will find the bill "minimally acceptable" as long as it's
not changed more.

A similar view was expressed by a long-distance industry source,
who warned that the game is not over.  If the bill remains
unchanged, he said, long-distance will grudgingly support it.
However, he noted that, "The ball has already been pulled out
from under us once" this year when a "manager's amendment" in
the House undid the pro-long-distance language of that chamber's
bill just before passage.

The heavy-hitters are checking their swings because they've
chalked up plenty of runs in the last inning of the bill's ball
game.  In recent days, the Bells have won the right to keep one
of their brethren, Ameritech, from expanding its alarm-
monitoring operations beyond the company's current holdings.

Ameritech, the only Bell the bill lets into alarm monitoring -
by "grandfathering" the company's current holdings - now cannot
expand its alarm monitoring presence until after the five-year
wait that the bill imposes on all of the Bells seeking to get
into that line of business.

Ameritech's next alarm monitoring move was expected to be
outside of its territory.

The nation's 14 largest utility companies also scored by
convincing the conferees to let them offer telecom services.
But the latest draft of the conference report - in effect, the
new telecom bill - shows that the biggest runs were scored by
the Democrats, including the addition of a role for the
Department of Justice (DOJ) in assessing the long-distance entry
applications of the Bell companies.

Though the role is only advisory, as the Senate bill originally
offered, the change was one of three called for by the White
House when the administration was threatening a veto.

Another recent change is adoption of the House bill's 35 percent
cap on the size of the national audience that any one TV station
chain may accumulate.  The cap, a part of the House telecom bill
added by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., addresses the "media
concentration" aspect of the bill, another prime White House
worry.

Those and other changes were added to the bill after a meeting
Dec. 13 between Pressler and Bliley and the two top Democrats on
the conference committee, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan and Sen.
Ernest Hollings of South Carolina.

For his part, sources say Hollings was able to convince Pressler
to remove from the bill entirely all language that would have
lifted the current 25 percent cap on foreign investment in FCC
licensees.

The next day, Pressler and Bliley were set to sell their deal to
House and Senate Republicans.  But that morning's newspapers
reported that Vice President Al Gore had endorsed the bill on
behalf of the Clinton administration, the entity most
conservative Republicans despise.

The error cost Pressler his run.  He was forced to call his deal
a "framework" - not an agreement - when key conferees, including
Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, the chairman of the House telecom
subcommittee and a key drafter of the House bill, rebelled.
Fields released a statement saying, "There was no deal" with the
White House, and then left to spend the holidays with his family
in Texas.

The Senate returned to session yesterday and House returns
today, but it's still uncertain when Congress will to take up
the telecom bill.  The chief item on the agenda remains federal
budget legislation and, if no new compromise is available for a
vote, some members may call for another recess so that they can
tend to their re-election campaigns.

Therefore, the best that can be expected is for the conference
report to be voted on by the conferees and released this week.
More likely, the report will be held back.

Besides the new role for the DOJ in deciding Bell entry into
long-distance, other key aspects of the draft version of the
report are:

*     "Grandfathering" states that, as of Dec. 1995, require the
Bells to offer dialing parity,

*     Expedited judicial review of the bill's "cyberporn"
restrictions, and

*     Inclusion of the Senate bill's requirement that discounted
telecom service be offered to schools and libraries.  Now,
however, the requirement is part of the definition of universal
service itself, meaning that providers can seek compensation for
their loss via the universal service subsidy.

The DOJ's role on Bell long-distance entry will come as part of
the FCC's imposition of a public-interest test on Bell long-
distance applications, a concept taken from the Senate telecom
bill.  The FCC must give "substantial weight" to the DOJ's
assessment, but that assessment will not be decisive in itself,
the new version of the bill states.

The Pressler compromise also requires a Bell to first have a
facilities-based competitor in place, as the House wanted,

and give the FCC the power to test whether there is "actual and
demonstrable" local competition in the Bell's local market.  But
the Pressler framework agreement eliminates language adopted by
the conferees just days before that would have required Bell
long-distance entry to be predicated on the Bell facing
competition throughout each of its states, not just in one city
in each state.

The bill does not require the Bells to provide dialing parity
until they enter the long-distance business, unless they operate
in a state that has only one LATA or which required the service
as of December 1995.  Dialing parity, already available in long-
distance, means the ability to place a local call on a competing
carrier's network by dialing the same number of digits as needed
by the local carrier's network.

The bill bans making indecent material available over electronic
networks, a hewing to the Senate bill's approach.  The bill's
penalties for sending "cyberporn" - a fine up to $100,000 and up
to 10 years in jail - are also the same as the Senate bill's,
but the draft bill uses the test of whether such material is
indecent, not the "harmful to minors" standard that has been
upheld by federal courts.

As a concession to opponents, the bill calls for expedited
judicial review of this provision, meaning that legal challenges
to the law will, if appealed, go directly from the federal
district court to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Contrary to the House version of the telecom bill, the draft
agreement has no language banning the FCC from regulating the
Internet or letting the FCC selectively lift the 25 percent cap
on foreign ownership of FCC licensees.  But these changes may be
subject to change.  The Senate appears willing to accept
Pressler's view that the latter matter should be dealt with via
separate legislation - he says a bill will be introduced this
spring - but some in the House still are pressing their fight to
return their foreign ownership language to the bill.

In the Senate, Pressler believes he has "a good majority" but
his compromise has won an ardent foe, fellow conferee Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.  A source with McCain's office told FCC Report,
"My boss and others were beside themselves" when they heard
about the framework agreement.  The deal, he said, was worked
out behind closed doors, with Hollings, the ranking Democratic
senator on the conference committee, carrying water for the
White House.

McCain voted against the Senate bill when it came to the floor
and now his staff hints he will use his considerable power as a
senator to slow the conference report's progress in the Senate
until he wins his revisions.

FCC STILL CLOSED, BUT LICENSE AUCTIONS ROLL ON - NETTING $1.5B

The FCC's offices have been closed since Dec. 22, but that
hasn't kept the money from rolling in.  Since that date, the FCC
has netted nearly $1.5 billion for the U.S. Treasury from three
auctions of operating licenses.

The auctions were suspended for the holidays and resume this
week -which is more than can be said for the operations of the
commission itself.  Only a skeleton crew, most of them involved
with the auctions, is working at FCC headquarters.  The nearly
2,000 other FCC employees have been furloughed and won't return
until funding for the commission and other government agencies
is restored.

The shutdown of the FCC so far has had only limited impact on
telecom regulation - most of the action right now is on Capitol
Hill - but it has postponed release of the FCC's report and
order on the investment of Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom
in Sprint.  A Sprint source said the company cannot be sure of
how to proceed regarding the $4 billion investment until the FCC
releases its full report on the matter, which was decided at the
FCC's Dec. 15 meeting.

Also delayed will be the planned Jan. 18 meeting and any action
on proposed rulemakings, such as that regarding GTE's recent
request to deaverage its switched access rates and offer volume
discounts in five states.  Comments on the plan, which resembles
the Nynex Universal Service Preservation Plan the commission
adopted in 1995, were due yesterday, but the FCC is not
accepting filings during the shutdown.  Instead, all comments
due during the shutdown are due the day the FCC re-opens.

This means the FCC also may have to postpone its planned day-
long enbanc hearing on spectrum policy.  More likely, it will
hold that hearing, scheduled for Jan. 31, in lieu of its January
meeting.  However requests to participate in the hearing were
due Dec. 22.

While some actions have been delayed, the three license auctions
the FCC began in December were not.  Of these, the auction of 30
megahertz (MHz) personal communications service (PCS) licenses
has generated the most revenue.  The auction, which began Dec.
15 and is open only to small businesses, posted $1.2 billion of
the $1.45 billion earned so far in all three December auctions -
after just four rounds of bidding.

The top bidders in the PCS auction, which resumes Jan. 5, are
PCS 2000 LP, which bid $443 million and is high bidder in 124
markets; GWI PCS Inc., which bid $257 million and is high bidder
in 10 markets; and NextWave Personal Communications, which bid
$162 million and is high bidder in six markets.

The PCS auction involves the nation's 493 metropolitan trading
areas (MTA), as defined by the Rand McNally Business Atlas.  Of
these, PCS 2000 holds the top bid ($203 million) for any MTA,
that of New York City.  Next in the ranking are GWI PCS, which
bid $113 million for Los Angeles, and DCR PCS Inc., which bid
$70 million for Chicago.

The second auction, which resumes Jan. 4, involves specialized
mobile radio  (SMR) licenses and has netted $167 million in
revenue, a figure that  includes the fines assessed against
those that withdrew bids.  Without those fines, which surely
will be disputed, the figure is $100 million less.

In the SMR auction, Paging Network of America, Ram Mobile Data
and Geotek Communications are among the most prevalent bidders
for the regional licenses at stake.  Paging Network holds the
highest bid so far, the $925 million it offered for the New York
license, which also includes much of Northern New Jersey.

The third auction, which resumes today, involves a form of
wireless cable TV service called multipoint distribution service
(MDS).  The auction has generated $73 million after 37 rounds of
bidding.

Among the leading bidders is CAI Wireless Systems, a wireless
cable company jointly owned by Nynex and Bell Atlantic.  CAI
Wireless has the top bids in New York and Washington, D.C.,
which so far have generated the highest bids.  In those markets,
it has offered $3.1 million and $2 million respectively.

SMALL CARRIERS NET BIG COMPLAINT TOTALS, FCC STUDY FINDS

Some of the nation's smallest carriers have garnered the highest
number of customer complaints, according to recent FCC data.
The data, contained in a "Common Carrier Scorecard," shows three
companies - Oncor Communications, Value Added Communications and
Zero Plus Dialing Inc. (ZPDI) - far exceeding the nation's
multibillion-dollar carriers, when all carriers are compared on
the basis of their annual revenue.

For instance, ZDPI garnered 9 complaints per million dollars in
revenue, while Bell Atlantic netted .03 complaints per million
dollars in revenue.

Other small companies leading the list of complaint recipients
include Operator Assistance Network (275), Sonic Communications
(130) and Matrix Telecom (114).  Matrix last month was fined
$40,000 for slamming, the unauthorized transfer of customers
from one long-distance carrier to another.

Slamming was one of the top three reasons for the customer
complaints, which routinely pour into the FCC.  The other
reasons were operator services and "800-" number information
services.

Oncor, an operator services provider (OSP), was a leader in this
type of complaint.  Other top complaint-receiving OSPs:  Polar
Communications and Cleartel.

But the FCC said a key finding of the study, which used 1994's
complaint totals, was how few companies were netting complaints,
when companies were equalized for size.  Of the total 11,350
complaints, only 67 companies received more than 10.

In fact, 20 companies were responsible for 73 percent of all
complaints, the FCC said.

Compared on a per-line basis, small companies lead the list of
complaint recipients, even though their total complaints were
sometimes smaller than those filed against major carriers.  For
instance, Oncor's 590 complaints equaled 1,140 per million lines
while Bell Atlantic's 385 complaints equaled 21 per million
lines.

The report found that some carriers have complaint rates 100
times greater than the rates held by large carriers, the FCC
charged.

The FCC also ranked the nation's largest local carriers on the
basis of their complaints (see chart), but noted that complaints
made about those carriers often involve services the customer
reached via that carrier and not the local carrier itself.

The commission said carriers can reduce their complaint levels
by improving customer service, maintaining better billing and
service records and resolving complaints quickly.

'TOWER' OF 214S SHRINKS AS CARRIERS GIVE UP, LOOK TO CONGRESS

The towering pile of Section 214 applications that once loomed
over the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau is fast becoming a mole-
hill, partly because of industry reluctance to continue pursuing
the applications - which will be done away with under the
congressional telecom bill.

Last month, Ameritech became the latest Bell company to pull out
of the Section 214 process, which a phone company now must
follow in order to build a video dialtone (VDT) network.  It
acted just weeks before its applications were to expire under
the FCC rule that a permit holder must act on its application
within 12 months.

In December 1994, the FCC approved Ameritech's five applications
to construct VDT networks that would serve 1.2 million homes in
its service region.  But the telco has since shifted strategy
toward becoming a franchise cable operator.

"There were two main reasons for the withdrawal," Ameritech
spokesman Dave Onak said.  "We have been getting increasing
community support for us to operate as a cable franchise
operator.  And the FCC still has not finalized their VDT rules."

Ironically, the chief reason the commission has failed to act is
that it first must see what rules Congress sets for VDT in the
telecom legislation.

Ameritech currently has eight franchise agreements with the
local authorities, primarily in the outlying areas of Detroit.

Onak said Ameritech continues with its brisk construction pace
despite the fact that the FCC has yet to approve the
applications.  Additionally, Illinois cable operators are suing
the telco and the authorities in Glendale Heights.

Nevertheless, Ameritech intends to begin offering programming
service during the first half of 1996, Onak said.  "We've got a
court ruling that said we can do so, so why not?"

Ameritech is in engaged in franchise discussions with an
additional 40 communities across the Midwest, Onak said.  The
telco has no plans to attempt to provide cable service outside
of its five-state region.  "We've got enough to keep us busy in
our own backyard," he said.

During the past year a handful of telcos - including Bell
Atlantic and U S West -  have amended, and then outright pulled
their applications for commercial VDT before they ever got to
the approval stage at the commission.  Of concern is the rapidly
changing technological landscape and the commission's lack of
clarity on just how, when and where the telcos can operate VDT
service.

Bell Atlantic in the late spring withdrew two of its Section
214s and currently has only one 214 application pending, which
seeks to provide VDT service over a switched digital video
network in Florham, N.J.  The application was filed nearly three
years ago and spokesman Harry Mitchell said the telco is letting
it sit because it includes up-to-date technology.  Bell Atlantic
has no plans to file any other Section 214s in the near future.

"The wild card is the federal legislation," Mitchell said.  "We
are prepared to make the filings if necessary but we are not
going to tip our hand if we don't have to."

The FCC said it will finalize its VDT regulations by early 1996
if the federal government does not pass telecom reform
legislation making it a moot point.

THE POST-BILL WORLD: MORE LAWSUITS, NEED FOR WELL-CRAFTED RULES

Now that the congressional telecom bill appears on track to
enactment, several industry experts say the bill will promote
litigation and that regulators have their work cut out for them.

That's because Congress can give a general statement of what it
wants but the rules must be detailed to get that view to work.
Augie Ros, adviser to the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC)
chairman, noted how, recalled how, as part of its adoption of
the Ameritech Customers First plan, the ICC set a formula for
the cost of a loop.  Thus, Ameritech's tariff for loop costs
included at least one no-cost loop.   Yet, said Ros, the move
was completely within the new rules.

There's aspects of new rules "you can't even begin to think
about," he warned.

Attorney Jon Canis, of the Washington firm of Swidler & Berlin,
agreed and pointed to the FCC's efforts to produce rules on
colocation, virtual or physical.  He advised the FCC to turn to
states like Illinois for advice on how to proceed with some of
the ground-breaking rules the bill will require.

"Whether this [legislation] will work will depend on whether
[the FCC] will cooperate" with the states, said Joseph DiBella,
a federal regulatory attorney in Nynex's governmental affairs
unit.

Ros, Canis and DiBella all spoke at a December conference
sponsored by the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche and
Business Research Publications.

There, DiBella and Canis warned that another outgrowth of the
bill's passage will be litigation.  Calling the new law "a boon
to regulatory lawyers," DiBella said the FCC and state boards
can avoid litigation by setting up step-by-step routes to
compliance - and offering carriers incentives along the way.

That's the idea behind giving the Bells a shot at the long-
distance market once they meet the bill's checklist of open
access and unbundling requirements.

Canis said the bill's passage is essential - because of lawyers,
who otherwise drive up the cost of any company trying to enter
local competition on a state-by-state basis.  It can cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars to mount these cases before
each state board, he said, because of the lawyers and expert
witnesses involved.

CABLEVISION SYSTEMS ANNOUNCES $300 MILLION FIBER BUILD

     Cablevision Systems Corp. has announced it will invest $300
million in northeastern Ohio to build a fiber optic telecommunications
system.  The company already has begun constructing the 750 MHz
system, which Cablevision says will provide a platform for programming
choices and advanced two-way communications services.
     "The new telecommunications network will initially provide 77
analog channels with future digital capacity," says Lawrence Drake,
senior vice president and general manager for Cablevision's midwest
region.  
     "In the near future, those programming choices will be joined by
the exciting new capabilities that our fiber optic telecommunications
system allows, including video-on-demand, interactive services and
high-speed computer connections," Drake says.
     Cablevision anticipates the $300 million investment will create
an estimated 100 new jobs.  Cablevision of Ohio now employs 670.  
     The company recently applied with the Public Utilities Commission
of Ohio to provide telephone service there as part of its attempts to
broaden its market impact.  (James Evangelista, 216/696-0229.)

DSC-BELL ATLANTIC FIBER EQUIPMENT DEAL SEEN WORTH $150 MILLION

     DSC Communications Corp. has signed a two-year agreement with
Bell Atlantic Corp. to supply DSC's Next Generation Digital Loop
Carrier equipment. An industry source says the deal is worth
approximately $150 million during that period.  The deal primarily
involves DSC's Litespan-2000 product, this source told us.
     The agreement is part of an ongoing relationship that DSC has had
with the regional holding company, which continues to be a major
customer as it packs more fiber into its network. For example, Bell
Atlantic contracts with DSC accounted for 10 percent of DSC's annual
revenues in 1992 and 11 percent in 1993.
     Bell Atlantic actually has been deploying the Litespan product
since 1990, according to DSC.  DSC characterizes Litespan as the fiber
optics industry's first integrated, synchronous optical network-based,
optical loop carrier system.

AMP'S GLENN MOORE NAMED SPECTRAN'S PRESIDENT, CEO

     Recently reorganized SpecTran Corp. has named Glenn Moore to be its
president and CEO.  Raymond Jaeger remains chairman of the board of the
Sturbridge, Mass.-based company.
     Moore, 44, comes from outside the company.  He was general manager
of the Optical Connectors and Assemblies Division at Amp, where he spent
20 years.
     "The experience and success Glenn Moore achieved in developing
Amp's Optical Connector business will be a major asset in the execution
of SpecTran's aggressive growth plan," commented Jaeger.  "[The move]
will allow me to concentrate more on longer term corporate development
issues and pursue strategic alliance opportunities that will further
strengthen and diversify the company."
     Reporting to Moore will be the heads of SpecTran's three subsidiary
companies, which were created as part of the reorganization.  These
subsidiaries include SpecTran Communication Fiber Technologies Inc.;
SpecTran Specialty Optics Co.; and Applied Photonic Devices.
     Bruce Cannon, SpecTran's chief financial officer, also will report
to Moore.

ANDREW TO MARKET HYBRID FIBER/COAX CABLE

     As part of its positioning in both the cellular and fiber worlds,
Andrew Corp. is introducing premise composite fiber optic and copper
cable assemblies for use in cellular and emerging personal
communications systems.
     The assemblies connect RF antennas that provide coverage throughout
a building with cellular or PCS base stations via an RF analog fiber
optic link which includes the electrical conductors that power the
remotely located antennas.  These composite cables may also be
integrated with an uninterruptible power supply so that a building power
outage will not affect wireless services.
     The cable assembly is composed of two Andrew-manufactured
Microcables, including optical connectors and two standard insulated
copper wires.  Single-mode fiber--which can be dispersion-shifted--is
incorporated.  The company notes that such cables eliminate the need for
"bulky ductwork" because the company's optical fiber cables employ a
unique sheathing design that protects the cable.     The composite design
allows electrical power and fiber to run together, making expensive
conduit, outlets or transformers unnecessary, Andrew says.

1996: MAJOR GROWTH SPURRED BY DEREGULATION, HYBRIDIZATION, THE INTERNET

     The year 1996 will be a strong one for fiber optics both in the
United States and throughout the world, according to extensive
interviews we have conducted with fiber optics industry experts.
     Global telecom deregulation, and particularly the potential for
opening markets in the United States, will continue to accelerate the
growth of fiber optics.  Because of its amazing properties, fiber
continues to find its way into operating networks, whether it is pushing
closer to the home as the result of cable TV overbuilds in hybrid fiber
coax networks, via a new product that Andrew Corp. is announcing that
packs both fiber and copper into the same cable, or as part of the new
hybrid fiber wireless architecture.
     When we asked James Crowe, chairman and CEO of MFS Communications
Co. Inc., what general business trends in fiber he anticipates will
occur in the coming year, he responded, "The Internet, the Internet and
the Internet."  It is cheaper by over a factor of 100 to move
information over the Internet versus the circuit switched voice network,
said Crowe.  That kind of economic advantage is unstoppable over the
longer term.
     The paradigm shift in many companies to the Internet suggests an
opportunity to many of our interviewees for fiber.  Forget the video-on-
demand market dream that simply has not driven bandwidth to this level,
we were told; right under our noses people are demanding more bandwidth
on the Internet--and there is no doubt that fiber optics will deliver
it.

  ...All Agree: A Solid U.S. Market, Especially With Telecom Reform

     1996 very well may be the most explosive year that we have seen in
the industry, says Craig Young, president of Brooks Fiber.  "We will see
a lot of folks that are new players in new markets that will be building
infrastructure in new fiber markets," Young tells us.  "You are probably
going to see an explosion of fiber going into the ground."
     The only limitations to U.S. fiber growth are going to be the fiber
manufacturing capabilities of Corning and Alcatel, says Gary Glick,
business unit manager of fiber optic cable at  Andrew Corp..
     Crowe believes 1996 will be "an excellent year," noting that the
focus may shift a little from more traditional voice-oriented telco
services to methods of broadband interconnect with the Internet.  "If
the local loop was considered a bottleneck for voice-grade service, it
becomes a real restriction as people demand more broadband access to the
Internet," says Crowe.
     Brian McFadden, assistant vice president of high capacity
applications for the SONET networks group at Nortel, believes "the
demand for bandwidth across the network is increasing and therefore
fiber deployment should be strong in 1996."  McFadden believes it still
is "an elastic market for bandwidth" as prices come down and new
applications are invented. 
     "In the area of high-speed, trunked telecommunications, 1996 is
going to be the year that 10 Gbps OC-192 networks come into play and at
the same time the first [large commercial] deployments of
multiwavelength WDM times OC-48," says John Ryan, principal at the
California consulting firm of Ryan, Hankin and Kent. "The next step in
high capacity telecom gear is going to happen in 1996 and that will push
the state of development of both TDM and dense WDM."  With regard to
high speed TDM and WDM, "its very clear that at least for the first
several years, they have to co-exist," says Ryan. 
     Stephen Montgomery, vice president of Electronicast Corp., a
competitor to Ryan, Hankin also based in California, believes strong
markets will continue for premises data and broadband communications. 
"We see prices remaining very stable, although going up in [a few] fiber
optic cable components."
     The market for fiber to support cable TV also is expected to
continue strong in the coming year.  "We feel it will be a very good
year," says Ron Coppock, vice president of international sales and
marketing for Texscan. How good, Coppock adds, depends on whether
telecom reform legislation is passed into law.  Still, "in terms of HFC
architecture we build products for, we see an increased evolution toward
that type of architecture and the market is significant."  There are a
number of 350 MHz or 550 MHz architectures that need to be rebuilt and
Coppock does not see that happening without some fiber infrastructure
going in as part of it.
     Andy Meyer, Scientific-Atlanta Inc.'s director of marketing for
transmissions, believes there "will be a lot more activity on the MSO
side continuing in fiber for 1996."  Meyer believes a lot of that is
driven by the concept of narrowcasting, which he defines as the ability
of cable companies to segment their markets into smaller sections. 
"They have done infrastructure changes that allow them to go to smaller
pockets of nodes and they can target those nodes with a specific
advertising using data modems," continues Meyer.  "Fiber optics to allow
them to do that."
     Scientific-Atlanta also is pretty optimistic about the products it
makes for the telecom market, says Tim Wilk, director of strategic
planning. The regional holding companies (RHCs) have been trying
unsuccessfully to get into the video market for a number of years, he
observes.  "As we start 1996, there are a number of RHCs that are ready
to start rolling out HFC networks. With Pacific Bell and SNET we see the
integrated networks," he continues.  "We are really excited about some
of the telcos that are starting to build a video-only system."  It is a
trend that Wilk believes will "really kick into high gear" in 1996 as
the telcos see that fiber to the curb is not living up to its
capabilities and not hitting the target availability and cost targets.
     "Emerging technologies can only run on fiber," says one
interviewee, who works for an RHC and who asked not to be identified. 
"That is where the growth is going to come," this source adds.  "You are
going to see major market growth in the United States."
     Drew Zogby, director of strategic marketing for ADC
Telecommunications Broadband Connectivity Division, believes 1996 will
be a very strong year for U.S. fiber optics deployment. 
     Otto Szentisi, vice president and director of hardware and
equipment technology at Siecor Corp., says the company expects to see
continued growth, "very similar to 1995."
      Optelecom Chairman William Culver predicts "market revenues will
continue their inevitable growth in spite of decreasing prices."
     David Maack, vice president for research, development and
engineering at Porta Systems, believes telecom reform legislation will
be made law and "it is going to spur people to add plant equipment."
     Michael Mattei, vice president of technology for TII-Ditel, says
there is the potential for large increase in the number of fiber miles
installed in 1996, depending on whether telecom reform legislation is
approved.  If not, the industry will go through its normal increase, he
reasons. 
     Joe Chisholm, a manager of network infrastructure planning and
technology at BellSouth, says that all he has heard "internally and
externally leads me to believe that [the fiber optics market] should
continue to grow." BellSouth's Greg Mims, who has the same title,
believes there will be a continuing upward fiber optics trend across all
of the regions in the U.S.

  ...Diverging Views Mark Undersea Fiber Forecast

     There were widely divergent viewpoints among experts with regard to
undersea growth in fiber.
     "1996 is going to be the busiest year in the history of the world
with regard to the installation of undersea fiber optic cable," says
Clifton Lundberg, president and CEO of General Offshore Corp. (GOC),
which installs optical fiber cable up to depths of 50 meters throughout
the world.  The company recently has been deploying new tools, such as
the Gator, to help get the cable in the mud and out of the way of
anchors and trawling nets.
     GOC's Lundberg cites FLAG, as well as installations in such diverse
places as Ukraine and Thailand as helping to fuel an accelerating
market.  Based in Alexandria, Va., but with offices throughout the
world, GOC is 60 percent owned by Hannon, Armstrong and Co. and 40
percent owned by Cable & Wireless.
     While believing that the terrestrial market in the United States
will remain strong, Konnie Schaefer, president of K. Schaefer &
Associates, believes the market for undersea fiber optic systems "is
going to be slow." That is because, Schaefer reasons, a number of
systems are going to become operational and fulfill demand for 1996.
     "I think there is going to be a significant slowdown from the
standpoint of undersea fiber optic sales," Schaefer says.  One case in
point: Schaefer believes the sweeping SEA-WE-ME-3 network will not go
forward.  He attributes this to changes in the organizational structure
of France Telecom, the governing partner, which have led to questions
raised by the new management as to whether the resulting capacity will
be there to justify the very substantial capital investment.  Officials
from France Telecom would not comment when asked what the current status
of the project is.
     Ando Corp.'s Michael Griffin believes 1996 will be "a strong year"
for fiber optic test instrumentation equipment.

  ...Worldwide Growth Strong: But Know Thine Area

     The global fiber market is "going to be a very positive one in
1996," says Ryan.  "Many nations are building out fiber-rich
infrastructures for telephony and cable TV and in a lot of cases a
combination of the two," he observes. 
     "The southern edge of South America--including Argentina, Chile and
Peru--have become perhaps the most deregulated telecommunications
markets on earth with a resulting upsurge of infrastructure buildout,"
says Ryan.  "I would expect to see a lot more of that occurring in
various different regions."
     In order to take advantage of that, most of the major vendors have
"beefed up their ability" to provide for this market, says Ryan.  "There
are terrific global opportunities," he adds.
     "Most nations outside of a small club of advanced nations have
relatively little telecommunications infrastructure," says Ryan.  The
gap between developing nations and wealthier nations will increase
substantially if these poorer nations do not put in new infrastructure. 
And that translates into more fiber in the ground, Ryan believes.
     Texscan's Coppock sees continuing strong markets in Europe and
Latin America.  While the market for cable TV in the United Kingdom is
consolidating, Coppock sees "a continuing build there that's all
upside."  That's because, they have just turned on their 1 millionth
subscriber in a nation of 48 million people.  "Clearly, there is a lot
of cable passing to be done." 
     Italy is going to be a huge market for cable TV if the nation
approves Socrates, Telecom Italia's vast cable TV project, Coppock says. 
Spain and Portugal also represent opportunities for cable TV
infrastructure incorporating fiber.
     With regard to Latin America, Coppock notes that "there has been a
consolidation in Chile.  Last year there were maybe 10 players, next
year there will be two or three."  He identifies Argentina as a
continuing strong market. 
     Zogby believes that "international growth will continue to be
robust."  He identifies Germany, Chile and Australia as nations that
will continue to  aggressively install fiber.  China, India and other
Asian nations are accelerating fiber optic deployments.  Zogby
identifies Japan as a strong market and believes that Argentina and
Mexico also will grow substantially.  Middle East fiber optics activity
also is up.
     "We see much higher growth, particularly in Asia," says Montgomery. 
For some components, Electronicast predicts growth of 100 percent per
year or higher; in others, it predicts growth of 30 percent.
     International growth is being spurred to some extent by AT&T and
MCI hoping to assume a global presence, says Mattei.  One example is MCI
in Mexico. He believes the amount of fiber going in during 1996 will
represent a larger increase than it did in 1995. 
     "The country that is the most advanced in the use of fiber is
France," says the RHC source requesting anonymity.  "France has us
beaten hands down in the use of fiber.  They are the most advanced in
terms of nuclear power at around 85 percent; they are the most advanced
in terms of fiber at around 65 percent." The nation is very active in
using fiber to deploy smart cars and smart highways.
     Andrew Corp. is involved in joint ventures in Russia, says Glick. 
"We see opportunities in Russia," he notes, particularly as the
situation stabilizes there.  "There is also major activity in China and
India, particularly Shanghai and the coastal areas," Glick believes.
     "In Europe, things are happening a little more rapidly on the
regulatory front than perhaps people had thought," says Crowe of MFS
Communications.  There may be as many as five consortia in Germany who
could put fiber in the ground, he adds.  With regard to deregulation of
Europe's PTTs on Jan. 1, 1997, Crowe believes that "we may see something
similar to what we saw in the United States after equal access where we
saw an explosion of fiber capacity being put in," although he notes that
such developments are subject to regulatory developments that are
"perilous to try to forecast."

  ...1996 Drivers: Telecom Reform, Cable-Telco, Internet, Technology
Improvement 

     Interviewees identified a variety of factors that will propel
market growth in 1996, including telecom reform legislation, the
struggle between cable TV companies and telephone companies to gain
larger market share, increased capacity requirements resulting from
demands for Internet access and technology improvements that will drive
new installations.
     ADC's Zogby lists drivers for growth as including cable TV fiber-
to-the-feeder and two-way network upgrades; regional Bell operating
company cable TV overbuilds; second-tier competitive access provider
growth; overall fiber optics-based, high-capacity-service demands;
increased local competition and the advent of local exchange carriers in
the inter-exchange carrier market; and more aggressive fiber optics
deployment by utilities.
     BellSouth's Mims sees increasing levels of fiber going into the
telco regions as "a natural evolution."  As you deploy more of a
particular technology, such as fiber, the cost structures come down as
the costs to your vendors come down.  Chisholm notes that the increased
functionality that fiber can provide is a major plus as telcos study
their networks.
     "It is clear that the line between local and long distance is going
to disappear," says MFS' Crowe.  Indeed, it has been clear for some time
that customers don't buy local and long-distance services because they
want to.  When the interexchange carriers move into the local exchange
that is going to mean additional construction and a good portion of that
will be fiber. 
     AT&T Corp.'s plans to enter the local exchange represents wonderful
news for consumers and the economy, Crowe believes.  From the point of
view of AT&T and the Bell operating companies, he believes it was
inevitable.  "From MFS's perspective it is great, in the short-to-medium
term it is a customer for us," says Crowe.  "It will be quite a while
before AT&T is able to deploy enough switches to carry all of its own
traffic," he predicts.
     Rick Jones, executive vice president of Broadband Technologies
Inc., believes telecom reform in the United States will be a big driver
that will cause telephone companies to build facilities in a variety of
spots.  "There will be quite a bit of attention in the local exchange
but also elsewhere," adds Jones.  "While 1996 will not be the year for
huge shipments, it will be the year people sort out what is going on and
make large orders," Jones believes.
     The Internet is having an impact, says Nortel's McFadden.  "A lot
of companies are putting people on the Internet on a day-to-day basis as
part of doing their job and that certainly is a dramatic shift from
three years ago." McFadden believes that deregulation and privatizations
are going to drive the number of second, third and fourth operators in a
lot of countries and competitive access providers are going to get even
stronger. 
     "The boom of the Internet will drive fiber optic deployment,"
predicts Sunil Tewarson, manager of new business development for AT&T
Network Systems. Tewarson notes that the U.S. government is going to be
handing over the network to private companies, that the performance is
going down below acceptable levels.  "For it to perform at the level
people accept, it will require higher speeds and that will drive fiber
deployment," says Tewarson. 
     Technology improvements will also play a role in accelerating
fiber, says Tewarson.  "In Bell Labs, we have tested the same fiber up
to speeds of 80 Gbps, 2000 channels of broadcast TV," he notes.  "There
is definitely a big technology push."

  ...Wireless Seen As Representing An Opportunity 

     Like it or not, wireless communications is having a growing impact
throughout the world.  While that will detrimentally affect fiber's
growth in some instances, it also may be an opportunity.
     Electronicast's Montgomery notes that some Asian nations deploying
wireless or personal communications require wireless antennas every 300-
400 feet that will be linked to fiber. 
     "Copper-based systems can't provide the bandwidth required to
handle all the PCS volume," says Glick.  "You need fiber." 
     As the result, Andrew Corp. is developing products that include
both fiber and copper in the same cable to the antenna (see related
information, p. 2).
     "Instead of pulling two separate cables, you can install one cable
and solve the problem of powering the antenna from the local bay
station," says Pat Estenes, senior product manager at Andrew Corp.

  ...1996 Business: Partnering to Continue, Growth of CAPs, (Re)-
Empowering AT&T

     It was clear from the learned responses of our interviewees that
much thought has been given to what business moves will be undertaken in
the coming year.  Much of that depends on, as Ryan defines it, on "the
minutiae" contained in telecom reform legislation, if it does become
law.
     There seems to be no question that roles will be changing rapidly
as shown in this anecdote from Ando's Griffin about two companies doing
business in 1996: "Today, I am your competitor; tomorrow, I am your co-
marketing partner; the week after next, one of us will buy the other;
and we will divest next month."      
     The general consensus was that there will continue to be
partnerings, such as the Sprint-Deutsche Telekom-France Telecom
partnering and the rumored alliance between Nynex and Bell Atlantic.
     "Companies such as ourselves don't have all the resources to get to
every customer," says Nortel's McFadden.  "It is very hard for one
company to cover the whole waterfront on technology developments.  You
can't afford to be limited by your own internal technological
capabilities.  There are going to be a lot more partnerships and a lot
more strategic use of these partnerships."     
     Our anonymous RHC source predicts there eventually will be an
implosion where only a few carriers eventually will be left standing. 
That jibes with comments from BBT's Jones, who says "the shaking will
begin in 1996, but the shake out will come later."
     Jones analogizes the situation to airline deregulation, "where
there were a number of mergers and a few companies that went out of
business as the landscape changed."  One common partnership will
probably be interexchange carriers and cable TV operators.  He also
believes there will be more partnering among the RHCs.
     AT&T will be a formidable foe as it enters the local exchange was
another consensus view. "I don't know if it is scary or provides an
opportunity," says Scientific-Atlanta's Wilk.  "AT&T recognition is
tremendous. If they can partner with the right providers, they are in an
absolutely tremendous position to capture a significant share not only
of the interactive data market but also of local telephony.  I think
AT&T is really something to watch next year."
     Officials from the AT&T systems and technology company--which has
about $20 billion in annual revenues--generally refused to comment for
this report, claiming they are in a quiet period until after the company
become public, expected about March 15.  AT&T Services, with about $50
billion in annual revenues, will remain a public company.  The third
company, GIS, the so-called computer company, also will not have a
public offering.   
     The systems and technology company--which includes Network Systems,
Microelectronics, Global Systems, Bell labs and Consumer Products--has
decided to create Network Cable Systems, which will combine its optical
fiber, fiber cabling, copper cables and fiber optic apparatus products
into one unit.  Units will include Norcross, Ga.; AT&T of Shanghai Fiber
Optic Co. Ltd.; Litespec Inc.; LYCOM A/S; AT&T Finolex Fiber Optic
Cables Ltd.; AT&T of Beijing Fiber Optic Cable Co. Ltd.; AT&T Fitel Co.;
AT&T Yakazi Fiber Optic Cable Co. Ltd.; AT&T Network Systems Deutschland
GmbH; AT&T Network Technologies Co. Ltd. (Bangkok, Thailand); Access
Network Technologies (Fuquay-Varina, N.C., a joint venture with
Raychem); AT&T ELECON Telesistemas C.A. (copper facility located in
Venezuela); AT&T of Tianjin, China; AT&T Network Systems Australia; and
AT&T Network Cable Systems Ireland. 

  ...Strong CAPs Seen Consolidating By Acquisition

     The competitive access providers (CAPs) are expected to continue to
aggressively plow fiber into the ground--and to consolidate for further
strength.
     Brooks Fiber President Young said his company will announce an
acquisition in coming weeks.  "Even though 1996 will not be a gangbuster
year in revenues, it will be a gangbuster year in capital expenditures,
because all of us are going to be putting in switches to go after the
biggest piece of the local dialtone market," Young confides.  Brooks
Fiber will install 8 to 10 switches in 1996 because that is all the
states will allow them to install. The company has the capability to
install 20 switches next year. 
     As we went to press, Brooks announced that it intends to invest
more than $20 million in building and operating two new fiber optic
networks in Stockton, Calif., and Jackson, Miss.  The company now will
serve 20 cities.
     "MFS is eating up other little CAPs," says Electronicast's
Montgomery.  CAPs are going to be very aggressive to position themselves
against the cable TV companies.  "They are doing this with fiber optics
deployment such as OC-3 and OC-12 SONET equipment."
     1996 will be an important year for software, several sources
observed.  "You are going to see more integration of fiber optic
products into large scale network-management, software-driven systems,"
Coppock believes.  "Software is going to be a big component."
     In the undersea market, Schaefer predicts there may be further
consolidations, such as Alcatel's earlier purchase of STC's undersea
unit.  Siemens also is trying to break into the fiber optics undersea
business--with limited success to this point.  It is also questionable
what happens to AT&T's underwater unit, known as SSI, which Schaefer
says has been the subject of industry gossip that it may be sold.
     [This is part one of a two-part series on forecasts and trends
anticipated in the fiber optics industry in the coming year.  FIBER
OPTICS NEWS interviewed more than 20 industry leaders to compile
information for this report.  Part two will run in our next issue, dated
Jan. 8, 1996.]

FIBVER OPTICS DIGEST

     Colombia's national telecommunications company has announced that
it has signed contracts with Mitsui & Co., Sirti SpA, Alcatel Cable SA
and Siemens AG as part of its fiber optics build.  The contracts are
worth a total of $112 million.

     Columbus, Ohio-based utility contractor Gudenkauf Corp. is
installing optical fiber cable together with the city.  The network will
offer high-bandwidth for power users and providers, supplying voice,
video and data.  The second phase of the network will entail
installation of 48-strand fiber cable traveling 6.62 miles and
connecting City Hall with Ohio State University and the Greater Columbus
Convention Center.  (Jeff Gudenkauf, 614/488-1776.)

     NTT has unveiled two fiber-related Track II procurements.  These
include "Optical Fiber Cables and Fiber Jointing for Aerial Access
Distribution Network" with filing deadline of Jan. 26, and "Optical
Fiber Cables and Fiber Jointing for User Distribution Network," with
filing deadline of Jan. 25.  (NTT America, Shingo Ieda, 212/808-2232.)

     Net sales of fiber optic products continue to increase for ADC
Telecommunications.  It announced that fiber sales represented 41.3
percent of total sales for the quarter ending Oct. 31, up from 35.6
percent for the year earlier period.  The company reported net income of
$18.7 million, compared to $12.8 million last year.  (Aimee Gallogly,
612/946-3338.)

     C-COR Electronics Chairman and CEO Richard Perry has announced that
the company's second quarter financial results will not meet expected
levels. It still does not have a corporate president, following the
departure of Daniel Finch. The company has received an order to supply
equipment to Titus Communications Corp. as part of a 1,050 mile hybrid-
fiber coax build in Japan.   
     Fiberguide Industries unveiled a new line of custom, single-fiber,
high-powered assemblies that are custom made.  The high-powered
assemblies are avail-able in a variety of sheathings and lengths. 
(Richard Landreth, 908/647-6601.)

     Hanh Lu has joined Lasertron as senior staff engineer for
distributed feedback lasers.  He formerly had worked at Bell Northern
Research Ltd.

     Stephanie Marshall has been named to the board of Tellabs Inc.  She
served as executive director of the Illinois Mathematics and Science
Academy.

     Brian McCann has joined the board of directors of Super Vision
International Inc..  He has spent more than eight years at 3M, where he
has been employed in the fiber optic division. 

     The New Orleans City Council has voted to let LeveeComm of
Louisiana build a perimeter fiber optics network for the city.  The
would-be carrier is still attempting to raise revenues for that purpose,
according to reports. 

     Galileo Electro-Optics Corp. gained a net profit for the first time
in the last five years, the company says in its 1995 annual report. It
had a profit of $1.1 million compared to a loss of similar value the
year before. Galileo also had the greatest commercial sales as opposed
to military sales for the period and the best productivity, as measured
by sales per employee.

     Luxtec Corp., a maker of fiber optic lighting and optical systems,
lost $6.1 million in the last quarter of fiscal 1995, compared to a net
income of $36,281 last year.  Primary reason for the loss was completion
of the CardioDyne acquisition, which involved a $5.1 million write-off.

AT&T SCORES $10 MILLION OPTICAL FIBER CONTRACT WITH DEUTSCHE TELECOM

     AT&T Corp. has received its largest contract involving optical
fiber yet from Deutsche Telekom, a $10 million deal in which the cable
will be used largely to upgrade east German infrastructure.  Roughly 90
percent of the cable will be installed in what was formerly East German,
according to AT&T.
     AT&T Network Systems fiber cable manufacturing facility in
Augsburg, Germany, will produce fiber optic cables to fill the order.
     Denmark-based LYCOM A/S, an AT&T subsidiary, will manufacture and
supply single-mode fiber to the Augsburg facility.  AT&T's Norcross,
Ga., facility also will supply single-mode fiber for the project.

ALCATEL GETS APPROVAL FOR SONET MULTIPLEXER FROM AT&T

     AT&T has approved Alcatel's 1603/12 SM synchronous optical network
multiplexer with AT&T's ACCUNET T155 service.  The Alcatel multiplexer
is one of the first tested by AT&T operating at the OC-3 rate, according
to Alcatel.
     While it unclear how much business the approval will generate,
Alcatel spokesman Mike Newsom told us the approval "is a major deal. 
They can't deny us anymore," said Newsom.
     The multiplexer offers carriers the option of an OC-3 or OC-12
configuration in a single, compact shelf, says Joe Bass, Alcatel's vice
president and general manager of lightwave products.  "The 1603/12 SM
can even operate as an OC-3 and OC-12 system at the same time,
interfacing an OC-12 line rate through one high-speed direction and OC-3
through the other high-speed direction of the same shelf."
     Test results showed that the unit can operate as a terminal
multiplexer, an add/drop multiplexer in either a linear or ring
configuration, an optical hub and a repeater as defined by the Accunet
T155 service specifications.

Cable Modems and the Future of Broadband


The hot topic at the recent Western Cable show was cable modems.  Building on
RF-to-Ethernet technology that has been around in one form or another since
the days of so-called broadband LANs, these modems, from a variety of vendors,
promise to provide residential users with access to the Internet and on-line
services at speeds in the tens of Megabits per second.  This is a quantum leap
up from the ISDN "modems" that are becoming popular among the most devoted
fans of the Net and an even bigger leap from the conventional modems that most
of us having been using to access online services for the last decade and a
half.

Cable Modems - The State of the Art?

The cable industry sees cable modems as a way that they can compete with the
telephone companies in the burgeoning Internet market.  But not quite yet.
ISDN terminal adaptors are here now and are getting cheaper by the day.  Cable
modems are only just beginning to appear, with many not slated to be on the
market until the middle of this year.  The exhibit on page 2 lists many of the
vendors that have - or will soon have - cable modem products.

At the same time, cable modems are only marginally standardized.  Most such
devices use IEEE 802.3/Ethernet MACs and 10Base-T between the PC and the
modem.  In addition, first-generation modem equipment appears to be
standardizing on 64-constellation QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)
receivers, combined with QPSK (Quadrature Phase-Shift Keyed) transmitters.
This means that, for the most part, cable modems can be used only in cable
networks that are adapted for specific modem products, while you can move your
ISDN adaptor from one ISDN service to another - although sometimes not without
difficulty.

Various groups are promising standards for cable modems before the end of this
year.  Among the standards makers for modems are CableLabs, the DAVIC group,
IEEE 802.14 and an industry group called the Broadband Link Team, which
consists of AT&T Network Systems, Hewlett-Packard Company, Hybrid Networks,
Inc., and Intel Corporation.  But for the time being, if you want high-speed
access to the Net or to AOL, Prodigy or CompuServe, buy an ISDN terminal
adaptor!

Cable Modems - the Killer App for ATM?

As the exhibit on page 3 shows, despite the fact that cable modems are early
technology, a significant number of trials are already underway for cable
modems, with some of the largest MSOs actively involved.  From the perspective
of someone interested in high-speed networking, however, the most important
trial may be that of at home, which has grasped an important truth about cable
modems.  If thousands of residential users are going to access the Net as
multi-megabit speeds, there is going to be an immediate demand for a
specialized high-speed backbone to support them.  The old slow and steady IP
routers will just not cut it.

Essentially the objective of @Home is to help cable companies around the
country to build revenues based on data services access using cable modems.
Its activities include systems integration and business process reengineering
- for example, to retrain customer support staff to handle new kinds of
digital services.

At the core of the @Home program is @Home's intention to build a national
backbone which enable operators to supply multimedia services to cable modems.
@Home would therefore function as one of the major Internet backbone
facilities, but one which was optimized for the requirements and capabilities
of cable modem users.  Facilities on this backbone would, however, be
accessible to all Internet users to the degree that this was possible using
dial-up POTS or ISDN facilities.

The @Home architecture is designed to provide a strong distribution of
resources, so that there is not too much demand on the Internet backbone.
This distribution is achieved through a hierarchy of regional data centers,
hubs and headends.  Since most modern cable network architectures are based on
a series of hubs, the architecture is not in itself unique.  However, the
@Home architecture is more geographically spread out than that envisioned by
the typical local operator and specifically incorporates ATM.  This ultimately
reflects the belief of @Home management that future multimedia services using
cable modems could overwhelm the Internet as currently constructed.

The @Home backbone will connect users to multiple sources of content.  @Home
is not directly involved in supplying content, although it is known to have
supplied advice to those developing specialized content for cable-based data
services.  Nor is @Home committed to any particular modem supplier.  However,
as noted above it is using Motorola modems in a trial and we were told that it
would also support LANCity and telephone modems.  Eventually, as standards are
developed, @Home hopes to be able to support any and all modem products.

In order to access the @Home backbone, cable systems will have to comply with
certain requirements.  These are:

- 6 MHz channel capacity - this is now standard for most cable systems

- HFC (hybrid fiber/coax) architecture - this is emerging as the
architecture-of-choice for advanced cable systems, but it is by no means
common yet.  Nor has HFC entirely eclipsed its rivals - fiber-to-curb and ADSL

- Two-way capability - this is still a rarity in the cable world

- Special headend equipment determined by modem type.

@Home believes that it will provide backbone service for about one million
homes by 1997.  @Home's economic calculations are also interesting in
understanding the market aspects of cable modem service.  According to these
calculations, it would cost cable operators about $500 to provide a
connection, from which they would receive payment of approximately $30 per
month of which $10 per month would go to @Home.  @Home would also charge
information providers for storing information on the @Home servers.

The two major financial backers of @Home are TCI and Kleiner Perkins, Caufield
and Byers, venture capitalists who have previously been involved with
financing for Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems.  With that kind of
backing, @Home should clearly be treated seriously.  For the cable industry,
the success of its new high-speed cable modems will depend on timing.  Can the
MSOs come to market with offerings based on their HFC architectures, before
the telcos also deploy HFC and similar modems.

But from the point of view of high-speed networking, it will be difficult to
put the cable modem genie back into the bottle.  These new products could be
what drives ATM into the core of cable networks and also what makes ATM the
key technology for the Internet backbone of the future.

FVC Offers New Networking Products


First Virtual Corp.  (FVC) is offering products allowing business users to
participate in enhanced desktop multimedia collaboration (DMC).  Using PCs
equipped with videoconferencing equipment and FVC's products, users can
collaborate on projects as though they were in the same room.  Examples of
DMC:

- A New York City advertising executive shows her clients a final cut of their
television commercial.  She is sitting at her PC in New York while her clients
use a PictureTel room-based videoconferencing system in Dallas.  Each party,
using four separate on-screen windows, can simultaneously view each other,
collaborate on the media schedule created as an Excel spreadsheet (passing
editing control back and forth) and view the actual video commercial, without
any degradation of audio or video quality.

- A doctor in Denver consults with a pediatric oncologist in Boston about a
patient's diagnosis.  He shows the specialist the child's test results,
patient record and X-rays, while discussing a course of treatment.  Each party
can review this information in concert, with all of the multimedia windows
open and running concurrently.

- An international retailer's facilities team based in Chicago views a video
taped store site with their team in Beijing.  Both parties can simultaneously
annotate construction estimates and review blueprint drawings while viewing a
realtime video tour of the new facility.  This application brings the Beijing
site to the retailer's desktop in Chicago.

FVC's products all operate in conjunction with its Multimedia Operating
Software (MOS), an ATM-Forum standards-based "middleware" that enables
out-of-the-box Windows applications to transparently leverage ATM's QoS
capabilities.  MOS guarantees high-speed access to applications, resulting in
multiple streams of voice, video, text, graphics and images on desktop.

FVC's new FIRST-Multimedia switches deliver ATM to the desktop at switched
Ethernet prices.  They are built with a stackable/modular architecture
allowing for a variety of scalable configurations and can scale to support
eight to 24 users per switch, 120 users per stack, and can further provide
scalability through the backbone.  The FIRST-Multimedia switches cost $300 per
25 Mbps ATM port.  They are available now and can support multimedia through
modular options including 25 Mbps ATM for the desktop, Ethernet, token-ring
for LAN access, and 155 ATM OC-3 for server of backbone switch access.
Additional modules will be available in the first half of this year to support
Fast Ethernet, SCSI, ISDN/T1 connections and NTSC for live video feeds.

The FIRST-Multimedia switch complies with ATM Forum UNI 3.0 and 3.1 switched
virtual circuit signaling and LAN emulation standards to ensure
interoperability with existing LAN data applications and other vendors' ATM
products.  These include switches and adaptors from IBM, Cisco, Bay, FORE, UB
Networks, AT&T, Adaptec, Efficient and Sun.  Because the switch is
software-based, users are assured of an easy migration path as standards
evolve.

The FIRST-Multimedia Gateway server has been enhanced to include PRI/T1
support.  The Gateway server is an ATM-Telecom Gateway that distributes remote
H.320 videoconferencing streams for the Telco WAN to the desktop over a local
ATM network.  It adds ISDN PRI and T1 WAN rates, enabling room-system quality
wide-area videoconferencing and greater capacity for multimedia traffic and
users.  The FIRST-Multimedia Gateway server enables desktop videoconferencing
clients to communicate through the server instead of a direct ISDN line for
local and WAN conferencing.  This allows ISDN lines to be shared among PCs,
eliminating the need and cost of running a separate ISDN line to each desktop.

The FIRST-WWW server enables Internet users to cache data, graphics and video
streams off of the Web in the FIRST-Multimedia storage server. This storage
cache helps facilitate fast access and playback by any users on the ATM or LAN
network. Users can now store and share commonly-used video streams, as well as
documents that incorporate video, data and images using standard Internet
browsers.

In addition to being QoS manager for out-of-the-box applications running over
ATM, MOS now enables live video streams to be encoded into MPEG-1 realtime and
then distributes them to various desktops within the organization using ATM's
point-to-multipoint features.  PC users can receive broadcast video while
performing any network activity.

FIRST-H.320 introduces development capabilities via a software developer's
tool kit for store and forward of H.320 streams.  This will allow applications
such as video mail and video session storage.  Videoconferencing users will
enjoy the same benefits as voice mail users and be able to leave a video
message.

PictureTel and FVC's partnership have allowed incorporation of room systems
into the network.  Multiple room systems, such as PictureTel's Venue*2000
systems can be connected to each other or to desktop systems through an ATM
network.

The family of FIRST-Multimedia switches is available this month and range from
$7,000 to $16,000 based on configuration options. The Gateway server will also
be available this month for $12,000. FVC's other new products and pricing will
be available in the first quarter of this year.

StrataCom Offers SVC Switching


To address increasing user requirements for more robust ATM networks,
StrataCom today announced the availability and full support of switched
virtual circuit (SVC) switching to automate connection setup and
configuration.  ATM SVCs provide three key benefits for carriers and end
users:  scalability, flexibility and ease of use.  StrataCom expects to
commence beta-testing of ATM SVCs with select customers in the first quarter
of this year.  In addition, StrataCom has unveiled ATM signaling and security
features that give users more flexibility and control across their ATM
wide-area networks.  These new features give companies the ability to prevent
unauthorized access among users.

Available as a system software upgrade, StrataCom's ATM SVCs will support ATM
user-to-network (UNI) interfaces ranging from T1/E1 (1.544/2.0 Mbps) and T3/E3
(45/34 Mbps) to OC-3/STM-1 (155 Mbps).  StrataCom ATM SVC signaling also
includes compliance with both ATM UNI 3.0 and 3.1 with translation between
these standards.  The company also said it will support ATM SVC signaling for
ATM Frame UNI and ATM Inverse Multiplexed interfaces with the delivery of
these products in the first quarter of 1996.  StrataCom also announced support
for the Interim Inter-Switch Signaling Protocol that provides interoperability
with other vendor's ATM switches and the Interim Local Management Interface
protocol for ATM connection management.

While permanent virtual circuits or PVCs must be pre-established and manually
configured, SVCs make use of ATM signaling information within each ATM cell
allowing connections to be automatically setup on-demand by switches as ATM
calls are requested by the user.  While router architectures aggregate many
users' traffic, the use of ATM SVCs permits a separate connection for each
pair of users and each application.  This allows quality of service guarantees
which are essential for multimedia communications.  Though PVCs remain
attractive for customers with a limited number of interconnected devices, as
many more users come online - as is evidenced by the growth of the Internet -
SVCs become a critical requirement.  SVCs significantly reduce network
administration by eliminating manual configuration of connections while
increasing the flexibility by which devices can be added to the network
providing quicker connectivity to all other devices.

New ATM Security Features.  Through the use of address screening (source and
destination), customers will now be able to specify, by port, a list of ATM
addresses from which users are allowed (or not allowed) to receive or initiate
SVC calls.  This feature will become a mandatory requirement in public
networking environments where large numbers of users from different companies
are connected into the same ATM service having access to all other ATM
connected devices.  StrataCom will also implement additional ATM security
mechanisms specified by the ATM Forum's new Security Working Group.

N.E.T. and Cisco Announce Agreements


N.E.T.  and Cisco Systems Inc.  have announced two agreements - one to extend
the N.E.T.  license to the full suite of Cisco Internetwork Operating System
(Cisco IOS) software, and a reseller agreement whereby N.E.T.  will resell and
support Cisco's full line of enterprise-level internetworking products.  Cisco
and N.E.T.  currently have a successful router software license agreement
dating since 1989 focusing on delivering internetworking expertise to both
companies' customers.  The N.E.T.  IDNX multiservice bandwidth manager
equipped with the N.E.T.  LAN/WAN Exchange (LWX) module is a wide-area
multiservice platform featuring a fully integrated router based on Cisco
software.  This high degree of integration gives IDNX customers
internetworking connectivity to Cisco router networks for WAN applications.

The relationship between Cisco and N.E.T.  now includes a reseller agreement
whereby N.E.T.  will sell and distribute the entire family of Cisco
internetworking products offered to enterprise-level customers.  N.E.T.  will
add value by helping customers design and integrate Cisco internetworking
products directly into IDNX multiservice backbone networks and offer contract
service direct from N.E.T.  The N.E.T.  LWX module optimizes internetwork
traffic for the WAN to give N.E.T.  IDNX customers the added benefit of
intelligent bandwidth management of router traffic for maximum trunk
utilization.  While being transported over the WAN, the router traffic can be
mixed with frame relay traffic, other types of cell or packetized traffic and
conventional circuit-switched traffic such as voice and video traffic to help
organizations save on long distance charges.  This attribute benefits
enterprise customers and global carrier/network service provider customers
alike.  As a result, Cisco networks concentrating large volumes of LAN-based
traffic can interconnect with intelligent N.E.T.  IDNX networks that carry WAN
traffic on high-capacity T1/E1 or T3/E3 digital service links.  In particular,
LAN traffic can be carried on the same trunks as voice traffic, frame relay
traffic and ISDN traffic for network optimization, efficiency, and cost
savings.

The Cisco enterprise-level internetworking products include the Cisco 7000
series of multiprotocol routers.  It also includes Cisco's access product
family, which offers an extensive selection of platforms and software sets for
regional offices, remote branch offices, and individual users.  The N.E.T.
IDNX family of multiservice bandwidth managers consists of five models with
networking functions that combine efficient multiplexing, intelligent
call-routing, LAN internetworking and routing, frame relay switching, ISDN
signaling and network management.  The IDNX systems are part of the N.E.T.
Vista Architecture, a multiservice architecture for broadband and narrowband
wide area networks.  See N.E.T.'s Web site:  http://www.net.com for further
information.

predominately internationally.  Based on information currently available, the
company expects to report net sales of approximately $10.0 million and net
income of approximately $500,000 for its fourth quarter.  These results
represent decreases from the comparable results in the third quarter ended
Sept.  30, 1995, and the fourth quarter ended Dec.  31, 1994.  These continued
uncertainties internationally, especially in the SMDS marketplace, and weaker
carrier demand are expected to adversely effect the company's operating
results for at least the next two quarters.  Digital Link will report fourth
quarter earnings on or about Jan.  24, 1996.

Cisco Invests in OSI


Cisco Systems Inc.  has made a 4.4 percent equity investment in Objective
Systems Integrators Inc.  (OSI) of Folsom, Calif., a developer of network
management software for service providers.  The announcement coincides with
OSI's initial public offering of four million shares of common stock.  As a
result of the public offering, OSI has 29.7 million shares outstanding.  Cisco
Systems is acquiring 1.3 million shares of OSI common stock (NASDAQ:  OSII) at
the initial public offering price of $19 per share.  According to Jon Shantz,
vice president of service provider market at Cisco Systems, the two companies
plan to co-develop network management applications for Cisco internetworking
technology, which will enable service providers to quickly deploy new,
enhanced internetworking services over their networks.

The two companies plan to develop enhancements to OSI's NetExpert family of
graphical user interface (GUI)-based development tools and management
applications, which allow network analysts and engineers - rather than
software programmers - to create new network operations support and management
applications or modify existing applications to support new services quickly
and easily.  NetExpert is designed to manage heterogeneous network devices,
such as computers, transmission equipment and switches, regardless of the
transmission technology, management protocols and mediums used in the network.
Customers use NetExpert for such diverse management functions as fault
management, provisioning, billing data collection, work crew dispatch, network
traffic reporting and performance analysis.

BELLCORE REFINES VIDEOCONFERENCING TOOLS

CHICAGO -- Bellcore, the research arm of the Bell companies, last
week revealed two technologies under development in its labs that
will enhance videoconferencing.

One, called the "Video Window," is a special video room with
lifelike audio and a curved wide screen, for displaying life-size
images of groups of from six to 12 people.

The other is a computer program called Rendezvous, designed to
create the "conversational props" that Bellcore believes
videoconferees must have in order to exchange graphic
information.

The two technologies, demonstrated here at the National
Communications Forum earlier this month, both arise from what
Bellcore researchers say is a psychological assessment of
videoconferencing user needs.

Referring to the Video Window, Eric Addeo, Bellcore's district
manager for visual services research, said researchers found that
videoconferees "want to be able to see the person and have a
sense of eye contact."

The Bellcore researchers emphasized that neither technology is
far from commercialization.  According to Addeo, the Video Window
can run at speeds from 45 megabits per second to 384 kilobit per
second, a quarter of a T1 line.  Video Window, he added, is based
on the CCITT H.261 standard, codecs for which will be available
by late next year.

Video Window's 64 Kbps voice channel, meanwhile, offers full-
duplex audio that is unaffected by increases in volume, he added.

In his presentation on Rendezvous, Bellcore's Louis Gomez
demonstrated the software in a application where two children in
separate homes connected their computers over phone lines and
played the card game "fish."  Rendezvous allowed each player to
have a personalized display that showed only the faces of their
own cards, while also giving them a view of the common "pool,"
where they discarded cards.

In business videoconferencing, Gomez elaborated, Rendezvous could
be used to create a conversational prop such as a shared "white
board," a part of each party's viewing screen where they could
make real-time drawings or notes.

The use of conversational props will lengthen telephone calls and
increase demand for broadband service, predicted Gomez, a manager
in human-computer systems research.

Addeo, meanwhile, emphasized the user friendliness of a Video
Window room, which automatically connects with its remote
counterpart the minute its door is opened.

Bellcore tests, he elaborated, showed users pleased with Video
Window -- and willing to buy it.  Since Bellcore cannot
manufacture products, Addeo said the organization hopes it can
induce a telecommunications company to bring the technology to
market.  To that end, Bellcore will hold a seminar on Video
Window Oct. 10.

VIDEOCONFERENCING INTEGRATOR DESIGNS FOR WIDE RANGE OF USERS

While TV news crews in Kuwait broadcast live reports on the Iraqi
invasion, General Norman Schwarzkopf was using satellite-based
video to ready American armed forces for the coming war.

Schwarzkopf was using the live video link -- essentially, a
videoconference -- to command American military forces during a
computerized war game, in which generals fought against a
software "enemy" and no troops were deployed.

The war game -- done strictly on computers to keep costs and
personal risks low -- involved commanders at three U.S. Air Force
bases in northern Florida, one of them Schwarzkopf's command
post.

When Iraq invaded, the general ordered his personal staff of
commanders, located "behind the lines" at a Tampa, Fla., airbase,
to give him the "real stuff," according to Kenneth Lucas, senior
program manager at CAE Link, a designer of military training
systems.  A secure satellite link was set up between Tampa and
the general's field headquarters to feed maps and other graphic
information to Schwarzkopf.

CAE Link, whose name is more frequently associated with flight
simulators, designed that videoconferencing system -- the first,
Lucas believes, to be used in a combat simulation.

In the aftermath of the war game, Col. Dennis Foggy, chief of the
support division of the Joint Warfare Center, which organized the
event, said he found "videoconferencing works well conjunction
with war game simulation because exercize participants can see
and share data and information in real time, in color and without
delay."

The videoconferenced portion of the war game was carried at 384
kilobits per second and ran non-stop for 10 days with no
problems, the Joint Warfare Center said.  More recently, the
system was run at a low 256 Kbps for a second simulated war game
"with only minimum sacrifice to video quality," Foggy says.

The American subsidiary of a Canadian aerospace firm, CAE Link
designs training systems, mainly for the military, and assembles
custom videoconferencing systems, largely for use in "distance
learning."  Distance learning uses videoconferencing technology
to link a teacher in one classroom with students in remote
classrooms, often in areas too sparsely settled to have such
instruction.

Schools Via Satellite

Among its distance learning clients are the Western Kentucky
Educational Consortium, universities in Alabama, Tennessee and
Florida and the Nebraska State Telecommunications and Education
Commission, whose 11-site system is the largest the company has
installed to date and involves satellite broadcasts to some
remote areas of the state.

Another system put together by Binghamton, N.Y.-based CAE Link
lets anyone anywhere in the United States study for a masters
degree in instructional technology at Boise State University --
without relocating to Idaho.  Students attend classes in their
homes via computer conferencing.

Systems integration is especially important in distance learning
because off-the-shelf videoconferencing products usually are
designed for corporate meetings, Lucas says.

The equipment is often built into a roll-about cart and cannot
provide coverage to an entire classroom, where anyone may
suddenly ask a question, Lucas said.  A particularly thorny
problem in those settings is audio, since some students may
speak-out too quietly or be located too far from a microphone,
adds Operations Manager Rich Grace.

CAE Link's distance learning systems are composed of equipment
from various suppliers, including PictureTel and VideoTelecom.
The hardware is in turn matched with the right telecommunications
medium for the job, from T1 to switched 56 kilobit lines, or
whatever the customer already has in place.

While educational institutions can design distance learning
systems themselves, Lucas said "the problem [for customers] is
knowing what to buy -- we've been through that via trial and
error."

Because of its training systems business, CAE Link employs
instructional designers, who can advise first-time distance
learning buyers on how to teach remotely, Lucas said.  One tip:
have instructors teaching a classroom of students at the
broadcast site.

To assist the activities of the company's training side,
meanwhile, it hosts a videoconferencing room on the Sprint
Meeting Channel at the Alexandria, Va., headquarters of its
Training Systems Division.

In another intra-company synergy, CAE Link's national network of
flight simulator support centers also support its
videoconferencing systems.

A typical distance learning network put together by the company
is its first installation, which which links a Navy classroom in
Newport News, Va., with seven other classrooms in the East from
Rhode Island to Florida.

Switched Video Signals

Using a "video PBX," which switches the signal to the appropriate
sites, an instructor in one classroom can simultaneously teach at
other sites, with cameras at each site giving him visual contact
with his students once a minute.  The satellite-based network
itself is encrypted and can link up to three classes
simultaneously, Lucas noted.

The network, which provides instruction to sailors and
videoconferencing for officers, last year made its first
broadcast to a Navy ship, albeit one in port at the Norfolk, Va.,
naval base.  There the signal went, via cable, from a dish on the
dock to a classroom three stories below deck.

In its final stages of preparation, though, is a new system that
will take the company from the education into the medical sector.
That system, which is expected to make headlines late this month,
will use videoconferencing technology to let doctors to do a
"remote diagnosis," a benefit to rural areas and other locales
where there are few physicians.

VIDEOCONFERENCING APPLICATIONS CREATE VERTICAL MARKET SEGMENTS

As it matures, the videoconferencing market has become more
segmented, with vendors targetting specific industries from
education and government to pharmaceuticals.

Market segmentation is "just starting to happen in
videoconferencing, where different vendors' strengths in
different market areas are becoming apparent..." observes Jim
Posko, marketing manager at AT&T Business Video.

One supplier, Compression Labs Inc. (CLI), says in its latest
annual report that its "base business has benefitted
substantially from major thrusts made by CLI into selected
vertical markets such as government and education."

What are the hot vertical markets?  Henry Grove III, vice
president of the audio/video systems division of Peirce-Phelps
Inc., a well-known systems integrator, cites pharmaceuticals,
defense, finance, insurance and aerospace.

Greg Cline, an analyst with Information Strategies Group in
Vienna, Va., sees vertical markets in government, executive
communications, project management, distance learning, strategic
defense, comand and control, emergency management and law
enforcement.  And Dataquest Inc., the San Jose, Calif., market
research firm, cites retailing, transportation, electronics and
communications.

The university and distance learning markets are hot, and state
government is about to heat up, says Gail Cisel, a product
manager in charge of the state government, university and
correctional facility markets for US Sprint.

Sprint is about to announce videoconferencing support over the
State Interconnected Government Network (SIGN), a program of
discounts on customer premise equipment and usage time, and guest
speakers with applications background that targets government.

Market-Watching From Afar

Within a vertical market, videoconferencing is often used to
maintain contact with branch offices and across time zones.
AT&T's Posko, for instance, notes that one investment house makes
"morning video calls to London, where it gets updated on how the
Far Eastern and European stock exchanges fared during the night.
That analysis allows it to determine how to react as the Wall
Street exchanges open."

Insurance companies "being decentralized ... saw the usefulness
of videoconferencing to introduce new products and policies to
take them to the field [offices]," Grove elaborates.  American
General and Aetna, he says, have videoconferencing in over 40
locations.

Segmenting the market is not only done by industry, Grove
explains.  "There are applications that cross industries, such as
legal applications," he observes.  "You can find these
applications in corporate legal departments, in law firms and in
courts."

Another way the market is segmented is by bandwidth.  Kathleen
Flaherty, vice president of large accounts at MCI Communications
Corp., says PictureTel's products and MCI's Switched 56 service
are positioned to support the fastest growing market segment:
meetings using videoconferencing speeds of 384 kilobits per
second and slower.

Factors Of Size, Speed

AT&T's Posko also sees the market as segmented by bandwidth.
"There's group conferencing with a single screen used for small
groups of one to four people that are highly interactive and
spontaneous meetings, but use 112 Kbps.  Next is the departmental
level with three to six people at each end.  It's more formal,
used for project overviews, staff meetings and this type of
meeting would be a bit higher bandwidth and probably include a
dual-screen setup.

"Corporate conferencing is next.  It's more expensive, uses dual
or triple screens, is for up to 12 people and uses higher
bandwidths too," he says.

Other suppliers are pointing to a different advantage:
application-specific public video rooms.  "A unique network has
sprung up," says Todd Clayton, vice president of marketing for
VideoTelecom.

"Depositions are usually taken by lawyers getting on planes with
court reporters to visit witnesses in person for testimonies.
But court reporter firms have set up a network called LINC [Legal
Image Network Communications] to take video depositions," says
Clayton, who envisions similar networks serving personnel
recruiters or real-estate brokers.

(The Miami-based LINC network uses VideoTelecom codecs and
consists of rooms installed in the offices of about 20 different
independent court reporters.)

Another product differentiator, high resolution graphics, cuts
across markets horizontally, says Grove.  High-resolution
graphics, he elaborates, are important to any industry "that
conducts meetings with a lot of spreadsheets, wants to display
hard copies, or looks at documentation of any sort ... ."  This
includes the Defense Department, insurance industry, and even
NASA, which has been using high-resolution graphics systems
before any launch, he says.

NASA has had "interactive sign-offs with any top officials since
the Challenger disaster," he adds.

Tim McElgunn, an analyst at market researcher Datapro, says
videoconferencing suppliers are increasingly making other
companies partners in their vertical market strategy, seeking out
those with compatible corporate cultures.  "VideoTelecom, for
instance, is PC LAN- [and] data communications-oriented and
therefore goes after firms with the same mindset of technology
implementation -- smaller firms with a PC orientation," he
observes.

One set of partners with a key role are resellers, some of whom
are doing the actual vertical marketing themselves.  "None of the
vendors are huge," explains McElgunn, "so they rely on their Bell
[company] contacts who jointly market their products to Bell
accounts.  Feedback from these resellers will tell vendors what
specific features an individual industry wants."

System Matches Application

VideoTelecom's Clayton, meanwhile, credits resellers with his
firm's success in the education market.  "We have designed a user
interface that's tailored to instructor training," he explains.
"We were able to create a solution for their particular needs."

One systems integrator Videoconferencing Systems, Inc. (VSI), of
Norcross, Ga., says it is targeting markets by exhibiting at
trade shows, including the Computer and Office Systems Show in
Atlanta.  According to Marketing Coordinator Norah Sowa, the
company is aiming for the legal, state governments,
pharmaceutical, medical and education vertical markets.

Another partner in vertical marketing can be a helpful trade
association.  For instance, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association, "helped the industry embrace [videoconferencing]
technology several years ago," says Peirce-Phelps' Grove.
"Merck, Ciba-Geigy and a few others saw videoconferencing relate
to the product development cycle [by] shortening it.  And if that
cycle is cut by even a week, these firms save a million dollars."

For the future, Dataquest sees an expanded vertical market for
videoconferencing among more small and midsize organizations, who
will be attracted as the prices of these products decline and
lower  speed transmission becomes more available.

Reduced transmission costs can only expand the market said a
spokesman for PictureTel, which is based in Peabody, Mass.  "When
you can sell videoconferencing to customers using two telephone
lines that cost only $20 an hour from coast to coast at 112 Kbps,
then you can sell lower down the line to [departmental]
managers," the spokesman says.

"And distance learning applies here as well," he adds.  "We're
finding that 112 Kbps is great for educational systems that don't
have a whole lot of money to burn."

INSURER'S VIDEOCONFERENCING CUTS TRAVEL TIME, BOOSTS TRAINING

In the last three years, John Hancock Financial Services of
Boston has relied on first one, then two business television
(BTV) networks to bring its 17,000 employees closer together.

This company -- whose insurance business alone has $32 billion in
assets -- has used an in-house television studio for more than 20
years.  Yet by upgrading its equipment to handle live
transmissions, John Hancock's group and retail insurance
companies and some of its other businesses have realized BTV's
advantages -- savings in travel costs, reaching 30 times as many
people for each class, and a decreasing need to take seminars on
the road to regional locations for weeks at a time.

With its point-to-multipoint system, the company uses two
satellite networks for product update meetings, field sales
training, sales contest updates, recruiting and a wide variety of
corporate communications events.  The company has held about 70
broadcasts since 1988.

This one-way video, two-way audio system can delivery full-motion
video from corporate headquarters to 42 field offices.  Several
hundred people watching a broadcast can ask questions, even
though they can't be seen on screen.

John Hancock rents satellites by the hour or the half-day only
when needed.  The company owns neither a satellite or an uplink
transmitter.  Field offices have been equipped with satellite
dishes on the roof or in a parking lot and electronics that
descramble the picture and allow them to select the right
channel.

Usually 25 or 30 people at each office can watch a live
presentation on a 25-inch color TV, or tape it off the satellite
on a VCR.

"The typical format is about 80 percent live material, which
usually means [having] people in our studio talking," said Frank
King, John Hancock's general director of corporate
communications, who manages the two satellite networks.

"People in the field can talk via a special telephone hookup from
their offices," he said.  "We also have pre-taped news segments
or information about a new computer application, for example.
Almost every broadcast has a live question and answer period at
the end."

The company invested in BTV network equipment rather than two-way
interactive videoconferencing because it was more economical, and
it was a natural fit for linking its distant locations.  The
company is also adding about 100 new satellites in the
continental United States to the system.

"We have a single headquarters in Boston and our 17,000 employees
and retail sales organizations are spread over great distances,
which dictated a point-to-multipoint set up," King said.  "In the
vast majority of cases, we don't need to see the field people; we
just need to hear them."

John Hancock management currently is weighing the pros and cons
of having videoconferencing rooms that could accommodate two-way
video as well.

"Since we do not have regional headquarters organizations,
there's no crying need for an interactive video system.  Even if
we decide to do it, we wouldn't do away with BTV," King said.
"The difference would still be the ability to hold two-way
meetings with fewer people as opposed to bringing a broadcast to
several hundred in more than 100 locations."

MID-SIZED OFFICE BUILDINGS NEXT STEP IN BELL CANADA FIBER ROLL-
OUT

CHICAGO -- If a telco has deployed fiber to large office
buildings -- a typical first step -- its next step should be to
focus on medium-sized office buildings, rather than homes.  At
least, that is the conclusion of Bell Canada, which expects to
begin deploying fiber to mid-sized office buildings in major
Canadian cities later this year.

In the long term, Bell Canada wants to bring fiber to homes,
rather than just to the curb, even though it expects this to be
the more costly strategy, said Bernard Chenevert, the company's
associate director of network systems research.

Bell Canada, however, lacks a major incentive that could promote
the deployment of fiber to homes.  For instance, it cannot
broadcast video, said Chenevert, who spoke at a panel
presentation on fiber implementation at the National
Communications Forum here last week.

Were telcos not constrained by such regulation, Chenevert said it
might make technical and economic sense for a telco to use its
fiber network to distribute a cable TV operator's signals to
homes.

Last year the company put its fiber-to-the-home plans on
indefinite hold, aiming instead for mid-sized buildings having
1,500 to 3,000 lines.  Tests have since shown the company can
bring fiber to a mid-sized building for nearly the cost of using
copper wire, he said.

Besides supplying telephone service, the fiber Bell Canada is
running to office buildings will be used to support
videoconferencing, DS-1 services and data services, Chenevert
said.  After it brings fiber to mid-sized office buildings, the
next step in Bell Canada's fiber deployment plan is to aim for
large and medium-sized apartment buildings, he said.

NTT DEBUTS 3-D TV AT TELECOM '91 -- SANS GLASSES

GENEVA -- I have seen the future and it nearly hit me in the
face.  Well, it seemed to.

Dancers writhed, flower arrangements twirled, swordsmen menaced
me with their weapons.  All on television -- jumping out of the
screen.

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) is showing off three-
dimensional television here at Telecom '91, the world's largest
telecom trade show.

In two small booths, reminiscent of  the alcoves where AT&T's
Picturephone was demonstrated at the 1964 New York World's Fair,
NTT displayed a three-dimensional, full-color, full-motion
television picture that can be viewed without special glasses.

The screen is roughly the size of a 14-inch personal computer
monitor turned on end, 15 inches diagonally to be exact.  The
whole package, minus the electronics hidden behind the display,
is about the size of a large carry-on airline bag.

Don't look for this television in stores.  "This is only a
prototype.  We think we can do much better," said Nobuji
Tetsutani, senior research engineer in NTT's Visual Media
Laboratory in Kanagawa, Japan.  The required 4 megaHertz analog
signal, received by the TV via cable, requires too much bandwidth
and has other limitations that now make it impractical as a
consumer product.

The viewer must stand about three feet to four feet from the
screen.  Outside that range, the 3-D effect is lost.  The
television's picture is bright and clear with approximately the
resolution of a fair-quality home TV.

Separate sets of pixels -- one for each eye -- and an unusual,
full-length lenticular lens appear to release the dancers,
flowers and swordsmen from the screen's bounds.  The lens
surfaces bend the light from the pixels so that each eye sees a
different set of pixels.

NTT says an infrared sensor detects head movements and adjusts
the images left  or right to compensate for head movement.  In
practice, this works poorly.  When I moved, portions of the
screen dimmed momentarily.  When I moved two feet to the right of
the screen, still sitting about three feet in front of it, the
mirage collapsed into a flat picture.

The picture need not be viewed in darkness.  NTT said the device
produces  "compelling images in a bright room," although the
booths were dimly lit.

CONSUMER ONLINE AUDIENCE TOPS 11.3 MILLION USERS, UP 79% DURING
1995

By Gary H. Arlen, Senior Contributing Editor

     Expanded marketing campaigns by the leading consumer online
services during the fourth quarter, plus brisk response to the
launch of the Microsoft Network (MSN), brought the consumer online
audience to 11,304,200 customers at the end of 1995 - a staggering
78.9 percent increase above the 6,320,650 tally at the end of 1994. 
During the fourth quarter of 1995, for the second consecutive
period, the subscriber base grew at a rate of 15 percent.

     As the biggest online services get bigger, smaller ventures
(mostly ones with regional or specialty focus) continue to survive,
validating that niche services with unique content and reasonable
prices can survive, if not thrive.  The six largest national/global
online services now represent 96.9 percent of the customer base, up
from 92 percent three months ago.  The three largest operators
alone reach 10.1 million users, or 89.3 percent of the total
audience.

     America Online Inc. (AOL) continued to fuel the growth at an
18 percent pace; the company expects to pass the 5 million user
mark by early February - benefiting (as are all the major
operators) from the sign-ups by consumers who got new computers or
modems during the recent holiday season.  MSN jumped 200 percent in
the October-November-December period, to 600,000 users.

     Not only has the subscriber base grown, so has the usage.  AOL
last month marked the first time its single-day accesses exceeded
1 million hours - a benchmark accompanied by denied log-ons and
slow processing, as many users have noted.

     CompuServe Inc.'s growth was boosted by strong overseas
increases, especially in Europe, where its subscriber base climbed
by 25 percent.  AOL is expected to begin registering offshore users
this year, either directly or through its alliances in Europe,
Australia and other regions.

     Among the largest systems, Prodigy Services Co. dropped
slightly, amid reports by IISR sources that its parent companies
are seeking to sell (or possibly give away) the operation.  GEnie,
which has been unable to attract a buyer in the last several
months, continues to limp along at about 70,000 users.

Dramatic Changes On the Way

     The year-end tally comes just as the nature and direction of
online services is about to change dramatically.  The online
industry's relationship to Internet services (beyond offering World
Wide Web and Internet access) still is being refined.  In addition,
existing operations will be overhauled, starting with this month's
migration of Delphi Internet Services Corp. into parent company
News Corp./MCI Online Venture's Web-based "iGuide" service.

     Online newspapers and banking services also are showing
increasing vitality.  Several publishers are abandoning or cutting
back their traditional online services (notably the Los Angeles
Times backing off from Prodigy) to concentrate on Web sites.  Other
major publishers, notably The New York Times, are preparing for
their imminent Web debuts while maintaining online presence (such
as @Times on AOL, in this case).

     USA Today stopped charging for its proprietary service as it
concentrates on its Web site.  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch's
PostLink system, one of the earliest online newspaper services,
closed at the end of December to be replaced by a Web site during
the next few months.

     Nearly 40 major banks are just starting to roll out services
based on the software deals made last year to build home banking
systems based on Microsoft Corp.'s "Money," Intuit Corp.'s
"Quicken" or Meca Software LLC's "Managing Your Money" financial
programs.  The pioneering banks still are leery about revealing
initial sign-up responses.

Around the Online Circuit

     Delphi Internet (which has existed in various incarnations
since 1982), officially will be absorbed this month by "iGuide,"
the Web-based service that has been developed by News Corp./MCI
Online Ventures.  Existing customers have been invited to
participate in a beta test of the new service.  Since Delphi itself
has done no promotion since early 1995, attrition has lowered the
user base.

     Prodigy's 7 percent drop in users comes despite a new
marketing campaign aimed at finding younger, hipper customers; the
decline indicates that customers are churning off at a faster pace
than new ones are signing on.  Part of the problem with measuring
Prodigy's precise audience is the company's acknowledgment that it
reaches about 1.6 million homes; Prodigy also contends that each
household has about two users, up slightly from the 1.8 average of
the past few years.  A company spokesman insists that the company's
"official" tally is "more than 2 million users," even though the
data suggest that just over 3 million customers (1.6 million homes
with two users each) access the service.

     Prodigy officials also decline to discuss the company's future
ownership status.  Independent sources indicate that IBM Corp. and
Sears, Roebuck & Co. have been unable to find any buyers for
Prodigy.  Sears even attempted to unload its interest to IBM. 
There even have been indications that the broker representing
IBM/Sears has offered to "give away" the service to another online
company if a suitable arrangement could be developed for IBM/Sears
to own a share of the acquiring entity.  None of the companies
involved will discuss the 1996 outlook for Prodigy.

     GEnie's fate is similarly fuzzy, although parent General
Electric Information Services Co. is trying to spruce up the
operation before a sale.  Connection speeds of up to 28.8 kilobits
per second (Kbps) were introduced in late 1995, and full Internet
access has been implemented.  Earlier in the year, GEnie introduced
a new graphical user interface and eliminated prime-time
surcharges.  The company claims it has the "biggest group of loyal
members" among the nationwide online services - a selling point in
its effort to find a buyer.

     CompuServe is adding 200,000 subscribers per month and now has
reached 4,000,000 subscribers.  Of these, 200,000 are in the United
Kingdom and 300,000 elsewhere in Europe.  The company said it
"plans to double" the United Kingdom figure in the next 12 months,
and has added machine translation capabilities to translate
electronic mail, forum messages and other documents between
English, French, Spanish and German at the user's request.

     ImagiNation Network (INN) has been testing lower weekday rates
from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. for its subscribers who do not use preferred
access nodes of parent company AT&T Corp.  The special rates, which
began Nov. 22, 1995, are scheduled to expire Jan. 15.  INN is
evaluating whether to continue the lower rates or adopt another
marketing incentive.

     Reuters Money Network will introduce several new services
during the coming months as part of an overall upgrade of the
service; details are not yet available.

     New York Online has stopped promoting its current online
service as it makes the transition to a Web site, due to debut at
the end of January.  Web content will be updated daily.  The
company now calls its 2-year-old online service "an intermediate
step" to the Web and "more of a brochure."

     Mnematics Videotex Inc. has added points of presence in
Rockland and Orange counties, New York, expanding the reach of its
metropolitan New York City service.

     In addition to operating its own stand-alone service, MPGNet
provides interactive multiplayer games on the MSN; the company said
there are other providers of games to MSN but that only MPGNet has
interactive games.

     SeniorNet has 78 centers across the country and currently
serves about 5,000 subscribers.  The service, long available via
America Online Inc. (AOL), now also is accessible on the MSN and
via its Web site at www.seniornet.org.

     PSINet Inc., which recently launched a regional radio
advertising campaign for its consumer Internet access service, is
compiling an aggregate subscriber total for its three systems -
Pipeline USA, Pipeline New York and PSI InterRamp.  The company
will not break that count into each component service.

Community Services Grow Slowly

     Although the big push toward the Internet has not hindered the
creation of new regional and local services, most are including
Internet access in their offerings.

     The Well has put its conferencing system on its Web site,
which can be accessed at www.well.com.

     Hawaii FYI is "renovating" its service and logs about 160,000
minutes of use per month.  It has created a Web site, and bridged
the service with its Internet server Jan. 2.  Its subscriber base
of 15,000 "has been stable for about a year."

     Greater New Orleans Free-Net, which began in 1994 under the
aegis of the University of New Orleans, has become an independent
nonprofit organization and now reaches more than 12,000
subscribers.  Three major groups fund the organization:  the
Chamber of Commerce of New Orleans and the River Region, the New
Orleans Public Library and nine parish school boards.  The service
is text-based only; graphics are available only for content
providers that must also be nonprofit organizations.

     Heartland Regional Net (which has dropped its "free-net
appellation) now counts 8,500 subscribers, of whom 1,900 log on
each day.  It offers an enhanced level of service for users who
contribute $35 per year.  That fee covers two-thirds of its user
budget; 69 percent of those using the enhanced service sign up
again in succeeding years.

     National Capital Freenet of Ottawa celebrated reaching the
50,000-subscriber mark with a ceremony attended by the mayor of
Ottawa and other government officials.  The service expects to have
a Web site in operation by the end of the second quarter.

     Toronto Free-Net is developing a Web site through Lynx and
Gopher; it will be available in the first quarter.

Newspapers Finding More Web Homes

     USA Today Online has dropped all charges for its online
service, and it no longer main-tains a subscriber count.  Its Web
site (www.usatoday.com) contains 15,000 pages and is designed to be
supported by advertising revenues.  The Web site is averaging 1.6
million hits per day.

     TimesLink, the online service of the Los Angeles Times,
dropped its presence on the Prodigy platform Dec. 31.  TimesLink
will offer its current base of about 17,000 subscribers the
opportunity to participate in a beta test of its new Web site, now
under development and due to be available to the public late in the
first quarter.

     Houston Chronicle Interactive (HCI), the cyberarm of the
Houston Chronicle, unveiled a partnership with Prodigy in November
in an attempt to leverage the best of both the online and Web
worlds.  HCI, a Web-based service, promotes Prodigy as the
preferred method to access its Web site, and receives a bounty for
each new Prodigy subscriber it generates.  For its part, Prodigy
maintains an HCI-branded area on its service, allowing its members
to access the HCI Web site and providing the Texas newspaper with
a higher profile than possible on the Web alone.  The two companies
will share revenue based on traffic in the HCI Web site and the
HCI-branded area on Prodigy.

     Mercury Center, the online service of the San Jose Mercury
News, uses as its subscriber number the figure for all AOL
subscribers in the Mercury News circulation area.  The service
declines to disclose the number of hits on its own Web site.

     Electronic Trib, the online service of the Albuquerque
Tribune, has added business news from Financial Times.  The service
features prices of the 1,600 most active stocks on the New York
Stock Exchange and 3,000 of the largest mutual funds.

     Access Atlanta is redesigning its 1996 Olympics Web site and
developing new home pages, the first of which will go online by
March.

     PostLink, the online service of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
closed Dec. 31.  It is to be replaced by a Web site during the next
few months.

     StarText, the online service of the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram,
started its Web site in December (www.startext.net).  Rates are
$19.95 if StarText is the sole Internet provider and $4.95 for
readers who use another Internet provider.

     Tampa Bay Online developed a College Bowl Game package
covering all the New Year's weekend bowl activities.  It also
launched a Web site at www.tampatrib.com.

     Fred the Computer, the online service of the Middlesex News,
has 2,200 subscribers to its free service.  That figure represents
readers who have logged on through any of the six newspapers in the
Massachusetts region served by the parent Community Newspaper
Company.  The service has doubled the number of news groups
requested by local customers, and it currently is developing
Internet projects.  Content includes news, Usenet and e-mail
Internet access.

Telebanking Services Added in Some Regions

     Citibank on the PC, the free online banking service of
Citibank, quietly rolled out in Florida; service is being promoted
to customers in Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties and the
cities of Clearwater and Madeira Beach.  Heavy promotion is slated
for the coming months after a low-key, unpromoted "live test" that
began last fall.

     Bank of America's "HomeBanking" online service is being
updated to integrate into commercial online and Internet services. 
The Internet package can be reached at www.bankamerica.com.  An
AOL-accessible version will debut by March; when that occurs, the
proprietary service, which has not been marketed for years, will be
restructured and promoted.

     Chase Direct, the heavily promoted online banking service of
Chase Manhattan Bank, has received 110,000 telephone queries and
7,400 e-mail inquiries about the service, and has mailed out 31,000
information kits.

     US Order has teamed with Colonial Data Technologies Corp. to
introduce Telesmart 4000, an analog display services interface
(ADSI) telephone with several advanced functions.  The phone can be
used to send e-mail via the Internet, pay bills and bank
electronically, type and send messages directly to pagers, shop
from catalogs electronically and receive advanced new forms of
Caller ID from telephone companies.  It can access electronic
directory assistance to search national databases and visually
display telephone numbers and addresses.

Outlook for 1996

     Aside from the fate of GEnie or Prodigy and or the shifting
status of the MSN, there is no reason to believe that the industry
will not continue to grow and its market presence expand in 1996.

     The largest services - AOL and Compuserve in particular - will
remain strong even as they try to weigh the trend toward Internet
and Web-based services and cement their relationships with content
suppliers and customers.

     At the same time, content suppliers are trying to determine
the best - and most valuable - outlets for their material.  The
generally small fees paid by commercial online operators may exceed
the pittance generated via the Web's current financial structure. 
Hence, some information providers may choose to stay with and
support online ventures because of the known (albeit small) revenue
they generate.

     And meanwhile, although brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont agreed
to drop its $200 million libel suit against Prodigy (see story, p.
8) for remarks made about the company on one of the company's
bulletin boards, the judge handling the case rejected Prodigy's
attempt to reargue his finding that Prodigy is a publisher and thus
responsible for all content on its bulletin boards, so the suit
technically is still alive.  However, the telecommunications reform
bill pending in Congress contains a clause that protects online
services from libel suits such as that filed by Stratton Oakmont,
and, if passed, that effectively would nullify the judge's attempt
to set a dangerous and expensive precedent for the online industry.

     This also will be the year the heavy hand of government will
be felt by the online services.  There has been a well-publicized
yearlong battle on the part of some members of Congress to curb
allegedly obscene material online.  But also looming are efforts by
federal lawmakers and regulators to control online shopping
services and ban online gambling outright.  Moreover, a number of
states are considering levying taxes on users of online services,
a move that could turn operators into tax collectors and dampen
consumer demand for online services.

INTERCHANGE OFFLINE NETWORK? 

      AT&T Corp. plans to take its Interchange Online Network, an
elegant, albeit it woefully undersubscrib-ed proprietary publishing
platform, offline.  AT&T's New Media Services division will instead
redirect its online efforts at developing Web-based services.

     "The Interchange Online Network as we know it today will phase
out over the course of the next year," said Michael Kolowich,
president of AT&T New Media Services.  By that time, he said, "the
Web will be a superior environment to online services." 

     Kolowich's comments were made during a teleconference to
announce that AT&T's fledgling online service for professionals,
AT&T Business Network, will be available as a Web-based service by
midyear.  By the close of 1996, Kolowich said, the Web will replace
the company's Interchange Online Network as the principle means of
distribution for the service, which will be known as AT&T Business
Network Version 2.

Business Network Moves to Web

     Exactly how much access to "Version 2" will cost has not been
disclosed, nor is it clear how much of Interchange's look and feel
will be retained in cyberspace.  The current Interchange-based
service costs $39.95 a month for 10 hours of use, and $2.95 for
each additional hour.  The Business Network offers Internet access,
the Netscape Navigator Web browser, and content from the likes of
Dow Jones & Co. Inc., Dun & Bradstreet Corp., Cable News Network
and others.  

     Whether New Media Services will charge for full access to its
pending Web-based service or adopt a pay-as-you-go approach also
has yet to be determined.  Although "Version 2" will be available
to anyone with Internet access and a Web browser, Kolowich said,
New Media Services plans to market the new Business Network service
together with AT&T's WorldNet Internet access service.

     Although the Jan. 4 announcement was designed to center around
the migration of the Business Network to the Web and all its
inherent advantages, the real news was the fact that Ma Bell
effectively has given Interchange the kiss of death.  Along with
Interchange, New Media Services also has abandoned its
much-explained-yet-much-misunderstood strategy of acting as a
proprietary publishing platform for other online services, a
business model that failed to bear much fruit, or attract many
subscribers.

     Indeed, since Interchange was launched last June, the combined
subscriber base of its various services that include  Ziff-Davis
Interactive, The Gartner Group, the Washington Post's Digital Ink
and Star-Tribune Online only numbers in the several tens of
thousands (AT&T won't say exactly how many), which is about as many
customers as America Online Inc. signs up in a good week.

     Kolowich said all of Interchange's "publishing partners" also
plan to launch Web-based services, and added that AT&T is
supporting their endeavors to that end.  The Gartner Group, for
one, announced just such a move earlier last week, and the
Star-Tribune released a similar statement hours after the AT&T
announcement (see story, p. 4).  When all AT&T and its "partners"
have abandoned ship for the Web, AT&T will pull the plug on
Interchange, a bleeding-edge product before the advent of the Web.

Taking a Write-Off

     Although New Media Services repeatedly has stressed its
commitment to open standards and Web-based products since its
inception little more than a year ago, the unit was in fact built
on a proprietary foundation - Interchange's software - for which
AT&T now is paying the price.  Kolowich acknowledged AT&T will be
taking an undisclosed write-off for Interchange, which the company
purchased from Ziff Communications Inc. for a reported $50 million
in late 1994. 

     An AT&T spokeswoman, however, stressed that New Media Services
will not be affected by the massive round of layoffs announced by
AT&T last week.

     New Media Services will release what is likely to be
Interchange's final upgrade later this quarter, and an upbeat
Kolowich claimed the division has received more than 100,000
requests for Business Network software in the past several weeks.

     With the announcement, AT&T joins an expanding club of online
service providers whose best-laid proprietary plans were undermined
by the phenomenal rise of the World Wide Web during the past year. 

      In December, Microsoft Corp. announced its intention to
reposition its Microsoft Network as a Web-based service.  In late
November, Europe Online, which had planned to launch a service
based on AT&T's software platform, prefigured its partner (and 9.8
percent shareholder) by abandoning Interchange in the 11th hour and
launching a Web-based service Dec. 15.  And in September, Apple
Computer Inc. announced that its eWorld online service will become
an Internet-based service by midyear.

     Although the "Big Three" proprietary online services continue
to add subscribers at a dizzying pace, some industry watchers
predict they eventually may be relegated to a role as gatekeepers
for the Web, packing and selling easy access to a greater wealth of
information than they ever could hope to assemble on their own.

INTERCHANGE PARTNERS PREPARE TO MOVE THEIR CONTENT TO WEB

      Once a captain announces he is abandoning ship, it's only
natural that his passengers won't be far behind.  So when AT&T New
Media Services announced it would move its AT&T Business Network
online service from its AT&T Interchange Online Network to the
World Wide Web, it was not surprising to learn that its "publishing
partners" are plotting similar moves.

     The Gartner Group Inc. unveiled plans last week - two days
prior to the AT&T announcement - to roll out a Web-based version of
its online service, @vantage, an online service offering analysis
and advice for information technology executives, by the second
quarter of this year.  Although Gartner said it has no plans to
abandon its presence on Interchange, at least while it exists, it
made clear that the future of the online world belongs to the Web.

     "While AT&T Interchange Online Network, the platform on which
@vantage was launched, is superior today, we expect the Internet to
become the pre-eminent platform from a functionality perspective,"
said Bruce Barlag, executive vice president of The Gartner Group's
Interactive Services.  "By the end of 1997, the Internet will be
the primary channel for the delivery of corporate information,
ranging from research reports to marketing literature," added Dave
Taylor, Garter's research area director for business operations.

Related Announcements Follow

     Another Interchange partner, The Star-Tribune Online, issued
a press release just hours after AT&T's announcement.  "The
Star-Tribune announced two weeks ago that it would develop a World
Wide Web version of Star-Tribune Online as a companion to the
Interchange version.  In response to AT&T's announcement, the
Star-Tribune will speed the development of its World Wide Web
edition."

     Star-Tribune said the first version of its Web edition will be
available in early February, while it maintains its presence on
Interchange.  When the Star-Tribune no longer is available on
Interchange, the Minneapolis-based service added, it will offer
members Internet access so they can connect to its new home on the
Web.

     While the Washington Post's Digital Ink service issued no
formal statement, vice president Fred Singer acknowledged that the
service is planning a shift to the Web as well.  Singer said the
Interchange announcement was not a surprise.

     "We see this as a natural evolution," he said, adding that
Digital Ink has been developing its Internet capabilities for
several months and will continue to publish on Interchange until
its Web-based service is ready.  Singer would not say when exactly
Digital Ink will be available on the Web, adding that an
announcement will be issued when the time arrives.

MUSCULAR ENTRANT INVADES INTERNET ACCESS MARKET 

      Whenever Internet executives gather to contemplate potential
new competitors, the discussion invariably dwells on the dreaded
Baby Bells, the seven local phone companies created when Uncle Sam
dismembered Ma Bell, a.k.a. AT&T Corp.

     However, what many often overlook is the fact that America's
largest local phone company is not Bell.  Gee.  No, GTE.  And the
$20 billion GTE Corp. just announced its intention to enter the
Internet access business with its new cyberarm, GTE.net.

     GTE's Intelligent Network Services (GTEINS) division will
begin offering GTE.net service to residential and business
customers in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area early this
year.  GTE.net, which will be rolled out to additional U.S. markets
throughout 1996, will offer World Wide Web access via Netscape
Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser, which GTEINS just
licensed.

More Than Just Internet Access

     GTE.net services will be available for $24.95 per month for
unlimited access, or $8.95 per month for five hours, with $1.95 for
each additional hour.  Business customers also can purchase
dedicated Internet access and a number of other options, including
Web site, firewall, electronic mail, encryption and transaction
processing services.  Access speeds will vary from 14.4 and 28.8 to
dedicated line speeds up to 45 megabits per second (Mbps) (T3) and
integrated services digital network (ISDN) lines at 128 kilobits
per second (Kbps).

     "Entering the Internet access business is the first step GTE
is taking to build a nationwide data network infrastructure that
will allow us to enter new markets and develop new products and
services," said Bill Wall, general manager of GTE.net.  "These new
services will include virtual private business networks, specific
business Internet applications focused on education, law
enforcement and government plus other market segments under
development.  Long term, we believe these services will become part
of a broader integrated service offering that includes voice, data
and video services."

     GTE is at (203) 965-2853.

MICROSOFT AND NBC UNVEIL MULTIMEDIA ALLIANCE 

      Microsoft Corp. and NBC deepened their corporate commitment
to one another last month, but fell short of exchanging vows, as
some had predicted.  The media and software giants announced the
formation of a joint venture to deliver news via broadcast, cable
and the Internet.  Microsoft and NBC each will commit approximately
$200 million over the next five years to fund the venture, which
includes a new online service, MSNBC Online.

     In addition, Microsoft will pony up an additional $220 million
for a 50 percent interest in NBC's "America's Talking" cable
network, which is being repurposed as a 24-hours-a-day news network
and renamed MSNBC Cable.

     The alliance is designed to leverage NBC's news gathering
operation, broadcast and cable television outlets, and brand-name
awareness with Microsoft's software expertise, online service and
"connection to the PC [personal computer] user."

     The three-pronged approach apparently is aimed at consumers
with plenty of time on their hands, since the partners clearly
expect viewers/subscribers to avail themselves of all three media
to stay informed.

     The companies intend for viewers to look to NBC News for
headlines from around the world, tune in to the cable channel for
in-depth analysis and click into the Microsoft Network (MSN) for
comprehensive information customized to the viewers' preferences.

     "We are excited by the opportunity to work together in global
commerce with the proven entrepreneurial capabilities of Microsoft,
the most exciting company of this decade," said Jack Welch, chief
executive officer of General Electric Co., NBC's corporate parent.

     "We will be working with NBC to create innovative interactive
news content and an integrated media experience," said Bill Gates,
chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft.  "Advances in
digital technology will give people new control over news and
information.  They will be able to watch breaking news on TV and
then be able to get more in-depth information on things of interest
to them online." 

All Things to All Media?

     NBC News, MSNBC Cable and MSNBC Online will work in unison,
share content and cross-promote one another in an attempt to become
the "leading source for news" in each of their respective media. 
The  MSNBC news services will be international in reach, due both
to the nature of the Internet and NBC's outright ownership or
partial interest in a number of broadcast and cable properties in
Europe, Asia and Latin America.

     MSNBC Cable will feature NBC News correspondents, live
coverage of world events and local coverage from NBC affiliates. 
MSNBC Online, which will be accessible through the MSN, will
repackage NBC and MSNBC content "to offer the ability to get a very
broad online view of news."  MSNBC Online also will be distributed
by cable operators when high-speed cable modems become available.

     "By linking the local, national and international 
newsgathering capability of NBC and its affiliates, as well as NBC
News archives, with Microsoft's technological leadership in
software development and commitment to Internet online services,
MSNBC will create a continuum of news delivery that meets viewer
needs at all levels," said Bob Wright, chief executive officer of
NBC.

     MSNBC Cable will be managed by NBC News, while MSNBC Online
will be jointly managed by NBC and Microsoft.  The partners,
however, took pains to emphasize the fact that NBC News will retain
"complete editorial control and integrity" of news content in
either service.

     So presumably, if the Justice Department forces Microsoft to
"unbundle" MSN from Windows 95, or if NBC News suffers another
"Dateline" scandal, viewers can turn on MSNBC Cable or log onto
MSNBC Online for all the unexpurgated, unburied and unwhitewashed
details.

BELLCORE HEADS TO THE WEB TO EXPAND NEW MEDIA REACH 

      After 18 months of searching for new opportunities to expand
its business beyond the Baby Bells, Bell Communications Research
Inc. (Bellcore) finally settled on the Internet as one ticket into
the new media market.  Leveraging its networking strength, Bellcore
is offering an in-house product line called Adapt/X, services and
third-party products to get companies into business on the World
Wide Web.

     Bellcore announced its Internet focus and new applications at
the December World Wide Web Consortium conference in Boston.  The
Adapt/X products include online publishing, transaction, back-end
infrastructure and security components, and Bellcore will offer
integration and support services with these products, although they
can be purchased as stand-alone applications.

     Bellcore also signed letters of intent with Sun Microsystems
Inc. and Netscape Communications Corp. to cooperate on software and
consulting services.  "We see a market window where we can put our
network knowledge to work," Ken Branson, Bellcore spokesman, said.

     These are the first of many alliances Bellcore hopes to make
with leaders in the Internet market to exchange technology and
establish reseller arrangements.  Aside from its Adapt/X line,
Bellcore wants to offer a wide range of products and services for
large corporations that wish to create commercial Web sites for
selling products and conducting business-to-business transactions
on the Web.

     As part of its arrangement with Sun, Bellcore will join the
company's Independent Software Vendor program to receive advance
information on new technologies such as Java.  Bellcore also may
act as a system integrator for Sun in the future.

     As part of its effort to go after high-end customers, Bellcore
partnered with marketing and advertising firm Adler Boschetto
Peebles & Partners to handle design and content-creation services. 
The firm's ABP Interactive unit will work with Bellcore to offer
package services to clients.

     Bellcore is at (201) 829-2165.

PRODIGY FACES SURPRISING SETBACK  

      Although Prodigy Services Co. believed it finally settled the
troubling Stratton Oakmont lawsuit last October, the presiding
judge had other ideas.

     In late December, New York Supreme Court Judge Stuart Ain
rejected an attempt by Prodigy to reargue his May decision that
found the online service liable as the publisher of defamatory
remarks directed at Stratton Oakmont, a New York brokerage firm,
posted on one of the Prodigy bulletin boards.

     The two parties were reconciled in October when Prodigy
expressed its regret at the remarks and Stratton Oakmont agreed to
drop its $200 million libel suit (IISR, Nov. 3, 1995, p. 3). 
Further, Stratton Oakmont agreed to not oppose Prodigy's effort to
reargue Ain's decision with additional evidence in an attempt to
convince the judge that it is not a publisher and thus not
responsible for the content of its bulletin boards.

Former Policy Created Problems

     Prodigy originally got itself into trouble over its
since-discarded but much-publicized policy of policing its bulletin
boards.  Although the online service did once employ staffers to
read every single piece of e-mail on its boards, that practice was
abandoned as unworkable in 1992 when the volume of mail began to
hit 60,000 to 75,000 messages a day.  It was this change of policy
(i.e., a conscious decision to not exercise complete editorial
control over its bulletin boards) that Prodigy hoped would change
Ain's mind.

     But in an unexpected turn of events, despite the fact Stratton
Oakmont dropped its suit, Ain rebuffed Prodigy's arguments.  "The
court finds that this is a developing area of the law, so that
there is a real need for a precedent," Ain said, according to a
Reuters report.

     If Ain's ruling stands, it may well set an expensive precedent
for the industry that could make the original $200 million suit
seem like chump change by comparison.  For online services may now
be held liable for every message posted by their subscribers, the
number of whom varies by service but can total in the millions.

     "The fact he views Prodigy as a publisher is a potentially
troubling precedent for the entire industry," said Bob Smith,
executive director of the Interactive Services Association.  "If
any commercial online operator is responsible for all content, even
if it has no control over it, then that's a huge problem."

     According to Brian Ek, Prodigy's vice president for government
affairs, the company has two options:  appeal Ain's decision or do
nothing.  And depending on what trans-pires in Congress on the
telecommunications reform bill, the latter may be the more
attractive option.

     Although "it's pretty clear there is not much point in going
back to this particular court," Ek said, Prodigy's luck might
change in appeals court.  For one thing, he said, the case involves
two parties that no longer are involved in litigation.  Further, Ek
asserted, Ain's denial had more to do with technicalities than the
validity of the new facts presented.

     "It is more of a procedural issue than anything," Ek said. 
"The judge admitted the facts were different, which certainly puts
us in a better position."

Waiting for Gingrich

     However, doing nothing may be the best course and, as far as
Prodigy's legal fees are concerned, the cheapest.  The "do nothing"
option is a gamble based on the final shape of telecommunications
reform legislation crawling through Congress.

     Ek said the legislation contains what he calls a "Stratton
Oakmont clause" that specifically removes liability for services
that make a good faith effort to apply rudimentary control over
content.

     "If this bill goes through, Stratton Oakmont will become a
footnote," Ek said, noting that such a law would pre-empt any state
legislation to the contrary.

     However, that's a big "if," especially given the fact that
telecommunications reform has taken a back seat to the budget
battle in recent weeks.  And time is a luxury Prodigy can ill
afford, since the clock is running on the opportunity to file an
appeal.  Ek said Prodigy probably will reach a decision within the
next week, adding that the rest of the industry hopes it will opt
to do nothing.

     "None of the other services are anxious for us to throw more
dollars at this one," Ek said.  "Everybody is looking at the
legislation going forward."

CompuServe SELF-CENSORS AFTER GERMAN OFFICIALS COMPLAIN 

      CompuServe Inc. continues scrambling to devise a
technological fix that will allow its almost 4 million non-German
members to regain access to more than 200 sexually explicit
Internet news groups.

     On Dec. 28, in response to an order by the government of
Germany, CompuServe suspended access through its service to the
controversial news groups, according to spokeswoman Daphne Kent. 
Bavarian law enforcement officials, Kent said, told the world's
second-largest online service that the content of the news groups
was illegal under German law.

     Since then, CompuServe officials and the public prosecutor's
office in Munich have traded denials in the media about who said
what.

Just Following Orders?

     Last week, authorities in Bavaria, Germany's most conservative
state, issued a statement claiming that they only had asked
CompuServe to "scrutinize" a list of potentially troublesome news
groups, and that it was the online service's decision alone to deny
access to the groups.  CompuServe maintains it was merely following
orders from Bavarian prosecutors who specified exactly which news
groups were illegal and therefore to be blocked.

     However, given the fact that under German law executives are
held personally responsible for the actions of their companies,
CompuServe may well be playing it safe in order to prevent its top
management from spending any time in a Bavarian cellblock.

     Complying with the German order forced CompuServe to deny its
entire worldwide customer base of more than 4 million users access
to the smut-based news groups, prompting an outcry among both
subscribers and the entire Internet community at large, which
accused the service of cybercensorship.

     CompuServe meanwhile is trying to devise a method of blocking
access to questionable content on a country-by-country basis, but
cannot say when such a solution will be ready.  Kent would not
speculate as to when, or even if, access would be restored, but
said the company is "always concerned" that blocking access to
information could cost the company customers.  Kent said no other
online service was similarly restricted and said "we were likely
targeted because of our size." 

No Other Service Targeted

     Although somewhat smaller than its chief competitor, America
Online Inc. (AOL), CompuServe has the greatest overseas presence of
any consumer online service.  In Germany it claims 100,000 members. 
The number is insignificant, however, in comparison to the more
than 1.8 million individuals who use the Internet in Germany and
whose access to the same news groups is harder to restrict,
depending upon their method of access.

     AOL, which recently launched a German online service with
German publisher Bertelsmann AG that relies heavily on
Internet-based content, has yet to encounter any similar
difficulties.  AOL spokeswoman Pam McGraw said the company is
investigating the CompuServe issue, but has yet to receive any
notification from the German authorities.

     "To the best of our knowledge, we have not received any
requests from the German government," she said.

     However, McGraw added, AOL offers users the ability to block
access to news groups, which may be its saving grace.  Although
CompuServe's Internet division offers Internet access software with
the ability to block access to adult content, the company's
flagship online service does not offer the same capability.

CAMELOT CORP. CUTS NORDIC INTERNET PHONE DEAL 

      Camelot Corp., a holding company whose subsidiary, Third
Plant Publishing, "publishes" DigiPhone, a software product that
allows users to place phone calls over the Internet, is trying to
establish a presence in what is arguably Europe's most
Internet-centric region, Scandinavia.

     Camelot has penned a deal with Copenhagen-based Telepartner
A/S to distribute its DigiPhone and DigiPhone Deluxe software
throughout Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

     In exchange for exclusive distribution rights, Telepartner has
agreed to pay Camelot $1 million in the form of 2.7 percent of its
share capital.  Camelot also secured the right to acquire a further
7.3 percent of Telepartner for approximately $2.7 million. 
Telepartner, which is valued at $37 million based on these
transactions, intends to offers its shares to the public on the
Copenhagen Stock Exchange by March 1997.  Should this proposed
initial public offering (IPO) fail to take place, Camelot has the
right to request that Telepartner buy back its 2.7 percent stake
for $1 million in cash.

     In addition, Camelot Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Danny Wettreich also was appointed a director of Telepartner, a
telephone database services firm with more than 500,000 companies
on file.  "Telepartner's marketing expertise in Scandinavia and its
access to corporate clientele will ensure a speedy market
penetration in this very important European region," Wettreich
said.

Other Camelot News

     In other Camelot-based news, the company reported growing
revenues for its quarter ended Oct. 31, even as losses increased
slightly.  Revenues rose to $527,144 from $350,479 one year ago,
while the company reported a loss of $798,693 for the quarter,
compared to $644,787 during the same period in 1994.  Camelot
attributed its results to start-up costs for its various divisions.

     Camelot's Third Planet Publishing began shipping DigiPhone
into retail stores, and expects to record larger sales in the next
quarter.  By the end of October, Camelot had opened five Mr. CD-ROM
Stores as part of its goal to launch 100 of the specialty retail
outlets by the end of 1996.  Camelot Distributing also is in the
building stages, as the company hired personnel and explored
relationships with retailers.

Will 1996 Turn Out to be the YEAR OF THE GHOST SITE? 

      Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates has been known to be
right on the money, and in his latest book, "The Road Ahead," his
analogy that compares the Internet and multimedia feeding frenzy to
the American gold rush may be a harbinger of things to come.

     Unfortunately, as a new study by International Data Corp.
(IDC) notes, after the gold ran dry in the 1800s, ghost towns were
left behind.  The research and consulting firm predicts that 1996
will be a "year of disappointment" for investors and corporations
in the online marketplace, reflecting sluggish development of a
significant consumer base.  In addition, 20 percent of the Fortune
500 companies that have commercial Web sites will close or stop
maintaining them, resulting in "ghost sites."

Lots of Interest, Not Much Content

     IDC also said the leading online information service providers
such as CompuServe Inc., America Online Inc., Prodigy Services Co.
and the Microsoft Network will realize more than 50 percent of
their revenues from offering access to the World Wide Web by the
middle of 1997, and that two of the four services will struggle for
survival.

     "Though we predict the overall growth in online subscribers
will continue to be very strong, we expect 1996 will show a high
turnover rate as users underwhelmed by the content on the Web
cancel their subscriptions and turn on their TVs," said Frank Gens,
senior vice president of research at IDC.  "Still, 1996 will be a
strategic investment year for businesses that expect to compete in
the growing electronic marketplace, because during the next five
years, the number of wired (i.e., online) users will rise to more
than 200 million, and by 2010, it will exceed 1 billion."

     Financial services companies, retailers and publishers will
bail out in the initial "hangover" period, Gens said, leaving the
door wide open for new leadership and the downfall of current
giants.  However, IDC predicts Microsoft will have a great 1996,
and its revenue will not be affected by potentially weaker holds on
the industry it may have with technology such as object linking and
embedding (OLE) and Visual Basic.

     Gens also forecasts that manufacturers of Internet appliances,
which allow users to access online information, will slash prices
in half by the end of 1996.  "The game console crowd is already
slicing away at the pricing for simple Web surfing devices," he
said.  "Within two years, Internet appliances will emerge as
giveaways - [from] less than $100 to free - by businesses that want
customers to access their online services."

GE TAKING INTERNET CONTRACT BIDS 

      Seeking to streamline its operations, General Electric Co.
launched the GE Trading Process Network (TPN) last week to let
suppliers bid for GE contracts over the Internet.  TPN primarily
will use electronic mail to solicit bids from outside contractors,
and GE hopes to conduct about $1 billion in transactions over the
network this year.

     This would quadruple the amount of online business-to-business
transactions GE already handles through a private electronic data
interchange (EDI) network run by subsidiary GE Information Services
(GEIS), which was roughly $250 million last year.

     GE will distribute the TPN software to suppliers that will be
able to receive information from the World Wide Web and submit bids
for projects through e-mail.  The GEIS unit has been promoting this
brand of electronic commerce for online trading between companies
as part of the International Business Exchange (IBEX) project,
officially launched last September with AT&T Corp., Dun &
Bradstreet Corp., the Global Business Alliance, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, Chase Manhattan Bank and other partners.

     IBEX is promoting an electronic mail-based service for
companies to solicit and bid on contracts online.  While GEIS is
involved in this effort, its parent company opted for a proprietary
solution instead of IBEX for handling its in-house suppliers.

PRODIGY TARGETS GENERATION X 

      Prodigy Services Co. apparently is trying to shed its image
as the leading family-based online service by broadening its appeal
to attract a more tragically hip audience.  Prodigy has acquired an
undisclosed interest in SonicNet, a Sunshine Interactive Network
division and producer of a World Wide Web site devoted to
alternative music and other cultural content for the nose-ring set.

     The move marks Prodigy's first investment in a Web-based
content provider, and was carried out under the aegis of its new
"Wildflower Partners" division, which, like America Online Inc.'s
"Greehouse" program, supports promising content providers with
money and distribution.  Under the agreement,  SonicNet will
provide Prodigy with original and exclusive content, including
celebrity chat sessions, marketing and a seamless link to
SonicNet's home page.  Prodigy will finance SonicNet's effort to
develop content, enlarge its staff and expand into new areas. 
SonicNet content includes chat areas with alternative rock
anti-heroes, the "Loser's Guide to New York" and links to "rockin'
sites on the Web."  

     In other Prodigy-based news, the service recently won the
Information Industry Association's Online Access 1995 HotShots

Just Bits

     Breaking News...

     ...  Sit tight and sell high.  Top executives at America
Online Inc. enriched themselves late last year with an insider
selling spree, unloading approximately 415,000 options after a
six-month lull, The Wall Street Journal reported.  According to
tracking firm CDA/Invest, AOL executives including Chairman Steve
Case (95,000 options), President of AOL Services Ted Leonsis
(40,000 options) and Chief Financial Officer Len Leader (40,000
options) cashed in their shares at prices from $38.45 to $40.13,
taking advantage of the 83 percent rise in AOL's share price since
the last round of insider selling six months ago.  Some analysts
speculated that the sell-off represented a hedge against the
not-too-distant future, when AOL and other online services will be
forced to compete with the World Wide Web rather than each other. 
Whether or not that's the case, they've certainly socked away
enough for a few rainy days.  You do the math....

     ...  More Web-based casualties?  Following the axing of
Interchange (see story, p. 3), other changes may be in store for
AT&T Corp.'s other online ventures.  Although a spokesman said no
alterations were planned for the company's Imagination Network, he
said AT&T and General Magic Inc. were investigating the feasibility
of transforming the proprietary Personal Link messaging service
into an Internet-based product....  Angry over the budget impasse? 
President Clinton, the nation's first cyber-savvy leader, has
received a death threat via the Internet, according to a Reuters
report.  An e-mail message originating from a university in
southern Taiwan reportedly said:  "President Clinton, when you are
out for a visit, we will assassinate you."  As if he didn't already
have enough problems here in Washington.

New & Noteworthy...

     ...  A kinder, gentler Internet?  The McKinley Group said it
intends to flag Web sites devoid of adult-based or X-rated content
though its Magellan Internet directory (http://www.mckinley.com). 
McKinley intends to place a "green light" icon in the listing of
Web sites it reviews as a sort of seal of approval to steer uses to
"safe sites."  If nothing else, McKinley's approach should help
Internet surfers in search of smut avoid wasting time in fruitless
sites....  Dow Jones & Co. Inc. and the New York Times Information
Services Group have reached a content-sharing agreement.  As of
Jan. 1, subscribers to the Dow Jones News/Retrieval online service
will be able to access full-text archives of The New York Times as
far back as 1981....  Microsoft Corp. and NBC (see story, p. 6) are
teaming to cash in on the Super Bowl advertising frenzy with a
World Wide Web site that will sell interactive ads and offer Super
Bowl-based content.  The only announced advertiser to date is, um,
Microsoft, but executives hoping to drum up interest from other
advertisers at a press conference said they expect the site will
generate "millions and millions" of hits.  Maybe during the
commercials?  Point your beer-soaked, salsa-stained mouse at
http://www.superbowl.com.

Over the Transom...

     ...  Germany, which has suffered more than its share of bad
press this century, has managed to alienate much of cyberspace as
well by ordering CompuServe Inc. to block access to questionable
news groups on the Internet (see story, p. 9).  And to add to the
Sturm und Drang, a San Francisco gay rights group said it has
called for a boycott of two German-brewed beers to protest the
Internet censorship.  The blocked discussion groups include topics
such as homosexuality and AIDS....  Need to know the relative troop
strength of Myanmar vis-a-vis Burkina Faso?  Check out the CIA's
World Factbook 1995, now available for the first time on CD-ROM. 
The Windows- and Macintosh-compatible CD-ROM boasts current
geographic, political, socioeconomic, cultural and military
information on more than 250 countries, and is available for $30 at

TEN THOUSAND DATA FILES FROM FEDWORLD

The FedWorld FTP site, a service of the Commerce Department's 
National Technical Information Service, may now be accessed through 
an easy-to-use intermediary Web site, located at 
"http://www.fedworld.gov/ftp.htm".
 
From here you can locate-through a search engine or browsing-more 
than 10,000 data files produced by federal government agencies.  A 
directory index is updated daily.
 
Especially valuable at this time of year, both for businesses and 
individuals, is the extensive collection of Internal Revenue Service 
forms and instructions.  Other extensive collections include those 
offered by the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of 
Commerce, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Office of Management and Budget, Treasury 
Department, and Securities Exchange Commission.  Other federal 
government agency offerings are also included.

SEARCH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MANUAL

Some researchers overlook the National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA), considering it a repository of historical 
rather than current information.
 
But tucked within NARA's Web site is a highly useful information 
resource, the 1995/96 edition of The United States Government Manual.  
You can reach it directly at 
"http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/nara001.html".
 
A built-in search engine lets you search for exact phrases.  You may 
also use "AND," "OR," and "NOT" for locating precisely the 
information you seek.
 
The Manual contains detailed descriptions and contact information for 
every federal government agency.

IT'S A ZOO OUT THERE

Spring hasn't quite sprung yet in many parts of the country.  But 
after surviving what for many has been a cabin-fever-filled winter, 
folks are itching to take advantage of the first Spring-like days.
 
A popular early Spring mini-outing is a trip to the zoo.  And you can 
get a taste of it and plan your itinerary via the World Wide Web.
 
A first stop could be the San Diego Zoo.  It's located at 
"http://www.sandiegozoo.org/", and its home page features 
descriptions and photos from many of its attractions.
 
Another western must is Portland, Oregon's Metro Washington Park Zoo.  
You'll find its photo gallery packed with pictures of some 50 
attractions.  Click on over to 
"http://www.caboose.com/a1topics/portland_zoo/".
 
Moving East, drop in at the Pittsburgh Zoo for an excellent section on 
wildlife and information on its "Kids Kingdom," especially designed for 
youth-and the young at heart, too.  It's at

CONGRESS TO CONSIDER CALLER ID BLOCKING BILL

A U.S. senator has proposed a bill that would require telephone companies to
offer subscribers the ability to block display of their telephone numbers to
subscribers of caller ID, one of the custom local area signaling services
(CLASS).

Sen. Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., said the Telephone Privacy Act of 1990 "balances
the privacy interests of callers and call recipients."  Hearings on the bill
are expected this spring before the Senate Subcommittee on Technology and the
Law, chaired by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.  Kohl is a member of that
subcommittee.

"The underlying principle of my bill is simple:  The caller should continue to
have a choice about whether to disclose the caller's own phone number and
address," Kohl told reporters last week.  He said a provision of the bill
would exempt caller ID blocking of originating numbers on calls to "911" or
other emergency services.

A freshman senator who a staffer said has a "personal interest" in
telecommunications technologies, Kohl expressed his views on caller ID
recently in a letter to the editor of the Washington Post and in an op-ed
piece in Newsday, the Long Island, N.Y., newspaper.

A spokesman for Bell Atlantic, which has introduced caller ID in New Jersey,
Maryland and Virginia, called the blocking requirement "inappropriate."  "The
service loses its value with blocking," he said.

But Kohl's bill was endorsed by Pennsylvania's Consumer Advocate, David
Barasch, who is leading the fight for caller ID blocking in an appeals court
challenge to a Bell of Pennsylvania tariff.  The tariff was approved by state
regulators in November and stayed by a state appeals court judge in late
December.  (See story on page 11)

The measure also won the support of Gary Leonard, chief of the Alexandria,
Va., Police Department, who said he represents an association of police chiefs
in northern Virginia.  While acknowledging the service's public safety
benefits, Leonard said caller ID impairs his police department's ability to
operate.

Leonard, whose suburban Washington, D.C., community has a pervasive problem
with illegal drug dealers, said he is aware of more than one undercover
operation that was "blown" because tipsters were afraid a telephone call would
reveal their identities.

Many police departments have programs that "work on the basis of anonymity,"
said Leonard, adding that caller ID is "a big turn-off to this kind of
support."  He said an offer by C&P Telephone of Virginia to make call blocking
available to the police would be counterproductive, since the special
treatment would tip off suspects with caller ID that the police are involved.

In other developments on the caller ID front, New York regulators in
mid-January ordered Rochester Telephone to offer per-call or subscription
blocking to caller ID as part of an upcoming three-month experimental trial of
custom local area signaling services (CLASS).

"Customer privacy is very important," Peter Bradford, chairman of the New York
State Public Service Commission, said in approving the trial with a per-call
or all-call blocking provision.  Callers in the 12,000 line exchange where
caller ID is being trialed may punch in one of two codes; one to block number
display on an individual call, and another to block display on all calls.

A Rochester Tel spokeswoman said the telco agreed to offer the two "privacy
options" after being urged to do so by state regulators.  "Our intention was
to be able to test this feature to the fullest," she said, adding that the
blocking requirement "certainly is going to impact the test results."

The spokewoman said Rochester Tel will evaluate the test before filing an
actual CLASS tariff later this year.

In a related development, Florida regulators on Jan. 30 ordered Southern Bell
to provide caller ID blocking on a limited basis to law enforcement and
domestic abuse agencies.  The BOC's CLASS tariff took effect Feb. 1.

PAC TEL SEEKS INTER-LATA MESSAGING WAIVER

Bidding to gain parity with existing messaging providers, Pacific Telesis has
requested a Consent Decree waiver allowing Pacific Bell to provide voice and
electronic messaging services between LATAs in California.

Pac Tel's "limited waiver request" would permit its BOC to select carriers to
handle messaging traffic among California's 10 LATAs and incorporate long
distance charges in bills issued to end users.

Pac Bell now offers voice messaging to business customers in the Sacramento,
San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego LATAs, and residential voice
messaging in Milpitas and San Pedro.  After customer-specific trials, the BOC
expects to roll  out electronic messaging in September.

"It is critical to the success of these new services that Pacific receive a
waiver of the decree to allow it to select interexchange carriers associated
with Pacific's provision of messaging services and to include the cost of
(long distance) services in Pacific's prices," Pac Tel said.

"Without this waiver, existing and potential customers of Pacific's messaging
services will soon determine that Pacific's services are not easily accessible
and usable," the Bell regional holding company (RHC) said.

Pac Tel said the decree "may be interpreted as imposing two practical
obstacles to providing efficient service": 1) equal access provisions require
customers to select carriers for long distance communications, and 2) the long
distance carrier is permitted to bill its customers directly and separately.

"Without relief from these requirements, a user outside his or her home LATA
trying to retrieve or deposit voice messages will incur costly per-minute long
distance charges," the RHC said.  "And users trying to retrieve or deposit
electronic messages from outside their LATA must learn a nine-step set of
procedures that will be very difficult for most consumers to master."

Pac Tel's filing expresses particular concern that the decree's
carrier-selection and billing requirements may impose higher costs on users of
its messaging services than on users of competing services.


No One-Number Solution


The RHC notes that many voice messaging providers allow their customers to
avoid long distance charges by offering access to messaging systems through a
single "800" number.      "However, since the decree may be read to prohibit
Pacific from selecting a single (carrier) to provide 800-number interexchange
access, without a waiver Pacific will have to connect its messaging equipment
with all (carrier) 800-number providers that Pacific's customers may select,"
the RHC said.

While an equitable solution, the use of multiple long distance carriers would
boost Pac Tel's costs by requiring development of new billing software and
procedures, as well as the purchase of enough messaging equipment to
interconnect all possible 800 providers, the RHC said.

"These incremental costs, when added to the prices for Pacific's messaging
services, can be expected to severely dampen customer demand," Pac Tel said.
For instance, the RHC said, a two-minute inter-LATA call to Pac Bell's voice
messaging service would cost 50 percent more than a similar call to "two major
providers."

Addressing electronic messaging, Pac Tel said students at Santa Clara
University normally used a five-step procedure to gain access to Pac Bell's
electronic messaging service in the San Francisco LATA, but had to go through
nine steps to send or receive messages from outside the LATA.

"Experienced computer users with sophisticated portable personal computers may
not be daunted by the complications (carrier) selection poses for use of
Pacific's electronic messaging services," the RHC said. "However, the average
consumer will find it difficult to deal with these complications."

Pac Tel went on to explain how carrier selection would increase the company's
costs when electronic messages are forwarded from one LATA to another, and how
additional costs are incurred in the usage of voice or electronic
store-and-forward technology.

Blocking Not Feasible


Simply blocking subscriber access to long distance messaging would avoid the
problems raised by carrier selection, the RHC said, "but it would also block
the potential for success and widespread public adoption of Pacific's
messaging services."  Pac Tel estimates that 13 percent to 14 percent of its
customers' messaging would cross LATA boundaries.

"These boundaries should not arbitrarily and unnecessarily affect and distort
the evolution of competition in the market for messaging services," the
company said.

"Denial of Pacific's request may not kill these services," the RHC said in
conclusion.  "However, it will result in higher-priced, less-functional,
less-convenient messaging services that fail to adequately serve the customers
the court hoped would benefit from these new services."

ALABAMA APPROVES LIMITED TRIAL OF TWO-WAY LMS

The Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC) has allowed South Central Bell to
offer an experimental two-way measured service tied to certain network calling
features used by enhanced service providers (ESP) such as telephone answering
services.

Florida regulators approved a similar tariff filed by Southern Bell in
November 1988 (ESO December 1988).

The Alabama decision (docket 21071) came in response to the BOC's petition to
introduce two-way measured service as a condition for subscribing to five
unbundled basic service elements (BSE).  An ESP wanting to purchase one or
more of the BSEs would be required to purchase a two-way measured local access
line that measured incoming calls as well as outgoing calls.

South Central Bell initially will offer the services in the Huntsville, Ala.,
area with expansion to other Alabama communities as demand develops.

The BSEs provide specialized forwarding, message relaying and
call-transferring capabilities for voice messaging providers.  The PSC noted
that South Central Bell and ESPs were at odds over the need for tying the BSEs
to two-way measured service.

South Central Bell contend that without two-way measured service, the advent
of new voice messaging services will cause increased usage over its local
network and create costs that won't be recovered through the rates paid by the
ESPs.

The ESPs, supported by MCI,  claimed the opposite.  They said two-way measured
service will increase their network access costs by 100 percent to 800
percent, killing off many providers.  They also said the two-way measured
service is unnecessary because voice messaging will make the local network
more efficient, because a far higher proportion of calls will be completed on
the first attempt and average holding times will be reduced.

Smaller ESPs said volume discounts in the proposed two-way measured tariffs
give South Central Bell's own voice messaging services an advantage over the
services of non-affiliated providers, and give other large voice messaging
companies an advantage over all the small fry.

The PSC concluded that neither side produced sufficient evidence to prove
their claims.

Regulators also noted that a number of state-federal jurisdictional issues
remain unresolved in the FCC's open network architecture (ONA) proceeding on
the BOCs' obligations to provide equality of access for all affiliated and
non-affiliated ESPs. The final decisions on these issues, the PSC said, could
have an impact on the South Central Bell's proposal.

While the BSEs South Central Bell proposes might be beneficial for ESPs, they
are optional.  Voice messaging companies, the PSC said, can continue to use
their present access arrangements if they do not want to pay the bidirectional
measured rates.

The regulators concluded that, given the jurisdictional uncertainties about
ONA and the total divergence of views on the tariff, a market trial is the
only sensible course.

The one-year trial will be limited to exchanges in the Huntsville area and
will run until mid-January 1991; the rates proposed in the BOC's filing  will
be the rates for the trial.  The PSC said it "is hopeful that the trial will
provide data to help both the company and this commission determine the proper
tariff treatment of services that support the provision of enhanced services."

PRODIGY: POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS MAY IMPEDE SUCCESS

After spending untold hundreds of millions of dollars to get their Prodigy
videotex venture off the ground, IBM and Sears can expect to see operating
profits from Prodigy within a few years and their investment paid off by the
late 1990s, company officials told reporters at a Washington, D.C., briefing.

Membership and usage levels have surpassed Prodigy's initial expectations,
with 200,000 members out of a potential universe of 8 million to 10 million
households equipped with personal computers having 512 kilobytes of memory.

Prodigy projects that its computer universe will exceed 35 million homes by
1996, making its $9.95 a month (or $89.95 a year) service a huge hit with a
baby boomer generation too busy to get out of the house.

Membership fees are just the tip of their revenue base, officials say, noting
that "the lion's share" of their money will be made from transaction and
advertising fees provided by over 200 advertisers, merchandisers and direct
marketers. Prodigy is currently running over more than 750 different programs
on its menu.

Sales of Prodigy kits, many outfitted with 1200-or 2400-baud modems, also is a
substantial, albeit short-term, source of revenue.  The kits have become the
top item in most computer software stores, retailers report.

Company officials are recommending the 2400-baud modem for better graphics and
reasonable program speeds, but continue to offer a  sizeable number of
1200-baud modem kits still in retail stores.

Prodigy's blue sky projections as a profitable, state-of-the-art service may
be threatened by the FCC's open network architecture plan, officials say.
Even more daunting to Prodigy, these officials said, are telco ambitions to
force enhanced service providers (ESP) to pay measured rates for both incoming
and outgoing calls, the officials added.

"From our perspective, there's a fundamental problem with ONA," said Sandra G.
Weis, Prodigy's director of government affairs.  "It doesn't pave the way to
equal access, or even try to approximate equal access.  Instead of achieving
modularity, the FCC has chosen a model that continues the bottleneck."

Safeguards For Equal Access


That's a big problem for Prodigy, Weis says, because Prodigy wants to serve
customers over an ever-more-powerful, transparent network.  "We need
safeguards that would relieve the bottleneck over time, with approximate
here-and-now equal access," she says.  "We need to prevent cross-subsidies,
and protect against discrimination."

Although  many ESPs have focused on co-location of their equipment in telco
central offices,  Weis thinks such an emphasis is at least partly misguided.
"Co-location is just one tool to approximate equal access," she says.  "We are
going to need stronger safeguards."

While ONA is of prime concern to Prodigy, a bigger threat to Prodigy's success
is perceived to be inherent in telco pricing, particularly exemplified by
Southern Bell's bi-directional message rates approved in Florida and Alabama,
and pending in Georgia.

"It's a fundamental tension between ESPs and telcos," acknowledges Allison
Lash, Prodigy's program manager for state government affairs. Noting that
Prodigy's flat fee is largely based on customers using their computer's
intelligence to complete transactions rather than a Prodigy mainframe, Lash
says the Southern Bell proposals would probably sink the pricing concept,
while impeding a network evolution to higher transmission speeds.

Higher transmission speeds are a key part of Prodigy's game plan. According to
Sirajul Islam, Prodigy's manager of communications technology, the company
hopes to transmit at 9600 kilobits per second, a speed that would allow higher
quality graphics and sound.  With such features, Prodigy could become "like a
radio that would be left on all day," he says.

"Affordable pricing is a key goal," says Weis.  "Right now, our average  line
costs $35.  But the proposal by Southern Bell would cost about $200 for the
same service.  We recognize that Southern Bell wants to solve its problem with
voice technologies.  But we can see this as being used for new technologies.

"The telco doesn't just want to  move in an evolutionary pattern," she adds.
"We feel it wants to break out of the gate."

"The company has to spend tremendous resources worrying about access charges,"
adds Islam.

But a Southern Bell spokesman doubts that the company's tariff would ever be
applied to anything but voice messaging.  "It's not necessary.  We don't
foresee that," he said when asked about the bi-directional measured rate being
applied to data services.

The spokesman said Prodigy's main concern appears to be Southern Bell's
transition to measured service in certain areas.  Prodigy denies that, saying
"measured service was not a problem per se."

Even while telcos are the source of Prodigy's greatest worries, they are also
the source of Prodigy's greatest hopes.  The company is hoping that recent
deals with Rochester Telephone and Nynex to provide transmission and
maintenance facilities (and marketing in the Rochester Tel deal) will convince
other telcos to help spread the service faster, and also to save money.

"Since the Nynex agreement, we've had additional contacts with other telephone
companies," said Islam, who declined to elaborate.  He dismissed Nynex's
concern that it might be limited in the degree of marketing activities it
could do for Prodigy.

"Everything that Rochester is doing a Bell operating company could do," he
said.

U S WEST ANSWERS CRITICS OF ELECTRONIC WHITE PAGES WAIVER

U S West has answered critics of its request for a Consent Decree
clarification or waiver to offer on-line directory assistance information as
an "exchange access" service throughout its 14-state region.

U S West sought the clarification last month in response to a request from an
unnamed long distance carrier.   Since then, AT&T, which supported U S West's
efforts, filed a tariff to provide electronic directory assistance service
starting Jan. 18.

Information available through U S West's electronic white pages, including the
subscriber's name, address, telephone number, ZIP and area codes, would be
"obtained and updated daily from the same databases the company's BOCs use to
provide directory assistance, U S West said.

To CompuServe's objection that the database includes ZIP codes and permits
address and telephone number searches, U S West replied that Judge Harold
Greene already has approved the company's waiver to provide subscriber
information when the caller provides either the address or telephone number.

"The only question raised by U S West's (electronic white pages) request is
whether the same information, using the same search categories, can be
divulged by a U S West computer rather than by a U S West operator (using a
computer)," the company said (emphasis in original).

As for CompuServe's objection to the inclusion of ZIP codes, U S West
questions "why ZIP code information, an integral part of a person's address,
should not be included with a person's address."

U S West dismissed Dun & Bradstreet's contention that delivery of formatted
directory assistance data requires a waiver as "mistaken."  The company said
formatting "is a function U S West must perform" to provide electronic white
pages, and one that may be required by the decree.

To ADAPSO and CompuServe's point that electronic white pages is an information
service, U S West answers that it may be one or the other.  "If the caller
uses the directory information to make a call, the service is a
telecommunications service; if the caller uses the information for other
purposes (e.g., to verify an address), the service is an information service."

Finally, Dun & Bradstreet's concern that provision of electronic white pages
"not cross the line" to electronic yellow pages is misplaced, U S West said.
"U S West's (electronic white pages) service will involve only directory
information ... classified advertising and other information will not be
available," the company said.

AT&T UNVEILS 'VOICEMARK' NATIONAL MESSAGE DELIVERY SERVICE

Beating its long distance competitors to the Touch-Tone punch, AT&T has raised
the veil on the first nationwide public voice messaging service.

VoiceMark, which for now is being marketed only in the Southeast, gives anyone
with a telephone and a Visa, MasterCard or AT&T charge card the ability to
send a recorded message to a direct-dialed number across the city or around
the world.

Callers to a toll-free number follow step-by-step instructions to record and
send a one-minute personal message.  The message can be delivered
automatically to any telephone number or person-to-person, with an attendant
introducing the recording.

AT&T charges $1.75 for automatic message delivery or $2.50 for
person-to-person service, including toll  charges.  Callers do not have to
subscribe to the service or buy any special equipment.

In fact, AT&T clearly expects most VoiceMark users to be "impulse" buyers:
people whose tight schedules and urgent need to exchange information requires
that they convey messages quickly and conveniently.

"You no longer have to endure the frustration and time delays associated with
a telephone that's busy, friends and associates who aren't home, or time-zone
differences," said Karen Antonucci, AT&T's marketing manager for VoiceMark.

However, users of the service do have to endure a complicated eight-step
procedure lasting at least two minutes in order to send a one-minute message.
(For sophisticated users, AT&T provides the option of skipping over
instructional messages by pressing the "#" sign.)

A VoiceMark call to the toll-free number (800 562-MARK) is greeted by an
automated female voice, which instructs the caller to dial a code (*H) to
obtain information on pricing and conditions.  The same code also summons an
attendant.

The user then is instructed to enter a Visa, MasterCard or AT&T card number.
After a pause, the VoiceMark system requests the card's expiration date,
explaining that a January 1990 date should be entered "190."

After verifying the billing information, VoiceMark inquires whether the caller
wants to humanize the message's introduction by recording the caller's name,
or leave the message anonymous.  If the caller wants his name included in the
message, the system replays the name and asks whether the caller would like to
re-record it.

VoiceMark then asks for the area code and number of the recipient, then
repeats it for verification. The system asks whether the caller would like a
reply message, and whether the caller's message should be delivered
automatically or person-to-person.  The caller then is prompted to record the
message after a "beep."

If the caller selects automatic delivery, the VoiceMark system will dial the
intended recipient repeatedly over the next two hours, an AT&T spokesman said.
Algorithms designed by AT&T Bell Labs and built into the  equipment will cause
VoiceMark to dial more frequently if the number is busy than if there is no
answer, he said.

The caller also can designate a delivery day and time, and whether VoiceMark
should continue delivery attempts for one, two, three or four hours, the
spokesman said.  If the caller selects person-to-person delivery, an attendant
will personally introduce the message to the recipient specified.

One flaw revealed during a test of VoiceMark by Enhanced Services Outlook was
that at no time did the automated system explain how a user was to retrieve a
reply message.  A VoiceMark attendant told a reporter he would have to dial
the "800" number, enter his credit card number and request information on the
status of previous messages.

The AT&T spokesman said VoiceMark was subjected to numerous "customer trials"
before its rollout in Atlanta.  "We feel like what we've got out there is what
we want," he said.

During the initial marketing period, only AT&T customers associated with
BellSouth's BOCs, Southern Bell and South Central Bell, are permitted to
charge their calls to their AT&T telephone calling card, according to a
VoiceMark attendant.  There are no geographic restrictions for callers wishing
to charge the service to their Visa or MasterCard numbers.

The spokesman declined "for competitive reasons" to say when AT&T might market
the service nationally.

CONSUMER GROUPS COUNTER RHC CLAIMS ABOUT INFORMATION SERVICES

Challenging claims that the Bell regional holding companies (RHC) must be
freed to "jump-start" the Information Age, two powerful consumer organizations
say ratepayers would pay a heavy price for RHC participation in a
"centralized" information services infrastructure.


The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and the American Association of
Retired Persons (AARP) say information services are developing rapidly and
should continue to grow as more the personal computer (PC) becomes a common
residential appliance.


"Lifting (Consent Decree or telco/cable cross-ownership) barriers on local
telcos ... would not provide any significant new services," Gene Kimmelman,
CFA's legislative director, told reporters last week in Washington, D.C.

But permitting the telcos to develop a fiber-optic-based network -- including
fiber to the home -- in order to deliver video services will cost ratepayers
at least $250 billion, or $5 a month per subscriber more on average over the
next 33 years, according to a CFA/AARP study. The report, called "Expanding
the Information Age for the 1990s: A Pragmatic Consumer Analysis," was
prepared by Mark Cooper of the Citizens Research public interest group.

The report criticizes the centralized, single-wire system based on
fiber-optics often suggested by the RHCs as the ideal infrastructure for
delivering voice, data and video information.  Such a system would concentrate
computing power within the network and allow users to access information
through low-cost terminals, similar to Frances Minitel.

"We don't think the Information Age is broke," said Kimmelman.  "If it were
broke, centralizing wouldn't fix it."

Southwestern Bell and U S West already have adopted such a strategy in their
deployment of videotex gateway terminals in Houston and Omaha, Neb.,
respectively.

The CFA/AARP report favors a "decentralized" system with more than one network
delivering information services to the home.

"With the price of (PCs) falling, consumer demand growing and computer
literacy increasing, U.S. investment in centralized network-based intelligence
and dumb terminals would be a costly waste of resources," the study concludes.

In either a centralized or decentralized environment, low-income, rural and
non-profit groups will not be able to afford information services without
programs designed to subsidize the costs, according to CFA.

The CFA/AARP study was quickly criticized by BellSouth and the Alliance for
Public Technology (APT), a non-profit group "concerned with making
communication and information services more affordable and available to the
public."

BellSouth criticized the study as containing "a number of blatant
misstatements.  It is just plain wrong to suggest that the information
services now enjoyed by countries such as France also are available in the
United States.  It is inaccurate to claim that installing fiber optics -- a
process BellSouth began before 1980 -- will drive up local phone bills."

APT said the "so-called study" by CFA and AARP "condemns 60 percent of the
consumers who they recognize will not have PCs by the end of the century to
second-class status in the new information age....

"Such an approach is anything but pragmatic," APT said.  "It is inherently
elitist and will exclude most consumers from the benefits of the information
age."

PENNSYLVANIA COURT TO REVIEW BELL OF PA.'s CALLER ID TARIFF

A Pennsylvania judge has issued a partial stay of Bell of Pennsylvania's
caller ID tariff, saying legal and public policy issues raised by the state
Consumer Advocate and other groups require resolution before the service
becomes available.

In postponing the Jan. 9 effective  date of the BOC's tariff, Commonwealth
Court Judge James Crumlish Jr. said petitioners had made a "substantial
showing" that caller ID falls within the state Wiretap Act's definition of a
"trap and trace device."

Crumlish added that petitioners had met the legal burden of showing caller ID
may cause "irreparable injury" without the stay, and that the stay will not
adversely affect the public interest.  The partial stay permits Bell of Pa. to
offer caller ID to "emergency service providers."

Oral arguments in the case are set for Feb. 7.  In a brief filed with the
court, however, Bell of Pa. countered that the appeal would "create a new
legal right to make anonymous phone calls."

BOC: Reject Claims


"The (petitioners') claims under the Pennsylvania Wiretap Act should be
rejected because they are contrary to the plain language of the statute and
the opinion of the Attorney General. ...  All that the act requires to
provider caller ID service is the consent of the called party who purchases
the service."

Caller ID permits the called party to view the caller's originating telephone
number on a display unit before answering the phone.  Opponents of the service
in Pennsylvania say it is illegal, or not in the public interest, for Bell of
Pa. to offer caller ID without giving callers the option of blocking display
of their numbers by punching a code before dialing a call.

An administrative law judge (ALJ) at the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission (PUC) in September recommended caller ID with per-call blocking,
saying the service appears to violate the Wiretap Act's prohibition on
recording telephone numbers without the consent of both the calling and called
parties.

On a 3-1 vote, the PUC approved caller ID in November, but withheld the
general availability of per-call blocking.  State regulators ordered Bell of
Pa. to make blocking available to law enforcement authorities and
domestic-violence agencies, as well as individuals associated with such
agencies who are certified by authorities.

In approving the partial stay, Crumlish said the petitioners "have made a
substantial showing that caller ID service falls within the Wiretap Act's
definition of a 'trap and trace device.'"  An exception in the law does permit
recording of "electronic communication" but, as Crumlish notes, "that
exception specifically limits this privilege to a 'provider of electronic or
wire communication service.'"

Crumlish further notes that "irreparable harm" may result to such individuals.
"The record is entirely devoid of evidence suggesting the most minimal
guidelines, such as who might qualify for certification and how much time
would be necessary to effect certification," he said.

"Moreover, the commission's order failes to set forth basic provisions of
notice, hearing and appeal," Crumlish said.  "Thus, individuals who are to be
protected must rely on the unfettered discretion of law enforcement officials
in order to obtain protections that the commission acknowledges are
necessary."

Arguments 'Persuasive'


Although his opinion addresses the stay alone, the judge's view of caller ID
closely parallels that of the ALJ.  Crumlish said he "finds persuasive" the
ALJ's opinion that "other Bell services currently available on a per-call
basis -- such as Call*Trace, Call*Block or Call*Return (Bell Atlantic's
service marks) -- used in conjunction with local Message Unit Detailed
Billing, offer harassed customers essentially the same ability to remedy
abusive calls.

"Thus, because the pervasive nature of the intrusion here -- the dissemination
of one's telephone number without his consent to the general public -- is out
of proportion to the marginal benefits caller ID provides, this (judge) finds
that applicants' request presents no harm to the public interest," Crumlish
said.

Led by Consumer Advocate David Barasch, these groups argue that the general
availability of unrestricted caller ID would violate Pennsylvania's
anti-wiretap law and state constitution, as well as harm the public interest.

The availability of a blocking option and the caller's decision not to punch
in the blocking code would amount to "consent," according to the petitioners
-- Barasch, the American

Civil Liberties Union, the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence
and the Consumer Education and Protective Association.

A Bell of Pa. spokesman said the BOC is "confident" the Commonwealth Court
will permit the introduction of caller ID without the blocking feature.  "The
justice system works, and after it's over we're going to offer caller ID," the
spokesman said.

U S WEST TESTS OCTEL's MADE-FOR-TELCO VOICE MESSAGING SYSTEM

About 500 employees at U S West's Advanced Technology Center in Englewood,
Colo., are trying out a voice-message system said to be the first expressly
designed to allow local telcos to serve residences and small businesses.

Previous and competing products are designed for private use on customers'
premises or by answering services, according to the manufacturer, Octel
Communications of Milpitas, Calif.

Octel is one of four vendors of voice messaging technology now being used in
trials and commercial applications by BOCs around the country. U S West and
BellSouth have chosen the company for their commercial products.

Southwestern Bell and Bell Atlantic have chosen Boston Technology as their
primary vendor of voice messaging products.  Nynex is using equipment produced
by Centrigram, in addition to Octel gear, in its voice messaging rollout in
Boston.  Pacific Telesis is using Octel in its residential applications, but
Digital Sound equipment for business offerings.

Octel's Sierra system ultimately will be able to accommodate 2,304 ports and
serve half a million customers, Octel says.  An interim version with 72 ports
will be ready for delivery to the general market in April, and a 144-port
model will be produced in the third quarter of 1990,  said Dan Patyk, Octel's
general manager of telephone company business development.

The product's chief attractions are low initial cost, allowing telcos to test
the service before investing heavily; simplified voice prompts, and rugged
design suited to telco central offices, Patyk said.

He noted that voice mail systems made for businesses offer a variety of
features such as listening to the message before it's sent, confirmation that
it has been sent and marking for delivery only to the person to whom it is
addressed.

By comparison, although the Sierra can add features, its initial offerings
have been kept deliberately simple.  And customers can dial help lines if they
have trouble.

U S West has tested other Octel systems in Denver, Phoenix, Omaha, and Boise,
Idaho.  The Bell regional holding company (RHC) received a comparably
efficient interconnection waiver for those trials in December 1988.

As one example of custom design for telco use, Patyk noted that the many disk
drives used to store information in the Sierra are modular.  When one develops
faults --  as all disk drives eventually do -- a technician simply pulls out
the old drive and inserts a new one.

Sierra adheres "to the Bellcore Network Equipment-Building Systems
guidelines," said Robert Cohn, Octel president and chief executive officer.
In addition, the hardware can be monitored remotely from a central
network-management center.

One secret to Sierra's capacity is the inclusion of up to 18 Intel 80386
computer processing chips in each 144-port unit.  Another is the capacity to
link modules with a 100 megabits-per-second fiber-optic link. In addition, the
2,304-port version will be able to store 10,750 hours of messages, the maker
claims.

Components, including line cards and telephone interface cards, can be
replaced without shutting down power to the system, Octel said.

The equipment works with both analog and digital trunks, and can service as
many as 144 central offices, Octel said.

Prices start at $370,000 for the 72-port model.  The base price of the
144-port version is $545,000.

BELL ATLANTIC REQUESTS MASSIVE PROTOCOL-CONVERSION WAIVER

Bell Atlantic has asked the Justice Department for a Consent Decree waiver
that would allow it to offer computer protocol conversion independent of its
videotex gateway.  Buyers could choose the service they need for private
networks.

"Bell Atlantic does not concede that the conversions at issue here are
information services," the Bell regional holding company (RHC) said. "Bell
Atlantic believes that all these conversions are already permitted because
they simply allow a wide variety of terminals and computer systems to
communicate with each other over the telephone network.

"As such, they are used 'for the management, control or operation of a
telecommunications system ... or service' and are, therefore explicitly
excluded from the decree's definition of information services," the RHC said.

Specifically, the RHC wants the waiver to allow it to convert electronic mail
messages into printed form.  "For example, such a conversion could allow an
asynchronous terminal in a store that sells lottery tickets to communicate
efficiently with the central computer that runs the lottery system," Bell
Atlantic said.

In all, the RHC wants to convert messages among 17 different data transmission
formats:  1) asynchronous protocols used by personal computers and many other
office devices, 2) X.25  packet switching, the basis of Bell Atlantic's Public
Data Network, 3) X.75, which permits communication between two packet switched
networks, 4) high-level data link control, allowing synchronous data
transmission over point-to-point, multi-point, switched or unswitched
facilities, 5) IBM 3270 binary synchronous protocol, between IBM computers and
IBM terminal cluster controllers, 6) IBM System Network Architecture/
Synchronous Data Link Control, which would allow communication between IBM
computers in multiple remote locations, 7) IBM 2780/3780, an old synchronous
protocol used for batch communications, 8) Burroughs Data Link Control, the
Burroughs version of number 4, above, 9) Digital Equipment Corp.'s Data
Communications protocol, 10) Sperry Universal Data Link Control, the same as
4, 8, and 9, 11) X.400 electronic mail, the international standard for
electronic mail, 12) transmission control protocol/ internet protocol, 13)
Ethernet, a popular variety of local area network protocol, 14) token ring,
also a LAN protocol, 15) dual-queue, dual-bus, metropolitan area network,  16)
Fiber Distributed Data Interface, a 100 megabits-per-second, fiber optic,
token-ring LAN, and 17) electronic mail to fax hard copy.

Comments are to be directed to the Justice Department by Feb. 7.

Pac Bell Drops Voice Mail Prices

Pacific Bell says tests of residential voice messaging services in two
California cities have been rousing successes, but have convinced the company
to lower service prices.

"More than 95 percent of our trial customers have been very happy with the
Pacific Bell Message Center," said Kris Kenworthy, Pac Bell product manager.
But customers said the price is too high: $7.50 a month in Milpitas, near San
Jose, and $6 a month in San Pedro, near Los Angeles.


Pac Bell set the price of voice messaging at $4.95 a month.

The company has been testing  residential voice mail service since March.  It
received approval of its comparably efficient interconnection plan from the
FCC in February 1989. Pac Bell says it will offer the service in San
Francisco, San Jose and other Bay-area towns by the end of the year.

BellSouth To Sell Voice Mail Gear

BellSouth has renewed for two years its existing contract to sell a full range
of voice processing equipment made by Digital Sound Corp. of Santa Barbara,
Calif., the two companies announced recently.

BellSouth's two BOCs, Southern Bell and South Central Bell has been selling
Digital Sound's equipment since 1986.  "The VoiceServer product line is now
serving many BellSouth customers and we expect significant expansion of this
base over the next two years," said Robert Kelly, Digital Sound's senior vice
president of sales.

Digital Sound's product line includes voice mail, automated attendant, voice
bulletin board and interactive voice response products for businesses.

Ameritech Expands VoiceQuest

Ameritech Audiotex Services will add audiotex processing facilities using its
VoiceQuest system in Milwaukee, Indianapolis and Detroit by mid-April, the
company announced recently.  The company already operates a Chicago gateway.

The unregulated Ameritech subsidiary will process calls to sponsor-paid "800"
numbers and caller-paid intra-LATA "900" numbers.  The company had been
awaiting approval of intra-LATA 900 tariffs before starting up the "specialty
gateways," according to an Audiotex Services spokeswoman.

In a related development, Audiotex Services is promoting its Chicago "976"
audiotex service by offering information providers who sign up by April 1 a
1-ounce gold coin and waiving the monthly minimum usage charge for six months.

Common Carrier Rules Approved

The New York Public Service Commission has approved a set of generic rules
defining the obligations of telephone companies and other common carriers.

The new rules require telcos to provide their publicly offered voice and data
transmission services on demand and on similar terms to similarly situated
customers.  The rules require that telephone companies must provide
interconnections for other private and public networks.

On the subject of video transmission, the rules provide that if telcos begin
to offer common carrier video services, the telcos must have enough capacity
available for any video content provider who wants to buy video transmission
service.  The rules also require that the telcos treat all video content
providers equally.

The rules require that the component functions and elements making up a
transmission service be "segregable" to the fullest practical extent.

The rules declare that telecommunications common carriers have no control over
the content of lawful communications and cannot impose unreasonable
restrictions on network use solely because of content.  In return, the rules
absolve telecom common carriers from any legal liability for damages caused by
the content of messages they carry.

But when carriers learn of content controversies, they are obligated to inform
the content providers and complaining parties about the appropriate complaint
mechanisms.

Where laws require restrictions because of message content, the law is to be
administered by carriers in the least restrictive manner the law allows.  The
rules require that end-users be given the capability to block services when
they find the content to be objectionable, unless such blocking is technically
impossible or prohibitively expensive.

The decision to adopt these rules was not unanimous.  Commissioner Gail
Schwartz, in a dissenting opinion, said the rules were too vague to be of
value and offered the potential for conflict with other proceedings such as
the commission's ongoing activity on open network architecture.

Letters: Surf's Down


In response to your request for predictions of what will be
hot in '96, I offer the following: The Internet hasn't peaked
yet, but you can almost hear the sound of the firewalls slamming
shut as companies find out that surfing is about as productive
inside a company as it is on the beach.

Big corporations will abandon the Net in droves as they figure
out the economic benefits of creating a non-public, more secure
backbone of their own.

Watch for some big players to figure this out early. Also, CompuServe
and Prodigy will merge. Or will Delphi buy one or both?

Letters: Intelligent Choice


I see interest in topics traditionally associated with artificial
intelligence experiencing a resurgence in 1996 as people try
to get more value out of their data warehouses. The urge to
experiment with data mining will be the primary spark behind
this resurgence.

However, more people will experiment with agents, case-based
reasoning, fuzzy math, genetic algorithms, and neural networks
as they try to better understand what they have stored in their
warehouses.

Rather than one or two products benefiting from this increased
interest, a variety of technologies will see a modest upswing
in sales.

Letters: Development Made Easy



In 1996, I see applicational development in HTML taking off,
removing one of the biggest problems that all businesses have
in developing for hybrid networks.

Products such as Next's Web-Objects will sell tremendously as
corporations realize that age-old problems like remote administration
and remote software distribution are no longer needed on such
a scale, as only servers need to be updated. Also, finished
apps will be viewed by management or any person interested
in the product by simply installing Netscape.

do so.

Editor's Note: Prognostications -- Looking Ahead

By:
Joel Dreyfuss

I'm not sure when journalists were first asked to put down their
notepads and gaze into a crystal ball; maybe they were never
asked at all. I suspect that the ritual of predicting the big
developments of the New Year began when some people in my profession
started taking themselves much too seriously. Somehow, predicting
is in danger of becoming an annual event even in our offices,
where we work hard to keep journalistic egos tightly leashed.

But there's no danger that you'll confuse the editors of InformationWeek
with traveling-sideshow fortune tellers. Our prognostications
are based on solid research and knowledge of the industry.
And we made them for two reasons: The first is that everyone
enjoys reading somebody else's predictions, if only to reinforce
their own feelings of intellectual superiority. But there's
also a second, practical concern: All of us spend so much time
running just to stand still that a look forward can help us
put things in perspective. Our list may even spur you to alter
your technology implementation plans for 1996.

What's Inside

This special issue spotlights the technologies and products
we believe will be making news in 1996. As senior editor Joseph
C. Panettieri points out in his introduction, many of the products
featured will help bring us closer to the idea of the virtual
corporation.

Directory services, advanced network operating systems, groupware,
and Java, among others, all help make geographic location irrelevant
in today's business world. The concept of corporate headquarters
may soon be obsolete. The Internet-that unavoidable, dislocated
entity-may connect us wherever we are, and even whether or
not we want to be connected.

This issue of InformationWeek is unique in several ways. We've
created some nifty interactive links with our Web site (http
//techweb.cmp.com/iwk). Each hot technology listed here will
have a Web resource center to bring together stories we've
done on the subject, and links to related sites. There will
also be some threaded chats and ballots seeking your opinion.
Finally, all the illustrations are by the renowned artist,
Gahan Wilson, His peculiar view of the world seemed just right
for our flight of fancy into the very near future.

Introduction: The New High-Tech Landscape --Tools for building powerful virtual
enterprise networks are now on the horizon

By:
Joseph C. Panettieri

Looking for 1996's hottest information technology trends and
products? The view starts here. Today's technology landscape
is littered with tools for building tomorrow's virtual enterprise
networks. Technologies that were still being tested last year
such as visual development tools and groupware-will be the
basis for crafting the new enterprise structure.

The means are at hand to build communications systems that span
multiple companies, ease information retrieval, and foster
electronic commerce.

For instance, all eyes are on SunSoft's Java scripting language,
which promises a new generation of Internet applications.

After anemic starts, Microsoft's Windows NT and Novell's NetWare
Directory Services should finally provide the needed infrastructure
for distributed network systems. A new version of Lotus Notes
will ratchet up expectations for groupware and could make or
break IBM's $3.5 billion takeover of Lotus Development.

A new generation of client-server development tools will give
technology managers plenty of muscle to build new systems.
Among the products to watch are Borland International's Delphi
and Microsoft's Visual Basic.

Multimedia-ready desktops will provide the delivery vehicle
for applications built using these tools.

Given the hardware demands of such sophisticated client-server
systems, many corporations will turn to robust multiprocessor
servers. Also, the testing cycle will begin on systems using
next-generation 64-bit chips.

There is a plethora of new products on the technology landscape.
The destination is clear: virtual networks that offer anywhere,
anytime information access within and among companies.

The following pages of this special issue suggest how best to
get there.

Online Transactions: Pouring Cash Into The Internet -- In 1995, companies 
learned what they could gain by doing business online. Now they're
ready to make investments

By:
Clinton Wilder

Predicting that electronic commerce will be hot in 1996 is a
bit like predicting that the Super Bowl will be this month's
big media event. To anyone even remotely familiar with the
topic, it's obvious.

If 1995 was the year that the Internet and the World Wide Web
became household words, 1996 is the year that those words will
become gospel to thousands of business and technology managers
around the world. The Web, no longer the sole province of academicians
and Generation X Net surfers, is fast becoming a viable medium
for companies in all industries to post information and take
orders. In addition, 1996 will see technology advances that
will make businesses more comfortable conducting financial
transactions online.

"In terms of absolute growth, business-to-business commerce
online will grow faster this year than business-to-consumer,"
says Torrey Byles, director of electronic commerce for BIS
Strategic Decisions, a market research firm in Santa Clara,
Calif. "As corporate procurement managers get more familiar
with the Net, that will really drive electronic commerce activity.
Because the Net is global, they're beginning to realize the
whole world is their oyster in terms of sourcing."

Several technology areas hold the key to enabling and spurring
the growth of electronic commerce, and all will get significant
attention from vendors in 1996.  That attention will result in
new products and services, new alliances, and, undoubtedly, new
initial public stock offerings.  Among the hot technologies will
be:  Sun's Java scripting language, groupware p.  18), electronic
data interchange (EDI) on the Internet, security, and a new
hardware platform commonly called the Internet PC.

EDI could be the "killer" application that drives more businesses
onto the Internet. That's why Net vendors are seeking to cash
in. Premenos Corp. in Concord, Calif., led the way in 1995
with its Templar software that protects EDI packets on the
Net. And competition looms. Larger EDI players such as IBM,
General Electric Information Services, Sterling Software, and
Harbinger have announced major Internet initiatives or formed
new Internet divisions. "1996 will be a good year for EDI and
the Internet to get married," says Byles of BIS Strategic Decisions.

Of course, electronic commerce won't catch fire unless security
standards are in place. Security experts expect to see more
news reports about obscure flaws discovered in standard encryption
algorithms. There will be continued squabbling between the
Visa-Microsoft and MasterCard-Netscape-IBM alliances over secure
credit-card transaction standards. But experts also expect
to see real advances toward industrial-strength security that
will enable commerce. "Security is still the bugaboo, but a
lot more people now perceive the viability of electronic commerce,"
says David Sims, technical manager of IT at Schlumberger Inc.
in Sugar Land, Texas. "Now that MasterCard and Visa are on
board, you'll see a lot of progress."

Despite the current lack of security and infrastructure to ensure
the safety of large-scale financial transactions on the Internet,
hundreds of companies are moving quickly to make online commerce
a reality. On Jan. 11, AMP Inc. in Harrisburg, Pa., a $4 billion
maker of electronic components, will go live on its Web site
(http://www.connect.amp.com) with an online catalog of 35,000
parts. Using a search engine called Step Search from Saqqara
Systems Inc. in Sunnyvale, Calif., the site will let customers
search in five languages against AMP's Oracle7 database for
specs, prices, and availability of electric connectors, sockets,
and hundreds of other parts in the AMP catalog. Customers will
be able to order samples or place complete orders, then track
the status of those orders on the Web.

AMP's decision was strictly a business investment. "Our executives
are very conservative here," says Jim Kessler, director of
global electronic commerce at AMP. "A lot of what's out there
on the Web today was motivated by emotion; we weren't going
to do that. We looked at hard dollar savings, and there was
more than enough justification." AMP is banking on its Web
site to put a significant dent in its annual $6 million to
$10 million catalog print production costs, increase the productivity
of its sales force, and reach new markets.

Companies such as AMP, General Electric's plastics division,
and National Semiconductor have elected to host their online
parts catalogs on their own Web sites using third-party technology.
In Nat Semi's case, the technology is Java, making it one of
the first significant business applications written in the
Sun language. Nat Semi, in Santa Clara, Calif., developed a
parametric search engine to let its customers find the chips
they need online.

But other large companies have chosen a different route: using
a Web hosting service to deliver product data to their customers
and distributors. Honeywell, Rockwell International's Allen
Bradley unit, and Square D are among 4,000 companies that have
posted home pages on Industry.Net (http://www.industry.net),
a Pittsburgh service that intends to be a one-stop shop for
buyers seeking manufacturing components.

Tom Jones, Industry.Net's VP of marketing, sees the service
as a way for firms to get started in online commerce. He predicts
big changes in attitudes over the next 12 months. "I don't
think [business has] the confidence at this point that the
Internet is a place to do millions of dollars in secure transactions,"
says Jones. "But that will change. As companies put their public
domain information on the Net, and see the type of traffic
and the types of quality customers they get, they'll get much
more comfortable."

Electronic commerce also represents a huge opportunity for large
corporations to blur the lines between being a user and a vendor
of information technology. That often involves partnerships
with large vendors or systems integrators. The Walgreen drugstore
chain, for example, sells its network technology for automatic
filling of doctors' prescriptions to IBM, which in turn sells
the network capability to other customers. "We have a whole
new breed of partners that are also our customers," says Dennie
Welsh, general manager of global services at IBM.

On the consumer side, use of the Web for information will continue
to expand in 1996 but actual purchases over the Net will grow
more slowly and be more niche-oriented. The best bets for growth
will be information-based products. Heading the list are online
publications and software; the latter already enjoys solid
growth on Web sites such as the Internet Shopping Network and
CyberSource's software.net. "The best consumer products to
sell online are [those] that can be investigated, purchased,
and delivered over the Net," says Mike Homer, Netscape's VP
of marketing.

Another boost to online consumer activity this year will be
thousands of new customers choosing to bank electronically.
Although Microsoft and Intuit called off their blockbuster
merger in 1995, they're being just as aggressive in going after
the electronic banking market separately (IW, Dec. 18, p. 14).
Once customers are comfortable with electronic banking, they'll
be more inclined to pay for products and services electronically."In
1996, we'll see electronic banking laying the groundwork for
a comfort level for electronic payments," says Richard Crone,
senior VP and co-director of electronic banking at Home Savings
of America in Irwindale, Calif. "People will first get the
degree of comfort and familiarity by electronic bill-paying."

But brace yourself: The electronic commerce era is still new.
Twelve months from now, 1995 will seem calm by comparison.

Lotus Notes: Sharing The Workload -- Notes put Lotus Development ahead of
the field in groupware. Will Notes 4 keep Lotus in front?

By:
Stephanie Stahl

When Lotus Notes 4, the 1996 release of the innovative Lotus
Development groupware product, was demonstrated a year ago,
a number of the software's loyal, almost cult-like users stood
up and applauded for more than 10 minutes.

There's no question Notes 4 is hot-and much more than an incremental
upgrade. It includes dramatic improvements in scalability,
ease of use, programmability, Internet access, management,
and more. But Notes 4 also will face much more competition
than its predecessors did.

Lotus-now a unit of IBM-began selling Notes in 1989, and singlehandedly
created a new category of computing called groupware. It took
the market and rival vendors a few years to truly understand
what groupware is all about, allowing Lotus to fly solo.

Now, however, corporate America's desire to collaborate on documents
and share information across networks has other vendors angling
for a piece of the action. Software giants such as Microsoft
and Novell, as well as a slew of small, nimble companies, are
breathing down Lotus' neck with their own groupware products.

While none can claim to do exactly what Notes does-with its
application development, replication, and other sophisticated
features-many products provide some of the collaborative features
users are thirsting for.

The numbers speak for themselves: By 1997, the groupware market
is expected to grow to nearly $4 billion, up from $1.3 billion
in 1994, according to First Albany Corp., a research and investment
banking firm in New York. With increasing competition in the
groupware market and sluggish sales of its other products,
Notes 4 could very well be the most important product ever
for Lotus.

"Release 4 is Lotus' only product," says Giles McNamee, an analyst
with First Albany, which is also a Notes user. "Everything
else is decaying. It's just a question of time before they
finish shoveling the dirt over the other products."

But for Lotus to continue to reign in the groupware market,
it must push Notes deeper into the mainstream. The company
is banking on Notes 4, which will make its official debut at
Lotus' annual user group meeting in January, to help it stay
ahead of the pack.

"It's the most important thing they've got," says Jeff Held,
managing partner for the Center For Technology Enablement at
Ernst & Young in New York, a large Notes user. "Notes 4 could
put them way ahead of any competitor if they have a successful
rollout."

For starters, Notes 4 has a much-improved user interface. It
includes drag-and-drop icons, the ability to open multiple
windows, a multipane screen, and more.

"There is nothing intuitive about using Notes Release 3.x,"
says McNamee. "Everything must be learned. The menus are confusing
and deeply hierarchical. It may be a DOS lover's idea of a
cool application, but for a Mac-trained person, the interface
is nothing short of lame."

Lotus agrees there's ample room for improvement. "We are on
a mission to make Notes applications more accessible to a broad
range of people," says Tim Dempsey, director of Notes product
marketing at Lotus.

More Users, Less Space

As Notes becomes a foundation for critical, enterprise-wide
applications, users will require improvements in scalability
and manageability. With Notes 4, Lotus has come up with ways
to host more users per server, take up less network bandwidth
per user, and have fewer administrators watching the network.

Lotus claims that Notes 4 running on multiprocessor platforms
can support up to 1,000 active, concurrent users per server
compared to approximately 100 to 200 users per server on Notes
3.x platforms.

Notes 4 is based on a 32-bit multithreaded architecture that
exploits symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and increases processor
support to six from two. This SMP support means more simultaneous
sessions per server and increased replication capability.

"With a multiprocessing, high-speed architecture, we will be
able to get many more users on a server," says Held. Ernst
& Young, which has about 100 users per Notes server, has deployed
about 200 servers throughout the enterprise, and is only about
halfway finished. The fewer servers the firm will have to manage
in the future, the better, Held says.

Lotus also has included some new management tools in Notes 4
to allow centralized administration of the Notes network. One
provides a common graphical interface for simultaneously managing
several servers from a single console. Another allows administrators
to centralize policymaking and to delegate specific administration
tasks. A third tool lets administrators make changes to any
server, regardless of its location.

Lotus developers also have made big strides in making Notes
more flexible for travelers. "Some of the [biggest payoffs
in] applications involve mobile users," says Dempsey. "Life
needs to be made easier for them."

To that end, Lotus has made managing location profiles easier
in Notes 4. Users can create multiple location configurations,
such as "home" or "hotel," each with information on dialing
rules, home servers, replication, and more.

After that, all they need to do is pick one of the locations
from a status bar and Notes accommodates that environment.

Users also can determine how they want to replicate information
and decide whether they want to receive all new documents or
E-mail messages or just a certain subset. "This provides users
with a much higher degree of control over how they want to
get information back and forth," says Dempsey.

Replication also has been improved to include field-level capability.
With Notes 4, when a user goes to replicate a document, only
new changes are transmitted. Previously, the entire document
had to be transmitted on the network, taking up valuable bandwidth.
"Even if one letter had changed in a document, the whole thing
would have to be replicated," says Held. "[Field-level replication]
will be a great improvement for a large Notes network."

Notes 4 also has a function called "Server PassThrough" that
enables users to make only one call to access multiple Notes
servers. With earlier releases of Notes, users might have to
make multiple calls just to get all the information they need.
Server PassThrough also allows Notes clients on a LAN to connect
to servers running different network protocols.

Noting The Net

In addition, Notes 4 helps users take advantage of one of the
industry's hottest new developments-the Internet. The software's
server version performs as both a Notes server and a Web server.
It includes native support for key Internet protocols, including
HTML, HTTP, and Java. The groupware also includes the InterNotes
Web Navigator, a feature that enables users to incorporate
Internet-based information into their core Notes applications.
Unlike simple Web browsers, which provide access to the Web,
InterNotes Web Navigator allows users to import Web documents
directly into Notes.

Users can take advantage of all of the inherent capabilities
in Notes for getting information off the Net. For example,
they could use Notes' searching and retrieval capabilities
and agent technology to find and import data from the Web.
An agent-software that performs a rule-based function on the
user's behalf-could be built to automatically retrieve information
from a competitor's Web site and import the data into a Notes
database containing competitive information. Notes could then
distribute the information to the company sales force.

InterNotes Web Navigator translates standard Web HTML documents,
including forms, tables, photos, graphics, hyperlinks, and
URLs into Notes. Once a document is pulled into Notes, the
Web links are still live.

"Today, when you pull information from the Web and put it into
a document, its life as a part of the Web is over," says Dempsey.
"With [InterNotes Web Navigator], all of the links are still
available when you open up a document in Notes." So, from a
Notes document, users can jump to Web sites with the click
of a mouse.

Notes users can also pull FTP, Gopher, Usenet, and other Internet
information that exists beyond the Web into Notes applications.
The Navigator resides on the Notes server, eliminating a need
for TCP/IP

on every client. Administrators can deny access to specific
sites.

While some pundits see the Web's global reach and information
access capabilities as a significant threat to Notes, Lotus
insists there is a market for both.

Products such as InterNotes are examples of how the two can
complement each other, Lotus says. "Notes is tailored for the
business user," says Ray Ozzie, the mastermind behind Notes.
"We don't see a direct threat today. We see nothing but opportunities
from the Internet."

For developers, Notes 4 includes Lotus-Script, a cross-platform,
Basic-compatible, object-oriented programming language. "Notes
is really an elaborate development environment in which users
can build workflow and groupware," says First Albany's McNamee.
"Currently, the scripting is so complicated and arduous that
only well-trained, fully dedicated developers can build applications,
says Held. "LotusScript should greatly expand the number of
people who will write applications for Notes."

It's In The (E-)Mail

As the line between groupware and messaging blurs, Lotus is
improving the E-mail capabilities in Notes. Notes 4 has an
integrated client-server messaging engine with a more intuitive
interface based on cc:Mail, Lotus' hot-selling E-mail system.
This provides dramatic improvement over current mail capabilities,
users say. Adds Lotus' Dempsey: "We want to make it a mindless
experience to do Notes mail." Like previous releases of Notes,
Notes 4 runs on a wide variety of operating systems, including
NT, Unix, and OS/2, as well as on Digital Equipment's Alpha
platform. Lotus enters 1996 with slightly more than 3 million
Notes users-a far cry from the 20 million that Lotus' former
CEO, Jim Manzi, set as a goal for 1997.

But even if the company can't achieve that target-and despite
fears about how well historically bureaucratic IBM will develop
the software-one thing appears certain: Notes 4 will be hot
enough to help Lotus maintain its reputation as the premier
groupware vendor and compete against the toughest competition
it's ever faced. Upgrade: Lotus Notes Navigators (top) allow
users to instantly access graphical Notes data or other apps
by clicking on text or a picture. Developers can use workflow
applications (bottom) to build formula-based options into the
design of Notes forms.

Net gains: Notes' Ozzie sees 'nothing but opportunities from
the Internet.'

Directory Services: Finding The Way -- Directory services will help 
guide technology managers through an enterprise filled with important 
information

By:
Caryn Gillooly

Most information technology managers have a data center full
of technologies that are used almost every day, technologies
they can't imagine living without-E-mail and antivirus software,
for example. In 1996, IT managers are going to add a new technology
to that list: directory services.

Actually, directory services are not so new. Novell included
NetWare Directory Services in its release of NetWare 4.1 operating
system more than a year ago, and Banyan Systems Inc. has offered
its directory service for close to 10 years. Outside the network
operating system market, more than a half-dozen other vendors
have offered directory services for almost as long.

But it's only recently that computer vendors and users have
started to understand directory services.

With Novell still encompassing more than half of the LAN market,
its directory service seems to have gotten more attention than
all other products combined.

"Novell has helped educate the market on the importance of a
directory service," wrote Charles Phillips, an analyst at New
York brokerage Morgan Stanley & Co., in a recent report.

Yet many customers still don't understand what directory services
are and how they can benefit organizations. But 1996 just may
be the time to learn: It's the year Novell's directory service
will become widely deployed, as well as the year in which Microsoft
will come on strong with its own directory service.

Before defining what a directory service is, it's necessary
to define the term directory. A directory is a collection of
information-a repository-that usually is specific to one particular
application. It holds all the information relating to that
application, such as user-login data and user-access rights.
Just about every application on a network has its own directory.
The trick is to make the directories work together, which is
where directory services come in.

With a directory service, all applications can share the same
database of user and network information, and it is unnecessary
to replicate the data throughout the network. "Customers have
a whole gamut of directories, from crude to sophisticated.
Something has to manage those directories," says Jay Seaton,
director of worldwide product marketing for the directory solutions
business unit at Banyan in Westboro, Mass. "The directory service
should be viewed as a common service that makes things easy
to find when you have hundreds of thousands of objects on your
network."

All-In-One

Users agree that getting all that information in one place is
essential. "A comprehensive directory service is what companies
need to get all the data under one structure-that's where the
key is," says John Bullivant, systems manager at J.P. Morgan
& Co., a brokerage in New York.

The larger the network, the more important a single structure
becomes. "Any company that wants to have an enterprise solution
has to get into directory services," says Robert Anderson,
a marketing and communications executive at Control Data Systems,
a systems integrator in Minneapolis. "Directory services are
key to any kind of information tracking."

While many directories exist in the largest companies, few such
companies have implemented any sort of directory service, primarily
because the choice of products is still small and the technology
relatively immature.

The market today is segmented into two types of offerings: LAN
based directory services and enterprise directory services,
says David Cappuccio, VP and research director at Garter Group
Inc., an information technology advisory firm in Stamford,
Conn.

On the enterprise side, there are companies such as Control
Data, Unisys, and ICL Ltd. On the LAN side, the leaders are
Novell with NDS and Banyan with its StreetTalk directory service.
IBM, despite its mainframe heritage, also competes in this
market with its Directory and Security Services for OS/2 LAN
Server and Warp Server. Traditionally, LAN-based directory
services have come bundled with the network operating system
and, consequently, have done little more than provide services
for one particular network operating system.

But things are starting to open up. Banyan set the stage in
early 1993 when it announced its Enterprise Network Service
product line. ENS is a separate package made up of Banyan's
messaging, security, and directory services unbundled from
its Vines network operating system. ENS already is available
on NetWare, several different Unix platforms including IBM's
AIX, and Microsoft's Windows NT.

Banyan took the idea a step further by announcing Universal
StreetTalk. The company will make its directory services code
available to anyone who wants to implement it."This is not
just a set of APIs [application programming interfaces]," says
Seaton. "This is literally giving them the directory."

Novell followed suit in September by saying it will publish
a set of APIs that would let NDS act as the directory not only
for NetWare networks, but also for those based on Microsoft's
Windows NT, IBM's OS/2, and others. "We're going to put NDS
on all other platforms that make sense," says David Clare,
a product manager at Novell.

Even Microsoft has decided to get into the directory services
game. Today, Microsoft doesn't really have a directory service.
There are domain-based services included in NT, but they don't
compare with an industrial-strength directory services such
as NDS. Microsoft says it will ship a true directory service
sometime in 1997 with Cairo, a major upgrade of NT. But it
won't be Microsoft's sole directory; a different one-but upwardly
compatible with Cairo's directory-is expected in Exchange,
the company's messaging and groupware product that is slated
to ship in the first quarter of 1996.

To resolve any potential application conflicts, Microsoft in
September announced the Open Directory Services Interface-its
own directory services API. With ODSI, applications developers
can write to a single API, and their application can access
any directory service that also interfaces with ODSI. That
way, applications can be written independently from any specific
directory service and developers won't have to choose a winner.
Other vendors such as Novell initially agreed to support it,
but they now seem to be backing away from their commitments.

Standards bodies also play a significant role in directory services.
The Open Software Foundation's Distributed Computing Environment
(DCE) includes specifications for building an enterprisewide,
distributed directory service, along with specifications for
distributed security, distributed mail services, remote communications,
and more. While Novell says it will make its directory interoperate
with DCE systems, IBM's directory is based on the DCE specifications.

The advantage: DCE can run on all platforms, from the lowest
end PCs to the highest-end mainframes-all of which IBM offer.
"The one thing IS really wants is a name service that deals
with the whole IS structure-scalability to all platforms,"
says Gary Gunnerson, technology chief at USA Today's Information
Network in Arlington, Va.

DCE also can bring its other services-in addition to directory
services-across such a range of platforms. "DCE provides one
secure logon to all systems, including mainframes and Unix
machines," says Lisa Laing, a network systems analyst at McGill
University in Montreal. IBM's DCE directory service is expected
to be available soon.

This cross-platform view is where the enterprise offerings have
the advantage. Companies such as Control Data Systems, ICL,
and Unisys offer directory service products based on X.500,
the International Standards Organisation's framework for developing
an enterprise directory service. Like DCE, X.500 spans platforms.
But X.500 has become more of a gateway solution, a common way
to connect other directory services. "X.500 has the opportunity
and is the only standard out there to be the Esperanto of the
directory world," says Tim Sloane, director of electronic messaging
at the Aberdeen Group Inc., a consulting firm in Boston.

Until recently, the LAN- and enterprise-based directory service
markets were separate. But the two are starting to come together
as LANs become more enterprisewide, and as enterprise-based
products begin to reach down into individual network segments.
Also fueling this convergence is the introduction of directory
service tools specifically designed to bridge that gap.

A Leg Up

The merging of the two markets will get an added boost when
applications begin to stretch from LAN to enterprise networks.
"Directory services has always been behind-the-scenes infrastructure
technology," says Banyan's Seaton. "But as it starts to be
integrated into the applications, the value becomes much more
significant."

Many customers already understand the significance of directory
services. "For our purposes, we needed one place for all the
network information," says Niraj Patel, network and telecommunication
manager at GMAC Mortgage, a NetWare 4 customer in Elkins Park,
Pa. "We went to NetWare 4 because of NDS. It's great to have
a central NDS server to do all of the management."

Until two years ago, W.R. Grace & Co. used Digital Equipment's
PathWorks network operating system. But PathWorks didn't have
a directory service, so the company decided to look for something
else, according to Jonathan Prigot, supervisor of technical
support at the Boca Raton, Fla., chemical company. Grace chose
NetWare 4. "Since we were looking at a corporate network operating
system to bind the company locations into a cohesive whole,
directory services was high on our list," Prigot says.

With the system in place for more than a year, Prigot says he
now appreciates the full benefits of NDS: "It organizes my
resources wonderfully. I get a complete diagram, including
who's on what server and what resources are being used." Grace
still has Hewlett-Packard OpenMail E-mail boxes for employees,
but Prigot says he plans to bring even those mailboxes under
NDS. "We plan to integrate in as much as possible," he says.
"Our ultimate plan is to have one massive directory structure
based on NetWare." But most companies don't have the benefits
of a directory service. For many, installing one is simply
too daunting a task. "It's imposing," says John Miller, a former
data communications specialist at HealthCare Compare Corp.
in Downers Grove, Ill. "[Our] people are comfortable with NetWare

3.11 and 3.12. They're taking classes [on NetWare 4], but that's
about all they're doing."

Some customers see it differently. "For four years we had to
figure out how to manage 100 NetWare servers without a directory,"
says Chuck Rush, global networking manager at fast-food franchiser
McDonald's Corp. in Oak Brook, Ill. "What we have works now.
Since nothing's broken and nobody's screaming, we're going
to wait."

Yet even companies that don't yet have directory services see
the benefit. "It's worth moving to directory services. It's
got a lot to offer," says Miller of HealthCare. "You have to
take a long view. The short view says everything is working
fine. But with a long view, you're no longer managing one server,
you're managing one network."

Even more compelling is the potential for what directory services
can do once the technology and market has matured. "You'll
use directory services to store electronic forms and use it
as an information database for calendaring, scheduling, and
even workflow processes," says Control Data's Anderson. Novell's
Clare agrees: "Directory services is going to be the heart
of the network, from the departmental LAN to global networks."

Windows NT: Bringing In The Best Windows -- Disdained when it first came
out, NT gets second looks

By:
Joseph C. Panettieri

Flash back to the summer of 1993: jurassic Park was smashing
box-office records.

A new First Lady was trying to reinvent the American health
care system. And technology managers were scratching their
heads over Microsoft's 32-bit operating system, Windows NT.

Microsoft chairman and CEO Bill Gates was bullish on his new
product, boldly predicting NT would sell 1 million copies in
its first year.

But the brash Mr. Gates would be proved wrong. Corporations
simply weren't willing to deploy an unproven operating system
that required loads of memory and lacked networking and application
support. Insiders say Windows NT sold less than 400,000 copies
its first year.

Zoom forward to today. While millions of consumers just unwrapped
PCs employing Microsoft's Windows 95, corporate America is
set to ring in the new year with a new look at the 30-month
old NT. "Just about every company we've spoken with has spent
the last two years piloting NT," says Bob Sakakeeny, an analyst
at Boston consulting firm Aberdeen Group Inc. "Those pilots
will turn into deployments this year."

Microsoft won't disclose NT's installed base, but observers
peg it at between 2 million and 4 million units. One by one,
corporations are entrusting their department workstations and
servers to NT, betting that there's life for Microsoft beyond
the traditional desktop PC.

According to more than one market research firm, monthly NT
Server sales have topped 30,000 units since last summer. Those
taking the NT plunge read like a Who's Who of corporate America
 the Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa), Charles Schwab, Chevron,
General Electric, J.C. Penney, Kmart, MCI, and Sprint, among
others.

Experts say NT is enjoying success especially in three key vertical
markets: retail, finance, and energy. For example, "Chevron,
Pennzoil, and Lyondell are moving to NT with a vengeance,"
says Mike Brule, president of Technomation Systems Inc., a
systems integrator in Houston that works closely with oil companies
and helped Amoco Corp. install an NT network. Amoco is using
NT for a custom application that helps company engineers estimate
the cost of potential oil explorations.

Getting Focused

Computer hardware vendors have not lost sight of this trend.
Digital Equipment is training hundreds of engineers to support
Windows NT on systems employing both its Alpha RISC (reduced
instruction set computing) microprocessors and those from Intel
Corp. Says Tim Miller, strategic marketing manager for Alpha
at Digital, "Our long-term operating system strategy is one
that's processor-independent, driven by NT moving down into
the mainstream."

Late last year, NetFrame Systems Inc., a leading maker of servers
running Novell NetWare, hedged its bets and began shipping
fault-tolerant four-way multiprocessor servers preloaded with
NT. Likewise, NEC is preparing multiprocessor NT Servers powered
by Silicon Graphics Inc.'s forthcoming MIPS R10000 chip.

While Microsoft's most recent iteration of Windows, Windows
95, is expected to become the mainstream desktop operating
system, adoption has been slow on the corporate side. Instead,
NT may represent Microsoft's best shot at securing a seat in
enterprise networks. That's because the 32-bit NT supports
symmetric multiprocessing, pre-emptive multitasking, and multiple
hardware architectures, including Intel and several RISC chips
 the PowerPC from Apple, IBM, and Motorola; Silicon Graphics'
MIPS line; and Digital's Alpha series.

Windows NT may have been slow out of the gate, but it always
showed promise. For example, NT's initial release was stable
and contained few "showstopper" bugs capable of crashing an
entire server. That allowed NT to survive until its first upgrade,
version 3.5 (code-named Daytona), shipped in September 1994.
NT 3.5 quickly won praise from corporate testers, who cited
its enhanced connectivity to TCP/IP and NetWare networks, extended
dial-up features, and a growing catalog of application support.
Microsoft followed in mid-1995 with the release of NT 3.51,
the first version of NT to run on the PowerPC.

This year, Microsoft will upgrade NT with the Windows 95 user
interface, an enhanced E-mail inbox known as Exchange Client,
and support for TAPI, a programming interface for building
applications that are integrated with telephone systems.

In 1997, Microsoft hopes to ship the long-delayed NT upgrade
known as Cairo. That upgrade will support an object-oriented
architecture in the form of Network OLE and a new object file
system that will enable information retrieval across distributed
networks. After Cairo, there may be a 64-bit version of NT,
sources say.

Two Systems In One

Windows NT, like Unix and OS/2, can serve two operating system
functions. Its 32-bit engine and graphical interface make it
appropriate as a standalone workstation operating system. Because
it is a stable, multiprocessing, networking system, it also
performs well as a server. In fact, NT has had its best success
so far as a departmental network server. Many companies are
using Windows NT for simple file and print services, as a database
server, or as an applications server.

"NT is clearly gaining momentum," says Larry Shaw, a client
server architect at Seattle retail giant Nordstrom, which has
more than 170 NT Servers. "NT has taken off," says Bob McDowell,
VP of Microsoft's enterprise customer unit. As a result, some
companies are making the switch from older, established operating
systems to NT.

Countrywide Mortgage of Pasadena recently migrated more than
40 servers running Lotus Notes and supporting more than 3,000
users to NT. Those servers had run Notes on top of OS/2. But
Notes scales better on the Microsoft operating system, say
insiders at Countrywide.

NT offers several distinct advantages as a server, including
system and management add-ons Microsoft has developed to work
with it. Pennzoil this year plans to deploy the popular R/3
client-server software from SAP AG on NT and SQL Server, Microsoft's
enterprise database system. "Using NT and SQL Server is a great
way to avoid integration headaches," says Britt Mayo, director
of information technology at Pennzoil in Houston.

Microsoft has found success marketing NT and SQL Server together
because SQL Server leverages the familiar Windows interface
and uses setup routines that are similar to Microsoft's desktop
applications. In fact, International Data Corp., a market research
firm in Framingham, Mass., says annual sales of NT database
servers surpassed those of IBM OS/2 database servers in 1995,
and predicts that NT will surpass NetWare in that category
this year, making NT the No. 2 database server behind Unix.
"Microsoft has successfully targeted the database server market
with NT," declares Dan Kusnetzky, research manager for Unix
and advanced operating environments at IDC.

Just ask Nordstrom, which uses NT and SQL Server to route clothing
to its nationwide stores. Also, Alliant Food Service, formerly
a division of Kraft Foods, is using Microsoft's Systems Management
Server along with NT and SQL Server to distribute software
electronically across its network.

Reaching Out

NT's appeal has begun to extend beyond database servers. A handful
of enterprise applications is finally available for the operating
system, including Computer Associates' Unicenter management
platform, Lotus' Notes groupware, IBM's CICS transaction processor,
and Microsoft's own BackOffice, a suite of server applications
for NT that includes database, messaging, mainframe gateway,
and systems management software.

This year may see NT proliferate on the desktop as a powerful
alternative to Unix as a workstation operating system. More
than 40 companies, including MCI and Hewlett-Packard, each
plan to deploy NT Workstation on more than 10,000 PCs. That
proliferation will be helped by an outpouring of 32-bit productivity
applications for Windows 95, including programs from Microsoft,
Starfish Software, and Lotus, many of which have been certified
to run on NT. "NT is gaining more and more applications support,"
says Kusnetzky.

FirePower Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif., is among the first vendors
to sell NT-based PowerPCs, and more hardware support-from RISC
and Intel system vendors-is on the way. Compaq Computer, Dell,
and others this year are expected to introduce NT systems powered
by Intel's latest chip, the Pentium Pro.

NT is expected to be more widely used than Windows 95 on the
Pentium Pro, because the chip is optimized for operating systems
that are fully 32-bit. Windows 95 contains some 16-bit code
to ensure compatibility with Windows 3.x applications.

In addition to new NT hardware platforms, significant software
for NT from Microsoft also will hit the market this year. First
up is Gibraltar, Microsoft's just-released Internet server
software for NT. Gibraltar is causing a stir among NT users,
and aims to challenge Unix's popularity as a doorway to the
Internet. "I can't wait to get my hands on Gibraltar for testing,"
says NT user Matt Merrick, VP of information systems at Merrick
Printing Co. of Louisville, Ky.

Incoming Upgrade

Also coming is the long-delayed Exchange Server, Microsoft's
NT-based messaging and groupware upgrade to MS Mail Server.
Exchange Server isn't expected to match the groupware capabilities
of Lotus Notes, but it does promise to relieve the scalability
headaches companies encounter with MS Mail.

Analysts say NT's momentum should carry throughout the year,
but the competition is not sitting still.

Novell shipped the first SMP version of NetWare 4.1 in December,
and IBM this quarter is expected to release OS/2 Warp Server,
which will combine its LAN Server network operating system
with the easy-to-use Warp operating system. "Warp Server technology
is strong, and its systems management features are powerful,"
says IDC's Kusnetzky. "But its superior technology could be
considered a moot point; OS/2 is lagging in corporate mindshare
because of Microsoft's marketing expertise with NT."

One place Microsoft clearly trails IBM is in the area of enterprise
services and support. In an effort to compensate, Microsoft
late last year opened NT support centers in Europe and in Asia,
allowing the software giant to offer global 24-hour support
for multinational companies. Microsoft has more than 1,000
employees trained on NT, and has recruited AT&T Global Information
Solutions, Digital Equipment, and Hewlett-Packard to help support
NT globally. These developments indicate NT is poised to establish
itself on corporate America's department workstations and servers.

Multiprocessor Systems: PC Multiplier -- Windows NT teams with fast PC 
servers to bring symmetric multiprocessing into the corporate mainstream

By:
Brian Gillooly

How can symmetric multiprocessing, a technology that's been
around for years, be hot for 1996? Because, thanks to the proliferation
of Microsoft's Windows NT and the raw power of Intel's Pentium
Pro processor, low-cost, high-performance, reliable PC-based
multiprocessing servers will finally become a familiar component
of the corporate enterprise.

For years, technology managers shunned SMP servers because of
unreliable operating systems, high cost, and unproven promises
in performance. But according to vendors and industry market
research firms, 1996 will see an explosion of SMP server sales,
outpacing even the huge expansion of the overall server market.

Customers like USAir Group Inc.'s operations research division
seek to leverage the price-performance advantages of x86-based
SMP servers. Lloyd Blauen, Unix LAN administrator for USAir
in Arlington, Va., says the company has begun installing several
SMP-based IBM PC servers and plans to add more across the operations
research division once the SMP version of IBM's OS/2 Warp is
available early in January. "Warp SMP is pretty robust," says
Blauen, "and there are applications we're writing that definitely
require SMP power."

Like USAir, many companies kicked the SMP tires in 1995. James
McDonnell, marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard's Network
Server division, says it's significant that customers now seem
to be less skittish about SMP technology moving into the new
year. "1995 was the year for pouring the foundation, and in
1996, the studs go up," McDonnell says.

Ready To Roll

PC makers say the crucial testing stage for SMP servers is nearly
complete, and pent-up demand is about to be satisfied. "A lot
of large corporate customers have deployed servers in a pilot
environment and are now ready to blast it across the enterprise,"
says John Thompson, director of systems platform marketing
for Compaq's systems division.

That paints a bright future for this technology. Dave Ellenberger,
VP of corporate marketing for Data General Corp. in Westboro,
Mass., anticipates at least 30% growth in the low-end SMP server
market this year.

Gene Austin, VP of marketing for Compaq's systems division in
Houston, is even more bullish. He believes the overall x86
based server market will grow about 50% this year, while the
SMP segment will balloon 60% to 75%

"The Pentium Pro will drive a lot of it because you get multiprocessing
systems in the $15,000-to-$20,000 range in powerful boxes,"
says Austin. "It's cheap horsepower."

Price point aside, Austin says information technology managers
are more willing to install SMP servers because the operating
systems are "a lot stronger."

Compaq should know. Out of 600 sites that have installed SAP's
R/3 client-server financial system on Windows NT-based SMP
servers, about half are using the Houston manufacturer's hardware.

David House, general manager of Intel's enterprise computing
group in Santa Clara, Calif., agrees that today's more robust
operating systems will help speed adoption of SMP. "The operating
system, where the rubber meets the road, is much better at
handling

SMP today," he notes.

Compaq says users are responding in kind. "We're not having
to do too much convincing on NT being robust enough," says
Compaq's Thompson.

Customers are finding that the performance, security, and reliability
of the 32-bit software are adequate for running many enterprise
level applications, Thompson says. "Any SAP site is a bet-your
business site," he adds.

There will be 2.4 million SMP servers-both x86 and RISC (reduced
instruction set computing)-shipped worldwide this year, according
to International Data Corp., a market research firm in Framingham,
Mass.

But it is the low-cost, high-volume equation that Intel is pushing
with its Pentium Pro chip and motherboard strategy that will
expand the x86 SMP server market.

The high-end SMP server industry is "largely still proprietary
and still fragmented," says Steve Smith, an analyst with brokerage
PaineWebber in New York. But Intel's approach will change that.
"If you take the volume side of the equation and leverage that
for the entire industry, that's what is different now," he
says.

Also, for the first time, servers are being optimized for multiprocessing.
"The hardware and software are being designed to do a specific
function, and when you add Lotus Notes or some other workgroup
application, you get a machine designed top-to-bottom as a
whole solution," says Michael Coleman, general manager for
the IBM PC Co.'s server business. "That's what people are getting
excited about."

Fred DeBoer, network services director for Advanced Technology
Labs, a Bothell, Wash., manufacturer of diagnostic ultrasound
equipment, says his company plans to roll out an SMP version
of Novell's GroupWise messaging system, known as GroupWise
XTD, on low-cost NetFrame 8540 servers by the mid 1996.

"Businesses are realizing that SMP isn't technology we should
be into, but rather technology we better be into," says DeBoer.

NT's Role

Corporate customers also are becoming more comfortable with
running enterprise-level applications on PC-based SMP servers
as they see more successful deployments by their peers.

"Four years ago, less than 10% of x86-based servers were running
Oracle. Now it's more than 40%," says Larry Ellison, CEO of
Oracle in Redwood Shores, Calif.

The advancement of Windows NT is crucial for the expansion of
the low-cost x86-based SMP server market-and vendors say corporate
America is responding. Kevin Roberts, product manager for high
performance PC workstations at Advanced Logic Research Inc.
in Irvine, Calif., says about 15% of all machines Advanced
Logic ships are loaded with Windows NT. That figure is expected
to grow to 40% by mid-1996 and to nearly 50% near year's end.

Financial firms, comforted by the security features they find
in Windows NT, are among the early adopters of the operating
system.

Combined with what HP's McDonnell calls "the midyear kicker"
of the Windows 95 interface being built into Windows NT, SMP
servers will become more popular in general business-productivity
environments. "That helps because it adds more [support] to
the message," McDonnell says.

Compaq's Thompson says the company ended 1994 with several Windows
NT Server installations in the 50-unit range. Now, he says,
Compaq is logging orders for 1,000 or more NT Servers, about
70% of which are two-way or four-way SMP servers.

One of the clear advantages Windows NT has over Unix in an SMP
server environment is its lack of complexity. "Unix could use
a friendlier interface," says ALR's Roberts. "Unity among all
the different flavors of Unix would be a nice start."

The Pentium Factor

But just as the acceptance of new, robust software will help
expand the SMP server market, hardware factors in heavily.

HP's McDonnell refers to Intel's Pentium Pro processor as "a
pivotal product," not only because it is a high-performance
chip at a relatively low cost, but because it will help drive
x86-based SMP servers higher into the enterprise. So the foundation
for moving upscale has been set. Pentium servers such as HP's
NetServer LS and Compaq's ProLiant 4500 are solid platforms
from which corporate America can now migrate upward to two
way and four-way servers.

Data General, which for years has focused on SMP servers on
the Motorola 88000 platform, made a wholesale conversion to
Intel's Pentium and Pentium Pro to capitalize on high-volume
sales opportunities in the future. "We expect the low end of
server computing to be defined by the Intel architecture,"
says VP Ellenberger. He adds that while the Unix-versus-Windows
NT debate continues, Data General will offer its DG-UX operating
system as well as NT.

"One of the desirables in the SMP space has always been lots
of shrink-wrapped applications," says Ellenberger. "Unix has
never lived up to this, and probably never will. But as [a
shift to Intel's high-volume SMP motherboard] concept occurs,
software vendors see more volume for a port."

PC makers for years have fought the characterization of PC-based
servers as weak and unmanageable. Most have been used as no
more than file-and-print servers, where the need for multiprocessing
is minimal.

But beginning early in 1995, vendors began paying more attention
to the management side of server technology, and software like
IBM's NetFinity, Compaq's Insight Manager, and HP's NetManager
became the competitive selling point for the servers.

"This brought about a change in the use of PC servers," says
IBM PC Co.'s Coleman. IBM plans to create an end-to-end enterprise
security blanket for its server line in 1996 by integrating
NetFinity server-management software with NetView systems-management
technology. "Right now, it's not seamless, tightly integrated,
or fully functional," adds Coleman. "We'll integrate several
products in stage one into a workgroup product."

Coleman says products like IBM's SystemView, which provide fully
integrated system management, enable customers to eliminate
some of the middle layers of management software to save money
and give the system administrator greater control over the
entire corporate enterprise.

With this higher level of management and availability, customers
now have more confidence in the ability of SMP servers to handle
vital business applications. Frank DeVito, information systems
manager for Rogers and Wells, a large New York law firm, says
that with real estate at a premium and a small network administration
staff, it's now crucial to be able to consolidate servers into
larger SMP models and have iron-clad server-management tools.

"We can run more NLMs [NetWare Loadable Modules] on the same
box without it taking a toll on the horsepower of the CPU,"
says DeVito.

Rogers and Wells already has deployed several Compaq ProLiant
4500 servers in an SMP configuration running Windows NT SQL
Server, and it plans to take the rest of its half-dozen or
so ProLiants to SMP when NetWare is boosted to that level.

"We're looking forward to more multiprocessing database applications
in NetWare once we're able to scale beyond a single processor,"
says DeVito.

With the robustness and reliability of Windows NT and the cheap
horsepower supplied by the Pentium Pro, IT managers are finding
single-processor systems fast becoming an arcane and expensive
way to approach client-server computing in the corporate enterprise.
In simple terms, that means 1996 is shaping up to be a blockbuster
year for low-cost SMP servers.

High-Speed Processors: Plugging In 64-Bit Chips -- Systems based on superfast 
processors are on the horizon

By:
John Foley

If you consider yourself leading edge because you just upgraded
to 32-bit software and left the 16-bit world behind, think
again. An entirely new generation of systems, based on superfast
64-bit microprocessors, is about to hit the streets.

Power users can expect to see big advances in microprocessor
performance in 1996. Two giants in the world of RISC (reduced
instruction set computing) processors, Sun Microsystems Inc.
and Hewlett-Packard, introduced their first 64-bit chips late
in 1995-and systems based on those chips will be rolled out
this year. IBM and Motorola plan a midyear release of the PowerPC
620, a 64-bit version of their jointly developed microprocessor
line.

Two veterans of 64-bit computing, Digital Equipment and Silicon
Graphics' Mips Technologies subsidiary, also plan upgrades
that will significantly boost their already powerful devices.

"Users are very hungry for them," says John Logan, a VP with
the Aberdeen Group, a research and consulting firm in Boston.
"We can already see the advantages with Digital's Alpha." The
new chips aren't for the timid. They offer raw speed, huge
memory cache, and support for very large file systems-and cost
up to 50% more than 32-bit chips. Initially, Sun and HP will
offer their chips-the UltraSparc I and the PA-8000, respectively
only in their top-of-the-line workstations and servers.

By the year 2000, however, 64-bit chips will become the norm.
"The move to 64-bit processing is as inevitable as night following
day," says Mike Lambert, VP of technical strategy with X/Open,
the independent standards organization in Menlo Park, Calif.
Is 64-bit-ness worth the migration headaches-applications need
to be rewritten or recompiled to reap maximum benefit-and the
extra cost? If sales of Digital's 64-bit Alpha chip are any
indication, a growing number of users think so: Digital's Alpha
business grew by 77% in fiscal 1995, which ended in July.

Experts say two factors-graphics-intensive computing and the
need for heavy-duty databases-are driving 64-bit technology.
Typical examples: Pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beecham in
Philadelphia is tapping Alpha systems to store and analyze
data in an application that involves simulating molecules.
Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford, Conn., has deployed a cluster
of Alphas for jet-engine design.

The Milwaukee Journal/Sentinel chose two Alpha-based servers
to replace two Unisys V-380 "light" mainframes. Peter Stockhausen,
the newspaper's VP of information technologies, says his company
also looked at IBM's AS/400 minicomputer and an HP midrange
system. "The HP and IBM were fairly comparable to each other,"
he says. "Digital was significantly faster in total throughput."
The Journal/Sentinel now runs its customer-service database
and billing system on the Alpha servers. Bottom-line benefits
include faster access to customer records and better customer
service.

A major advantage these new chips offer is that 64-bit computing
breaks through the 4-Gbyte memory limit of 32-bit systems.
Digital's Alpha Server 8000, for instance, supports 14 Gbytes
of memory. The larger cache makes it possible to process huge
chunks of data on a single chip.

"With 64 bits, you can have one big application running in memory,"
says Patrick Smyth, director of marketing with Digital's Unix
business segment in Maynard, Mass. "That translates into dramatically
improved performance and much shorter response times," he adds.

Record-Breaking Benchmark

The proof behind these performance claims? In December, Oracle
announced a record-breaking benchmark of 11,456 tpmC (transactions
per minute based on the C set of benchmark tests created by
the Transaction Processing Performance Council in San Jose,
Calif.) for its Oracle7 database. The benchmark was set using
an eight-processor Alpha server running Digital's 64-bit Unix
operating system.

Another technical barrier that's smashed by a 64-bit architecture
is file size. A 64-bit file system can handle much larger files
than a 32-bit system-a decided advantage as images and video
become part of a file system.

But sheer speed is the most talked-about advantage of a 64-bit
world. Chipmakers are already one-upping each other with claims
of world-leading performance. On Nov. 2, HP announced release
of the PA-8000, billed as having "the highest performance available
today," 8.6 SPECint95 (a measure of CPU Integer performance
by Standard Performance Evaluation Corp. in Manassas, Va.).
Less than two weeks later, Digital announced sampling of its
Alpha 21164, touted as "the world's fastest and highest performance
microprocessor," at 11 SPECint95.

Living In The Real World

Experts warn users not to get caught up in the benchmark brouhaha.
"We discount the meaningfulness of a spec number [because]
it doesn't reflect what a real-world application with real
world data is like," says Steve Schick, a spokesman for Mips
Technologies in Mountain View, Calif. Mips' redesigned 64-bit
chip, the R10000, will go into production in January.

"The better measure is when you get down to real applications,"
agrees Arthur Goldberg, executive VP with HAL Computer Systems,
a Campbell, Calif., subsidiary of Fujitsu. HAL just began shipping
workstations based on its own Sparc-compatible 64-bit chip,
the Sparc64.

In other words, technology managers should try before they buy.
But regardless of the processor, it's fair to expect a major
performance improvement when pumping an existing application
through a 64-bit machine. A typical example: HP says 32-bit
applications will run 70% to 100% faster on its PA-8000.

There are important differences in 64-bit platforms. Silicon
Graphics Inc., for instance, is the market leader in "floating
point" performance, important for 3-D and graphical applications
such as animation. Silicon Graphics' customers include Disney
and Ford Motor Co. With the R10000, says Schick, Silicon Graphics
is concentrating on "reducing bottlenecks that hang up a processor,"
rather than devoting all of its attention to the sheer speed
of the chip. The goal is improved database performance. "We've
been running database trace code, and so far it is proved out
that there's a huge difference in performance," says Schick.

Silicon Graphics attributes the R10000's performance improvements
to two techniques: dynamic scheduling and nonblocking caches.
The former improves processor efficiency by "reordering" instructions
to suit the execution resources of the chip. The latter keeps
the processor active rather than waiting for data it may later
need to complete an operation.

Sun is challenging Silicon Graphics with the UltraSparc I, which
it bills as "the world's first general purpose microprocessor
to deliver on-chip support for MPEG-2 decode." MPEG-2 is an
industry standard for broadcast-quality video.

Digital and HAL Systems, on the other hand, concede the high
end graphics niche to Silicon Graphics. "We don't pretend to
think we can compete with them in the entertainment business
at the high end," says Bill Glazier, Digital's director of
workstation marketing in Maynard, Mass.

Digital has its own bragging rights. It is one of the few 64
bit chip suppliers with a 64-bit operating system, Digital
Unix. Sun's Solaris and HP's HP-UX are 32-bit operating systems
that have been tuned for 64-bit chips but are unable to take
full advantage of the 64-bit architecture. In addition, Digital
sells Microsoft's 32-bit Windows NT operating system for the
Alpha.

Rich Sevcik, VP and general manager of HP's systems technology
group in Cupertino, Calif., acknowledges that 32-bit software
cannot take full advantage of 64-bit hardware. "You can increase
the clock rate [of the application], but that has nothing to
do with 64-bit-ness," he says.

No Need To Rush

HP has promised to deliver a 64-bit version of HP-UX in the
second half of 1996. Once done, applications still need to
be written or recompiled to run in 64-bit mode. "There are
very few 64-bit apps in the world," says Sevcik. "In commercial
environments, we're not going to see 64-bit applications for
three to five years."

Indeed, for most organizations, there's no need to rush into
64-bit computing, says Sevcik. Fewer than 5% of current HP
systems ship with the maximum 4 Gbytes of memory, evidence
of untapped potential on 32-bit systems. The extra power of
64-bit processors, he says, is mainly needed for high-end database
applications. "If you're doing something like decision support,
it's worth paying for the large memory," says Sevcik. "You'll
get some benefit from that."

Graphics-intensive computing is the other big strength of 64
bit chips, making them a good match for the real-time multimedia
applications soon to appear on the World Wide Web. However,
PowerPC partners IBM and Motorola, and PC chip giant Intel
agree with HP's analysis-that 32-bit chips will continue to
meet the needs of most users. In fact, the 32-bit PowerPC 604
is nearly as powerful as the 64-bit PowerPC 620.

This is a dilemma that has caused IBM and Motorola to delay
the 620's release until mid-1996. They hope to widen the performance
gap between the two processors over the next six months.

Intel and HP are partnering on a 64-bit architecture that combines
the two dominant chip technologies: RISC and CISC (complex
instruction set computing). The partners have yet to announce
a microprocessor based on the HP-Intel Architecture, but experts
expect a 64-bit chip, called the P7, in 1997 or later. Until
then, Intel will be pushing Pentium Pro, a 32-bit processor
released in November.

Long-term planners have their sights set on the new generation
of 64-bit chips and beyond. "Today's move toward 64-bit file
systems and 64-bit processing are just stages in the evolution
of information technology," says X/Open's Lambert. "It is important
to recognize this and not develop solutions for 64-bit that
are not sufficient for 128-bit and beyond."

Voice Messaging: A Smart Service -- Wildfire has unveiled an electronic 
assistant that can answer, forward, and identify calls-while still sounding
human

By:
Mary E. Thyfault

The hottest, hippest new must-have for the upwardly mobile professional
is the Wildfire Electronic Assistant. If you don't have one
or at least know somebody who does-that's likely to change
this year. If your job depends on your phone, Wildfire can
change your life.

The system, offered by Wildfire Communications Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., runs on a server that handles all incoming and outgoing
voice communications, no matter where you are. Users dial a
number to access their own pre-programmed Wildfire Assistant.
Then, a computerized female voice-which doesn't sound computerized
at all-uses voice recognition technology to prompt users through
the management of their incoming and outgoing voice communications.

Beyond handling voicemail, the system, at the user's voice request,
can quickly return calls to people who left a message. During
a Wildfire session, the system will even interrupt itself to
announce and connect the user to incoming calls.

Wildfire can forward calls to any phone and tell hotel operators,
"I'm looking for John Doe." Like any good assistant, it lets
users screen calls on the fly or by using a preprogrammed list.
If you don't answer a call, Wildfire can tell you who is calling
by sending a message via a pager.

The real power of Wildfire will be evident as virtual workgroups
grow more common. For example, Wildfire can let a developer,
contractor, and real estate agent communicate as if they were
using the same office voicemail system and personal assistant.
If the real estate agent and contractor called their Wildfire
Assistants at the same time, they could connect and talk to
each other from two distant pay phones.

Wildfire also can call users in a restaurant during a long lunch,
reminding them that it's time to move on to the next appointment.
"It's the beginning of the growth of machines talking to people
on behalf of people," says Paul Saffo, a Wildfire user and
director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.

It's also addictive. Says Rick Smolan of Sausalito, Calif.,
"If I had to choose between my car and Wildfire, I would probably
give up my car." Smolan is president of Against All Odds Productions,
which just produced the book, The Passage To Vietnam. While
assembling the book, his Wildfire Assistant called him every
day in Vietnam with messages, then dialed all his outgoing
calls, saving expensive hotel phone charges. "It's like having
a little person following you around," Smolan says. "At a pay
phone, I can get things done in minutes that used to take an
hour."

That's because Wildfire helps eliminate voicemail tag. Currently,
about 75% of all calls fail to connect with the intended recipient,
and most end up in voicemail, the company says. At the same
time, Wildfire enables time-pressured professionals to politely
screen out all non-urgent phone calls.

It also helps juggle demanding clients and dual professional
lives. Take Chris Gregory: By day, he's director of sales and
client services for Video-It in Culver City, Calif., the country's
oldest post-production house. By night, he does commercial
voiceovers for products such as the Ginsu knife, Nordic Track
exercise machines, and Packard Bell computers. Missing a call
can cost Gregory $300 to $1,000. "If I don't get back to someone
in five to 10 minutes," he says, "they're dialing someone else."

A few months ago, Wildfire began licensing companies to offer
the Wildfire Electronic Assistant as a dial-in service, eliminating
the need to buy a $50,000 server. Wildfire has licensed the
service to three bureaus that offer the service for as little
as $39 a month, though heavy users are more likely to spend
$150 to $250 a month.

Licensees include Advanced Communications Inc. in Effingham,
Ill., which targets Wildfire to sales and marketing entrepreneurs;
Milcom Corp. in Wilmington, Mass., which is marketing to New
England and Northeast professionals; and Virtuosity, which
already counts N.Y.P.D. Blue co-executive producer and director
Mike Robins as a user, is targeting the capital of hip: Los
Angeles.

Purchasing a service instead of a $50,000 server is catching
on like ... well, let's just say that Wildfire co-founder Nick
d'Arbeloff believes "it's possible that the service business
could overwhelm the server business fairly quickly." One reason
may be that those people who can't drop $50,000 for a server
"may well be more in need of Wildfire than their corporate
counterparts" who have support staff, he says.

Quick Response

Wildfire seems to work well for CambridgeCAD Technologies Inc.,
a four-person Apple and IBM reseller that is on call constantly
to provide customer support. "It's critical that we respond
to our customers quickly, and this is much better than pagers
or portable phones," says Dan Tully, executive VP of the Cambridge,
Mass., company.

"It frees us so that we don't have to have somebody in the office
constantly." At about $8 a day, it's also cheaper than a receptionist.
But Tully says the potential loss of revenue from missed calls
far outweighs the subscription cost. "There's really nothing
to compare it to," he says.

Wildfire already has generated a lot of interest. In the past
year, more than 60,000 callers have heard a demonstration of
the service by calling the company's "800-Wildfire" demo line.
The company expects to have service bureaus in the 10 largest
metropolitan areas by the second quarter of 1996, with national
coverage and several thousand users by year's end. Cellular
providers AT&T and Pacific Bell will integrate the technology
into their service in 1997, and Wildfire is in discussions
with other carriers.

What's next? How about networking Wildfire servers together
and letting multiple Wildfire Assistants schedule and set up
conference calls? In the future, Wildfire will handle all communications,
including E-mail and faxes. Someday, you may even be able to
program your assistant by dialing in through the World Wide
Web.

Further down the line, Wildfire may provide assistance at home
monitoring the baby's room, turning off the oven, or telling
the temperature outside. Or you may use Wildfire in your car.
But Wildfire isn't for everything- when it comes to voice recognition
for television remote controls, d'Arbeloff believes the thumb
is faster. But in other cases, once someone's gotten used to
Wildfire, it's hard to let go. Says Saffo, "It already seems
like a foreign idea for me to take a phone call without first
knowing who's on the other end."

Paging Systems: New Wireless -- As paging technologies evolve, companies gain
low-cost ways to deliver information to mobile workers

By:
Jill Gambon

Skytel Corp. was ahead of its rivals when it rolled out the
first two-way paging service last September. But the company
can expect plenty of competition this year as several companies
introduce their own two-way paging and voice messaging services
on the much-hyped narrowband Personal Communications Services
(PCS) networks, thus bringing anytime, anywhere communication
a step closer to reality.

As those PCS networks come on line, paging products, long derided
as low-tech gadgets, are starting to gain respect and win over
corporate users. PCS networks operate at higher radio frequencies
than cellular and use twice as much radio spectrum as one-way
paging. They offer two-way messaging, voice, and even full
data transfer services. As the technology evolves, companies
envision pagers becoming a low-cost alternative for delivering
key business information to mobile workers.

The information systems department at Global Marine Inc., an
offshore drilling contractor in Houston, has been using SkyTel
2-Way for several months to keep LAN technicians in contact
with the help desk. SkyTel's service lets technicians answer
messages with preprogrammed replies like "stuck in traffic"
or "I'll call in 15 minutes." They can also send an up-to-500
character E-mail message by connecting the device to a Hewlett
Packard palmtop computer.

Constant Contact

Global Marine technicians, who roam among three buildings, no
longer have to find a phone to answer a page. "What I like
is the response capability," says Gary Garrison, the company's
telecommunications manager. "If you're in a meeting, you can
deal with a problem without having to get up and use the phone."

It is precisely this ability to stay in constant contact and
easily exchange information that SkyTel and its rivals hope
will drive demand for their services. SkyTel and others have
invested heavily in building PCS networks. SkyTel got a head
start when it won a Pioneer Preference award from the FCC in
1991 to develop the first two-way messaging service. Since
then, 10 companies-including SkyTel-have paid more than $617
million for the nationwide narrowband PCS licenses the FCC
auctioned in July 1994.

The rollout of two-way paging and voice messaging comes at a
time when paging's popularity is at an all-time high. Some
34 million Americans carry pagers, up from 27.3 million last
year, according to Dorothy Salmon, a paging analyst with MTA
EMCI, a telecommunications consulting firm in Washington. Salmon
expects demand to grow by 25% to 30% a year during the next
few years.

Some companies already use one-way paging networks to deliver
limited amounts of information. The New England Medical Center
in Boston uses software from Data Critical Corp. of Redmond,
Wash., to transmit EKG files to doctors over one-way paging
networks.

The advent of two-way messaging should increase the capacity
for sending and requesting information, permitting bigger,
more complex files to be exchanged, says Craig Kairis, VP of
business development for Data Critical. "There's more bandwidth,
so we will be able to do more faster," he says. Particularly
promising is the potential for PCS networks to access and query
the corporate database, Kairis adds.

Trials In The Offing

With the network infrastructure nearly built, many carriers
are getting ready to roll out trials. Sometime in the first
quarter, Paging Network Inc. (PageNet) in Plano, Texas, will
begin testing its voice-messaging service in San Francisco,
Dallas, and New York over its PCS network. Dubbed VoiceNow,
the service promises to transform a pager into a pocket-sized
answering machine for about $20 a month. PageNet subscribers
will listen to digital voice messages by holding a pager to
their ear. By mid-year, PageNet plans to launch trials of a
two-way data messaging service in Atlanta. Like SkyTel, PageNet's
service will let subscribers send pre-programmed messages or
reply to a page by selecting from a menu of responses. By 1997,
the company expects to offer more robust data transfer, like
sending spreadsheets over its PCS network.

PageMart in Dallas also plans to launch trials of its voice
messaging and two-way paging service this year. The company
expects subscribers will eventually use the data service to
conduct transactions such as airline and hotel reservations
or to order theater tickets. PageMart is aggressively courting
software makers to integrate wireless messaging with enterprise
applications such as E-mail.

"The [PCS] spectrum is considered a wide-open frontier. The
software will give it its personality," a PageMart spokeswoman
says. To prime the pump, the company released a software developer's
kit last June. PageMart is working with the software companies
to target vertical markets like field service and field sales.

AirTouch Communications of Dallas also is developing a two-way
messaging service that is expected to debut this year. Another
supplier, PCS Development Corp. of Greenville, S.C., is expected
to begin trials of a voice messaging service over its two-way
network in Atlanta in the first quarter and in Boston in the
second quarter. The company expects to have nationwide voice
messaging and two-way data messaging by 1997.

The investment community is also getting involved. In November,
PCS Development announced it raised $55.5 million in a private
equity offering, the largest venture-backed private equity
financing in 1995, according to Securities Data Corp., a Newark,
N.J. research firm.

For its part, SkyTel is improving its pager's design and better
integrating its network with enterprise applications such as
database querying. The company is readying beta versions of
its software developers kit and is upgrading the pager with
pen input capabilities to make it easier to generate messages,
says Doug Brackbill, SkyTel's senior VP of advanced applications.

Some envision the day when pagers equipped with infrared ports
will enable wireless file transfer between pager and PC. Updated
spreadsheets or word processing documents sent to a pager could
be transferred via infrared to a laptop or PC for viewing or
printing. Notebook makers are expected to build two-way paging
capabilities into their machines, eliminating the need to connect
the pager to the notebook to transfer files. "It's so obvious
that two-way paging should be built into notebooks," says Ira
Brodsky, president of Datacomm Research in Wilmette, Ill. "A
lot of the voicemail phone tag and hunting for phones would
be avoided."

Motorola, developer of the Reflex two-way paging protocol, has
licensed its technology to Texas Instrument's semiconductor
division, so notebooks with two-way paging capabilities could
be on the market by year's end, says Larry Conlee, corporate
VP and director of worldwide markets for Motorola's advanced
messaging systems division. Brodsky also expects paging capabilities
will soon be better integrated into personal digital assistants,
creating a market for information services like traffic updates
and travel and entertainment reports to be delivered over PCS
networks.

One looming issue, however, is dueling standards. While many
paging companies are basing their systems on Reflex, AT&T has
developed a TCP/IP standard, known as Pact (Personal Air Communications
Technology). "The fact that AT&T would invest energy and time
to come up with their own standards underscores how important
this market is," says Motorola's Conlee.

Interactive System: Media Circus -- More apps, low prices draw business to 
multimedia tent 

By:
Mary Hayes

For consumers, the definition of multi-media is easy: cool PC
games, CD-ROM videos, and CD-quality music played on a PC or
Macintosh. But business and technology managers are still struggling
to define multimedia and what multimedia technologies mean
to their enterprises. To many technology managers, "multimedia"
is a code word for flashy, yet unnecessary, devices and applications
that are too pricey to be truly useful.

Business attitudes about multimedia should begin to change in
1996. Advances in technology and lower costs will help business
PCs evolve from tools that create and manipulate static, text
based information to integrated communications systems that
incorporate sound and movement while encouraging user interaction.
More businesses will begin to use desktop videoconferencing,
computer-based training, interactive catalogs, and other multimedia
applications.

"It's important for the information technology community to
think outside the box," advises Philip Dodds, president of
the Interactive Multimedia Association, a trade group in Annapolis,
Md. "Multimedia applications will develop from areas we're
not even thinking about-things we haven't used a computer for
before." That's why, in Dodds' view, businesses need to become
more creative in encouraging the daily use of PCs.

Several factors will help drive multimedia into mainstream corporate
America. The vendor community is working hard to improve such
still-immature technologies as video compression. More software
and hardware companies are banding together and promoting open
multimedia standards. Systems manufacturers are building more
systems pre-loaded with multimedia hardware, obviating the
need to spend corporate dollars for add-on software.

But perhaps the biggest force in multimedia in business is the
declining price of systems that have sufficient computing power
to run multimedia applications. Pentium-based PCs were selling
early in 1995 at an average of $2,200; by early 1996 they will
be priced at least $500 lower. That's important, because while
most businesses use a version of Microsoft Windows on the desktop,
most multimedia Windows applications don't work well on PCs
that run on microprocessor platforms less powerful than Pentiums.

Price wars broke out among makers of Pentium-based systems in
the last quarter of 1995 and are expected to continue into
1996. Intel, which produces the Pentium chip, says it will
cut prices again on Feb. 1, which should continue to fuel system
price drops.

Also, computer manufacturers now build systems with multimedia
in mind. For example, in October IBM unveiled its PC Series
Model 330 containing a 75-MHz Pentium microprocessor with 8
Mbytes of RAM and a 540-Mbyte hard drive for $1,660-just a
few hundred dollars more than a powerful 486 PC system. That
Pentium PC ships with 2 Mbytes of video RAM and a CD-ROM drive.

Hugh Hendrick, IS manager for the City of San Mateo, Calif.,notes
that even budget-crunched municipalities are now buying Pentiums.
"Most new systems we're buying are Pentiums," says Hendrick.
"They're so cheap." But how many of these Pentium PCs include
multimedia? That depends on the cost of add-on hardware, says
Hendrick. "As these features become more common and you see
more bundles, people will get more motivated," he adds.

Growing Trend

Several manufacturers already have announced multimedia bundling
a trend that should grow in 1996. Tatung Co. of America Inc.
in Long Beach, Calif., recently rolled out the Uniq 5510, a
100-MHz Pentium PC with Super Graphics Video Array (SVGA),
a Creative Labs sound card, a CD-ROM drive, 16 Mbytes of RAM,
2 Mbytes of video RAM, a 540-Mbyte hard drive, and a software
utility that sets resolution and color depth. Total price:
$2,688.

In December, Sigma Designs Inc. in Fremont, Calif., announced
a deal with Zenon Technology Inc. to pre-install Sigma MPEG
accelerator cards in Zenon's Pentium systems. Because it includes
standard Motion Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) video-compression
technology, Zenon's $2,000, 75-MHz Pentium Interactive MPEG
system (which comes with 16 Mbytes of RAM, a 1-Gbyte hard drive,
and quad-speed CD-ROM drive) can process TV-quality video and
CD-quality sound without add-on cards.

Some vendors are bundling multimedia hardware and software.
Compaq says it will ship PCs with ProShare, Intel's desktop
video- and teleconferencing software, by late 1997. The two
companies say they need nearly two years to figure out how
best to bundle conferencing and keep systems costs low.

Several manufacturers are jointly developing open standards
for multimedia technology. One of the most important is the
adoption of the MPEG video-compression standard, which is being
pushed by the MPEG consortium, a group sanctioned by the International
Standards Organization in Paris. MPEG helps networked systems
move large video images more easily and eliminates the jerky,
unpolished look of video that runs on PCs. The more vendors
that adopt MPEG technology, the lower the cost and the more
compatible various systems will become.

Microsoft's Windows 95 desktop operating system is expected
to gain MPEG support this year. But industry observers note
one major problem with MPEG software: It requires that the
microprocessor do most of the work, making the technology suitable
only for high-end Pentium machines. Thus, the adoption of MPEG
software rests on the affordability of those systems.

But MPEG's real growth will come from corporate acceptance of
videoconferencing."These systems are almost as common as a
copy machine for global companies," notes Dusty Sykes, a consultant
at Vanguard Communications in Morris Plains, N.J.

Eric Goldreich, IS manager at law firm Sheppard, Mullen, Richter
& Hampton in Los Angeles, plans to purchase a Concord videoconferencing
system from PictureTel Corp. in Danvers, Mass., early in 1996.
Notes Goldreich, "If I have just 10 lawyers who don't have
to fly from San Francisco to L.A. for a meeting every month,
the system pays for itself." The cost of operating Concord
about $2,800 a month-is "less than it was a few years ago,"
says Goldreich.

In 1996, businesses can expect more portable conferencing systems
at more affordable prices. Analysts predict systems makers
will start to market PC notebooks with color LCD screens, high
quality sound, and CD-ROM drives in the $2,000 price range.
Improved video on portable systems may affect how some sales
and marketing professionals work. Soon, business will experiment
with video presentations or videoconferences on the road.

After all, as more workers install multimedia Pentium or PowerPC
machines at home, the more they'll come to expect the power
and glitz of multimedia at work.

Visual Tools: Constructing Better Visuals -- Low-end visual development tools
will use new operating systems to offer high-end features

By:
Sean Gallagher

Once upon a time, visual development tools could be categorized
easily. At the low end were tools like Microsoft's Visual Basic
and Powersoft Corp.'s PowerBuilder. Developers could use these
products to quickly build desktop applications or front ends
for databases, but such products lacked management tools and
facilities for large team development. At the high end, tools
such as Forte from Forte Software Inc. and Dynasty from Dynasty
Technologies Inc., could build three-tier applications and
had the enterprise architecture that the low-end tools lacked,
but carried a hefty price tag.

But 1996 will see those class distinctions fade away as the
low-end tools of yesterday gain many of the features of enterprise
class development tools. New releases of PowerBuilder, Visual
Basic, Borland International Inc.'s Delphi, and Gupta Corp.'s
Centura-a 32-bit successor to SQLWindows-will ship this year,
putting new power into the hands of Windows developers for
a fraction of the price of their heavyweight cousins.

Two major new technologies will push these tools into the world
of full-scale enterprise development: standard object models
for both the desktop and distributed environments, and structured
methodologies for building large-scale applications. At the
same time, built-in compilers will make the performance of
these tools closer to that of third-generation languages (3GLs)
like C++

Visual tools are coming of age partly because operating systems
are finally up to the task. Visual Basic 4.0 and the upcoming
32-bit releases of Delphi version 2.0, PowerBuilder 5.0, and
Centura will run as native applications on Microsoft's Windows
95 and Windows NT operating systems. Besides being more stable
than Windows 3.1, these operating systems offer an object model
for applications to interact with-Microsoft's OLE 2.0 object
technology.

OLE controls (OCXs) are now the standard components for assembling
Visual Basic applications. Since all the development tools
being written to the Windows 95 standard will be able to use
OCXs, the OCX market is likely to explode this year, giving
applications everything from database access controls to built
in Internet functionality.

The OLE object model also turns OLE 2.0-compliant software-including
applications written in Visual Basic 4.0 and the upcoming visual
tools-into components that can be embedded in or linked to
other OLE 2.0 applications. This level of application integration
comes at a price: Many developers consider OLE too big and
too slow. But it opens a number of possibilities to users of
visual tools, including a means to partition client-server
applications.

Distributed OLE

The first visual tool to take full advantage of OLE 2.0 was
Microsoft's Visual Basic 4.0, introduced in September. The
centerpiece of Visual Basic 4.0 is its remote automation object
technology, based on Microsoft's distributed extension of the
OLE object model. This technology will be released separately
in 1996 as Network OLE.

The distributed extension to the OLE standard supports communications
between applications and objects across a network as though
they were running on the same machine. OLE automation objects
thus become server applications, pushing visual tools into
the realm of multitier client-server development.

Three-tier client-server applications are partitioned into client
and multiple server components to ease management headaches
and to increase performance. Most of the business logic computing
is handled by a shared object running on an application server,
while the client is reduced to handling little more than how
the data is entered and displayed.

Network OLE will make communications between application server
objects and client front ends part of the same interprocess
communications structure that handles communications between
Windows applications on the same computer. Network OLE will
use an established technology to do this: remote procedure
calls (RPCs)

Gupta's SQLWindows and other visual development tools have had
the capability to pass RPCs for some time, but they often require
coding in C or C++ to fully exploit RPCs. Network OLE wraps
RPCs in an easily digestible form, removing much of the pain
of developing with it.

So far, only Visual Basic leverages this technology directly.
But other visual tools can use Visual Basic as network plumbing
by acting as remote automation objects for Visual Basic applications.
Once Microsoft makes distributed OLE part of its operating
system, any OLE-supporting tool will be able to hook into Network
OLE.

Microsoft also is teaming with Software AG to port OLE integration
to Unix, VMS, and MVS systems. But some vital elements are
missing from Microsoft's object model-for one, it lacks a tool,
such as an object broker or an object repository, to manage
the networked objects.

Visual Basic also lacks a built-in methodology for designing
code, and despite its new version-control capabilities, it
still strikes high-end developers as too undisciplined in its
framework for large-scale development. Also, because Visual
Basic uses a run-time interpreter rather than compiled binary
code to run its applications, it suffers a performance hit
that is worsened by OLE 2.0's sluggishness.

The next release of Visual Basic will address some of these
issues by adding a compiler. In addition, Microsoft will initiate
a partner program for third-party developers of management,
computer-aided software engineering (CASE), and distributed
tools.

Delphi was touted by Borland during its initial development
as a Visual Basic killer. While it hasn't swept Visual Basic
from the field, Delphi has won over many Microsoft customers
and established a niche for building fast, tight, desktop database
centric applications.

What made Delphi hot in 1995 will make it hotter in 1996. It
manages to balance the flexibility and power of an object-oriented
programming language with the speed of a rapid applications
development tool, and it has strong database integration features.

But Delphi has also grown into something more. The next release
of Delphi-version 2.0-will take further advantage of its Object
Pascal language's 3GL roots in the 32-bit realm and leapfrog
many of the enterprise features of Visual Basic. There will
be three versions of the tool: Delphi Desktop for individual
developers, Delphi Developer for professional LAN-based developers,
and Delphi Client/Server Suite for client-server developers.

The developer and client-server versions will include both development
management tools often associated with the high end of the
applications development market: an object repository for sharing
reusable forms and other objects, a data dictionary for standardized
data types, direct support for Intersolv's PVCS version-control
software, and a source-code library of visual controls.

Another new feature incorporated into the two high-end versions
of Delphi will be the Open Tools API, an applications programming
interface that's designed for integrating Delphi with CASE
tools, version-control systems, and third-party experts (as
Borland calls its automated helpers). The client-server edition
also will include tools specific to the world of two-tier development.
One of these is SQL Explorer, which allows developers to browse
and edit the configuration of domains, triggers, and stored
procedures on any supported database server.

But when it comes to three-tier computing, Borland has decided
to let others manage the details. The Scotts Valley, Calif.,
company has not implemented its own application partitioning
architecture; instead, it will exploit Microsoft's Network
OLE for three-tier client-server applications.

Three Platforms

Powersoft's PowerBuilder 5.0, which will ship before the summer,
adds both application partitioning and the capability to compile
code. PowerBuilder also brings with it the best inherent cross
platform capabilities-it's the only visual tool of the four
that can deploy applications on Unix and the Macintosh, as
well as on Windows.

At the same time, PowerBuilder's limitations fall somewhere
between Visual Basic's and Delphi's-it is neither as flexible
as Delphi nor as easy to use as Visual Basic. This will change
with its upcoming support of Microsoft's OLE 2.0 and OCX standards
and its growing library of objects.

Powersoft, rather than rely on Microsoft to provide the plumbing
for three-tier applications, is building its own multiplatform
model for distributed objects. Within PowerBuilder 5.0, developers
will be able to deploy PowerBuilder objects on Windows NT,
Unix, or Macintosh and use Powersoft's own object request broker
to establish communications between applications and distributed
objects. Powersoft's Practical Application Partitioning strategy,
which revolves around its object request broker, will let PowerBuilder
developers move objects to application servers, compile them
as executable programs on the server platform, and manage connections
between applications and objects through a transport object
running on a designated server. While this method of object
brokering is proprietary, the Concord, Mass., company has designed
its architecture to plug into a standard Common Object Request
Broker Architecture (Corba) system in the future.

PowerBuilder 5.0 will compile to native binary code by first
generating C code, then passing that code behind the scenes
to the Watcom 32-bit C compiler. While this will give PowerBuilder
applications better performance, developers won't be able to
access or modify the generated C code to tune or debug it.
Gupta isn't moving its SQLWindows platform to the 32-bit environment.
Instead, the Menlo Park, Calif., company is rewriting its 16
bit product, creating a completely new underlying architecture.
Gupta is hedging its bets in some ways. The company will continue
to offer its 16-bit SQLWindows 5.0 product for two-tier client
server development and will incorporate many Centura features.

Centura will be positioned as a higher-end product than SQLWindows,
with Gupta's sights set on competing in the same arena as Forte
and Dynasty. In December, Gupta announced a partnership with
Open Environment Corp. of Boston to produce a three-tier technology
for its SQLWindows and Centura products. The three-tier product,
called QuickRPC, will let Gupta applications use Open Environment's
three-tier and Distributed Computing Environment application
architectures. Gupta also will provide connections between
its development tools and transaction processing monitors such
as Novell's Tuxedo. To automate the partitioning of Centura
applications, Gupta will provide a three-tier wizard, similar
to the wizards in Microsoft's desktop applications.

Centura will include an open object repository and data modeling
and source code management capabilities. Gupta is teaming with
Rational Software Corp. to incorporate Rational's Rose CASE
tool into the 32-bit product, and is building on the team development
technologies of Gupta's TeamWindows product.

The Centura language, like SQLWindows, will be fully object
oriented. Gupta will expand its current partial compilation
to compile all object code into dynamically linked libraries,
and users will be able to build fully compiled OCXs-none of
the other tools currently does this.

As these once low-end tools push into three-tier computing,
they may make good on some long unfulfilled promises from structured
tools-and at a lower price.

Programming Languages: Java Makes The Web Perform -- Sun's fledgling 
programming language for the Internet is drawing a crowd of client-server
software developers

By:
Jason Levitt

Imagine if the cost of maintaining client software on your corporate
desktops were reduced to a fraction of its current level. What
if your networked applications automatically came in versions
for Windows, Macintosh, and X Window? Perhaps you'd like to
run your client application no matter where you were or what
machine you happened to be using.

This could be the near future of client-server software on the
Internet if Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java programming language
achieves its potential. Not bad for a product that was originally
developed as an embedded language for consumer appliances and
was virtually unknown a year ago. But with an Internet-crazy
industry hungry for adding portability, two-way interactivity,
and flexible content to the rather static pages of the World
Wide Web, Java is the right technology at the right time.

Java (it's not an acronym; the name was chosen to convey a sense
of liveliness and interactivity) owes much of its notoriety
to Netscape Communications Corp., whose decision to license
the Java run-time interpreter for inclusion in Navigator 2.0,
the most widely used Web browser, created enthusiasm among
developers. Although there are no shipping commercial applications
based on Java, or even a release version of the software development
kit for creating such applications, companies such as Applix,
Eastman Kodak, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, and Starfish (headed by
ex-Borland International chairman Philippe Kahn) are all aggressively
pursuing Java software development and integration with their
existing products. Additionally, such companies as Borland,
IBM, Macromedia, Metrowerks, Microsoft, Netscape, Oracle, Silicon
Graphics, and Spyglass have licensed source code for the Java
run-time interpreter so they can create clients capable of
executing Java applets, applications written in a subset of
the Java language designed for use in Web pages. Individuals
and small developers are also making their presence known by
posting their Java applets on Sun's main Java Internet site
(http://java.sun.com)

Portability and security-both at the top of the information
systems manager's most wanted list-were important considerations
in Java's development.

Java applets are highly portable, reducing both maintenance
and time-to-market for multiplatform applications. Developers
need to write the application only once. A single compiled
applet will run identically on any platform that has a Java
enabled browser.

Java applet portability is accomplished through the Java run
time execution environment and the class libraries used for
applet programming, which isolate the applets from architecture
specific knowledge of the execution platform. For example,
applets don't know if the screen they're writing to is managed
by Windows or MacOS; they simply write to a display object
that has generic screen attributes. Although generic objects
limit the developer's ability to access platform-specific features
(such as advanced screen drawing on the Macintosh), using generic
objects increases portability. To support a new platform, only
the Java run-time execution environment needs to be ported
to the new platform.

Java is an interpreted language. But unlike most interpreted
languages, which are executed directly from source code, Java
applets are compiled into an architecture-neutral bytecode
format, which is smaller and more efficient to interpret than
source code. Once compiled, the applets sit on the Web server
waiting for a Java-enabled browser to download them. When the
applets are downloaded to the browser, the run-time interpreter
inside the browser executes the applet code.

To quell the security concerns of users, Sun has placed limits
and controls on the resources available to applets. For example,
an applet is permitted to establish network connections only
with its originating host, and it cannot create new processes.
Local file system access is very limited, but there is no agreement
among browser vendors on how to restrict file system access.
Sun's HotJava browser uses Access Control Lists to limit file
system access, while Netscape's Navigator 2.0, which is still
in beta, allows no access at all. Kim Polese, marketing manager
for Java, concedes that Sun has not reached an agreement with
Netscape on security implementation details. "We're working
with Netscape [and the other Java licensees] to have more browser
consistency with the security options that are available,"
Polese says.

Java-enabled browsers assume that any applet is untrusted, and
so they first pass the applet through the Java Bytecode Verifier
to ensure that it doesn't violate any security rules. They
then run the the Java Class Loader to verify that the applet
doesn't try to spoof an existing class or otherwise try to
extend the applet in a bogus manner.

Unfortunately, simply specifying these two security mechanisms
isn't satisfying potential Java users. Companies need assurances
that all Java-enabled browsers will faithfully adhere to the
security measures. So to further placate Java security worriers,
Sun has instituted a Java-compatible logo, which is enforced
contractually with the licensees of the Java run-time interpreter.
Products from licensees must pass a test suite to ensure that
all applets will run with everyone's interpreters, and interpreters
will faithfully enforce security precautions.

What's Brewing

While it appears that many developers are taking a wait-and
see attitude toward Java, some, such as Applix in Westboro,
Mass., are jumping in quickly. Applix, known for its ApplixWare
office productivity tools for Unix and Windows NT-including
integrated spreadsheet, E-mail, graphics, and real-time data
collection tools-claims to have developed the first Java-based
client-server spreadsheet.

Applix took the spreadsheet component of ApplixWare, which is
not a client-server application, and rewrote the user interface
portion in Java, using Java's network communications abilities
so that a client could communicate with the spreadsheet, which
would be maintained and updated on a server. The calculation
and data-access engines were left on the server to keep the
client side simple. The Java-based spreadsheet looks very much
like the ApplixWare spreadsheet, but the Java version can run
on any platform that has a Java-enabled browser.

An additional benefit of this Java-based ApplixWare component
is simplified network updates of the application. Since Java
applets are downloaded from the server before executing on
the client, updates can be made by simply updating the components
on the server. No intervention on the client side is necessary;
when the client executes the applet, the current version is
automatically downloaded from the server.

"We have a range of customers who are interested in this network
centric computing model where there is very little client-side
maintenance," says Mark Yohai, director of Internet applications
for Applix. Yohai expects to offer a demo version of Applix's
spreadsheet applet soon from its Web site (http://www.applix.com
) though he was unable to say when the product will be released.

Starfish is making a Java applet out of the group-scheduling
component of its popular Sidekick networked contacts manager.
The result will be that wide area, multiplatform, group scheduling
is easily accomplished via the Internet. Then, even people
without Sidekick can participate in group scheduling by downloading
the applet and executing it in their Java-enabled Web browser.

"The big problem with workgroup products in the past," says
Starfish CEO Kahn, "is that you had to have the client program
to participate, but the problem is that participants don't
always have the client program."

Though both Starfish and Applix have offered convincing demos,
users have yet to see any serious applications hit the market,
despite the excitement over Java technology. Part of the problem
is that most Java development tools are still crude. Some significant
development tools have been announced, however.

Symantec is offering Java support in Expresso, an add-on tool
to its C++ development environment. Borland says it will deliver
Latte technology, a visual programming environment for Java,
in several stages, with the first commercial release scheduled
to ship by June.

Also, Natural Intelligence Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. expects
to ship its Applet Development Kit for the Macintosh, code
named Roaster, in January. Roaster will include a Java compiler
and an applet testing environment. Sun also expects its Java
software development kit for Windows 95 and NT and Solaris
to ship in January, with Sun's Macintosh development kit going
into beta about the same time.

Too Attractive To Ignore

With applications still to be delivered and nagging concerns
about security, Java has yet to prove itself. Nevertheless,
the speed at which the technology is being adopted, coupled
with the promise of greatly reduced costs, are proving too
attractive to ignore.

Java has no real competitors at the moment. But when Microsoft's
Internet publishing system becomes generally available in the
first quarter of 1996, it will offer an alternate-though not
necessarily an incompatible-development choice. Microsoft has
announced it will add Java run-time support to its Internet
Explorer browser, though there is no indication that Microsoft
will add Java support to its Internet Studio design tool.

Microsoft's strategy may have a number of advantages initially,
mainly the ability to share downloaded OLE Controls (OCXs)
with OLE-enabled applications on PCs. But unlike Java applets,
OCXs are platform-specific, which puts a greater burden on
the developer to provide versions of OCXs for each client platform.

Sun has already published on its Web site pertinent APIs and
specifications for both the Java language and the run-time
execution environment. According to Sun's Polese, these specs
allow developers to write Java interpreters or language implementations,
therefore calming fears that Sun will be the sole source of
Java technology.

New tools, such as the Expresso Grinder compiler (http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de
~espresso), developed by Martin Odersky, a professor at the
University of Karlsruhe, Germany, that claims to translate
Java programs into Java bytecode format much faster than the
compiler supplied by Sun, are proof that at least some of the
specs are usable.

Hot Skills In '96 -- Internet, client-server, and networking
experts top lists of the most wanted



The hot talent in information systems in 1996 will be people
who know the Internet, client-server computing, or networking,
hiring executives say. Nudged out of the spotlight but still
much in demand will be SAP R/3 and Lotus Notes experts.

The fortunate ones with the coveted skills may not only find
it easier to land a job but could also wangle a higher salary.
Plus, IS people with strong business ability could be in demand
for new hybrid posts.

It's no surprise that the hottest area in computers-the Internet
is creating demand for Internet skills. The supply isn't expected
to match the demand.

"IS organizations are looking for people experienced in working
with the Internet, particularly regarding security issues and
building firewalls," says Vic Janulaitis, CEO of Positive Support
Review, an IS consulting firm in Santa Monica, Calif. Other
Internet skills in demand include familiarity with tools for
creating splashy Internet products.

In the client-server arena, expertise in C++ programming still
will be in heavy demand. But so will dexterity with other development
languages and object programming tools.

Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc. in Dallas, which is migrating from mainframe
to client-server computing, is seeking expertise in Visual
Basic, Forte, and Oracle software, says Trey Bradley, chief
information officer. He hopes to upgrade the skills of the
existing staff, but will look outside for hard-to-find people
like Forte developers.

Meanwhile, Greg Scileppi, executive director of RHI Consulting,
the Menlo Park, Calif., technical services arm of job-placement
firm Robert Half International, says he is getting heavy requests
for workers with client-server skills such as expertise in
front-end graphical user interfaces, relational databases,
and help-desk support.

Other IS organizations are looking for expertise in older software
on new platforms-for example, IBM DB2 database software on
Windows NT.

State Street Bank of Boston is searching for "networking expertise
that runs the gamut, including peer-to-peer networking," says
CIO David Sexton.

Job experts say it isn't unusual for a programmer who would
otherwise be paid $50,000 to $60,000 a year to see an extra
$10,000 to $20,000 tacked on for rare skills.

Pat Roberts, president of Professional Training Services Inc.
in King of Prussia, Pa., says some of her large corporate clients
are creating roles for people with "exceptional business, operational,
and technical understanding."

Some companies are appointing liaisons between business units
and the IS organization. Roberts says these posts are often
filled by someone with "good people and business skills" from
the IS organization, or someone with solid technical skills
from the business unit.

The Secret CIO: What's Hot Versus What's Not -- 1996 promises hype, chic 
trends, and maybe even some really useful tools

By:
Herbert W. Lovelace

Even if you are not paying attention to the calendar, it is
still easy to notice when the end of a year is reached. Forget
the traditional indicators: holiday parties and general ledger
system problems. The new year is signaled by magazines' guesses
about what the next 12 months will bring. Reading these predictions
takes your mind off of worrying whether you held down December
spending enough to avoid blowing the annual systems budget.

It would be fascinating if the magazines also wrote about how
accurate their past projections have been. For instance, whatever
happened to CASE and expert systems? And how many times can
you read about the coming of asynchronous transfer mode? You
get the idea.

Another approach would be to compare Chic Hot with Actual Hot.
Chic Hot is what we talk about when we go to meetings with
other chief information officers. Actual Hot is what we're
really doing. In 1995, reengineering and data warehousing were
Chic Hot. If we changed a system to combine two reports we
called it reengineering, and any use of existing information
was called data warehousing.

In 1996, reengineering and data warehousing should continue
as strong contenders in the Chic Hot category. Joining them
will be objects and the ever-popular Windows 95-which will
probably win the Lovelace Verbiage Ratio Award. The LVRA goes
to that product with the highest ratio of printed word to corporate
use. With the exception of Dow Chemical rolling out Win95 and
Ford doing what they call a test (on more machines than most
of us possess), the consensus of my friends has been that it's
not ready for prime time, but will still garner as much media
fervor as the O.J. Simpson trial.

Actual Hot is more difficult to predict, but it is clear that
SAP's R/3 software will continue to gain momentum. If you haven't
yet considered it, take a look; your boss will expect you to
be able to explain why it is, or is not, good for your company.
Lack of familiarity with R/3 could be a career-limiting move.

Crawling Fruit

The Internet hype will start to bear fruit as businesspeople
look for ways to move knowledge of their products onto the
Net and gain an edge on their competition. The entire class
of tools that addresses Internet security will be big. Bad
things can happen to good people without proper firewalls and
carefully considered security plans. Java, one true application
of object technology, should be really hot. Java, if you have
not had a chance to investigate it, is a programming language
that, among other things, can embed animation into HTML pages.

Finally, World Wide Web spiders and people who know how to use
them will become big late next year. A spider, which is a program
such as Lycos that goes out on the Net to find the information
you want, is essential to using the Net intelligently. MetaCrawler,
which automatically searches other spiders, is really interesting,
although it opens all sorts of ownership and other legal issues.

Hope you had a happy New Year. Cindy and I relaxed in front
of the fireplace, and I did not even dwell on Kratmeyer's request
that we install a Win95 data warehouse in International Operations
to support his reengineering effort. I wish he would stop reading
airline magazines.

Desktop Agenda: The Parts Bill Left Out -- Microsoft bugs help exhume deleted
material from The Road Ahead

By:
Stephen Manes

Everybody's making predictions, so here's mine: History will
rank Bill Gates as an author right up there with one of his
personal favorites-Robert James Waller, the man who wrote The
Bridges Of Madison County. No one with a heart could possibly
remain unmoved at the poignant images in Bill's book The Road
Ahead (Viking, 1995). I almost shed a tear as I read this:
"Stallion, she thought, as his fingers eagerly caressed both
buttons of her Microsoft mouse. Stallion, she knew, as all
at once he manfully manipulated the Control, Alt, and Delete
keys of her Microsoft Natural Keyboard."

Actually, that passage didn't make it into the book. But as
I reported in The New York Times, security lapses in Microsoft's
OLE object technology make Office files suck up deleted data
from your hard drive unless you're using Windows NT (Microsoft
issued a fix for the problem on Dec. 6). Besides, when you
use the "fast save" option with Microsoft Word, your deletions
stay in the file.

I predict that thanks to these amazing "features," sources may
soon treat us to portions of the book that were deleted before
it reached the presses. Before you curse Microsoft for causing
your deleted rants to reappear in E-mail messages you've sent
across the Net, give thanks that its incompetence may have
kept alive the parts of Bill's book that he left out.

In the book itself, for example, Gates is stingy with credit.
His fellow billionaire Paul Allen receives his due for helping
develop the original Microsoft Basic, but the "third man" on
that project, programmer Monte Davidoff, isn't mentioned. The
Parts Left Out will reveal that Gates actually cited everyone
whose work he borrowed, but the bibliography was mysteriously
omitted at the last moment.

The book explains some of the electronic novelties of the huge
house Gates is building, such as pictures and music that can
follow guests around like an obsequious puppy. The Parts Left
Out will disclose the shocking news that although most of the
house's systems are based on Windows NT, the windows themselves
will be controlled by a variant of IBM's OS/2 system that did
so well with airport baggage in Denver.

Shirts And Suits

In The Road Ahead, Gates writes that "Soon there will be computerized
shirt-making machines that will obey a different set of instructions
for every shirt ... It is conceivable that within a few years
everyone will have measurements registered electronically so
it will be easy to find out how well a ready-made item will
fit, or to place a custom order." The Parts Left Out will reveal
that every article of clothing Gates has worn since 1991 was
produced by a top-secret Microsoft system that also cuts and
styles his hair.

The book discusses a "full bodysuit" that can reproduce tactile
sensations. The Parts Left Out will disclose that Microsoft
has had a prototype under development for years. Programmers
who volunteered for the project will declare they have experienced
bliss-for the first time in their lives.

Gates writes that he thinks of a "wallet PC" as a "new Swiss
Army knife" that will serve as "a camera, a pocket tape recorder,
a cellular phone, a pager, concert tickets, a map, a compass,
a calculator," and "perhaps a loud whistle to summon help."
The Parts Left Out will show that the only part of the prototype
that works is the whistle, though breakthroughs are expected
in nail-file and scissors technology.

An Industry (Touchstone/Simon and Schuster)

Object Technology: Make Software Fit Business -- Business software should be 
designed to help users do their jobs-not dictate their actions

By:
Robert Morison

The Internet is dramatically changing our view of information
access. As Net users, we are learning to find the information
we want, or even suspect exists, using generic tools. This
information-centric model is gathering momentum as we enter
the new year.

Yet most corporate information systems aren't built to participate
in the flow of new information, or to capitalize on the creativity
unleashed by it. As corporations, we're still tied to the predetermined
data regurgitated by cumbersome applications whose design centers
are actually automation, not information.

This situation cannot continue; the business world is changing
too fast. The purpose of business software is overdue for radical
rethinking. To date, software has been used to organize information
to automate processes. Instead, software should organize information
for communication and understanding, creating a model of the
business that can be used in many ways. Implementing this change
is a primary challenge for IS organizations in 1996 and beyond.

What's wrong with today's business software? Take a simple example
 a telephone call to a mail-order outfit. A typical sequence
 I'm put on hold ... I listen to canned sincerity telling me
how important my call is to them ... a representative then
asks for the customer codes on the mailing label ... I say
the catalog is in my wife's name and was sent to our former
address, and therefore does little to identify me ... I'm asked
to supply credit-card information, address, and phone number
 ... I'm finally allowed to name the item I want ... it's out
of stock.

What's going on? The rep's work has been automated. The company
designed the "best" way to handle orders, then implemented
it in software. Now, the rep is enslaved by a system that is
unfriendly to customers, demeaning to the rep's intelligence,
and ultimately unproductive.

Do your systems also impose one right way of doing things on
a variable world? Let's face it: There is no single best way
of doing anything-and there's no longer any such thing as a
stable transaction-processing system.

Ugly Complexity

The focus of business software must change to give people useful
packets of information and functionality. Software shouldn't
try to impose order; it should model the business in its ugly
complexity.

When the business changes, you use the model differently or
modify only what needs to change. Software shouldn't dictate
workers' actions; it should model their domains and respect
their intelligence in deciding how to act. That way, my mail
order rep could build an order that satisfies us both.

The technology for creating this software is, of course, object
orientation. These tools provide a natural means for organizing
software into useful packets, which is important because it
encourages business modeling. Paradoxically, the only way to
build a large, dynamic business model is bottom-up, learning
about the business and the model as you go.

These notions of software are overdue for implementation. For
years, we've been fooling ourselves that we're making progress
by dabbling in object technology and implementing option-laden
applications. But we're still reautomating.

We won't turn the corner until we change the approach. So here's
a New Year's resolution: All new software must model rather
than automate; it's the only way to cope with business change.
We must also change the intent. We shouldn't aim to "get it
right," but simply to "get it."

Technological advance-increasing processor and communications
power, multimedia, the Internet-is creating an exciting new
venue. But without redefining their software, corporations
continue playing catch against the stoop. We can't imagine
what the business world will be like when people have access
to robust business models. But it'll be different, it'll be
exciting, and companies that create models early and well will
enjoy a competitive advantage.

management.

INTERNET AND TELECOMS MERGER ANNOUNCED

Commercial Internet service provider UUNET Technologies and telecoms
carrier MFS Communications Company are to merge in a $2bn deal which
was announced on 30 April 1996. This agreement creates a combined
organisation with 50,000 business customers worldwide, served by 4,200
employees making it the most significant deal to be made public during
the prolific Internet World show at San Jose, California.

Until the announcement, UUNET Technologies, the longest-established of
the major commercial Internet access providers, had been seen primarily
as a partner of the Microsoft Corporation, but it now appears that the
company will back the link. Bill Gates, chairman and CEO of Microsoft
said: 'We are highly supportive of this merger with MFS, since the
combination of a facility-based telecoms carrier with a high quality
Internet service provider offers the potential for high bandwidth
availability at lower costs for end-users.'

Under the terms of the agreement, UUNET shares will be converted into
MFS common stock at the rate of 1 to 1.777776. The resulting $2bn (at
30 April close of market) valuation is one of the highest yet achieved
by a specialist Internet company in public flotation or merger deals.
It comes even though UUNET, like the majority of specialist Internet
service providers, has been running at an operating loss for the larger
part of its history. Once again this confirms the general performance
of the Internet-related stocks as a premium commodity to investors.

The combined company arising out of this deal will be strongly placed
to exploit the increasing synergies occurring between Internet and
traditional telecoms operations. The business will possess some 543
Internet points of presence (288 outside the US), putting it among the
best-developed Internet service operations in the world. This will be
supported by a substantial telecoms infrastructure. James Q Crowe,
chairman and CEO of MFS, in a prepared statement, indicated four major
areas of benefit to the growth of Internet-related business resulting
from the merger:

- Savings on UUNET's expenses for local communications services, which
represented over 40% of the company's network expenses.

- Combining purchasing power for international and domestic leased
circuits, thus reducing expenses.

- Improved operating margins through the collection of co-carrier
payments for dial-up Internet access.

- Improved sales performance for Internet activities.

Many commentators on the Internet have felt for some time that the
specialist Internet service providers such as UUNET, Netcom and PSI
were unlikely to prove sustainable businesses without the support of
larger parents, or full integration into existing, related
organisations.

NET FOCUS

Welcome to a new venture in Internet information publishing. Internet
for Business, published by FT Telecoms and Media Publishing, is a move
towards putting Internet-related factual information into the hands of
the business strategists and decision makers who will play a key role
in shaping the usage of these global network systems in coming years.

The Internet already attracts more column inches than perhaps any other
single area of new technology development, which is saying something
quite extraordinary given the importance of other technological fields
in modern society. Not all of this publicity has been positive, of
course, but there seems to be a wide-reaching consensus regarding the
importance of the Internet's future role in the global communications
industry. Surprisingly, the majority of readily available printed
information about the Internet focuses mainly on consumer applications
and services. Attention is given to commercial implications and
applications, but much of this coverage is hidden away in specialist
publications. It also shows an unhelpful tendency to wrap its content
in the technical mysteries and burgeoning jargon of the Internet
sector.

Internet for Business aims to change all that. The newsletter will
focus on the facts, presented as far as possible in lay terms, or with
clear explanation of technical terms and jargon. Internet for Business
will provide you with clear, unbiased and objective accounts of all
that is important in understanding the Internet sector whether
concerning new technologies, protocols and standards, typical or
outstanding business applications, company news or share performances.
For the sake of complete impartiality, coverage will be given to
commercial online services such as CompuServe and Delphi, in addition
to the Internet proper. However, it is expected that the blurring of
the boundaries between these organisations and specialist Internet
Service Providers will accelerate in 1996 and thereafter, leading to a
convergence of operation and activity across the network providers.

The Internet remains a young technology, in commercial activity at
least, and many of the companies pioneering the commercial application
of the system remain under-capitalised and inexperienced in the global
marketplace. The pace of change is quite extraordinary, and many
initiatives which look exciting today are likely to prove impractical
or unconvincing in the real world. For every Netscape Communications
there will undoubtedly be many failures, and ultimately the existing
major players in the computing and telecoms industries are likely to
hold the upper hand.

Nonetheless, the Internet, or something which emerges from it, will be
a permanent feature of our commercial and personal lives, and will
continue as a means of building new markets, developing new profit
centres, and changing and streamlining business operations. Internet
for Business will assist its readers in tracking Internet growth and
development, and in pinpointing the real opportunities for their
organisations and backers in coming years.

The editors of Internet for Business, Andrew Parker and Ray Attwood,
can be contacted by e-mail at intforbus@pearson-pro.com or through the
offices of the publishers, whose details are given on the back page of
this issue.

HARDWARE ALLIANCE MEANS NEW INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS

Late April saw the announcement of the takeover of StrataCom, a leading
supplier of telecoms switching equipment, by Cisco Systems, a market
leader in the manufacture and supply of internetworking equipment
including routers and LAN switches. According to Cisco, the new
relationship will provide an integrated combine, able to provide end-to-
end solutions across public, private or hybrid networks. The move
clearly represents a gearing up by Cisco to meet the expected future
growth in telecoms, Internet and Intranet technology.

The acquisition of StrataCom was carried through under an offer of
shares in Cisco common stock, in exchange for all outstanding shares
and options of StrataCom. With Cisco's common stock valued at a little
under $50, the total value of the transaction was in the region of
$4bn. Final confirmation of the deal is due by late June 1996.

Of most interest in Internet applications is the new group's integrated
ability to handle the advanced switching technologies which are at the
heart of state-of-the-art Internet network systems. The two companies
will have highly-developed expertise in the design and implementation
of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and frame relay high-speed WAN
switching equipment. These technologies are being increasingly adopted
by Internet service providers to offer far more robust and flexible
data communications technology, especially to corporate users.

MASS MARKET IN INTERNET TELEPHONY?

One of the most appealing, and yet controversial products to be
launched for Internet users in recent times has been Internet
telephony. A number of software companies have launched products which
allow Internet users with sound-enabled computers to make two-way
telephone calls over the Internet, throughout the world, for the price
of a local call (or free if they are attached to a corporate Internet
access).

This technology is soon to be delivered to a mass audience by Netscape
Communications, which has announced that an Internet telephony utility
will be integrated into the next generation of its browser software.

The new Netscape browser, to be called Atlas, will include an
application called CoolTalk, which provides the telephony capability.

Initially users will only be able to call other users who are currently
online. CoolTalk will operate with modems at data rates as low as
9,600bps.

Internet telephony has been controversial among the Internet community
since early versions of the software were bandwidth intensive,
blanketing out the more bandwidth-efficient activities such as Web
traffic and e-mail. In some cases Internet service providers even went
so far as to ban the process from their networks.

However, improving audio compression technology appears to be making
the technology more acceptable across the Internet. And it represents a
genuine threat to established telecommunications companies across the
world, especially to their high-priced international telephone
services.

UK NAME REGISTRATION SHAKE UP

A new structure for the registration and administration of Internet
addresses in the UK was announced in mid-April by Dr W Black, the
nominated manager of the .uk space within the overall structure of
domain names on the Internet. The change involves the establishment of
a non-profit company to take over the day-to-day processing of domain
name registrations in the UK, and of a steering committee of industry
representatives to oversee its operation. Membership of the steering
committee is open to all organisations with a legitimate interest in
the name registration process, and will be subject to an annual
membership fee. A system of name registration charges is also proposed
to defray the operating costs of the new establishment. All new
Internet sub-domain names, the core of the Internet addresses used from
day-to-day by all types of user, will incur the charges, although
special arrangements may be made for educational and other non-profit
organisations.

These changes, which will bring the UK into line with other countries
such as Germany, Japan and the commercial domain in North America, have
received a mixed response from within the Internet industry in the UK,
with some suggesting that the planning and decision-making process had
been undertaken with insufficient publicity and consultation. Lack of
information on the changes seems to have caused widespread
misunderstanding of the proposals, including some suggestions that the
move represents an exploitative change attempting to bring more control
of the UK Internet back into the hands of UKERNA, the Government-
established company which controls the operation of the UK's academic
network, JANET. This has been fuelled by the fact that Dr Black, who is
an employee of UKERNA in his current role, has been designated as the
first manager for the new structure.

More realistically, it is clear that stabilisation and regularisation
was needed in this area. There are some 6,000 registered users of
Internet domain names in the .co.uk area alone (this being the domain
name suffix allocated to UK-based commercial Internet addresses). This
number is increasing by 100 every week in second quarter 1996. It is
widely understood that current structures, where commercial Internet
service providers provide voluntary support to UKERNA in administering
name registration for specific sub-domains such as .co.uk, have begun
to unravel under the pressure of expansion occurring in the Internet at
present.

Under the new system, a fixed rate of charging will apply to all new
Internet address registrations - #100 for each new name registered,
covering the first two years of operation, and #50 per year thereafter
to cover the maintenance of the name in the register and central DNS
structures (the computers at the heart of the UK Internet which convert
the day-to-day use of textual forms of addresses into the numeric
Internet protocol addresses used in the operation of the Internet
between computers and networks). Members of the Steering Committee will
qualify for a significant discount on these full rates, on behalf of
their customers, which they are able to pass on in full or in part. It
is intended to commence charging according to the stated scales for all
new name registrations after 31 May 1996. Recurrent charges for
existing names will begin on 1 June 1997.

THE BATTLE OF THE BROWSERS

In almost simultaneous press announcements in mid-March 1996, Microsoft
and Netscape Communications both trumpeted deals confirming close co-
operation between their organisations and America Online (AOL), the
world-leader in the commercial online networks market.

Organisations such as AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy have recently moved
to offer far more flexible Internet access to their users, and have
shown a desire to integrate the best of Internet-specific software into
their user interfaces. Given their large customer bases (AOL alone with
over 5 million users worldwide), it is natural that fierce competitors
such as Netscape and Microsoft should vigorously woo these companies.

In the case of AOL, Microsoft seems to have achieved the more
definitive relationship. AOL has chosen to integrate Microsoft's
Internet Explorer Web browser software seamlessly into its main user
interface, making it the main tool which AOL users will harness in
searching across the World Wide Web. In return, AOL has achieved one of
the goals long sought by the commercial network providers, the
provision of an easy access to its service for Windows 95 users, via a
folder on the desktop of the operating system.

Netscape, by contrast, has reached agreement that its Navigator browser
software should be integrated into the interface for GNN, a more
specialist Internet service operated by AOL. The browser will also be
an option for AOL users generally. In return, Netscape will provide AOL
with a prominent presence within its own Web site.

Microsoft thus appears to have obtained pole position with this major
user base, regarding Internet applications, and will offer AOL users
the benefit of its ongoing development of new Internet software tools
under the ActiveX Technologies programme. These include utilities to
provide animation, 3d, and video to the Internet.

Consolation for Netscape Communications comes in the form of a parallel
deal with CompuServe. Under this agreement, CompuServe is able to
distribute the Netscape Navigator software to users of its CompuServe
Information Service, its core group of online customers, and to users
of the Spry Internet access service, recently acquired by CompuServe.

These moves reflect the more general struggle between Netscape
Communications, as the developer of the dominant browser for World Wide
Web users on today's Internet, and Microsoft, the world's dominant
software company. Microsoft manifestly wishes to wrest away Netscape's
market leadership in this field, and is moving forcefully towards
achieving that end.

PRODIGY LOSES MARKET SHARE

A recent survey by Odyssey, the San Francisco-based research firm
indicates a shift in fortunes for the major online services.

In its Homefront survey, Odyssey found that during the last two years
the market share of the four major online services, America Online
(AOL), CompuServe, Prodigy and Microsoft show a dramatic improvement in
market share for AOL, while similar figures for CompuServe remained
static.

The big loser appears to be Prodigy, with a 50% fall in market share.
Recent reports in the San Jose Mercury News, indicate a possible
management buy-out of Prodigy from its owners IBM and Sears Roebuck for
a sum thought to be under $100m.

NETCOM'S FIRST

Launching its new UK operation and UK Internet access services on 1 May
1996, US specialist Internet service provider (ISP) Netcom became the
first of the major independent ISPs from North America to start an
operation from scratch in the UK.

One of the top three North America specialist access providers, Netcom
has come to the UK market late in comparison with major competitors
such as UUNET Technologies and PSINet. Both these companies chose to
launch into the UK market through acquisition of an existing local
provider. This latter approach has proved of mixed value to its
exponents.

The UK launch for Netcom - its first outside North America - capped a
satisfying early 1996 for the company, which saw its user base climb
above the 400,000 level in April 1996, and its first quarter revenue
for 1996 grow to $24.1m, a growth of 221% over the equivalent period in
1995 (Netcom figures).

Netcom has aimed high, in the creation of its UK operation, hiring over
50 staff by the launch date, and establishing a nationwide network of
virtual points of presence in collaboration with local telco Energis.
Users throughout the country will therefore be able to access Netcom's
dial-up services via a local telephone call. Heading up this UK system
will be new managing director David Clarke, who formerly had a strong
track record in high-level management with Compaq, the successful PC
manufacturer/vendor.

Among the more useful aspects of Netcom's service from day one will be
a full 24-hour, seven days per week customer service facility, and a
range of access services tailored to both business and consumer users.
'We believe we are the only ISP in the UK market offering a truly
competitive Internet solution,' said Clarke.

It will be interesting to track the respective progress of the three
major ISPs now active in the UK market over coming months.

UUNET Technologies, the new owners of Unipalm - PIPEX, arguably the
most effective of the indigenous access providers for the corporate
sector, has major distractions in its own merger with MFS, reported
elsewhere in this issue, and in the delivery of Internet access
services for the Microsoft Network in the UK and elsewhere. PSINet,
having acquired the UK arm of Pan-European provider EUnet, has gone
through a drawn-out process of infrastructure and staff re-development,
to meet the high standards set by its service in the US. Consequently
it has been seen to move backwards in the eyes of many commentators, in
terms of customer credibility and market performance. A full launch of
PSINet's consumer and commercial access services in the UK has still
not been achieved, some seven or eight months after the EUnet GB
acquisition took place.

Given the relative position of these three major players, and the still
small scope of BT's Internet access operation, it may well be advisable
for business users at least to take advice on Netcom's services,
despite their greenness in the UK market.

Netcom may be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.netcom.net.uk.
In addition to providing details on Netcom's UK operations and
services, the site provides a NetNews section, a Web search facility, a
directory of UK Web sites, customer support and frequently-asked
questions (FAQ) information.

SEARCHING SUCCESS FOR DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION

Digital Equipment Corporation Alta Vista search for the World Wide Web,
a latecomer in the field by comparison with other services such as
Lycos, Yahoo and Infoseek, received recognition of its effectiveness
through receipt of an Industry Award for Outstanding Service from US
publication Internet World.

The award, which was announced during the Internet World show in San
Jose, recognises Alta Vista's immediate and widespread adoption by Web
users, since launching in December 1995.

Identified as the most comprehensive search site on the Web during
Internet World's recent testing of search services, Alta Vista has
become a must-use tool for many Web surfers during its short history.
Digital Equipment's own statistics tell the story, with the site now
reaching as many as seven million hits per day.

Since inception, the index maintained for the Alta Vista site has grown
from 16 million full text pages to 22 million (as at April 1996) with
over 11 billion words. The index also covers more than 13,000 of the
USENET newsgroups available over the Internet.

During Internet World in San Jose, Digital Equipment announced plans to
develop the search engines used in the Alta Vista sit into a family of
fast search tools to be marketed into commercial and consumer markets.

AVIS RENT-A-CAR

http://www.avis.com

Avis has become the latest of the major car hire companies to establish
an interactive service on the World Wide Web. The site, known as the
Avis Galaxy, is operated from the US, but offers a worldwide service.

The most convenient aspect of the Web site is the facility to obtain
firm quotes, with a special Web users' discount, and to reserve car
hire bookings, for journeys at home or overseas. A trial use of the
site obtained a discount-rate quote for hiring an intermediate car for
a business trip in California, with the price stated in pounds
Sterling, since the quote was requested in the UK. When first seeking
this information, it was not immediately obvious how to obtain a price
quotation from the site, since the quotation service uses the same
interactive forms as the firm car booking system. But closer
examination showed that users can click on an option requesting a price
quote rather than a firm booking.

Apart from this quibble, the site appears to be well thought out in
terms of navigation, with tool bars at the foot of each page allowing
access to other sections of the site, or a return to the home page.
Users with the graphics capability of their browser switched off, or
with non-graphical browsers, are provided with text-based alternatives
to the graphical hyperlinks which are structured into the site.

In addition to the quotation and reservation service the Avis Galaxy
also provides information on special Avis services such as the
company's Travel Partners scheme and Business Rate Plans, details of
location of the company's main outlets, special offers, e-mail contact
information and a number of other interactive services. Many of the
national Avis operations covered by the Web information provide
pictures of the cars available in their country, together with textual
information describing their features.

The site is configured to be accessed using the Netscape Navigator
browser, and like many of this type, offers the user the option to
download a copy of that software, if they do not already use it.

A GERMAN PRESENCE

http://www.government.de or http://www.bundesregierung.de

The Press and Information Office of the Government of the Federal
Republic of Germany has recently launched a Web site providing a range
of information services for Web users. Details on the site are in
either German or English, with a straightforward navigational process
enabling visitors to the site to select the language required. Site
content is heavily textual, overall, but this is perhaps appropriate to
the rather bureaucratic nature of much of the information.

Users will find that they need to delve fairly seriously to get to more
informative elements in the site, since the first few levels give very
general information which is neither searching nor loaded with factual
content. However, users should persevere, since the site does reward
more careful exploration. One of its most useful elements is a list of
German Web links under a number of potentially helpful categories,
including: general information on Germany; news and media; travel;
German Zip Codes (Search Engine); business and law; exchange programmes
and research; culture and language classes; sport; German government;
political foundations; and the EU and embassies.

The general information category, for example, offers links to a range
of more detailed sites, such as the Deutsche Welle, a government-
supported media organisation, the German Foreign Office home page and
the site maintained by the Goethe Institute, the well-known German
cultural organisation.

The business and law section offers links such as Germany's Top 500
Firms - an alphabetical listing and a listing by size (in English),
reports on German and European financial trends (in English) and
Biz.Travel, a server with information on doing business in Germany and
particular German cities, with listings of Chambers of Commerce.

Other interesting links include pointers to several news magazine and
newspaper Web sites, and a series of online travel services, some of
which provide online reservations and ticket sales.

As with many Web sites, the power of this site is rather more in the
further information which is accessible through it, rather than in the
information which it provides itself.

Anyone familiar with Germany, and doing business in that country, is
likely to find this particularly true, and may well only pinpoint some
of the linked sites as useful for future reference. However, newcomers
to the country and its business practices are likely to find the site
itself more immediately useful.

TECHNICAL AND MEDIA EVENTS CATALOGUED ONLINE

http://www.zdnet.com/zdi/calendar/calendar.html

The ZD Net Trade Show Calendar is a new service offering a calendar of
trade events, worldwide, in the following categories: broadcasting and
media; computer aided technologies; computer hardware/peripherals;
entertainment industry; computer software/services; Information
Technology; engineering; Internet/online services; publishing;
telecoms.

Extracts from the total calendar of events may be obtained using a
search form, which offers the ability to select a given country or
countries, any one or more topics, and a range of dates within which
the events should fall. The search results are presented as a table of
events, including their open dates, the city where they take place and
general subject coverage. A search may also be made for a single event,
using all or part of its title. For each event listed as a result of a
search, a hypertext link takes the user to further details on the show,
including venue information, event frequency, and in some cases details
of visitor and exhibitor attendance at the previous occurrence of the
event.

A test search was performed, retrieving all the events listed during
calendar 1996 covering the topic of Internet. The resulting list
included 16 trade exhibitions and conferences, with the major Internet
events such as Internet World International, Networld and Interop and
Online Information, general computing events such as Comdex/UK,
Computers in Manufacturing and Software Development and more
specialised events such as ECTS, Manufacturing Week and MTQ - Testing
for Quality. The only obvious omissions were events which were launched
recently and were not yet widely-enough publicised to have reached this
US-based database (such as the new Internet '96 Show to be held in
London in October).

PRE-EMPLOYMENT SCREENING ARRIVES

http://www.informus.com

US data search specialist Informus is offering a full range of pre-
employment screening services for US companies on the Web, launched in
early 1996. Companies which wish to use the service are required to
sign up with Informus, and are then provided with an ID and password
enabling them to access a full set of information services online.

Informus places great stress on its security procedures, and the
vetting of customer companies before it obtains access. In this way
every measure is taken to ensure that only bona fide users are able to
access the site, preventing inappropriate or exploitative use.

Charges for the service are processed automatically online and the user
companies billed accordingly. Informus stresses the immediacy of
information availability and the facility for highly selective
information retrieval as the main benefits to users of working on the
Web. Company figures suggest that a typical search for a given job
applicant would cost in the region of $20 - $70, depending on the
nature of information sought.

The Web site is currently configured to offer the active service,
accessible only to registered users, plus a set of demonstrations,
background information on the service and a registration utility for
companies wishing to take up the system. An e-mail contact system is
also provided.

Among the services available from Informus regarding job applicants'
previous histories are: driving records; prior workers' compensation
claims; criminal history; employment records; educational records;
credit ratings from ratings agencies; address detail confirmation;
personal references vetting; and professional licence checking.

Thus the site offers human resources professionals the opportunity, for
example, to check an applicant's claim to have a clean driving licence,
or to examine claims regarding past salary and employment details or
educational and professional qualifications. The main areas of the
service currently used by subscribers, according to Informus, are
driving reports, criminal history information, address history,
previous employment record and credit history.

GET WEBBED UP ON CANADIAN DOCUMENTS

Micromedia, a Toronto-based corporate information source, has launched
a new service on the Web to offer company and document tracking
services in the Canadian corporate sector. The service, known as
Canadian Research and Electronic Documents Ordering Service (CREDO),
offers searching across a 600,000-entry index of corporate filings
covering the Ontario Securities Commission and Industry Canada,
together with selected documents from the Vancouver and Montreal
markets.

Users are able to search for individual documents or companies online,
and to create personal information profiles which the CREDO service
will then monitor for them. Under the latter option, an alert is issued
to the user each time a new document is obtained within the profile
established.

Once documents have been identified for the user, Micromedia is able to
deliver copies to users in North America using same day or overnight
delivery services or three hour delivery locally in Toronto. Home and
overseas users may use the fax alternative. A full scale of charges for
actual document access and delivery is published as part of the site.

INTERNET LINES THROWN OPEN IN SAN JOSE

The Internet industry, along with its current and potential customers,
descended in unprecedented numbers on San Jose, California at the end
of April, for the 1996 Internet World conference and exhibition. With
over 350 exhibitors, and estimated visitor numbers in the region of
40,000 according to organisers Mecklermedia, the event is once again
the largest Internet-specific trade show in the world. Ray Attwood and
Andrew Parker were there...

Based at the heart of Silicon Valley, still the creative engine of much
of today's computer industry, Internet World achieved an impressive
array of new product announcements, mergers and acquisitions. Some of
the most important of these are described elsewhere in this issue,
including our lead story on the merger of UUNET Technologies and MFS
Communications Company (see front page) to form one of the strongest
operations in the Internet field. The event has been so successful that
it has been transferred into the Los Angeles Convention Center for
1997, the only exhibition and conference facility on the West Coast of
the US able to handle the show's size and complexity. Mecklermedia
sources predicted a likely growth to around 500 exhibitors for 1997
(citing the fact that a 75-strong waiting list for exhibit space
existed for the 1996 event), and to well in excess of 50,000 visitors.

Internet World's development as an event is a true mirror of the
development of the commercial Internet industry itself. Launched four
years ago, the first West Coast event only attracted in the region of
50 exhibitors, and less than a tenth of this year's visitor turnout.
This has changed to such a degree that all the major players of the US
computer industry were represented at the event in 1996, with the likes
of IBM, Microsoft and Digital Equipment using the show as a platform to
launch a plethora of Internet-related initiatives. Along with these,
representatives of other major sectors such as telecoms were equally
active, as exemplified by AT&T's launching of its new WorldNet global
Internet access service.

Not even the arrival of summer-like weather, with temperatures soaring
into the 90s, seemed to discourage the eager Internet users thronging
around the booths. However, the major impact of the 1996 event on
attendees was not so much in the new products and services to be
identified on a high percentage of the stands at the show. Instead the
lasting impression created focused on two areas. One is a process of
consolidation, as a host of companies active in the Internet sector
seek to build formal or informal alliances, merge or acquire within the
industry, and share technologies. Microsoft and Netscape, among several
others, are major collaborators in the establishment of the SET
protocol for secure credit card transactions over the Internet and
World Wide Web. Search engine and Internet search specialist Lycos has
licensed its core technology to Frontier Technologies for its
CyberSearch software product, a unique, browser-independent system for
performing Web searching and storing information on sites visited for
future reference. Traveling Software, producer of the popular PC-
linking package, Laplink, announced at the show its acquisition of
Milktruck Software, a pioneering start-up company developing offline
Web browsing and Web site capture utilities. These are but a few of the
deals and agreements which the show brought to the attention of the
wider world.

The emerging force of Intranets

The other major process within the Internet industry, highlighted at
the show, is the emergence of Intranets as a key focus of the marketing
and product development activities of the Internet sector. Intranets
are treated more fully in a separate article in this issue of Internet
for Business. In brief, however, these represent the development of
Internet-based software tools and techniques to provide cost-effective
and easy-to-use sharing of electronic information resources within the
corporate or organisational computer environment. This may be across
either local area networks or wide area networks. A new enthusiasm for
Intranets has been driven by recognition among Internet developers that
many medium to large-sized companies remain more open to innovative
information technology tools within their management information
systems, rather than in communicating with the world at large. Equally,
the tools available for the sharing of, for example, electronic
documents over a corporate network have been relatively expensive up to
the present, and Internet-developed software tools often allow similar
levels of functionality at lesser cost. Thus a major marketing
opportunity has been recognised by the wider Internet industry, and the
focus on Intranets has been consciously developed to allow clear
recognition by potential buyers of the different focus of products
offered in this area. The term Intranet was omnipresent at San Jose,
despite being seldom used across the industry up to late 1995.

Internet World 1996 was clearly a resounding success for its
organisers, and the buzz across the exhibit halls also suggested a
level of satisfaction among the exhibitors. It stands out as a staging
post in the development of Internet business. The continuing sections
of this article set out some of the more interesting changes, deals,
products and services which were aired at the show.

General Internet systems

Microsoft Corporation, in a battery of announcements, focused mainly on
its upgrading of the Microsoft BackOffice Server Suite version 2.0. The
enhancements launched during Internet World included built in messaging
and groupware software, a high-performance Web server and an updated
database, all with inbuilt support for both Internet and Intranet
activity.

Electronic forms specialists JetForm, of Falls Church, Vancouver
announced a new intelligent forms system for the Web. Delivering far
greater flexibility and complexity of operation than standard HTML
forms, JetForm's family of utilities will allow the implementation of
complex data retrieval processes over the Web for both Internet and
Intranet environments. Included within the family of software
applications are a Server for creating and uploading forms, a form
filler client programme for end users and the Web Connectivity Pak
which collects data from forms and delivers it to the server for data
processing.

In a similar move, Decisive Technology Corporation of Palo Alto,
California, launched its desktop survey software suite, under the
Decisive Survey name. Decisive Survey software is designed to allow
survey developers to create and implement e-mail mediated surveys over
both Intranets and the Internet proper.

Reflecting a slow but steady move towards better multilingual
capability on the Web, and on the Internet at large, Israeli software
developers Accent Software introduced a multilingual plug-in for the
Netscape Navigator Web browser. Using the Accent plug-in, surgers will
be able to view sites written in more than 30 different languages
transcribed correctly on screen, including the use of any special
accents or scripts which may be required. The plug-in also enables
multilingual configuration of all the operating information within the
Netscape browser.

Electronic commerce developments

Among the most eagerly awaited software utilities for the whole
Internet community is the Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) secure
credit card transaction process. This protocol, sponsored jointly by
MasterCard, Visa and several of the giants of Internet software
development such as Microsoft and Netscape, will allow easy-to-use,
secure processing of credit card transactions over the World Wide Web.

Claiming to be the first software developer to implement SET fully,
Terisa Systems of Los Altos, California, demonstrated its prototype SET
software solution, which processes credit card transactions in a three-
way link between purchaser, credit card merchant and the banks'
international financial transaction processing networks. Terisa
confidently predicts preliminary availability of its SET software, for
inclusion into other developers' online systems, for June 1996.

A more detailed examination of SET technology will appear in an issue
of Internet for Business later this year.

Intranet solutions

Inmagic of Woburn, Massachusetts, launched Navigation Server, offering
a broad range of searching, indexing and cataloguing capability for
corporate Intranet systems. Building on search technology licensed from
search specialists Lycos, the new product allows users to search across
and display on screen, not only HTML documents, but also information in
word processor and spreadsheet formats. A further facility will be the
creation of HTML output dynamically from database material in native
database formats.

IBM announced a number of Intranet-related initiatives at the show,
including a series of firewall and security products, Web production
and editing software, and the integration of its infoSage service into
Lotus Notes. InfoSage is a news delivery service available over
Internet and Intranet environments, drawing on news feeds from
organisations such as Dun and Bradstreet, COMTEX and Information Access
Company.

A further announcement from IBM concerned the launch of Crytolope
technology, a system allowing the encryption of individual messages or
documents for transmission across Internet and Intranet services, with
access only available to the authorised recipient.

Internet news service

The Wall Street Journal announced its new Internet online service on
the Web, claiming it to be the first online news service to launch with
a subscription/charging structure in operation from its inception.

The Web site, known as the Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition,
offers a basic range of services, including headline information
updated several times a day, free of charge. Paying users will be able
to access more detailed information underlying the headlines, including
access to analytical and financial information compiled in the
Journal's newsroom, and to create their own personalised news profile
drawn from the full range on the service, which will then be delivered
daily to their desktop computer.

Subscribers who sign up with the service before 31 May 1996 will be
able to use the full site free until 31 July. Thereafter, the
subscription will be $49 per year, or $29 for existing Wall Street
Journal subscribers.

HTML editors, converters and Web site management suites

One of the most notable changes in Internet software over the past 12
months has been the vast upgrading of HTML features, allowing a whole
host of flexible services on Web pages. Among these are the ability to
handle details in table format, the Netscape-specific frames
technology, which allows the definition of several different spaces
within one Web page, each of which may be scrolled through and changed
independently of the others.

The downside of these changes is that many new codes and syntax
features have been added to the earlier versions of the hypertext mark-
up language (HTML) used to construct pages for publication on the Web.
Fortunately for users, the software industry has kept up with this
process, and Internet World saw the launch of a range of new or
upgraded utilities which allow point and click editing of HTML,
compilation of HTML documents from templates, conversion of existing
word processor or desktop publishing files into HTML and proving of
finished HTML pages within a true or simulated browser display.

Internet for Business will be publishing a more detailed examination of
these utilities, and exploring their effectiveness for businesses on
the Web, in a later issue. Among the more interesting software in this
field in San Jose were SoftQuad's new version 3.0 of its HotMetal Pro
HTML editor, the Spider HTML editor from InContext, and a piece of
software named HTML Transit, from InfoAccess, which allows direct
automatic conversion into HTML format from a range of word processor
file formats. Others active in this market include Adobe with its
Pagemill product, IBM/Lotus with a new utility called The WebMaster's
Apprentice, and Microsoft with its Front Page and Internet Assistant
utilities.

SoftQuad also showed beta versions of a new utility named Panorama Pro,
which employs additional document mark-up technology, drawing on ISO
standards, to establish style sheets for HTML documents.

This is a particularly interesting development, since style sheets for
HTML have previously been an unrealised wish for much of the Web
development community. Before Panorama Pro, the most likely candidate
for creating more controlled appearance of documents on the Web had
appeared to the Adobe's Acrobat and Postscript technologies.

However, SoftQuad has achieved similar functionality with much more
efficient file sizes, and its system looks to be one worth tracking.
Internet for Business plans to bring you up to date on this in a later
issue.

Internet access services

PSINet of Herndon, Virginia, took the opportunity of Internet World to
announce a new mobile Internet access service, WorldLink. WorldLink is
a flat-rate service irrespective of the location from which it is used,
providing what PSINet claims to be the industry's first master account
management capability via the Web. Connection may be made via ISDN for
between $29.95 and $49.95 according to bandwidth, or by modem.

Networked Internet systems

Computer networking giant Novell announced an agreement with TCP/IP
software specialists Frontier Technologies Corporation, whereby Novell
will integrate TCP/IP functionality into its networking solutions. The
system will employ Frontier's SuperNFS client software for TCP/IP
applications, with operation available in several languages including
US English, French, German and Japanese.

Java tools

Several companies move the Sun Microsystems Java programming language
closer to being the simple tool desired by average business and
consumer users by introducing Graphic User Interfaces enabling Java
application development without line-by-line code needing to be
written.

Among those in this field were PowerProduction Software of Hermosa
Beach, California, with its WebBurst Java authoring tool, and Aimtech
Corporation of Nashua, New Hampshire, with its Jamba Java authorising
software. Such tools move Java firmly into the everyday application
field, and may well lead to a far wider implementation of realtime
programming applets (as Java routines are known) across the Web.

INTERNET SHOPPING - TWO CONTRASTING APPROACHES

A major area of commercial activity on the Internet has been the
appearance of virtual shopping malls. These have met with mixed success
and the dream of opening a store front to a global audience without the
associated overhead costs of traditional retail stores has not always
proved to be successful in its realisation. Indeed many stores in the
various electronic malls have found sales of products to be meagre.

While some malls have closed, others have changed their approach using
experience gained in previous attempts, to modify or completely restyle
their retailing activity based on the experiences of Internet shoppers.
After studying the way shopping is carried out on the Internet and
gaining a clearer idea of the profile and buying habits of internet
customers, more carefully-targeted sites are now appearing on the Net.

Two examples of different approaches to retailing in this new
environment can be seen by comparing the Internet Shopping Network,
based in Palo Alto, California with Online Interactive which is centred
in Seattle, Washington.

The Internet Shopping Network was founded in June 1993 and is an
established player by Internet standards. It is now a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Home Shopping Network which has a 10-year track record of
TV shopping to its name. The purchase of ISN in 1994 was seen as a
means to expand Home Shopping Network's reach into cyberspace and gain
access to the potential of a worldwide customer base.

ISN's reorganisation

Originally operating as part of the plethora of online malls which
sprang up over the past two years - represented by a wide range of
different products and suppliers - ISN has now re-organised its Web
site with changes in site navigation, graphics, format and content
aimed at providing a new approach from a redesigned Home Page and
concentrating on a well-defined and proven area of the online market.
Not surprisingly this market sector is in retailing computer hardware
and software where ISN's experience has indicated the best results can
be found.

Currently ISN offers over 25,000 products from more than 600 major
companies and makes use of a special feature called the 'Downloadable
Software Store' to take advantage of the unique attributes which the
Internet can lend to retailers. At this site a customer can gain
instant access to over 45 software product selections which may be
instantly purchased and downloaded direct from ISN to the user's own
computer. Thus ISN users benefit from the major attraction of Internet
shopping - convenience and speed. This is particularly useful when
dealing with experienced computer users who make up a large proportion
of the purchasers and who appreciate the advantages of a site modelled
on new paradigms rather than trying to create a replica shopping mall.
This profile will gradually change as more shoppers are found from
within the ISN links to AOL, Compuserve and Prodigy. These are services
where customers will often tend to be less computer literate. The
recent addition of 'Power Search' and 'Subject Category' will help in
this case by producing a list of the most relevant product or products
depending on a customer's interest. This type of service, using the
specific searching strengths available over the Internet, really begins
to demonstrate the useful way in which Internet retailing can be of
benefit to less experienced computer users too. With the recent
agreement to retail many of Microsoft's popular packages through the
Downloadable Software Site, ISN will find an increasing customer base
among this group.

ISN customers of course need to register before transactions can take
place and this requires an approved credit card, e-mail address, and
billing and shipping addresses. Once these details are received across
what ISN claims is a secure network, then all future transactions can
be carried out using a membership code, with all credit card
information kept offline. ISN uses Netscape Commerce server for
commercial transactions with security features including server
authorisation, data encryption, data integrity, and user authorisation.

Another organisation with an agreement to sell Microsoft products is
Online Interactive, which will retail through its atOnce Software
Store, again highlighting the importance attached to convenience and
speed of service in Internet retailing.

The company uses an online sales process based on a high speed Web site
for marketing and downloading encrypted software from the Internet.
After the desired software has been downloaded in encrypted form,
Ziplock collects credit card data, and in a separate, modem-based call,
directly routes the entire order to a secure proprietary network with
no credit card information ever passing across the Internet. After
authentication is complete and credit card approval given, an unlocking
'Key' is transmitted to the customer's computer. Ziplock then installs
the software, decrypting it to make it available for the customer's
use.

A commercial twist

In addition to atOnce software, Online Interactive also operates the
FreeShop Online, which takes the original ethos behind the operation of
the Internet, i.e. free access to information, and gives it a
commercial twist. The FreeShop is a means of providing direct marketing
and advertising for consumer products and services which are promoted
through free offers. This provides marketers with the ability to reach
a large customer group for a low charge and for the customers to sample
products free of charge. Online Interactive claim that since its
inception FreeShop Online has generated more than one million
electronic orders for over 180 companies. Recent evidence indicates
that between 18-30% of visitors are buying as a result of free offers
derived from the site.

FreeShop claims to process demographic information and leads on a daily
basis by e-mail when a free offer is selected and in so doing allows
prompt interaction between suppliers and customers which they claim
will aid the formation of future customer loyalty. A twice weekly
consolidated paper/label service is also available for fulfilment
purposes. While statistical evidence is not readily available, FreeShop
currently claims around 100,000 orders per month and rising among the
more popular online retailers in its site.

The offers are grouped in intuitive categories to allow easier and more
effective browsing and it is again claimed that on average three clicks
are usually sufficient to move the shopper from storefront to order
screen thus alleviating one of the major design disadvantages of many
electronic malls where endless web pages of ill-matching links nullify
the speed and convenience of shopping on the web. The popular
categories for the site are proving to be computing, magazines,
finance, entertainment and fitness products.

The effect of promotions on customer response rates is particularly
interesting and can increase interest and acceptance of offers by up to
ten times. This is achieved by a mixture of chat lines, contests,
spotlights and a club newsletter.

FreeShop is designed primarily as a lead-generating facility for
organisations which operate direct marketing strategies. By operating
FreeShop in the context of services such as America Online, and the
Microsoft Network, Online Interactive gains access to many millions of
consumer and business users. Companies promoting their products and
services through FreeShop normally follow up any leads generated by the
site by sending out free samples, catalogues or other promotional
information in the mail. However, a growing number of companies are
resorting to delivery of electronic promotional information to FreeShop
users.

These two contrasting versions of consumer retailing over the Internet
are beginning to represent the way in which this medium can provide a
truly useful and effective service to consumers. As technology develops
and the experience of other electronic malls is put to practical use
the whole concept and presentation of such retailing will evolve from
the current designs to show marked changes which no longer reflect the
transfer of outmoded and inappropriate concepts to the Web.

Internet for Business will track further developments in this field and
provide regular updates on new developments.

INTRANETS - THE NEW GROWTH PHENOMENON

During the last two years, a great deal of attention has been focused
on the development of the Internet and in particular on the external
uses of the World Wide Web. As the Internet began its transformation
from a medium used primarily by government departments, academics and
researchers to one with a commercial bias, the spotlight still remained
fixed on the comparative merits of different corporate Web sites and
the traffic which they generated.

While the debate about 'hits' on a web site, together with the problems
of transmission times for graphics and worries over security all
occupied the media, a quiet but fundamental shift was beginning to take
place within corporate structures. This involved the adoption of
Internet technology and the TCP/IP protocols on which it runs to form
corporate-wide networks 'Intranets'. Lacking in the immediate glamour
or controversy that many Web sites have generated, this application of
the Internet has been disregarded by many commentators. Instead the
issues concerning the informative, PR, sales and marketing potential of
Web sites have all been scrutinised and discussed with increasing
frequency. As this debate made headline news much less was said about
the ability of Intranets to perform vital business applications within
corporate structures.

More haste, less thought...

It is hardly surprising, therefore, that in the frenetic rush to place
information on the World Wide Web, many organisations have put up Web
pages with little thought to strategic planning and the real benefits
which might accrue to the company. The desire to claim a place out
there on the 'Net' and promote the company image with Web pages full of
hypertext links and colourful graphics has also outweighed the more
prosaic but beneficial use of a strategy which uses one or more servers
to allow password entry for nominated staff, suppliers or customers, to
gain network access and use e-mail within corporate environments linked
to LAN-based information and interfaced with the Internet.

However, recent statistical evidence does indicate that companies are
now realising what the Internet and its associated technologies can
offer, and this is leading to a change in approaches to strategic
planning as the potential of Intranets impacts upon corporate minds and
begins to show up in future growth predictions. Zone Research, based in
Redwood, California, reports that during 1996 revenue from sales of
Intranet servers will outstrip those for general Internet use, and by
1997/98 will exceed Internet server sales by a factor of three to four
times. In monetary terms this represents a private Intranet market in
1997 of over $4bn, and approaching $8bn in 1998. It is thought that
over 50% of the world's largest corporations are now actively planning
to develop their own private networks in Intranet form.

Benefits of Intranet communications

With such a fast growing and lucrative market, many of the hardware and
software suppliers within the Internet industry are re-focusing their
sales and promotion efforts towards intranet applications. This change
of focus is set to become an established feature in future advertising
and marketing campaigns, and at events such as the recent Internet
World Show in San Jose, California, where many companies were featuring
benefits of developing intranet communications. Digital Equipment
Corporation, for example, announced an Intranet strategy that will
supply its products and services as 'Intranet ready'. By providing a CD-
ROM they can turn Open VMS, Digital Unix, or WindowsNT servers into
Intranet-ready systems, and in co-operating with Microsoft and Netscape
are ensuring that their customers will be presented with ready-made
solutions on Digital Platforms. Established browser software will be
supplemented by firewall systems, to ensure secure connection of the
corporate Intranet to the Internet at large. For remote users Digital
will then offer 'tunnelling' software utilities which allow authorised
individuals to access information within the corporate Intranet, across
the firewall boundary.

Promoting internal corporate networking

Novell's recent announcement of its new corporate Intranet server
called 'Inner Web Publisher' is also indicative of the new emphasis now
being placed on specifically promoting internal corporate networking,
and the move to integrate servers with software tools to make them
seamless and easy to use. This can be seen by the recent agreement
between Novell and SoftQuad to bundle HoTMetal Light (the freeware
version of SoftQuad's high end HTML editor, HoTMetal Pro) with Novell's
product and allow end-users the ability to take advantage of
increasingly sophisticated Web authoring and publishing software.

Intranets explained

With so much effort now being focused on Intranets, therefore, it is
appropriate at this stage to ask just what Intranets are, and why are
they so important? At its simplest an Intranet could be described as an
'internal Internet' which allows employees secure access, often behind
firewall technology, to corporate information systems, but with the
added advantages of external links to the Internet itself. The benefits
of access to vast information resources which are so characteristic of
the Internet can also be duplicated by the Intranet for distributing
internal company information. 'Information mining' has been a feature
of Internet for some time as the research potential of huge remote
databases has been realised.

This situation is mirrored in many corporations where not only current
information, but also archive or 'legacy' information stored often in
previously incompatible hardware and software systems needs to be made
widely accessible in-house. New Web applications can allow Intranets to
tie new applications and legacy resources into a seamless interface.
Why is this so important? The importance of such a system can be seen
from a number of viewpoints.

In an increasingly competitive environment any company which can plan
and manage its communications effectively, and where appropriate,
provide an interface with external customers and markets, will gain
maximum leverage from its information assets. In any corporate strategy
this internal communications benefit of an Intranet should be
considered as one of the first building blocks of any overall Internet
strategy, often before creating a public face using an external Web
site, which on its own may prove to be of dubious worth.

The type of information which can be manipulated in this way indicates
the real potential for companies to benefit from better use of their
own internal data, links with additional external data, and the
customisation of this information as required for either internal uses
or external purposes.

Information can vary from general company announcements where a company
may, for example, mount its corporate policy manuals as Web sites
rather than print lots of copies of the document for physical
distribution, to the provision of sales and performance data, personal
employee communications and highly secret management information.

The amount and range of information which can be accessed is great but
the ability to reduce this quickly and easily to relevant core data as
required, in a secure environment and at a fraction of the cost
previously associated with such an exercise, are the real reasons for
the interest in Intranets. An example of this application can be seen
in the recent announcement from Inmagic a leader in text-based
technology which has licensed spidering technology from Lycos to
deliver 'DB/Text Navigator Server', a new product that will allow
spidering, searching, indexing and cataloguing of corporate Intranets.

This will include the integration of Lycos' Web spiders with InMagic's
'DB/Text WebServer' to provide a powerful search and publishing engine.
Harnessing this technology, a corporate Intranet user will be able to
structure indexes and search processes for all users across the whole
information resources of the company. IBM is also using the Intranet
focus as part of its repositioning in this marketplace, and as a major
plank in gaining ground lost over the past ten years to major
competitors like Microsoft. New links announced by the IBM Global
Network service to provide Lotus Notes for use in Intranets as well as
public networks are an example of this and will form part of a more
detailed feature on IBM in a later issue of Internet for Business.

Flexibility at a low cost

The open standards that form the basis of Intranet technology allow
companies a great deal of flexibility when adapting their own
communications strategy without the historic need to consider costly
options for matching the current software and hardware they use.
Together with an ever-growing acceptance by employees of the benefits
of using hypertext links to locate information and the relatively cheap
cost of purchase, the advantages begin to mount up. An ability to
record better productivity levels while achieving cost reductions is a
powerful incentive for companies to look carefully at the adoption of
Intranets.

While these reasons alone would be sufficient to persuade many
managers, the advantages become even greater when management and
employees link into external communications streams either
asynchronously or in realtime with suppliers and customers or perhaps
sales personnel at geographically remote locations and across different
time zones. Internet for Business will continue to explore the theme of
Intranets in forthcoming issues. Wherever possible examples of best
practice will be highlighted, offering readers greater insight into the
practical benefits and organisational implications of adopting Intranet
methods.

YAHOO FLOATS HIGH ON STOCKMARKET

The well-known Internet service company run by chief Yahoo Jerry Wang
went public in April with what seems an almost inevitable clamour for
shares by all those expecting to make a killing from dealing in high
profile Internet companies.

A total of 2.6 million shares started at $13 on NASDAQ before soaring
to over $40 in one of the largest ever first day gains, according to
industry sources. As with many Internet companies (e.g. Netscape or
Easynet in the UK) the share price exceeded expectations for a company
with only just over one year's trading to its name and a loss making
revenue of under $1.4m. The result of all this activity was a market
capitalisation of over $1bn.

Yahoo is primarily an Internet-based search engine and directory
service for a medium which is notoriously large, unstable and therefore
difficult to quantify and record accurately. It has since been imitated
by several other products and recently lost its premier place in the
Netscape Web site as other competitors began eating into its market.
This competition together with an unknown potential to gain advertising
revenue has not deterred visitors who seem more impressed by the six
million hits per day which the service claims.

LYCOS RECORDS GROWTH IN VIEWING FIGURES

While much media attention has recently been given to the Yahoo
flotation, another company operating a search tool, Lycos, has also
been registering some strong gains.

Incorporated in June 1995, and with a market capitalisation of around
$250m this company has according to its president and CEO Robert Davis,
recently recorded up 4.5 million viewings per day from a figure of 6.5
million per month in mid-1995. The site now claims to have 100 separate
organisations advertising on it including Visa, Mastercard, Disney and
Hilton Hotels.

Advertising rates are levied on either a subject or general basis and
charges vary from $20,000 per million viewings to $50,000 per million
viewings.

Lycos, which now licenses its search software to 18 companies including
AT&T and Microsoft, has according to Davis, revenues growing from $215m
in the first quarter of its current financial year to $825m in the
second quarter ending 31 January 1996. Its agreement to license
spidering technology to companies like InMagic for the burgeoning
Intranet market should see continued growth figures.

DATA TRANSMISSION, DATA COMPRESSION AND THE WEB

This article provides an explanation of some of the factors involved in
causing slow response times on the Internet and explores the technology
of data compression, which is perhaps the most promising avenue of
development in resolving these difficulties.

One of the thornier practical issues facing any organisation wishing to
distribute information over the Internet is the question of data
transmission rates. All too often, when trying to view a Web site,
information passes across the Internet so slowly that a page may take
several minutes to take shape on the user's monitor screen. This is
especially true where large quantities of graphical or textual
information have been built into the site being viewed, because of the
extra time taken to download this heavy content over the Internet.

When designing a Web site, a clear conflict exists between the wish to
provide complex, visually appealing information and the need to create
Web structures which will transmit across the Internet, page-by-page,
in acceptable time periods. The results of these conflicts are clear to
see across the Web. A year ago many Web sites boasted substantial,
graphically complex home pages, often with well over 200 kilobytes of
information. This graphically-rich approach was then carried through
the presentation of the whole site. By contrast, in second quarter
1996, most well-informed Web producers have cut back on the graphical
content of sites, using smaller graphical images to enhance the appeal
of Web pages without making them the fundamental building blocks of the
information. The perceived problems in this area are so severe that
many players are waiting to see what technical solutions may evolve,
before committing themselves to large scale online publishing activity
across the Internet.

Limitations on data transmission rates

It is often assumed that the speed with which data can be retrieved
across the Internet is basically tied to the speed of the access
available to the individual user. Thus the expectation is that a dial-
up user with a 9,600 bps (bit per second) modem will always find data
transfer vastly slower than someone using a state-of-the-art 28.8kbps
(28,800 bits per second) modem. Corporate users with 64kbps ISDN
connections, or Mbps leased line connections are seen as still better
off.

This is true to a certain extent. The average data transmission rate
achieved in a given Internet transaction will generally be partly
dependent on the speed of the final access stage. However, other
factors come into play. Because the Internet works by sharing the
available data transmission bandwidth (total amount of data
transmissable between two points over a given time) between all the
transactions occurring between any two points, the speed of
transmission achieved by any single transaction is dependent on the
weight of traffic competing for the same route.

Additionally, one must also take account of the loading on the server
(source-end computer) which is providing the information to be
retrieved. The busier the server, the slower its response to any given
request.

Add all these factors together and one can see some fairly surprising
results. So, for example, if a UK modem dial-up Internet user retrieves
a 10MB file from a server in the US, it would be quite common for the
average data transmission rate achieved across the whole transaction to
be only in the region of 1 to 1.5 kbps. This is well below the
theoretical transmission capability of the current state-of-the-art
modem, and would result in a total file transfer time in the order of
hours rather than seconds.

The major benefit of faster access is that when the rest of the system
does speed up, the faster device can achieve faster transient data
rates. This in turn achieves a higher average data transmission rate
over the course of one large transaction, or many smaller ones,
improving the overall efficiency of the system.

Data compression techniques

The data transmission efficiency of the Internet, and the Web in
particular, is dependent on a whole host of factors beyond the sheer
speed of connection operated by an individual user. Since this is true,
and as data transmission can be a tediously slow process over the
global networks, measures must be sought elsewhere which can increase
the overall efficiency of the system and individual transactions. High
on the list of technologies which may be adopted to this end is the
technique of data compression.

Most personal computer users will by now have encountered data
compression in some form. Utilities such as PKZIP or WINZIP have become
widely used in compressing software and textual information, so that
they may be transported more efficiently on disk, and many software
packages now require a fairly lengthy de-compression stage during their
first installation on a given computer. Such compression/de-compression
techniques can equally be applied to graphics files, which take up such
a large proportion of the time taken in retrieving Web pages from the
servers on which Web sites are mounted.

The benefits of using data compression in preparing information for
mounting on the Web are manifold, with gains across the whole Internet.
The Web now generates a substantial proportion of all Internet data
traffic. Any steps to reduce the file sizes, and thus the data
congestion across the system in total, make the whole experience of
Internet use more rewarding and more efficient. Equally, for an
individual organisation mounting a Web site, its users will be
generally far more comfortable in using the site when retrieving
compressed data.

Some commonly available compression technologies have the ability to
reduce graphics files down to between a tenth and a twentieth of their
original size, without perceptible loss of quality on screen when the
files are retrieved. Going back to our hypothetical 10MB file, this
would mean that the retrieval time involved in calling the file across
the Internet at our average data rate of 1.2kbps would be reduced to
minutes. Of course there is a small lag introduced because the client
computer receiving the compressed file has then to de-compress it,
which is a finite process. However, the de-compression period is
usually significantly less than the time saved in transmitting the file
across the Internet, meaning that all sides obtain benefit from the use
of compression.

Compression standards on the Internet

Of course there is one major rider to consider. Most compression
techniques require the attendant de-compression utility to be available
to the end-user. This is certainly true of the majority of graphics
compression techniques which may be applied to images for the Web. This
means that a Web site developer must either find the means to provide
each user of the site with the de-compression software for the
particular compression technique employed, or that a compression
technology must be selected which is already widely used across the
Internet.

Until recently, the Internet had adopted as a de facto standard for
graphic image file compression a technology known as the graphics
interchange format (GIF). So prevalent was the use of this technique
that the term GIF had become almost synonymous with the term graphical
image among Web users. GIF is a fairly straightforward compression
technique, designed specifically for use with network systems and for
the realtime transfer of graphics files. Its original developer was the
CompuServe commercial network service, and from there it spread widely
across the Internet. Most Web browser software utilities, up to the
present time, include a GIF reader to provide their standard image
processing capability.

But this useful and almost ubiquitous technology has come under threat,
because the core compression technology employed is under patents held
by its original developers, the Unisys company in the US. Unisys took
steps in late 1994 to enforce its patents, which in turn obliged
CompuServe to put in place a licensing system, requiring any new
software developer using GIF processes to pay royalties on their
application. The response of the Web community, and Internet software
developers, has been to work up a new compression standard, which is
seen as a full replacement for the GIF technology. This new compression
standard is known as the portable network graphic (PNG, pronounced
'ping'). The development of PNG has been undertaken by an international
group of developers under the wing of the World Wide Web Consortium,
W3C, based at MIT. W3C is the nearest thing there is to an overriding
authority controlling the protocols, standards and development of the
World Wide Web, although it has no formal powers.

PNG is still under development, but though still less prevalent than
GIF, is fairly commonly used by Web sites.

The three most commonly available graphics compression techniques on
the Internet are as follows:

- GIF - the Graphics Interchange Format developed by CompuServe;

- PNG - Portable Network Graphics format;

- JPEG - a graphics compression standard developed by an international
standards committee known as the Joint Photographic Experts Group
(universally known as 'Jaypeg'). JPEG techniques are now available as a
built-in feature of the Netscape Navigator Web browser, and are
becoming increasingly common as a means of reproducing graphical images
for Web applications.

Before going into any detailed comparison of these methodologies, it is
necessary briefly to explain the difference between 'lossless' and
'lossy' compression techniques. Lossless compression (as in GIF and PNG
methods) essentially defines the full image when it is compressed, in
such a way that repeated cycles of compression and de-compression
produce an identical image each time.

In lossy compression, the essential concept is that, for reproduction
on a computer screen, or using a colour printer, the amount of detail
available in any given electronic image file is actually greater than
the human eye can resolve. Techniques have been developed such that
information can be discarded during compression, and still leave the
image of a sufficient quality to appear identical to human vision, when
it is de-compressed. Detailed pixel-by-pixel (a pixel being the
smallest indivisible element in the image) analysis would reveal that
some of the pixels in the image have been changed, typically by some
form of averaging process, so that the detailed definition of the image
is significantly reduced by such compression/de-compression methods.
The benefit of this approach (as used by JPEG) is that substantially
higher compression ratios may be obtained from the same original data,
by comparison with lossless compression. However, repeated cycles of
compression and de-compression will result in substantial deterioration
of the image quality.

Features desirable in image handling

In presenting images on the Web, and allowing them to be downloaded by
Web users, a certain number of features are sought from the software
employed:

1. Streamability - the technique employed should allow for the image to
be transmitted serially (that is bit-by-bit) across a network;

2. Progressive display - the image being retrieved by the client
browser software is progressively built up on the monitor screen,
either section-by-section, or as a progressively more detailed picture
across the whole area of the image;

3. Transparency - the ability to define one colour within the original
image, or some defined portion of the image, as transparent. This
enables the image to be placed against a background of differing colour
in such a way that the background colour replaces the desired portion
of the original image;

4. The ability to store ancillary information, such as non-printing
text, within the data structure of the compressed file;

5. Hardware and software independent operation;

6. Lossless compression, for preference, since many applications of
graphics transfer over computer networks may require images to be open
to examination by computer systems, rather than just by the naked eye,
or to be employed in processes such as print origination;

7. The ability to handle colour palettes employed in typical personal
computer monitor and software systems, such as the 256 colour palette
devised for early versions of Windows.

Both GIF and PNG standards offer all these features, but PNG has a
number of other advantages.

It also handles truecolour images - those which employ a colour-
blending process to generate the areas of each colour across the image,
rather than a defined colour palette, and a more sophisticated
grayscale process.

It offers a system called the alpha channel, allowing transparency to
be defined across the full image, rather than for a particular single
colour from a palette, or particular part of the image. And gamma
correction is provided, allowing the image intensity to be adjusted
according to the likely application to which the image will be devoted.
More sophisticated error correction techniques are also found in PNG as
is faster building of initial elements in the progressive display of
the image across network links. Unlike GIF, PNG is now designed to be
an open standard without legal obligation to pay royalties or licence
fees to its developers.

By comparison, JPEG is not designed to offer the same spread of
functionality as either the GIF or PNG standards. The compression
technique devised for the JPEG standard was seen as providing a first-
rate means of processing truecolour photographic material, and complex
hand-drawn artwork, along with more complex, naturalistic halftone
images. JPEG is not well adapted for use with text, simple line art
drawings or any other simple outline material.

When used with the type of image for which it was designed, however,
JPEG compression is a very effective tool, achieving compression ratios
of up to 20:1, with no perceptible loss of quality when the image is de-
compressed for on-screen viewing. Use of GIF on the same image would
obtain something in the region of 3:1 compression, or perhaps a little
better. With an image containing constant variations in colour, JPEG
would also produce a more realistic image on de-compression, whereas a
GIF de-compressed may show noticeable banding effects through its
failure to define colour change graduations adequately. JPEG has
another benefit, in that it is possible, in compressing an image for
presentation as part of a Web site, for example, to offset the quality
required in the application against the degree of compression applied.
Thus, if only a very low resolution is required in the final image, on
screen, compression ratios of up to 100:1 are available. If very high
resolution is required, by contrast, then compression may be limited to
much lower ratios. This helps to make JPEG a very flexible tool for the
Web developer.

The major downfall of JPEG on the Internet is that it is much less
widely-integrated into the software utilities, such as Web browsers,
which are used to 'unpack' images from their servers on the system.
Many highly effective JPEG viewers and utilities are available, even in
the freeware domain. However, other than Netscape and a few others,
most of the fundamental Internet tools require such JPEG viewers to be
configured separately, making the standard rather more clumsy for the
average Web or Internet user than GIF.

It should be borne in mind, however, that this position is not likely
to be static. There is increasing pressure within the Internet
community to greatly enhance the ability of the Internet to handle
transfers of graphical, audio and video information, and the more
advanced compression techniques are likely to be increasingly adopted
as part of the means to achieve this.

The future of online image handling

All the techniques described so far essentially employ similar
mathematical processes to achieve their compression effects. These rely
on re-defining the image, pixel-by-pixel, so as to reduce the amount of
data required to construct the image on screen on de-compression. Since
early 1996, a company called Iterated Systems has been making a wholly-
different compression/de-compression technology available to Internet
users. This may offer significant benefits in performance in comparison
with currently popular techniques, with the added advantage that
essentially the same technology can be adapted to process audio and
video data streams.

Iterated Systems, founded in 1987, has developed a compression
technology based in the use of advanced mathematical processes known as
fractal transforms. Data is compressed by identifying such formulae to
define recurring elements in the image, so that large areas of
repeating data can be replaced with the fractal definition, together
with codes to define position, colour, intensity and other necessary
parameters. Iterated is so confident of the quality of its technology
that it has publicly stated the goal of making its system the de facto
standard on the Internet, and in any other TCP/IP network systems, such
as corporate internal information networks (Intranets).

Fractal compression has already been widely adopted as a means of
efficient image storage and retrieval in CD-ROM applications. Among the
users in this environment have been Microsoft, in handling the 7,000
images in its Encarta encyclopedia along with other multimedia
encyclopedia developers such as Hutchinson and Grolier.

A typical fractal compression process would reduce a 2MB file to a
compressed form of about 40kB in size, representing a compression ratio
of approximately 50:1. According to Iterated, this would be comparable
in quality on de-compression with a JPEG file produced with a far lower
compression ratio. Hence the fractal technique potentially offers far
greater data transmission benefits and efficiency benefits, while
offering at least equivalent image quality to other methods, and some
interesting additional features.

By contrast with GIF and PNG, fractal image files (FIFs) load
differently when retrieved over a network. Instead of gradually
appearing in increasingly higher definition across the whole ultimate
area of the image, a FIF will appear first as a thumbnail-sized version
of the full image, at full definition, clearly showing the nature of
the image from the start. It will then gradually expand up to the full
size defined by the creator of the Web page. Additionally the file,
once retrieved, can be handled in a more versatile manner than de-
compressed files from other technologies. It is possible, for example,
to zoom into given areas of a FIF at much higher ratios than is
possible with a comparable JPEG image, without the blocky quality
introduced by the pixel-to-pixel boundaries in conventional images. It
is also readily possible to vary the colour depth of the image both
upwards and downwards after retrieval.

Iterated Systems has released as freeware a utility called Fractal
Viewer, which can be downloaded free of charge from its Web site. This
allows users to retrieve and de-compress FIFs from the Internet.
Fractal Viewer can be added as a plug-in to Netscape Navigator, the
popular Web browser, so that Netscape is able to retrieve FIFs
seamlessly from Web sites. At the same time the company has made
available a utility called CoolFusion, which handles video and audio
material in a similar fashion. This is also freeware and also able to
be integrated with the Netscape Navigator. For developers, an image
processing tool called Fractal Image is available commercially, along
with a shareware developers' kit.

CoolFusion is perhaps the most exciting of these tools. At present it
is not possible to comment on its effectiveness, since Iterated has yet
to release any fractal-compressed video material for evaluation.
However, if the levels of data compression predicted can be achieved,
then the technology of realtime video transmission over the Internet
may be brought a large step forward. Iterated's people currently talk
in terms of achieving realtime colour video transmission at data
transmission rates suitable for modem transmission. This currently
remains well beyond the scope of the most widely-used video compression
tools on the market - either MPEG (for Motion Picture Experts Group), a
distant cousin of JPEG, or Apple's QuickTime technology.

A key tool for the future of the Web

Until such a time as the whole Internet can guarantee data rates in the
64kbps range for every individual transaction, at least for Web
applications, compression technology offers the most promising route
for development of advanced data delivery systems such as sophisticated
graphics, voice telephony and full-motion video in realtime. Since the
timescale for the achievement of widespread high-bandwidth connectivity
is probably in years rather than months, it can be seen that any
organisation looking to be involved in sophisticated Web information
distribution should be fully conversant with the most appropriate
compression technologies available for its purposes. This article has
set out some of the current techniques, and pointed to one promising
area of development. It is likely that Internet for Business will
return to this theme frequently in future issues.

HOME OR AWAY - THE WEB SITE DILEMMA

A crucial decision facing any organisation planning to establish its
own information service, or site, on the World Wide Web is whether or
not to invest in the equipment, software and human resources necessary
to manage such a system in-house. The alternative, of placing the site
on a remote server, managed by a hosting service, may appear at first
sight to have disadvantages in loss of control, and to require payments
which have no capital benefit to the site developer. However, on closer
scrutiny, the matter is not so straightforward.

The costs involved in setting up a Web site on an in-house, managed
basis are likely to be in the order of #10,000 to #15,000 for hardware
and software alone, even at the entry level. To this must be added the
necessary Internet access, rental of which from a service provider will
be in a similar order to the hardware and software costs, in the first
year of operation.

If a full-time Web site operator is employed (traditionally known
somewhat onesidedly as a Webmaster), then a further outgoing in excess
of #20,000 per year should be envisaged. This leaves aside any question
of investing in security or firewall software, to protect the site from
unauthorised intrusion or attempts to use it as a means to break into
the organisation's network, if any.

In return for such investment, a Web site publisher will gain total
control over the site, including its efficiency of operation and
maintenance, the regularity of updating, and the types of access
allowed to one or more different categories of user. If the site is
connected to the internal LAN it will also be possible to use it as the
server for an Intranet, an information service for the organisation's
staff, using World Wide Web software and interfaces.

Hosting a Web site

However, the level of investment indicated above may seem a large jump
for any organisation, particularly among small businesses, if coming to
the Internet or Web for the first time. The alternative, which has
become increasingly popular in recent times, is to establish a Web
site, but to have it hosted on a remote computer, managed by, and
installed at the premises of a service company.

In this case, the owner of the site can still take direct control of
the appearance, content and functionality of the Web site, even
downloading updated direct on to the server by using a remote Internet
connection. However, the hosting organisation will take responsibility
for the Internet access required by the site, monitoring and
maintaining the function of the site, backing up its contents and
supervising the hardware. Equally, they will incur the capital costs
for the equipment and services needed.

The costs involved in this process are often extremely reasonable. A
typical service of this nature in the UK is offered by Cambridge-based
Internet systems integrators, Electric Mail. This company offers two
levels of Web hosting service, WebSpace and WebSpace Light. WebSpace is
the top-level service, offering users the ability to operate a Web site
on Electric Mail's servers, with its own discrete address (known in the
Internet field as a URL - Uniform Resource Locator). The basis charges
for this service would amount to approximately #1,000 over the first
year of operation, and somewhat less per year thereafter. WebSpace
Light, which registers an organisation's Web site as a sub-section
(known as sub-domain) of Electric Mail's own Web site, is available for
less than #200 per year.

Hosting in the UK and abroad

Most of the UK's leading Internet service providers will offer similar
hosting services, among them companies such as Unipalm Pipex and
PSINet. Similarly the same services are often available from Web
production companies such as London-based Webmedia. An identical
picture is seen, for example, in the US, where leading service
providers Netcom and UUNet offer identical or similar services. Very
often the detailed arrangements for Web site hosting are published by
these companies on their own Web sites, including scales of charges
levied.

The cost/benefit equation in establishing a Web site may well be tipped
heavily towards the outsourcing option, especially for smaller
companies or those embarking on experimental use of the Web. In-house
operation really only makes sense if a major site is contemplated,
fully-integrated with other information services operated by an
organisation, and requiring constant updating and supervision from the
organisation's own staff.

Web hosting services are readily available in the UK and the US, and
this is equally true across all the countries where commercial Internet
activity is gaining acceptance. Anyone contemplating creating a Web
site, whether commercially-orientated or otherwise, is well-advised to
give this option serious thought.

INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATIONS - THE INTERNET LEAP FORWARD

Out of the many disparate strands which are slowly emerging from the
commercial development and harnessing of the Internet, two levels of
practical and creative thinking may be isolated. One is the tendency
simply to take existing methods of communication and presentation of
information from media such as television and the printed word, and to
transfer them with little adjustment into Internet contexts such as the
Web.

Meanwhile more imaginative and possibly more risk-oriented developers
and implementers search for new information models which operate to
obtain the maximum return from the particular strengths of the Internet
medium. The momentum towards this latter approach is slowly building,
and numbers of companies are developing software which takes this style
away from a few informed insiders and into the field of systematic
application of available tools.

In truth the differentiation between the more conservative application
of traditional media approaches, and the exploration of new
communications paradigms, is rather to be seen as a spectrum between
two extremes, and not as a pair of incompatible options. Some
traditional media techniques work effectively over the Internet, after
all. However, as with the evolution of television or radio
broadcasting, the development of commercial communications over the
Web, for example, will assuredly tend towards new models which are most
effective in harnessing the medium. Insiders generally feel that this
process will take place far more rapidly than has been the case in
previous generations of media.

What then are the strengths identifiable for the Web, which perhaps
best exemplifies the Internet as a tool for interactive communications
between groups and individuals with commercial goals in view? It would
be rash to attempt to create an exhaustive list at this early stage in
the growth of the medium. However, a number of elements are already
clear:

1. Flexibility - one Web site, with suitable control over categories of
access, can serve a range of different audiences, such as company
staff, shareholders, customers, collaborators, distributors, the press,
government and official regulators and many more;

2. Adaptability - information on a Web site is open to frequent update
and focusing at relatively low cost, by comparison with traditional
methods such as printing.

3. Interactivity - properly configured, a Web site can allow a truly
balanced, two-way communication process, whereby various audiences can
receive messages from the site owner and respond with similar force and
precision. It is also possible to allow mutual interaction between the
various audiences which the site may address - between customers and
distributors, for example;

4. Immediacy - information can be uniquely tailored to the needs of
very narrowly-focused groups, and updated to match their changing
responses.

Up to second quarter 1996, many organisations which have launched Web
sites have failed to go beyond the creation of electronic billboards.
Information presented is essentially sales driven, relatively static
and offers little opportunity for users of sites to communicate or
interact. Web users in general tend not to respond positively to such
ponderous content, preferring to spend their time in surfing sites
which are far more active, interactive and fast-moving.

Some of the tools which allow companies to build such interest into Web
sites include:

1. Database interfacing software - allowing site visitors to search
company information relevant to their needs, and access the search
results through their own Web browser interface. These tools create
HTML pages dynamically according to the search results for the user,
meaning that the underlying database may be left in its natural
database environment, rather than being converted into HTML in total.

2. Intelligent agents - utilities which allow users to specify, once
and for all or on an ever-changing basis, a range of information types
from within a site's resources which are particularly relevant to their
interests or needs. The agent then delivers the relevant information as
a selection from the total content of the site (an interesting current
example is the Personal Times, the interactive version of The Times of
London, where users may define an information profile to confirm the
material from the overall structure of the newspaper which they wish to
see each day.)

3. Online forms - tools structured into the HTML mark-up of Web pages
to allow users to send information back to the Web site owner for
future reference.

4. Interactive offline discussion groups and online chat groups.
Increasingly used in sites relating to consumer marketing, especially,
these services allow communication, with or without some form of
moderation by the site owner, between users of the site, whether within
a particular group, such as current customers, or across groups, so
that, for example, customers are able to communicate with distributors,
retailers, or other groups using the site.

5. Online ordering and payment structures - the basic building blocks
of genuine online commerce.

6. Multimedia data-delivery software - allowing the presentation of
information through a Web site in audio, video and 3D forms.

Web communications defined

One of the terms heard with increasing frequency in this field of Web
communications is the word 'Pointcasting'. The major strength of
established media such as newspapers, radio and television has been
broadcasting, the distribution of one fixed message, or a small range
of fixed alternatives, to a large audience with defined commonalities
of interests. The Web moves away from this model to give the marketing
or corporate communications strategist a whole new toolkit.
Pointcasting is seen as the process of establishing messages which are
valid to individuals or small discrete interest groups of relevance to
the site owner, and the updating of these messages to continue their
relevance to those targets over time. Pointcasting relies on the
harnessing of tools such as those outlined in the previous paragraph,
to ensure that two-way communication is established between a Web site
creator and the individual users, at a constantly relevant and fruitful
level.

One company which has begun to create software applications which are
designed to address this technique in a simple, managed software
environment, is Silicon Valley start up BroadVision. Preferring to use
the term one-to-one marketing, rather than pointcasting, since its
offering focuses in the business development side of these new Web
techniques, BroadVision has launched a suite of software which will
underpin the development of these focused, interactive techniques in
the commercial Web environment. Called Broad-Vision One-to-One (tm),
this is a software system which is designed to manage the entire
marketing and selling life cycle on the Web. Four areas of
functionality are offered;

1. Community - the provision of dynamic information relevant to users,
not always focused directly on the site owners' products and services.
Interactive communication between users of the site is also delivered,
where appropriate. This aspect of the software is designed to build a
community of users, and deliver intrinsic benefits to them within the
structure of the site, encouraging their repeated use of the
information.

2. Profiling - data tracking utilities which allow the site owner to
form detailed knowledge of each individual relevant to the products and
services dealt with by the site. This will, for example, remember all
the transactions entered into by a given user, giving the site owner
useful profile details for design of further interaction with that
user.

3. Targeting - intelligent-agent style functions, allowing the sites
content to be delivered to individual users in a fashion which best
serves their short-term and long-term needs.

4. Transaction processing - electronic ordering and sales, customer
services, EDI, reporting etc.

This methodology bears comparison with traditional direct sales
techniques. Leading exponents of catalogue selling, for example, have
long improved their sales performance by maintaining extensive database
information regarding the tastes and buying habits of customers.
However, the Web is more powerful still, since it allows the marketing
professional to interact more frequently with a wider range of
audiences, and to develop a more detailed understanding of the needs
and wants of the individuals and companies' which buy their goods and
services.

Software such as that provided by BroadVision, which is one of a number
of providers in this field, allows non-technical staff of companies
seeking to harness Internet marketing techniques to have direct control
of the strategy and information content of the process. Such tools
promise to have a similar revolutionary effect in the Internet field as
did desktop publishing software in the print-on-paper communications
process. Once they are well-established, the whole process of marketing
on the Internet should be moved up a notch in terms of accessibility
and effectiveness.

SMALL BUSINESSES RELUCTANT TO JOIN WEB

O'Reilly Associates have published the results of their recent survey
Conducting business on the Internet. The full results are available for
purchase by contacting their Web site at www.ora.com.

The companies surveyed were drawn from the Dun and Bradstreet database
and divided into large, medium and small organisations. The response
rates upon which the results were collected were 410, 406 and 214
respectively. Large companies were classified as those with more than
1,000 employees, medium-sized companies with 101 to 1,000 employees and
small companies with less than 100 employees.

While the results indicated that 51% of large companies in North
America currently use the Internet, only 8% of small companies take
advantage of the network, and while a surprising 28% of large companies
plan no Internet access in the near future, this figure rises to 53%
for medium-sized and 79% for small companies.

Intranet activity was also monitored with 37% of large companies having
at least one internal Web site while external Web site activity was
registered with 35% of large companies.

PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE WORLD WIDE WEB

Latest figures from two of the world's leading research groups in the
high technology sector shed further light on the development of the
Web, and on the use of software designed to support access and
searching across this global data structure. Data released reveals the
continuing explosive growth of the Web as a means of publishing and
accessing data, and identifies clear winners and losers, up to the
present date, in the battle for dominance in software development for
Web browsers.

According to figures published by the International Data Corporation,
the total number of users of the Web, across all sectors, will reach
some 30 million or more during 1996 up from under 10 million in 1995.
These numbers are projected to reach well in excess of 120 million by
the close of the decade. In parallel with this growth, a shift in the
balance of the Web is forecast by IDC, with the percentage of Web users
worldwide being located in the US falling from nearly 80% in 1995 to
little over 50% at the end of 1999.

IDC's fellow research group Dataquest took advantage of the opportunity
provided by the Internet World show to announce a new service providing
market insights over the Internet delivered through the World Wide Web.
The service, entitled DQi (Dataquest Interactive), will offer high-
value quantitative analysis and news on the IT industry (the site
address is: http://www.dataquest.com). Of special interest to Internet
industry analysts during the Internet World event was a new breakdown,
published by DQi, of the use of various types of Web browser software
across the Internet sector. Statistics compiled by Dataquest were
obtained by monitoring the traffic on a wide range of Web sites which
publish statistics on numbers of accesses and the type of browser used
by each visitor to the site.

Using this basis for statistical analysis, Dataquest concludes that the
Netscape Navigator Web browser, in all its versions, remains the most
popular among Web users, with some 84% of all Web traffic being
generated by this browser. Netscape's nearest competitor in the Web
browser market is now the Microsoft Internet Explorer, which has just
7% of this market, although its user base is among the fastest growing
of all the Netscape alternatives. Other browsers listed include the
proprietary browser of America Online, with 3% of the market, and NCSA
Mosaic, the original graphical Web browser, whose various versions take
1% of the market. The remaining competitors take a further 5% between
them. Among this latter group, and with the highest growth rate of all,
is the Sun Microsystems Hot Java browser, developed to feature Sun's
Java online interactive programming environment.

Dataquest will continue to track the browser competition, and many
other measures of the Internet and computing sector, publishing regular
updates on the Web site launched at Internet World.

VIDEO NETWORKING TAKES A STEP FORWARD

General Instrument Corporation, a technology integrator for interactive
voice, video and data delivery over computer networks, announced a new
initiative in video-enriched interactive services in early May. GI, a
US-based multinational, is launching a programme known as Videoware
Innovation Partners, to establish key collaborations with other players
in the networking field for the delivery of its Videoware video-rich
data service over broadband networks. The GI system, in collaboration
with its VI Partners, will allow network operators to deploy a high-
speed turnkey system integrating hardware, network management, Internet
and intranet access and multimedia services.

Initially GI is concentrating on delivering services over its
proprietary SURFboard network, an end-to-end system delivering video
and data at 27Mbps to PCs equipped with its SURFboard adaptor cards.
This network structure depends on cable outward links, with a standard
telephone return path. Hence the return data feed operates at
narrowband data rates only. Nonetheless, the company's solution is one
which may be implemented immediately, over existing cable networks. GI
plans to launch a two-way broadband system, harnessing Asynchronous
Transfer Mode switching, based on the use of existing cable
infrastructure for both outward and return information.

Partners in the Videoware Innovation programme include America Online,
CompuServe, Dorling Kindersley Multimedia, Macromedia, Paramount
Pictures, Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and Turner Broadcasting
System.

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-DIFFICULT YEAR AHEAD FOR
ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

New research from TFPL says that 1996 is going to be
a difficult year for the new online service providers
who are expecting to cash in on the European service
market.  The study compares the European market model
to the USA and notes that the main US services such
as CompuServe, America Online and Prodigy have had
subscriber loyalty before the widespread use of the
Internet whereas in Europe service providers face
competition from the Internet as wekk as from free
public teletext services, videotex services and
localised online services.  Martin White, managing
consultant at TPFL, said: "Companies are tying to
take advantage of the rapidly growing installed base
of PCs in both the business and consumer markets
without fully understanding cultural issues about
information use. You only have to look at the way in
which the newspaper industry differs in each country
to see one example of the way in which online
services will have to adapt to each national market.
-- the evidence from the French Teletel services is
that users are more inclined to use the services for
transactions, rather than just for information."

RESCUE SERVICE
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Digital Equipment Corp's Multivendor Customer
Services business unit has introduced a new service
aimed at Internet users called the PC Rescue Service.
Subscribers will be given access to a dedicated
hotline where technicians will solve any Netscape or
Mosaic Internet access problems and any PC hardware,
software or peripheral problem for any major brand of
PC hardware and software, irrespective of what system
and network operating system used.  David Allen,
marketing director of Digital's MCS unit, said: "In
our most recent research we discovered that more than
one in four people had difficulties in learning to
use and understand computers -- many of these have
bought a PC to access the Internet. Fourteen percent
of people have also experienced major breakdowns and
systems crashes -- which proves the industry still
needs to provide comprehensive support and rescue
services like PC rescue, if we are going to continue
to have a satisfied and rapidly growing Internet user
community." Yearly subscription costs are GBP117.50
with calls charged at GBP20 per incident. Members who
join before March 1996, will receive 5 free calls -
making membership almost free.

Yet another new Internet service provider has gone
online, although this company claims to have a
different unique selling proposition to the rest.
Cable Online, a business unit of cable TV and
telephony service vendors CableTel, is planning to
leverage its business contacts within the cable
sector to provide Internet services over the regular
PSTN and cable phone networks around the UK.  The
company is confident of success and has claimed it
will be the number one Internet provider by the end
of 1997 with the key being its massive supply of
bandwidth, access points, scalable system and
support. Philip John, managing director of Cable
Online said: "In partnership with CableTel, we have
put our considerable telecomms resources and
expertise behind the service and placed great
emphasis on customer care.  We're confident that
disgruntled customers will move to us from other
service providers and that we will also attract a
healthy number of 'newbies'." Untimed service will be
charged at GBP12.95/month for dial-up access and free
technical support is offered on a toll-free number. A
number of local call points of presence are set to be
introduced with 90% UK local call penetration by mid-1996.
ISDN and leased line services are also being
offered although pricing information has yet to be
released.

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-MICROSOFT FACES HOSTILE
EUROPEAN RECEPTION AFTER EURO ONLINE VENDORS ALIGN
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Microsoft Corp's presently lacklustre plans to move
in the European online communications market with its
Microsoft Network seems to have been hit for six
after Germany's biggest media and telecommunications
companies joined forces with the world's largest
online services company to head off Microsoft.
Deutsche Telekom AG, Bertelsmann AG, Axel Springer
Verlag and America Online have signed letters of
intent to cooperate in online service provision and
operation. While not everything is yet cut and dry as
the proposal will require tight scrutiny from
Europe's competition watchdog, many observers point
out that the EU is likely to be favourable to the
deal in view of the threat from Microsoft Corp. 
While Internet service providers around Europe will
be marginally affected by the service, the new group
plans to introduce mainly content-based services,
placing it in direct competition with Microsoft's
Microsoft Network and CompuServe.  A complex range of
stock swapping is set to take place between the
partners to strengthen the deal. Possibly to placate
the watchdogs, the companies have stated that they
have no immediate intention to merge their own
extensive individual online services into one unit --
although of course they have denied to rule this out
as an option. Microsoft was also slated in a research
report note from Goldman Sachs claims that failure by
Microsoft to  articulate an Internet strategy' could
 ...weigh heavily on investors.' Goldman Sachs & Co.
cut its rating on the software giant.  Goldman has
removed Microsoft from its recommended list for top-rated stocks
and cut its rating from buy to moderate
outperformer. It is understood that the analyst cut
the stock because of Microsoft's failure to develop a
compelling Internet strategy which could dampen
upward movement in the stock during the next six
months, noting the expectation of an important
Internet strategy announcements from Microsoft in
about six months. Separately Microsoft has announced
that it has released the beta version of its
Microsoft Internet Information Server for Windows NT
-- more commonly known as Gibraltar -- to around
1,000 test sites worldwide and a second beta phase to
15,000 sites before a 1Q'96 launch.

SLOW TO TAKE-UP INTERNET
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

European retailers are failing to take advantage of
the real potential advantages of Internet-based
retail services such as remote shopping, promotions
and customer awareness, according to research carried
out by Cap Gemini Sogeti/Hoskyns. The survey polled
46 of the top 200 retailers across Europe, noting
that while 90% are already connected on to the
Internet or seriously considering its benefits, use
of the Internet differs between retail sectors. The
fashion industry, for example, is failing to see the
benefits while mail order and wholesale ventures are
booming. Marc Peters, retail sector manager at
Hoskyns, said that despite the perceived advances,
retailers are not yet utilising the full potential of
the Internet and that current interest is mainly
exploratory.  Most of the companies who are trialing
the Internet have low expectations, with half-percent
of turnover being the expected rate of return within
two years and four percent over 10 years.  The survey
polled users on the main perceived barriers to net
trading with too few users topping the list at 59%
followed by Internet users are not the target markets
(57%), concerns over financial security (43%) and
lack of delivery infrastructure (39%). Separately,
telecommunications companies are failing to make the
most of the Internet's WWW despite being at the
forefront of most technical developments -- that is
the claim of a new survey conducted for Wollongong
Group. Wollongong polled 300 businesses and
discovered it was only the IT industry sector which
sees real commercial benefits from the Internet's
WWW. The survey, when split into industry sectors,
noted that while 30% of respondents were from IT
firms, only 8% where from telecommunications-related
companies.

ELECTRONIC MAIL ACCESS
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

A call has been made by the Rand Corp in a new study
for all Americans to be given equal access to
electronic mail. Rand says that private and
government policy makers should work together to
bring all Americans -- irrespective of income -- onto
the information superhighway, enabling them to reap
the considerable benefits over time.  Rand highlights
what it says is a growing number of  information
elite' parties which is made up of well-off
individuals with access to computers that can
transmit and receive e-mail.  According to Rand: "As
e-mail becomes more pervasive, as more commercial and
government transactions in the United States take
place online, those information haves may leave the
have-nots further behind, unless we make concerted
efforts today to provide all citizens with access to
the technology."  Amongst the ideas passed by Rand
for getting the less well-off onto e-mail are
recycling of old (lower specification) computers and
associated software should be readily encouraged
along with the proliferation of public access
terminals, possible operating in the same vein as a
payphone.

Corporate security staff are still concerned over the
use of the Internet for commercial purposes,
according to the third annual Ernst & Young
Information Security Survey.  Over half of the US
firms polled reported security-related financial
losses in the past year with 20 companies reporting
losses in excess of US$1m.  Out of the firms who had
grasped the nettle and gone online, 20% reported that
an intruder had successfully or nearly successfully
breached security systems.  The overall level of
Internet security came under fire from 40% of users
who said they were dissatisfied with the inherent net
security and 87% of firms said that they would make
greater use of the Internet for corporate purposes if
the security was improved. Candidly, most companies
admitted that they do not have adequate tools or
properly trained personnel to defend against
information security losses. The report surveyed
1,300 chief information officers and other senior
information executives. Other interesting findings
included that over 66% of sites encountered a
computer virus in the past year, a rise in the number
of security precautions taken and greater
introduction of security tools. Ernst & Young has
also reported that one out of every five companies
connected to the Internet has reported an attempted
or a successful break-in to their company's network
in the past year and that 65% of firms gave been
affected by a computer virus. A financial loss was
only experienced in a  small portion' of companies
hit by intruders of all kinds. Ernst & Young said
that 66% of its respondents who are not using the
Internet now and 83% of respondents who plan to
within the next year, said they would use the
Internet for more business purposes if security was
enhanced.

issues such as network security, Internet access and
NetWare migration.   A number of free and trial

for subsequent use.  Dan Metcalfe, managing director
of LAN Software Direct claims that network and IT
administrators have been calling for such a service
for a long time even though most of the information
can already be found on the Internet and online
services such as CompuServe. "Network administrators
have been demanding a service like LAN Software
Direct for some time.  Networks are growing in size
and complexity but management resources remain
static.  Administrators need products which will
automatically manage certain elements of the network
and at the same time boost LAN  productivity. Most
managers do not have the time to research and test

them down, rape a 12-year-old girl and kill them. The
19-year-old alleged perpetrator has been arrested at

that the activity was viewed as a prank by the
accused.  Court papers reveal that a user under the

12-year-old was having on 21 October on  the Internet
with a 13-year-boy from Toronto and after a few
innocuous questions about age, the accused allegedly
wrote that he wanted to sodomize her. The father of
the young girl intervened online and ordered the
accused to desist, only to receive e-mail littered
with sexually offensive messages which escalated into
threats including claims that he had HIV and would
infect the girl. A hearing has yet to be made.

COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

NETCOM ON-LINE COMMUNICATION SERVICES INC has been
advised by Prodigy Services Co that it is allegedly
engaging in deceptive advertising in some of its
packaging and marketing materials for its US Internet
service. Netcom claims that the materials relate to
certain price comparisons between Prodigy's online
service and Netcom's Internet access service, which
are marked by Netcom to show pricing information as
of 24 February 1995. Prodigy says that it reduced its
pricing on April 1995 and that Netcom was aware of
the price cuts although its continued use of the
material constitutes deceptive advertising.   Netcom
says that it is investing the claims although it does
not believe that it will be adversely affected by any
action.

REALITY MAY CATCH UP TO HYPE THIS YEAR
Opportunities Abound, But So Does Competition and Consolidation

      Overall, growth in the Internet marketplace will not slow in
1996. 
      Net software firms will barrel into the new year fueled by
product introductions that will dominate the first half of the year.
Internet service providers will continue to expand their networks at a
breakneck pace, and new content providers will enter the marketplace
with ever richer multimedia content featuring 3-D, audio, and video.
      But despite the opportunities that such growth represents, the
Internet industry also will show signs of growing up this year. The
number of firms racing onto the Net will slow somewhat from 1995
levels as companies struggle to justify the expense of their sites. 
      Despite this slight slowdown, last year's hype about the Net
will continue to draw more competitors into the access and software
businesses, sharply increasing the amount of competition and leading
to an industry shakeout. Increased competition also will spark the
often-predicted access wars as Internet service providers vie with
telcos and cable firms to capture market share. Competition also will
inspire firms to consider introducing proprietary applications that
work with the Net's open systems to capture customers.

Will Open Standards Survive?

      Although the Net has always been based on open systems, the race
to get a competitive edge has encouraged firms to introduce and
implement new specifications long before standards bodies or other
industry members can evaluate them. Firms with sufficient marketing
muscle and innovative ideas have set de facto standards. To keep up,
others have begun incorporating the standards -- sometimes before the
specifications are even available to the public.
      "No one is waiting for final specifications to begin
incorporating new capabilities into their products," said Stratton
Sclavos, president of VeriSign. "We can adapt to final specifications;
we can't wait around for them to emerge."
      Since many firms -- most notably Netscape Communications Corp.
-- have benefitted from this practice, many plan to copy the strategy
in 1996 -- something that could lead to a confusing jumble of possible
standards introduced in 1996, warn industry experts. Inevitably, some
firms will back the wrong standards.
      But an even bigger threat to open systems are the increasing
number of application programming interfaces (APIs) that are popping
up. Offering an API encourages firms to adapt to a particular
technology that may or may not be open, said Gary Eichhorn, CEO of
Open Market.
      Many suspect that Microsoft Corp. will use that strategy to
capture a large portion of the Internet market, even though the firm
has pledged to use open standards. "I don't really see Microsoft
participating in the open systems, cross-platform environment," said
John Patrick, vice president of Internet technology for IBM. 
      Despite the fears, many major firms have renewed their
commitment to open standards, which should ensure that the openness of
the Net will survive at least another year.

Partner, Partner Everywhere

      The quickest way to get ahead in the Internet business is to
partner with -- or acquire -- a company with a promising technology.
As a result, partnerships will continue to drive much of the Internet
market in 1996, and mergers and acquisitions will be on the rise as
firms try to buy into the Internet market.
      "We expect to see a lot of mergers and acquisitions activity in
the market, and, of course, partnerships will continue to drive the
market," said Mary Pat McCarthy, partner and national director for
software and services practice at KPMG Peat Marwick. "There will be
some alliances you would never expect."
      IBM will actively seek partners for everything from simple
marketing agreements to possible technology acquisitions. "We want to
show how well we can work with others," said IBM's Patrick. Most other
major firms plan to pursue a similar strategy.

Consolidation Continues

      However, partnerships won't be enough to save some firms. Every
software firm in the country is expected to jump into the Internet
market with some product in 1996. Yet few have clear plans for how to
compete in the market or even in what products to develop. "Software
firms don't have a clear strategy and no one knows what it should be
doing on the Net," said KPMG's McCarthy. "Companies are vying for
positions and everyone is trying to cover their bets without knowing
what the successful strategy will be." 
      As a result, many firms could get burned. "I think there will be
continued consolidation in the software industry, and it will be
harder for small companies to survive unless they have a strong niche
or staying power," said McCarthy. "Large firms will continue to gobble
up small ones, and there will be a lot of jockeying in the Internet
and web arena."
      One of the main Internet software areas to take a hit will be
the browser market, predicted Laura Hanny, an analyst with First
Albany-META Technology Research. Hanny asserted that Netscape will
lose its market dominance in 1996 as other firm's browsers become more
widely available. The integration of browsers into software packages
as the ubiquitous client could further shake Netscape's leadership
position, she said. 
      However, that may not matter, since few firms will ever profit
from the sale of browsers. "Everyone agrees that browsers will become
commodities," explained Gaston Bastiaens, CEO of Quarterdeck.
      But the software market isn't the only one to face consolidation
in 1996, according to the Yankee Group. Internet service providers
(ISPs) also will feel the pinch as long distance firms, local telcos,
and cable firms begin to offer access (see related story on page 3).
The Yankee Group predicts that the number of ISPs will drop from
around 1,400 to 600 in 1996. In 1997, the firm predicts the number of
providers will plummet to less than 300.
      Content providers and service firms also will feel the pinch,
added Yankee Group analysts.
      In fact, the only firms that seem immune to consolidation are
the hardware and chip manufacturers. These businesses can expect to
see sales increase as demand rises for existing products and new
products -- such as so-called dumb terminals or browser boxes -- are
introduced.
      Quarterdeck's Bastiaens believes that the home computing market
will take off, boosting penetration from 37 percent of homes today to
65 percent by 1999. However, although growth will come from home
users, he asserted that the money will still come from corporate
markets.

IPO Mania

      But even a predicted industry consolidation won't be able to
dampen the financial market's enthusiasm for Internet stocks -- at
least not in the short term, said Hanny. Expect to see a rush of
Internet firms going public this year.
      "The market is a frenzied environment and it is very chaotic.
Many clients are talking about going public," said KPMG's McCarthy. 
      "Firms want to ride the craziness while it lasts and while they
can raise money," said Hanny. "We expect to see a lot of IPOs next
year."

Legal Troubles Brewing

      Experts also expect to see a lot of lawsuits next year. Several
cases, including Statton Oakmont vs. Prodigy and the Church of
Scientology vs. NETCOM (see Internet Week's May 29 and December 4
issues and a related brief on page 4), have set some precedents, and
attorneys expect that more lawsuits will be filed this year.
      In particular, copyright and trademark infringement suits are
likely to become more commonplace as firms struggle to protect
intellectual property on the Net, says Doug Wood, executive partner of
Hall Dickler Kent Friedman & Wood, a New York law firm. The number of
libel and slander cases also is expected to increase.
      Besides legal actions, 1996 will probably see some laws enacted
as well. Congress is unlikely to leave the Internet alone, and its
continued attempts to legislate privacy and pornography could cause
problems for many Internet firms. Also, the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), which has already begun monitoring the Internet for deceptive
advertising claims, is expected to beef up its efforts in 1996 and
make Internet advertising a major priority, say FTC sources. Other
government agencies also will monitor web sites for infringement in
areas of their jurisdiction.

Uncovering Opportunity

      Despite potential legal tangles and industry consolidation, more
firms are expected to jump on the Net. New products, delivered in the
first half of 1996, will help these firms expand their web sites
beyond simple advertisements into real tools to expand sales and cut
costs while improving customer service. In short, experts believe that
the Internet industry will deliver solutions rather than just hype in
1996. These solutions will spell opportunity for many.
      "There remains a significant opportunity to help firms establish
a presence on the web -- especially in other countries around the
world," said IBM's Patrick. "Firms will realize that just having a
page or an ad on the Net is just the tip of the iceberg. Business
applications will be added, and more firms will bring Net technology
inside the network."
      As this takes place, companies will need to improve the way they
manage information -- opening the door for consultants and integrators
as well as software firms, added Patrick.
      Meanwhile, the often-hyped but little-shopped electronic
shopping malls also will become more popular in 1996, especially when
firms update their approaches and security solutions become more
widespread. "They are using models of the past, and it's not working.
Retailers need to rethink their approaches rather than just putting a
paper catalog online," said Hanny. The widespread introduction and
acceptance of electronic payment methods will further boost sales (see
related story on page 2). When tied into exchange systems, worldwide
commerce will begin to take off, with many sales going to Japan.
      With sales going global, many firms will rethink the way they
serve overseas markets, while others will rush to expand into Europe,
Asia, and Latin America. Already, ISPs have pushed into Europe,
followed by the online services and other content providers. Netscape
established several overseas offices in 1995, as did Quarterdeck. That
trend will continue as more firms expand overseas.
      While some firms expand geographically, others will concentrate
on increasing their market presence in the U.S. Experts believe that
an Internet industry marketing blitz is coming, goaded by increased
competition. Already Digital Equipment Corp. has begun running
Internet-related TV ads, while Net ad space in the Wall Street Journal
continues to fill several pages.
      Competition also will drive firms to differentiate their
products and services and hone their marketing messages. IBM plans to
emphasize its ability to deliver complete solutions, while Open Market
will tout the security options and other features of  its server
software. Targeting niches will continue to be popular.
      Other firms will seek new products to help differentiate
themselves. Quarterdeck has heavily invested in collaborative
computing solutions. Although the webification of Lotus Notes could
stunt some of the market potential, collaborative computing is
expected to be hot in 1996 and beyond.
      "Imagine being able to cut travel time and expenses by having
telephone conferences that cost next to nothing since you are using
the Internet," said Bastiaens. Quarterdeck plans to introduce its
voice conferencing and document sharing software in 1996.
      Also expected to debut in 1996 are the so-called browser boxes
or dumb terminals. Although the market is hot on the idea, VeriSign's
Sclavos cautions that encryption and other security solutions must be
incorporated for the technology to really become useful. Sclavos
expects encryption chips to emerge in the next 12-18 months that will
help add security to such "dumb" terminals, which could help drive
their popularity. 
      "I think browser boxes are a wonderful concept. In the next six
months, we expect to see demos showing how they will work, but I think
they may have problems meeting the price point without running into
power management and security issues," he said. "They will have to
have security for people to use them.
      "It will be noteworthy to see if $500 is a good cutoff point,"
said KPMG's McCarthy. "Is that too expensive with some people? I see
prices coming down. I also think the baseline computer price will go
down over time, offering competition for the boxes."
      Meanwhile, 1996 will see Java going beyond the simple,
animation-type applications that it is currently being used for to
power real business applications. Java applets will power more
interactive applications on the web and will enable firms to offer
valuable information and services. By the end of the year, most
browsers will support Java, and Java applications will become
commonplace, predicts IBM's Patrick. IBM licensed Java from Sun in
December.

SECURITY MARKET TO BOOM TO '96:  AUTHENTICATION, ENCRYPTION,
ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS WILL BE WIDELY DEPLOYED THIS YEAR

      Security breaches made headlines in 1995. In 1996, security
solutions will make inroads into everyday workings of business and
lives of consumers as encryption, digital signatures, and
authentication systems become ubiquitous in server and client software
packages, say industry executives and analysts.
      "1995 was a great year for security. [Security] went from being
talked about by cryptographers at security conferences to becoming a
common topic in financial and Internet conferences and talked about by
businesses," said Stratton Sclavos, president of VeriSign. "In 1996,
you will see security solutions moving from the realm of specification
debates and political jockeying about protocols to being actually
rolled out."
      Such widespread deployment of security solutions will accelerate
the acceptance of electronic commerce and make doing business online
more commonplace, predicted John Patrick, vice president of Internet
applications for IBM [IBM]. "In 1996, we will see the beginning of a
new level of trust and understanding about authentication and
encryption. This will bring the next major round of growth, fueling
major growth in electronic commerce," he said. 
      To help consumers become more comfortable with online
transactions, banks and credit card companies plan to launch an
education campaign in the spring. The campaign will encourage
consumers to shop and bank online and will assure them that security
standards (especially those proposed by Visa and MasterCard [4823Z])
will protect credit card numbers and other information.
      Meanwhile, software firms are expected to incorporate electronic
payment modules into both client and server software packages by
midyear. Initially, most will focus on credit card payment methods,
with cash and check systems catching up late in 1996 or early in 1997,
say analysts. This could allow other solutions to enter the race,
although those with existing products will continue to be regarded as
market leaders, they say.
      But although secure payment methods will continue to receive the
most attention, consulting and intranet solutions are expected to
generate the most revenues.
      Many security experts believe that consulting will provide one
of the biggest opportunities for the security market in 1996. Besides
helping clients implement security solutions, consultants also will
help them develop security policies and procedures -- something many
firms don't have. "Having a set of policies and procedures in place to
authenticate users is critical for setting up a network security
system," said Sclavos. VeriSign plans to introduce a formal consulting
branch this year (the firm already provides consulting to clients).
Meanwhile, firms such as IBM and others with existing consulting
businesses will reap the benefits of their service.
      Deploying firewalls and user authentication systems within
company networks also will be lucrative in 1996 as firms begin using
web technology internally for a wider variety of tasks. At the same
time, public/private keys will begin replacing passwords for network
access, predicted Sclavos.
      Meanwhile, security vendors also will introduce longer
encryption keys. Sclavos predicts that 128-bit encryption keys will be
replaced by 256-bit keys in the next two years. Authentication keys
will grow from 1,024 bits to 2,048 bits.
      The security market's opportunities will continue to draw
competitors. Sclavos expects competition to heat up this year when the
U.S. Post Office, IBM, MasterCard, and Visa join VeriSign in the
public key certificate management business. But VeriSign welcomes
these firms into the market. "When public keys are enabled in all
browsers and servers, tracking the keys will be a big job," he said.
"We think there is room for competition." 

E-data Takes Action, Offers Licenses

      E-data Corp. is negotiating licenses with eight companies and
has notified 32 others that they are violating its patent. E-data
holds the Freeny patent, an electronic distribution technology for
audio, video, software, and other digital data. The company has
targeted more than 100 firms for infringement. IBM [IBM] received a
license in September; other firms are negotiating terms. For more

ACCESS:  PHONE COMPANIES BEGIN DIVING INTO THE INTERNET
Several Major Players Poised to Roll Out Service in Early 1996

      By the end of 1996, there will be at least one telephone company
competing for a share of the Internet access business in every major
U.S. market. Long distance companies won't be the only ones taking on
Internet service providers (ISPs) in the access business; most local
telcos plan to push into the market place this year. 
      The newest telco to enter the access market is GTE Intelligent
Network Services (GTEINS), a GTE Corp. subsidiary. Last week, GTEINS
introduced a dial-up and dedicated line Internet access service called
GTE.net. Dial-up rates are $8.95 for five hours of access (additional
hours cost $1.95 each) or $24.95 for unlimited access. 
      The firm will provide its customers with Netscape Communications
Corp.'s [NSCP] Netscape Navigator browser (thanks to a licensing
agreement between the firms) as part of the package, and it is beta
testing Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Information Server (code-named
Gibraltar) and Internet Studio Visual Publishing System authoring tool
(code-named Blackbird). GTEINS already offers the service in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area and plans to expand service nationwide by the
end of the year. GTEINS is part of GTE's long distance branch.
      Meanwhile, local carriers also are starting to move into the
field. Bell Atlantic plans to begin offering access in the
Washington-Baltimore area in February, and other local carriers are
not far behind. 

Planning to Take Over

      Speaking as if they already owned the access business, senior
telco executives discussed plans for the Net at, "Building the Optimum
Business Model: Telcos Providing Internet Access and Services," held
Dec. 13-14 by International Communications for Management (ICM) in
Washington D.C. 
      Local telcos are already gunning for the ISPs. Douglas Bulleit,
chief strategist at BellSouth, referred to ISPs as "interlopers,
laying on the public network, getting fast packet on one side, slower
dial-up on the other, and doing remarketing." 
      Bell Atlantic Media Ventures President Robert Beran predicted
that ISPs will have to get used to the fact that local and long
distance carriers will provide the bulk of access in the future. "The
big gorillas are getting into the game," said Beran.
      Telco executives see themselves as obvious providers of access
services because they consider Net access to be essentially the same
thing as voice telephony and believe customers feel the same way. Jeff
Cragan, director of new business development at Pacific Bell Internet
Services, cited a company survey which found that 87 percent of
residential customers would be interested in obtaining Internet access
through their local telephone company. 
      Telco executives also believe they have an infrastructure
advantage since their networks are designed to aggregate traffic at
their own switching points instead of at a server placed on the
network by one of their customers. This view could mean that the
recent struggle between Bell Canada and its ISP customers (see
Internet Week's Dec. 4 issue) over traffic levels may repeat itself in
the U.S.

Taking on Telcos

      This trend worries some in the ISP industry, since the access
providers will soon have to compete with the supplier of its product.
However, not all ISPs fear the entry of telcos into the market. "It's
a question of how well they can do it. They have the basic network
infrastructure to provide service, but how good is the service going
to be?" asked Brian Muys, a PSINet spokesman. Muys pointed out that
existing offerings from Sprint and MCI have not "taken the market by
storm," and he maintained that there are differences between providing
voice service and Internet access.
      "The way [the telcos] are approaching it is kind of 'we're
already in the phone business, and Internet is a no-brainer for us,'
but it's not that easy to be a good Internet provider," said Muys.
"They may provide adequate service, but when it comes down to
providing the tech support, keeping the network up, and keeping the
customers happy, I think there's going to be a longer learning curve
for the telephone companies than they would anticipate."
      GTEINS disagrees. Bob Zinnel, director of network operations for
GTEINS, said that although the businesses are not identical, the core
competencies in telephony will help the firm provide Internet access.
"The infrastructure we're putting in place is sized and planned for
the same kind of quality assurance we planned into the telephone
networks," said Zinnel. "Reliability is high on our list -- no
customer busy signals, no customer outages, no degradation in speed --
all those things had to be taken into consideration in our offering."
      Zinnel also points out that the people staffing the GTE.net
project came from GTE's internal data network group that ties the
company's dispersed operations together -- something that includes
significant experience in IP networking.
      In addition, Zinnel says, "We have an advantage in the billing
and backend operations, since that infrastructure is already in place.
Our telephone operation issues millions of phone bills per month.
That's one of the things that's killed off some of the smaller ISPs.
Once the user base gets to a certain level, they just can't keep up
with the billing."
      If the Internet is such a natural place for phone companies to
be, why haven't they been involved all along, and why have they chosen
this particular time to move into the field? One reason: Telcos are
notoriously conservative, and making money on the Internet has been a
speculative proposition until recently.

Profits Provide Motivation

      That is changing, however, and telcos have come to see the
Internet as a potential profit center. "Internet services will provide
the RBOCs [Regional Bell Operating Companies] a new high-growth source
of revenue in a business with attractive margins," said Pete Renner,
vice president, business information and advanced communications at
NYNEX Entertainment and Information Services.
      However, Renner and others pointed to another driving force
sending telcos into the Internet arena: the rapid approach of local
loop competition, which will pit local carriers, long distance
carriers, and the cable industry against each other in a multibillion
dollar, life-or-death struggle. In this kind of environment, even
something as big as the Internet is ultimately important as a
defensive weapon. "This will keep people on the NYNEX network," said
Renner. 
      Bell Atlantic's Robert Beran agreed that telcos have to be on
the Net if they want to remain industry leaders. Their customers are
demanding access, and they must be able to compete with other carriers
who will offer it if they don't. "We have to do this to retain our
customer base," said Beran.

Grand Strategy

      Each of the telcos' Internet strategies are similar and break
Internet opportunities into the general categories of access, content
provision, and hosting customer sites. 
      GTE.net, like most of the local carriers, will offer access,
along with a package of hosting and content development services for
business customers. "We do not plan to get into content development
per se," said Fred Walters, GTEINS' director of business and product
development. "But where there are applications where we see an unmet
market need, then we will become a content developer to serve that
market." Walters cited several vertical market segments, such as
education, where the firm may offer content.
      Although Farouk Hussein, MCI's senior manager of international
Internet marketing, described content as an "unstable" business at the
moment, most telcos see content as an eventual opportunity since
content can help telcos differentiate their services in the market.
Proprietary content will not be part of most initial service roll
outs, however. Both Bell Atlantic's Robert Beran and NYNEX's Pete
Renner said their companies will begin as simple access providers and
will develop their content strategies as they go. Beran said Bell
Atlantic likely will start by providing hotlinks to content, along
with a search tool. NYNEX has begun moving existing content, such as
its yellow pages, onto the Net. The firm debuted its Internet Yellow
Pages last year.
      Hosting web sites provides another opportunity, although it is
still not a big profit center for most firms, said AT&T's [T] David
Hughart. "It is probably breaking even and will eventually make
money," he added.
      That leaves access as the big money maker, and telcos plan to
squeeze it for profits while they can.

Turning on the Meter

      Telcos have demonstrated a strong preference for measured
access. Although Internet users prefer flat rates, providers have
learned that flat rates bring more difficulties than they solve. Users
occasionally interpret "unlimited access" literally and leave a
connection up continuously. The result is strain on the network and
impaired service quality for other users who begin to encounter busy
signals when dialing in.
      Although MCI's Hussein claimed MCI had found that only a very
small fraction of users will do this, other carriers maintain that it
is impossible to offer flat rate access and provide quality service.
Pacific Bell's Jeff Cragan said his company learned this lesson when
it tried to provide flat rate ISDN service earlier this year. Enough
users left connections "nailed up" that Pacific Bell eliminated flat
rate access.
      GTEINS, which does offer flat rate access, has established a
policy to deal with those that abuse the unlimited service. "In our
end-user contract, dial-up access is exactly that. It was meant to be
dialed up access," said Walters. "If we find that a customer is on 24
hours a day, then we're going to ask them to move to one of our
dedicated access services."
      Walters said that GTEINS does not have a predefined figure above
which usage would be considered excessive. Instead the company will
handle this on a case by case basis. 

Prodigy Appeal Denied

      In a ruling last week, New York State Judge Stuart Ain
reasserted his opinion that Prodigy Services Co. was a publisher,
rather than a common carrier. The decision opens the door for future
lawsuits against firms that allow users to post messages on
newsgroups, bulletin boards, or other online forums. In his opinion,
Judge Ain stated the need for a precedent as his reason for upholding
the earlier ruling.
      Judge Ain had made the original ruling in May when investment
banking firm Stratton Oakmont filed a lawsuit against the online
service provider. Stratton Oakmont later dropped the suit when Prodigy
agreed to apologize for an incident in which someone allegedly libeled
the firm on one of Prodigy's bulletin boards. The judge found that
since Prodigy passed messages through a filter to screen out obscenity
and derogatory terms, it exercised editorial control over the material
and therefore could be charged with libel. 
      Last week, Prodigy also acquired an interest in SonicNet, a web
site offering rock and music content owned by Sunshine Interactive
Network. Funding came from Prodigy's Wildflower Partners division,
which supports Internet-based content providers. SonicNet will provide
Prodigy with original, exclusive content as part of the deal. Prodigy
will provide support as well as funds for additional staff members.

CONTENT:  DIRECTORY SERVICE CHANGES STRATEGY TO COMPETE
555-1212.com Targets Niche, Locks in Area Codes as Domain Names

      When Jeff Field began surfing the Net last February, he couldn't
find an online directory that offered information about local
businesses. So he decided to create one.
      Launched in October, the directory, called 555-1212.com, was
designed to be a cross between a yellow pages directory and Yahoo!, a
popular Internet directory. By listing companies under their telephone
area codes, as well as more than 8,000 categories, Field hoped to
provide additional online information about companies -- especially
ones like hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, and services -- that
web surfers couldn't find anywhere else.
      "There's one site (http://www.thelist.com) where you can go and
find a list of ISPs broken down by area codes. We think that's a
useful service in itself, but we also want to do the same for hotels,
movie theaters and such," Field said. By using the popular telephone
information number as the name for his service, he believes the
directory's URL will be easy to remember and will draw visitors.
      To lock in that advantage, Field registered every telephone area
code, plus 555-1212.com, as a domain name. This will allow web surfers
to find businesses in their area quickly by typing in the familiar
telephone information number -- something that could prove a major
competitive advantage as local phone companies put phone directories
online.
      But despite that coup, competing with those services  has been a
challenge, forcing Field to change his strategy.

Change Is Inevitable

      As it was originally conceived, 555-1212.com would have no
advertising and minimal graphics. To generate revenue, Field planned
to charge companies for listings on the site. He thought businesses
would pay $5 for a 2-line listing and $10 for a link to a home page or
ad page. Although the model is popular with yellow pages -- which the
directory is modeled after -- it proved unsuccessful on the Internet.
Field found that firms were reluctant to pay for a listing offered to
them free by competitors such as Lycos and Yahoo!. Now basic listings
are free.
      Basic listings allow businesses to include their names in three
subject categories and two different area codes. Field charges an
additional fee for listings in extra categories or area codes.
      555-1212.com allows the companies to select the categories they
are represented in. Field said he was disappointed with how other
search services handle their listings. "It took me nearly three weeks
to get listed on Yahoo! and when I did get listed, the tagline was
very different from the one I supplied," he said. Yahoo! has since
changed the way it handles listing requests.
      But since it is not charging for listings, 555-1212.com had to
begin selling sponsorships to generate revenue. Although it uses the
traditional sponsorship style, sponsors' graphics are smaller than on
other sites, since Field believes graphics slow performance.
      Although this new business model more closely resembles that of
search tools such as Yahoo!, WebCrawler, and Lycos, Field emphasized
he is not trying to compete with those services. Instead, he describes
his creation as between NYNEX's Yellow Pages and Yahoo!. "I didn't
start out with the intention of making a telephone directory," said
Field. "I just wanted to make it easy to find a local business using
the Net."

Building It Up

      Since the site has only been online a few months, its directory
is still sparse. Field said this will not keep visitors from returning
to the site because they will see the value of his simplified format.
Nevertheless, "our number one priority is getting content," Field
said. "I may not have the content at the moment, but I have ease of
use and a familiar name."
      To fill the directory, Field will initially concentrate on
California's 408, 415, and 510 area codes. He said studies show that a
large percentage of Internet users are based in those regions and
would  likely use the service.
      Although he is actively seeking content, Field is relying on the
speed and ease of use of the directory to draw users. So far he has
shunned the complex graphics and content features of other
directories, saying they slow users down. "I want to get people their
information and get them on their way," he said.
      Once he has built up the number of listings, he thinks that
555-1212.com will become "invaluable as the Internet's business
directory."

THE 1990s:  DECADE OF CONVERGENCE

     As we move into the 1990s, companies are gearing up for the
convergence of various ISDN products along with the networks.
ISDN users, stranded on "islands" for the time being, are peering
across the vast spaces that separate the different switching
products and are beginning to build the pylons to connect these
islands.
     These pylons are represented as international ISDN standards
that have been adopted along with implementors' agreements being
cultivated by various companies.  These implementor agreements or
confidentiality agreements with developers and various companies
are often only hinted at in the various interviews we have had of
late.
     Make no mistake about it:  Vendors, RBOCs, and resellers are
jockeying for position and working on strategic alliances.
Everyone seems to have an ISDN laboratory either in the planning
stages or newly opened to test their equipment with that of
developers.
     Less then 2 years ago, the laboratory work was being
delegated to Bellcore, BNR in Canada, and AT&T Labs in
Naperville, Ill.  Then the RBOCs, first Southwestern Bell,
decided they needed their own private testing laboratories.
     Northern Telecom is also a player with major testing
facilities in North Carolina and Texas, not to mention its
affiliation with BNR in Canada.
     Even the consulting firms such as Andersen Consulting (ISDN
NEWS, Dec. 6, 1989, p. 2) are offering laboratories for the
testing of ISDN services as well as for the development of
applications.  Just recently, Hayes Microcomputers has added its
laboratory in Atlanta to the growing list of testing facilities.
     The development of these laboratories across the United
States and Canada illustrates the importance of applications
development along with the integration of systems and switches.

Standards organizations are cooperating

     The Consultative Committee on International Telegraph and
Telephone (CCITT), sponsored by the United Nations and located in
Geneva, Switzerland, has been making advances for the last year
toward other regional standards bodies.  These include the NIU-
Forum and others stressing the need for working together and not
duplicating efforts.
     Speculation is that the CCITT is concerned about its future
role in the standards implementation process because regional
standards bodies are proliferating rapidly, meet more frequently,
and can implement changes more quickly.
     Other standards groups are also forming alliances.  The
Corporation for Open Systems (COS) and its European counterpart,
the Standards Promotion and Applications Group (SPAG), have also
begun to form alliances with each other as well as their Japanese
counterpart, the Promoting Conference for OSI (POSI).  Australia,
of course, has a users' group supported by Telecom Australia, and
Canada has just formed a users group.   These affiliations around
the globe are heralding the 1990s as "The Decade of Convergence."
     Studies have indicated that these early days for ISDN
include only 1/10 of one percent of the telephone lines in the
United States.  The RBOC trials and commercial services updated
this month in ISDN NEWS indicate extensive growth at Bell
Atlantic and U S West in the United States.
     From the United Kingdom, Ovum Ltd. reports that 50,000 ISDN
lines will be equipped for data by 1990, 280,000 in 1991, and
800,000 in 1992.  These ISDN lines will have to be interoperable
to meet their full potential.
     Dennis Hayes, president and co-founder of Hayes
Microproducts, told ISDN NEWS that the United States is on the
"verge of 5 years of ISDN" and predicts significant growth in
ISDN in the next 5-7 years.  He expects it will take the same
amount of time for the ISDN market to mature as it did the
videotape player market.
     If the standards, applications, and interoperability testing
is being stressed in corporation laboratories, as well as
standards and users organizations around the world, it is highly
likely that ISDN will be interoperable on a normal basis, not
trial, by the middle of the decade.

HAYES RAISES ISDN IMAGE WITH PC ADAPTOR & SUPPORT PROGRAM

     Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. is promising access to
ISDN services for IBM PCs and compatible computers by mid-1990
with an internal ISDN PC Adaptor.  The product is based on
CCITT's basic rate interface (BRI), and supports both Northern
Telecom's and AT&T central office switches, X.25, and the
American National Standard's Institute (ANSI) high-speed data
transfer rates for circuit and packet-switched data.  The
estimated retail price is $1,599.  Dennis Hayes, president and
co-founder of the corporation, told ISDN NEWS the product had 6
revisions in 4 years and would be sold through telcos, large
systems integrators, and 2-4 technically qualified resellers.
     Expecting to have to "educate the sellers" as well as
activate the market with its support program for software
developers, Hayes reminisced that his company would do the same
thing it did for modems over 10 years ago.  However, he concluded
it had not been necessary to spend time with switch manufacturers
and service providers to develop capabilities with the early
modem market.
     "We see the market as a high-end segment above the dial-up
modem market," and expects ISDN to "change the way a company does
business with point-of sales, electronic banking, error control,
data compression, and other advanced applications for speed and
performance driving."

Broader market in possibly 18 months

     Hayes said that "in the next 18 months or when it gets to
the point long-distance ISDN is in operation, service is
tariffed, and we know everyone knows how to order service, we
expect to broaden the reseller base to LAN networks."
     Infrastructure is needed to support new products because
resellers do not know how to write software for advanced
features.  Applications are of primary importance with developers
and resellers working together; and Hayes has opened a laboratory
in Atlanta supported by engineers.
     Dr. John Copeland, vice president for systems engineering at
Hayes, added, "Pressure is building up.  In the last 15 years,
speed [requirements] have gone up a factor of 10 every 5 years;
[we are] reaching the limit of the analog phone."  Hayes added,
"We're paying the price of the break up of Bell System, [but by]
working with switch manufacturers, we see things coming
together."
     In December, a beachhead in Europe and possibly Asia was
secured when GPT and Hayes formed an alliance to develop,
manufacture and distribute products for ISDN networks.  (Hayes
Microcomputer Products, Box 105203, Atlanta, GA 30348, 404/449-
8791).

Kyodo to change its English corporate name+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Kyodo News Service said Monday its English corporate name will
be changed to Kyodo News, effective from Jan. 1.
     The news agency said the decision came to coincide with the 50th
anniversary of its foundation in 1945.  The Japanese name Kyodo
Tsushinsha will remain unchanged.
     The group's business arm, K.K. Kyodo News Service, will also
change its English name to K.K. Kyodo News.
     Of the group's three U.S. subsidiaries, the change applies only
to Kyodo News Service U.S.A. Inc., which will now be known as Kyodo
News America Inc.  The two others, Kyodo News California Inc. and
Kyodo News International Inc. will remain intact.

MITI to develop sophisticated enciphering technology+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Tuesday
it will develop sophisticated enciphering technology to meet the
requirements of an advanced information age.
     Research and development institutions affiliated with
universities and enterprises will be commissioned to undertake five
different projects over a two-year period starting Jan. 1, ministry
officials said.
     Cryptographic technologies exclusively for Japanese use are
required to protect private data from plagiarism, they said.
     They said sophisticated coding technology is necessary for the
settlement of transactions via electronic devices.
     The five projects were selected from among 47 candidates
proposed to the ministry this summer, the officials said.

Nintendo to enter Internet business next year+

OSAKA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Nintendo Co., a major maker of home video game machines, plans
to enter Internet business as early as next summer, Nintendo
officials said Tuesday.
     Nintendo is now developing a ''new type of magnetic disk drive''
with 64 megabytes of memory capacity that will complement the
capabilities of its projected home video machine called ''Nintendo
64,'' a company spokesman said.  Nintendo 64 will be marketed
starting next spring.
     On the strength of the new drive, Nintendo President Hiroshi
Yamauchi said the company plans to develop a machine that will enable
users to adjust the details of the prearranged story sequences of
video game software.
     The new 64-megabyte random access memory device will allow the
rewriting of video games and the storing of the rewritten stories,
unlike conventional machines that use read-only memory chips to store
game software, the officials said.
     Yamauchi said the company plans to develop ''a machine that will
allow users to rewrite the contents of a video game just as they want
its story to develop, while allowing users to store the rewritten
stories'' to complement the capabilities of the Nintendo 64 machine.
     Under a linkup agreement between Nintendo and Netscape
Communications Corp. of the United States, the pair are now
developing communication software that would allow users to exchange
such rewritten stories with each other through the Internet, they
said.
     Nintendo hopes to create an international club of fans of
Nintendo video games who would exchange their rewritten video game
stories with each other through the interlinking of the Internet and
the new machines, they said.

NETWORKS: Netaccess Multiport Modem Card

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Xircom

Tel: (805) 376-9300. In Asia: 65-323-1511. Fax: 65-224-3313

Price: Four modems: US$2,299. Eight modems: US$3,999. (Prices may
vary in Asia)

Requirements: Xircom's Netaccess Multiport Modem Card is a full-
length ISA card, requiring a 386-DX or higher processor for serial
port emulation, with more powerful CPUs needed to push Windows NT
or NetWare Connect. DRAM needs vary widely based on system
application requirements: from 4 MB to 8 MB for a basic Windows
3.1x station to 16 MB or more for an NT or OS/2 server. OS support
is robust, including compatibility with Windows 3.x, Windows NT,
and Windows 95; OS/2 2.x or higher; and NetWare 3.1x or higher.
Space in your bit box is a critical element, as there are lots of
LSI circuits producing copious amounts of heat. RAS users need to
support either AIO (NetWare), NDIS (Windows NT), or standard COM
ports. Xircom Asia says that this version will ship into some
countries in Asia-Pacific by early 1997.

N etaccess Multiport Modem Card is a full-length ISA board offering
four or eight modem ports. It features V.42bis and MNP 5
compression, onboard buffering, and speeds to 115.2 Kbps using
XMAPI mode.

Installation:

Installation path varies depending on the platform (Windows NT vs.
NetWare). Basic steps are card setup (a rotary switch sets card
mode), loading the driver from a single disk, then configuring
specific RAS and adapter settings within the OS environment.

Documentation:

Manuals are well illustrated, with succinct descriptions of
installation and operation functions. Includes complete AT and S-
register command reference, result codes, troubleshooting,
diagnostic software and support options.

Robustness/compatibility:

Supports standard COM port drivers, AIO (NetWare) and NDIS WAN
(Windows NT). Also tested with Lotus Notes.

Applicability:

Has the ability to support up to eight cards for a total of 64
ports cranking at up to 115 Kbps.

Ease of use:

Works in support of the RAS software we tested. Once setup problems
were solved, MobileView network management software sniffed out our
NetWare server, providing information on port status, signal
quality, interrupts, and connection status.

Test environment:

We tested the eight-port version in a 486-DX/66MHz HP LM server
with 32 MB of DRAM and 2 GB of hard drive space, running NetWare
4.1. We also tested it on a Compaq Deskpro 5100 100 MHz Pentium
with 48 MB of DRAM and 2 GB of hard drive space, running Windows NT
3.51.

Remote control testing was done with a Compaq LTE Elite 4/75 CXL
laptop running Windows 95 and a compatible PC running Windows 3.11
using Xircom's MobileView utility. A variety of PC-com patible
486/100 MHz-DX4s with 16 MB of DRAM were used as client stations to
establish connections using Windows 3.11, Windows NT, and OS/2 Warp
Connect 3.

Warranties and support: Check with your VAR or Xircom's Asian

NETWORKS: XIRCOM'S NETACCESS MULTIPORT MODEM CARD: The All-in-One
Approach

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

If you're not afraid to put all your eggs in one basket, check out
Xircom's multiport modem card-a single-board solution to remote
access networking.

ne of the problems with attaching remote access service to LAN
hardware has been the requisite multiport boards, the multiheaded
"Medusa" cables, and the multiple stacks of modems that need to be
connected. For those of you who are discouraged by the mass of
hardware confusion required for remote access, Xircom's Netaccess
Multiport Modem Cards (NMMCs) may offer you a solution.

BEYOND METROPOLIS

According to Xircom, Netaccess is the first ISA-based system to
fully integrate multimodem support into a single card, giving users
the power of either four (with the MPM-4) or eight (the MPM-8) V.34
modems in one slot.

Xircom lists the MTBF at 163,850 hours for the MPM-4 and 86,903
hours for the MPM-8. When viewed on a modem-to-modem basis,
however, Xircom's claims of a radically longer MTBF fall short of
Microcom's Deskport Fast modem, for example, which, in either a
rack or standalone external modem, lists a MTBF of 160,000 hours.
But, as Xircom points out, if all the other components required for
an operable component system are included in the calculations, the
overall MTBF for the other vendor's system may drop below
Netaccess' reliability level.

It's a bird... it's a plane...

Able to leap multiple platforms in a single bound, Netaccess is
compatible with NetWare 3.1x, NetWare 4.x, Windows NT 3.5x, and
OS/2 2.x and 3.x. Faster than a speeding parity bit, the NMMC
supports remote access services (RAS) software that complies with
Asynchronous I/O (AIO), NDIS, or standard COM port drivers. More
powerful than a local node, Xircom supports up to eight cards per
system, so if you have the slots, you could be powering up to 64
lines from a single PC. With powers and abilities far beyond
ordinary modems, the NMMC allows transmission speeds up to 115.2
Kbps when using Xircom drivers, supporting V.42bis and Microcom
Networking Protocol (MNP) 5 compression, as well as V.42 and MNP
(level 2 through level 4) error detection, with full V.34 support
for speeds between 2,400 bps and 28.8 Kbps.

One of the slickest features of Netaccess is its ability to
configure each port individually, allowing administrators to
distribute line access privileges and setups on a port-by-port
basis via their RAS configuration settings.

Netaccess cards contain two 4 KB onboard buffers-one transmit and
one receive-and include flash upgradable firmware, with firmware
revisions available via Xircom's BBS ([805] 376-9130) or Web site
(http://www.xircom.com). At the time of this writing, the latest
Netaccess release was 2.64b, although Xircom's BBS listing has a
typo showing the file to be 2.46.

Xircom has tested and approved NetWare Connect, Microsoft RAS, and
Lotus Notes for use with Netaccess, but any system that is
compatible with either AIO or NDIS standards will work. Xircom also
lists Citrix Systems' Win View for Networks and Symantec's pcAny
where access server as compatible systems.

Another of Netaccess' talents lies in its proprietary function
mode, XMAPI (Xircom Mobile Application Programming Interface).
Netaccess can function in either of two modes: straight COM port
emulation or XMAPI. Mode selection is accomplished by dialing the
rotary configuration switch to the setting for XMAPI or to other
settings that select one of several COM port emulation modes.

The XMAPI architecture provides support for high-speed, block-mode
data transfers using shared memory and onboard buffers, enabling
Netaccess to crank along at 115.2 Kbps. When operating in XMAPI
mode, the Netaccess card bypasses the motherboard UART. This factor
allows for higher transfer rates than is possible when data runs
through a serial connection via either 8250 UART or 16550 UART.
Achieving these high data transfer rates does not require a
Netaccess card on both ends of the transfer-any modem supporting
V.42bis is compatible.

UP, UP, THEN AWAY

Installation and configuration of Netaccess is easy under Windows
NT, but considerably more difficult under NetWare Connect. Xircom
has eliminated DIP switch blocks, opting instead for a single-
function, rotary-dial configuration switch that allows
configuration of the card's I/O port address, IRQ, and operation
mode (COM port emulation or XMAPI). Once you have set the card
switch and installed the card into an available ISA slot, you can
load card drivers, which are located on a single disk. Once the
drivers are loaded, you must visit the network adapter and RAS
configuration screens specific to the OS in use to make the
Netaccess card available as a port resource.

Although installation instructions are included in the product's
user manual, you may want to call Xircom's toll-free FactsLine in
the US (a fax request system) at (800) 775-0400 and request fax
document numbers 4608 (for Windows NT installation) or 4611 (for
the NetWare installation). The fax documents provide more detailed
instructions and troubleshooting information than does the product
manual.

Installation on our NetWare server was problematic as a result of
incomplete and misleading documentation concerning the loading of
the Xircom drivers. Our Xircom diskette was labeled 1.13, which, as
instructed by the documentation, led us to copy the file aioxrc.mdc
into the same directory con taining the aiomdms.mdc in an attempt
to make Xircom's multiport modem driver available to NetWare.

We discovered that merely copying this file to the server
accomplished nothing more than the consumption of a few bytes of
disk space, as nothing more is done with this file according to
Xircom's instructions.

We found that the user must manually rename the existing
aiomdms.mdc temporarily (for example, to aiomdms.old) and load the
Xircom file in its place. Instructions referring to Xircom driver
release 1.10 called for loading the version of aiomdms that was
provided on the disk, but our 1.13 variant contained no such file
in any directory. As a result, we could nottrack the installation
path using the older loading procedure, either. Instructions
regarding NetWare Connect configurations contained numerous minor,
yet annoying, errors. Those instructions tell you to select
Configuring Ports, for example, but the actual prompt is simply
named Ports. This type of mismatch was evident throughout the
NetWare Connect configuration section, which was especially
bothersome because we were running NetWare Connect 2.0, the version
specified in the included documentation. We detected a
documentation revision synchronisation syndrome.

We encountered a minor glitch when attempting to execute a load
aioxrcm1 command using command syntax provided by Xircom. At first
glance, Xircom's command syntax seems to indicate that int= and
irq= are equivalent command options, but deeper scrutiny led us to
discover that the int command accepted only a hex argument (int=b),
whereas the irq command accepted only a decimal parameter (irq=11),
hence the program's rejection of our attempted irq=11. Written
documentation did provide this information, but we would like to
see the command syntax designate these two parameters as distinct
items. This problem was further compounded by the total lack of
command examples within this section of the manual.

This is not to say that the documentation provided with the product
was entirely inadequate. On the contrary, we generally found
Xircom's Netaccess documentation to be among the best modem manuals
we've seen. The text is well written (with the exception of the
previously mentioned problems regarding NetWare installations),
offering many informative illustrations and complete reference
sections covering at commands, S-registers, and modem result codes.
Xircom's FactsLine fax documentation adds another level of detail
to an already worthy product manual.

X-ray Vision Included

NetWare network administrators will definitely want to check out
Xircom's MobileView network management software. MobileView allows
any Windows 3.x user connected to a Novell network to monitor any
Netaccess cards located in any NetWare server. MobileView installs
easily from a single diskette and provides status reports either by
card display or by port display groupings.

Card status displays include information concerning interrupts, I/O
address settings, and active drivers. Port status displays provide
port speed, connection status, modem status, and signal quality
information.

MobileView also contains an option to trap SNMP messages, which can
help track down network or card problems. Although loading the
MobileView software was a simple task, it took several discussions
with Xircom's technical support staff before we were able to get
the software to find our NetWare server.

Clicking on the Discover button causes MobileView to seek out any
NetWare servers containing Netaccess multiport modems. MobileView
then automatically adds those servers to a server database on the
remote PC. You can also manually add servers to the list, avoiding
the need to rescan the network. MobileView displays the servers it
discovers in a vertical column within the MobileView main screen
display, requiring the user to simply double-click on the desired
server's icon to select it, then to click either the Cards button
or the Ports button to view the status displays. Xircom also
provides diagnostic software and hardware to test the Netaccess
card.

Two DOS-level utilities (mpm4term and mpm8term) are included on the
Utility Soft ware disk, along with a set of RJ-11 patch cords for
loopback port testing. Once started, the diagnostic program
displays individual port information in two columns of status
boxes, with a larger command window displayed at the bottom of the
interface.

You can enter one of five commands (run, version, config, window,
and exit) to control the test program, although we found that the
system also responds to selected DOS commands, such as dir and cls.
Xircom includes a set of 28 .scr script files which you can run to
perform loopback tests using the run command. Entering run test38,
for example, runs a test between port 3 and port 8, dialing and
answering from each side of the loopback connection.

The config command scans the current rotary switch and card
settings and updates the related information contained in the
mpm8.cfg configuration file, which is used by the diagnostic
utility driver to perform the loopback tests. If you change the
card setup, you must rerun config. If you don't, the loopback tests
will report errors.

Pocketful of Kryptonite

As previously mentioned, we encountered problems getting MobileView
to find our NetWare server. Clicking the Discover button yielded a
"Local server not found" error message. Attempts at connections
from Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 workstations both failed to locate
the Netaccess card. After researching , we discovered that we had
two types of problems.

First, we found that only connections based on Virtual Loadable
Modules (VLMs) are supported within MobileView's SNMP-based search.
Because Windows NT systems do not use VLMs at all, any Windows NT
station running MobileView will fail to detect the Novell server
with the modem card.

A Windows 95 workstation could be configured to find the card, but
only if a DOS-based VLM is loaded during start-up. Without VLM
support, the Windows 95 station also fails to discover the modem.
The MobileView documentation card initially led us away from this
conclusion, as the systems requirement section stated that the
product required Windows 3.1 or higher, when it should have stated
that only Windows 3.1 and 3.11 are fully supported.

Second, we found that MobileView fails in mixed Novell environments
where both NetWare 4.10 and NetWare 3.12 servers are operating.
When we logged in to the NetWare 4.10 server (using either bindery
or directory services authentication) and also attached to a 3.12
server (only bindery authentication is available on 3.12),
MobileView failed to discover the Netaccess card located in the
4.10 server. When we logged in only to the 3.12 server or to the
4.10 server, the system discovered our modem without incident. As
we had only one multiport card to evaluate, we were unable to test
whether cards placed in both 3.12 and 4.10 machines would be
discovered using our single login hypothesis.

The readme.txt file contained on the MobileView disk contained a
little more information concerning setup and troubleshooting than
was found in the folding card, but provided no specific
requirements or troubleshooting items for either SNMP or IPX
issues. Help options simply restated the information contained on
the tent card, providing no additional information.

Conclusion

Overall, Xircom's Netaccess Multiport Modem Card is a great
product. Its pricing is comparable to its rack modem counterparts,
and it includes improved reliability and system compactness in the
bargain. Installation instructions for the NetWare portion of the
modem setup need to be cleaned up, both in the accompanying user
manuals and in the FactsLine-based documentation, to eliminate
sporadic inconsistencies. MobileView is a useful utility, but
inadequate and misleading documentation concerning specific system
requirements combined with a lack of troubleshooting information
made installation more difficult than it ought to have been.  LAN

NETWORKS: DS Expert NetPro Computing

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

7150 E. Camelback Rd., Ste. 100
Scottsdale, AZ 85251
(602) 941-3600
http://www.netpro.com info@netpro.com

Price: A two-server starter pack lists for US$1,299, with
additional agents available for US$499. In quantity, prices for
additional agents drop to about US$350 each. Support costs are
based on the number of agents, starting at US$70 per agent and
falling to US$55 each for more than 100 agents.

Requirements: DS Expert has three modules. The tree monitor runs on
only one server per tree. The agent runs on every server that has a
replica. The last module is on administrator workstations, and the
first two are NLMs that run on any server that meets Novell's
minimum requirements for NetWare. Nevertheless, NetPro recommends
that the server with the tree monitor have at least 16 MB of RAM,
and if there are more than 100 servers in the tree, the company
recommends a Pentium 90 or better with at least 32 MB of RAM.
Administrator's workstations must be running Windows 3.1 or Windows
95, with at least 16 MB of RAM. They also need about 2 MB of
permanent space for the client software and up to 20 MB of
temporary space for traces.

S Expert is the first tool for NetWare 4.x administrators that is
designed to help optimise NDS. It examines partitions and replica
rings and reports on replicas that are either over utilised or
underutilised, thus optimising the network.

Installation: The program comes on two diskettes. The installation
program, setup.exe, runs under Windows 3.1 with Virtual Loadable
Module support or under Windows 95 running the Novell 32-bit client
software. It specifically does not run under Microsoft's 32-bit
client for NetWare. The installation program copies the tree
monitor and the agent to the servers of your choice and applies the
licenses. It also provides a batch file, netpro.ncf, that you can
run to begin the monitoring process, and the installation program
adds it to your autoexec.ncf.

In order to complete the installation properly, you have to call
NetPro with your serial number, the name of your tree, and your
contact information. The company provides you with a password for
the tree manager.

Documentation: There is a 125-page, spiral-bound manual that covers
all parts of the software in minute detail. The manual starts with
an excellent discussion of NDS, partitions, and replicas, before
moving on to installation and use of the program. A nice touch is
found in Appendix B, which lists the NDS error codes and explains
them.

This list is kept up-to-date by Novell and can be found at
ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/ updates/nwos/nw410.

The program is relatively self-explanatory, which is good. The help
system is sparse, and many of the comments are self-laudatory
rather than informative.

Technical support: NetPro maintains a wide array of methods for
accessing support. You can contact the company via a BBS at (602)
941-3620, a CompuServe e-mail account at 70524,2670, a Web site at
http://www.netpro.com, an ftp site at ftp.netpro.com, and an
Internet e-mail address at info@netpro.com.

No matter how you contact the company, support is based on annual
contracts and is priced at US$70 per agent down to US$55 per agent,
depending on quantity. There is a free initial 90-day support
period, which ought to be sufficient for small shops.

Warranty: Thirty-day warranty from date of delivery.

Ease of use: From the administrator's workstation, you need to run
only one program, which brings up several different comparative
charts and tables. When synchronisation problems occur, they are
reported to the tree manager and reflected in the Windows
application. The shortcoming here is that the program does not snap
into more robust monitors such as LANDesk or GroupWise. Nor does it
have the ability to send mail or notify a pager. Simple Mail
Transport Protocol support is also lacking.

Robustness/compatibility: The program runs under Windows 3.1 and
Windows 95, but in the latter case it requires the Novell 32-bit
client for Windows. It does not run with the Microsoft client for
NetWare. Once running, however, it works as advertised with minimal
bandwidth and storage requirements. The requirement to call NetPro
for the password that's tied to the tree name brings back all of
the copy-protection problems that were common a decade ago.

Applicability: DS Expert is used to manage partitions and replicas
in a large NDS environment. It can identify replica placement
that's causing excessive bandwidth utilisation and delayed
responses. It can even suggest alternatives that would work better.
The information it presents on a single, integrated screen would
take hours to manually collect and collate using Novell's
dsrepair.nlm. Given the importance of the NDS structure to the
NetWare 4.1 environment, this is a tool that LAN administrators
won't want to be without.

Test environment: Tests were performed using 2 NetWare 4.1 servers
in a single tree. The workstations were connected via Ethernet 10-
BaseT. Workstations were a Dell 486/33 MHz with 20 MB of RAM
running Windows 3.1 and a 90 MHz Pentium-based PC with 32 MB of RAM
running Windows 95. All machines used SMC Elite 16 Combo Ethernet
adapters.  LAN

NETWORKS: NETPRO COMPUTING'S DS EXPERT: Tracing the Server Family Tree

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

DS Expert gives network administrators the tools they need to
manage the NDS database-tools that NetWare 4.x fails to provide
efficiently.

hen Novell introduced NetWare 4.0, it ushered in a shift in which
users and administrators had to get used to the idea of treating
servers as just another network resource and the idea that one logs
in to the network rather than the server. Similarly, the new
version represented a change for network designers, who had to
figure out how to store, update, synchronise, and protect these
network resources.

NetWare 4.0 was a monumental leap forward; nevertheless, I believe
it fell short in many respects. For example, the default rules for
partition and replica creation had to be revised and re-revised as
experience with the product accumulated. The first version of
NetWare 4.0 made no replicas, leaving the task to the
administrator. This plan lacked any fault tolerance and made the
first server a bottleneck. So, Novell made some adjustments, and
the next version made a replica for every server. When
synchronisation traffic from this new replica rule choked the
cables, it was up to the administrator to cut back on the number of
replicas.

The current version has a new default rule. It makes replicas on
only the first three servers created, which is a compromise that
works in many, but clearly not all cases. Another problem was that
the early versions automatically made new partitions by merely
installing a server in a container created by the installation
program. This factor created problems of its own by eliminating
automatic replication, which made the problems of 4.0 reemerge.

The dsrepair.nlm.nlm has changed, too. The initial versions of
dsrepair.nlm.nlm looked at the partitions and replicas stored on a
particular server and checked them for integrity, but those servers
had a very limited ability to communicate with other NetWare 4.0
servers on the LAN. Thankfully, the current release is a remarkably
robust troubleshooting and diagnostic tool.

With all of this progress, there is still one need that NetWare 4.0
fails to cover: a functional analysis of the current partition and
replica design. For example, network managers need to know if the
design is efficient. Is the design causing bottlenecks? Is there an
exposure due to too few replicas? Are the existing replicas used
evenly, or are there some that handle far more (or less) than their
proportionate share? Are there some replicas that take
significantly longer to synchronise, and if so, why? The purpose of
DS Expert, a program from US-based NetPro Computing, is not only to
answer these questions, but to help guide the administrator toward
a better NetWare Directory Services (NDS ) design.

WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

NetPro is licensed on a per-server basis. The initial package
includes the tree management program and two server agents (which
consist of the NLMs that monitor replica activity and report it to
the tree manager). Additional agents may be purchased as needed.
Servers without replicas don't need an agent, and servers with more
than one replica need only one agent. If a replica is created and
there are no additional agents available, some information is still
available, such as the replica type (read/write, master, read/only,
or subordinate reference), and is reported properly. However, no
alerts will be generated for anomalous conditions that might exist
on that server.

DS Expert comes on two diskettes. Before installing the program,
you will have to call NetPro and give the company your serial
number and tree name, after which you receive the password that
enables your program. Both the registration form and the manual
mention this need for a telephone call-however, the packaging fails
to point it out, and the box contains no special notice slip.

I went into the lab at 9 a.m. on a Sunday to install the product
and was unable to reach the company to obtain a password. Since
most prudent administrators install and test system management
software during evening and weekend hours, I suspect that limited
company availability will be a common problem. NetPro should either
print the requirement to obtain the password via telephone directly
on the box or include a notice with an appropriate message
indicating the company's hours of operation. Better yet, the
company should trust its users' honesty and abandon this indirect
copy-protection scheme.

Once I obtained the password, I found installation to be quick and
relatively painless. The program requires certain versions of CLIB
and other support NLMs, and for those whose systems have not been
updated, NetPro provides instruction on finding the latest versions
of these programs at Novell's ftp site or via NetWire, Novell's
forum on CompuServe.

The installation program asks you to specify the server that is to
host the tree management program and suggests a higher-performance
machine for those users with large LANs (NetPro claims that its
tree manager running on a 32 MB, 90 MHz Pentium easily supports 100
servers). All the servers with replicas need a copy of the agent
software, which the installation program sends out. As a nice
touch, the tree manager is capable of distributing the agent at a
later time should a replica be added to a server that never had one
before (an unused agent license is available). This feature saves
the administrator the trouble of remembering to install the agent
and the headache that comes from wondering why DS Expert isn't
reporting the activities of the new replica and the replica's
server.

Finally, the installation program adds a Windows group and two
icons-one for the program and the other for the read me file-as it
copies the administrator's application to whatever location the
installer specifies (the default is c:\dsexpert).

HELPING YOU HELP YOURSELF

Some LAN administrators are purely reactive. That is, they wait for
problems to arise, and then they fix them. Others are proactive,
anticipating problems before they occur and taking steps to prevent
them. The former approach is more common, but the latter is far
less stressful for the network manager. While DS Expert will work
for both camps, it is designed to be a proactive tool.

NDS is defined as a "loosely consistent" database. This definition
means that it does not have to be in complete synchronisation 100
percent of the time. For example, if you change your password, then
log out and log back in via some distant server, you might find
that, for a minute or two, the old password still works. The
reason? NDS uses the Service Advertising Protocol (SAP) packets to
communicate, and it holds on to updates and sends them out as
single, larger packets in order to minimise bandwidth utilisation.
It can take a few minutes for an SAP broadcast to work its way from
server to server within the network. NDS is built to tolerate these
time-dependent differences.

For this reason, merely comparing the contents of two replicas and
finding some minor inconsistencies won't necessarily identify a
problem area.

On the other hand, differences that don't resolve themselves in a
fairly short time period are problems that must be addressed before
they cause erratic behaviour for users and programs.

As a result, administrators have to examine the tree and search for
problem areas. DS Expert can issue four different kinds of alerts:
Replica Sync, Time Sync, Load Average, and Low Memory/Disk Space.
Because NDS is loosely consistent, you can program DS Expert to
issue the alert only when the condition has been constant for an
extended period of time. Those without DS Expert have to use
NetWare's dsrepair.nlm NLM to keep an eye on their NDS databases.

This presents two problems. One is that the database has to be
closed while the NLM is running. The other is that dsrepair.nlm
forces an immediate synchronisation of the database. Closing the
database prevents it from handling authentication or being updated,
possibly inconveniencing users. Forcing a synchronisation wastes
bandwidth. Worst of all, because the NDS design allows for loosely
consistent replicas, any errors reported by dsrepair.nlm are
suspect.

Listing 1 shows what you may get when you run dsrepair.nlm. Even
though the display indicates an error condition, there is probably
nothing wrong with your system. The error 625 means that the server
on which dsrepair.nlm is running isn't able to communicate with
another server.

Most likely, it is a LAN or WAN communications problem, though it
can also occur if the NDS database on the other server is also
locked (if, for example, another administrator is running
dsrepair.nlm at that server). Aside from dsrepair.nlm, there is
another way to get the information on your NDS database. NetWare
provides an NDS tracing tool that is enabled by issuing the Set
command (set dstrace=on) at the console prompt.

Enabling this tool causes NDS information to be displayed on the
console in a rather cryptic form, and the information scrolls off
too quickly to read in a busy network. To make reading the
information easier, you can direct the information to a file using
the four commands shown in Listing 2. The four steps simply tell
NetWare to begin logging synchronisation information to the screen,
then to send it to a file called sys:dstrace.log, to clear the file
of previous contents, if any, and to complete resynchronisation of
all replicas.

dsrepair.nlm.nlm and the NDS tracing tool are the only two
techniques for checking the synchronisation and replica information
that NetWare provides, yet they are unreliable. The tools look at
one particular server and report on its health and well-being
without providing information about the other servers. The only way
to be sure there is a problem is to monitor the entire database
over a period of time and note the recurring inconsistencies.

This stage is where DS Expert shines. The tree monitor and its
agents are constantly looking at and keeping statistics on all NDS
network activities. A few minutes spent looking at the status
screens of the DS Expert Windows client can give an accurate
picture of the status of the database.

Figure 1 (page 86) shows the tree view. With this view, you can see
all of the partitions, servers, and replicas. The tree is shown
starting with the root, and if there are subordinate partitions, a
folder is created with those partitions as entries. If a partition
has an alert pending, its entry has a red circle next to it-those
that are problem-free display a green circle.

Expanding the tree near the errors displays a Current Alerts
subfolder. If you open that folder, you see the text of the alert
that triggered the error indicator. As an administrator, you even
have the ability to adjust the alert thresholds. For example, a
threshold of three replicas is considered to be the minimum for a
partition. If, however, you intentionally have only two, you can
set the threshold lower to suppress the alert.

If you set alert thresholds so that DS Expert indicates when an
anomalous condition occurs, you simply check the client software
from time to time and rest assured that the database is in good
health. When an occasional alert is raised, you are the first to
know, and it is possible that you will know even before the problem
begins to negatively impact the network.

The DS Statistics tab on that same screen displays the workload
being handled for a replica. Because the agents are constantly
running, they can track the number of times a particular partition
is used to resolve a name or to perform other tasks. Figure 2 shows
the statistics for several of the NDS commands, which are called
"verbs." By comparing the utilisation levels of each of the servers
in a replica ring, you can determine if access is balanced. If it
isn't, you need to decide if the situation merits further
investigation.

There are several designs that won't be balanced-for example, a
replica of a branch office partition kept in the home office will
never have the same number of accesses as the one in the branch
office itself; and there are several designs that might-for
example, several servers on the backbone that carry the entire
tree. As an administrator, you can see if the actual utilisation
meets your expectations, and you can monitor the statistics over
time to see if there are changes that you might want to address.

As a final note, DS Expert isn't an NDS design tool. If each of the
three replicas of your partition are located in the home office and
the two branch offices, DS Expert won't issue any alerts telling
you that you need a better plan or that you're wasting a lot of WAN
bandwidth for no good reason.

On the other hand, if DS Expert hasn't heard from one of the
branches for a while, it lets you know that your tree is in danger.
Also, DS Expert has no ties to tools that expedite delivery of the
alerts. There is no pager or e-mail function, nor is the program
SNMP-based. Administrators who don't remember to check the client
program might as well not install it.

THE WRAP-UP

DS Expert doesn't change anything on your NetWare 4.0 network. It
merely reports the status of your partition and replica structure
and suggests changes (such as adding replicas) that you should
make.Making modifications to an NDS tree is still an art more than
a science, and similar to an art teacher, DS Expert can identify
areas that need improvement and suggest techniques that will work
better. But, it is ultimately up to the student to execute the
task. Just as most students do better after following their
teacher's instructions, so, too, will most LAN administrators
improve their networks after studying DS Expert's advice.  LAN

NETWORKS: Java Does it for Databases, Too

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Java is an object-oriented programming language closely modeled on
C++. The main differences between the two are based on the needs
for platform independence, security, and application size. However,
there is one major similarity: In business applications, client-
server or otherwise, neither language has native support for
databases-unlike Visual Basic and Delphi. Initial Java applets were
much like a tic-tac-toe game, animation, and other visually
interesting contexts in that they lacked persistent data storage.

In order to make Java useful for corporate development, the
JavaSoft team has proposed the JavaSoft Database Connectivity
(JDBC) API. Based on the X/Open Call Level Interface, JavaSoft's
goal is "to define a generic SQL database access framework which
provides a uniform interface on top of a variety of different
database connectivity modules. This allows programmers to write to
a single database interface, enables DBMS-independent Java
application development tools and products, and allows database
connectivity vendors to provide a variety of different connectivity
solutions."

JDBC is organised like other Java subsystems (see diagram below)-
such as the I/O and the language and graphics subsystems-as a
package of classes that encapsulate a well-defined set of services.
Because of security issues and potential lack of local database
access support (that is, a preinstalled ODBC driver), the JDBC
proposal anticipates that the three-tier architecture will be very
common. In using such a scheme, Java applications make calls to a
service layer on the network whose internals handle accessing the
database(s). From that position, the middle layers could function
much the same as any OLE or object request broker (ORB) server.

NETWORKS: Client-Server Moves to the 'Net

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

What's on the horizon for client-server computing? The next bastion
to conquer is the host-based world of the global Internet.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

As computing technology evolves, this timeless cliche can be
applied as much to the computer world as to history in general. In
the beginning there were end user terminals that gave direction to
large host systems that ran the applications; the hosts pumped the
results back to the terminals. Hosts changed sizes and became more
specialised.

Then along came PCs, which revolutionised the business world,
putting the power of the old hosts on each user's desktop. But
there was a hitch: Each individual had his or her own set of
information, often duplicating his or her neighbour's machine.
Sharing that information was very difficult. LANs arrived and
seemed to resolve that problem. But every bright cloud has its
muddy brown lining: Networks were very hard to maintain and the
applications they required were hard to write.

A few years ago, some smart people recognised that the union of
relational databases and front-end applications made a potent
combination. They named the new technology client-server. Still,
there were concerns.

"How do I manage data scattered at offices all over the world?"
grumbled managers. "How do I use this expensive technology to
create closer relationships to my customers and find new models
that lower the cost of doing business?"

Some answers are found by returning to the earliest forms of
computing-host systems that take direction from user terminals.
Now, though, the connection is open to anyone. And anyone can be
secure and use rapidly created applications that change dynamically
in response to evolving conditions.

The key to this change is, of course, the Internet and its younger
cousin the intranet-here referred to jointly as the 'Net. And many
products are being developed to take advantage of the new paradigm.
Just consider the 'Net as one global host system.

SECURITY

Analysts, visionaries, and everyday Joes predict great things for
the 'Net. Stock market successes such as Netscape, Yahoo, and even
America Online are evidence of that.

Analysts estimate that within 10 years, electronic, or online,
commerce may account for about one-fifth of the U.S. economy. But
to reach anything close to that share, the inherent insecurity of a
decentralised, unorganised system such as the 'Net-where users
can't even know who owns the computers through which their traffic
passes-must be transformed.

Last year, a group of visionary companies including Visa
International, MasterCard, Microsoft, IBM, and Netscape banded
together to create Secure Electronic Technology (SET). SET is a
protocol that provides a way to automatically route payment
information between users, merchants, and their banks.

The protocol specifies technology that encrypts credit card
transactions, automates the processing and clearing of credit card
payments, works with existing security protocols (such as Secure
Sockets Layer), and is supported by toolkits from Microsoft, RSA
Data Security, and Terisa Systems. In April, Terisa Systems
introduced SecureWeb Toolkit 2.0. This standard is an early, open
commercial step toward winning the confidence of the general public
for electronic commerce.

JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT

Like a nova bursting across the night sky, a new language called
Java has swept aside competition in the race to create a standard
programming facility for the World Wide Web. Sun Microsystems
initially created the project that resulted in Java in the hopes of
developing a set-top cable television box. That market, into which
many companies poured millions of dollars over the last seven
years, is still somewhere out in the future. Java is probably the
only commercial product to come out of those years of research.

Java exploded out of Sun's labs so quickly that even now, only a
few months after it moved out of beta and into production, it is
impossible to count the books, magazines, conferences, and Web
sites devoted to it. One major computer book publisher, which
typically ships 5,000 copies of new titles to bookstores, shipped
20,000 copies of its first advanced Java programming book-and it
sold out almost immediately.

What is most amazing is that Java has achieved this unprecedented
level of acceptance while still being an incredibly hard to learn
language. It is C++ with minor differences in regard to memory
management and access to hardware. The latter delta is for
practical, rather than technical reasons: How many users would let
some unknown applet be downloaded and executed on their computers
if there was no such limitation?

JavaSoft, Sun's new subsidiary created to develop, manage, and
market Java, has proposed a new API: Java Database Connectivity
(JDBC). JDBC will allow Java applications to access any back-end
database in the same way as ODBC.

In fact, the draft proposal for the JDBC API standard states that
ODBC should be leveraged and that the two APIs, both being based on
the X/Open SQL Call-level interface, may even be able to use the
same drivers (with a small bridge driver connecting JDBC to ODBC).
(For more on JDBC, see "Java Does it for Databases, Too.")

OLD 'SOFT-Y

As late as the end of last year, Bill Gates was discounting the
significance of the Internet. Four months later, he totally
reorganised Microsoft, instructing his employees to find ways to
adapt Microsoft's products to 'Net life. Often in computing
history, new generations of technology have caused old giants to
fall, but so far Gates has avoided the myopic vision that did in
his predecessors. Microsoft has responded to the Internet surge by:

 Releasing Internet Assistants for all office components that
convert spreadsheets, databases, documents, and graphics to HTML;

 Purchasing Vermeer Technology for its FrontPage HTML editor;

 Releasing Internet Information Server at no cost;

 Announcing an end-to-end electronic commerce system called
Merchant (using the security technology discussed earlier);

 Updating the OCX standard to ActiveX to support 'Net components
and releasing a set of basic ActiveX components (such as Winsock,
ftp, HTML and Network News Transport Protocol [NNTP]);

 Adding support to Visual C++ via five new classes in the Microsoft
Foundation Classes;

 Announcing Peer Web Services to allow Windows 95 and Windows NT
users to expose folders on local hard drives as Web pages;

 Releasing VBScript, a freely available, multiplatform, lightweight
version of Visual Basic; and,

 Licensing Java, plus a Java development environment (Jakarta),
and, plans to include the Java Virtual Machine in future releases
of the operating system products.

A key theme running throughout Microsoft's efforts is leveraging
the installed skills base. Rather than requiring users to learn
completely new programming languages and tools, Microsoft now tries
to add 'Net capabilities to existing products. "Microsoft has the
resources to back all the horses in the race," said Dwight Davis,
editor of Windows Watcher. "No one knows enough to make any
predictions, but Microsoft is determined to cover all the bets."

THE REST OF THE PACK

Microsoft is not alone in providing 'Net-related tools to corporate
developers. The main competitors to Visual Basic in the low-to-
middle end of the client-server application development market are
Sybase PowerBuilder and Borland Delphi. Both are responding to the
challenge of creating applications that can live on the 'Net.

With the motto "Fast Applications Anywhere," the PowerSoft division
of Sybase had planned to ship version 5.0 of PowerBuilder by the
end of second quarter 1996. This release adds a compiler (something
users of interpreted development tools always clamour for) based on
the proven Watcom technology, and the ability to create three-tier
applications with server-based components.

However, while Visual Basic 4.0's Remote OLE facility can be used
with non-Visual Basic OLE servers, PowerSoft will take a closed
approach. In this first step into the distributed arena, Mitch
Kramer, of the Patricia Seybold Group, labeled PowerBuilder's
middleware as proprietary.

ParcPlace-Digitalk provides a mid-level development tool called the
VisualWave Development Environment. Based on its long-established
VisualWorks Smalltalk environment, VisualWave takes the drudgery
out of creating ready-to-run 'Net applications with a cross-
platform, multidatabase, object-oriented system.

It automatically converts screens, forms, and tables into HTML, and
generates the required Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts. The
included Personal Web Server allows applications to be tested
directly on the development machine. On the downside, you must also
purchase the VisualWave Internet Application Server as well as
climb the steep learning curve of the encyclopedic Smalltalk class
library.

Oracle is also moving aggressively into the 'Net marketspace.
Recently, it released Designer/2000 WebServer Generator, a free
upgrade to Developer/2000. Now developers can create applications
that query Oracle databases and publish reports via browsers.

"For internal clients, Developer/2000 2.0 [this upgrade is due
before the end of 1996] would allow us to run a thin client that
runs a Java applet. So, if we need to upgrade the application, we
upgrade the server, not the client," said a senior applications
developer with a large US retail company. "Implementing multi-tier
architecture would keep client-side maintenance costs down."

Attachmate made its reputation delivering host connectivity to PCs.
But now it is moving into the 'Net as well. The Extra Developer
Series enables developers to create applications that access host
data from Windows 95 and Windows NT platforms running over
intranets or traditional networks. The host data can either be
coming from databases, mainframe screens, or program-based business
logic. QuickApp generates code for Visual Basic, C++, PowerBuilder,
and Delphi that allows systems developed in those environments to
use screen-based data.

MOVING INTO THE HIGH END

Among the range of larger scale application development systems,
Forte Software and Texas Instruments Software are taking fairly
typical approaches.

Next Software and Haht Software are bringing out completely new
tools.

Version 2.0 of Forte's eponymous software, released late in 1995,
allows enterprise developers to create dynamically partitioned
applications so that developers can tune deploy-ment needs among
client machines and any number of appropriately powered and located
servers. To add 'Net access via any browser, the company recently
announced the Forte Web Server software development kit.

In April, TI released WebCenter. Web Center, combined with an
existing TI product, Composer, delivers enterprise-class
applications that can be delivered concurrently in any of four
configurations: host/terminal, traditional client-server, PC
clients (such as spreadsheets), and 'Net clients against server-
based applications (see Figure 1).

Dan Ivanov, manager of information technology at Air Canada, says,
"We are committed to delivering strong support to our customers and
believe that WebCenter will allow us to significantly improve the
quality and speed of our customer service in a very short time."
WebCenter provides browser clients with a live 'Net page with
dynamic content rather than a display of static documents. Through
Composer's ability to connect to any database, relational or
legacy, WebCenter users can provide global data access to their own
customer base.

NEW FROM THE WEB

Next Software was originally founded by Steve Jobs to develop and
sell machines for the educational market. With the first commercial
release in 1988, though, reality forced the company to expand its
horizons to include the business market.

Over the next few years, Next struggled in a crowded Unix bazaar
and finally gave up. Instead, they have been building on the simple
yet powerful application development system that was part of the
NextStep operating system.

Most recently, the firm released the Web Objects product line. The
entry-level version offers an easy entry point for building dynamic
'Net applications that incorporate a set of prebuilt components and
WebScript. This version can be downloaded for free from
http://www.next.com.

WebObjects Pro adds the ability to incorporate C, C++, and
Objective C code as well as OLE connectivity and database client
library support. It also provides for distributed 'Net application
servers facilitating scalability and management. The top-of-the-
line version, Web Objects Enter prise, provides a complete dynamic
'Net development solution. This variant is targeted to customers
requiring a solution that encapsulates existing data and
applications.

"We're very impressed with the functionality WebObjects brings to
corporations building dynamic, Web-based ap pli cations," said Jona
thon Schwartz, president of Lighthouse Design. "In less than two
months of working with WebObjects, Lighthouse has already delivered
WebVision, a server-based developer component designed to augment
Next's technology, delivering data-driven graphics to WebObjects
developers."

Haht Software, a year-old startup, is marketing its product
Hahtsite-as a tool for stretched-thin MIS staffers who are being
pulled into 'Net development projects. Founded by a group of
executives from Q+E Software, Hahtsite uses a compiled Unix version
of Visual Basic rather than CGI scripts to handle scalability and
security issues. Applications created with this tool are entirely
server-based, with HTML pages created and accessed by browser
clients. The developer product runs on Windows 95, Windows NT, and
Solaris (see Figure 2).

DECISION SUPPORT

A basic need in most client-server systems is standard reporting.
Actuate Software is set to ship Actuate Report Server 3.0, the
first report server that can serve up reports as Universal Resource
Locators (URLs).

Using Web Agent, which connects any Web server to the report
server, corporations can make predefined report formats accessible
to any browser client. The Actuate Viewer Plug-in adds searching
and help capability, table of contents, and hyperlinks to other
reports. According to Larry Sikon, chief technologist with
Montgomery Securities, "The Report Server is oriented to high-
volume, client-server-level reporting. Overall, Actuate has done a
good job of emulating the Visual Basic mode of development, which
is visual, and which reuses objects."

IQ Software announced a new member of their IQ series of client-
server decision support software, IQ/LiveWeb, which allows users to
publish corporate data over the 'Net. It allows users to submit
queries to corporate databases, schedule them for execution, and
publish them on Web servers in HTML or Portable Document Format.

When discussing decision support, Online Analytical Processing
(OLAP) isn't far behind. Sure enough, MicroStrategy and Arbor
Software have announced server-based Web interfaces for their OLAP
servers.

Users with only a browser on their desktop can use MicroStrategy's
DSS Web to connect to DSS Server and perform the same sophisticated
data analysis as if they were connected locally. Arbor plans a
similar gateway for its Essbase OLAP server. And both plan to
integrate Java applets into their systems.

READY FOR WHAT COMES NEXT

The history of technology has taught us once again that predicting
the future is a difficult task, at best. The Internet and intranets
are still in their nascency and changing so rapidly that it is
impossible to predict what will transpire over the next year, much
less an even longer time period. Every new medium is used first as
a better way to do that which has been done before. The first cars
were merely more expensive and, of course, horseless versions of
the carriage; radio was used to send telegraphs without Morse code;
television was used to transmit radio programs with visuals added;
computers were used to automate counting and calculation.

In each instance, an individual or small group figured out some new
and different purpose for the new invention. Still, that process
took time. We see the same happening on the 'Net. It provides
faster, simpler connections to data.

Companies can set up electronic commerce systems to sell tickets,
flowers, or music without the need for direct human involvement on
their end (setting up these systems still requires a great amount
of human involvement, but that will change soon enough).

Others have set up radio stations. Down the road are plans to send
movies and television shows down the wires. But none of these are
new. The real uses of the 'Net are still out over the event
horizon.  LAN

NETWORKS: The Human Factor

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

When analysing successful and unsuccessful helpdesk
implementations, I discovered seven key attributes that the best
helpdesk practices exhibit.

 Helpdesk implementations are driven by management.

 It must distribute and discuss metrics using reports.

 Call management is centralised.

 IS staff must embrace the helpdesk tool.

 Management must define and quantify its expectations of the IS
staff.

 Helpdesk staff must be accountable.

Let's now discuss each factor briefly. For the first, it is
apparent that the managment must realise the benefits of a helpdesk
system. If management does not take ownership, the staff won't be
motivated to use the tool. Management must stress the importance of
using this system to create a knowledge base.

Distribution and discussion of metrics. Unsuccessful helpdesk
systems adhere to the paradigm "Garbage In, Nothing Out." This lack
of reporting, or metrics, usually occurs because the folks setting
up the system spent more time figuring out how to get the staff to
use the system than they did determining its value.

A manager requires staff to enter all trouble calls in the
database. However, once all the calls are logged, he doesn't know
how to mine the data for useful information, which he can then
present to superiors. When staffers realise they are entering calls
but not receiving any feedback on their performance, they stop
logging calls. To be successful, a helpdesk system must present
meaningful data to the staff and management.

Centralised call management. The helpdesk can log calls only if
they come into the helpdesk. While most helpdesk packages allow
network administrators to enter tickets, these folks are less
likely to enter records. This situation is compounded by the fact
that users usually know who to call directly to get their questions
answered. As a result, numerous calls go unreported. This
information call routing can undermine the system and adversely
affect projected staffing levels. To close this informal channel,
some organisations tell their administrators to put their phones on
"send." As a result, users reach a live person only if they call
the helpdesk.

Get IS staff to embrace the helpdesk. Most helpdesk implementations
fail because of a What's-In-It-For-Me mentality. IS staffers
usually see helpdesk tools as one more task to juggle during the
work week. Management must show the staffers the value the software
provides. Often, a disparity exists between the manager's desire to
get meaningful reports out and the staffers desire to spend time
entering that information so managers can extract it. IS staffers
don't see how this process affects them. Management must show them
how these tools will reduce their workload.

Defining expectations. A manager must specify which tickets should
be closed within an hour and which ones could be closed within a
day. Some tickets, by definition, take longer to close. For
example, if IS has to order software before it can be installed on
a user's machine, that ticket may stay open a week. However, taking
a week to answer a spreadsheet question is unacceptable.

Manages should define their expectations of IS staff in writing.
One way is to draw up a contract between the helpdesk and end users
that spells out the service level agreement between the two
parties. If managers do not define these parameters, how do they
know whether the helpdesk is meeting or exceeding users'
expectations?

Accountability. Helpdesk implementations can fail because people
start to believe that using the tool is optional.

So, how can management ensure that employees use the helpdesk
system? Money and status usually do the trick. Managers can use the
helpdesk as a tool to base performance reviews. Future raises and
promotions will be determined by how well each individual meets the
service levels managers have set. If staffers "forget" to close
calls, they will not be given an opportunity to "back date" the
ticket.  LAN

NETWORKS: Electronic Troubleshooting

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Storage Dimension, a US$60-million provider of RAID and tape
storage systems for LANs, wanted to set up an automated help desk
to provide quick response to users' inquiries. To do this, Storage
Dimensions turned to Apriori GT, a knowledge-based software
foundation program from Platinum Technology.

Using Platinum's Apriori GT, Storage Dimensions designed its own
method of Internet access for customer self service, called
TechConnect.

TechConnect is designed to help resellers, field service personnel,
customers, and other networking vendors access documented solutions
for commonly asked questions about Storage Dimensions' storage
products.

Customers can access the easy-to-use TechConnect help system 24
hours a day via the Internet (techconnect@xstor.com) or via private
online services. The knowledge base automatically provides users
with detailed, context-sensitive information on installation,
compatibility, and support for any Storage Dimensions product, as
well as related products from a wide variety of vendors. To access
this information, users simply send an e-mail message from within
his or her existing mail application describing the problem.

"The TechConnect knowledge base has a dynamic feedback loop," says
Bill Kirkwood, director of customer service and support at Storage
Dimensions. "It is constantly monitored by technical support
specialists and engineers. All problems or issues are analysed, and
resolutions are fed back into the knowledge base.

As a result, solutions are consistent and readily available to
support specialists and customers alike. The system automatically
prioritises solution documents based on frequency of use, which
speeds up resolution to the customer. In this way, trends are
discovered, and the customer becomes part of the product
development process."

Today, 25 per cent of Storage Dimensions' support inquiries come
via the Internet and up to 75 per cent of those calls are resolved
by the customers on their own (see figure).

The helpdesk staff's workload has been reduced by about 20 per
cent. Storage Dimensions paid approximately US$160,000 for the
Apriori GT and a Sun Microsystems Sparc 670 MP server; the company
achieved return on investment in less than a year. Storage
Dimensions estimates it has saved more than US$200,000 annually in
the two years Tech Connect has been online, according to Kirkwood.

TechConnect utilises the same documents that the Storage
Dimensions' technical support representatives rely on daily to
resolve 99.4 per cent of customer support inquiries. Kirkwood
points out that users now have access to these same documents via
the Internet.  LAN

NETWORKS: Dialing for Help

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Sometimes it takes a little help to make a little help. Here's how
to design an internal helpdesk that will keep your burgeoning
networks under control.

esigning a smoothly working, professional, yet cost-efficient
helpdesk support function is not an easy task. There are many
potential pitfalls to avoid.

A successful helpdesk planning project must tackle some tricky
issues, such as planning for future growth and changes in
technology and laying out provisions for the project's final
implementation.

Experts agree that the key to a helpdesk that will achieve first-
rate operation is adequate planning during the initial design
phase. This stage is when the project's team members must estimate
the current helpdesk needs and predict the near-term challenges the
helpdesk will face once it is in place. These initial plans include
important factors-such as expected growth in the number of computer
users, new applications that will need to be supported, and new
technology issues-that will impact the helpdesk during its first
years of operation.

The first step during the planning stage is for management to
ascertain that a helpdesk function is actually needed. It may be
that increased user demand for assistance is due to unusual
circumstances, such as a heavy staff turnover, an influx of new
trainees, or installation of new hardware or software. In these
cases, the temporary need for increased end-user support can be
fulfilled by other, less-costly methods.

Generally, you can easily assess your company's need for a
dedicated helpdesk when informal, ad hoc help provided by your
technical staff becomes a burden for them and disrupts their usual
activities. According to Stephen Davies, president of U.S. Computer
Group, a US-based supplier of support services, the proliferation
of departmental and companywide LANs within the corporate
enterprise is driving the need to support multivendor nodes, open
systems software, and diverse applications. This proliferation has,
in turn, led to a growth in end-user demand for assistance. This
type of support requires complex problem analysis to resolve
increasingly sophisticated computing problems, making ad hoc end-
user support a monumental task.

If your staff is no longer able to satisfy users' requests for
support on an informal basis, whether it's due to an overwhelming
number of support requests or a need for support that is beyond the
support staff's capabilities, it's time to begin to plan for a
helpdesk.

Matt Kochan, vice president of marketing and business development
at Digital Equipment, suggests that you watch for these telltale
signs that an organised end-user support function is necessary:

There is a large Data Processing staff
turnover (which indicates possible
staff-member burnout).

MIS receives poor marks from end
users (registering unhappiness among the users).

User productivity takes a dive (which could signal users'
frustration with technical tools).

If any of these symptoms are occurring, a helpdesk may be needed.

IN COMMITTEE

If it is determined that a helpdesk is needed, management's next
step is to proceed to the planning and design stage by forming a
helpdesk project committee. Delegates from company management, MIS
personnel, and end users should all be part of the helpdesk
development plan. It is important that each affected group be
involved in the helpdesk initiative for it to succeed.

The committee concept allows management, users, and support
personnel to jointly iron out helpdesk functions and expectations,
thus avoiding misunderstandings about what types of support will be
available. The committee should determine exactly which functions
the helpdesk will provide, define its functionality level, and
decide which applications, systems, and equipment will be
supported. Staffing and training requirements, hours of operation,
and budgets should also be addressed. With all parties in
agreement, anticipation of what the final helpdesk implementation
will provide will be clear, and the committee can formulate the
helpdesk's charter.

The next step is to investigate the benefits and drawbacks of an
internally operated facility vs. an external helpdesk. There are
three viable options for the implementation and management of a
helpdesk: the helpdesk function can be an in-house entity, it can
be completely outsourced, or it can be a hybrid operation that uses
both in-house staff and an outside service provider.

In-house helpdesks give you complete control over operations,
training, staffing, and costs. However, administration costs can be
high, and you will need extra time and staff to manage the
operation.

Despite the drawbacks, many small organisations may still want to
choose an internal helpdesk, explains Harvey Walker, general
manager of US-based integration firm Extranet Telecommunications.
Walker says his firm often recommends its clients do exactly that.

"If you deal with a constantly evolving product and you have to
continually train outside staff, the costs can be extremely
expensive," says Walker. "Extranet's clients are mostly small
software and Internet access companies with changing product lines.
Because of this, we usually suggest they go with internal
helpdesks." It's quicker to train internal people on the different
product changes when they are already familiar with the products,
he explains.

In a totally outsourced helpdesk situation, the helpdesk vendor
manages the entire problem resolution process. This resolution can
be done at the customer site or remotely from a designated helpdesk
facility. The vendor runs all phases of the helpdesk operation at a
predetermined cost, which benefits the customer. Of course, the
customer relinquishes all control over the operation. Training can
be challenging, as well; it is more difficult for outside people to
keep up with the constantly changing conditions of your LANs.

In a typical hybrid helpdesk solution arrangement, the outside
vendor manages the helpdesk's operation, call response, and problem
isolation process. The resolution of the problem is relegated to
the onsite staff or a designated service vendor. There are
administrative cost savings to be gained from this type of
arrangement, but you give up control over the helpdesk's management
and usually have the added disadvantage of a helpdesk facility that
is located far from your users.

There are many reasons why your company may choose to use an
outside vendor to provide its helpdesk needs.

It may be that there is a lack of technical expertise in your
company's ranks. Your company may be going through a period of
reduced growth, or management may have made a strategic decision to
dedicate resources to the company's core business. In such cases, a
total outsourcing agreement is appropriate. If the company's users
are spread out across a large geographic area or dispersed among
many locations, a remote helpdesk may be more appropriate.

TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE

Once you've decided whether your helpdesk function will be
internal, external, or both, the next step is to define in detail
the level of service the helpdesk will provide.

Says US Computer Group's Davies: "It is extremely important to
obtain companywide agreement on what the helpdesk will and won't
do. Inflated user expectations and exaggerated claims of technical
resources will result in a disappointing end product, dooming the
helpdesk."

Clearly define the level of service the helpdesk will provide and
either distribute it in a report or circulate the proposed helpdesk
charter. A basic helpdesk answers telephone calls from users,
dispatches technical assistance, and tracks problem resolution. A
midlevel helpdesk tackles low-level problem-solving by asking the
caller basic questions about the problem and walking him or her
through its resolution. Problems such as downloading files, using
e-mail, or finding a lost document are easily handled in this
manner. High-level helpdesks are staffed with skilled technicians
who are capable of using remote diagnostics and expert system
packages to examine a complex system problem and resolve it.

The level of helpdesk that is best for your organisation depends
upon the capabilities of your in-house or outside vendor service,
the organisation's size, the technical competency of the user base,
and the amount of the allocated budget. Setting up high-level
support is expensive. Software costs alone can range from US$2,000
to US$7,000 per user; consulting and train ing fees average an
additional US$1,500 per day. Add these costs to the amount you will
spend on hardware, space, and labor, and you will see how
staggering the start-up cost can be.

hidden costs

There are hidden costs involved, as well. Don't underestimate the
amount of resources you will need to start and run a top-notch
helpdesk. Your start-up costs will include staffing, training,
equipment, telephone services, software, and floor space. Expenses
for training, in particular, will be ongoing. (For more
information, see "Help Yourself." For a look at a successful
helpdesk implementation, see "Electronic Troubleshooting" on page
80.)

The top priority of the planning team is to design a helpdesk that
is extremely easy for users to access-if it isn't, users will
bypass it. Users should be able to access the helpdesk with a
single telephone call. After the usual logging data (name,
location, computer type, and software used), the caller should be
able to describe the problem and be walked through the solution.

Davies advises that to ensure that the help is beneficial and
remains attractive to users when they need assistance a user-
feedback mechanism should be built in to the system. Successful
helpdesks need a scheme for gauging user satisfaction and
effectiveness. With out user feedback, the only way to grade the
operation's usefulness is through the opinions of those who work on
the helpdesk itself, which would certainly result in a subjective
evaluation. Users' satisfaction with the helpdesk can be reported
and measured in formal, companywide surveys, joint IS and user-base
meetings, or via e-mail to a designated ombudsman. Whatever means
you employ to judge users' perceptions of the helpdesk operation,
it should be performed at regular intervals on a continuing basis.

Designate a high-level manager (or management team) to oversee the
helpdesk's operations. The manager must continuously review overall
helpdesk procedures and make necessary adjustments to meet new user
demands (for example, user load increases, technology enhancements,
and operational time changes to support disparate, and worldwide
sites). Planning for this important function should be done during
the initial design stage.

Management reports tracking the user's initial call, helpdesk
action taken, and final problem resolution should be easily
obtainable. These reports will ensure that the helpdesk can quickly
adapt to users' changing needs, which is critical to its success.

Collect data that details the number of calls received (per hour,
day, week, and month), the total time taken to arrive at a
successful solution, and the number of calls that were successfully
resolved by the helpdesk vs. the number of calls that were
escalated to alternate support. These statistics should be tracked,
tabulated, and reported regularly. The helpdesk manager needs this
data to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the helpdesk
function, and the information can be used to adjust staffing,
training, and hours of operation, as necessary.

There are a number of software packages available that can help
document these types of data (see related story "Help Is on the
Way," page 67). Small companies can buy an off-the-shelf general
helpdesk software product with the needed features built in for
less than US$5,000. Larger companies, with more than 25
workstations, can expect to pay about US$1,000 per user for a
package.

DEATH BY OVERKILL

According to the helpdesk Institute, companies frequently make the
mistake of not understaffing but actually overstaffing their new
internal helpdesks. Start small and increase staff and hours of
operation as needed. Automation is playing an increasingly large
part in helpdesk services as LAN support becomes more complex. New
programs are constantly being made available. These programs
automate the helpdesk call handling process, bringing it down to
its simplest level: symptom, problem, and resolution.

Relying too heavily on automation is a common pitfall of new
helpdesk func-tions. With so many helpdesk products available, this
trap is easy to get caught in. Automation is good up to a point: It
reduces costs, allows users to access the helpdesk around the
clock, and, when used correctly, it provides efficient problem
resolution. But don't forget that, in general, people prefer live
communication with other people as opposed to computer automation.
If users are too often asked to dial up and "talk" to a machine,
they'll stop using the helpdesk no matter how efficient its
problem-solving abilities.

CAN'T GET ENOUGH HELP

Many helpdesks are already providing services and support in areas
other than problem-solving and trouble call management. Inventory
management, contract administration, user training, and
documentation distribution are all examples of services now being
handled by the typical company helpdesk.

For many organisations that now depend on their LANs for daily,
ongoing business activities, the proper staffing and operation of a
helpdesk has become as critical as the proper staffing and
operation of the marketing department. The technical tools are just
as crucial. Whether your helpdesk operation is to be basic, medium-
level, or high-level, it must be planned correctly to obtain the
proper combination of people and technology.  LAN

NETWORKS: Help Is On The Way

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Help desks are commonly viewed as expendable. But functionality and
upcoming standards may show that supporting internal users makes
good business sense.

The grim reality of corporate life in the 1990s means companies are
resorting to layoffs, cutbacks, and even going out of business.

This dilemma is being felt on a large scale in internal MIS
departments, which often have to make do with a fairly small staff
no matter how many employees need to be supported. The crisis is
compounded at the helpdesk level, where often only a handful of
individuals is charged with solving the everyday computing problems
of more employees than they can adequately manage.

While many IS departments view the helpdesk as expendable and focus
cost containment measures in this area, this decision can come back
to haunt them in the form of reduced employee productivity.

In other departments, the helpdesk may be sacrificed in favour of a
company's external customer support infrastructure, which may be
viewed as a bigger contributor to the firm's bottom line.

But with a relatively fragmented structure, no dominant player, and
dozens of proprietary products, the helpdesk market seems to be
going in many directions at once with no clear destination.

Partly to bring some cohesion to the market, several organizations
are working on standards that will provide a uniform means for
passing helpdesk data between various users and that will create a
way to import and export knowledge. This combined effort of
multiple companies will give users better information regarding the
importance of helpdesk software to an internal IT infrastructure,
as well as information as to how spending money on such resources
will actually result in a return on investment.

THE BOTTOM LINE

When IT managers find out that the total cost of ownership (the
initial price plus cost of maintenance) of just one PC can be
thousands of dollars over a few years, many start slashing funds
for what they consider nonessential items. Sometimes this means
cutting financial support for the helpdesk. But sacrificing this
asset could be equivalent to throwing the oars off a sinking boat
to make it lighter.

With a restricted helpdesk infrastructure, employees are limited to
waiting around for a member of the IT staff to show up in person to
troubleshoot their problem. Alternatively, they may ask a coworker
for help, which could cost more money in lost productivity than it
does to maintain that workstation.

A key way to do more with less is to literally enable end users to
help themselves. Most helpdesk software vendors realise that the
fewer relatively mundane calls a support analyst has to field, the
more time and energy he can devote to more severe incidents.

Instead of losing users in an endless loop of automated telephone
voice menus, it is more effective to give them control over when
and where they request information by using the World Wide Web and
an ordinary Web browser (see figure, page 76). If a user has a
question about importing an Excel chart into Word, for example,
rather than attempting to locate the appropriate information in a
manual, he may be able to surf over to the helpdesk through the
corporate intranet and type a few key words to find an answer.

For more complex problems, an individual could create a trouble
ticket and dynamically interact with it before sending it via e-
mail to the helpdesk system and waiting for an analyst to call (see
"Answers Online," page 77). The trouble ticket might be customised
depending on the department or business unit.

Using the Web to resolve IT problems may not supplant the old-
fashioned method of picking up the telephone, but giving users
options can only contribute to the efficiency of the helpdesk.

BRANCHING OUT

In many organisations, the helpdesk is used to route calls and keep
track of who called and with what type of problem. But because most
companies can't dedicate a staff to running the helpdesk, this
entity has started addressing IT-related functions, including asset
management, inventory management, and training administration.

"In the past, asset management might have been under the operations
department and the helpdesk might have been an offshoot of customer
support, but now helpdesk, systems support, asset tracking, and
inventory fall under the same umbrella, and are all under MIS,"
says Bruce Law, executive vice-president of US-based Bultema.
Bultema is an organisation that works with helpdesk and support
vendors to develop business, product, and marketing strategies.

By integrating inventory tracking functionality into a helpdesk
system, IT staff can take calls from users and have immediate
access to each user's desktop environment.

Some helpdesk packages also integrate with change management
applications, which aid in the administration and management of
moves, adds, and changes that can occur after an office move or a
companywide software upgrade. This way, the helpdesk database
always includes information regarding which employee has which
equipment and where they are located.

This integration between the helpdesk and other applications can be
seen in products from all the major helpdesk and support software
vendors in the market. One example is SA-Expert Advisor from
Software Artistry, a problem and call management product that's
part of the company's SA-Expertise suite of automated support
solutions.

The suite contains a variety of modules that users can add as their
needs warrant. These components include an asset management
application, a change management solution, and a component that
integrates the product's support functions with network management
platforms.

Another combination of offerings includes helpdesk software with a
software product that searches for answers to questions or
problems. Utopia Technology Partners' Utopia Resolve/

CBR2 is a joint venture between Utopia, a helpdesk automation
software vendor, and Inference, a provider of software developed to
search and retrieve information in a variety of applications.

The product works with Utopia's HelpDesk to combine problem
resolution and call tracking. Once a call has been logged using
Utopia's HelpDesk, a case-based reasoning session initiates to help
the user solve his or her problem.

Scopus also uses Inference's technology in its CasePoint Link
product, a case-based reasoning module that integrates Inference's
CasePoint search engine and Scopus' products. CasePoint Link
prompts users with a series of questions, the answers to which then
allow the product to search various databases to come up with a
solution.

Clarify's ClearSupport product goes a bit farther by integrating
inventory management with software distribution-an asset for large
enterprise networks with thousands of computers to support and
administer. Clarify's system unites with Microsoft's Systems
Management Server, resulting in a simplified method of distributing
and updating Clarify's helpdesk application. Centralising and
automating software distribution helps lower the cost of running a
helpdesk.

Clarify also features integration with Tivoli System's Tivoli
Management Environment systems management suite. Earlier this year,
Tivoli announced Tivoli/Plus for Clarify, a software module that
integrates Clarify's support product with Tivoli Management
Environment.

DKSystems' DKHelpDesk for Windows includes a project management
feature that tracks the movement of existing equipment and the
installation of new equipment. It also integrates with OnTrack for
Training, the company's training administration and management
software.

In the long run, this integration between the traditional helpdesk
application and various management components can help reduce the
total cost of ownership, which can be important for IT departments
on a lean budget.

Another helpdesk innovation that brings efficiency and possible
lower costs to IT departments is integrating telephony capabilities
into support software. This integration can provide information
about a caller and solutions to prior incidents involving that
caller.

Professional Helpdesk (PHD) announced earlier this year a module
called PHD Automated Attendant, which is built into the company's
PHDEnterprise and PHDPremium helpdesk software products. The
products support Novell's Telephony Services API telephony
standard, which allows PBXs and servers to connect to each other
and pass information back and forth. Helpdesk analysts are able to
instantly obtain information that can help them resolve problems
faster and more efficiently.

Vantive uses a process called database routing, which the company
positions as different from traditional screen pops. "This concept
provides value to the caller, because when someone calls in, the
system asks them for their [telephone] extension, and then it goes
to the database. Depending on the information, the system might put
the caller to the front of the queue, or it might route the call to
the appropriate person," says Bob Tate, vice-president of marketing
at Vantive.

SECOND BEST

Corporations whose primary business is selling products to
customers know the value of an external customer support system. In
fact, many major internal helpdesk software vendors also provide
products that are used primarily for external customer support and
service.

The situation many companies experience is one in which more time,
effort, and funding goes to this external support infrastructure
than to the company's own internal helpdesk. "Clearly there is a
correlation; if you support the external customers well, you gain
revenue benefits," says Scott Webber, president and CEO of Software
Artistry. However, he adds, although the gain in revenue from
outside customers may be more direct, employees are also customers.
"With both internal and external customers, you have issues and
problems that need to be addressed. And if IS doesn't provide
quality support [to the internal customer], the customers have
[other] choices," he says.

Although an internal department may not be viewed as a customer, in
many cases the business unit, for example, does contribute
financially to the IT department. This transfer of funds may be
mostly paper based, but it's a business deal nonetheless. If a
department feels the helpdesk isn't adequately addressing its
needs, it can choose to outsource its support needs, thereby taking
away business-and funds-from the helpdesk.

"With service, you are dealing with one customer at a time and
making sure they are satisfied, whether they are internal or
external," says Bultema's Law. "But the helpdesk is mission
critical in both cases."

Many support software vendors don't see this link, but once they
realise that their own people are crippled, that will change, says
Barbara Noti, senior analyst for application development strategies
at the Meta Group. "As vendors who are leaders in external customer
management also sell to the helpdesk, you'll see people derive the
benefits," she says.

Some in the industry go beyond a relationship between internal and
external customers toward consolidation of the internal helpdesk
with the external customer support infrastructure. "In the past,
you may have had a high-end, robust support solution for external
customers and a lackluster one for internal [customers], but now we
see they are coming together in a centralised approach," says Law.

This merging might be in the form of a support center, under which
any type of support issues can be addressed. With such
consolidation, the internal helpdesk can only benefit because the
external applications usually receive more attention.

STANDARD PROCEDURE

With close to 200 companies developing and shipping helpdesk and
support software, the lack of cohesion in the marketplace is no
surprise. Most helpdesk products are based on proprietary
technology with no established method of communicating with each
other.

One exception may be the support many major vendors have shown
toward manufacturers of knowledge bases. These are products that
load into helpdesk software and contain information about a range
of issues and known problems associated with different hardware and
software products. One example is ServiceWare's Knowl edge-Paks,
which come in versions that cover a variety of systems, including
Microsoft Word, Lotus Notes, NetWare, OS/2, and the World Wide Web.

Helpdesk vendors realise the value of such prepackaged knowledge
bases, and more than a dozen of them have established relationships
with Service Ware to OEM Knowledge-Paks with their own helpdesk
software.

The Molloy Group goes the extra mile and not only repackages
Knowledge-Paks under its own Knowledge Cube line of content
databases, but also modifies the products to work with the
company's Cognitive Processor. The Cognitive Processor is a
technology that enables the company's Top of Mind helpdesk software
to learn from each call that's logged. Upon integration, the
Knowledge Cube databases can make Top of Mind "smarter" about
certain topics.

Other than the support most helpdesk vendors have shown for
ServiceWare, the industry lacks meaningful standards that could
make it easier for helpdesk analysts to share information across
multiple helpdesk platforms and improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of support products. To this end, the Desktop
Management Task Force (DMTF) has announced the Support Management
Working Committee (which is charged with developing a standard for
exchanging electronic service tickets) and a standard that will
outline the content and structure of knowledge used by support
systems.

The Support Management Working Committee is chaired by Patrick
Bultema, president of Bultema and former chair of the US-based
Helpdesk Institute. Bultema found that many CEOs in the support
market were interested in hard-hitting advice about where their
companies should go and how they should position their product
lines. "We look at overall trends in the industry and focus on
innovation and transforming businesses in the area of high-tech
support," Law said.

The current method of exchanging information in helpdesk
troubletickets partly fueled the formation of the committee. When a
user has a problem, he or she calls the internal helpdesk. There,
an analyst generally opens a trouble ticket in which key
information about the call is logged. This ticket remains in the
onsite database, so if the problem is too big for the analyst to
handle and the call is escalated to the systems integrator, the
information can't be readily exchanged. Often, the integrator must
open a new trouble ticket and enter the information all over again.

If the problem is too big even for the integrator and the call is
further escalated to the vendor, the process occurs again. "Each
step you have a person on the telephone creating a service ticket,
with no way of sharing the information and passing it along," Law
said. Many organisations do use e-mail to exchange trouble ticket
information, but that information, unaccompanied by a form
document, doesn't always make sense.

The committee is looking at an Electronic Document Interchange
standard for passing along service ticket data and emphasises that
it is not trying to replace the way service tickets are used.
Rather, it is attempting to define a standard way of moving these
tickets among systems.

This effort will most likely involve creating a common platform for
sending and receiving electronic trouble tickets, a data format for
sending these tickets, and a transport mechanism. Mechanisms under
consideration include e-mail and Internet protocols.

"This standard will allow people to say that even though they have
different systems and different information in their trouble
tickets, at least there is a common way of exchanging this
information," Law said.

Although knowledge bases are very useful when employed in
conjunction with helpdesk software, they are, nonetheless,
generally built on proprietary formats. Support organisations do
have access to vast amounts of knowledge, but exchanging this
knowledge can be cumbersome because there's no standard way to do
it.

The DMTF committee plans to create a standard for content,
structure, and exchange of knowledge, which will make it easier to
share such information among a variety of systems. The standards
committee, which includes vendors such as Astea, Digital, Hewlett-
Packard, IBM, Inference, Intel, and Vantive, plans an aggressive
timetable, with standards slated to be in place by early 1997.

MARKET SHAKE-UP

With the progression of both the standards movement and the effort
to educate customers on the importance of deploying and maintaining
a helpdesk infrastructure, the next step might constitute a major
industry shake-up. In an environment where so many vendors are
vying for a piece of the pie, inevitably some will drop out of the
race, and others will be taken over by larger companies.

In the past year, Astea International acquired Bendata (another
major player in the market) and McAfee took over Vycor. More such
mergers could be in the works, thus reducing the number of
competitors in the support market.

The support industry started out simply tracking calls, it then
moved to identifying who was on the call, then integrating with
problem management and other applications, and finally the industry
moved to sophisti cated knowledge tools that empower end users. But
the industry is still very proprietary, with almost 200 companies
and no market leader.

As long as industry players make the effort to find common ground
and let IT departments know their internal customers are as
important as their external ones, most organisations will be in a
better position to do more with less and still meet their budget
requirements.  LAN

NETWORKS: A Choice of Tech Support Tools

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

What happens when your remote sites go down? What tools do you need
to extract troubleshooting information? Show those techs a thing or
two.

he process of dealing with network troubles seems to unfold in six
stages. Stage one: You realise that something is wrong. Stage two:
You call your VAR. Stage three: Your VAR sends a technician. Stage
four: You describe the problem to your VAR. Stage five: The tech
fixes it. And finally, stage six: Everyone is happy.

The only hard part in this process is stage five. You expect the
proverbial knight in shining armor to arrive on his white horse and
slay the dragon. Instead, here comes the haggard tech-a little
hunched over-with a laptop and a briefcase full of tools, hoping at
least to find the dragon, never mind kill it.

Even when this method is successful-and the so-called dragon is
slain-it still leaves you with a handful of problems. Stages three
through five are expensive. If you employ your VAR via a
maintenance agreement, you're spending money. And the technician
may have actually used your problem to learn something useful. But
the next newbie who faces the same problem will have to start from
ground zero. Anything you can do to minimise the time it takes for
that tech to complete the service call benefits both you.

Several companies offer diagnostic tools that help you find the
fault and perhaps kill the dragon. We'll take a look at some of
them and discuss what you can do in your own office to lower costs
and share knowledge.

Touchstone Software's WINCheckIt helps you examine a PC and
diagnose its maladies. It first examines the hardware on the
machine in question and produces a report. The report contains a
summary of all the devices known to the system. Detailed reports on
IRQ or DMA usage are available.

This program solves two common problems for technicians:
determining from the current environment what add-on hardware is
appropriate and cleaning the drives.

For example, let's say the technician needs to install another
adapter card on the workstation. The "Hardware" icon on the
WINCheckIt taskbar brings up a list of possible cards that might be
added to the machine. The tech chooses a Dialogic voice card;
however, this card cannot be installed in this specific machine due
to IRQ conflicts.

Sometimes, technicians are called in for a problem as simple as
disk space shortage. While WINCheckIt doesn't add capacity, it can
identify waste. The "Clean-up" button on the main screen tells the
program to look for duplicate files throughout the hard disk. Many
of them must remain in place.

For example, every machine has several SETUP.EXE and README.TXT
files, which should be retained. However, files are frequently
copied to create a "temporary" backup, then never deleted. The
cleanup function finds candidates for deletion, so you can clean up
the disk drives. Using this procedure, you can often recover 10 to
15 per cent of a disk's capacity. Of course, making a good,
verified backup before beginning spring cleaning is a smart idea.

Archiving wizard

Another product that helps you recover disk capacity is Synmantec's
Norton Navigator, which has an archiving wizard. It searches the
disk for files older than an administrator-specified date and lists
them. You can then use built-in tools to copy the files elsewhere,
or you can compress them into .ZIP files.

Sometimes, your problem stems from a missing or outdated driver or
module. Various options are available for supplying customers with
such items, and the costs incurred vary with each. Your VAR's
technicians should carry disks of common items, such as the latest
NetWare client software.

If you've standardised all your client configurations as much as
possible (for example, all clients receive SMC Ethernet NICs or
Adaptec SCSI cards), each technician must have a disk or two with
the latest software for these cards. Doing so will solve many of
your problems. Nevertheless, while the tech is at your site,
they're bound to be in need of something they left at their office.
There's a least one easy way to solve that problem.

If your technicians carry modem-equipped laptops with them-always a
sound idea-they shouldn't be caught without Traveling Software's
LapLink. LapLink is available in versions for DOS, Windows 3.x, and
Windows 95. The software connects over serial or parallel
connections as well as over LAN and Internet connections.

They can use LapLink to access files from their office while
they're on the road, but they must first set up a workstation at
the office to run it. The workstation must be logged in to the
server and dialed in to the local Internet access provider. From
their laptop, they can access the Internet and run LapLink to
connect to the LapLink workstation in their office.

To do successfully, they need their office workstation's IP
address. (That address changes every time a new Internet connection
is made.) Make sure the connection doesn't time out if it's idle
for just a few minutes. You also must be able to use telnet
services; some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) require an extra-
cost "shell" account for this purpose.

Once they have the files they need on their laptop, they can attach
the computer to your LAN and use LapLink to make a peer-to-peer
attachment to move the files. If a LAN isn't available, or if the
connections, topology, or protocol are different from what they
have, they can use LapLink in its parallel or serial mode with the
supplied cables. (Parallel mode is about three times faster.) The
parallel cable has male terminators at each end, so it can connect
to the parallel ports of two PCs. There is a handy converter that
changes the Centronix plug found on all common parallel printer
cables to a male, 25-pin, D-Shell connector in most computer
stores. With it, techs can use your printer cable to connect the
PCs.

For a VAR to support you from their site, ask them to try LapLink
Host. Helpdesk staffers can use LapLink Host to take control of
user workstations, allowing them to diagnose and fix problems
remotely.

CD-ROMS TO THE RESCUE

Several CD-ROM titles can help you minimise the time your techs
spend on support calls. The three most popular titles are Micro
House's Micro House Technical Library, Novell's NSEPro, and
Microsoft's TechNet.

Novell's NSEPro has just about everything you'll need to support
NetWare and other Novell products. Think of the NSEPro as a series
of index cards, with some fact, file, or other nugget of
information on each one. Because tens of thousands of cards exist,
they're indexed and searchable electronically. The CD-ROM includes
all the files available from Novell's ftp site (ftp://novell.com)
and NetWire (Novell's CompuServe presence); the CD-ROM is published
eight to 10 times a year.

The Micro House Technical Library, updated quarterly, is a CD-ROM
encyclopedia containing information on NICs, system boards, hard
disk drives, and controllers. Its entries include graphics and
tables. You'll find this tool extremely useful in researching how
to set up hardware. If you have ever found yourself holding a
controller card, NIC, or motherboard without the accompanying
manual, this tool is a welcome solution.

The Technical Library is available in a network version (sold with
licenses that allow various numbers of concurrent users) and a
standalone version. Running the latter requires that a hardware
switch, called a dongle, to be attached to the parallel port of a
user's workstation. This stipulation is an annoying inconvenience,
but the value of the information outweighs it.

Microsoft's TechNet is also a two-disk set. Each monthly update
contains over 150,000 pages of current technical information, along
with the latest drivers and patches. It covers topics such as
client-server and workgroup computing, system platforms, database
products, and Windows and Macintosh applications. TechNet even
includes the entire Microsoft Knowledge Base, with over 50,000
questions and answers. The CD-ROM uses a Windows-based, full-text
search engine. Information is displayed in a scrollable,
prioritised list, and you can place electronic bookmarks in the
text, annotate topics of interest, and print directly from the
screen.

While you're loading up the CD-ROM server, throw on a copy of the
Windows 95 CD-ROM. After installing new hardware, you'll often be
asked for a file or two from that CD-ROM. Ask if your tech has a
copy, so that there is one permanently in his briefcase. With
LapLink, you can make all that information easily accessible. With
your LAN, use NETSETUP from the CD-ROM to make a Win95 directory on
the server. Doing so lets your own staff without CD-ROM drives
access those files easily.

STAY OUT OF TROUBLE

The last thing you want to happen is for an infection from another
of your VAR's customers to pass from the tech's laptop to your
workstations. You should run a server-based virus scanner such as
NetShield from McAfee. In addition, you should have a variety of
up-to-date scanners and disinfectors to test and clean infected
stations. Check the National Computer Security Association's (NCSA)
forum on CompuServe or the Computer Security Institute's (CSI) Web
site (http://www.gocsi.com) for a wide variety of products from
anti-virus program (AVP) vendors.

You should also get into the habit of using write-protected
floppies. If your VAR's techs are equipped with laptops, they
should be running a shield program at all times-no exceptions.
Remember, if they infect you, they have to spend a lot of non-
billable hours cleaning your systems.

HELP YOURSELF TO A HELPDESK

Many VARs contract with their customers to provide technical
support. In a large organisation, this service is called the
helpdesk. Smaller companies focusing on their business rather than
the technology that manages it often want to outsource their
helpdesk needs.

VARs are well positioned to support a dozen or a hundred clients,
just as a corporate helpdesk can support anywhere from a few to
numerous users and departments.

I believe that the ideal helpdesk hasn't been written, although
several have potential. If your organisation is large enough, I do
know that with a combination of products, you can build a helpdesk
that comes close to perfection.

Start with the core helpdesk software, One example is McAfee's DP
Umbrella. (This product was developed by Vicor, which was later
bought by McAfee.) In addition to the traditional helpdesk
functions such as tracking open items, escalation, and reporting,
DP Umbrella has several built-in features and add-ons. The Help
Desk Monitor is one of them, and it provides technicians a place to
log new calls. It automatically prevents duplicate entries of the
same problem by one caller (for example, if the caller has already
reported it).

If another user reports the same problem, the software adds that
call to the count of pending calls; when a solution is found, it
can be distributed to all users who suffer from that particular
problem.

Another built-in feature is called the White Board. Through it,
operators post messages about situations that may affect several
end users. All calls relating to a posted White Board notice are
linked together; they can be worked on, updated, and resolved
simultaneously. This collaborative computing tool lets technicians
learn from each other.

More importantly, it prevents several of your own techs from
working on the same problem at the same time in an uncoordinated
manner.

Among the DP Umbrella add-ons is Vicor Web. This tool lets the
helpdesk post common problems and solutions to an Internet or
internet Web site, so users can find their own solutions. This
feature can dramatically reduce the number of calls individual
technicians must handle, which cuts the cost of staffing and
managing the helpdesk. You can track helpdesk calls for reporting
purposes, and you can restrict access to various parts of the Web
site based on security clearances (or support levels). For example,
if your office has no oher technician on staff, you can get minimal
information, such as how to change printer ribbons, while your
offices with more savvy users can access updated drivers or other
files.

Another add-on product to DP Umbrella is Vicor listener, which
monitors network management consoles via its Simple Mail Transport
Protocol (SMTP) Listener. The software receives SNMP messages from
any system capable of e-mailing them, letting the helpdesk staff
act proactively to manage a problem before it becomes a crisis.

If you need to standardise management information, American
Megatrends recently introduced PC Care. This product fully exploits
the DMI technology supported by most BIOS vendors to offer
standardised system information.

PC Care collects information stored in the BIOS and puts it into a
standardised Management Information File (MIF) format. The program
then interprets DMI data into one of several formats, which an then
be converted to SMTP messages and sent to Vicor Listener.

In this process, problems brewing in one user's PC can be brought
to the attention of the helpdesk staff before the user even knows a
problem exists. These problems can be resolved in a planned,
scheduled manner rather than in crisis mode.

Few helpdesk products include inventory management and purchasing,
but I believe the Vicor product and Open UPTIME from Metrix do-and
do so quite well.

The Metrix product includes purchasing system and replenishment
capabilities, and it maintains a complete history record on parts
and products shipped (including serial-number tracking). It has an
add-on module called the Repair Center, which ties in a service
depot function so authorised materials can be repaired while
recording information for parts and labor billing.

The basis for receiving technical support is being prepared when
you do find a problem on your network. These tips and tools will
help you and your VAR's techs resolve the problem at hand and avoid
crisis situations.  LAN

NETWORKS: RUNNING YOUR OWN DNS

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

As your network grows, you may be considering the option of running
your own Domain Name System (DNS) servers.

We show you how to navigate the DNS structure.

ll hosts on the Internet- or on any TCP/IP network for that matter-
have an assigned 32-bit IP address. In addition, most hosts also
have a name, because names are easier to remember than addresses.
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the distributed database that
contains the names and addresses of all reachable hosts on a TCP/IP
subnet, including the Internet.

Most, but not all, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will set up
and maintain the DNS information for their customers. However, you
may prefer to operate your own DNS. Let's take a look at Internet
domain names and the DNS's structure and discuss how you can create
and maintain the DNS information.

INTERNET DOMAIN NAMES AND STRUCTURE

Internet host names use a hierarchical address structure that
comprises a top-level domain, a subdomain, and a host name. Top-
level domain names and IP network addresses are assigned and
maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA, USC
Information Sciences Institute), which is responsible for the DNS's
overall coordination and management. Domain administrators assign
host names and addresses within their domain. (For more information
on the IANA, contact its Web site at http://www/isi/edu/diz7/iana.)

The Internet naming hierarchy is best understood by reading a host
name from right to left. All host names end with a top-level domain
name (see Figure 1). Generic top-level domains (although generally
limited to the US) include the following: com (commercial
organisations), edu (educational institutions, primarily four-year
colleagues and universities), gov (US government agencies), mil (US
military), org (nonprofit organisations), net (network providers),
and int (international treaty organisations).

The host name smcvax.smcvt.edu, for example, is assigned to a VAX
computer (smcvax) within St. Michael's College's subdomain (smcvt),
which is within the educational top-level domain (edu). The name
golem.bill.com refers to a host (golem) in the Hill Associates
(Colchester, VT) subdomain (hill) within the commercial top-level
domain (com).

Other top-level domain names use international two-letter country
codes, such as au (Australia), ca (Canada), de (Germany), es
(Spain), fr (France), jp (Japan), mx (Mexico), and us (United
States). Each country determines its own countrybased subdomains
and how the associated DNS database will be organised.

The US domain, for example, is organised mostly on the basis of
geography, usually using a name with the following format:
organisation.city.state.us. The format may be slightly different
for special names, such as those for state government or K-12 and
two-year educational institutions. The address cnri.reston.va.us,
for example, refers to the Corporation for National Research
Initiatives located in the US.

The ca subdomain within the us high-level domain does not cause a
conflict with the ca high-level domain; the former refers to
California and the latter to Canada. The host name

myo.inst.keio.ac.jp refers to a system at the Science and
Technology Department of Keio University in Yokohama, Japan; note
that the ac subdomain within jp refers to academic institutions.

THE NAMING PROBLEM

Because host names are easier to remember than IP addresses, using
them is a convenience for the humans who use the network. However,
the network has to provide some sort of name-address translation in
order to operate.

Prior to the definition of the DNS, the HOSTS.TXT file was used in
the ARPAnet. It contained the IP address, name, and alias(es) of
every host on the ARPAnet. This scheme was suitable when the
network had only a few hundred systems and was not very dynamic.
But, it is wholly unsuited for the Internet, which has almost 10
million hosts (as of January 1996) and 10 percent growth per month.

HOSTS.TXT files are still used, however. Their main function today
is to contain the names of local systems, so one machine on a LAN
(or other local network) can find other local systems without
performing a DNS lookup.

When TCP/IP software is configured on a host, the location of the
HOSTS.TXT file must be provided if the file is used by a given
system.

Figure 2 illustrates a fictitious network: the foo.com domain.
Listing 1 shows a sample HOSTS.TXT file for this domain. Each line
contains three fields: the IP address, host name, and (optionally)
any aliases the system might use. For example, a system on the LAN
trying to make an frp connection to the local ftp server might
attempt to open a connection to 192.168.210.3, ftp.foo.com, ftp,
www, mail2, or dns2.

THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM

The DNS is a distributed database containing the names and/or
addresses of every host accessible via the Internet. The DNS was
one of the key developments that allowed the Internet to grow as it
has. Unlike HOSTS.TXT files, which must be maintained individually
at every host on the network and synchronised to ensure their
correctness, DNS files are maintained by thousands of hosts on the
network. Each host is responsible for a portion of the name space,
which is called a zone. The DNS provides a mechanism for
identifying backup databases in case the first one becomes
unavailable. DNS databases are updated automatically, so
information on one name server does not remain out-of-date for
long.

When TCP/IP software is installed on a host, the address (not the
names) of one or more name servers (usually no more than three) are
one of the configured parameters. When the host attempts to
establish a connection to another IP host, it first checks its
local HOSTS.TXT file (if there is one) for the name of the remote
host. If the remote host is not the HOSTS.TXT file, the local host
sends a query to the primary DNS name server. The primary name
server might not contain the information about the particular
destination host; in that case, the query is forwarded to another
name server higher up on the domain name hierarchy.

Consider the following example. Suppose a user on a system at Baz
University (domain: baz.edu) wishes to initiate a connection to the
Web server at Foo Corp. (www. foo.com). The following name
resolution steps would occur:

1. The Baz host checks its HOSTS.

TXT file. In this example, Foo's Web server is not found.

2. The Baz host then checks its primary DNS name server. Because
the Baz DNS server probably covers only the baz.edu zone, it does
not contain Foo's Web server address; instead, it forwards the
query.

3. The query is passed to a name server higher up in the DNS
hierarchy. A database exists for every top-level domain. The
database contains the name of every sub-domain within that top-
level domain and its assigned name server(s). When the higher-level
name server checks the com DNS file, it finds an entry for foo.com
and the address of its DNS server(s). This information is returned
to the Baz DNS server.

4. The query is then forwarded to one of the name servers for
foo.com, which, in turn, returns the IP address of the Web server
(198.168.210.3).

You can use several TCP/IP tools to examine the DNS. The most
common DNS lookup utilities are NSLOOKUP and Host. If you turn off
the "recursive" option, you can see these steps in more detail.

The DNS database contains different types of information on
resource records (RR). Following are descriptions of the most
common RRs.

Start of Authority (SOA) records indicate the authoritative name
server for a given domain and a few additional administrative
items.

Address (A) records supply the IP address for a given host name.

Canonical Name (CNAME) records supply host alias names. You can
define multiple A records for a given address, providing alias, or
alternate, host names. It is usually easier (and less prone to
human error) to supply one A record for a given address and use
CNAME records to define alias host names for that address.

Pointer Records (PTR) associate a host name with a given IP
address. These records are used for reverse name lookups.

Mail Exchange (MX) records define the mail system(s) for a given
domain.

Name Server (NS) records define the name server(s) for a given
domain.

DNS SERVER SOFTWARE

DNS server software has various names, depending on the operating
system. Windows NT refers simply to DNS, while Unix has named or
Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (BIND) boot files. When the DNS
process is launched, it will read a boot file that contains the
names of the database files containing the DNS information. Listing
2 shows a sample boot file, called named.boot.

The first record in the boot file contains directory information
and points to the directory where the DNS program files reside.
Each remaining record contains three fields that describe a DNS
database file: the type of DNS information, the domain defined in
the file, and the file name. The six records listed refer to the
DNS databases that this DNS server is primarily responsible for.
The six domains defined here are:

foo.com: The DNS entries for the foo.com zone, which contain
address, mail server, and name server RRs, are found in the file
foo.com.zone.

210.168.192.in-addr.arpa: The foo.

com domain is associated with the IP Class C address 192.168.210.0
(a valid IP address for use in a private network per RFC 1918).
Reverse lookups (obtaining the host name from an IP address) are
accomplished using a reverse database file. In this file, the name
of the domain is the reverse dotted decimal notation of the
domain's IP address followed by in-addr.arpa. (The latter is an
indication of the use of IP addressed within the ARPA address
assignment domain. This nomenclature is an historic holdover from a
time when more than one type of address could be found and more
than one addressing authority existed.) The file containing this
data is called foo.com.rev.

localhost: Localhost is a special IP name that always refers to the
local host and, by convention, has the Ip address 127.0.0.1. This
information is located in the file called localhost.zone.

0.0.127.in-addr.arpa: IP reserves the Class A address 127.0.0.0 for
local loopback. This address, therefore, is not maintained by any
global DNS registry. For completeness and security, we define the
reverse lookup for this address in a file called localhost.rev.

O.in-addr.arpa and 255.in-addr.arpa: IP reserves the all-zeros (0)
and all-ones (255) addresses for special purposes. These domains
are defined in all the all-zero.zone and the all-one.zone files,
respectively.

The final record defines where to find the DNS cache information
for the root domain (.). This is not a cache as in short-term
memory, but rather a set of fixed pointers to the higher-level DNS
databases. In this example, the cache information is maintained in
the file named.cache.

DNS RECORD FORMATS AND DATABASE FILES

All DNS resource records have a similar format. Although you can
find many shortcut notations and abbreviations in DNS files, I have
used examples with simple nomenclature to eliminate confusion and
ambiguity.

The first field in any DNS record is always either an IP address or
a host name. If this entry is missing, the name/address from the
previous record is implied. Note that all names and addresses end
with a trailing dot (.), which signifies that the name or address
is an absolute name/address rather than a relative one. Absolute
addresses, also called fully qualified domain names, are relative
to the root, while relative addresses are relative to a default
domain (which may or may not be the root). This field may,
optionally, be followed by a time-to-live (TTL) value, which
indicates the length of time the field's information field should
be considered valid.

The second field indicates the address type. In today's DNS
databases, the string "IN" most likely indicates an Internet
address. This field is present for historical purposes and enables
compatibility with older systems. The third field is a string that
indicates the type of RR. This field is followed by optional
parameters specific to the RR.

The foo.com.zone file, shown in Listing 3, contains information
about the foo.com domain, including name lookup, mail exchange, and
name server information. Specific RRs of note follow.

Notable rrs

The SOA record includes the name of the DNS server system and the
e-mail address of the person responsible for the name server. Note
that the e-mail address is not in the expected form; rather than
user@domain, the format user.domain is used. This record also
contains five other parameters.

1. The serial number identified the version of the DNS database.
Whenever the file's information is changed, the serial number must
be incremented so secondary servers examining this database know
the information has been altered. In this example, we use a serial
number format containing the year (all four digits), month, and day
of the last update. This numbering scheme is usually sufficient if
you don't change your DNS database more than once a day. Some
systems just start counting at 1 and increment it every time a
change occurs.

2. The refresh value tells the secondary name server(s) how often
to check for updated information (10,800 seconds is three hours).

3. If the secondary name server is unable to contact the primary
name server, it continues its attempt to make a connection at the
specified retry intervals. In this example, it will try once every
3,600 seconds, or every hours.

4. If a secondary name server cannot contact the primary name
server within the specified expire period, the secondary server
stops answering queries about this domain. The theory behind this
parameter is that at some point, the data is so old it might be
harmful-no answer is better than a bad answer. In this case, the
time period 604,800 seconds is one week.

5. The TTL value is returned with all responses to database
queries. It tells the requester (or other servers) how long the
information can safely be cached (86,400 seconds is one day). The
TTL value is the default value for all records in the file, it may
be overridden by a TTL value provided with a given RR.

NS records contain the address of the name server(s) for this
domain. In this example, two name servers have the foo.com DNS
information.

MX records contain the addresses of the mail exchange system(s) for
this domain. The number before the address is the preferred system.
When a remote user sends mail to user@foo.com, the remote mail
system looks up the MX record for the foo.com domain. the remote
mailer then attempts to establish an SMTP connection to the foo.com
mail system with the lowest preference value (in this case,
mail.foo.com). If that system is not available, the remote mailer
tries the next level mailer (in this case mail2.foo.com).

The A records contain the IP address associated with the host name
in the first field of the record.

The CNAME records contain the alias host names associated with the
host named in the first field of the record. Although you can
assign a single A record and many CNAME records to a single system,
be careful when doing so. Some mailers, for example, do
unpredictable things when asked to resolve an MX host name that
uses a CNAME record rather than an explicit A record. In the
following examples, the addresses of the backup DNS and mail
servers are specified with separate A records, even though they
point to the same machine.

GOING IN REVERSE

The database file for the IP address domain handles the reverse
lookups.

The records and their formats are essentially the same as those in
the previous examples, except that PTR records are used instead of
A records. PTR records contain a host name to associate with the IP
address that is in the first field of the record. The foo.com.rev
file that corresponds to the foo.com network is shown in Listing 4.

Listings 5 and 6 show sample localhost.zone and localhost.rev
files, respectively, providing forward and reverse address lookups
for the loopback address. Listings 7 and 8 show sample files for
the all-zeros and all-ones addresses. These files are provided only
for completeness and security.

Finally, if the local name server cannot resolve a name, the query
is forwarded to a name server higher up on the domain name tree.
The named.

cache file contains the addresses of the top-level DNS servers. You
should periodically download this file from the Internet Network
Information Center (InterNIC) at
ftp://rs.internic..net/domain/named.cache. (This file
is also called named.root and named.
ca.) Listing 9 shows an abbreviated version of the current
named.cache file. The single dot (.) indicates the root domain; the
"3600000" is the TTL value, indicating that these entries should
expire after about six weeks (3.6 million seconds).

WHY MAINTAIN YOUR OWN DNS?

If most ISPs are willing to maintain a DNS for their customers, why
would a company or organisation consider operating its own? The
most obvious and pressing reason is that not all ISPs will provide
this service.

However, even if the service is available, a site might want to run
its own DNS for other reasons. One might be to have more control
and to ensure the database's accuracy. If you constantly move
systems around, change host names, and/or changes IP addresses,
your ISP may not keep the DNS as up-to-date as you would like-or
need it to be.

Another issue is reverse name mapping; some ISPs keep reverse name
information only for servers-not the individual host systems. In
this case, users may not be able to connect to ftp or other
information servers that attempt to reconcile the user's host name
with the IP address. Furthermore, as your site grows in size and
complexity, your ISP may be unable to meet your needs.

AND THAT'S NOT ALL

Running a DNS is not terribly hard, but you must be careful when
creating the databases. You must update the DNS files whenever a
system name or address change is made. The serial number

must be appropriately updated whenever you make a change. The most
up-to-date named.cache file must be periodically downloaded from
the InterNIC. You also have to manage zone transfers, which is the
procedure for moving DNS data between primary and secondary name
servers. These procedures require planning. The example used in
this article is a simple case of a small LAN attached tothe
Internet. If you understand the DNS, you can manage your servers;
this way, you know the servers will be up-do-date.  LAN

NETWORKS: Performance Grading Gets Four Stars

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Microtest, in cooperation with industry leaders, introduced the
concept of performance grading-as opposed to simply identifying
pass or fail conditions-to provide a more accurate assessment of
the quality of Category 5 links. In the past, it seemed acceptable
to only know if a link passed or not. If you got a green light, you
considered the link to be OK.

A simple passing indicator was acceptable because different cables
appeared to have fairly equal performance factors. In fact, TSB-67
had been written with this binary form of testing in mind. Today,
however, the performance of Category 5 cables varies widely,
especially if you buy cable from more than one vendor. For example,
you may find that one vendor's cable barely passes TSB-67
requirements, while another vendor's cable tests the signal-to-
noise ratio 60 times better.

Performance grading has several advantages. For one, users can
differentiate marginally compliant links from superior links. This
ability helps identify those links that offer longer life and lower
transmission error rates and that support higher-speed
applications. Also, you can measure the product's quality, assuming
you obtain the cable from the same supplier (that is, the cables'
performance factors are approximately the same). Such data can help
you evaluate whether your cable installation team will need more
training before the next job.

Performance grading rates the quality of Category 5 links that pass
in terms of near-end crosstalk (NEXT). The idea here, similar to
standard NEXT tests, is to measure the amount of NEXT at a variety
of frequencies within the cable's operating bandwidth. The
difference is that the performance grade is based on a range of
acceptable NEXT values (in decibels) at each frequency.

As shown in the figure, Microtest divides the range of acceptable
NEXT values into seven quality bands, each 3 dB apart at the 100
MHz end of the spectrum. This tester indicates whether the link
passes, as well as the quality band within which it operates. For
example, a cable exhibiting performance shown in the figure would
pass at quality band three. If you're interested in upgrading your
existing PentaScanner to include performance grading, Microtest
offers the PentaScanner 350 upgrade kit.  LAN

NETWORKS: Reading the Cable Meter

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

A lot can go wrong beneath the casings of your network's coiled
connectors. Peek into your cabling infrastructure using these cable
testing techniques.

Did you ever take your car in for major transmission or carburetor
work, only to have the mechanic point out the belts showing through
what's left of your tires' tread? When dealing with a complex
system, it is sometimes the simplest component that we tend to
neglect. But when those components fail, the effect on the system
as a whole can be as devastating as a major component failure.

Network cabling provides a medium for the transport of data among
users, servers, printers, switches, and routers within your
network. Any cable that isn't contributing to the flow of data will
seriously degrade or even halt your network operations.

Inadequate cabling is one of the most common causes of network
problems, so don't take your cabling infrastructure for granted.
Cabling requires the same kind of careful troubleshooting,
monitoring, and maintenance routines that you implement for your
network's other systems. Not utilising preventive testing and
effective troubleshooting procedures on your cabling will
eventually backfire on you. The results of such neglect will
certainly give you migraines and probably make you wish you had
chosen a different line of work.

How do you ensure that your cables are installed properly and not
the cause of any network glitches? Whether you're checking a recent
implementation or trying to fix a problem on an operational
network, a cable tester is the most ef fective tool for certifying
whether the network's wiring is capable of transmitting data
successfully. The proper implementation of proactive testing using
a cable tester helps minimise network downtime and eliminates a
great deal of stress when cable problems do arise.

WHERE IT HAPPENS

Cable testing takes place within the Physical layer of the OSI
reference model. The Physical layer defines the transmission of
bits through a medium, and standards at this layer specify the
electrical characteristics of the signal, cable, and connector pin-
outs. As you know, the most written-about cable types today is
Category 5 UTP wiring, which supports the 100 Mbps data traffic
found in networks running on protocols such as Ethernet, Fast
Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI.

Most cable testers, such as Fluke's DSP-100, run tests to certify
whether a Category 5 cable installation meets the requirements for
passing data. Testers are available that allow you to test other
cabling media, such as multimode and single-mode optical fibre and
thin and thick wire coaxial cable. However, if you need to test at
layers above the Physical layer, such as the Data-link layer or
higher, you'll need a protocol analyser.

When should you perform cable testing? The obvious answer is when
users begin to experience problems, but that type of reactive
problem-solving is not desirable, especially for cable testing. Any
cable testing procedure you attempt after problems have already
occurred will certainly be pressured and stressful. And even so,
users will often have to wait until you fix the problem before they
can return to work.

Sometimes these situations are unavoidable, however. When you find
yourself under the gun to restore the network's functionality due
to an emerging problem, such as slow or no response from network
resources, your first step should be to utilise your network
management software or protocol analyser to determine the part of
the network that is at fault. If the cabling and connectors are
identified as the culprits, a high-quality cable tester and knowing
how to use it will prove invaluable.

By far, the best time to test your cables is immediately after
they've been installed. This proactive testing philosophy will pay
off by minimising problems that could plague your network in the
future and by making the process a more pleasant experience for
you. Concentrate on testing before problems occur-not only once the
installation is complete, but periodically, as well. Preventive
maintenance is your greatest ally against network problems of any
kind. The result will be a more reliable network and much happier
and productive users.

COMMON CABLE FAULTS

It's worth repeating that cabling problems rank very high as the
cause of networking troubles. Mechanical elements, such as cabling,
connectors, and wall plates, tend to fail more often than active
electronic devices such as network adapters and switches. It's also
much easier to make unnoticeable mistakes when installing wiring
and connectors. Thus, if you're experiencing connection problems or
excessive delay, there's a good chance the cabling infrastructure
is at fault.

Of those problems that do stem from cabling and connectors,
approximately 85 per cent are caused by a faulty installation, not
from product defects. Cable installation errors come in all forms.
For example, a technician working on the corporate telephone system
could accidentally snip a network cable, or a cable installer could
improperly attach a connector to the cable or exceed distance
limitations for a particular cable run. These errors may have a
large or small effect on the network, depending on which user or
server cable was cut or improperly installed.

Intermittent problems are generally caused by improper splices,
poor connector attachments, lack of termination, and corrosion. A
cable will maximally transfer the energy of a data signal as long
as the impedance within the cable remains constant. However, a
signal encountering a sharp change in impedance will produce
reflections. Reflections occur when a signal is reflected in the
direction from which it came, causing a potential collision with
itself or another signal.

Reflection occurs most often when there is lack of termination on
the cable. Cable terminators are there to absorb the power and
dissipate it as heat, making the cable seem infinitely long to the
traveling signal. If a terminator is missing, a signal will reach
the end of the cable and be met with a difference in impedance in
the air that surrounds the cable's exposed end, causing a
reflection. In addition to lack of termination, improper splices
and poor connector attachments may cause reflections.

Cabling ailments can also cause excessive attenuation, decreasing
the amount of signal power that reaches the receiving device. This
situation causes the signal-to-noise ratio to decrease, leading to
greater transmission errors.

In very few instances, the cable you buy may not meet
specifications. Even if you buy from a reputable vendor, there is
that chance that the cable you've purchased has severe
imperfections. Therefore, you should make it a habit to test the
cable before installation.

CABLE TEST LINEUP

Before you purchase or utilise a cable tester, you should
understand what they can do. First of all, cable testing is
intrusive, meaning you can't support normal data traffic over the
cable while running tests. Of course, if you're in the middle of
implementing the cable plant, there won't yet be any users. But, if
you're troubleshooting an active cable segment, you will have to
bring down the cable on which you are working. Lastly, and more
importantly, cable testers that comply with the Technical Services
Bulletin (TSB) -67 standard, which was approved in October 1995 by
the EIA/TIA 568A committee, perform a series of four tests to
ensure your cable installation is adequate.

These tests are: Wire map, link length, attenuation, and near-end
crosstalk (NEXT). A new offshoot of cable testing, performance
grading, may be of help, as well (see "Performance Grading Gets
Four Stars").

The wire map test ensures that a link has proper connectivity by
testing for continuity and other installation errors. Continuity
tests verify that the wire is not broken and that physical
connectivity exists throughout the connectors and cabling. Thus,
the wire map test will tell you if, as in our previous example,
someone accidentally cut the cable. Sometimes during installation
the installer may inadvertently fail to connect the wires on one
connector pin to the corresponding pin on the opposite end of the
cable. This, of course, will not facilitate a connection-the wire
map test verifies proper pairing of wiring on opposite ends of the
cable.

The twisting of wires in UTP minimises induction of current flow
from other devices that may be emanating electromagnetic waves,
such as nearby wires. A Category 5 cable includes four individually
twisted pairs of wires. If you don't wire your RJ-45 connectors
exactly according to a standard, such as EIA/TIA 568A, T568A or
T568B wiring scheme, then you may produce split pairs. A split pair
occurs when you attach the connector in such a way that a wire pair
consists of one lead from one twisted pair and another lead from a
different twisted pair, creating a pair of wires that are
untwisted. The split pair configuration provides a path for data to
flow, but problems can occur. Of issue is the resulting untwisted
wire pair, which will encounter an excessive amount of external
noise interference and crosstalk, causing transmission errors.
Cable testers do a good job of detecting the existence of split
pairs.

Link length measurement tests tell you whether the cable meets the
length requirements specified by the T568B cabling standard. Cable
testers use a device called a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) to
determine the length of a cable. The TDR also indicates if there
are any improper cable splices or terminations.

As shown in Figure 1 (page 54), The TDR tests cables based on the
principle of reflections. The TDR connects to an end of a cable the
technician wishes to test, then sends a signal throughout the
cable. This signal reflects off changes in impedance, especially at
the end of the cable, and the amplitude of the reflected wave
corresponds to the degree of impedance mismatch.

The TDR records the amount of time between the test signal's
departure and its return, which constitutes the signal delay. It
then calculates the distance to the reflecting point based on the
speed of the signal and signal delay.

Several products on the market today run TDR tests on metallic or
fibre optic cable. For example, the Tektronix TS100 Option 01
Metallic TDR tests LocalTalk; Type 1 and Type 3 cables; Category 3,
4, and 5 cables; and thin and thick coax cables. This test set
finds shorts, ends, and breaks in the cable. The Tektronix TFP2A
Fibermaster Optical TDR (OTDR) tests single-mode and multimode
fibre optic cables.

A data signal loses power while traversing the length of a cable.
This loss of power is called attenuation. For metallic and fibre
cabling, attenuation increases linearly as a function of cable
length. However, radio signal attenuation increases exponentially
with greater distances. If too much attenuation is present between
source and destination, electrical noise becomes significant and
transmission errors will occur more frequently. Attenuation tests
help you identify problems such as manufacturing defects and
corrosion.

Many LANs, including Ethernet and Token Ring, utilise digital
signals to carry information among network devices. A digital
signal contains a series of discrete voltage levels that represent
the 1s and 0s of the data signal. In the time domain, which you can
render visually with an oscilloscope, a digital signal appears to
contain only DC (0 Hz) characteristics, such as positive 5 volts
for a logic 1 and negative 5 volts for a logic 0. However, a
digital signal's sharp changes of amplitude cause the signal to
contain very high frequency components. You can observe this effect
by viewing the signal's frequency characteristics on a spectrum
analyser.

In addition to cable length, the amount of attenuation is also a
function of frequency. Most cables will offer more attenuation to
higher frequency signals than to lower frequency signals. Thus,
cabling acts as a low pass filter, smoothing out the sharp edges of
the digital signal.

Cable testers examine attenuation by measuring the effects of
sending a series of signals that step through the cable's operating
frequency bandwidth. For Category 5 testing, most cable testers
cover bandwidth ranging from 1 MHz to 100 MHz by taking readings in
1 MHz increments. This process certifies whether the cable meets
specifications in the part of the frequency spectrum where the
signal mostly resides. For Category 3 links, the frequency test
range is 1 MHz through 16 MHz.

The cable tester will report a passing grade if all frequencies
pass specifications. If a cable fails, the tester will tell you the
frequency at which it didn't meet requirements. Some testers also
indicate the amount of attenuation per foot. Cable testers are
available that work with metallic or fibre cable. For example,
Microtest's PentaScanner measures attenuation (as well as many
other impairments) on Category 3, 4, and 5 cable, and AMP's AM9100
tests single-mode, multimode, and plastic fibre cables for
attenuation.

NEXT is a specific case in which signals at one end of the link
interfere with weaker signals that are coming back from the
recipient. Current flow resulting from the difference of potential
impressed by the data signal consists of electrons that move
through a metallic wire. This stream of electrons creates an
electromagnetic field around the wire that may induce the flow of
electrons in an adjacent wire. This crossing of the signal into a
different wire is called crosstalk.

You may have experienced voice signal crosstalk while talking on
the telephone, probably in the form of another audible con
versation occurring during a telephone call. Sometimes crosstalk
occurs if you add a telephone line to your home and utilise both
telephones at the same time. The close proximity of the wire pairs
allows the signals to cross.

Causes of crosstalk generally include improper wire placement and
inadequate shielding. The twisting of wire, as is the case with UTP
cable, offers some resistance to crosstalk and other interfering
signals. Shielded twisted pair and coaxial cable offer a further
degree of protection. But fibre optic cable is completely immune to
crosstalk because fibre uses light rather than current flow to
transport the data. The flow of light through the fibre's core does
not produce an electromagnetic field that couples to nearby fibres.

In addition to crosstalk, networks may encounter the induction of
external electrical noise. This noise can become significant in
relation to the signal power, setting up the potential for errors.
The noise that causes these problems within network cabling is
usually Gaussian or impulse noise. Gaussian noise has nearly
uniform amplitude across the frequency spectrum and primarily
results from thermal conditions in the atmosphere. Impulse noise,
though, is typically the outcome of human-made devices such as
light switches, spark plugs, and heating coils. Impulse noise
typically occurs in short blasts, causing transmission errors to
occur in bursts. As with crosstalk, external noise produces an
electromagnetic field that causes unwanted currents to flow through
metallic data cables.

The amount of NEXT varies erratically as you sweep through the
operating bandwidth of a cable. For an accurate measurement, cable
testers record NEXT by stepping though the cable's operating
frequency range at very small increments. For Category 5 cable,
TSB-67 recommends a maximum step sise of 0.15 MHz for lower
frequencies and 0.25 MHz for higher frequencies within the 1 MHz
through 100 MHz frequency range. It requires a fast instrument to
test the hundreds of samples.

Fluke's DSP-100 handheld cable tester is a fast performer of NEXT
tests. The DSP-100 utilises digital signal processing to increase
its speed and to allow samples to be taken at close 100 KHz
intervals. The DSP-100 performs all tests required by TSB-67 for a
four-pair cable in under 20 seconds. This tester not only
identifies the presence of crosstalk, it also locates its source.

SKEWING THE DATA

The use of plenum cable continues to grow. However, there has been
a shortage of the Teflon that manufacturers use as a protective
cable coating. As a result, cable manufacturers now use a non-
Teflon coating on one or two of the four pairs in Category 5 cable.
These cables are known as "3+1" or "2+2" cables. These cables fully
meet Category 5 crosstalk and attenuation requirements, but the
difference in coatings offer unacceptable skew. Skew is the maximum
difference in propagation delay between the pair in a cable.

According to a white paper developed by Microtest, the use of 3+1
and 2+2 cables makes it vitally important that your cable tester
measure skew to avoid inaccurate length measurements and other
troubles. Because cable testers base the length calculation on
delay, the skew will introduce a range of lengths. For example, a
tester may report lengths 97, 97, 99, and 108 metres for each of
the four pairs of a 3+1 cable.

The problem of skew is more significant than simply causing some
bizarre length readings. Several high-speed LAN technologies, such
as 100Base-T4 and 100VG-AnyLAN, employ all four pairs of the
Category 5 cable. These schemes disassemble the signal into several
parts, send them down separate pairs, then reassemble the signal at
the far end. These standards expect each part of the signal to
arrive at the distant end at about the same time. However, if one
part of the signal leads or lags the others by too much, the
receive buffer cannot keep up with information transfer.

The 100Base-T4 skew requirement is a maximum of 50 nanoseconds;
however, some experts suggest a skew of no more than 35
nanoseconds. The TIA is expected to incorporate skew test standards
within a year. Today, Microtest provides upgrades to users of their
tester, PentaScanner, free of charge to include the capability to
measure skew.

A cable tester is a requirement to effectively implement and
maintain your network.

If you don't already have one, you should add a cable tester to
your toolbox. As with all network troubleshooting, the key is to be
proactive in testing to avoid problems cropping up at inopportune
times.  LAN

NETWORKS: Fault-Tolerance and Fault-Resilience

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

How tolerant are your networks? How much downtime can you really
afford? Don't live in a glass house: Here are several products and
strategies that improve network integrity.

100 per cent fault-tolerant network is a goal that can be
approached but never achieved. According to a white paper from
Vinca, a developer of fault-protection technology, "Downtime costs
are significant. The typical PC LAN is unavailable to all users 1.6
hours per week. In a 300-user network, this downtime costs
US$840,000 per year in productivity losses." Network Integrity,
another manufacturer of fault-resilient server software, estimates
the cost of a single server's downtime to be in the range of
US$50,000 to US$170,000 per year.

Today, networks are supporting a greater number of mission-critical
applications such as international financial arbitrage
transactions, where any downtime can cost millions of dollars.

GIVE 'EM THE RAS

Today, a relatively new industry in high-availability networks is
emerging. It focuses on eliminating single points of failure to
provide networks that are reliable, available, and scalable.

High-availability or RAS networks run the gamut from those that
must be available 99.99 per cent of the time to those that can
tolerate minor downtime while redundant components initialise,
providing 98 per cent availability. The spectrum runs from fault-

tolerant, where any network fault can be tolerated without taking
down the resource, to fault-resilient, where downtime is measured
in seconds to minutes. The fault may momentarily interrupt network
resources, but the resiliency of the network allows the resource to
become available with minimal downtime.

Integrators can configure hubs, switches, bridges, and routers with
passive backplanes, redundant power supplies, and management
modules so they do not become single points of failure. The network
topology can be configured to route traffic to mission-critical
resources via alternate paths. Some newer topologies, such as FDDI,
implement redundant rings on the same network.

I categorise server failures into five primary areas:

Application/NLM failures causing the server to ABEND;

Network operating system ABENDs;

Failure of disk drives, controllers, and NICs;

Power supply failures; and

System electronic component failures (such as memory and
motherboards).

In time, technology has made great strides in relation to the
integrity and availability of server data storage. RAID technology
allows data to be stored redundantly across several physical disk.
With redundant power supplies, controllers and channels in the disk
subsystems, and hot-swappable drives (drives that can be replaced
without taking the disk subsystem off-line), data storage is no
longer a point of failure in the network.

Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), backup generators, isolated
circuits and alternate electrical power points-of-presence in newer
buildings tend to eliminate raw electrical power as another single
point of failure in a network.

SERVER SAVERS

Most server hardware manufacturers offer redundant power supplies.
Error correcting memory prevents memory error failures. Many
network operating systems offer the ability to configure multiple
NICs on the same segment, preventing a NIC from becoming a single
point of failure. Multiple disk controller cards can be configured
to RAID systems to eliminate these circuit boards as a single point
of failure. The server's motherboard and processor remain the
largest single point of failure on the network.

Servers are prone to several kinds of failures. Hardware failures
are the first that come to mind, and they are the easiest to
address. Component redundancy is the first line of defense. Server
redundancy is the second. Many solutions exist for server
redundancy, from hot-spare servers to servers mirrored via high-
speed links.

Other types of server failures are harder to address. Today, the
most common server failures come from the server NOS or application
ABENDs. Fault-tolerant solutions that mirror each server
transaction are prone to mirroring the errors that led to the
ABEND, leaving a hole in the fault-tolerant armor. In some
situations, fault-resilient solutions that provide hot spares or
live, hot servers (servers already booted and waiting to replace
the failed server) actually provide better fault-tolerance.

Early attempts to make servers fault-resilient involved configuring
them with external redundant disk subsystems. Integrators could
configure the system so that hot spares (or redundant servers
provisioned with sufficient memory), NICs, and disk controllers
could be swapped with failed servers. The network administrator
simply needed to switch the disk subsystem and network cables to
the hot spare and reboot the server. However, this process had a
significant drawback: time. Identifying and swapping out a failed
server could take several minutes. Today, with many gigabytes or
even terabytes of storage in a disk subsystem, rebooting a hot-
spare server might take up to 30 minutes.

If you can tolerate that much downtime, this fault-resilient
solution is the most economical. And its significant advantage over
other fault-resilient implementations is that a single, redundant
server can be a hot spare to many active servers.

MIRROR, MIRROR

More advanced solutions provide server mirroring or clustering
between servers and multiported disk subsystems via high-speed
links. A mirrored server can take over the operation of a primary
server if it becomes unavailable. Mirrored solutions come in both
fault-tolerant and fault-resilient implementations. If the mirrored
server takes over and users are unaware of the change, the system
is fault-tolerant. In a fault-resilient solution, either the server
has to reboot or users need to reinitialise their login,
application, or transaction.

Another advantage of the mirrored/clustered server approach is
protection against natural disasters. By placing mirrored servers
in separate geographical locations, you can mitigate the effects of
such events.

Many network software applications handle fault-resilience
autonomously. For example, database servers (Oracle, Sybase,
Microsoft SQL, and so on) often have a transaction rollback option.
Before a user updates, modifies, or deletes a record, a "snapshot"
of that record is written to a transient area of the disk. If the
update is successful, the snapshot is disregard.

If a failure occurs during the update process, the database rolls
back to the snapshot information. The snapshot is written back to
the appropriate records when the database again becomes available.
This process ensures database integrity for almost any fault-
tolerant/fault-resilient solution. Novell's NOS implements
transaction tracking-its version of transaction rollback-as a
general file attribute.

Novell was one of the first proponents of fault-tolerance and
fault-resilience; in the early 1980s, it outlined a strategic
direction called System Fault Tolerance, or SFT. The company
quickly delivered SFT levels I and II; SFT III was delivered seven
years later.

SFT I, named Hot Fix, involves redirection of bad disk blocks. SFT
II, known as Disk Mirroring or Disk Duplexing, provides hardware
redundancy for the disks. SFT II was the forerunner of RAID Level
I. SFT III implements server mirroring. Two servers connected via
high-speed media provide redundancy for most NOS functions. If one
server suffers a hardware failure, the mirrored server takes over
operation without interruption or data loss.

SFT III is a reengineering of NetWare, dividing its functionality
into two distinct parts. The NOS's hardware-specific functions,
such as disk drivers, NIC drivers, or print servers, are included
in the Input/Output (I/O) engine on the server. The I/O engine is
unique to each server in a mirrored pair. The remaining logical
functions of the NOS are included in the Mirror/Server (M/S)
engine, which is common to both servers. The I/O engines are linked
to the M/S engines by a series of four queues. The servers are
physically linked by a high-speed medium called the Mirrored Server
Link (MSL).

While this solution provides true fault-tolerance, it is limited to
mostly hardware-oriented failures. According to Vinca, recent
studies show that 70 percent of server failures are due to software
disjunction. Runway NLMs or NOS errors will likely be duplicated in
both the primary and mirrored servers. Furthermore, I/O engine
functions such as server-based print services, routing (such as
TCP/IP), and Macintosh support will not be mirrored. If these
components fail, manual intervention is needed to reconfigure and
redeploy the system. Configuring alternative resources to the
server for network print serving or TCP/IP routing may make SFT III
a tighter, fault-tolerant solution. NetWare 4.1 SFT III addresses
the TCP/IP and Apple protocol problems.

SFT III is an elegant solution. It provides true hardware fault-
tolerance in the NetWare environment. It is a well-established,
secure environment for tested and stable server applications.
However, one drawback of SFT III is cost. An SFT III solution
cannot be clustered in a one-to-many mirrored server configuration,
but only as a one-to-one, primary-to-mirrored server solution (see
Figure 1).

BEYOND SFT III

While Novell led the pack in the small to medium uniprocessor
server environment, NCR developed a fault-resilient solution called
LifeKeeper. LifeKeeper is designed for the Unix operating system
and all NOSs that run on Unix, including Microsoft LAN MAN LMX and
NetWare for Unix.

LifeKeeper, an add-on to NCR's Unix, lets up to eight clustered
symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) servers share an external disk
subsystem. Each server can maintain its own space on the sub-system
or share space with the other processors. The servers maintain
redundant links and monitor the heartbeat of the other servers via
the SCSI bus, EIA serial connections, and the network media (see
Figure 2).

The servers may be configured in an active-active or active-passive
configuration. In the active-active scenario, each server acts as
an autonomous server. If one of the active servers fails,
LifeKeeper switches applications and communications interfaces to
another active server in the cluster. This server performs the
functions of the failed server as well as its own. In the active-
passive scenario, the passive server does no processing of its own;
it waits to take over for a failed server. The system may be
configured in an n+1 design, with one passive server for up to
seven active ones. The servers need not be the same size as long as
they reside on the same segments and have sufficient memory.

Because LifeKeeper servers are constantly running and monitoring
the heartbeats of other servers, they do not have to reboot as the
affected server.

The LifeKeeper server takes over the failed server's disk and
handles TCP/IP readdressing, so users remain connected and logged
in to the "new" server. However, because the secondary server does
not maintain the failed server's cache, users must resubmit current
transactions or reattach to current server-based applications.

Because a minor time delay occurs between the primary server going
down and the secondary one taking over, and because users have to
reinitialise their applications (not their server connections),
LifeKeeper is a fault-resilient, not a fault-tolerant, solution.

Vinca offers a fault-tolerant hardware/software suite that runs on
many manufacturers' servers. StandbyServer 32 is a server-mirroring
solution that connects a warm, on-line secondary server directly to
the main file server. Data is automatically mirrored to the standby
machine via a high-speed, dedicated link that does not add traffic
to the network. When the main server fails, StandbyServer 32
automatically switches operations to the secondary machine. Users
are back on-line in a matter of minutes. StandbyServer 32 runs on
NetWare, Windows NT, and OS/2 Warp.

Microsoft depends on server vendors and third parties to provide
fault-tolerant/fault-resilient solutions for Windows NT servers.
NCR recently launched two add-ons for fault-resilient NT servers.
The company migrated many of its Unix RAS features to NT and is in
the process of porting LifeKeeper to it. You can buy LifeKeeper for
NT as an add-on to the operating system. A version of LifeKeeper
Lite is included free with NCR's OEM version of Windows NT.
LifeKeeper Lite provides one-to-one server mirroring, but it does
not accomplish TCP/IP readdressing. As such, users are required to
log in to the "new" server. Vinca's StandbyServer is also a server-
mirroring solution for Windows NT.

USING A STAND-IN

Stand-in technology enables one server to stand in for a failed
server. When a server fails, the stand-in server immediately
appears to be another, specific server on the network. Users can
continue working in their current applications; however, access to
other files is slow. A stand-in server must reboot to gain access
to files that were not in use during the crash. A secondary NetWare
server can appear to be a primary one if you reboot it under the
primary server's name. The caveat, though, is that this rebooting
process can take up to 30 minutes.

Network Integrity's LANtegrity product is a hybrid of stand-in and
fault-

tolerant technologies. With the product, one server can instantly
appear to be one of several protected servers. The stand-in server
technology is layered on top of data vault technologies, which
create and maintain a secure, managed storage hierarchy of all
current and historical data.

In addition to presenting itself as the downed server, a stand-in
server must make users' data instantly available. LANtegrity does
not use data-mirroring or multiported data storage technologies;
instead, it uses another software piece called Intelligent Data
Vault.

To enable recovery from any kind of failure-even those that corrupt
data-the data vault is "archival," which means the data vault
contains the current version of data plus earlier versions, all of
which are accessible during stand-in.

LANtegrity's stand-in server presents an identical security and
file system image to the downed server's users while continuing to
be the LANtegrity server to the other protected ones. The
LANtegrity server is never rebooted and can support multiple downed
servers. It maintains an image of the server's memory.

The stand-in image of the downed server is created by manipulating
the incoming file access communications packets. Users can continue
working on their files, but the server may have to reconnect to get
access to other files.

Network Integrity's solution does not involve a significant amount
of disk storage. The Intelligent Data Vault organises itself into a
self-managed storage hierarchy. The most recently active data
resides in its disk, which acts as a cache at the top of the
storage hierarchy. All current protected data is available via a
high-capacity tape autoloader. Earlier versions of files and
deleted files are migrated to a managed, off-line shelf storage on
tape.

Stand-in technology takes the top two components of this storage
hierarchy and makes them appear and operate identically to the
downed server's file system. This process is significantly slower
when accessing files not in cache at the time of the server
failure. Earlier versions of files can be "restored" from the
LANtegrity server into its own stand-in image of the failed server.
Even if the failed server's software corrupted a file while downing
the server, an earlier version of the file is available for use.

The data vault layer poses significant technical challenges when
collecting and managing the data. To maintain a reasonably current
image of all the protected data at a manageable rate, traditional
backup methods are unacceptable; they depend on "full" backups,
which create significant network traffic. LANtegrity's data vault
never copies the same file over the network twice. Only changed
files are copied. As a result, replication opens the door to
continuous protection.

LANtegrity is an example of a fault-resilient solution that
provides full, immediate (within 15 seconds) server access (clients
must reattach and log in) but not full server functionality. The
transactions, applications, and files in use just prior to the
server failure are immediately available.

HARDWARE FAULT-TOLERANCE

Fault-tolerance/fault-resilience is not limited to just the network
operating system or its add-ons. Many hardware vendors include
fault-tolerant features as part of their hardware designs.

For example, NetFrame Systems introduced two fault-tolerant
technologies in its serves: MultiProcessing Parallel Server
Architecture (MPSA) and Gemini. MPSA is built into every
ClusterServer. A system of redundant components, combined with
every high data throughput, minimises downtime-scheduled and
unscheduled.

In Gemini mode, two Intel 100 MHz Pentium processor/ cache modules
operate in tandem. The secondary module backs up the primary one,
instantly taking over all operations in the event of a processor,
cache, or bus interface fault.

NetFrame's technologies also include Channelstart, which allows the
system to recover from transient I/O errors or failures; the
operation is transparent to users. All I/O transactions are safely
recorded while Channelstart clears the error condition, resets the
appropriate hardware, initialises the drivers, and resumes normal
operations.

Tricord Systems, a server manufacturer, markets a line of fault-
tolerant servers called Power-Frame. PowerFrame's design includes a
passive backplane to eliminate the motherboard as a single point of
failure. All active electronic components are isolated to
independent, intelligent subsystems that are hot-pluggable into the
passive backplane.

All subsystems can be redundantly configured or protected with hot
spares, so no major subsystem failure impacts the server operation.

Tricord was one of the first manufacturers to embrace Novell's SFT
III. The entire line of PowerFrame servers support full
implementations of SFT III on mirrored configurations.

CONCLUSION

Fault-tolerance/fault-resilience lets mission-critical systems
operate with minimal downtime, but it does not come cheap.
Redundant components eliminate many of the single points of
failure, but they almost double the hardware costs. Simple
arithmetic can determine whether the "statistically" projected
downtime costs justify the cost of a fault-tolerant or fault-
resilient solution.

Some many-to-one cluster "hot server" designs help lower the costs
per server. In the end, however, the critical nature of the
applications and the availability of data to the users will
determine whether you choose a fault-tolerant or a fault-resilient
solution.  LAN

NETWORKS: Beyond Static Web Pages

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Enhancing static web pages with dynamic media such as audio, video,
animation and interactivity.

When the World Wide Web (WWW) revolutionised the Internet with a
graphically-rich environment in the early nineties, the world
forgot that interactive multimedia delivered on CD-ROM discs was
far more dynamic and captivating. After all, the first web pages
was at best, static, with a few static and low-resolution graphic
images littered across text-centric content.

On the other hand, CD-ROMs were already filled with 16-bit audio,
multi-windowed QuickTime and MPEG video, as well as smooth 3D
animations and walkthroughs. Also, CD-ROMs often delivered
interactivity through the use of graphical buttons that provided
not only visual but audio feedback to the users. On the web, all
you could see then were hypertext links.

When Marc Andressen stepped out of the Mosaic world and started the
Netscape Navigator (or Mozilla) revolution, he created an
extensible web browser model that allowed third-party developers to
add plug-ins to it. Plug-ins for Netscape Navigator are similar in
concept to Adobe Photoshop plug-ins and Macromedia Director Xtras,
allowing enhanced features to programs without requiring complete
software recompilations and upgrades. The plug-in concept also
frees the main software vendors into focusing on delivering core
features without sacrificing execution speed. For example,
Microsoft is mostly guilty of designing programs that grow in
features but become cumbersome in size and speed.

It was not until Netscape Navigator 2.x that plug-ins became
viable. With the aggressive stance Netscape took in capturing the
web market, Microsoft retaliated with its own architecture, but
could not overturn the colossal tide that Netscape created in
capturing about 80 per cent of the web browser market. Today,
Microsoft concedes that its own Internet Explorer will always be
free for downloads and that version 3.0 will embrace Netscape's
enhanced features such as frame, Javascript and of course, plug-
ins.

What are some of the plug-ins available for Netscape Navigator
today?

The main plug-ins that are widely adopted include Macromedia's
Shockwave for Director 4 plug-in (several million downloads) and
Progressive Networks Real Audio (RA) plug-in. Other up-and-coming
plug-ins that we will discuss briefly include TotallyHip's Sizzler
plug-in, Geo's Emblaze, Acrobat PDF, and Macromedia's other
Shockwave versions.

Shockwave for Director 4.x is perhaps the most interesting for web
users, since it encases audio, animation, pseudo-video, and full
interactivity within a secure environment. We are already familiar
with frustrated users across the web who discovered the many flaws
of Java and Javascript, especially in the area of network security.
And since Java is an open architecture, malicious hackers have
already written many Java applets to attack networks.

Shockwave for Director 4.x is different. It uses a BASIC-like
scripting language known as LINGO, which has been "adjusted" for
the web to disallow most file input and output operations, thereby
reducing security risk to a minimum, far safer than Java and
Javascript. And because it encases all media components into a
compiled "applet", users will not be able to make changes to it,
nor will they be able to copy media components easily, unlike Java-
created animations, which are nothing more than a "flipbook" effect
created by calling a series of still images.

We should discuss Macromedia Director briefly so that you
understand its relationship with Shockwave. Director is a
multimedia development environment which uses the film production
paradigm, with a built-in scripting language LINGO.

When you have completed your multimedia production, you save the
file to the hard disk as an uncompiled document (.DIR format).
Under Director 4.x, you use the freely-distributed Afterburner
application to compress the document up to 60 per cent using the
LZW (Lempel Ziv) lossless compression algorithm, and save the
document as a Shockwave document (.DCR). Now the .DCR document can
be served on the web effectively through the Shockwave for Director
4 plug-in.

The next step for a webmaster is to ensure that his server allows
such MIME extensions. You simply include a single line in the
"mime.types" file in the "conf" sub-directory in your "httpd"
directory (see figure 1).

Notice that I have included several MIME types that we will talk
about here, including Real Audio (RA) and QuickTime Video (QT or
MOV).

After you have empowered your server to accept and deliver such
MIME types, you would allow your web pages to embed such data and
to allow non-compatible browsers to know what's going on.

First, note that it is a self-running Macromedia Shockwave for
Director 4.x web page featuring audio and animation (see figure 2).

In your HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document, you simply add a
line that EMBEDS the .DCR document and another line that allows
non-compatible browsers or Netscape browsers without the Shockwave
plug-in to see a static image using the NOEMBED command (see figure
3).

Here's another 2 web pages featuring interactivity with the user
(see figures 4 and 5 on this page).

You will notice that the HTML codes to drive these interactive .DCR
files are identical to the self-running version above (see figure
6).

Some of the constraints of the web means that when you author your
Shockwave documents, you must watch out for a few things. First,
bandwidth issues mean that you must try to optimise your graphics
down to as low a bit depth as possible. And try to reduce the frame
rates of your self-running animation to perhaps, 5 fps. Also,
Netscape does not reproduce all 256 colors in its internal color
palette, so you may have to optimise your 8-bit colour graphic
components down to 6- or 7-bits in colour depth.

Also, Shockwave does not recognise tempo settings in Director 4.x.
So if you need delays in your applet, you need to write LINGO
scripts with embedded DELAY settings. This can set back development
time somewhat since it can be quite tedious.

Another constraint for Shockwave is that unlike Director documents,
it does not support linked media. Therefore, you cannot link
QuickTime or AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) files to the main
document. And because QuickTime cannot be embedded like static
graphics in Director, you cannot really have synchronised video.

The workaround is to export QuickTime videos into 2 files, a PICS
file (a compiled series of static PICT images) and an audio file.
Within Director, import the PICS file and it will be laid out in
the SCORE window using the "CAST TO TIME" command. Then import the
sound file in Channel 1 and adjust the DELAY settings manually (see
figure 7).

Another popular plug-in is Real Audio from Progressive Networks.
Real Audio is a streaming technology which plays as it downloads.
This is beneficial for users connecting to your web site from 14.4
or even 28.8 Kbps modems, since line reliability may be
inconsistent and the speed is slow. Shockwave for Director
currently does not support streaming, and users must download the
entire applet before he knows its usefulness at all.

Real Audio uses a proprietary compression algorithm to compress
audio much more than traditional AIFF or AIFF-C or AU (Sun's native
as well as Internet's common Audio format). A typical AIFF file may
be more than 200 K while a RA file may be one-tenth of the size.
The chart attached (figure 8, page 42) shows the mechanics of how a
Real Audio server works.

From experience, the disadvantage of Real Audio, compared to
Shockwave, is that you need a dedicated server to serve Real Audio
content. If you do not own Real Audio Personal Server or Server 2.x
software, you cannot deliver content from your server. The
workaround is to allow downloadable Real Audio content, and expect
your users to fetch Real Audio players from the Real Audio site.

I have a web page on Jive Joint web site that features downloadable
Real Audio content, the easiest to deliver, although it requires
Real Audio applications on the client's end (see figure 9 below).

The embedded HTML commands look like that shown in figure 10 below.

Other notable up-and-coming plug-ins include Sizzler, Emblaze,
Acrobat PDF, QuickTime and Shockwave for other Macromedia
applications such as Freehand, Director 5 and Authorware.

Sizzler from TotallyHip is a streaming animation plug-in
technology. You can have animations that download and play
progressively (expect some jerkiness and rough, interlaced images
though). The Sizzler image conversion tool on the Macintosh can
convert QuickTime and PICS images into a streaming animation sprite
(.SPR). However, SPR files are much larger than Shockwave, up to
several times, and therefore take up much more space on a server.
The disadvantage of Sizzler is that it does not support embedded
sounds, and you must write a Java script to play sounds separately.
That defeats the purpose of multimedia on the web.

Emblaze from Geo is also a streaming animation tool which uses
Allegiant SuperCard technology to create vector-based animations.
Because it is vector-based, graphics and animations are smaller,
play better, especially on 14.4 Kbps modems. But the Emblaze
Creator (still in beta, and only available on the Macintosh) is
slow and clunky because it was created with a high-level tool,
SuperCard. And because Allegiant still has not delivered a cross-
platform of the SuperCard authoring environment, you are
constrained to author on the Macintosh environment only. The good
news is that Emblaze can play back from Windows (any version) and
Macintosh, and the plug-in itself is a far smaller download than
Shockwave for Director.

Who doesn't talk about digital movies lately? The most common form
of movies are QuickTime and MPEG. Because QuickTime is a far more
extensible technology and can have virtual reality (QuickTime VR)
as well, we will briefly mention it here.

There are several versions of Netscape QuickTime plug-ins available
today, including Apple's own QuickTime plug-in, KM's Multimedia
Plug, and MovieStar.

MovieStar is the most stable, and can work well with Netscape
Navigator 2.x, which most users have. Apple's own QuickTime plug-in
must work with Netscape Navigator 3.x or Gold versions, and since
these versions have yet to become popular, its use is restricted
for now. KM's Multimedia plug-in is only available for the
Macintosh and therefore cannot become mainstream for now.

Adobe has been competing fiercely with Macromedia on the multimedia
and image processing front lately. Adobe took a different approach
to delivering multimedia on the web, relying on its much-acclaimed
Acrobat Portable Document File (PDF) technology. Acrobat documents
today can have embedded movies and sounds, and allow simple
interactivity.

The downside is that Adobe's Acrobat 3.x technology, which allows
the Acrobat PDF Viewer plug-in, is still in beta, and its own Web
Presenter technology based on Adobe Persuasion is also in beta.
Most users are still apprehensive in adopting beta technology. With
the limited functionality of Web Presenter (a slideshow and
outlining tool), users are more comfortable with authoring on
Shockwave for Director now.

Macromedia has also launched Shockwave for Freehand, Authorware and
betas of Director 5. Freehand is an illustration tool, and
Shockwave plug-in for Freehand allows resolution-indenpendent
vector graphics to be viewed on the web. But its functionality is
probably restricted to graphic studios and advertising agencies for
now. Authorware is a computer-based training tool and the Shockwave
for Authorware plug-in, although capable of compressing Authorware
files, still cannot optimise it well for the web. Currently,
Macromedia positions Shockwave for Authorware for intranet
applications only. Shockwave for Director 5 will be a great
product, but is currently available for Power Macintosh and Windows
95 in betas only.

In the November issue, we will discuss in greater detail how to
optimise multimedia content for Netscape Navigator.  LAN

NETWORKS: HOTTER THAN JAVA: LUCENT'S INFERNO PROMISES TO TURN UP THE HEAT

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

This column's focus has always been on the Internet. This makes
sense, of course, because the Internet is networking's hothouse of
innovation. But other major public networks are out there: there's
cable television, the telephone infrastructure, and, for that
matter, there's cellular. At the edges of all these non-Internet
networks-at the point where you and I make our telephone calls and
watch our movies-the terminals are getting smarter.

What do I mean by "smarter"? I'm talking about better CPUs and more
memory. Still, even the upcoming generation of small gadgets won't
have enough horsepower to directly adopt Internet inno vations as
we know them. Java and the latest browsers, though they bring huge
possibilities to a broad range of traditional desktop computers,
require the equivalent of at least a fast 486 chip and a good 4MB
of available memory (that is, 4MB above and beyond the operating
system's own requirements) for high-quality functionality.

THINK SMALL

If you're building a telephone or a set-top box, you can't load it
up with a lot of silicon. You may want to put in a single SIMM's
worth of memory (which is about 1MB these days) and something along
the lines of a 386 CPU. You want to sell your devices in the
several-tens-of-dollars price range, not the several-hundred-
dollars range. And your target volume should far exceed the number
of Compaq Presarios in the world. After all, there are a lot more
small, consumer-oriented gizmos-such as Sharp, Casio, and Apple
PDAs; Sega game computers; smart telephones; and singing microwave
ovens-than there are desktop computers.

The one and only network software player-at least for now-in this
broad market of small, potentially networked gadgets is Lucent
Technologies (Basking Ridge, NJ). When AT&T recently split three
ways, it was Lucent that acquir-ed the bulk of Bell Laboratories
and, therefore, its expert knowledge. Bell Laboratories invented
Unix and C, so it's safe to say that the folks at Lucent know a
little about computers and networking.

Recently, the Bell folks announced a product they have been working
on for a couple of years-a software suite called Inferno. Inferno
can serve as one of two functions: on small machines, Inferno is an
operating system, and on desktop machines, it's a suite of
applications. This means that Inferno coexists with whatever
operating system a particular desktop machine uses.

On the desktop, Inferno occupies much of the same market space that
Sun Microsystems' Java does, although during the product's May 1996
announcement everyone on the Lucent team tried to downplay this
fact. Inferno's programming language (called Limbo) lets you build
the equivalent of Java applets.

The differences that exist between Java and Inferno might also give
Sun pause. First of all, Lucent claims that Inferno runs
comfortably within 1MB of memory. In addition, Inferno implements
network operating constructs that a language such as Java is not in
a position to implement. With Inferno, you get features such as
authentication and native file management (including exporting your
file system to other clients at will) right from the operating
system.

SON OF PLAN 9

Finally, Inferno draws on the research done at Bell Labs during the
development of the Plan 9 operating system (see "Plan 9: Son of
Unix," Interoperability, Summer 1996 issue, page 41) to create an
operating system that distributes all over the network the various
kinds of work that an application performs. For example, Inferno's
browser splits its onscreen presentation away from all the data
management issues such as looking up domain names and figuring out
where to draw images within a page of text. This way, slower
terminals can focus on what you see and can off-load the CPU-
intensive work to CPU servers located back at the service
provider's shop.

Distributing the various tasks that have to be performed in order
for a client to make a presentation is an enormously powerful
concept and one with which Bell Labs has grappled for several
years. "We looked at what we had done with [the] Plan 9 [operating
system]," says Rob Pike, key Inferno developer, "and realized that
if we stripped it down to just the distribution capabilities, we
would have something very small and very powerful."

A lot remains to be seen, but there's no question that Lucent is a
vendor that has the attention of the regional Bells and cable
service providers. The possibilities that surround Inferno's
potential to quickly penetrate a broad market are staggering.
Inferno may be compelling at the corporate level, too: If you're
writing thin-client Web applications for your corporate intranet,
why not write to the same operating system that your telephones are
using and get extra capabilities for free?  LAN

NETWORKS: CABLE TESTERS IN THE FIELD

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Field testing a cable plant serves to verify its transmission
performance. This results in a more professional hand-off from your
cabling contractor. The guidelines presented in this series is a
high level summary of the results of our evaluation and experience
using the cable test instruments. These guidelines are not meant to
duplicate the information in TIA/EIA TSB67, or the contents of
individual field tester manuals, but to provide additional
information to address issues relevant to the testing of structured
cabling installations.

These guidelines should be considered generic to all testers and as
a general rule it is important to upgrade to the latest firmware
and maintain the current documentation (including readme files) of
the testers to ensure up-to-date operational procedures.

Calibration of Field Testers and Test Configurations

Different field test instruments have slightly different
calibration procedures. It is important that these procedures are
followed. Proper calibration of the field testers is required to
ensure accurate measurements.

Calibration of Remote Injector

A short length of tester equipment cord (supplied with the field
tester) is used to connect the main unit to the remote unit and the
calibration sequence activated from the main unit. This will result
in the main unit determining attenuation loss inherent in the
testers and calibrate this loss to be 0 dB (see Figure 1).
Different manufacturers provide different calibration kits. If
adapters are needed for the measurement of the installed cabling,
it is a good idea to include these adapters in the calibration.
This is because adapters are not part of the installed cable plant
and should consequently be calibrated out of the attenuation
measurement, resulting in better measurement accuracy for
attenuation.

Selection of Cable Type

Selecting the cable type closest to the cable being tested will
yield better accuracy, especially for length and propagation delay
measurements. Often, the field tester is pre-loaded with various
cable types, including 1061/2061 cables. The main result of
selecting a cable type is the selection of the nominal velocity of
propagation (NVP). Values for NVP are obtained by tester vendors
from cable data sheets, or sometimes verbally from individuals
representing cable vendors. Consequently, these NVP values are
often incorrect or out of date. It is critical that the correct
cable type be selected and the NVP determined using the field
tester calibration procedure.

Selection of Test Configuration

TSB67 defines two test configurations, a basic link and a channel
(see Figures 2 and 3). A channel assumes two connections at each
end while a basic link assumes one connection at each end.

For example, if you are testing the cabling installed by a
contractor from the wall outlet to the termination in the
telecommunications closet, you need to configure the field tester
for a basic link. If on the other hand, you are diagnosing an end-
to end cabling circuit that will be attached to equipment at both
ends, including cross-connections, patch cords, and equipment
cords, you need to configure the field tester to measure a channel.
Sometimes, you may have a situation where there are two connections
at one end and a single connection at the other end. For routine
autotest measurements, it is acceptable to measure this
configuration as a channel in the interest of efficiency. However,
for diagnostic or single parameter tests, this configuration will
need to be tested as a channel and a basic link. The end that has
two connections must pass channel NEXT requirements, while the end
with one connection must pass basic link NEXT requirements. This
type of dual configuration testing may be necessary only if you are
working in a detailed analysis or diagnostic mode.

Calibration of NVP

TSB67 outlines a simple calibration procedure for NVP using a known
length of cable. Since various testers use different internal
procedures to find the pair with the shortest electrical delay
(corresponds to maximum velocity of propagation), calibration is
the only sure way of initialising the field tester with the right
NVP for the particular cable type you are testing. This will result
in more accurate length measurements and less variability of length
between different pairs within a 4-pair cable. Figure 4 illustrates
the NVP calibration setup.

To calibrate, reel off 25 metres (82 feet) of cable and attach
modular jacks to both ends. Note the exact jacket foot marks and
determine and length of cable that is cut from the reel. Attach
this connectorised cable to the main unit and the remote unit using
tester. Select NVP calibration from the menus and enter the length
of the cable. Note that since the length is determined from the
foot marks on the jacket, it is necessary to make sure that the
field tester is set to the appropriate units (metric or US
Customary units) before running the calibration command from the
main unit. The main unit will display the NVP determined for the
1061/2061 cable that you are calibrating.

Save this NP as a default for the appropriate cable type, so that
you do not have to re-calibrate NVP again for the same type of
cable. If you move on to another installation, you may have a
different cable, which requires that you calibrate NVP again.

Field Measurement Procedures

It is important to develop uniform test practices and provide
adequate training. Although each installation may have different
requirements, it is risky letting each job get tested differently.
These units are much more complicated than continuity buzzers, and
improper settings or inadequate battery management could waste
hours worth of testing. Suitable calibration procedures and
intervals must be enforced. For example, calibration of the remote
unit every day of use is a good practice. Calibration of NVP for
each job will ensure that the NVP represents the value of the cable
being installed at a site.

Sanity Checks

Any tester should undergo regular checkups, or some form of sanity
check. Users should develop some expertise to assess whether a
tester is providing useful results. One simple method is to
construct a sample link to be used as a reference. Make sure that
is physically protected and not subject to movement. Expect some
variation with temperature, humidity, and time, but this is a valid
check for malfunctioning units. A link such as this is required for
Nominal Velocity of Propagation (NVP) calibration may be used as a
reference link and will serve as a simple test to verify the
consistency of a field tester. If this same link is used to check
periodically for tester repeatability, one will get a useful
indication that the field tester is functioning properly (see
Figure 4).

IS 11801 and TIA TSB67 Testing Issues

With the release of TIA-568-A, TIA TSB67 and IS 11801, customers
are faced with confusing choices in specifying testing requirements
and interpreting test results. Most of the confusion arises from
attempting to test against the performance limits of IS 11801. It
should be noted that several of the performance limits listed in IS
11801 are marked "ffs" ("for future study").

Some of the reasons behind the "ffs" entries include lack of
agreement from cable vendors, inconsistent results from field
testing trials, and lack of accuracy determination methods for
hand-held testing equipment in relation to such parameters. In
addition, while specifying performance limits in IS 11801, the
international standards community is still to release detailed test
procedures and test configurations.

The horizontal link from which the IS 11801 performance includes
two connections in the floor Distributor (Horizontal Cross-connect
in TIA-568-A), a 5 metre patch cord, 90 metres of cable and a
connection at the work area. This link specifically excludes the
equipment cable and work area cable. It is not clear whether hand-
held instruments, compliant to TIA TSB-67 are capable of accurately
testing this link, as this would require the test set to "exclude"
the equipment and work area cables.

One of the parameters marked "ffs" in IS 11801 is Return Loss (RL).
While the method for accurately measuring RL in the field is yet to
be specified, additional difficulties can be encountered when using
test leads or patch cords incorrectly matched to the cabling
system, or degraded by repeated use. At least one of the TSB67
compliant test sets in the market includes two choices for IS 11801
configurations (with and without RL), and the test set manufacturer
advises the users to use the "IS 11801 without RL" option. The
difficulties experienced by some users when testing RL with
incorrectly matched test leads highlights the advantages of a
cabling system designed with matched components.

In contrast with IS 11801, the TIA 568-A Standard and TSB-67
include practical test configurations (Figures 2 & 3) and accuracy
specifications for hand-held instruments. While work is underway to
harmonise the differences, and to reach practical agreement on the
IS 11801 specifications marked "ffs", the practical choice is to
refer to TIA TSB-67 for accurate field testing.

Use of Interface Adapters

Sometimes, an interface adapter is necessary to attach field
testers to the channel/link under test. These adapters are an extra
element in the link configuration and may affect the accuracy of a
measurement. In general, unknown adapters should be avoided. To
measure a basic link with a 110 interface, an adapter cord with 110
on one end and the interface of the tester on the other end is
preferred. Test instrument vendors should provide this adapter
cord. For channel measurements, testers provide an adapter from the
tester interface connector to a modular jack. Again, it is
important that only cords and adapters provided by the testers be
used to attach field testers to the link under test. Note that TSB-
67 requires that field tester cords do not exceed 2 metres.

Durability of Connecting Hardware Interfaces

An important issue not yet handled by any of the testers is keeping
track of the life cycle of test interfaces. Any jack or plug has a
reliable limit on connect/ disconnect cycles. Interfaces should be
serialised (marked) and users should keep track of how many tests
are performed so their reliable limit is not exceeded. Additional
interfaces should be ordered and available for replacement at
suitable intervals. Field testers currently do not have a mechanism
for storing the number of times an instrument has been used. Hence
it is a good practice to maintain approximate (to the nearest 100)
cycles of usage so that plug/jack contacts can be inspected and
replaced as necessary. Different testers claim different number of
usage cycles for accurate measurements. As a first step these
vendor guidelines may be sufficient. If measurements are not
repeatable or if the failure rate of links increases, it may be
time to replace the plug/jack interfaces.

Backup Procedures

Backup protection is another important issue. A simple strategy
could be to print tests every few hours. This might be suitable for
some small jobs, but may be too time consuming for most. A better
strategy is to uplink to a PC every 4 hours and make duplicates on
floppy disks. Also, make sure an extra set of charged batteries are
ready.

Structural Return Loss and Return Loss Measurements

Structural Return Loss (SRL) characterising "impedance roughness"
of a cable is a cable parameter and is measured in a laboratory
environment in accordance with ASTM D 4566 Method 3, or equivalent.
SRL is not specified as a field measurement for links and chan-nels
either in TIA/EIA-568-A or in IS 11801 standards. Hence any claims
to measuring SRL in the field should be considered non-standard and
questionable.

Return loss is a measure of reflected signal and is used to
characterise either individual components or links. When
characterising links, return loss is an indication of impedance
mismatches of different components within links and is not
specified in either TIA/EIA 568-A, or the associated TIA/EIA TSB-67
field testing document. Further TIA/EIA TSB-67 clearly states that
return loss is under study. The IS 11801 document has a slightly
different approach when dealing with items under study. It shows
the possible target values for future revision of the IS 11801
document and qualifies these values as "FFS" (For Future Study).
The reason these are marked FFS is because no industry agreement
has been reached on the possible values, test methods, and
measurement instruments.

Despite the above background, certain field test manufacturers may
implement proprietary test schemes for measuring return loss to
differentiate their instruments in the market. These proprietary
test schemes have not been reviewed and accepted by industry and
must therefore be viewed with caution.

Differences in Length Measurements

Different pairs within a 4-pair cable use different twist rates to
improve NEXT performance. This introduces a physical difference in
length between different pairs. Additionally, the velocity of
propagation may vary between pairs because of material differences.
Such differences are normal, and within the operating limits of
cabling and applications standards. Furthermore, these differences
are not significantly affected by installation of cabling, and
should therefore not be a major source of concern when checking the
quality of the installation.

Delay skew is the term commonly used to refer to the difference in
propagation delay over different pairs. The worst case delay skew
allowed in application standards is 50 ns for a 100 different
pairs. The worst case delay skew allowed in application standards
is 50 ns for a 100 metre channel. Given that the speed of light in
open space is 1 ft/ns and assuming a relative velocity of 0.6 c for
copper cabling, the maximum difference in electrical length allowed
is 30 feet (50 ns x 0.6) for a 100 metre channel. Differences of up
to 20 feet in the length measurements of pairs for a typical cable
run are not uncommon and fall within the requirements of
application standards.

Calibration of NVP for each different type of cable is critical to
reduce errors in length measurements. Different cables require re-
calibration. Note that the NVP calibration results must be saved to
ensure the new NVP values are effective. To test if the calibration
was saved, power down the tester, power up and check if the new NVP
values for the cable type being installed are current in memory.
(Note: Because of accuracy issues, TIA standards do not endorse
measurement of propagation delay and delay skew using field
testers).

25-Pair Cabling

TIA considers 25-pair cabling to be backbone cabling and requires
NEXT to conform to "power-sum" requirements. These computations
involve hundreds of pair combinations and several thousand data
points for conformance testing. Power sum NEXT testing is not
possible with currently available field testers. The alternative is
to check individual 4 pair units within a 25-pair cable and verify
each unit meets the 4-pair horizontal cabling requirements. For
example, to test a zone cabling installation with a 25-pair cable
serving six work areas, the six individual circuits can be verified
as basic links or channels, depending on the current test
configuration. Note: 25-pair cable is different cable from 4-pair
cable, and its velocity of calibration must be calibrated and
stored in the field tester. Any 4-pair unit from the 25-pair cable
may be used for calibration.  LAN

NETWORKS: THE COMMON GATEWAY INTERFACE IS THE KEY TO INTERACTIVE WEB SITES

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

This series of tutorials, which has been running since July, has
examined services commonly available on the Internet and has
explored what you, as a network manager, need to do to make such
services available within your company (via your corporate
intranet) and to others (via the Internet).

Last month, we focused on HTML and took a first look at hypertext
links. This month, we'll continue to explore HTML, and we'll take a
look at the common gateway interface (CGI).

Using simple tags, you can make any word or phrase a hyperlink.
Hyperlinks are not limited to text, however. They can also be
images. The following code fragment shows how to make an image into
a hyperlink: <A

HREF="http://www.amphibian.com/frog.htm"><IMGSRC="frog.gif"></A>

This sample code displays the graphic image frog.gif, and-if the
user clicks on that image-causes the Web browser to request the Web
page frog.htm from the Web server www.amphibian.com.

THE COMMON GATEWAY INTERFACE

HTML, along with HTTP, is the enabling technology of the World Wide
Web. HTML's most compelling feature is hypertext linking. When you
look for information in a conventional book you might search the
index for a key word, then flip through the book to find the
referenced page, and hope to find the information you seek. By
contrast, when searching for information on the Web, simply
clicking on a hyperlink and immediately jumping to the referenced
page is gratifyingly quick and easy. HTML is, however, essentially
a read-only format. It's not interactive except when using the
mouse to navigate. HTML pages are static documents that don't
change until someone (the Webmaster, in many cases) accesses the
Web server and edits them.

From the start, Web developers have been looking for ways to make
Web servers interactive to allow users to input information as well
as retrieve information. The standard way of delivering information
in this manner is now known as the common gateway interface. Using
CGI, the Web server, in response to a user request for information,
runs a program to search for that information and returns the
results to the user. In order to achieve these results, the Web
server typically generates an HTML page by inserting a few HTML
statements into a pre-existing page. A Web server using CGI in this
manner could potentially run an infinite variety of programs.

If you've used a Web search engine to find an item of interest,
you've used CGI. But CGI itself isn't the search engine. Rather,
it's a way to interface programs, such as search engines, with Web
servers.

HTTP (Web) servers are designed primarily to serve up HTML
documents. CGI files, however, aren't documents, they're programs.
Therefore, to store CGI programs, most Web servers use a special
directory, commonly named cgi-bin. The Web server knows that files
stored in the cgi-bin directory are to be executed rather than
simply sent to the user's Web browser for display. CGI programs can
be written in a wide variety of languages, including DOS batch
files, BASIC, C, and scripting languages such as Perl. It's the job
of the CGI to activate the CGI program at the proper time and pass
the program to any necessary user- or operating environment-
generated data. The CGI program then processes whatever data is
generated. Once the program accomplishes this process (which should
take only seconds-the goal here is interactivity), it must return
some output to the user via the user's Web browser. To make the
output appropriate for browser display, the CGI program must format
its output in the form of an HTML document.

A FORM FOR EVERYTHING

A CGI program has to somehow get from the user any data to be
processed. That's where HTML forms come into play. HTML forms are
similar to paper forms: They provide specific spaces in which to
enter specific data items. A simple form is shown in Figure 1. This
sample form has one text input field: product name. The form also
has some multiple-choice fields, in which, for example, the user
can check off the type of product, as well as what networking
protocols the product supports. The form also has a button the user
can click on to submit the entry. (A CGI program will only act upon
the information in a form when the form data has been submitted to
the CGI program.) Clicking on the form's Clear Form button resets
the form back to its default values. The HTML code for this form is
shown in Listing 1 (page 33). Note that to aid in discussion,
Listing 1 includes line numbers, which you wouldn't use in actual
HTML code.

The source code for a form is bound by the <form action="url"> and
</form> tags (see line 1 and line 14 of Listing 1). The use of
action specifies the action to be taken when the form is submitted.
In other words, action determines which CGI program should be run
in order to process the form, and you specify either a full or
partial URL for that program. Depending on the Web server, you may
be able to set a default directory for all CGI programs. As long as
the program you want to run is stored in that directory you need
only specify the program's file name. Otherwise, you will probably
have to provide a complete URL for the file.

Use method to move input data from the form into the CGI program
that's going to process that data. We'll explore the methods by
which this is done in more detail next month, but for now, just be
aware that there are two general methods you can use: "get" and
"post". If you're going to use the "get" method to transfer data
from the form to the CGI program specified in the action URL, be
sure that the CGI program is written to accept data in this manner.
By the same token, if you use "post" to send data from your form,
be sure the CGI program is expecting "post" data input.

Line 2 and line 3 of Listing 1 prompt the user to enter data. After
the prompts comes the code that puts a text field into the form
(line 4). Entering input type="text" tells the Web browser that it
is a text field. Specifying name="name" tells the browser that the
name of this field is name. (This example asks for the name of a
product; if you want to

ask for the user's address, you might name this field address.)
size="25"

 indicates that the text box will be large enough to see 25
characters at a time. maxlength="30" means that the field can hold
up to 30 characters of text.

In this case, the length of the field exceeds the length of the
box, so a scroll bar will appear if the user types a long text
string.

Next on the form are radio buttons, followed by check boxes. These
are both multiple-choice, but they differ slightly in how they work
in that, using check boxes, you can check more than one box at a
time, but you can select only one radio button. Clicking on a radio
button clears the radio button that was previously selected. By
comparison, selecting one check box does not deselect another.

Let's discuss radio buttons first. You determine the button style
by setting the type for the input equal to radio. There are three
statements for radio buttons (line 6 through line 8)-one for each
of the possible selections. Each statement contains
name="prodtype." This creates a logical field named prodtype. If
the first button is checked, the field prodtype takes on the value
bridge. (You can determine the value by using the statement
"value='bridge'"). Note also the keyword checked in line 6. When
the form first appears, the radio button for bridge will be
checked; in other words, we've made this setting the default. The
user can override this default setting by clicking on the Router or
Switch button.

Next comes a series of three check boxes that allow the user to
indicate which network protocols the product supports (represented
by lines 9 through 11of the sample code in Listing 1). When a user
clicks in a box, "X" appears in that box to indicate that it is
checked. Clicking again on a checked check box removes the "X," or
unchecks the box.

You create a check box field with the statement input type= "check
box ." You also need to specify the name of the input field. In
Listing 1, the name of the input field for the first check box is
set to IP. The sample code uses the keyword checked, indicating
that this box is selected by default, which the user can clear by
clicking on the check box.

When a check box is selected, by default the field with that name
has its value set to "on." Although it is not included in the
example, you can optionally use the value attribute to set the
value, for example, to "green" when the box is selected. When the
check box is not selected, the field has no value. In this example,
the default setting for all three boxes is checked. Thus, unless
the user clears the boxes, the form returns ip=on, ipx=on, and
appletalk=on. If only the IP box is selected, the form returns only
ip=on. The IPX and AppleTalk boxes will be disregarded.

I don't have quite enough space here to finish the discussion of
our sample form, so we'll have to conclude that next month. Also,
so far, I've discussed gathering data to be passed to a CGI
program, but I haven't said much about how that data is transferred
or how the CGI program sends output back to the user. I'll cover
that (and more) in next month's Tutorial.  LAN

NETWORKS: Getting Basic Netware from Within Windows: A hidden menu
Automatic disk maintenance Securing automatic logins

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

A HIDDEN MENU

The following procedure will help you create a NetWare pop-up menu
that allows your users to perform some basic operations in a
NetWare environment from within Windows 3.1.

To enable the menu on a client, make sure the client's network
driver or secondary network driver for Windows is the NetWare
device driver (netware.drv). To do so, put either of the following
lines into the client's

system.ini file:

network.drv=netware.drv

secondnet.drv=netware.drv

Then, create a file in the root of the client's Windows directory
and name it netware.ini. In this file, type:

[Options]

netwarehotkey=1

The next time a user starts Windows, he can just press the <F6> key
and a small menu will pop up onscreen. The menu allows a user to
log in to and log out of a file server, map drives and printers,
and change the hot key.

Note: You must load the netx shell before you can use this feature.

Jafar H. Alhashemi

Network Administrator

Information Technology Department

Editor's note: The netware.drv driver Alhashemi refers to is found
in the older, 2.0x version of the NetWare device driver. The
NetWare pop-up menu is a built-in feature of that generation of
drivers only.

In the newer, 3.0x version of netware.drv, Novell includes a hot-
key feature that allows users to call up the NetWare User Tools
application from within Windows 3.1.

Users access the NetWare Users Tools window to quickly perform
network operations-such as map drives and printers, send messages,
display server resources, and so on-similar to those features found
with the afore-mentioned pop-up menu available with netware.drv
2.0x.

To enable the hot key for the NetWare Users Tools application, you
need to access the NetWare Settings window. You can do this by
clicking on the Network icon in the Control Panel.

The NetWare Settings window contains an option for enabling the hot
key, and an option to specify a hot key (the default is <F6>).

As with Alhashemi's instructions, you also need to specify the
NetWare device driver as the network driver. Unlike the 2.0x
driver, you don't have to create the netware.ini file, it is
created automatically when you enable the hot key feature using the
NetWare Settings window.

AUTOMATIC DISK MAINTENANCE

As a network administrator for a 160-workstation system, I used to
receive calls on a weekly basis from individuals having trouble
saving files on their computers. I have eliminated the bulk of
those calls by adding the following lines in the system login
script of our NetWare 4.1 servers:

if day_of_week = "wednesday" and os_version =

"v6.22" then begin

#c:\dos\scandisk c: /autofix /nosave /nosummary

end

When a user boots his or her computer and the system date reads
"Wednesday," the login script launches the DOS scandisk program.

Editor's note: Scandisk, which is available in DOS 6.x, analyses
computer drives for errors relating to the file allocation table,
file system structure, directory tree structure, and the physical
surface of the disk.

The /autofix switch automatically corrects any problems scandisk
encounters, thereby avoiding any user input. The /nosave switch
tells the program to delete any lost clusters it finds. The
/nosummary switch tells the program not to display its summary
screen after it finishes the scan.

To really clean things up, I add:

#c:\dos\defrag c: /f /s:n

Editor's note: The Defrag command reorganises information stored on
a disk to make the storage more efficient and to optimise the
performance of the disk. The /f switch tells the program to
defragment the files on the drive indicated-in this case the c:
drive. The /s:n switch organises files alphabetically, by name.

The two DOS commands scandisk and defrag, with their parameters,
run without user intervention. Users know that their computers will
take a little longer to boot on Wednesdays.

Securing Automatic Logins

The July 1996 Patches and Fixes column correctly points out that
configuring a workstation to log in automatically presents a
security risk, especially if the password is contained in a text
file.

I've set up a process based on NetWare's Station Restriction
feature. My unattended stations that perform unique functions do
not have passwords, but they are restricted to one login at a
specific node address.

I've taken steps to prevent exiting to DOS by removing the comspec
environment variable from the autoexec.bat. Also, I force the
machines to log out of the network once they exit the application.

For me, this approach works because 99 per cent of my users use
their PC as a "terminal," and all applications are run off the
network.

To prevent shelling to DOS from within a DOS application, I use the
following lines in a batch file:

set oldcomspec=%comspec%

set comspec=

<load application here>

set comspec=%oldcomspec%

If a user tries to shell to DOS from an app, he receives an error
message, as the comspec variable is invalid. Some DOS applications
won't run correctly without the comspec variable, but I've found
that Lotus 1-2-3, DrawPerfect, Reflex, Symphony, and WordPerfect
work fine.

Under Windows, I prevent users from accessing DOS by not providing
them with a DOS icon and by removing the Run command from the File
menu (I use Saber Menu System).

To force machines to automatically log out after exiting an
application, I add the following lines to the end of the batch file
that runs the application. In fact, I use these lines at the end of
the batch files that run our DOS and Windows menus so that users
know what to do at the f:\login prompt. Here are the lines:

<commands that start

application>

rem Change default drive to login; clear screen

z:cd cal1\sys:login

cls

rem Blank out the DOS prompt

set prompt=

rem Display the LOGOUT message

type v:logout.txt

rem Run OUT.BAT located in SYS:LOGIN

out

The contents of logout.txt state that the logout is complete, and
to please turn the system off or press any key to restart. Here's
out.bat:

@echo off

logout > nul :

pause > nul :

warmboot

warmboot.com is a utility that restarts the machine. I forgot where
I got that particular utility, but there are several utilities
available that perform the same function.

With this setup, users see a confirming message to either reboot or
turn off the system. If the user presses any key, except <Ctrl-C>,
the PC will reboot. If the user gets smart and presses <Ctrl-C>,
the batch file will terminate. But, because there is no DOS prompt,
that user will probably just reboot anyway. (However, informed
users could type set prompt=$p$g and find themselves at z:\login.)

You can secure the remote device mentioned in "Following the
Password Piper" by restricting the login name to the node address
of that remote device. With NetWare 2.x or 3.x, this naming is done
through Syscon. In NetWare 4.x, it is an NDS property.

By using this restriction, a network login which uses the device's
node address as the login name has to be performed at the device to
which the address is tied. A password is not necessary, but could
be used for additional security.

Editor's note: The preceding letters refer to "Following the
Password Piper," which ran in Patches and Fixes in the July 1996
issue (page 28). The submission discusses one network manager's
desire for a fix that enables a workstation to automatically log on
to the network (composed, in this case, of NetWare servers) when
switched on. This process would simplify the resetting of devices,
such as e-mail servers, located at remote branch offices.

In the event that such a machine were to hang due to a software
problem, a nontechnical user could restore that machine online by
simply turning the power off and then back on.

"Following the Password Piper" also discusses ways in which such an
automatic logon could be accomplished. These solutions involve
putting the account and password in a file on the station's local
disk drive.

We point out the security exposure this involves and recommend that
the person who does the power switching also type in the password,
as opposed to keeping the password on disk.

NetWare does allow you to restrict a particular account's login to
a specific node address. While that feature can be handy and will
deter some potential attackers, it isn't going to prevent
sophisticated attacks. On some networks, such as Arcnet, the node
address is set by the installer and, therefore, can be set to any
address. On Ethernet networks, the manufacturer embeds the node
address in firmware. Note that while Ethernet NICs default to using
the address in firmware, many NICs have options that allow an
alternate address to be used, which makes it possible for one node
to impersonate another node.

Our concern about placing the password on a workstation's local
disk drive is that the network becomes vulnerable to any intruder
with physical access to that workstation. Restricting login to a
specific node address is equally vulnerable. An intruder can gain
access to a file server by simply switching on that workstation.

We included these suggestions because we feel they are good ones
for network managers to have in their bag of security tricks. They
can be a good way to augment security, but we caution you against
relying on them as foolproof solutions.

Sheldon mentions another NetWare feature-the ability to restrict
simultaneous logins. By default, users can have multiple,
simultaneous sessions. You can, however, limit an account to a
single login. This approach can be useful, particularly for e-mail
servers or other such machines on the network. If such a node is
logged in, no one else is able to log in with that account name.

This approach, too, is vulnerable to someone who has physical
access to that machine. Also, if the workstation is not logged in
at all times, there will be periods of vulnerability.  LAN

NETWORKS: Who's Afraid of TCP/IP?

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Need to understand TCP/IP and how to buy a good stack? TCP/IP is
now enjoying its day in the sun with the explosion of the Internet
and the emergence of the corporate Intranet.

Computer systems in use now are diverse. From a mainframe running
an operating system like VM or MVS, down to a PC that could be
running Windows, DOS, NT or OS2. In between are minicomputers that
could be running anything like Solaris, IBM AIX or HP-UX). You have
proprietary local area, generic operating system, mainframes
running something, minis running something else, and when you want
to network all these, one of the best technologies to use is
TCP/IP. After all, if TCP/IP is what you use on the outside, why
shouldn't you use it on the inside?

Crucial Add-ons

Key to TCP/IP technology are the add-ons such as security,
collaboration, mobility, interoperability, and ease of use.

Security involves encrypting data going between PCs and the company
firewall, for example, developing interoperability with firewalls
so you can create what is called a private network between your PC
and the firewall. Companies are focusing on enabling security into
the technology itself (IPSEC, Cylink, RSA, etc.) and also on
interoperability of security-working on establishing the standards,
and ensuring interoperability as a whole.

Collaboration software using TCP/IP as the underlying transport can
take the form of e-mail, discussion databases, video-conferencing,
etc. Companies are implementing collaboration protocols for the
next generation of audio, video and workgroup collaboration needs
using RSVP (reservation protocol), multicasting, IPv6, RTCP (Real-
Time Protocol Control Transport), or RTP (Real-Time Protocol
Transport).

With 50 per cent of all PCs sold today being laptops, the ability
for users to go mobile and still be connected to the office network
is essential. Many companies are working with technologies like
mobile IP, using one static IP address to communicate at all times
with a corporate Intranet without having to change your IP
addresses when you change you location on the corporate network.

What Features?

If you are looking for a comprehensive TCP/IP package, check if it
offers the following features:

  The ability to detect a router on the network should you not have
access to the systems administrators when you need them.

  The 7a package that supports not only TCP/IP but co-exists well
with related technologies like NetBIOS, IPX, Banyan, DEC, IBM etc.

  Address and name resolution which offers convenient features like
DHCP to manage your addresses in a simplified manner, WinSNMP
support for interoperability with third party network managers like
HP OpenView and MIB11 compliance. And you should look for a package
that supports VXD technology so you can optimise memory management
capabilities of Win95.

  Simultaneous connection from the desktop so that if you run your
software on a LAN and want to switch to a WAN, you can have both
resident in memory at the same time. Uses: serial send situations
(bank and retail), LAN and Cable situations (interactive cable),
redundancy (financial), LAN/serial connections.

  Mobile IP-so users can connect to a corporate Intranet without
changing their IP address;

  Multicast facility, which allows you to send to a group of hosts
rather than to all hosts (broadcast). The ability to multicast is
crucial to videoconferencing when you wish to link with a select
group rather than with everyone on the net.

  Compatibility with ISDN technologies like WinISDN, CAPI; support
for Sun's Yellow Pages NIS (network information service);
compatibility with firewall standards like SOCKS; compatibility
with new Novell technologies like Netware/IP, etc.

  Compliance with other related technologies like TDI (Transport
Driver Interface)-a new standard Microsoft is promoting that
resides between the Kernel protocols and apps services.

Who Provides?

Choose a company that is looking at new technologies such as RSVP
,RTCP, and RTP. RSVP reserves bandwidth for use with video and
audio, collaboration, workgroup applications, e-mail, Intranet
traffic, etc. Transport protocols are for real-time applications
such as point-of-sale.

Look for a company that follows all the issues being discussed on
the IETF (Internet Engineer Task Force) work group such as
security, mobile IP and IPv6. One of the biggest problems facing
the Internet and IPv4 is the lack of address space. IPv6 will offer
expanded addressing from 32-bit to 128-bit with hierarchical
scalability.

This will be essential for enterprise, Internet, intranet, PDAs,
cellular, cable TV, and smart appliances.

Your partner should have a well defined strategy for dealing with
issues like next generation IP addressing-how will they make the
transition from current addressing to the new one?

How will they deal with it? Gradual transition is possible, based
on a dual stack strategy, with hosts and routers upgraded
independently and no single 'doomsday,' which may be more
convenient for a lot of companies.

In my view, considering the developments, TCP/IP has become the
standard and is the foundation to the future of connectivity and
communications.

NETWORKS: Optimising a print server for NetWare

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

QHow does a network print server act in a Novell NetWare network?

AS You can choose Print Server Mode or Remote Printer Mode. In
Print Server Mode the print server emulates a workstation or file
server running the PSERVER software. This mode provides high
performance but requires one NetWare license for each print server.
In Remote Printer Mode the print server emulates a workstation
running the RPRINTER or NPRINTER software. Performance is lower
than PSERVER but extra licenses are not needed.

QHow does a print server act in a Unix environment?

AA network print server can either act as an independent node or it
can be integrated in the network spool system. In both cases it has
its own IP address, which is set as usual with the ARP or BOOTP
commands. Print jobs can either be transferred directly to the
print server by using FTP or telnet, or sent to a print queue with
the lpr command.

QDoes a network print server need a large cache memory to spool
print jobs?

ANo, a print server does not work as a spooling device. It passes
the data directly to the printer. If the printer is busy, the
network operating system takes care of the situation and the print
jobs are spooled on different locations depending on which print
method is being used. When printing via the file server, print jobs
are always spooled in a print queue. When printing peer-to-peer,
the print job is spooled locally on the PC's hard disk.

NETWORKS: Which Internet Server?

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

QI am sourcing for a suitable Intel-based Web server which would be
used in our company's intranet. I your view, how does Microsoft's
Internet Information Server compare with the other web server
offerings in the market?

AExcluding the various freeware and shareware web servers around,
there are basically four products that currently dominate the web
server market. These are: Microsoft's IIS, Netscape Communications
Server (NT Version and BSDI Unix Version) and Novell's Netware Web
Server. In terms of functionality, all the web servers support HTML
and standard CGIs (with the exception of Netware Web Server).
Netware does, however, support a proprietary extension called
Remote CGI (R-CGI). This allows the execution of CGI applications
on a separate machine from the Web server. It is different from
most CGI implementations which execute CGI applications in a
separate process on the same machine as the Web server.

In terms of API support, IIS and Netscape's Communications Server
(NT Version) both support ISAPI, NSAPI and proprietary APIs.
Netware does not support either ISAPI, NSAPI or a Novell defined
set of API to extend their web server (other than R-CGI).

According to tests conducted by Shiloh Consulting and Haynes &
Company, the Microsoft Internet Information Server substantially
outperformed the other Web servers tested on straight HTML and
proprietary APIs. This performance advantage increased consistently
as the number of clients making requests increased. The second best
performer in HTML tests was NetWare, followed by the Netscape BSDI
server and the Netscape NT server.

When running CGI, the best performer was the Netscape BSDI server,
followed by the Microsoft IIS. As should be expected, server
performance for two servers running on Windows NT (IIS and
Netscape) was virtually equal when 100 per cent of the requests
were for standard CGI. In this case, both servers spent a majority
of the time running identical CGI code, so very little time is
actually spent in the HTTP server code. Microsoft's API (ISAPI) is
roughly five times as fast as Microsoft's CGI. Netscape's API
(NSAPI) is roughly about twice as fast as Netscape's CGI. In tests
of the two servers with proprietary APIs, IIS was two or three
times faster than Netscape.

Even when the Internet Information Server was handling many more
HTML or API requests than the other servers, the average response
time for IIS to handle each request was significantly less. It was
approximately a quarter that of Netscape for straight HTML and one
third as great for 100 per cent API requests. When 100 per cent of
requests were for CGI, the Netscape BSDI server was substantially
faster than the Windows NT-based servers.

The superior performance of the Microsoft Internet Information
Server, which incidentally comes packaged with Microsoft NT Server
4.0 (and downloadable from Microsoft for NT 3.51), means that Web
site managers running HTML or API's on Intel platforms will find
Microsoft's server the best alternative for minimising hardware
costs, allowing a comfortable margin for peak loads, and providing
the maximum room for growth.

All tests were conducted on a HP NetServer 5/133 Model LS with 32
MB of RAM. The Netscape BSDI version tests were done on the same
machine but with 128 MB RAM. Novell tests were run with NetWare
4.1. IIS and Netscape Communications Server (NT Version) were run
on top of Windows NT Server 3.51, and the BSDI version was run on
BSDI Unix Version 2.01. A 100 Mbps network was used for the tests.
More information on the performance comparisons can be found on the
Internet at http://www.microsoft.

NETWORKS: ISDN to the Internet

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

QI administer 22 users on a NetWare 3.12 network. I would like to
connect to the Internet, and I want to use ISDN. How do I set up
the ISDN connections? What software and hardware do I need? What
about security? Can I run IPX NETX at the workstation, or do I need
to run IPXODI and a VLM? Is there a better way to connect to the
Internet besides ISDN?

ATo provide Internet access, you should consider installing a
router-more specifically, an "access" router that supports ISDN-on
your network. Vendors preconfigure access routers to provide dial-
up asynchronous/synchronous services for LAN and remote users.
Cisco Systems, Bay Networks, and Ascend Communications all provide
router solutions. Make sure the router supports ISDN and that it
has enough ISDN ports to support your particular environment.

When you receive your router, configure it for IPX according to
vendor specifications. Without the IPX configuration, the server
and the router will not recognise each other.

If users need only infrequent access to the Internet or if you want
to minimise performance degradation when the LAN accesses the WAN,
you can implement a dial-on-demand ISDN architecture. With dial-on-
demand, traffic within the LAN is identified as special or
interesting. In this case, "interesting" means the traffic within
the network that causes the router to perform call setup functions.
A standard configuration might allow IPX to start the call setup-as
long as the IPX packets are not carrying RIP/SAP updates. You
should be able to configure all these parameters on the router. For
example, you can configure a Cisco router to identify IPX traffic
but filter and block the propagation of RIP/SAP updates.

Your servers and workstations on your current LAN require no
additional software. The connection between the router and server
is either direct or via a hub. The workstations' configurations,
assuming each has an IPX protocol stack, remain the same. Only
workstations requiring Internet services need Internet software.

Because you're running NetWare 3.12, workstation ODI and VLM
support should already be present. The workstation configuration
requires you to add an IP protocol stack to support ftp, Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), or telnet (Virtual Terminal)
connections to the Internet. Remember that the Internet is a large
TCP/IP network and that its services are accessed using TCP/IP.
Novell's LAN WorkPlace for DOS or LAN WorkGroup software provides a
suitable IP stack for Internet access.

Security is handled at the router via filters and at the server via
NetWare security. Unless your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
suggests changes to your security configuration, you should be set.
Additional security might involve adding a firewall machine to
protect your network from outside intruders. CheckPoint Software's
Firewall 1 is a popular protection solution.

Hardware isn't all you need to access the Internet; you must also
choose an ISP. Some ISPs provide Internet addressing and a complete
suite of Internet connection options. Some might even suggest a
router solution for your environment.

WHERE'S THE CACHE?

QI've been told that the key to NetWare optimisation is to add more
memory. But before adding more RAM, I need to know how to calculate
the ideal amount of cache to support basic server operations.

AYou're right. Cache sizing is often the most beneficial
optimisation process you can perform on NetWare servers. The trick
is determining the right amount of cache for a particular server.

Unfortunately, the server memory calculations included in the
NetWare 3 and 4 documentation are outdated and, in some cases,
produce incorrect requirements. To avert this possible disaster,
take a look at two procedures that Novell has published.

The first procedure is a memory calculation worksheet that
estimates RAM requirements for new servers. The worksheet
incorporates factors, such as the server's volume parameters, NOS
features, and number of users, to produce the total memory
requirement for the server. If you're building a server with third-
party NLMs and additional name spaces, an option lets you add more
RAM requirements for these services. When you're finished with the
worksheet, you simply round the resulting estimate up to the
server's nearest memory configuration and install that much RAM in
the server. You can find the worksheet in "Calculating Memory
Requirements for NetWare 3 and 4," in the Novell Application Notes,
January 1995. An automated version of the worksheet, called
SMEM.EXE, is available in the NOVUSER forum of NetWire on
Compuserve.

The second procedure is a cache-tuning procedure for existing
NetWare 4 servers. Every server supports a different set of users
and applications; the workload they produce can significantly
affect the server's cache. In some cases, the estimate you derive
using the preceding worksheet can be several megabytes off. This
tuning procedure allows you to monitor the NetWare 4 least-
recently-used (LRU) Sitting Time Statistic in MONITOR.NLM and tune
the server's cache for its specific production environment. This
procedure is documented in "Tuning Cache with the NetWare 4 LRU
Sitting Time Statistic," in the Novell Application Notes, March
1995.

These procedures can also be found on the Web (http://www.
novell.com) and in Novell's Network Support Encyclopedia (NSE Pro)
on CD-ROM. To subscribe to the Application Notes or NSE Pro CD,

NETWORKS: Tools of the Trade

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

To ensure its technical support employees are well-versed in both
product knowledge and customer relations, WRQ requires all
potential technicians to participate in a three- to six-month
program called the Hatchery. This informal training program allows
"hatchlings" to learn about fielding support calls and the WRQ
corporate culture, which promotes treating people as assets and
giving employees freedom to do their jobs unencumbered, all without
a set schedule of courses.

LAN Mag: How many support technicians work for WRQ?

Walker: A hundred in Seattle, and we also have technical support
people in our European headquarters in Holland and in our
Southeast-Asia office in Singapore. In fact, because our sales are
through distributors, the main reason for our international offices
is for support.

LAN Mag: Do you feel that other organisations don't put that same
career-oriented spin on tech support?

Walker: I don't know specifically about other organisations, but
generally most people perceive technical support as being a burnout
job. A person normally would not think of making a career out of
technical support if they could avoid it. But that's not true here.

While the company has very low turnover in general, I think
technical support is actually our lowest turnover department.

LAN Mag: What types of resources and tools do your technicians have
at their disposal to help them look into some of the complex issues
that arise with connectivity software?

Walker: Well, a lot of people are not sure which parameters to aim
for when they're building in support because there are all these
different situations. There are simple questions, and, at the other
extreme, there are very complex questions. What we try to do is
take the attitude that first off, the customer support person is
supposed to have ownership of the problem. In other words, we don't
use really a multitier, escalation system. But if we have senior
professionals as tech support engineers, then once a problem is
assigned to them, they are there to own the problem.

In essence, they have the discretion to pursue the problem to the
end of the earth, if need be. That might be a sort of extreme case,
but in order to solve a problem that is very tough, you may have to
go back to the programmers of the product.

LAN Mag: Besides being highly trained, do the technicians have
copies of the products at their disposal or a simulated environment
set up at your offices?

Walker: They have a very generous allotment of hardware, and they
have access to every level of software up through the source. But
more importantly, technical support is actually proportional to the
developmental organisation. And that's a little unusual.

LAN Mag: So technical support is under research and development?

Walker: Yes. The technicians have access to the people that develop
the product. The frustrating thing that I have experienced as a
consumer is that in some organisations, there is no path between
the people who are doing support and the development of the product
itself. But, if a problem extends into the base functionality of a
product, there's nothing you can do.

LAN Mag: In developing your model for fielding tech support
questions, did you look at the competition?

Walker: We certainly go to a lot of conferences and try to track
what other people are doing. We try to adopt any kind of ideas and
systems, but it is a homegrown system that's been developed by our
company in response to our customers' needs.  LAN

NETWORKS: Build Support to Build User Loyalty

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Fifteen years ago, when the PC market was still in its infancy, a
group of individuals in Seattle shelled out US$500 and started
Walker, Richer & Quinn (WRQ). The company founders, including
current president, Doug Walker, and vice-president of product
development, Craig McKibben, saw the potential of the PC and its
interaction with legacy systems.

LAN Mag: Has the growing complexity of the networking world led to
the need for more technical support or a different approach toward
it?

Walker: When the PC started becoming commercially available in the
early 1980s, people were rebels; they were more self-supporting,
which represented a revolt against the big glass room with
mainframes and centralised IT.

They were circumventing IT as an act of rebellion. IT wasn't part
of the decision and also wasn't responsible for supporting any of
the new products.

In more recent years, because of the growing complexity of
networking and communications, people are ceding control back to
IT. Buying decisions used to be driven by individuals, then by
departments, and now it's by IT. Instead of a departmental decision
about software, you're making a corporatewide and enterprisewide
decision about buying a piece of software. Often those buyers are
very concerned about support, and that's one of the first things
they want to talk about. They are very, very worried about the
support, so when you do these contract negotiations to make one of
these big sales, one of the first things out of their mouths is,
'Let's talk about support.'

LAN Mag: Does that apply more to host connectivity software, such
as your Reflection line of products, especially since customers are
buying thousands of licenses to connect PCs or workstations to
enterprise systems?

Walker: Yes. It's usually the first word out of their mouths,
whereas back in the Wild West days it was more of an after thought.

LAN Mag: Why has technical support traditionally been an
afterthought?

Walker: The early adopters of PC technology were more self-
sufficient, and they took it upon themselves to deal with any
problems that would arise.

But I think the complexity has grown. When we started the company
up I was a programmer, and one of the really and truly fun things
about a PC was that you could understand everything in the whole
machine. Now it's just too complicated.

LAN Mag: Are you trying to use your mainframe background as a
competitive advantage in promoting your technical support and
services to customers, and do you feel that technical support plays
a big role when companies make a purchasing decision?

Walker: It's definitely a key differentiator.

LAN Mag: For the most part, is Guide Services the support that
you've offered all along, only now it has a specific name?

Walker: Yes, it's putting a name to the services that we have been
offering, and it also marks an introduction of some new services.
One of the reasons for putting this name on it, too, is to heighten
our customers' awareness that these services exist.

What we wanted to do under the Guide Services umbrella was include
what we call our Help Desk Plan. We wanted to be able to provide a
set of services that was particularly geared toward a help desk. We
wanted to create a flat-fee-based service plan that was based on
the installation size, set up a priority support team that could
meet some of the customers' specific requirements, give a
guaranteed technician response time, include product training, and
provide customers with technical information bulletins that give
depth of information greater than what other customers might need.

LAN Mag: How do you differentiate the Help Desk Plan from the
primary support plans of traditional technical support services,
which provide free, ongoing technical support?

Walker: The Help Desk Plan doesn't replace the traditional plan.
For most of our customers the traditional plan is quite sufficient.
But there were additional services that especially the very large
customers were asking us for, so we felt like we needed to design a
plan to provide those.

LAN Mag: With an internal help desk application, or even if you
outsource the help desk functions, a staff can solve a variety of
problems, not just those related to one manufacturer or one type of
product. Does your help desk follow along the same lines, or is it
exclusive to WRQ's Reflection line?

Walker: Well, we don't have training on other products, but one of
the things that's been a differentiator of our technical support
across the board has been our desire to support customers in their
environment. In other words, we didn't want to pass the buck; if
the customer called us up with a problem with another piece of
software, we typically try to remain the point of contact, try to
solve the problem with them, or in some cases call the manufacturer
of the troublesome software. Sometimes it's our software that's
causing the problem, but the customer doesn't always really know.
And the boundaries between your software and someone else's are not
always very well defined. So one of the differentiators for us is
that we've always been willing to have an extended view of where
that boundary is.

LAN Mag: Are your help desk technicians using software at their end
in order to keep track of the number of calls open and log them in?

Walker: We use software from Scopus for tracking problems. We also
use it for development as well. It's our bug-tracking tool; in
other words, if test engineers were testing a product, they would
run it through Scopus. It's an integrated system involving everyone
across our development organisation. Also, all of our international
offices are integrated on the same system. Then, we have a
knowledge base set up of instances, problems, and solutions. We use
Verity's engine to search that.

LAN Mag: From a support standpoint, do you keep records of each
customer as they call in? For example, if a company called today
and then again in six months with a similar problem would your
technicians be able to call up that record?

Walker: With Scopus' system, when someone calls in, it tracks the
case, and that record is an event of your problem. The record of
the type of problem as an archetype goes into this knowledge base
that we track with the Verity search engine. We even keep
individual cases; just because it's solved, it's not dead. We count
on the knowledge base to archive a case.

LAN Mag: In general what has been some of the feedback that you've
received from customers who've heard about your new offerings?

Walker: We've gotten a lot of comments back from customers. We also
did a lot of beta with key customers beforehand, so for a lot of
our key customers, the announcement was anti-climactic because so
many of them already knew about it. But, right now it looks like
the feedback is really good. I don't have figures on how many
people have signed up for this, but we're very pleased with the
results so far.

LAN Mag: How have you dealt with customers' normal frustrations
when they call a technical support line?

Walker: One of the things that's a bit confusing about support is
that consumers have different requirements, depending on what
they're doing. For example, if you just bought a word processor,
and you just typed up your story, and you wanted to print it, but
you couldn't figure out how, you might call the customer support
line. And you would probably like to know as soon as possible which
button to press to print the document. So the amount of time that
you spend on hold would be a key source of dissatisfaction. If they
said, "I'll let you know in a week," that might not do.

Similarly, if you have a mainframe or some sort of central server
or computer, people need hardware support. And, basically, if the
power goes down or the disk drive just died, you need the
supporting manufacturer or support organisation to get it back up.

It's more complicated if you're buying corporate connectivity
software. There are fewer of the "How do I print this document?"
calls. The nice thing about those calls is that they're not very
complicated, but the need for immediate response is high. It's more
typical in systemwide connectivity that the problem is very
complex, so the time element is different. It might be a problem
that requires weeks to solve or even may require onsite analysis.

LAN Mag: You discussed how tech support has changed over the last
15 years. What is your general opinion on the tech support
available today?

Walker: A lot of my own experiences are both prior to WRQ and
during the early years of WRQ, when I was doing consulting. When
you do consulting, you're putting together systems from different
vendors to create a workable system. And the biggest frustration
that I had, especially with software, was system problems. I would
get an intrinsic problem in some software and often the support
organisation that I would call had no way of dealing with it. It
was beyond the scope of their definition of support. It wasn't
whether their support was good or bad, it was not.

If [a company's] support is not so good, you can complain more and
jump up and down and raise more hell. But when it's not, it's
harder. And that's the toughest situation that I used to run into.
I think a lot of people who have been consultants have run into
that problem. So that may have been one thing that has coloured our
attitude toward not setting limits on a systemwide penetration of a
support call.

I think that problem is even more acute for people these days due
to the complexity of networking. Networking is such a huge issue
today, and it wasn't so much a few years ago. Right now, the
software that's causing the IT professionals to lose sleep and pull
their hair out is networking and the connectivity software.

LAN Mag: Do you see tech support, whether it's good or bad, as a
key factor in customers' company loyalty?

Walker: It certainly seems to work for us. I try as often as I can
to work on key sales situations. You'll run into situations
sometimes where it's a real advantage to compete with a company
that already is installed in a site if their support is bad, as
opposed to both companies arriving at the customer's site and both
claiming to have a great product and great support.

Let's say in this case the other company's product is already
installed and the customer discovered that the support was not so
good. Our support becomes a key way to make sales and close the
deal. It is definitely one of the key questions for customers.

LAN Mag: Some studies suggest that half of the cost of software
ownership is taken up by support. Does that mean customers are
paying that much for technical support services?

Walker: It's your own support infrastructure. In other words, what
does it cost to own a PC? A very elementary analysis would be,
'What are PCs going for these days?' But the truth of the matter
is, when you put all of the time of your support organisation out
there, it might be double that. Certainly we find that true in our
own organisation. The sticker price is only about half the story.
Support means more than your IS person walking around, loading
software, and upgrading software.

LAN Mag: Do you feel your approach to support services is unique in
the industry?

Walker: Our view of support is a differentiating point with us, and
WRQ has, from the beginning, looked at itself as a long-term
company trying to establish long-term relationships with our
customers. From the beginning, we've wanted to have this solution
orientation, and wanted to provide support to our customers to
build that relationship because we were taking a long-term view.
Our attitude toward tech support is that it's extremely congruent
with our overall business philosophy. If you're looking at the way
we do support, it makes it all very reasonable.  LAN

NETWORKS: GETTING WEB EXPERTISE?

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

For those who are interested in getting a head start in Web
publishing but don't have the in-house expertise, Netframe Systems
has just introduced the ClusterServer 8560i, a fully-integrated
Intranet server solution.

"Most companies are excited about deploying on Intranet, but many
do not currently have the in-house expertise required to get
started, " said US-based Rob Van Naarden, VP of Sales, Netframe
Systems.

"All that the company's webmaster needs to do, is simply answer a
series of short questions in a standard wizard."

The new system comprises a high-capacity Netframe server, Intranet
tools, Web server software, Netframe's own Site Architect software
and a comprehensive range of templates, wizards, tutorials and
scripts. Using this suite of products, corporations can create the
structure for an Intranet and have their system on-line in less
than sixty minutes, claims Van Naarden.

The price of the server starts at less than US$25,000 for a fully
configured system, including software.

Users design their Web site with Site Architect and then add
content. Netframe even provides pre-formatted content for useful
Web information such as delivery tracking, airline and hotel
contact information.

Netframe's Intranet server is based on the company's ClusterServer
platform, Windows NT, the Microsoft Internet Information Server
(IIS), Microsoft Access database, and the Excite search engine, and
Netframe's Site Architect software.

Netframe has offices in Singapore, China, Japan, Hong Kong and
Australia.  LAN

NETWORKS: PCL 6 Speeds It Up

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The watched printer never prints. Instead, it sits calmly, lights
on, processing, taking its own sweet time-while you wait. For those
tired of the waiting game, Hewlett-Packard's (HP) new version of
Printer Control Language (PCL 6) decreases the downtime between the
print command and tactile gratification.

HP has been upgrading PCL since 1984, when the language was first
introduced to improve communication between laser printers and
workstations.

PCL 6 is designed for Windows and OS/2 environments that are
saturated with complex graphics. The Windows graphical direct
interface (GDI) commands are translated by the printer driver into
PCL commands, which are sent by the host computer to the printer
via the network or local parallel connection.

PCL firmware in the printer, in conjunction with the printer's
processor and memory, translates the PCL commands into dots. Then
the laser printer engine images the dots onto paper.

Complex documents print faster because the printer's PCL 6 firm-
ware and hardware process smaller, more compact object-oriented
commands for graphics rather than long strings of code sequences.

For example, using PCL 5e, 1,130 bytes are needed to print a
rectangle with rounded corners. PCL 6 prints the rectangle using 19
bytes, reducing the amount of traffic.

PCL 6 also allows users to regain control of their PC and
applications sooner because the printer driver quickly translates
the GDI commands to PCL 6.

Improved print quality is another aspect of PCL 6. Users get true
WYSIWYG printing because the PCL commands that define a document
map more closely to GDI commands, and the Windows printer driver
automatically downloads fonts within a document to the printer if
they are not loaded on the printer.

In addition, PCL 6 has complete backward compatibility. For the
benefit of users today, PCL 6 is currently included in HP's latest
range of LaserJet 5, 5N, and 5M laser printers.  LAN

NETWORKS: UB Networks Revamps Support

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

UB Networks may be in an iffy position with regards to its future
parent but it is toning up to remain in the business. Peter Ciceri,
vice-president and general manager of Asia-Pacific operations
recently let on that a comprehensive revamp of their customer
support programme was due.

At press time the sprucing up had barely begun but Ciceri promised
that UB faithfuls could look forward to a "channels-ready, end-user
driven support programme".

"We will concentrate on professional services, customer care and
post-sales support," said Ciceri. "End users can look forward to
even obtaining level one service direct from UB should they choose
to. Certified channel partners can provide up to level two support.

"The end user will determine who [the VARs or UB] he wants to work
with," said Ciceri. He added that directors for services and
customer care would soon be hired.

UB has been trying to establish itself outside of the high end
segment. Said Ciceri, "We need to take price cuts [in the mid- to
low-end] to build the market." However, Ciceri felt that UB was
strong enough at the high-end: "We have reset prices across the
region to meet competitor prices aggressively."  LAN

NETWORKS: Hughes Provides Satellite Link

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

If the current crop of wide area connectivity options doesn't give
you the performance or speed you've been hoping for, NetWare-
centric users can now harness the speed of satellite communication
for applications such as broadcasting large files to a number of
locations and shared high-speed Internet access.

DirecPC for NetWare, jointly developed by Hughes Network Systems,
Helius, and Cisco Systems, builds on a standalone product released
by HNS in 1994. The networked version includes hardware from HNS,
ISA card for the NetWare server, Internet Junction IPX-to-TCP/IP
software from Cisco, and LAN-to-satellite integration software from
Helius.

DirecPC provides two services: Turbo Internet and Digital Package
Delivery. Turbo Internet allows users to dial in to their ISP
through a browser and send requests through a modem. The Digital
Package Delivery service provides a way to deliver data files to
multiple locations through a single broadcast at speeds of 3 Mbps.

NETWORKS: Olicom Raises Profile

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Denmark's Olicom is laying the groundwork for a drive into the
workgroup switching market with Token Ring, Fast Ethernet and 155
Mbps ATM hardware due out in early '97. Olicom, with regional
offices in Singapore and Hong Kong, has been established in Asia
for a couple of years, but has yet to be known outside of the Token
Ring sphere.

Michael Jonsson, vice-president of international sales, said that
this impression was going to change. First on the to-do list would
be an upgrade of all support services for the region to pave the
way.

"We need to build up the support programmes because we are not
prepared yet. We have a low profile in Asia-Pacific," said Jonsson.

"One part of the rejuvenated support plan involves more pre-sales
staff in Asia. They will help the end-user do testing for product
suitability and directly work with them."

For Level 2 technical support, Jonsson said that a central site
would be set up in Sydney by the end of the year to provide 24
hour, multi-language phone support. Customers would be given 1-800
numbers and calls would be automatically routed to open support
offices. "However, we believe that nine out of ten questions can be
solved by Level 1 support," said Jonsson. Olicom's distributors and
VARs would provide Level 1 support. Two of Olicom's VARs here are
ITS and Teledata.  LAN

NETWORKS: ManageWise Grabs NT and Java

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The story of ManageWise has always been about the expanding reach
of the management console, according to Prem Uppaluru, Novell's
vice president and general manager of the company's management and
administration division.

When Novell combined its NetWare Management System (NMS) with
Intel's LANDesk Manager in early 1995, the server-centric and
network topology functions of NMS were added to the primarily
desktop-oriented functions of LANDesk. ManageWise 2.0 incorporated
user administration into the product and also added features that
support management by third-party service providers, such as
integrators and value-added resellers.

Novell's management and administration division is currently
beginning to pass along the results of last year's initiatives by
delivering cross-platform networking services, rather than
proprietary file and print transport services. ManageWise 2.1, set
for release in the third quarter of 1996, extends the product
beyond the NetWare space. The new version includes a management
agent for NT Server that allows the ManageWise console to
configure, control, monitor, and troubleshoot the heretofore
foreign servers using the same interface and the same SNMP access
mechanism it uses for NetWare servers.

New client support in ManageWise 2.1 includes OS/2 Warp and Windows
95, and Windows NT Workstation support is due by the end of 1996.
Novell has restructured its relationship with Intel to eliminate
out-of-sync update problems, with Novell taking responsibility for
upgrading the ManageWise components; Novell will provide those
components to Intel for its separate line of LANDesk products.

Upgrades to ManageWise in 1997 will include a Web browser console,
which will provide cross-platform access to management and
administration data, and Java applets executing on NetWare servers
and on the browser system will deliver such capabilities as real-
time traffic monitoring and disk drive utilisation statistics.  LAN

NETWORKS: Novell Brings Out IntranetWare

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Convert the majority of its NetWare 3.x users over to Netware 4.11,
Novell has decided to launch IntranetWare in Asia. IntranetWare is
a bundling sweetener that will include the latest NetWare 4.11
(code-named Green River, NetWare Web Server, Netscape Navigator,
Web-site authoring tools and a multiprotocol router for WAN and
Internet connections.

"We are now making it very compelling for users to go on to NetWare
4.11. Previously, they may not have seen any real benefit upgrading
to NetWare 4, but today we are offering them ready components for
Intranet. With IntranetWare, users are only adding value to
existing network," said Derek Foo, Novell's managing director for
Singapore and S.E Asia region.

IntranetWare enables IT managers to choose how and when they want
to transition their corporate networks to intranets, by allowing
them to selectively install those networking components.

Novell is giving organisations a platform upon which they can add
ManageWise and GroupWise to create full-service intranets that will
include directory, security, file, print, management and messaging.

To access the intranet, users only need to launch the Netscape
Navigator browser from any desktop workstation and pass network
traffic to the server for IPX-to-IP translation.

Traditionally, network administrators had to install and maintain a
separate IP stack on each desktop to provide NetWare clients with
access to IP-based intranet or Internet services. Because IP is
only deployed on the IntranetWare server, administrators save time
and money by tracking and maintaining only one IP address per group
of users.

When organisations are ready to move to IP, IntranetWare supports
TCP/IP with dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and BootP to
ease IP address management. Future enhancements to IntranetWare
will feature full firewall and proxy cache capabilities. The
product will ship in October.  LAN

NETWORKS: Continuity Plan

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The Singapore Computer Society has established a new sub-group (or
chapter, as they call it) in late August.

Called the Business Continuity Group (BCG), it aims to promote
Business Continuity as an essential component of business strategy.

As explained by group president Goh Moh Heng, Business Continuity
goes beyond disaster recovery which is merely the IT part of the
strategy.

Organisations with a Business Continuity plan can gain more time
for a total infrastructure revamp should disaster strike.

In the long run, the BCG also intends to tie-up with organisations
in the US or the UK to run examinations in Asia to certify BC
specialists.

Goh said that the affiliated organisation had not been decided yet
although one possibility could be the Disaster Recovery Institute
of the US.

At press time, a first conference was scheduled to run in Singapore
on Sep 30 as part of the BCG's activities.  LAN

NETWORKS: D-Link Rounds Out Customer Service

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

D-link is putting the final touches to a sophisticated 24-hour
customer service programme which it says will raise their
responsiveness several fold for both their VARs and end-users. "We
are now three months into the programme and field problems have
been drastically reduced by 50 per cent because of our problem
tracking system," said Henry Ngai, D-Link's vice-president of
marketing and customer support.

The new programme uses Australia as a global support centre with
Singapore as the regional support centre, and arms D-link support
staff with a Lotus Notes-based intranet for access to a
synchronised solution database and customer equipment purchase
records and problem logs.

Said Ngai: "If Australia logs off, customers can call the UK and
they would have the same records there. Databases are synchronised.
Calls can be forwarded to the different customer service units as
well. The nature of support is really trial and error." In the
past, each country maintained its own database of customers.

Said Ngai, "Problems have been promptly identified and support
staff can fax or download from the web."

The D-link support structure consists of 3 layers. Level 1 problems
are mostly to do with parameters and settings. These are non-system
problems. Level 2 engineers handle problem tracking and isolation.
Level 3 engineers fix the bugs and solve those problems which
cannot be solved in the field.

"We have relocated level 2 support into the testing labs. The
company has spent between US$5 to US$6 million on equipment and we
are sure that we can replicate all problems encountered in our
labs. In the past, some problems were not tracked," said Ngai.

At the centre of the programme is a new independent customer
service division (CSD), which controls customer service units in
each country. "Now, no matter what the query, the CSD will handle
the matter," said Ngai.  LAN

NETWORKS: Video Link Options

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Lucent's Multipoint Conferencing Unit (MCU), release 4.0 has been
introduced into the Asian market as ISDN services get ever more
popular and economical.

Features to be noted in this version are options for data sharing
through a video link, the expansion of four access ports to 64, and
to include four on-screen callers, with the ability to visually
link 24 locations on a single MCU or 46 locations between two
connected MCUs, which the sales support manager of Lucent's
business communications systems division, Lawrence Lee claims is
not offered by any other system.

"Through the feature of continuous presence plus we can deliver
this kind of switching, whereas our competitors can only view five
fixed locations with additional participants being heard, not
seen," he said.

The system is capable of transmitting voice, video, and data at
speeds from 112 to 1920 Kbps, supporting ITU standards H.320 and
T.120 for video and data conferencing respectively. Additionally,
release 4.0 is compatible with algorithms used on videoconferencing
systems from Intel, PictureTel, and Compression Labs.

According to Lee, the product is expected to be well accepted,
especially in markets such as Hong Kong where PRI ISDN is to be
launched by the end of this year, and in China where private
networks can avail of facilities such as videoconferencing.

Users may be interested to know there is an additional upgrade
investment plan, which allows the client to set up an annual or
monthly payment schedule for future upgrades, with automatic
updates of hardware and software once they become available.  LAN

NETWORKS: ATM Banks in China

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

The LAN business unit of Datacraft China is about to construct
Shenzhen Development Bank's (SDB) entire branch networking
infrastructure based on ATM technology.

SDB has purchased Cisco's Lightstream 1010 switch, Catalyst 5000
and 3000 Ethernet switches, Cisco 7507 and 2522 routers, as well as
stackable hubs from Bay Networks. The system, which is to provide
LAN connections with IP/IPX, is expected to offer connectivity to
70 branches of the bank throughout Shenzhen in mainland China.

Enhanced bandwidth for multimedia applications, will be available
via the ATM technology using China's high-speed digital data
network (DDN) backbone.

The contract is worth US$680,000, the largest of the total four now
managed by Datacraft in the Guangdong province of China, with three
in Shenzhen and one in Zhuhei.

But although the LAN market-base in China is huge, the profit
margin is small, with so many vendors now fighting for market
share.

Said Stanley Chan, Datacraft's South China account manager :"How do
you compete with other distributors who represent the same vendor
such as Cisco. It is cut-throat competition."  LAN

NETWORKS: Get Management Tools

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

For those who are venturing out from the relatively safe
environments of host-based computing and the centralised management
view, now might be a good time to try client-server as the number
of systems management products are starting to surface in Asia.

Getting an application management product to integratewith your
existing network management platform is a good place to start. One
company which dabbles in apps management is Compuware.

Compuware has a line-up of mainframe management products but it is
their client-server range that catches the eye. Central to it all
are its Econet and Ecotools products which allow managment of apps
on the LAN/WAN and servers, respectively.

Ecotools work through polling agents residing in your distributed
hardware and offers event management, performance monitoring and
resource monitoring. Econet monitors apps traffic on the network
with RMON probes and can be set to notify you should thresholds be
exceeded. A modeling tool is included to allow you to test adds and
changes before any physical work is begun.

Compuware's international sales manager for Ecosystems, Gary Angel,
revealed that a new product, Ecoclient, would soon be available to
allow fault-detection and diagnosis on hung apps. "It would take
the terminal information and see which module failed. It can then
page you, trap information and show enough so that engineers can
fix the code," he said.

"Start to evaluate management tools today. Don't add apps and
servers first because it will get too messy," said Angel. "Consider
tools such as apps management first to get the apps up 100 per cent
of the time."  LAN

NETWORKS: Switches Rule!

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Industry consultant Tom Noelle, president of US-based CMI, predicts
that routers will eventually be replaced by switches."Users are
still going to have some performance determinism loss even if you
build a switched virtual core," says Noelle. "The funtion of a
router is inherently non-deterministic. A LAN switch is the only
solution that allow users to allocate resources specifically to the
application flow."

As compaines move into enterprise TCP/IP, many will develop a
requirement for central-policy management. "A user can't just
request for any amount of bandwidth," said Noelle. "Some mechanism
has to inform the network how much bandwidth to allocate."

By moving into policy-bandwidth management, the industry is
drifting away from the concept of routers. Routers were designed
with the idea that end-systems decided what they were going to send
and the network just carried it.

Cisco realises that the router is doomed as a strategic device,
which is why it is now moving into the switching arena.  LAN

NETWORKS: MORE ROUTERS TO THE EDGE, BUILD ATM CORE

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

If you want performance determinism, then you don't want routers.
This is the view taken by Tom Noelle, president of US-based CIMI, a
network consultancy firm.

A router, according to Noelle, is simply nothing more than a
connectionless device. "Routers do not allow users to allocate
resources to a particular information flow in a way that's really
effective," said Noelle

"If I have an e-mail and video flow through a router, it doesn't
know the difference between the two and can't give one of them
priority over the other."

So does this spell the death of routers in networks? Apparently,
not just yet.

Router vendors are working hard to improve this. There's now a
protocol called RSVP or Resource Reservation Protocol that is
supposed to provide the prioritisation of important traffic flows.

"The only problem with RSVP is that it's easy for routers to make a
reservation but it's hard to fill one. In terms of implementation,
what do you do in a router to make this flow work better that that
flow," said Noelle.

The solution is to have a check list to see which particular flow
should be given priority. However, this can be very time-consuming
especially if you have a very long list.

Router vendors have also come out with the solution of sticking a
virtual circuit processor on the router to make their routing
process more efficient. "But even if you do this, you are still
routing," Noelle cautioned.

Cisco's architecture like NetFlow, for example, builds virtual
circuits with a packet processor that runs underneath the router to
reduce the amount of information the router handles.

"The only way to make a router deterministic is to stop making it a
router. So why not go the rest of the way by not having it there to
start off with," said Noelle.

Users should instead consider LAN switches. Routing could exist
only at one place in the network and that is where a connectionless
LAN has to be connected into a virtual circuit infrastructure,
according to Noelle.

"My advice is to build a virtual circuit core with Frame Relay or
ATM switching and push all the routers to the very edge of the
network. Once you've done that, begin to replace them with LAN
switches on a phase by phase basis," said Noelle. "Use routers only
where you don't have any performance problems."

The router, added Noelle, will eventually become a small low-cost
device that's subservient to the ATM network, instead of the
building block of the network itself, added Noelle.  LAN

NETWORKS: LAN MAGAZINE: EDITORIAL: A New Frontier

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

Having a bold vision alone is just not enough.

What sets Malaysia apart from the rest of the pack, is its
willingness to take a risk on leading-edge technologies. With the
nation's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) taking shape and with the
merging of telecommunications and networking technologies, Malaysia
and the rest of Southeast-Asia can be assured of contributing and
having a major impact on the world in the future of networking.

Even non-IT business executives are trying to grasp the concept of
the MSC, envisioned by the Prime Minister of Malaysia. But what
will ensure its success, as Oracle's chief operating officer Ray
Lane correctly points out, is the clarity and vision of this
concept.

A concept where attitude becomes a competitive advantage. And
Malaysia, he adds, is the first institution that has put forth
attitude in these critical factors for competitive advantage. The
PM of Malaysia, himself, is personally taking an aggressive role in
pushing IT into government institutions and universities.

Critics say that the Multimedia Super Corridor serves merely to
prolong the life of the country's booming economy. And they are not
wrong. Besides cheaper labour and lower operating costs, Malaysia
is also offering extremely attractive incentive schemes to lure
companies to relocate their headquarters, R&D as well as
manufacturing facilities along the MSC.

But more importantly, Malaysia aims to be the technology showcase
for the Asian region. Plans are in the pipeline to build individual
state networks and eventually link all thirteen states
electronically.

For a start, universities are now in the process of implementing
the latest high-speed networks such as ATM.

Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia just purchased 68 Centillion 100
Multi LAN/ATM switches from Bay Networks. The number of switches
installed across the campus is expected to make UKM one of the
largest ATM sites in the world. The network today connects about 40
buildings, covering more than 8 square kilometers of the campus.

But mind you, the UKM network is only part of a strategic nation-
wide push by the Malaysian government to network within the
community and leapfrog into the age of digital economy.

Riding the same route as the Internet, ATM networks will first
spring from universities and eventually, spread into the commercial
arenas through joint projects and partnerships .

Other early adopters of ATM are the technology parks, as they'll be
the first homes for new multimedia developers that will move into
the MSC. Hi-tech companies will want to run their sophisticated
systems and development tools on high-speed networking technology.

Ironically, the recent Kuala Lumpur City Centre project did cause a
stir among some ardent proponents of ATM. Imagine KLCC, Malaysia's
pride and joy, was going to use FDDI for its backbone, they
muttered.

"Why would anybody want to use such an outdated technology," said
one puzzled senior executive from a US-based networking company.
"Not only can it not carry multimedia traffic, in real terms, FDDI
is also very expensive. If anyone is looking for a backbone
technology today that is proven and stable, ATM is the obvious
solution."

However, conservative users contend that many of the major ATM
specs are still not out yet and that any "standard-compliant" ATM
products available today are somewhat proprietary.

Still, whoever wins the KL project (which is estimated to be in the
region of US$100 million) will be basking in the limelight. It's a
massive undertaking that's never be done before in the world, say
industry observers.

Like it or not, all eyes will be focused on Malaysia for the next
couple of years. Networking vendors are looking to Malaysia not
only for an ATM testbed but for other riskier technologies; and
later, hopefully, a shining example for the rest of the region to
emulate.

NETWORKS: LAN MAGAZINE: EDITORAL

from LAN MAGAZINE, October 1996

As trade journalists, if there is one thing that we abhore more
than having to get into the office before ten in the morning it is
the bundle of phrases that fall under the banner of technospeak.
You must know them: the technical acroynms eg. SNMP, 100Base-T,
segmentation, RMON, agents and LAN Emulation. Or the concept jargon
where one word or phrase supposedly explains a sheaf of network
topologies eg. VLANs, SMP, Switched Workgroups, intranet. All a
kind of industry shorthand to be shared and bandied around among
those in the know.

To explain to users and network manager how the many new hardware
products fit in with existing networks, our writers most of the
time have to get to the very basics of a concept usually dunked
before them wholesale by the vendors, who also do their utmost to
convince us that their product does everything well. And even match
the colour of the carpet.

This is where the shorthand technospeak of the networking industry
kicks in. But what we are worried about is a new range of phrases
which are being shoehorned into the networking industry from the PC
world.

If you have been to enough seminars, you will know that the phrase
"total solution" is used far too liberally. The top hardware
vendors are guilty of this. Everyone claims to be a total solution
provider, and yet they have only recently acquired new companies to
fill out gaps in their product line up.

Plug-n-Play is another phrase that is totally inappropriate for the
networking world. And yet vendors just entering the small
office/remote office market are throwing this around to add glitz
to their new range of hardware. We even encountered sales managers
from the most well known router company who said, with a straight
face, that their new routers for this market were PnP. We fail to
see how configuring router tables can be an easy process. Perhaps
the sales contract includes free foreign labour.

In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king. In the land of
networking, snowjobs are increasing. Nowhere more so than in Asia
where certified NetWare professionals remain in shortsupply and
where UTP cabling is left to pullers without installation
certification at all. Where some with NetWare and TCP/IP basics, a
couple of years under his belt and a knack for Adobe Pagemill and
MS Word 6 can profess to be an intranet consultant. (We kid you
not)

We dare say that most of the time the vendors don't help either.
Maybe you caught the shifty dealings of the most well known NOS
vendor last month when another trade journal exposed its selective
manipulation of analyst data to place itself higher in the market
share stakes. Apparently the Microsoft marketing hoopla method is
being studied by competitors as well.

And the BS shovelling is not confined to salesmen. Visiting senior
executives can fall under the spell as well. Our latest encounter
was with a networking NIC vendor whose CEO popped into town for a
visit. On being asked about their business in Asia, he gave the oft
heard dazzle about how Asia is their fastest growing market, how it
will be their largest soon, blah blah.

What the executive did not realise was that the journalist
interviewing him before us was a close colleague of ours who had
grilled him to admit that his Asian market share had actually been
falling by more than a couple of percentage points since the year
past and that there had been difficulties with the authorities in
obtaining type approval.

The bottom line really is not to look for how cheap the product is
or how well the company name is lit in neon. The days of vendors
merely moving boxes in volume is not that far behind us. The only
real benefit is that networking technology does work.

So as you settle in with this latest offering from the Miller
Freeman publishing group, keep us in mind. We welcome all news and
letters, gripes and tips. Call or e-mail to aptnet@singnet. com.sg
and help us eradicate the snowjobs.
