JETSKI SURVIVORS CAN SEEK
STATE LAW DAMAGES,
HIGH COURT CONCLUDES

     The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 9 unanimously affirmed the
Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' November 1994 determination
that the damages recoverable by a jetski accident victim's
survivors are not limited to those available under the general
maritime cause of action for wrongful death.  Yamaha Motor Corp.
U.S.A. et al. v. Calhoun et al., No. 94-1387 (U.S.); see Consumer
Product Litigation Reporter, September 1995.

     In an opinion authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the
high court agreed that the cause of action established in Moragne
v. States Marine Lines (U.S. 1970) does not displace state
remedies in maritime wrongful death actions where no applicable
federal statute controls and the decedent was not a seaman or
otherwise engaged in the maritime trade.

     Twelve-year-old Natalie Calhoun was killed in a 1989
accident while piloting a "Wavejammer" jetski manufactured by the
petitioner Yamaha Motor Corp. U.S.A.  Natalie had rented the
product while vacationing in Puerto Rico, and died when the
vehicle struck a vessel anchored off her hotel's frontage.

     Her parents brought suit in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania the following year, basing their
claims in Pennsylvania's wrongful death and survival statutes and
demanding damages including lost future earnings, loss of
society, loss of support and services and punitive damages.
Yamaha sought partial summary judgment, arguing that Moragne
displaced state frameworks for awarding maritime wrongful death
damages.

     The trial court agreed, but held that the Calhouns could
still viably make demand for loss of society and loss of support
and services.  The parties cross-appealed; the Third Circuit
ruled on Nov. 2 that Moragne would not preempt state wrongful
death statutes on claims over non-seamen within territorial
waters.  The high court agreed to review the decision in
May 1995.

     In its affirmance, the Supreme Court stated that
"[t]raditionally, state remedies have been applied in accident
cases of this order " maritime wrongful death cases in which no
federal statute specifies the appropriate relief and the decedent
was not a seaman, longshore worker, or person otherwise engaged
in a maritime trade.  We hold, in accord with the United States
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, that state remedies
remain applicable in such cases and have not been displaced by
the federal maritime wrongful death action recognized in
Moragne."

     As a preliminary matter, the high court held that the
federal appellate courts have jurisdiction in an interlocutory
appeal "over any question that is included within the order that
contains the controlling question of law identified by the
district court."  Justice Ginsburg found the text of 28 U.S.C.
Section 1292(b) to indicate that "appellate jurisdiction applies
to the order certified to the court of appeals, and is not tied
to the particular question formulated by the district court."

     In turning to the substantive issue, the Supreme Court found
that "[t]he exercise of admiralty [jurisdiction] 'does not result
in automatic displacement of state law'....  Indeed, prior to
Moragne, federal admiralty courts routinely applied state
wrongful death and survival statutes in maritime accident cases."

     The court engaged in a review of wrongful death claims under
maritime law that reached back to its 1886 decision in The
Harrisburg.  The court had then concluded that general maritime
law did not recognize a cause of action for wrongful death;
subsequently, Justice Ginsburg wrote, "[f]ederal admiralty courts
tempered the harshness of The Harrisburg's rule by allowing
recovery under state wrongful death statutes."

     With the publication of Moragne in 1970, the high court
overruled The Harrisburg and concluded that an action "lie[s]
under general maritime law for death caused by violation of
maritime duties."

     Here, the high court found Yamaha's contention that Moragne
encompasses all deaths in state territorial waters to be "not
without force; in several contexts, we have recognized that
vindication of maritime policies demanded uniform adherence to a
federal rule of decision, with no leeway for variation or
supplementation by state law."

     Ultimately, the high court wrote, the concerns for
uniformity that prompted the scuttling of The Harrisburg "were of
a different order than those invoked by Yamaha.  Moragne did not
reexamine the soundness of The Harrisburg out of concern that
state damage awards in maritime wrongful death cases were
excessive, or that variations in the remedies afforded by the
States threatened to interfere with the harmonious operation of
maritime law."

               The inconsistencies in maritime law that prompted the
Moragne court, Justice Ginsburg concluded, "relate to ships and
the workers who serve them, and to a distinctly maritime
substantive concept " the unseaworthiness doctrine."  The court
concluded that Moragne "centered on the extension of relief, not
on the contraction of remedies.  The decision recalled that 'it
better becomes the humane and liberal character of proceedings in
admiralty to give than to withhold the remedy, when not required
to withhold it by established and inflexible rules.'"

     The opinion lastly cited at length to the reasoning below of
the Third Circuit, which had noted that "Congress has not
prescribed remedies for the wrongful deaths of nonseafarers in
territorial waters."

IN SUPREME CT.: AIRBAG
NEGLIGENCE CLAIM NOT
PREEMPTED BY SAFETY ACT

     The Indiana Supreme Court on Dec. 28 overturned a lower
court's grant of summary judgment favoring General Motors and
determined that the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act
does not preempt a common law negligence claim based on failure
to install airbags.  Wilson et al. v. Pleasant et al., No. 64S03-
9506-CV-693 (IN Sup. Ct.).

     The lawsuit was lodged by the estate of James Wilson, who
died in a 1988 head-on collision while driving a 1986 Chevrolet.
Wilson had not been wearing a seat belt at the time of the
accident.  The suit, which named the driver of the other vehicle
as well as GM, alleged that the manufacturer was negligent in
designing, manufacturing and selling a car that wasn't
crashworthy due to the lack of an airbag passive restraint
system.

     GM sought summary judgment from the Porter County Superior
Court, arguing that the estate's common law claims were federally
preempted by the Safety Act and certain safety regulations
promulgated thereunder.  The trial court granted the motion; the
Indiana Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed, declaring that
while the Safety Act did not expressly preempt the negligence
claim, implied preemption could be found.

               In its review, the state high court preliminarily noted the
language of the Safety Act's preemption clause (Section 1392[d])
and state common law savings clause (Section 1397[k]); the panel
also observed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208, which
gave the manufacturer three options for providing passenger crash
protection.  The court acknowledged that the manual seat belt
system in Wilson's car fully complied with the third option.

     The court agreed with the Court of Appeals' assessment that
the Safety Act did not expressly preempt the estate's claim.
"The pre-emption clause found in the Safety Act explicitly
refers, with respect to 'any motor vehicle or item of motor
vehicle equipment,' only to state 'safety standard[s] applicable
to the same aspect of performance of such vehicle or item of
equipment which is not identical to the federal standard,'" the
panel wrote.

     As to the finding of implied preemption, however, the court
observed that the "clear weight of authority prior to 1992
supported General Motors's view that the Safety Act impliedly
pre-empts state common law claims like the one asserted by
Wilson."  The panel then engaged in a review of the alterations
to the federal preemption analysis wrought by the U.S. Supreme
Court's rulings in Cipollone v. Liggett Group (1992) and
Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick (1995).

     "[W]e cannot help observing that Myrick did not overrule
Cipollone," the court concluded.  "Rather, the Supreme Court held
that interpretations of Cipollone to the effect that implied
pre-emption cannot exist when Congress has chosen to include an
express pre-emption clause were incorrect interpretations."

     The court read Cipollone/Myrick to establish the following
analysis in order to establish implied preemption:  "First, if
the federal statute at issue contains pre-emption language, we
determine whether that provision alone provides a reliable
indication of congressional intent with respect to its
pre-emptive effect," the panel wrote.  Such determination would
be made, the court stated, "by employing canons of statutory
construction and by examining the other provisions of the statute
" and the statute as a whole " to see if they offer any cause to
look beyond the express pre-emption language."

     If a reliable indication of congressional intent is found,
the panel wrote, there is no need to look beyond the preemption
language itself.  Otherwise, the court continued, "we must
determine whether the state law in question is in actual conflict
with federal law, [i.e.,] (1) whether it is impossible for a
private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,
or (2) whether the state law stands as an obstacle to the
accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives
of Congress."

     In turning to the facts at hand, the court found it
"immediately obvious that the Section 1392(d) pre-emption clause
in the Safety Act, taken alone, does not provide a reliable
indication of congressional intent with respect to its
pre-emptive effect."  The panel also found that the language of
the Section 1397(k) savings clause indicated that the Safety
Act's preemptive scope is not governed entirely by the Act's
preemption language.

     The court concluded, however, that the language of Section
1392(d) and Section 1397(k) read together foreclosed an
application of an implied preemption analysis.  "[W]e see only a
prohibition on state motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment
safety standards not identical to federal safety standards
applicable to the same aspect of performance of the motor vehicle
or item of motor vehicle equipment," the court wrote.

     Although the panel determined a full implied preemption
analysis to be unnecessary, it engaged in such a review and still
found no preemption of the claims.  "[W]e conclude that there is
no conflict between state common law in this case and the choices
presented by Rule 208," the panel wrote.  "Assuming, arguendo,
that Indiana common law requires airbags, there would be no
conflict with Rule 208 because Rule 208 does not prohibit airbags
" it only permits some other alternatives."

     The court also found that a finding of implied preemption
here "would be inconsistent with the purpose of and policies
underlying the Safety Act....  It would defeat the purpose of the
statute if manufacturers were not discouraged from utilizing a
safety system that would otherwise be considered negligent under
state common law tort theories."

     James W. Myers III, Valparaiso, IN, and David H. Knobel,
Merrillville, IN, represent the appellant.

     David M. Heilbron and Leslie G. Landau of McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown & Enersen, San Francisco, and Alex Dimitrief of Kirkland &
Ellis, Chicago, represent General Motors.

MICHIGAN JURY FINDS NO
DEFECT IN THREE-WHEEL ATV

     A Michigan federal court jury returned a unanimous verdict
for Honda Motor Co. defendants Dec. 7, finding that a 1985 Honda
ATC-125M three-wheel all-terrain vehicle was not defective.
Carwile v. Honda Research & Development Co., Ltd. et al. (ED MI).

     The jury also found that the Honda defendants were not
negligent with respect to the design and marketing of the ATV or
the warnings that accompanied the vehicle.

     The accident occurred in April 1991 on a sandy trail near
Jensen Beach, FL.  Plaintiff Manford Carwile, who was not wearing
a helmet, careened into a tree after entering an S-curve and
suffered a severe closed head injury.

     Plaintiff claimed that design defects made it difficult to
turn the ATV, and also alleged that Honda failed to adequately
warn about the risks of operating the vehicles.  Honda countered
that Carwile's accident was caused by excessive speed,
inattention and inadequate vehicle maintenance.

     Expert witnesses for the plaintiff were engineer David
Renfroe; Edward Karnes on the adequacy of warnings; Werner Spitz,
M.D., on toxicology and helmet injury-prevention; Gary
Lustgarden, M.D., a neurosurgeon; Robert Ancell, a vocational
rehabilitation expert; Eric Amberg, a neuropsychologist; and
economist Michael Thompson.

     Honda called Kevin Breen, an expert on vehicle design,
accident reconstruction and off-road vehicle riding; Harry H.
Hurt Jr., on the design and protection offered by motorcycle
helmets; and Dr. Philip Haber, on vocational rehabilitation.
Honda also called Masayuka Tanaka, an employee of Honda R&D Co.,
Ltd., to discuss ATV development and design, and Edward Glynn, an
employee of American Honda Motor Co., to discuss Honda's ATV
safety efforts and the Consumer Product Safety Commission
investigation of the vehicles.

     Honda was represented by Robert K. Miller, Larry C. Mann and
Timothy J. Mattson of Bowman and Brooke in Minneapolis and
Detroit.  Carwile was represented by Steven Leuchtman and Frank
Mafrice of Sommers, Schwartz, Silver & Schwartz in Detroit.

ALABAMA JURY AWARDS
$120,000 ON DEFECTIVE
SUZUKI FOUR-WHEEL ATV

     An Alabama state court jury awarded $200,000 in damages to
plaintiff Bobby G. Norman, who claimed that a defective throttle
cable in his Suzuki four-wheel all-terrain vehicle led to a loss-
of-control accident in which he suffered serious injuries.
Norman v. Longshore Cycle Center et al., No. CV-93-56
(AL Cir. Ct., Lauderdale Cty.).

     Norman bought the ATV from co-defendant Longshore Cycle
Center.  When riding away from a neighbor's house, he turned the
handlebars of the ATV as far to the right as he could, at which
point the throttle went wide open and the vehicle flew over an
embankment.

     The plaintiff went airborne, coming to rest after hitting a
tree and having the ATV flip over with him underneath.  He
sustained numerous cuts and abrasions on his arms and legs, and
tore his right shoulder rotator cuff.  The treating orthopedic
surgeon gave him a 50-50 chance that surgery could alleviate his
condition.

     At the time of the accident, the ATV had only 50 miles of
use.  Norman's expert witness, Michael Burleson of Tyler, TX,
tested exemplar throttle cables manufactured by Suzuki, Honda,
Kawasaki and Yamaha to determine how much force was needed to
cause a separation.  All of the other brands not only out-
performed the Suzuki cable, but were more substantial in
appearance, he opined.

     The defendants argued that the accident was caused by
operator error and Norman's failure to take the offered free
safety course.  Their expert witness, Kris Kubly of Madison, WI,
tested the exemplar throttle cables and the actual cable involved
in the accident and found no possibility of malfunction as
claimed by the plaintiff.

     Norman was represented by Debra H. Coble and Frank B. Potts
of Potts & Young in Florence, AL.  Longshore Cycle Center was
represented by Danny D. Henderson of Huntsville, AL.  Suzuki was
represented by John Bergquist of Parsons, Lee & Juliano in
Birmingham, AL.

HIGH CT. REJECTS
CROSS-PETITIONS FOR REVIEW
OF RISK-UTILITY RULING

     The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 8 denied the separate bids of
Honda Motor Co. and a Mississippi plaintiff to overturn the Fifth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' May 1995 determinations in a
motorcycle product liability action.  Honda Motor Co. et al. v.
Satcher, No. 95-653 (U.S.); Satcher v. Honda Motor Co. et al.,
No. 95-674 (U.S.); see Consumer Product Litigation Reporter,
November 1995.

     The manufacturer had asserted that the appellate panel had
infringed its due process rights in refusing a new trial, and
James Satcher had averred that the Fifth Circuit had no basis on
which to vacate his $2 million award for punitive damages.

     Satcher, who had been driving the defendant's Nighthawk
motorcycle in the 1985 traffic accident that cost him his leg,
obtained $1 million in compensatory damages following a 1991 jury
trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Mississippi.  In its initial review of the case in 1993, the
Fifth Circuit reversed.  The panel concluded that as a matter of
state law, the product's claimed defect (lack of leg guards) was
open and obvious to the ordinary consumer.

     Following the Mississippi Supreme Court's issuance of
Sperry-New Holland v. Prestage (1993) shortly thereafter, the
Fifth Circuit vacated its prior ruling and ordered the district
court to reconsider in light of Prestage (which held that the
risk-utility analysis superseded the consumer expectations test
in product liability actions) and the state's recently enacted
product liability statute.  The trial court found for Satcher on
remand.

     In its affirmance of last May 30, the Fifth Circuit rejected
Honda's contentions that it was entitled to a new trial as
Prestage caused a substantive alteration to Mississippi law.  The
panel did strike Satcher's punitive award, concluding that the
defendant's conduct in not including leg guards in its product
design was not so extreme or outrageous as to support it.

     Both litigants filed petitions for writ of certiorari in the
high court late last October.  Honda contended that it was
entitled to new trial in order to defend on a risk-utility
theory, rather than under the consumer expectations test.
Satcher argued that under the Fifth Circuit's punitive damages
standard, such awards may be reversed on a showing of "mere
disagreement in the scientific community as to whether the
defendant's conduct was reasonable."

     Mack E. Barham and Robert E. Arcenaux of Barham & Arcenaux,
PLC, New Orleans; Peter K. Smith, Quitman, MS; Wilton L.
Strickland, Fort Lauderdale, FL; and Ray Ferrero Jr. of Ferrero &
Middlebrooks, P.A., Fort Lauderdale, represent James Satcher.

B.F. GOODRICH PETITIONS
CA HIGH COURT ON IMPROPER
SERVICE OF SUMMONS

     In a petition for review filed Dec. 11 with the California
Supreme Court, B.F. Goodrich Co. contends that it was not
properly served with a summons in an exploding-tire case, and
that the trial court disregarded long-standing case authority in
adopting the "substantial compliance rule" and refusing to quash.
B.F. Goodrich Co. v. CA Super. Ct., Monterey Cty., No. S050529
(CA Sup. Ct.).

     Goodrich says plaintiff Joseph Dinner has conceded that
service was improper in that:

     " Goodrich was not named in the complaint or by amendment;

     " there was no notice pursuant to California Code of Civil
     Procedure Section 412.30;

     " if service was attempted, no designation was made;

               " the summons fails to identify on behalf of whom the person
     who received the summons was served;

     " no date of delivery was noted; and

     " the summons failed to indicate the name and capacity of
     the person who allegedly received service.

     Dinner claims he was injured when a Goodrich tire exploded
while being inflated at a gas station.  He then served what
Goodrich calls an "admittedly defective summons" and complaint on
"The B.F. Goodrich Company," not the named defendant "B.F.
Goodrich."

     The Monterey County Superior Court judge refused to quash
and the state appeals court denied review.  In its petition to
the California Supreme Court, Goodrich argues, "As the law is
clear that 'the substantial compliance rule' does not apply where
the summons fails to identify the individual being served on
behalf of a corporation, the trial court's ruling exceeded its
jurisdiction.  Therefore, based on the evidence before it, the
Superior Court abused its discretion in denying petitioner's
motion to quash."

     Goodrich also argues that with the advent of "fast-track"
rules, courts must guard against any tendency to "move the case
along" at the expense of a potential defendant's rights.  "We
cannot trade these rights for expediency, no matter how noble the
cause may be," the petition states.  "The impact of fast track
rules on trial court rulings (such as here) cannot be minimized.
This case presents clear issues of first impression concerning
adequate service, defective pleading and service, and the effect
of fast track rules on the trial court's interest in moving cases
to trial within the fast track limitation framework even against
entities that are not proper parties."

     Goodrich is represented by David B. Paynter, Paul Ellis
Baron and Valerie L. Leatherwood of Lewis, D'Amato, Brisbois &
Brisgard in San Francisco.

8TH CIR. FINDS LAWN MOWER
DESIGN DEFECT CLAIMS
NOT PREEMPTED BY CPSA

     The Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 27
partially reversed a Minnesota federal court's determinations and
found that a family's design defect claims against a lawnmower
manufacturer were not preempted by the Consumer Product Safety
Act (CPSA).  Moe et al. v. MTD Products Inc., No. 95-1938
(8th Cir.).

     The panel did affirm the defense judgment on the balance of
the plaintiffs' claims, holding the remaining theories of
recovery preempted by the CPSA.

     In July 1992, the fingers of 17-year-old Brian Moe were
amputated when he reached into the side grass chute of a self-
propelled walk-behind mower manufactured by MTD Products Inc.
The mower was equipped with a safety device called a blade
brake/clutch system (BBC), which allows the cutting blade to
rotate only when the control lever of the operator handle is
engaged.  Brian was an experienced operator of the mower, and had
removed grass from the side chute twice on the morning of his
accident without incident.

     It was subsequently discovered that the BBC's control cable
had been broken.  In their action against MTD, Brian's parents
asserted that the mower was defectively designed in that the
control cable was routed in such a manner that it rubbed against
the throttle control housing, causing it to fray and ultimately
break.  In its response, MTD pointed to the fact that in 1991,
the mower's handle had broken from the base, and Thomas Moe had
it reattached by a welder.  The repaired handle was 1-3/8 inches
longer than the original, and MTD claimed that the resultant
increase of stress on the BBC control cable caused its breakage.

     The Moes also alleged that an additional label warning that
the cable may fray should have been placed on the mower's handle.
While the owner's manual advised that the control cable should be
inspected, the plaintiffs asserted that this was insufficient
notice of the potential hazard.  The U.S. District Court for the
District of Minnesota determined that all of the Moes' claims
were preempted by the CPSA.

     On appeal, the Moes contended that their failure to warn and
design defect arguments were not federally preempted.  MTD
conceded that the design defect allegations were not preempted,
but argued that summary judgment in its favor was appropriate
because the product had been substantially altered.

     In its review, the Eighth Circuit noted that the Consumer
Product Safety Commission has promulgated a safety standard for
walk-behind power motors, which provides that a label warning
against blade contact injury must be placed on each mower's blade
housing.  In considering the Moes' contention that a warning that
the BBC cable may fray is required, the court stated that the
"risk of injury contemplated by such a warning is the same as
that addressed by the labelling requirements in the Mower
Standard " injury to the hands by the cutting blade."  The Moes'
claim, the panel wrote, "would create a state standard requiring
additional warnings on lawn mowers or in owners manuals related
to the same risk of injury addressed by the federal standard."

     The panel did find the plaintiffs' design defect claims to
be contemplated by the CPSA's savings clause.  "A successful tort
action based on the defective design of an installed BBC would
not create a different standard for mower safety or impose
different requirements on the manufacturer," the court wrote.

     As to MTD's substantial alteration argument, the court
stated that the "record here shows that issues of material fact
exist as to whether the BBC design caused Brian's injury....
Based on the evidence in the record, it would not be 'sheer
speculation' for a jury in this case to find that the design,
rather than the alteration, caused the fraying and the accident."

MO CT. APP.: CASUAL LENDER
OF NAIL GUN NOT STRICTLY
LIABLE OR NEGLIGENT

     The owner who loaned an allegedly defectively designed nail
gun to someone cannot be held liable on theories of strict
liability or negligence if the user injures somebody, the
Missouri Court of Appeals has ruled.  Bailey v. Innovative
Management & Investment Inc., No. WD 50922 (MO Ct. App.).

     In a unanimous Dec. 19 decision, the panel upheld summary
judgment against a man injured when a nail was accidentally
discharged into his head.

     Innovative Management & Investment loaned a nail gun and
other tools to an employee who was building his own home on his
own time.  Plaintiff Ron Bailey volunteered to help with the
project.  The employee's brother was using the nail gun when
Bailey inadvertently hit the bottom of the device, causing it to
discharge.

     A petition was filed in Boone County Circuit Court alleging
product defect and failure to warn strict liability counts, plus
a claim for negligently furnishing a dangerous instrumentality.
Judge Ellen S. Roper granted the defense motion for summary
judgment.

     The Court of Appeals, Western District, affirmed in an
opinion by Judge James M. Smart Jr.  The panel found no basis for
the strict liability causes of action because Innovative
Management did not inject the nail gun into the stream of
commerce and because the employee did not receive the nail gun
for the mutual benefit of the company and himself.  Innovative
Management supplied the nail gun as an isolated, non-commercial
transaction without financial or other compensation, it said, and
the company was not in the business of selling or furnishing
tools.

     As for the negligence count, the court said the company's
mere furnishing of the nail gun was insufficient to support the
claim because only a gratuitous bailment was involved.
Innovative Management owed Bailey no duty to protect him from
injury because the company received no benefit or advantage from
loaning the instrument to the employee, it said.  The court also
cited uncontradicted testimony that the company president was
unaware of any defect or dangerous condition when the employee
borrowed the nail gun.

     Debbie S. Champion of St. Louis represented Bailey.  Jeffrey
O. Parshall of Columbia represented Innovative Management.

MA CT. REFUSES ROWING MACHINE
SUPPLIER BID FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
ON MARKET SHARE ARGUMENT

     Justice Francis X. Spina of the Berkshire, MA, Superior
Court on Dec. 12 rejected the attempt of a rowing machine
supplier to obtain summary judgment on a seller's third-party
claim for market share liability.  Mahar v. Hanover House
Industries Inc. v. Etna Products et al., No. 88-0156
(MA Super. Ct., Berkshire).

     The judge found the present facts distinguishable from those
in a 1982 diethylstilbestrol (DES) case in which the state high
court declined to adopt the market share liability doctrine for
identifying a liable manufacturer defendant.

     The litigation was brought by David Mahar, who alleged that
he sustained injuries in 1987 while using a rowing exerciser
purchased through the mail from Hanover House Industries.
Hanover brought a third-party complaint against three of its
suppliers; one supplier was later voluntarily dismissed.

     In the two-week period before the product was shipped to
Mahar, Hanover received some 58,199 rowing machines from supplier
E. Mishan & Sons and another 35,686 from Etna Products.  The
machines were indistinguishable as to their supplier, and Hanover
had no inventory control in place that could identify the
supplier of the product Mahar purchased.  Etna sought summary
judgment for failure to identify the actual supplier.

     Justice Spina wrote that "[n]o Massachusetts appellate case
has ever held that a 'market-share' approach may be used to
establish the requisite element of the 'identity' of the
manufacturer or supplier in a product liability case," and noted
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's refusal to do so in
the DES case Payton v. Abbott Labs (1982).

     "Several factors are present in this case which were not
present in Payton," the judge continued, "and factors which
caused the Payton Court concern are not present here."  He noted
that all probable suppliers of the product had been named to the
case; he found that the suppliers "were equally as able as the
defendant to identify the unit shipped, and may still inspect the
unit to try and determine the route of its delivery to the
plaintiff."

               The judge further observed that Etna may still offer proof
that it did not supply the unit in issue, and that both suppliers
may implead the product's manufacturer.  He lastly noted that
"there is no public policy supportive of research and development
of new drugs/medicine impacted here."

     Justice Spina concluded that the dispute was "an appropriate
case to allow a plaintiff to proceed with and develop a theory of
liability which is in the formative stages in this Commonwealth
and which has a reasonably good chance for recognition by the
appellate courts."

EVIDENCE OF SUBSEQUENT
REMEDIAL MEASURES CAN BE
EXCLUDED, 11TH CIR. HOLDS

     The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 18 ruled upon
a matter of first impression and held that evidence of subsequent
remedial measures in strict product liability cases may be
properly excluded under Rule 407 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence.  Wood v. Morbark Industries Inc. et al., No. 93-3472
(11th Cir.).

     The panel did reverse a Florida district judge's denial of
new trial to the plaintiff/appellant, however, determining that
the evidence in issue below had been properly admitted for
impeachment purposes.

     Morbark Industries Inc. had been sued by Ruby Wood, whose
husband, Ginger, died in a 1989 accident involving an "Eeger
Beever" wood chipper of the defendant's manufacture.  Ginger
Wood, a municipal employee, was pulled into the device up to his
upper torso.  In arguing that the product was defective and
unreasonably dangerous, she asserted that the chipper's 17-inch
infeed chute was too short to adequately protect the machine's
operator.

     Morbark was granted a motion in limine to exclude evidence
of post-accident design changes to the chipper that lengthened
the infeed chute.  In its review, the 11th Circuit noted that
defense counsel still "sought to imply to the jury that the
seventeen-inch chute was the safest length chute available and
was still in use by [Ginger's employer] as well as other
government agencies."

     In the course of a 1993 trial in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Florida, plaintiffs' counsel cross-
examined Norvel Morey, Morbark's president and designer of the
Eeger Beever, on the issue of subsequent design changes.  The
trial judge admonished the attorney before the jury, and directed
the jury to disregard any comment concerning the sale of longer
chutes.

               The panel ultimately found for Morbark, determining the
Eeger Beever not to be unreasonably dangerous as designed and
marketed.  Ruby Wood sought new trial, claiming that the trial
judge had committed reversible error by admonishing plaintiff's
counsel before the jury.  In rejecting the motion, the trial
judge found that the admonition had not been unduly prejudicial
to the plaintiff's case.

     In its analysis, the 11th Circuit first rejected Wood's
contention that Rule 407 should not be applied in strict product
liability cases.  "We are persuaded that Rule 407 is necessary in
such cases to focus the jury's attention on the product's
condition or design at the time of the accident," the panel
wrote.  The panel rejected Wood's entreaty to follow the 10th
Circuit's reasoning in Moe v. Avions Marcel (1984), which stated
that federal courts must apply state evidentiary principles if
they conflict with FRE 407.

     Wood next argued that if FRE 407 was deemed controlling,
then the trial court should have applied one of the exceptions to
the rule and held the evidence admissible either to show the
feasibility of precautionary measures, or for impeachment.  Wood
had specifically pointed to Morey's testimony that the 17-inch
chute was the "safest length chute you could possibly put on the
machine."

     The court stated that "[w]hile we do not find that this
testimony put feasibility at issue, we do find that it opened the
door to impeachment....  Wood's counsel should have been allowed
to ask why the supposedly safest design possible was modified
after the accident involving Ginger Wood."

     The panel found that the refusal to allow impeachment of the
witness did not in and of itself substantially affect Wood's
rights, but did have such an impact when considered in
conjunction with the court's direction to the jury.

CA JUDGE DENIES
POST-TRIAL MOTIONS
OF LORILLARD, H&V

     California Superior Court Judge Winton McKibben, without
elaboration, on Nov. 6 denied the motions of Lorillard, Inc. and
Hollingsworth & Vose Co. for a new trial of Milton Horowitz's
suit alleging mesothelioma from asbestos contained in Kent brand
cigarettes.  Horowitz v. Lorillard, Inc. et al., No. 965-245
(CA Super. Ct., San Francisco); see Consumer Product Litigation
Reporter, September 1995.

     Horowitz and his wife, Shirley Horowitz, won jury verdicts
for $2 million against the companies on Aug. 31 after a trial
before Judge McKibben.  The award includes $700,000 in punitive
damages.
               Milton Horowitz, 72, is a retired university professor from
Beverly Hills, CA.  He was still active as a clinical
psychologist when he was diagnosed with mesothelioma in June
1994.  His suit alleges that his cancer was caused by the
asbestos-containing Micronite filters used on Kent cigarettes
between 1952 and 1956.  The suit named Lorillard, Inc. as the
manufacturer of the Kent cigarettes and Hollingsworth & Vose Co.
as the manufacturer of the Micronite filters.

     During the trial, Horowitz claimed that the Kent Micronite
filter was defective and that it rendered the Kent cigarettes
defective by releasing asbestos fibers which he inhaled.  He also
contended that the defendant companies were negligent and failed
to warn about the asbestos health hazard associated with Kent
cigarettes.  He further asserted that the companies
misrepresented the cigarette and filter by claiming that the
filter was "totally harmless" and that the Kent cigarette
"offered the greatest health protection of any cigarette."

     Lorillard and Hollingsworth & Vose defended by arguing that
the filter did not release asbestos fibers.  They also asserted
that Horowitz did not smoke Kent cigarettes in the time period
between 1952 and 1956, when the filter contained asbestos, and
they suggested that he was either mistaken or lying when he said
that he did.

     The jury found for the plaintiffs on all theories of
liability except for the intentional fraud claim " it found that
the defendants made their health representation without knowing
one way or the other whether the filter was "totally harmless."
It awarded $350,000 in economic damages and $700,000 in non-
economic damages to Milton Horowitz, and it awarded $250,000 on a
loss of consortium claim by Shirley Horowitz.  It also found that
Lorillard and Hollingsworth & Vose were each 50% responsible for
the plaintiffs' injuries and damages.

     The jury further determined that Milton Horowitz had
suffered appreciable harm before June 4, 1986, a finding required
by California's Proposition 51, the statute requiring
apportionment of non-economic damages for actions accruing after
June 4, 1986.

     Lastly, the jury found that the plaintiffs had shown by
clear and convincing evidence that each defendant acted with
malice, oppression or fraud, thus entitling the plaintiffs to
punitive damages.

     After a brief supplemental argument, the jury retired on
Aug. 31 to further deliberate the amount, if any, of punitive
damages to award.  It returned with a verdict on Sept. 1,
awarding punitive damages of $560,000 against Lorillard and
$140,000 against Hollingsworth & Vose.

     In its post-trial motion, Hollingsworth & Vose argued that
the court had erred by admitting the deposition testimony of
Elise Comproni, an inspector with the Massachusetts Department of
Labor and Industries, Division of Occupational Hygiene.  Comproni
testified that in 1953 he was "appalled" when he learned that
asbestos was being used in the Kent cigarette filters.
Hollingsworth & Vose argued that he was not qualified to give an
opinion concerning the potential hazards of an asbestos-
containing filter in the early 1950s and that it was prejudiced
by repeated references to the testimony by counsel for the
Horowitzes.

     The filter maker also argued that the weight of the evidence
presented at trial was insufficient to justify the jury's finding
that it had been negligent.  "[P]laintiffs were required to
demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that defendants knew
or should have known of the harmful health effects associated
with an asbestos-containing filter between 1952 and 1956.
Plaintiffs offered no testimony or studies which suggested that
medical science believed such a danger existed during this
period," it asserted.

     Hollingsworth & Vose also contended that it had been
prejudiced by the court decision to allow the jury to consider
fraud claims against it.  The Horowitz complaint, it noted, only
asserted fraud claims against Lorillard, and the plaintiffs
failed to present any evidence of fraud against it.

     Lorillard has prevailed in four previous lawsuits alleging
injury from the filters, largely by raising doubts about whether
the plaintiffs' illness was caused by Kent cigarettes or other
possible exposures to asbestos.  The company is currently
involved in 10 other lawsuits involving the Micronite filters.

     The plaintiffs were represented at trial by Madelyn J.
Chaber with Wartnick, Chaber, Harowitz, Smith & Tigerman in San
Francisco.

     Hollingsworth & Vose is represented by Andrew J.
McElaney Jr., Stephen J. Brake and Daniel R. Harris with Nutter,
McLellan & Fish in Boston and by Donald F. Zimmer Jr. and Cynthia
C. Roenisch with Preuss Walker & Shanagher in San Francisco.
Lorillard is represented by Lewis L. Fenton, Larry E. Hayes and
Ronald F. Scholl with Fenton & Keller of Monterey, CA, and by
David K. Hardy, William S. Ohlemeyer and Mark J. Evans with
Shook, Hardy & Bacon of Kansas City, MO.

LORILLARD, FILTER MAKER
ADDED TO ASBESTOS CASE
IN MICHIGAN

     The plaintiffs in an occupational exposure asbestos case
filed an amended complaint in Michigan state court Dec. 4 to add
Lorillard Inc., Hollingsworth & Vose Co. and Macco Chemical Co.
as defendants in their personal injury product liability suit.
Sorise et al. v. 20th Century Glove Corp. of Texas et al.,
No. 95-521238 NP (MI Cir. Ct., Wayne Cty.).

     The amended complaint filed in Wayne County Circuit Court
named the additional defendants because the lead plaintiff smoked
Kent cigarettes with "Micronite" filters in the 1950s.  In the
original July 25, 1995 complaint, retired tile setter Nelson
Sorise alleged his mesothelioma resulted from on-the-job exposure
to a variety of asbestos products.  Nearly 60 defendants were
named.

     The amendment added the three Kent defendants, alleging that
asbestos fibers in Micronite filters were also a proximate cause
of Sorise's mesothelioma.  According to the complaint, which
alleged failure to warn, Sorise smoked Kents between 1952 and
1956, the time when Micronite filters were used.

     According to Sorise's attorney, Michael B. Serling of
Birmingham, MI, Kents were marketed heavily as being safer than
their competitors on the basis that the Micronite filters removed
tar and nicotine.

     Kent's Micronite filters have been the focus of two recent
actions, one of which ended in a $2 million award in favor of a
California professor who alleged mesothelioma from the asbestos
in the Micronite filters (Horowitz v. Lorillard, Inc. et al.,
No. 964-245 [CA Super. Ct.]; see story this issue).  In the
other, a federal court jury in Chicago returned a defense verdict
in a suit brought by the family of an Encyclopedia Britannica
executive who died from cancer allegedly caused by the asbestos
in the filters (Braun v. Lorillard Inc. et al., No. 94-C-976
[ND IL]; see Consumer Product Litigation Reporter, December 1995,
P. 5,285).

     The Sorise case has been assigned to Judge Robert J.
Colombo Jr.

FORMER CIGARETTE MODEL,
10 OTHERS SUE CIGARETTE
MAKERS, SELLERS IN FL

     A former Winston cigarette model and 10 other people filed a
products liability suit against tobacco companies and cigarette
sellers Dec. 11 in Florida state court, alleging injury from
cigarette smoking.  Levine et al. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. et
al., No. CL 95-9806-AH, (FL Cir. Ct., 15th Jud. Cir., Palm Beach
Cty.).

     Lead plaintiff Alan Landers, also known as Allan Levine,
worked as a model in Winston print advertisements in the 1960s.
He has undergone two surgeries for lung cancer that he attributes
to smoking cigarettes.
               The complaint stated that the defendants' tobacco products,
when used as intended, were highly likely to cause, or contribute
in substantial fashion, to illness and injuries, including
bronchogenic carcinoma, chronic bronchitis, cardiovascular
disease and other conditions.

     "So likely were the serious health consequences of
defendants' tobacco products that over one in three foreseeable
users would be expected to suffer premature death or serious
impairment," the complaint said.  Further, the plaintiffs
maintained, tobacco products, when used as intended, "were highly
likely to induce in foreseeable users a state of addiction."

     The complaint contains counts of negligence, strict
liability and civil conspiracy.

     The plaintiffs claim that the tobacco firms had a duty to
design a safe product, but sold the cigarettes in their current
form knowing that they would probably cause disease and
addiction.

     Named defendants are R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., American Tobacco Co., Philip Morris
Inc., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc., United States
Tobacco Sales & Marketing Co. Inc., Culbro Corp. (formerly known
as General Cigar Co. Inc.), and retailers ABC Liquors Inc.,
Publix Supermarkets Inc. and Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc.

     The plaintiffs are represented by Tracy E. Tomlin and
Michael T. Tomlin of Otero, Mullin & Tomlin of Coral Gables, FL,
and by Norwood S. Wilner of Spohrer, Wilner & Maxwell of
Jacksonville, FL.

KS SMOKELESS TOBACCO
CASE WITHDRAWN; NATIONAL
CLASS SUIT TO FOLLOW

     A lawsuit filed on behalf of Kansas residents against the
makers of smokeless tobacco products was withdrawn Dec. 18 by
attorneys who filed the suit because they plan to refile on
behalf of a nationwide class of smokeless tobacco users.  Hammers
v. United States Tobacco Co., No. 95-1335-MLB (D KS); see
Consumer Product Litigation Reporter, August 1995.

     The lawsuit was filed July 24 in U.S. District Court for the
District of Kansas, in Wichita, alleging that the manufacturers
of smokeless tobacco products have designed sales campaigns that
specifically set out to lure users of their products to
"graduate" to products containing higher concentrations of
nicotine.

     The complaint was filed on behalf of all users of smokeless
tobacco products in Kansas.  The plaintiffs were seeking class
action status and had the potential of involving approximately
30,000 Kansas residents.

     Plaintiff attorney Derek Casey of Hutton & Hutton in Wichita
said he expected to file a new lawsuit on behalf of a nationwide
class by mid-February.

     The suit named as defendants United States Tobacco Co.,
Pinkerton Tobacco Co., Conwood Co., L.P., Helme Tobacco Co.,
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., The Smokeless Tobacco Council,
Inc., The Smokeless Tobacco Research Council, Inc., The Tobacco
Institute Inc. and The Council for Tobacco Research, Inc.

     The smokeless tobacco industry has been free from litigation
during a time when lawsuits against cigarette manufacturers have
been filed across the country.  In 1989, the 10th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals upheld a 1986 jury verdict that the evidence in
a case brought by the family of an Oklahoma teenager had failed
to show conclusively that the manufacturer's smokeless tobacco
was the cause of the teenager's death (Marsee v. United States
Tobacco Co., No. 86-2094 [10th Cir.]).

     The Marsee case turned on causation rather than addiction,
which was the basis for the Kansas lawsuit.

D MA DISMISSES MERCURY
POISONING SUIT AGAINST
TUNA CANNER ON CAUSATION

     A U.S. District Court judge sitting in Boston granted
summary judgment dismissing a personal injury complaint against a
tuna fish canning company on Nov. 30, because he concluded that
no genuine issue of any material fact would permit a jury to find
either that the plaintiff suffers from mercury poisoning or that
the cannery's product was the cause of any such poisoning.  Kern
v. Nozaki America Inc., No. 94-12272-RGS (D MA).

     Alice Kern filed a personal injury suit in 1994 alleging
negligence and breach of warranty.  She claimed that she
contracted mercury poisoning from eating five to seven cans of
Geisha brand canned tuna per week for 24 years.  Geisha brand is
sold by defendant Nozaki America Inc., which moved for summary
judgment.

     U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns found that while
there is no question that Kern is ill, the only disease that she
has been diagnosed as having is rheumatoid arthritis.  Her doctor
tested her blood for mercury in 1991 and found her mercury blood
level to be slightly above normal.  It returned to the mid-range
of normal after Kern stopped eating Geisha tuna and underwent
chelation therapy, Judge Stearns said.

     To prevail in her suit, Kern would have had to establish
that eating the amounts of tuna she claims to have ingested can
cause mercury poisoning and that Geisha brand tuna contains
mercury at levels sufficient to have caused the poisoning.  Judge
Stearns found that she could establish neither.

     "Viewing all inferences in the light most favorable to Kern,
there are no disputed facts in the record that would permit a
jury to find that Kern suffers from mercury poisoning, much less
that any such poisoning resulted from her consumption of Geisha
brand tuna," he said.

CIBA ARGUES CONTACT SOLUTION
NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS ARE
PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW

     Approved labels and warnings on medical devices are
"specific requirements" of federal law that preempt causes of
action brought under state law, respondent Ciba Vision Corp.
argued in its answer to a petition filed by a California woman
asking the state Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's ruling
that all of her claims against Ciba are preempted by the Medical
Devices Amendments.  Scott v. Ciba Vision Corp., No. S049608
(CA Sup. Ct.); see Consumer Product Litigation Reporter, December
1995.

     In its Nov. 15 answer, Ciba contended that the California
Court of Appeal, Sixth District, was aligned with a majority of
jurisdictions that have held that federal law preempts causes of
action brought under state law.

     Appellant Leslie Scott brought suit in California state
court against Ciba, alleging claims of strict liability,
negligence, failure to provide adequate warnings and breach of
implied warranty.  Scott claimed she had difficulty in
distinguishing Ciba's AOSEPT solution, which contains hydrogen
peroxide, from its saline solution.  She claimed that as a result
of her failure to distinguish between the bottles, she suffered
chemical burns to her eyes when she rinsed her contacts in the
AOSEPT solution instead of the saline solution.

     Scott argued that, around the time of her injury, Ciba had
begun to market its AOSEPT solution with a red cap, but also
continued to market it in the old bottle, knowing that persons
not wearing their contacts would have difficulty in
distinguishing the two.

     The Santa Clara County Superior Court granted Ciba's motion
for summary judgment, finding Scott's claims preempted by the
MDA.  On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Sixth District,
affirmed the trial court.

     The Court of Appeal cited to Evraets v. Intermedics
Intraocular, Inc., 29 Cal.App.4th 786, and 21 C.F.R. Section
808.1(b), in holding that the "requirement" the Food and Drug
Administration refers to in Section 360k includes "any
requirement having the force and effect of law 'whether
established by statute, ordinance, regulation, or court
decision.'"

     Examining Scott's argument that the MDA contains no specific
counterpart regulations regarding AOSEPT, the Court of Appeal
held that all Class III medical devices are subject to the
requirements of the MDA, which include the FDA's stringent
premarket approval process.

     In her petition to the California Supreme Court, Scott
argued that the only other state Supreme Court that has addressed
the issue of federal preemption concerning Class III devices
found that the plaintiff's claims were not preempted (Larsen v.
Pacesetter Systems, Inc. [Hawaii 1992], 837 P.2d 1273, 1281).

     Some of the leading cases that have expounded on the issue
of preemption have recently been criticized, Scott said.  For
example, the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' 1984 ruling in
Martello v. Ciba Vision Corp. gave Section 360k(a), the MDA's
preemption provision, an expansive reading, but was criticized in
the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Kennedy, Scott said.  "The...Ninth
Circuit in Kennedy...stated that the language of Section 360k(a)
does not create the broad, sweeping preemption found by the
'strained reading of the statute' by the court in Martello,"
Scott argued.

     And, Scott said, state actions that attempt to enforce
federal standards are not preempted.  Citing to Evraets, the
appellant said, regarding a claim of negligence per se, since the
state requirements are equal to the federal requirements because
they adopt the federal standards, they are not preempted.

     On the other hand, Ciba argued in its answer that a
consistent line of cases holds that state law tort and warranty
causes of action are preempted because the pre-market approval
process envelops the approved product in specific requirements of
federal law.

     "Scott makes no claim of any defect in the design or
manufacture of AOSEPT," Ciba said.  "Rather, she contends that
California tort and warranty law required that Ciba Vision
package and label AOSEPT differently in order to warn users
against accidental placement of deneutralized solution in the
eye."

     Ciba argued that this is a "strong case for MDA preemption"
because of AOSEPT's premarket approval and Scott's singular focus
on warning deficiencies in the product.

     The respondent said that the court's decision in Evraets,
which Scott cited in her petition, does not warrant review by the
state Supreme Court.  Ciba said Evraets does not deal with a
device that received FDA premarket approval.

     "Evraets contains a discussion of the preemption of state
law claims for breach of warranty that is consistent with the
decision in Scott," Ciba said.  "Evraets only reaches the issue
of preemption in relation to a claim of breach of an express
warranty."

     Ciba concluded that by enacting the MDA, Congress interposed
the FDA as an expert watchdog and preempted certain state law
causes of action.  A jury should not be allowed to rethink the
sufficiency of labels and packaging that the FDA endorsed, said
Ciba.

     In her Nov. 27 reply, Scott said the Court of Appeal cited
two cases in its decision that are not relevant to this case.  In
Evraets and Powers v. Optical Radiation Corp. (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 1444, the cases involved experimental products for
which adequate warnings were not yet known, Scott said.

     Ciba's statements that this case is a "pure label and
warning case" and that Scott "makes no claim for any defect in
the design" are disingenuous and completely inaccurate, Scott
argued.

     "Respondent is well aware that Leslie Scott claims that the
design of the two virtually indistinguishable white product
containers containing harmful and harmless ingredients
respectively are defective under both negligence and strict
liability theories," she stated.

     Scott is represented by Jonathan D. Gordon of the Law
Offices of Jonathan D. Gordon in Denver.  Ciba is represented by
Thomas M. Peterson and Diane S. Rice of Brobeck, Phleger &
Harrison in San Francisco.

PA SUP. CT.: LANDLORDS
HAVE NO DUTY TO INSPECT
FOR LEAD PAINT HAZARDS

     The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Nov. 22 reaffirmed a 27-
year-old ruling that landlords cannot be held to have
constructive notice of the dangers of lead paint to young
children occupying their premises and, therefore, that they have
no duty to test for and remove lead paint from their properties.
Felton v. Spratley et al., No. 7 East. Dist. App. Dkt. (PA
Sup. Ct.).

     The one-page per curiam decision stated that the appeal is
dismissed "as having been improvidently granted," with Justice
John P. Flaherty dissenting.  It offers no further commentary nor
is Justice Flaherty's dissent explained.
               Lucretia Felton and her daughter, Shakeema, petitioned for
rehearing on Dec. 6, and a ruling on that request is still
pending.  Their attorney, Edwin L. London of Matkoff & Shengold,
said he was "terribly disappointed" by the dismissal, especially
since the lower court ruling was a 2-1 split decision, and since
the Supreme Court had been briefed and had heard oral arguments
in October.

     The Supreme Court's dismissal lets stand a ruling affirming
the dismissal of this suit by the trial court on the grounds that
the landlord had no actual notice of the lead paint hazards in
the apartment she rented to the Feltons.

     The Feltons resided in an apartment leased from Marie
Spratley in 1988; Shakeema was diagnosed with lead poisoning the
following year.  When Spratley was notified of the chipping and
peeling lead paint by the Philadelphia Health Department, she had
the paint removed and the apartment repainted within a month.

     The Feltons then filed suit in the Philadelphia County Court
of Common Pleas, alleging negligence and carelessness in failing
to test for and remove the paint prior to Shakeema's poisoning
around May 1989.

     The trial court granted summary judgment to Jessie and
Mollucye Spratley Pearson, the executors of Marie Spratley's
estate, based on the grounds that Spratley was unaware of the
hazardous condition and, therefore, had no obligation to correct
it.  The defendants had argued that Lucretia Felton was aware of
the peeling paint for several months before Shakeema was
diagnosed, but never reported it to them.

     On appeal to state Superior Court, the Feltons conceded that
the defendants lacked actual knowledge of the presence of lead
paint in the apartment, but, they contended, knowledge about lead
paint poisoning had become widespread among the public by the
late 1980s and, therefore, Spratley should have had constructive
knowledge of the hazard and should have eliminated it.

     The Superior Court panel ruled 2-1 that it remained bound by
the state Supreme Court's holding in Kolojeski v. Deisher Inc.,
429, Pa. 191, 239 A.2d 329 (1968), which stated that where the
landlord had no notice that the walls were painted with lead
paint until after the plaintiffs had been treated for lead
poisoning, he had no affirmative duty to inspect the premises for
lead paint and he could not be held liable for the injuries.

     The Feltons argued that public knowledge of lead paint
hazards had increased substantially since 1968 when Kolojeski was
decided and, therefore, that the defendants should be held to
have had constructive notice of the dangers of lead paint.  The
Superior Court majority ruled that the Feltons failed to cite any
state law case or to otherwise persuade it to expand the law of
negligence between landlord and tenant.
               In a New York case in May, a five-judge appellate court
panel ruled that New York City's landlords do have an affirmative
duty to search out and remove lead paint in apartments occupied
by children, but that ruling was based on a city ordinance that
explicitly spells out that duty.  In October, the Residential
Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Title X) went into
effect.  That federal law requires landlords throughout the
country to inform potential tenants of the presence of lead paint
in rental properties or to abate the hazard if the tenants
include young children.

     In addition to London, the Feltons are represented by Meryl
Cohen of Matkoff & Shengold in Philadelphia.  Spratley is
represented by Josh M. Greenbaum of Cozen & O'Connor, also in
Philadelphia.

1ST CIR: INSURANCE CO.
FAILS TO PROVE LANDLORD
INSURED FOR KNOWN RISK

     A landlord who knew his apartments were contaminated with
lead paint is still entitled to indemnification from his insurer
because the insurance company failed to show that when the
landlord took out the policy, he either knew the lead paint in
his building was the source of a tenant's lead poisoning or knew
that she would suffer further injury after the effective date of
the policy, according to a Nov. 28 ruling by the First Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals.  United States Liability Insurance Co. v.
Selman et al., No. 95-1435 (1st Cir.).

     Livingstone Selman owns an apartment house in Roxbury, MA,
where Robin Razza and her infant daughter, Carol Ann, resided.
Carol Ann was diagnosed with lead poisoning late in 1984.  Selman
began removing the lead paint on March 7, 1985, and by March 29,
an inspection of the Razzas' apartment showed it to be 95% lead-
free.

     In May 1985, Selman changed insurance carriers and insured
the apartment house with United States Liability Insurance Co.
(USLIC).  The insurance company renewed the policy in May 1986.
The Razzas moved from Selman's apartment building in September
1986 and subsequently brought a state law personal injury suit
against Selman that is still pending.

     USLIC, attempting to escape liability, brought a diversity
action seeking a declaratory judgment in U.S. District Court for
the District of Massachusetts.  After a bench trial, the district
court ruled that USLIC had no duty to indemnify Selman for claims
for injuries resulting from Carol Ann's ingestion of lead paint
prior to May 4, 1985 (the inception date of the first policy).
However, the court ruled, USLIC does have a duty to indemnify
Selman with respect to claims arising while the policies were in
effect " from May 4, 1985, to May 3, 1987.
               On appeal, USLIC advanced three alternative grounds for
reversing the district court judgment:  (1) coverage was never
triggered because Carol Ann sustained no discernible injuries
while the insurance policies were in effect; (2) Carol Ann's
injuries were the result of her initial ingestion of lead paint
before the policies went into effect; and (3) Selman knew about
the liability before the policies went into effect and,
therefore, is precluded from coverage under the "known risk"
doctrine.

     Circuit Judge Bruce M. Selya, writing for a unanimous
appellate panel, ruled first that the appeal had to be decided on
the "clear error" standard because the issues revolved around the
interpretation of substantial extrinsic evidence and not solely
on questions about the clear meaning of contract provisions.

     The district court was correct in determining that coverage
had been triggered because Razza's expert witness, Dr. John
Graef, testified that "at least a portion" of Carol Ann's claimed
injuries occurred during the policy periods, the appellate court
found.  Graef's testimony was supported by data showing sharp
increases, or "spikes," in Carol Ann's blood toxicity levels
corresponding to incidents of lead paint ingestion during the
policy period.

     Further, Graef testified that the new incidents of lead
paint ingestion resulted in further injuries that occurred during
the period covered by the policies because, unlike many other
diseases such as measles or chicken pox, lead poisoning injuries
are cumulative, the circuit court ruled.

     "[T]he district court had before it compelling evidence that
Carol Ann Razza ingested several 'big meals' of lead paint chips
while the appellant's policies were in force, and Dr. Graef
testified that each such ingestion caused (or potentially could
cause) discrete injury.  On this basis, the district court
warrantably found a clear nexus between Carol Ann's 'big meals'
and the spikes in her toxicity levels," Judge Selya wrote.

     On the issue of known risk, Judge Selya said, the central
question on appeal is:  "What did Selman know and when did he
know it?"  The known risk doctrine precludes coverage when the
insured knows in advance of the policy's effective date that a
specific loss has already happened or is substantially certain to
happen.

     "[T]he presence of risk runs to the very essence of an
insurance contract.  Where there is no risk of loss " as where a
loss has already occurred before a policy takes effect "
insurance ceases to serve its socially utile purpose of risk-
spreading," he said.

     Finding that the test for asserting the known risk doctrine
is subjective and that the insurer has the burden of proof, the
First Circuit ruled that nothing in the court record showed that
the lead paint in Selman's building was the source of Carol Ann's
illness (or that he knew of the connection), nor that Selman knew
that Carol Ann would suffer further injury from continued
exposure to lead paint.  Further, the panel said, given the
inspection report that the Razza apartment was 95% free of lead
six weeks before the first policy became effective, Selman could
easily have assumed that Carol Ann was no longer exposed to any
significant amount of lead paint and therefore would suffer no
further injury.

     "The district court's finding is strengthened by the utter
lack of any evidence that Selman attempted to conceal or
misrepresent the presence of lead paint in his apartment house
when he applied for insurance.  To the extent that the
appellant's application form did not request such information,
the appellant was the author of its own misfortune," Judge Selya
wrote.

     Finally, the panel ruled, the district court did not commit
reversible error in declining to interpret a clause in the policy
limiting the company's liability to $300,000 per occurrence as
meaning that USLIC's total potential liability is capped at
$300,000.  While the district court did not spell out its
reasoning, it seems self-evident that the basis for the ruling
was that the policy does not define the operative terms of that
clause, Judge Selya concluded.

     USLIC was represented by Alice Olsen Mann and Mark P. Bailey
of Morrison, Mahoney & Miller.  Selman was represented by Kenneth
H. Soble of Soble, Van Dam, Pearlman & Gittelsohn.  Clyde D.
Bergstresser and Angela M. Vieira of Bergstresser & Associates
represented Razza.  All are Boston firms.

HANDBOOK URGES JAPANESE COMPANIES TO GET INVOLVED

     Corporate giving and volunteerism are significant elements
of life in the United States that the Japanese community must
come to terms with, says a handbook published by New York's
Japanese Chamber of Commerce.
     Published with Japanese and English text on facing pages,
the book is titled Joining In! A Handbook for Better Corporate
Citizenship in the United States.  Its 85 pages contain advice to
Japan-based companies in America on how to participate
effectively in communities where they have built plants, by
supporting local charities and volunteering to work for local
organizations.
     In the preface, Hisao Kondo, president of the Japanese
Chamber of Commerce, emphasizes that Joining In! was not written
just to expand Japanese understanding of American philanthropy,
but as a "call to action."  As such, it urges Japanese executives
in the United States to take the initiative in getting involved
in their communities without waiting to be asked.
     "This is a vital means of gaining acceptance and thereby
improving American community perception of the Japanese
transplant company," says the handbook.  It emphasizes that
community involvement can promote a Japanese corporation's
business interests in several ways:
     o  by improving its ability to recruit and retain skilled
local employees;

     o  by fostering good working relationships with local and
state government officials;

     o  by providing tax deductions; and

     o  by improving the company's image.
     Language and cultural barriers have prevented many Japanese
executives from joining boards and volunteering for other
community activities, according to the handbook.  One result of
this is that some Japanese-based corporations have suffered from
the image of being uninvolved.
     To change this perception, the handbook recommends that
Japanese corporations take a number of steps toward becoming more
involved in their local communities:

     o  Establish a company policy on volunteering and community
involvement, after first seeking suggestions from all employees.

     o  Create a program budget.

     o  Appoint a community involvement coordinator who, ideally,
should be Japanese; alternatively, a Japanese and an American
could be joint coordinators.

     o  Select an initial project for special attention and
publicize it in the company and community.

     o  Recognize and reward volunteerism by employees.
     "Volunteer programs are a way for corporations to
demonstrate moral leadership, `doing the right thing,' which
comes back to benefit the company by enhancing its image and its
influence in the community," says the handbook.  "Community
involvement and volunteer programs are ultimately good for
business."
     Next month CGW will look at areas in the United States where
Japanese companies have a strong presence for an overview of
their giving policies.
     Joining In! is available for $40 from the Japanese Chamber
of Commerce and Industry of New York, The Galleria, 115 East 57th
Street, New York, NY 10022.

REEBOK TAKES STEPS TO COMBAT RACISM

     Three recent grants by the Reebok Foundation illustrate the
athletic shoe manufacturer's long-term commitment to human
rights.
     The largest gift, $750,000, went to the Center for the Study
of Sport in Society at Northeastern University, Boston, MA, for a
program to combat racism.
     The three-year program, called "Project Teamwork," plans to
send teams of athletes to schools and community groups around the
country, starting this summer.  Four cities, Boston, Los Angeles,
New York, and Washington, DC, will be targeted in the first year.
     The founders of the project say it is necessary because they
feel civil rights progress has slowed and that racism and
anti-Semitism are on the rise.  They believe athletes are key to
the program's success because athletes are among the strongest
black role models.
     Project Teamwork will also include elements of a program
started five years ago to help former college athletes who failed
to get their degrees after their athletic eligibility expired.
  In the schools and community centers they visit, the
athletes will talk about the dangers of racism, the value of
staying in school, and the fallacy of going through school with
the idea of making a career of professional athletics.
     Reebok also announced a $375,000 grant to TransAfrica, as
part of a campaign to discredit rumors that Reebok International
does business in South Africa.  (Reebok stopped selling its
products in South Africa in 1976.)
     The grant will help build TransAfricare's new library and
research center in Washington, DC.  When completed, the center
will be the primary resource for historical and educational
materials on the role of African Americans in the shaping of U.S.
foreign policy.
     A third grant, for $50,000, went to the NAACP for the
general fund of the civil rights group.
     The grants exemplify Reebok's long-term commitment to the
cause of human rights, says Paul Fireman, chairman and CEO of the
company.  The foundation is also interested in supporting "the
underserved" children and youth, the handicapped, and the
elderly.  It also occasionally assists capital campaigns or
building projects "where the result would make a world of
difference in the lifestyle of the people served," according to
foundation guidelines.
     Reebok's total contributions in 1987 were $285,500,
increasing to $1.5 million in 1988.  The foundation accepts
proposals year-round; the contact person is Jean Mahoney,
executive director, Reebok Foundation, 150 Royall Street, Canton,
MA 02021, (617) 341-7361.

     Look for possible enhancement of Dayton Hudson's charitable

     Look for possible enhancement of Dayton Hudson's charitable
giving policies since the corporation's $1.04 billion acquisition
of Marshall Field's, announced in April.  Marshall Field's 24
stores, located in Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas, and Ohio, will
bring Dayton Hudson's total number of department stores to 61.
It is too soon to speculate on changes in corporate giving, a
Dayton Hudson spokesman said, "but if the merger is successful,
Marshall Field's will become a part of our culture, and the
foundation is a big part of that culture."  The Dayton Hudson
Foundation gave $17.4 million in 1988, chiefly to the arts and
humanities and social services.  Cynthia Mayeda was recently
named director of the foundation (CGW, April).

     According to a new independent survey commissioned by Save
the Children, 84% of all heads of companies polled feel that
children's education is a world problem of extreme or great
importance, even more than pollution, energy shortages, and
disease.  More than half (58%) of the business executives polled
think that corporations should participate in charity-sponsored
efforts to help disadvantaged children worldwide.  According to
the survey findings, the three most important factors when
considering a corporate contribution to a charity are geographic
areas served, cited by 77%; concrete results, cited by 76%; and
the percentage of revenues spent on administration, cited by 69%.

PRUDENTIAL FUNDS HEALTH CARE FOR URBAN YOUTH

     In response to health care delivery gaps and high infant
mortality rates in its corporate office host city of Newark, NJ,
the Prudential Foundation will fund two initiatives that will
increase access to medical and social programs for the city's
children.
     The school-based initiative, "Cities in Schools," (CIS) will
offer an array of on-site social services to 135 students who
attend Newark's Central High School, where the dropout rate is 22
percent. Services will include medical and dental care, pre- and
post-natal care, academic counseling, and job training.
     CIS, which received $100,000 from the Prudential Foundation,
is supported nationally by private-sector funding and the federal
Justice, Labor, and Health and Human Services departments. If
successful, the program may be replicated in Newark's four other
high schools.
     The foundation also gave the University of Medicine and
Dentistry of New Jersey $65,000 to support a mobile pediatric
health clinic that will make house calls to children in Newark's
low-income housing projects. About 100 children a week will visit
the unit.
     The two grants are among $4.5 million the foundation
allocated to health care and education programs in 1990.
     "The projects are classic examples of how addressing the
needs of particular populations and communities can have larger
implications for society and business," said Prudential
Foundation president Peter Goldberg.

THE PRUDENTIAL: HOW MUCH THEY GIVE, WHERE IT GOES

     The Foundation gave $14.3 million in 1989 and $13.34 million
in 1989.  The company's direct giving in 1988 totaled about $1.74
million, which does not include non-monetary support of $252,000.
     Primary concerns are improving basic education skills,
including math, science, language arts, and computer literacy in
public schools, and supporting increased educational
opportunities for the disadvantaged, minorities, women, and
disabled people.  Health care is also a priority.
     A number of education contributions are disbursed as
employee matching gifts to colleges and universities, private
secondary schools, and schools for people with disabilities.
Contact: Elisa D. Pazzuoli, Secretary, Prudential
Foundation, Prudential Plaza, 745 Broad Street, 15th Floor,
Newark, NJ 07101.  Requests for nonmonetary support should be
addressed to William E. Brooks, Vice President, Community
Relations.

D.C. SCHOOL BOARD ACCEPTS $1 MILLION FROM PHILIP MORRIS

     The Washington, DC, school board recently approved a $1
million grant from the Philip Morris tobacco conglomerate,
overturning its original decision to delay acceptance of the
money because of "moral" concerns.
     The uncertainty about whether or not to accept the grant
highlights the concerns that school systems in cities with large
minority populations have in accepting gifts from tobacco
companies.  There is growing anger locally about industry tactics
to promote a product linked to about 900 deaths a year in the
District, a rate that far exceeds the national average.
     But company officials say the criticism would be worse and
more deserved if they failed to share their wealth.  "If we gave
$1 million to Mother Teresa, critics would find something wrong
with it," said Tom Ricke, Philip Morris spokesman.  "We do it
because it's the right thing to do."
     The grant will help finance learning centers at several city
schools chosen as sites for a school-improvement model created by
Yale University child psychiatrist James P. Comer.

CORPORATE SUPPORT OF READING PROGRAMS EXPANDS

     Encouraging children to read is one of corporate America's
favorite ways of disbursing charitable funds.  There is a double
payoff: reading programs address companies' own needs for
literate employees and also enhance their public image.
     Jello Desserts, a division of General Foods Corporation,
which began its Reading Rocket program two years ago in ten city
school systems, will offer the program nationally in 1990-91.
 Launched with a grant of $2.5 million, Reading Rocket is aimed
at children in grades 2-4 and addresses three major
concerns: motivating children to enjoy reading, encouraging
parental participation, and providing teachers and librarians
with additional books.
     Another successful program, Pizza Hut's "Book It!" was
started five years ago to encourage children in grades 1-6 to
read more by rewarding them with pizza vouchers.  This program
has proved so popular that in 1990-91 it will be offered to
children in kindergarten, too.  Because many kindergartners
cannot read, teachers will set reading goals that involve
parents, grandparents, and siblings in reading to the child.
Steven S. Reinemund, president and CEO of Pizza Hut, a division
of Pepsico, explains his company's motivation for the project:
"As an employer, we believe an investment in education is an
investment in our future."
     Currently the company's annual budget for literacy
initiatives is $20 million.
     Contact: Eunice Ellis, Pizza Hut, Inc., P.O. Box 2999,
Wichita, KS 67201.
     Early childhood education is also a priority of the General
Foods Corporation, which merged with Kraft in 1988.  Before the
merger, General Foods gave about $10 million annually.  Contact:
Ronald J. Coman, administrative director, Kraft General Foods
Foundation, Glenview, IL 60025.

CAUSE-RELATED MARKETING: SIX TIPS FOR SUCCESS

     The word is out that corporations can sell products, make
money, and do good at the same time through a well thought out
cause-marketing campaign, William H. Lembeck, president of Ryan
Cause Marketing, a consulting company in Westport, CT, told an
international conference of the National Society of Fund Raising
Executives in Orlando, FL, in March.
     But a lot of nonprofit organizations don't understand the
needs of corporations or how they go about marketing their
products, and therefore miss out on this "huge pot of money,"
Lembeck noted.
     Here are Lembeck's six tips for nonprofits who want to reap
the benefits of cause-related marketing:

     o  Think like a marketer.  Identify your organization's
marketable assets.  These may include your name, community
awareness of your programs, and your board members.

     o  Learn as much as you can about the companies you wish to
approach.  Read the business press; check the companies' annual
reports; watch their ads and promotions.

     o  Try to figure out what their target is before you
approach them.

     o  Address their needs in your presentation; show them that
you're on their side and that working with your organization will
help them sell more products (and incidentally benefit your
cause).

     o  Identify key decision makers.  For cause-marketing
decisions, the person to approach is not the head of the
foundation, it's the vice president of marketing and sales.
o  Follow up a proposal personally by phone and in letters until
you get an answer.

     At its April board meeting, AT&T share-holders
overwhelmingly turned down a proposal that sought to ban
corporate funding for organizations endorsing abortion.  The vote
followed the AT&T Foundation's decision to cut off donations to
Planned Parenthood because of complaints from anti-abortionists.
In a letter to Robert E. Allen, chairman of the board and CEO of
AT&T, Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood, said that
the company's actions, "have damaged corporate philanthropy in
general.  You have demonstrated that a small band of zealots can
successfully harass a major corporation."  Wattleton's letter,
written before the shareholders' meeting, pointed out that AT&T
management advised share-holders to vote against the proposal,
"an enlightened position now undercut by the foundation."

     Earth Day organizers raised about $2.5 million to celebrate

     Earth Day organizers raised about $2.5 million to celebrate
its 20th anniversary in April.  Among corporate donors that met
Earth Day's strict environmental standards were Esprit clothing
company; Shaklee, which manufactures biodegradable and
phosphate-free detergents; and Church & Dwight, which makes Arm &
Hammer products.  Organizers say they turned away $4 million from
corporations that did not meet their exacting standards.  But
being rejected as sponsors of Earth Day has not prevented
companies such as GM, AT&T, Mobil, Shell Oil, and Dow Chemical
from latching onto the environment as a marketing gimmick in
their advertising.  Ad executives predict consumer backlash.
The Soviet national airline, Aeroflot, has agreed to buy jet
engines from General Electric Co., the first time Western-made
commercial aircraft engines have been sold to the Soviet Union.
GE said the sale could be worth as much as $150 million and opens
the door to further sales to the Soviet airline, the world's
largest.  The purchase comes on top of $131 million in orders
from state-owned airlines in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and
Poland.

BURGER KING COOKS UP WAYS TO HELP KIDS STAY IN SCHOOL

     To help combat the nation's chronic school dropout rate,
Burger King has opened Burger King Academies in seven cities;
three more will be announced in September.
     The academies, run by the dropout-prevention organization
Cities in Schools, offer academic instruction to dropout-prone
high school students, along with counseling, job training, and
access to social services such as child care and public
assistance.
     The U.S. Department of Justice helped launch the project
with a $1 million grant.  Burger King added $350,000 seed money,
plus $45,000 a year per academy for budget expenses.
     Academies are located in Long Beach, Inglewood, and
Sacramento, CA; San Antonio, TX; Palm Beach and Miami, FL; and
Philadelphia, PA.

FUNDING CHANGES EXPECTED AT PEW AFTER REORGANIZATION

     The Pew Charitable Trusts, Philadelphia, PA, recently
concluded a major organizational restructuring in an effort to
respond to increases in the foundation's assets and grant making
that occurred during the 1980s.  In 1990, with assets that now
exceed $3.2 billion, the foundation expects to make grants
totaling roughly $145 million.  Along with the expanded grant
making will come a program that emphasizes increased foundation
involvement with grantees as well as with other grant makers and
a stronger commitment to interdisciplinary funding.  Here is a
program-by-program look at some of the changes at the foundation.
     Health and human services.  According to Drew E. Altman, who
now heads Pew's health and human services program, "A natural
role for foundations is to provide the seed funds for [health and
human services] programs that ultimately get picked up and
integrated into government funding streams."  In addition to a
closer collaboration with the government, Altman predicts more
partnerships with other foundations.  While Altman says he
expects the process of developing a new agenda for the foundation
to take several years, he is certain that the problems of
children living in poverty will be "a top concern."
     Education.  Pew's new program director for education, Robert
B. Schwartz, believes there is potential for increased
partnerships between the government, the corporate sector, and
foundations in education, with foundations providing the "initial
risk capital to test innovative programs."  While higher
education will continue to be a primary focus of the trusts,
Schwartz expects to direct increased attention toward
intervention programs that will focus on the middle-school years.
     According to Schwartz, the foundation will encourage
educators who are taking a broader view of their role, one which
cuts across traditional service lines and includes
responsibilities such as nutrition and health care.  Schwartz is
also interested in exploring the role of private philanthropy in
encouraging a more centralized national educational agenda.
     Culture.  Marian A Godfrey, the foundation's new program
director for culture, says she "would like to explore
partnerships at the local and national levels" with corporations,
the government, and other foundations.  Godfrey predicts that a
number of existing priorities are likely to receive greater
attention, such as support for individual artists and
multi-cultural programing.  Pew is also looking into
opportunities for funding programs to increase public
appreciation of the arts and culture.
     Religion.  Joel A. Carpenter, the new program director for
religion, believes the importance of religious scholarship has
been underestimated by American academics.  "An anthropologist
going to New Guinea would never think of trying to understand
that culture without also studying its religion," explains
Carpenter, "but somehow American scholars have gotten into the
frame of mind that they can understand Western culture without
this critical component."  In addition to providing continued
support for religious scholarship, Carpenter says Pew will also
expand its support of church-based community service.  As a
beginning, Carpenter says Pew recently initiated a national small
grants program through World Vision that will support local
religious programs in housing, leadership development, and job
training.
     The environment.  The foundation recently hired Joshua S.
Reichert as its new program director for conservation and the
environment.  According to Reichert, the trusts look forward to,
and expect to encourage, a "groundswell of community-based
activism" on behalf of the environment.  Reichert says he will be
considering a wide range of opportunities to promote
environmentally sustainable economic development, strengthen
grass-roots environmental organizations, increase public
awareness, and encourage new public policy ideas for addressing
important environmental problems.
     Public policy.  Kevin F.F. Quigley is the trusts' new
program director for public policy.  While Quigley says the
program's basic priorities will remain the same, he adds that
some areas will receive greater emphasis in the coming years.  "I
will be exploring ways to build on our existing Economics and
National Security program to further strengthen the integration
of the two fields at the policy level," says Quigley.  "Also,
given the trusts' historic interests in supporting free markets
and democracy, we will be taking a closer look at how Pew might
more actively promote these values around the world, beginning in
Eastern Europe."
     In 1989, the Pew Charitable Trusts made grants totaling
roughly $146.7 million.  Of this amount, 46% went to health and
human services, 24% went to education, 14% went to culture, 8%
went to religion, 5% went to conservation and the environment,
and 4% went to public policy.  For more information about the
trusts, contact Deidra A. Lyngard, Communications Manager, Pew
Charitable Trusts, Three Parkway, Suite 501, Philadelphia, PA

WOODRUFF FOUNDATION JOINS TOP 20 U.S. FOUNDATIONS

     The Robert W. Woodruff Foundation, Atlanta, GA, has seen its
assets and giving levels skyrocket during the past year as it
continues to receive assets from the estate of Robert W.
Woodruff.
     At the end of 1987, the foundation had assets of $66.2
million.  By 1988, that figure had more than tripled, with
year-end assets of $194.5 million, and by 1989, assets had
reached $755.7 million.  The foundation estimates assets in the
area of $890 million by the end of this year, which puts it among
the top 20 U.S. foundations in terms of assets.
     Meanwhile, giving levels have bounded from almost $3 million
(1987), to $3.9 million (1988), up to $8.7 million (1989).
Projected total grants for 1990 reflect the foundation's new
wealth, with a contributions figure in the area of $25 million.
Background.  The foundation was established in 1937 by the late
Robert W. Woodruff.  Woodruff became president of the Coca-Cola
Company in the 1920s, and was instrumental in building the soft
drink company into an international business.  He had no children
and left most of his estate to the foundation when he died in
1985.
     The Woodruff Foundation's major priorities are education,
health care, the arts, social services, and the environment.
Most grant recipients are Georgia-based organizations such as
colleges and universities (Emory University has been a major
beneficiary), hospitals, and arts centers.  The foundation also
makes grants to out-of-state organizations for the benefit of
Georgia residents.  For example, the foundation has provided
funds for scholarship programs for students from Georgia.
     In 1988, the foundation gave 41% of total funding to the
arts, 27% to health organizations, 17% to civic groups, 12% to
educational institutions, and 3% to social service organizations.
     Contact Charles H. McTier, President, Robert W. Woodruff
Foundation, 230 Peachtree Street N.W., Suite 1400, Atlanta, GA
30303, (404) 522-6755.

     A U.S. district court has determined that the IRS properly
imposed a $64,000 excise tax on the Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation for failure to file annual reports on the progress of
a program-related investment (PRI).  In Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation v. U.S., the court found that the regulation requiring
annual reports on PRI grants was ambiguous.  However, the court
agreed with the IRS that requiring annual reports for the entire
life of the grant was more consistent with the overall regulatory
scheme.  The case concerned a $320,000 PRI grant made by Mott to
a community organization in 1976.  After filing annual reports on
the grant for the years 1976 to 1980, the foundation discontinued
its reports, believing that Treasury regulations required reports
for only the first three years of PRI grants.  In its decision,
the court noted that PRI grantees are required to report to the
grantor throughout the life of the PRI, making it consistent to
require that the grantor report to the IRS during the same
period.

     The Fred Meyer Charitable Trust, Portland, OR, has changed
its name, effective April 23 of this year, to Meyer Memorial
Trust.  According to the foundation, the name change results from
the foundation's desire to make it clear that the trust is a
private foundation, "not a company foundation related in any way
to Fred Meyer, Inc."  When Fred Meyer died in 1978, he left the
bulk of his estate to the trust, which provides funding for
social welfare, arts and humanities, education, and health
organizations.  The Meyer Memorial Trust has never owned stock in
or received any contributions from the company.  The street
address and telephone number for the trust have not changed: 1515
S.W. Fifth Avenue, Suite 500, Portland, OR 97201, (503) 228-5512.

     The Annie E. Casey Foundation, Greenwich, CT, has announced
a 50% increase in grants to aid disadvantaged children.  The
foundation, which accepts funding proposals only from preselected
organizations, will achieve the increase by allocating the
interest on its capital to grants rather than to its endowment.
As a result, funding for programs will increase from about $30
million next year to $45 million in 1993.  According to the
foundation, the extra funds will be used to increase support for
successful grassroots programs which are having difficulty with
fund raising.  Contact the foundation at 31 Brookside Drive,
Greenwich, CT 06830, (203) 661-2773.

GANNETT FOUNDATION TO SELL COMPANY STOCK

     Only a few months after a highly publicized headquarters
move to Arlington, VA, the Gannett Foundation is attracting
attention again with the announcement of plans to sell its
Gannett Company stock.  The foundation, headed by former Gannett
Company chairman Allen H. Neuharth, announced on April 25 that
its trustees had voted unanimously to retain an investment
banking firm to negotiate a possible sale of its 10% block of stock.
     The Gannett Foundation, which ranks in the top 20 U.S.
foundations in terms of assets, is currently the biggest Gannet
Company shareholder.  The Gannett stock represents the
foundation's only asset.
     According to a statement from foundation chairman Neuharth
and president Charles L. Overby, the foundation's decision to
sell its Gannett Company stock was motivated by IRS regulations
requiring foundations to pay out 5% of their assets each year.
The Gannett stock's annual dividend is $1.20 a share, which comes
to an annual yield of roughly 3.3%.
     At current market rates, the Gannett Foundation's 15,940,185
shares are worth between $550 million and $600 million.  Neuharth
and Overby said in their joint statement that "we will expand the
work of the USA's largest information-based foundation,
especially broadening programs in education, literacy, and First
Amendment freedoms."
     The foundation spent about $30 million on grants, programs,
and operations in 1989.  Areas of giving included journalism
(education, minority advancement, and professionalism); adult
literacy; special grants; local and community grants (for a
variety of nonprofits located in areas served by Gannett media);
philanthropy and volunteerism; and disaster relief.

of Communications, Gannett Foundation, 1101 Wilson Boulevard,

FORD FOUNDATION EXPANDS GRANT MAKING

     The Ford Foundation's two-year budget for 1990-91 calls for
a 13.2% increase in grant making compared to 1988-89, according
to the foundation.  Most giving programs, including urban
poverty, human rights and social justice, governance and public
policy, education and culture, and international affairs, will
increase grant making significantly.
     In addition, the foundation has sharply increased funding
for program-related investments (low-interest loans to
nonprofits) and for its general reserve fund, which the
foundation uses to meet unanticipated needs or respond to program
activities outside its usual categories.  The foundation has
slightly decreased funding for its rural poverty and resources
program.
     Approximately 35% of the Ford Foundation's program budget is
allocated for work in selected developing countries.  The
foundation recommends that grant applicants begin by sending a
short letter of inquiry to determine whether the foundation's
interests permit consideration of a formal proposal.
     Grant inquiries should be addressed to Barron M. Tenny, Vice
President, Secretary, and General Counsel, Ford Foundation, 320
East 43rd Street, New York, NY 10017, (212) 573-5000.

ELECTRONICS

Look for a Slowdown
in the Coming Year

According to the Semiconductor Industry Assn.s preliminary
numbers, the worldwide semiconductor device markets grew an
unprecedented 43.7% to well over $145 billion in 1995, after
predicting a growth rate of less than 15%.  The question of whether
market growth of this magnitude can be sustained at the 1995 level
or not remains.  In short, our reply is, no.  A look at the
markets driving forces in 1995 will fill in the blanks.

First, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) devices accounted for
nearly 30% of the total market, up from 17% as recently as 1993.
The major factor this past year, of course, was the release of
Windows 95 PC operating (OS) system, and its requirement of up to
16 megabytes of RAM for smooth operation.  Since 1993, the influx
of graphics-intensive software had pushed memory requirements to
the 8 megabyte range, where it remains for applications of this
type.  No new wunderkind software applications or OSs are on the
horizon to push RAM requirements up further.  Look for a leveling
of DRAM demand in particular to soften the market somewhat.

This is not to say the market will not experience healthy growth.
While the PC market, still the main silicon device driver, may have
matured in North America, other areas in the world are seeing PC
sales growth in the 20% per year range.  However, hardware
requirements have stabilized for the time being.  We see the
semiconductor market approaching $180 billion in 1996, which is an
increase of just over 23%.  Major beneficiaries of the overall
market are manufacturing equipment suppliers, who will ride for
free in 1996, with many companies reporting up to nine-month
backlogs in orders.

A market for which we see little potential is that for cheap, dumb
PC terminals under development for World Wide Web access.  Under
the concept, these machines would lack the standard hard drive,
floppy disks, and extensive software systems, but would still
require RAM and processor power.

Anyone who has cruised the Web will tell you that moving from site-
to-site is a tedious process, and speed is of the essence.  In
addition, online time is money, and for any system designed to
cruise the Web to be successful, it must provide the processing
power and memory needed to smoothly handle the graphics-intensive
Web.  At current prices, a powerful, 8 megabyte machine cannot be
built and sold with the hoped-for price tag of $500.  A system
built for more than that price will collect dust on warehouse
shelves (right alongside PDAs)!

INTSTRUMENTS

The Analytical Industry
Sharpens Its Focus

For instrument makers, 1995 was a year of recovery from poor
performance during 1993 and part of 1994.  A number of categories
have improved appreciably due to increased demand in segments of
industrial process applications and biomedical research.
Environmental applications are flat to shrinking, so a number of
suppliers are developing new strategies to reach other markets.

Instrument makers continue to find more ways to improve their
manufacturing methods by reducing the number of parts, simplifying
assembly steps and implementing more stringent testing of key
components.  The net result, in some cases, is a product that is
more reliable, and features more capabilities, while actually
costing less.

More importantly though, for future sales, a growing range of
sophisticated technologies are being adapted to various
instrumentation.  New detectors, more powerful computers, improved
methods of analysis, new reagents and other factors are pushing
many instruments to new levels of performance.  Also, other types
of hybrid instrumentation are finding new market niches and are
helping to expand the suppliers product lines.

Examples of new types of instrumentations that may find significant
markets in the future are the Smart Nose instruments, field-flow
fractionation (FFF),  and newly configured ion mobility
spectrometers.  Also, some product segments that were thought to be
technologically mature are showing surprising new innovations that
are reinvigorating those instrument segments.

BCC report G-181 The New Generation of Analytical Instruments, is
an upcoming report that surveys the 1995 analytical instrument
market, as well as international markets and projects units and
sales through 2005 for over 30 instruments.

The BCC estimate of the 1995 U.S. market for analytical
instruments, as defined by the Dept. of Commerce, was approximately
$5.1-$5.8 billion in shipments.  Related measuring instruments
would bring the figure closer to $6.5-$7.5 billion .  Projected
U.S. sales growth is projected to be approximately 5-7% through
2005.

It  is worth noting that of those shipments, $1.2-1.4 billion was
just in parts, components and accessories.  While the overall
market appears to have grown in the U.S. , the parts segment has
stayed flat.  For 1995, pending further data, the estimated value
of exports of analytical instruments from the U.S. was an estimated
$1.90-$2.1 billion, and imports were an estimated $1.2-$1.3
billion.

SEPARATIONS

Advances Point to
Steady Growth

The various ways of separating materials from mixtures are a
critical but little known part of industrial production.  From
pharmaceuticals to food and even waste treatment, producers rely on
these rapidly developing technologies. These techniques are also
key to research and analysis.

Lately, we are seeing increased interest in magnetic separations,
both on the research front and by commercial concerns.  Developing
technologies will advance this high tech market. Los Alamos
National Lab (Los Alamos, NM 87545) researchers are using high-
gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) to extract slightly magnetic
radioactive contaminants from soil or water.  The process primary
advantage is the lack of secondary waste produced.

In the pharmaceutical industry, PerSeptive Diagnostics (500 Old
Connecticut Path, Framingham, MA 10701; Tel: 617/499-1433) have
simplified the process of isolating GAC repeats using BioMag
Streptavidin and magnetic agarose.  While scientists report the use
of magnetic particles specifically for the isolation of CAG
repeats, in principle, the same techniques could be used to isolate
any gene for which a biotinylated PNA probe could be synthesized.


Diagnostic test maker, Ohmicron Environmental Diagnostics Inc. (375
Pheasant Run, Newtown, PA 18940; Tel: 800/544-8881), has
commercialized two new magnetic particle-based RaPID Assay
immunoassay test kits-cyclodienes and metribuzin.

Older processes have also advanced. Researchers continue to test
the boundary of capillary electrophoresis (CE) applications.
Recently, considerable attention has been focused on a highly
promising technique for metal ion analysis.  Andrei Timerbaev has
been developing a number of migration models based on a generally
valid equation for electrophoretic mobility as a function of charge
density.  Two major obstacles affecting CE are electroendosmotic
flow (EOF) and sample adsorption onto the capillary wall.

Researchers at the University of Uppsala (Dept. of Biochemistry,
Uppsala, Sweden) have developed a method of coating the capillaries
that eliminates both problems for a considerable length of time.
Beckman Instruments (2500 Harbor Blvd., Fullerton, CA 92634; Tel:
800/742-2345)  Chia-Hui Shieh has recently patented coated
capillary columns and a method for their use.

Supercritical fluids technology has also expanded its applications
horizons.  Two separate studies recently compared supercritical
fluid extraction (SFE) with liquid extraction as methods for
removing labile vitamins from creams, lotions, and tablets.  As a
result of their work, the researchers recommended SFE as a method
for quality-control analysis of pharmaceutical tablets.

Supercritical carbon dioxide is now being used as a method to
recover uranium and plutonium from nuclear wastes and spent fuels.
And Los Alamos National Lab (Chemical Science and Technology Div.,
Los Alamos, NM 87545) has used supercritical CO2 as a method of
precision cleaning that reduces hazardous waste.  The primary
advantage of this technique is the elimination of chlorocarbons and
chlorofluorocarbons as solvents.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS

Watch the Fiber
Optic Market

Market growth for fiber optic materials will increase at a rapid
pace, but not as fast in some segments as many industry sources
predicted a few years ago, says a new BCC business opportunity
report, Fiber Optic Materials.  The predicted market surge for
fiber optic materials in interexchange, or long distance carrier
applications and in networks involving a single building or a group
of buildings continues unabated.  On the other hand, the
uncertainly now creeping into the market revolves around the speed
with which the local exchange carriers (LECs) will upgrade their
residential networks.

Fiber optic materials represent much of the physical structure
needed for existing telecommunications systems, as well as for the
vast networks envisioned for installation during the remainder of
this decade and the 21st century. Telecommunications systems
capable of providing voice, data, text, and video to a variety of
users will require large increases in the ability to transmit an
enormous number of signals over both long and short distances.
Technical advances in erbium-doped amplifiers, plastic optical
fiber (POF), and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technologies, to
name only a few, are spurring the deployment of fiber optic
networks.

Two segments of the fiber optic material market, fiber from local
exchanges to the curb and fiber from the curb to the home, were the
subject of very (some would say wildly) optimistic growth estimates
as recently as 1994.  Now many industry sources believe that for
the next 5-10 years, in most cases, fiber optic service will end at
the neighborhood level.

There are several regions for the new uncertainty in these market
segments.  First, the expected merging of and blurring of the
distinct lines between regional telephone companies and cable
television operators is not occurring nearly as fast as previously
predicted.  Second, although legislation opening up competition in
local communications markets is certain, the pace of its
implementation may be slower than previously thought.  Finally,
despite huge drops in the cost of fiber optic network components,
the rush to replace copper and coaxial cable in these applications
has been slower than forecast.

The BCC Fiber Optic Materials report presents a detailed view of
world market size, growth, and trends for this industry.  The major
product lines and applications are identified, and the market size
for each product line and application is estimated for the next
five years.  Significant global technological trends and
developments in materials and applications are identified and
analyzed, and the structure of the industry is addressed.  Profiles
of the major fiber optic materials suppliers are provided.

This BCC report provides in-depth information and technological
evaluations for decision making by those involved in the supply of
fiber optic materials to the telecommunications industry.  This
study can assist users in strategic planning, acquisition analysis,
technology analysis, commercial development of new products, and
analysis of competitors strategies, strengths, weaknesses,
pricing, market share, and profitability.

MEMBRANES

A Technology That
Is Coming of Age

1996 is expected to see membrane based technologies increasingly
incorporated into large scale industrial processes.  Progress is
expected to continue in an evolutionary mode with newer membranes
and devices overcoming earlier shortcomings such as flux, fouling,
and scalability. Some of the new concepts up for trial during the
year might include contained liquid membranes, membrane based
stripping, extraction and adsorption. Hybrid process will bring in
membrane separations to augment what cannot be attained
economically by either process on a stand alone basis.

Ultrafiltration (UF) is up for a greater variety of materials to
help out the reliable polysulfone. Zirconia on alumina or some
other type of inorganic may find wider acceptance. PVDF and
modified PANs can find their niche. Crossflow operational modes for
UF and MF (microfiltration) will increasingly be the norm.

Pervaporation (PV) will continue its commercial acceptance, but it
is a hard sell.  Potential users do not know what this versatile
money maker can really do for them. Removal of organics from water
via hydrophobic silicone membranes on a microporous substrate in
the spiral wound configuration is being commercialized.  Hollow
fiber units with transverse feed flow have been developed. Yet to
be commercialized is the Exxon process to separate
aromatics/saturates in the same boiling range into an aromatics-
lean retentate for diesel and an aromatics-rich permeate for high
octane gasoline using a polyimide/polyadipate copolymer membrane.

Membrane processes that remove VOCs from air or nitrogen should be
better accepted.  Cation exchange membranes for continuous
deionization should find wider use in deionized water production.
Condensation has been integrated with vapor permeation for VOC
removal and additional hybrids such as cryo-membrane permeation,
membrane-PSA, and cryogenic-membrane-PSA have been patented. A
relatively new commercial development is the membrane phase
contactor for use in extraction, absorption, and stripping. An
example of the absorption application of the membrane phase
contactor is used in the beverage industry to add carbon dioxide to
aqueous solutions for carbonation.

Non-separating functions of membranes are expected to advance in
total usage.  Artificial skin, controlled release applications,
biomemitic devices, and breathable fabrics are all examples. Bag
filters still dominate the particulate/air entrapment market, but
low cost membranes could take market share.  An entire market area
could open up if a really low cost membrane material for disposable
diapers could be produced.

separations industry. She is managing director of Membrane &

PLASTICS

Market Turns to
the Pacific Rim

The plastics industry has been able to absorb some overcapacity
because of increased demand.  However, the spectre of overcapacity
still plagues the industry for many commodity resins because of
rapid expansion in capacities in Pacific Rim countries.
Continuance of this scenario will result in lower prices, and
operating rates along with reduced profits.

Opportunities for plastics consumption are strong in Asia, Africa,
and the Mideast, with Eastern Europe still lagging behind the
global pace.  However, only the Asian market is of significant
volume.

Main driving forces for plastics consumption still reside with
traditional markets led by automotive, consumer products, and
electrical/electronic. In addition to new polymerization advances
characterized by metallocene technologies, other aspects still
being pursued include alloying/blending, and use of reinforcements
to enhance existing properties.

Metallocene-based resins have expanded from polyethylene to
polypropylene with polystyrene versions expected in a year or two.
The high cost of producing metallocene resins will probably be
minimized by converting existing reactors (retrofitting).  In
addition, it is expected that metallocene catalysts will be used in
conjunction with traditional catalysts combining advantages of
both.

Foamed resins have been at the center of the environmental scene
with replacements of CFCs by HCFCs as blowing agents.  The
worldwide agreement to ban CFCs (Montreal Protocol) has been moved
up to the year 2000.  Recycled plastic markets are still dominated
by PET bottles and HDPE.  Packaging will remain the largest market
for recycled resins for the next few years.

BIOTECHNOLOGY

Still Survival
of the Fittest

Seeing into the future can be a bit tricky.  We're reminded of the
Coney Island fortune teller who predicted we'd soon take a journey
over water.  The next day it rained and in the course of our
peregrinations we stepped over a puddle, fulfilling the prophecy.


Predicting this year's unfolding of biotechnology events is
something like that Coney Island experience: if they're general
enough, predictions surely will come to pass, like saying some
biotechnology companies in 1996 will probably succeed while others
will probably have to pack it in. Some products in clinical trials
will pass, while others will fail.

But which ones?  If that could be known ahead of time, one could
make a fortune.  Some people of course believe that test tube
experiments and preclinical studies with animal models can foretell
the future, can tell how the candidate drugs will behave in humans.
And a lot of bets are placed on such forecasts.

One of the big events of the year just past is the recognition that
some biotechnology efforts may fail, just as surely as some will
succeed. We may not know precisely which category any particular
venture may fall into, but just the mere recognition that failure
may occur represents a far cry from biotechnology's earlier, heady
days of overconfidence. Building in plans for the unexpected
"impossibilities" provides companies with mechanisms in place to
let them cope with uncertainty, and survive.

Forecasting is not all speculation, of course, although it can be
wishful thinking.  If a product passes its trials, and if it
receives regulatory approval, and if  it captures an assumed
percentage share of its available market, then a reasonable
forecast of its possible sales can be made and the manufacturing
capacity to fulfill that demand can be rationally planned.  The
"trick" lies in being as objective (at least with oneself) in
making business forecasts as in designing laboratory experiments.

Some forecasting is done by extrapolating from the past and
present, in light of unfolding forces for change. On this basis,
predicting biotechnology events in 1996 is made a little easier by
considering several discernible trends.

    Virtualization of the pharmaceutical industry will accelerate.
Big pharma surrounds itself with drug discovery firms to fulfill
its research needs, while biotechnology companies surround
themselves with contract manufacturers. It's cheaper and less
committal than hiring in these functions. Marketing may become the
next function to be outsourced.

    Differentiation of the biotechnology industry will become more
transparent. Companies divide into those seeking to commercialize
biomolecules and those seeking to commercialize chemical molecules
acting on biological targets. They also divide into discoverers of
candidate targets for therapeutic intervention and developers of
actual drug candidates.

    The struggle to survive will become more intense. Not only is
it getting harder to raise money to sustain research, in view of
coming cuts in the federal budget, but biotechnology companies will
increasingly be judged on their ability to actually deliver
products for sale.

CERAMICS

Less Hype--and
Some Real Growth

One important aspect of the U.S. advanced ceramics industry now is
that the Ceramics Fever of the early and mid-1980s has gone and
a new realization has come among the suppliers of advanced ceramic
components. One good example was the hype over ceramic engines,
thought to be a reality for the 1990s with the component suppliers
competing for shares of a market which failed to materialize.

Another setback to the U.S. advanced ceramics industry has been the
drastic cuts in U.S. military programs.  A good example of this is
the militarys earlier plan to use ceramic armor on land-based
vehicles by the late 1980s.  This has been postponed to a later
date and in some cases abandoned altogether.

BCC has been studying the various advanced ceramics market segments
for the last 10 years.  The recession in the early 1990s had
severely affected certain segments of the advanced ceramics
industry such as structural ceramics and in a limited way, the
ceramic coating business.  Electronic ceramics has not been much
affected by the last fact. The electronics segment has been growing
at a faster rate than our own earlier forecast in 1990 and 1992.

In a recent study to be published in March 1996 (DCD96, Complete
Guide to the U.S. Advanced Ceramics Industry), BCC has attempted to
analyze the overall market potential in the U.S.  BCC has further
estimated the size of the 1995 and future market potential for the
various advanced ceramics market segments in the U.S.  The total
value of the U.S. advanced ceramic components market for 1995 is
estimated to be $5.5 billion.  This will increase to $8.7 billion
by the year 2000 with a growth rate of 9.5% from 1995 to 2000.

Sewing Up 1995 Figures,
Projecting into 1996

Economists participating in the Blue Chip survey of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland, anticipate a 2.4% rate of real economic
growth in 4th quarter 1995--well below last quarters 4.2% advance.
The recent flatness in industrial production and hours worked seems
consistent with this slowdown.  For all of 1995, the Blue Chip
panel foresees a growth rate of approximately 3.2%.  Economists
estimate the nations long-term growth potential at roughly 2.5%
per year.

A boom in business fixed investment has accompanied the current
business expansion, but curiously, the underlying factors have not
ignited residential construction.  Despite some improvement in the
3rd quarter of 1995, new home construction has been a relatively
weak component of GDP this year.  Real residential investment fell
1.4% in the four quarters ending in quarter three of 1995.  With
single-unit housing starts remaining generally weak, residential
construction will most likely stay soft.  Housing starts declined
1.7% in October, the second consecutive monthly drop.

An interesting note, although probably nothing that will take
shape, is that the latest inflation indicators are showing
surprising volatility.  After a four-month gain of only 1.8%, the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) accelerated to a 4.0% annualized rate in
October.

The median CPE--a measure of core inflation--slowed to 3.3%,
hovering between its year-to-date and five-year rates.

Taking a longer perspective, the 12-month change in the CPI and the
median CPI rose to 2.7% and 3.3%, respectively.  Both are higher
than 1994 rates, but are still within or below the central tendency
range projected by the Federal Open Market Committee last July.

The Blue Chip forecast paints a far more favorable picture of
expected inflation.  The November 10 projection shows significant
improvement over forecasts made at the beginning of the year.  In
January, over 57% of economists were predicting that inflation
would reach 3.5% of more.  In November, that share fell to less
than 5%.

MNCs to Change
Basic Structure

The National Assn. of Business Economists (1233 20th St. NW, Suite
505, Washington, DC 20036; Tel: 202/463-6223), forecasts
international trade as a source of growth for 1996.  Net exports
should average $116.4 billion, an improvement of $7.5 billion over
1995.

The largest consumer markets in the world--China, India, and the
many countries that comprise the ex-Soviet Union--are in a state of
fundamental transition, and are potentially very lucrative markets.
China, for example, is gradually letting other countries into its
markets.  Chinas electronics market has experienced an over 20%
average annual growth rate during the 1990s, and is expected to
reach $40 billion in semiconductor sales in 1996.  And the market
is far from mature.  Mexico is another tantalizing market,
especially for U.S. companies to explore, provided CEOs can stomach
the dips, twists and turns that the Mexican market endures.

As the world becomes a truly global marketplace, more risk is going
hand-in-hand with more opportunity.  Multinational corporations
(MNCs) and companies looking to do business in foreign countries
will need to make a switch in their organizations. One way to
better position the organization is instead of just happening to
have expatriates in various countries around the world, companies
will start reorganizing their management structure to create a
culture of international-savvy managers who will help in getting
the most out of the outstanding economic opportunities that are
presenting themselves in foreign countries. This will make the
organization more flexible, with better understanding and ability
to handle the foreign markets.

In the next year, MNCs will probably start to undertake changes in
organization.  After assessing opportunities around the world, and
taking into account technologies such as video conferencing, a flat
organizational structure will take hold. There will be switches to
several headquarters, instead of one central one in the dominant
country.  Each region that is economically important will receive
an important group of professionals from the headquarters.

In the world we will soon see, top management all from the same
country will be a weakness of a MNC.  Managements understanding of
the culture in a foreign market by persons either from or very
familiar with the country will prove to be the difference between
the most successful MNCs and the also-rans.

Commerce Department
Reduces Export Controls

Action by the Commerce Department to reduce export controls that
create obstacles such as licensing burdens and delays for U.S.
semiconductor companies drew nothing but praise from the
Semiconductor Industry Association (181 Metro Drive, Suite 450, San
Jose, CA 95110; Tel: 408/436-6600, Fax: 408/436-6646).  The new
regulation, which went into effect Dec. 20, liberalizes export
controls on certain semiconductor devices shipped to China, the
republics of the former Soviet Union, and certain other
destinations for civilian end uses.

In a statement released to coincide with the start of the new
policy, SIA President Thomas W. Armstrong said, "This modernization
of export controls on semiconductors will greatly reduce needless
and costly licensing delays and burdensome paperwork.  These
reductions will lead to further export opportunities in areas with
major growth potential over the next decade."

The SIA notes that commercial semiconductors represent one of the
least controllable and most widely available high-technology
products in the world today.  Further maintenance of the old export
controls would have damaged U.S. industry without making any
material contribution to U.S. security.

Armstrong added, "The Commerce Department has made substantial
progress in the reduction of outmoded export licensing
requirements.  Continuation of this export liberalization process
to reflect the end of the Cold war will only stimulate business
opportunities and job creation."

In a related development, SIA also reported that the foreign share
in the Japan market for semiconductors rose more than 3% in the
third quarter to 26.2%.  Though no specific figures regarding the
U.S. share of the increase were available, Armstrong touted the
competitiveness of domestic chip makers as well as the U.S.-Japan
agreement as major factors.  SIA spokesman Jeff Weir said that
indications pointed to a substantial U.S. share in the increase.

Armstrong also added that strong relationships between the U.S.
and Japanese industries are being built, which would not have been
possible without the agreement.  Weir emphasized the SIAs support
for renewal of the pact, due this year, which is meeting some
resistance in Japan.

Managed Care
Is Really Here

Healthcare delivery in the U.S. and in most countries throughout
the world will experience significant change in 1996. The challenge
of  boards, management and physicians, says Albert W. Herman,
partner in charge of the Healthcare Services Group of global
accounting, tax and advisory firm Arthur Andersen LLP, will be to
provide the right care, at the right time, in the right amount, in
the right way and be able to prove it.

Market-based changes continue to challenge physicians, executives
and boards of directors in the healthcare industry.  Mergers,
alliances and affiliations among and between providers will
continue unabated in 1996, and managed care will continue its
market penetration across the country, according to Herman.

Based on the latest data available, about 18% of the total U.S.
population is enrolled in some type of managed care arrangement;
about 9% of all Medicare beneficiaries are in a managed care plan,
and about 23% of all Medicaid enrollees are in managed care as
well.  These percentages all will show marked increases in 1996.

At the same time, the debate and decisions from Capitol Hill, the
White House, and the state capitals will continue to influence
provider decision-making as will the initiatives and investigations
pursued by regulators such as the Dept. of Justice, Inspector
General, FBI, IRS, and the SEC.

The managed care market will mature as employers encourage workers
to switch to managed care, and as leading managed care groups and
medical groups begin to consolidate.  The momentum for direct
contracting between the payer and the care provider will grow in
1996, as will enrollee choice of their healthcare providers.
Eventually, managed care risk will shift to integrated delivery
systems, purchasers will contract with these systems for
comprehensive services, and capitation will prevail.

Rapid Change In
Device Market

Daphne Allen, assistant editor of Medical Device & Diagnostic
Industry, has analyzed the growth in the number of registered
medical device manufacturers in the U.S.  Data were obtained from
the FDAs Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance, which is a
part of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

During the period between August 1994 and August 1995, the FDA
recorded an increase of 1,737 registered medical device companies.
Overall, however, the total number of medical device establishments
has declined by 2%.  In addition to companies who leave the device
industry, the decline may be attributed to mergers, acquisitions,
consolidation of sites, and business failures.

The study indicated that six states provide the homes of nearly 47%
of the registered manufacturers.  California led the pack with
1,920 companies; New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Florida, and
Texas are also important locations for manufacturers.  The analysis
was published in Volume 17, No. 10

Fluorine Compounds
Surge Past Problems

Fluorine compounds are all around us and we use them every day,
despite the fact that most people do not know them as such.
"Performance chemicals" can be defined as those which do a specific
job, based on their physical and/or chemical properties, that other
products and materials do not do as well.

As a market for potential growth, total sales for performance
fluorine and chemical polymers should grow from a market value of
$3.8 billion in 1994 to reach $4.1 billion by 1999, an average
annual growth rate (AAGR) of 1.8%.

Chlorofluorocarbons are the largest segment of the total market as
well as the problem that needs to be untangled for the entire
market to sustain growth, but other segments of the fluorine and
chemical polymers market will see respectable growth at least up to
the next century.

Aromatics, a segment of organic fluorochemicals used primarily for
chemical processing, have a 1994 market value of $6 million,
forecasted to grow to $7 million by 1999, resulting in an AAGR of
5.9%

Inorganic fluorochemicals perform many diverse uses, ranging from
fluorides for water treatment and toothpaste, to the large volume
hydrogen fluoride and expensive, highly pure electronic etchants.
The 1994 market value for all inorganics was $567 million,
projected to reach $647 million by 1999, resulting in a 2.7% AAGR.

Fluoropolymers consist of polymer resins such as PTFE and PVDF,
fluoroelastomers, and low molecular weight polymers used as
surfactants, functional fluids, textile finishing chemicals to
impart water and oil repellency, and as chemical intermediates.
The 1994 market value for fluoropolymers is $1.35 billion and will
be $1.76 billion by 1999, reaching a 5.4% AAGR.

Business Communications Co., Inc. has recently published a study
titled Performance Fluorine and Chemical Polymers: Future

Carbon Nitride: A
Designer Abrasive

Scientists at the Carnegie Institution (Washington, DC) have used
a combination of state-of-the-art physics, supercomputers, and
insight gained from the study of minerals to predict the first
feasibly synthesizable material that is more incompressible than
diamond. Their calculations show that this material, a cubic form
of carbon nitride, C3N4, should be significantly less compressible
than diamond at room conditions.

Inasmuch as low compressibility is correlated with hardness, it is
highly possible that the new material could be harder than diamond
and therefore of significant technological use as a superabrasive
material and for wear-resistant coatings.

These results, reported in the January 5 issue of Science , rest
upon state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical calculations. The levels
of speed and accuracy now attainable in such calculations enable
investigators to design materials by doing experiments on the
computer instead of in the laboratory. Scientists are thus
beginning to rationally design useful materials in a more efficient
manner than by the traditional "shake-and-bake" methodology of
finding new materials.

The investigators in the new work are David Teter and Russell
Hemley, both serving at Carnegie's Geophysical Lab and Center for
High Pressure Research. Teter and Hemley's work grew from
widespread interest in the possibility of finding new low
compressibility materials. Various forms of carbon nitrides had
been proposed as possible superhard materials potentially exceeding
diamond in hardness. Teter and Hemley identified several favorable
candidate C3N4 prototype forms and calculated their energetics,
structures and physical properties. They determined the cubic-C3N4
form to be the most incompressible.

Their calculations indicate that the cubic- C3N4 material can be
synthesized at pressures and temperatures now attainable in the
laboratory. (The material would be formed at high pressure and
temperature, and then quenched stably to ambient conditions.)
Scientists at the Carnegie institution and elsewhere are already
working to accomplish this, employing insights gained from the
theoretical work now reported. Conceivably, the material can
eventually be synthesized at an industrial scale using technology
similar to that now used to synthesize industrial diamond.

Teter and Hemley write that most experimental studies of carbon
nitrides have been carried out at ambient or low-pressure
conditions; their results indicate the importance of high-pressure
synthesis in the search for new carbon nitrides.

Home Office Workers
Are a Dynamic Market

Home offices have been in existence for years, from the employees
who are scheduled to work at home, to the after hours workers, and
including the self-employed home office worker.   Only recently,
though, have the home office workers become in vogue, their needs
just beginning to be addressed by office equipment manufacturers.
According to a new report from Business Communications Co., Inc.,
home office workers are a market segment with purchasing power
needing computers, peripherals, software,  office products and
ancillary services.

In report G-189 The Home Office: Markets for Equipment, Supplies
and Services, despite marginal growth in the overall workforce by
the year 2000, the home office segment will expand from 45.7
million individuals in 1995 to 60.9 million workers by 2000,
resulting in an average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 5.9%.

Computers are an essential part of many home offices.  In 1995,
home office workers purchased over $13 billion worth of all types
of computers. The market is expected to grow to nearly $30 billion
by the year 2000,  reaching a 17.5% AAGR.

It is up to the manufacturers to recognize potential specialized
equipment to target this consumer group. Fully configured products,
such as computers or some peripherals, that can be accommodated
within smaller spaces would be the first logical product niche, as
the typical home office is in the basement or in the corner of the
living room, or may be in a spare bedroom.

The peripheral market segment for the home office includes
printers, software, modems, ISDN, email,  and related technologies
and remote access.  In 1995, the peripheral market for home offices
was over $42 billion.  By the year 2000, the forecast for the
peripheral market is for it to reach over $70 billion, resulting in
an AAGR of 10.8%.

The entire home office consumer purchases in 1995 was over $79
billion worth of equipment for their office environment.  The 2000
projection for this market is for the home office consumer to spend
over $132 billion, reaching a 10.7% AAGR.

'Ghost Sites' On The
World Wide Web

International Data Corp. (IDC, Five Speen St., Framingham, MA
01701) has predicted 1996 to be a year of disappointment as
investors and corporations suffer through the discouragingly slow
development of a significant consumer base. By the end of the year,
IDC predicts 20% of the Fortune 500 companies that have commercial
Web sites will close or stop maintaining them, resulting in ghost
sites. The leading online information service providers will derive
more than one-half of their revenue from providing access to the
Web by mid-1997.

IDC predicts that "In 1996 ... the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's 'intoxication' stage to a
'hangover' stage. The high-flying Internet suppliers will have
disappointing financial results, while technical capabilities of
the Internet are stretched to the breaking point." Although IDC
predicts the overall growth in online subscribers will continue to
be very strong, they expect 1996 to show a high turnover rate as
users disappointed by the content on the Web cancel their online
subscriptions.

But, they also predict that during the next five years, the number
of online users will rise to more than 200 million, and by 2010, it
will exceed 1 billion. Industry revenues will jump from $500
billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and corporate spending
will rise from 2 to 2.5% of revenues to more than 5%. In addition,
IDC believes online commerce volume will hit $150 billion or more
by the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

A full copy of IDC's 1996 predictions can be found on IDC's home
page. The address is http://www.idcresearch.com. Interested parties
are welcome to share views and insights with Frank Gens, senior VP
of research at IDC, via email at fgens@idcresearch.com. For more

Virtual Reality
Is No Illusion

Virtual reality (VR) has been identified as one of the 10 most
promising technologies currently under development.  This new
technology brings upon itself many problems, including the effect
science fiction has had on the perception of VR technology as well
as difficulties in defining the technology.  Nonetheless, there
remains a class of technology that can confidently be defined as
"virtual reality" and analyzed like any other emerging high tech
industry.  This technology is currently used on a routine basis in
a number of markets, and has the potential to enter many more.

At the end of 1995, over 300 companies will sell approximately $255
million worth of VR products and services.  By 2000, the VR
industry will be posting annual sales of over $1 billion and
reaching an annual average growth rate (AAGR) of 33%.  Although
about half of the 2000 market will go for home- and site- based
entertainment, VR products will be used by all facets of society,
including commercial/industrial, the government, military, and
university and secondary schools.

A comprehensive document from Business Communications Co., Inc.
entitled The Virtual Reality Business, reports that the
instructional and developmental market for VR is expected to grow
from a $95 million 1995 market figure to $355 million by 2000,
resulting in an AAGR of 31%.  This figure includes VR technology
that will be present in technical/engineering colleges and
universities, and the "developmental" VR includes spending on
advanced, but as yet non-commercial applications, along with pure
science and research systems not included in the other categories.

Applications of design and development VR market are in
engineering, architecture and chemical design and development.
This market will grow from a 1995 market value of $30 million, to
$150 million by 2000, reaching an AAGR of 40%.

Entertainment uses account for the largest VR market value, and are
expected to continue growing at a 35% AAGR to the year 2000.  A
mass-produced single-user entertainment VR system will be the
driving force behind the growth of this market growth, from a 1995
value of $110 million to $500 million by 2000.

Medical treatment VR market will also sustain growth.  The 1995
market value of $20 million is projected to reach $50 million by
2000, reaching a 20% AAGR.

Mid-IR Laser
Likes it Warm

A team of scientists from the Naval Research Laboratory and the
University of Houston Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center (SVEC) has
developed a mid-infrared solid-state laser that operates at near
room temperature.

According to Shin-Shem Steven Pei, SVEC's associate director for
research (Tel: 713/ 743-3621, E-mail: spei@uh.edu), lasing was
observed at temperatures up to 285K. "This is by far the highest
operating temperature for an interband transition laser at this
wavelength," he explained. "We now have a device that works with a
compact thermoelectric cooler instead of a unwieldy cryogenic
system, and room-temperature operation is just around the corner."

The new laser is an optically-pumped InAs/GaInSb/AlInSb type-II
quantum-well structure producing light at a wavelength of 4
microns. The device was fabricated from materials produced by SVEC
and then tested at the NRL. The NRL/SVEC team is now optimizing the
material growth and device design for diode lasers that can produce
sufficient power at 3 to 5 microns without cooling. Currently, SVEC
scientists are also testing a more advanced quantum-cascade laser
design, which should produce higher-intensity light with less
electric current while emitting within either of two atmospheric
transmission windows of 3 to 5 microns and 8 to 12 microns.

Lasers emitting in these windows have many important industrial,
medical, and military applications, such as IR radar for vehicle
and air traffic control, medical diagnosis, eye-safe covert
illumination for night vision, free-space communications, and IR
countermeasures.  Further, since many gases absorb strongly in
these windows, these lasers are ideal for remote chemical sensing.
This large class of applications includes pollution and greenhouse-
gas monitoring, drug and explosives detection, chemical process
control, and leak detection.  The projected market for these IR
systems will approach $1.5 billion by 2001 if efficient and compact
IR sources are available.

The semiconductor lasers used in most consumer devices emit at much
shorter wavelengths. Long-distance telephone networks use 1.3 and
1.5 micron lasers in their optical fiber systems, and a 0.8 micron
beam reads music and data from CDs.  (By comparison, visible light
ranges from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns.) However, water vapor readily
absorbs light with wavelengths outside the atmospheric transmission
windows, restricting its range.  Gas lasers operating within the
windows are too bulky and expensive for most commercial
applications.

Display Panels Made
from Plastic Wrap

U.S. Patent 5,469,020 was issued on Nov. 21, 1995, to the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a flexible large-screen
display that has multiple light-emitting elements sandwiched
between crossed electrodes.  The inventor is Bradley R. Herrick
(Lincoln Laboratory, Cambridge, MA 02139; Tel: 617/981-3356).  The
resulting panels are especially well adapted to inexpensive flat-
panel TV screens or exceptionally large flat-panel displays whose
geometry is not limited to flat surfaces, but may take on curved or
cylindrical configurations.

The patent abstract explains that active light-emitting components
are integrated into a thin, flexible, plastic-wrap like film to
provide an exceptionally large continuous display in which the film
contains densely distributed light-emitting elements that are
addressed by a grid of transparent conductors.  Inexpensive bulk
processing techniques are used to produce plastic wrap with
embedded components completely through the film to permit
activation via a row-column matrix.  The displays are comprised of
a flexible film having two opposing sides and a pair of crossed
electrodes on either side of the film.  A number of light-emitting
elements are dispersed`ig the film and extend from one side of the
film to the other, sandwiched between the crossed electrodes.  The
light-emitting elements are small enough to permit numbers of the
elements to exist at a crossover.

The topological layout provides mass redundancy of components,
spatial decorrelation of component yields, and dramatic reduction
in registration problems of metallic interconnects.  The design can
be used for electroluminescent tape in automotive pin striping and
sign applications, for flexible glue-on displays, and for video
displays such as workstations, HDTV, theater screens, and
billboards.

Herrick explained that the patent is based on theory for the time
being, and that no working models currently exist.  He also said
that calculations indicate that the thinner the plastic the better,
and he would initially be working with films in the 10 to 100
micron thickness range.  The concept involves placing up to
hundreds of diodes in a single pixel, making the technology most
suitable to displays larger than 60 inches diagonally and scaleable
to even larger sizes.  He is currently assembling a production team
and says the only real problem is the same one faced industry-wide
-- blue diodes.

Interactive Holography
Will Be Evaluated

American Propylaea Corp. (555 S. Woodward, Birmingham, MI 48009;
Tel: 810/642-7000) has been awarded a $100,000 research contract by
the U.S. Air Force to evaluate the integration of interactive
holography in manufacturing.  James Fischbach, president and CEO,
reports that the contract represents Phase 1 of a projected 15-
phase $200 million project if Phase 1 is successful.  Phase 2 would
involve $750,000, and Phase 3 would be worth $5 million.

American Propylaea, which developed the worlds first full color
commercial hologram in 1993, scored a major breakthrough in 1994
when it achieved a 42 inch x 45 inch, full motion, true color
holographic display system, the largest yet developed.  Fischbach
predicts that holography will be a $5 billion per year business
within 10 years and identifies the automotive, entertainment,
medical, and retail markets as those with the greatest potential.

Fischbach says that interactive holography could make it possible
for automakers to cut design and development time by 50%, enabling
them to bring new car models to market in under 20 months, compared
with the present 42 months in the U.S. and 36 months in Japan.
Holography could also reduce the need for exploratory surgery and
assist in the training of surgeons, enabling them to view 3-D
information in free space in front of a monitor screen to help them
detect and locate abnormalities and rehearse operations.

Low Temperature
Growth Method

A chemist at Washington University in St. Louis (St. Louis, MO
63130) has discovered a new method to grow semiconductor crystals
at temperatures far lower than ever reported.  The method is the
first to use solution phase chemistry to grow the micrometer-sized
crystals at low temperature.  The semiconductors made by the new
method may be used in devices such as light emitting diode (LED)
displays, laser pointers, grocery scanners, compact disc players
and computer components.  The breakthrough offers intriguing
possibilities of developing integrated devices consisting of
semiconductors and polymers, plastics or composites.

Present ways of growing semiconductor crystals prohibit combining
other materials with the semiconductors because of the very high
temperatures required to grow the crystals.  Crystals are currently
produced at temperatures of 500-1,200C, but the method William E.
Buhro (Tel: 314/935-4269, email: buhro@wuchem.wustl.edu), associate
professor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis, has
discovered allows growth at 200C.  Buhros technique, the
solution-liquid-solid (SLS) growth method, is similar to the vapor-
liquid-solid (VLS) gas phase growth method which has been used for
some 30 years.

Buhro and other materials chemists had been stymied by the
nonmolecular structures of the semiconductor materials, which do
not allow crystal growth from conventional solvents at low
temperatures.  Buhro made a solution suspension of indium and
indium-gallium nano-sized metal droplets.  The droplets are the
sites from which the semiconductor crystal compounds indium
phosphide, gallium arsenide and indium arsenide (type III-V
semiconductors) nucleate and grow.

Buhro explains, "We refer to this as the solution-liquid-solid
mechanism, a three phase system where the chemistry occurs in
solution, then elements of the semiconductors are deposited into
the liquid--the molten metal droplets--and the product crystallizes
out as a solid."  An important goal in materials chemistry is to
turn down the heat on solid state synthesis.  This new method
expands the range of possibility for these semiconductors.

Building a New Flat
Panel Video Screen

A researcher at the Dept. of Energy (DOE) Brookhaven National Lab
(Box 5000, Upton, NY 11973-5000) has invented a flat panel video
screen that uses lasers as a light source.  Uses of the device may
include video advertising displays, television, computers,
automotive dashboard and aircraft cockpit displays, as well as
portable military maps and wall-sized displays for home
entertainment.  Since the Brookhaven device has advantages in
brightness, contrast, and viewing angle over the new generation of
liquid crystal cockpit displays, the U.S. Air Force is funding
development of the flat panel device for use in its new planes.

In another project involving the new technology funded by the Dept.
of Defense (DOD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA),
Brookhaven also is working on a 5 ft. plastic television screen for
military use.

The Clinton Administration has identified developing flat panel
displays as vital to the economic future of the U.S.  Brookhaven
engineer James Veligdan (Tel: 516/282-5400) invented the device and
developed the display screen prototype, which is 9 in. wide by 5
in. high and approximately 1 in. thick.  The new flat panel screen
has several advantages over current technologies.

Many video display systems now on the market use cathode ray tubes
(CRTs).  Although reliable, they are very large, heavy, and not
easily transportable.  Other than CRTs, the major current video
display technology is limited to liquid crystal displays (LCDs),
which are comparatively difficult and expensive to manufacture.

The Brookhaven technology works by directing light from a miniature
laser to a scanner, which guides the light beam into the proper
sector of laminated wave guides.  Composed of multiple sheets of
laminated borosilicate glass or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)
plastic, the waveguides direct the light to the screen to display
the video image.

"The system is totally eye safe, high-contrast, and offers
exceptionally wide viewing angles.  Also, the screen can be used in
cold weather, whereas liquid crystals thicken and freeze as
temperatures dip below freezing.  The technology can be adapted to
display 3D images if the viewer wears polarized glasses.
Maintenance is easy and inexpensive, says Veligdan.

COMMISSION TO DECIDE ON NEW YORK PETITION ON PLAYGROUNDS

Deciding whether to deny a petition from the New York City Dept. of Consumer
Affairs for a mandatory standard on home playground equipment will be on the
CPSC commissioners' agenda for January 1996.  The commissioners will receive
agency staff recommendations on the petition suggestions that go beyond ASTM
standards.

Though there have been no injuries or deaths, the department wants to impose
its own standards that include requirements for handrails, surfacing, and
prohibiting more than one activity on the same playground apparatus.  The
department based its recommendations on a survey it conducted.  ASTM Chair
for Home Playground Equipment Terri Hendy told PSL she is not sure whether
the commissioners will go ahead with the New York petition and said her group
has been working on revising ASTM standards.

While ASTM standards require home playground sets to not be placed on con-
crete, asphalt or grass, 1996 revisions will go the extra mile by listing
acceptable surfaces such as 8-10 inches of pea gravel, sand or wood mulch.
Also, home daycare centers with 10 children or fewer will have to comply with
ASTM home playground equipment standards.
Hendy said the current standard does not address small home daycare centers.

Other standard modifications the group wants to beef up are guardrails for
elevated platforms, determining the level of force that can be sustained by a
head when a multiple occupancy swing strikes it, and swing set packaging
stating if anchoring is required and if an anchoring set is included.

CRACKING BIKE FRAMES LED TO BROKEN BONES AND RECALL

Mountain bicycle frames that can fracture in the front at the headlug led to
injuries ranging from cuts and bruises to broken bones and a recall.  Riders
are in danger of being thrown from the bike and can get injured or killed.

Raleigh is recalling 300 Technium MT 400 and 24 Technium FT 500 bicycle
frames that measure 16.5 inches from the center of the bottom of the frame to
the seat.  Bike shops and authorized Raleigh dealers sold the bicycles
nationwide from January 1993 through December 1993 for $500 to $700.  Raleigh
spokesman Pat McVey told PSL the firm initiated its own recall in May 1995
and contacted CPSC "in order to increase publicity."  CPSC compliance staffer
David Schmeltzer said firms are required under Section 15 of the Consumer
Product Safety Act to report faulty products and injuries to the agency.

Cracking mountain bicycle frames were also a problem for Cannondale, which
put stickers on all 1995 Cannondales reminding consumers to inspect their
bike frames for cracks (PSL, 1/30).  Schmeltzer said CPSC and other bike
firms have recalled bicycles for defective handlebars, suspension forks and
brakes.

Cosmic brand bicycle wheels made for road bikes by Mavic, S.A. of France and
its distribution facility in West Chester, Penn., were subjected to a Dec. 21
recall.  The firm discovered the front wheel hub may fracture and cause the
spokes to come loose resulting in the driver losing control.  Though there
were no injuries reported, Cosmic Marketing Manager Chris Zigmont said the
recall was necessary.

CPSC will continue examining generic problems of hybrid and mountain bikes.
"We are concerned," Schmeltzer said, adding the agency is trying to figure
out why there have been problems with hybrid and mountain bikes.  Schmeltzer
told PSL it could be due to the kind of use the bike is subjected to or that
they are not designed to withstand abuse.

BREAKING OFF SMALL PARTS ON TOY TRUCK LEAD TO RECALL

Toy truck's driver and wheels that can break off and present choking hazard
to young children have led to the recall of 44,000 wooden toy trucks from
Division Sales of Itasca, Ill.  A spokesman told PSL the company received a
letter from customs stating the problems were discovered during a routine
exam of imported goods.

The firm will not be purchasing any more trucks from the manufacturing
company in China and will destroy any trucks it does have.  Posters in stores
will warn consumers of the potential danger.  The trucks were sold nationwide
in 86 retail and dollar stores for $1 each from December 1993 through
December 1995.

The trucks measure 5 inches long by 2 inches wide and are packaged with a
small wooden driver figure in a blue cardboard box labeled "Wood
toy...engineering truck educational toy" and were sold in six different
styles:

** two styles of dump trucks
** cement truck
** truck with a large, wooden, rotating cylinder
** truck with crane
** truck with ladder

The spokesman said there have been no consumer complaints and "other nations
with less strict standards than the U.S. may still have these toy trucks on
their shelves."  Consumers will receive a full refund upon returning the
truck.

CPSC TO RECEIVE DATA ON BATTERY ONCE DEEMED FLAWED

CPSCers will be updated on a lithium battery that once suffered from
performance problems relating to shelf life and field failure, now addressed
by Ultralife of Newark, N.Y.  An Ultralife spokesman told PSL the firm plans
on talking to CPSC because "the battery has been getting so much attention."

The U9VL Lithium Battery has a shelf life of 10 years and is for commercial
and consumer use such as electronic parking meters, wireless security
systems, portable blood analyzers, ambulatory fuse pumps, remote controls,
digital thermometers, garage door openers, clock radios and smoke detectors.
The battery meets all UL safety requirements, carries the UL component
recognition mark and meets ANSI dimensional standards.

Ultralife promotes the battery as being able to handle extreme temperatures
better than any other 9-volt battery from -40xF to 140xF.  CPSCer Jim Hoebel
said Ultralife is the first battery company to seek CPSC's feedback about a
new battery and called it a "breakthrough product."

CARPET IRRITANT VERIFICATION SOUGHT VIA MOUSE STUDIES

CPSC has identified some 100 chemicals emitted by carpets and carpet padding.
The agency is doing animal testing to determine if those substances are
pulmonary and/or sensory irritants.  The work is not intended to replicate
studies done by Anderson Labs of Dedham, Mass., which showed that certain
carpet chemicals affected mice.  When the current mouse trials are done, CPSC
likely will assess chemicals' effect on humans.

CPSC met Dec. 15 with Air Quality Sciences, which also is testing carpets for
irritants, to discuss the timing and protocols for testing.  The agency
worked with the Environmental Protection Agency and industry in developing
protocols.

OVERHEATED CANDLE HOLDERS THAT CAN SHATTER RECALLED

Glass candle holders that can overheat and shatter have been recalled by
Godinger Silver Art of Brooklyn, N.Y.  Spokesman Abe Freund told PSL the firm
learned problem from a customer who called in a minor hand injury.  The firm
then tested the product in its lab and it failed.  Silver Art immediately
contacted CPSC and a recall notice was put out days later.  Freund said no
other injuries have been reported.

The "Tree Shaped 7 Light Votive Holder" measures 12.75 inches high and 13.75
inches wide at the base and was packaged with four green and three red small
glass pots that votive candles can be placed in.  Major retail department and
gift stores sold the candle holders nationwide from September 1995 through
December 1995 for $25 each.  About 19,000 silver-plated (item #1753) and
brass-plated (item #1753B) holders were recalled.

International Silver of Boston, Mass., also recalled the same product (item
#991194751) but sold it for $19 to $24 in nationwide in stores and on the
Home Shopping Network.  International Silver got seven reports of the glass
pots shattering including one in which the consumer's leg was injured.

SQUEAKER TOYS HELD UP BY CUSTOMS GET RECALLED

The Customs Service held up squeaker toys by Accoutrements of Seattle, Wash.,
from entering the U.S. since the squeaker device can separate from the toy
and pose a choking hazard for young children.  Accoutrements Assistant
Manager Stacey Jones said the firm has never received a complaint about the
toy in its five-year history and this was a "just in case" precaution the
firm decided to take.

The pickle toys sold for 35 cents from August 1991 through November 1995 while
the $2.50 kangaroo toys sold from May 1990 through November 1995 in retail,
toy, museum, chain and drug stores nationwide.  Squeak Pickles toy item S877
were sold individually from bags of 12 labeled in part "***The Coral
Line***Accoutrements***Not for children under three*** made in China."  The
green rubber pickles each measure 3.5 inches long.

Squeak Kangaroo and baby kangaroo toys, item 9394, were sold as a set and
labelled in part "**Great Motherhood***For ages three and up***Squeaking***
Kangaroo***Made in China***S.D.S. toys***."  The gray and black kangaroo is 5
inches while the baby kangaroo is 1.5 inches and fits in the kangaroo's
pouch.

TOO MANY LEAF BLOWER WARRANTEE CLAIMS ALERT RECALL

Too many customer warrantee claims for leaking leaf blower fuel tanks alerted
Tanaka America of Kent, Wash., to recall 11,000 Tanaka and Ariens leaf
blowers due to potential fire hazards.  A Tanaka America spokesman told PSL
that no injuries or complaints were reported, but the firm wanted to forge
ahead with recalling models TBL-455, TBL-500 and BB-430.  The $400 to $460
blower sold nationwide from January 1986 to December 1992.

The Japan-made leaf blower is mounted on a metal backpack frame with padded
shoulder straps, an orange fuel tank and black blower tube with name and
model numbers of the manufacturer are printed in the center of the blower's
fuel tank or on the recoil starter.

The Tanaka spokesman said he was not sure how many blowers were on the market
but that the firm is notifying consumers from its warrantee card files.
Customers are being told to make returns to any authorized Tanaka service
dealer for a free fuel tank replacement.  Only new and improved leaf blowers
are being manufactured.

RATTLES BY GYMBOREE RECALLED FOR CHOKING HAZARD

Rattles that can come apart and release a small bell and wooden pieces have
been recalled by Gymboree of Burlingame, Calif., because they could pose
choking hazards to young children.  Over 2,800 "GymRattles" infant rattles
sold from July 26 to November.

The wooden rattle is 4.5 inches long and has a circular wooden handle, and
multi-colored, cylinder-shaped cage with a small silver bell inside.  The
rattle's hang tag reads in part "GYMBOREE...GymRattle...Crafted in solid
maple wood...Recommended for ages 3 to 18 months."

The rattles sold nationwide at over 240 Gymboree stores for $8 each.
Gymboree representative, George Rodriguez, told PSL the rattle problem was
discovered by one of Gymboree's retail stores and reported to CPSC
immediately.

Though no consumer complaints were reported the firm decided to conduct the
recall to prevent any possibility of injury.  Rodriguez said Gymboree is
mostly known for its children's apparel, and the rattles make up a minute
part of the business.  The firm has asked consumers to return the rattles to
the place of purchase for a full refund.

CELLULAR PHONE CHARGERS CAN POSE ELECTRICAL SHOCK

Cellular phone charger plug prongs that can loosen and become lodged in
electrical outlets pose electrical shock hazards when consumers try removing
the prongs from the outlet.  No injuries have been reported.

Mascot Electronic of Fredrikstad, Norway, is recalling 65,800 ACH-4U cellular
phone chargers used with Nokia phones.  Nokia had received reports that the
charger's plastic cover can crack, thus leading to the plug prongs located on
the charger's back becoming loosened.  The recall applies to chargers with
date codes 9531 through 9546.  "Made in Norway," model number and date code
appear on the label affixed to the charger.

The rectangular, black, plastic charger is three inches long, 2.5 inches
wide, one inch tall and has grooves on the side.  The chargers were sold na-
tionwide from July to November under the brand names Nokia and AT&T.  Phone
dealers sold the chargers separately or as part of a basic sales package.
Mascot manufactured the chargers for Nokia.

HONG KONG PASSES NEW CONSUMER SAFETY REGULATIONS

Consumer goods in Hong Kong now will have to be "reasonably safe" under the
October 1995 Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance.  Hong Kong's Secretary for
Trade and Industry is responsible for approving safety standards and has the
authority to ban unsafe products from the marketplace.  Those violating the
new law face fines or jail.

Hong Kong's Commissioner of Customs and Excise can require responsible
parties to issue a public notice, preventing the parties from supplying or
selling unsafe products.  The commissioner can also order involved parties to
initiate a recall.

Though labs must be approved by the director general of industry, those
accredited under the Hong Kong Laboratory Scheme (HOKLAS) can issue test
certificates that demonstrate compliance with applicable standards.  Relevant
test certificates can also be issued if the lab has a memorandum of
understanding with HOKLAS.

EXTENDED PETITION PERIOD FOR CHILD RESTRAINT SEATS

Makers of portable child restraint systems will have until Sept. 1, 1996, to
comply with new size and weight requirements for test dummies.  The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said the deadline should
provide needed leadtime for firms to make necessary design changes to conform
to the new requirements.

In July 1995, a final rule amending Standard 213 added three dummies to child
restraint testing including a newborn infant, 9-month-old and 6-year-old.
The 6-month-old dummy has been removed from future testing.

NHTSA deems the new testing provisions as a more thorough evaluation of child
restraint performance.  Petitions for reconsideration should be sent to
Administrator, Room 5220, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400
Seventh Street S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 by Jan. 11.  For nonlegal issues,
contact George Mouchachoir at 202/366-4919, and for legal issues contact

          One result of the recent intense focus on the budget

          One result of the recent intense focus on the budget
battle has been that Congress has yet to pass some bills
not directly associated with the budget dispute.  The
telecommunications bill, which includes the Exon
amendment criminalizing the use of indecent language on
the Internet, probably will not be voted on for another
several weeks.  Public interest advocates are trying to
use that time to lobby against the Exon amendment.
Recent incidents such as the shutdown of access to Usenet
groups by Compuserve at the behest of German prosecutors
may play in favor of those critical of government
intervention.  As access advocate Jim Warren noted: "When
other nations' enforcers choose to inflict their
prejudices and dogmas on the global communications net,
perhaps American leaders may finally understand the
danger of what Congress is attempting with its `decency'
demands on all private and public speech and expression
if aided by any telecommunications device."

Agency Can't Glomarize Where
Disclosure May Be in Public Interest

          In a case that places some important restrictions on
an agency's ability to categorically deny the existence
of information pertaining to individuals, the D.C.
Circuit has ruled that the Customs Service acted
improperly when it told Max Holland of the Nation that it
would neither confirm or deny that it had records
concerning offers by H. Ross Perot to help the Service
with drug interdiction activities.  Circuit Court Judge
Pat Wald, writing for the court, observed that "although
Reporters Committee and the precedent of this circuit
make clear that FOIA extends only to those records which
reveal something about agency action, the mere fact that
records pertain to an individual's activities does not
necessarily qualify them for exemption.  Such records may
still be cloaked with the public interest if the
information would shed light on agency action."

          Wald pointed out that District Court Judge Charles
Richey had erred when he concluded that Holland's request
pertained only to the activities of a private citizen.
Wald noted that "as the language of the contested request
indicates, it would be disingenuous to suggest that
appellants are not interested in the actions of Perot.
Unlike the private activities in Reporters Committee and
the cases. . .from our own circuit, however, what makes
Perot's activities significant is their connection to
agency conduct.  Appellants want to find out whether
Perot offered to help a federal agency fulfill its
statutory duties to interdict drugs, and if so, how that
agency responded to his overtures.  Although Perot
himself may be a target of their investigative work,
appellants also expressed interest in the `privatization
of government functions,' particularly operations which
are covertly funded.  The district court acknowledged as
much, in stating that appellants sought to determine
whether `Customs planned to privatize certain components
of the nation's drug interdiction efforts.'  These
concerns are about `agency activity,' not just Perot's
private activities.  As such, their disclosure may serve
the public's interest in knowing `what their government
is up to.'"

          Because the Nation had identified a public interest
in the records, Wald found that Customs' use of a Glomar
response was inappropriate because it swept too broadly.
"Because the range of circumstances included in Customs'
categorical rule do not `characteristically support' an
inference that all material in law enforcement files
which names a particular individual is exempt from
disclosure to third parties, a more particularized
approach is required."  Wald noted that one alternative
was for Customs to adjust its categorical rule.  "Customs
is. . .free to articulate a revised categorical rule
regarding disclosure of law enforcement records if it can
identify more narrowly tailored circumstances under which
the balance of privacy and public interest
characteristically tips in the direction of exemption."

          The court clarified its earlier decision in Safecard
Services v. SEC, 926 F.2d 1197 (D.C. Cir. 1991), by
reining in its application.   In Safecard Services, the
court had established a categorical exemption for names
of third parties in law enforcement records unless the
information was needed to "confirm or refute compelling
evidence that the agency is engaged in illegal activity."
Wald wrote that "to the extent any information contained
in 7(C) investigatory files would reveal the identities
of individuals who are subjects, witnesses, or informants
in law enforcement investigations, those portions of
responsive records are categorically exempt from
disclosure under Safecard.  But we do not read Safecard
as permitting an agency to exempt from disclosure all of
the material in an investigatory record solely on the
grounds that the record includes some information which
identifies a private citizen or provides that person's
name and address.  Because such a blanket exemption would
reach far more broadly than is necessary to protect the
identities of individuals mentioned in law enforcement
files, it would be contrary to FOIA's overall purpose of
disclosure, and thus is not a permissible reading of
Exemption 7(C)."

          An individual's privacy expectation could also be
tempered by their voluntary disclosure of their role
documented in government files.  Wald noted that "Perot
himself has made several public statements indicating
that he has offered to aid the federal government in
hostage rescue and drug interdiction operations.
Redaction of Perot's name from any responsive documents
in the [Customs' investigatory] files that involve the
subject matter of those disclosures, if those records are
not otherwise exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7(C)
or other exemptions set forth in [Exemption 7], would not
serve any useful purpose in protecting his privacy.
Perot's decision to bring information connecting himself
with such efforts into the public domain differentiates
his privacy interest from the interest of unnamed
Safecard witnesses who did not voluntarily divulge their
identities; these public disclosures effectively waive
Perot's right to redaction of his name from documents on
events that he has publicly discussed."

          The court also found that Customs' search had been
inadequate.  Although Holland's request asked for records
indexed or cross-indexed under Perot's name, "it also
explicitly seeks information `pertaining to' Perot and
information regarding offers by Perot to assist Customs
in drug interdiction efforts. . . Accordingly,
appellants' request should be interpreted to include
subject matter files on topics of interest to appellants,
in addition to files indexed under Perot's name or
personal identifier."  Wald noted that "if we agreed with
the agency's position that appellants sought only those
records indexed under Perot's name, we might find this
search adequate.  But we have construed the scope of
appellants' request more broadly than did Customs, to
include `subject matter files.'  Customs did not describe
its recordkeeping system in sufficient detail to permit
us to identify what subject matter files, other than
those in the Privacy Act System of Records, might hold
responsive information regarding Perot's offers to help
Customs with its drug interdiction efforts.  In the
absence of this information, the agency's assertions are
too conclusory to allow de novo review of the adequacy of
its search."  (The Nation Magazine, Washington Bureau and
Max Holland v. United States Customs Service, No. 94-
5275, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit, Dec. 8, 1995)

Arkansas

Arkansas

          The supreme court has ruled that the Arkansas
Department of Human Services did not violate the
Administrative Procedure Act or the FOIA when it awarded
a contract to provide obstetrical services under a
federal waiver program.  National Park Medical Center, an
unsuccessful bidder on the contract, claimed that staff
meetings held to develop the bid solicitation violated
the open meetings requirements of the FOIA.  The court
disagreed, noting that such meetings were not the type
covered by the statute.  The court also found that
National Park failed to bring the alleged violation to
the attention of the agency before filing its court
action.  (National Park Medical Center, Inc. v. Arkansas
Department of Human Services, No. 95-411, Supreme Court
of Arkansas, Dec. 4, 1995)

Illinois

          A court of appeals has ruled that a political body
has standing to bring a suit under the Open Meetings Act,
but that the mayor of the City of Northlake failed to
file his suit against the Board of Education of School
District No. 87 within the statutory time limits.  Based
on a series of critical letters between the school board
and the mayor, the school board met in closed session --
allegedly to discuss employment matters -- to draft a
letter to the mayor in response to his recent letters.
Several months later, the mayor sued the school board for
improperly conducting a closed meeting.  On the matter of
standing, the court observed that "we find no compelling
reasons to limit the word `person' [in the Open Meetings
Act] to an individual as opposed to a body politic.
Indeed, creating an impediment to the explicit command of
the statute that actions of public bodies be taken
openly, solely on the basis that a political body is not
an individual person, ill serves the intent of the
legislature and frustrates the principles underlying the
Act.  The deterrence of official misconduct is no less
important simply because it is the office of the mayor
which challenges the infraction rather than the mayor in
his or her individual capacity."  But the court agreed
that the mayor had missed the 45-day deadline for filing
the suit.  The mayor argued that his suit was covered by
a special provision allowing a suit to be filed 45 days
after the state's attorney discovered the violation
because he had informed the state's attorney prior to
filing the suit.  The court rejected that claim, noting
that "if, as contemplated by plaintiffs, any person could
file suit as late as 45 days after the State's Attorney's
discovery of a violation the Act, then the 45-day
limitation period from the date of the meeting is
rendered superfluous."  The court added that "to allow
that same person to file suit in his or her own name
solely upon notification to the State's Attorney would,
no doubt, condone dilatory practices.  In fact, it would
confer upon persons other than the State's Attorney the
opportunity to delay filing an action ad infinitum by
simply not notifying the State's Attorney of the alleged
violation until some future date."  (Reid M. Paxson,
Mayor of the City of Northlake, v. Board of Education of
School District No. 87, Cook County, Illinois, No. 1-94-
4294, Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, Fifth
Division, Dec. 8, 1995)

Indiana

          A court of appeals has ruled that research
applications for projects involving the use of animals
are protected under an exception to the Public Records
Act pertaining to research.  The court noted that "the
application seeks information about the researcher, the
nature of the proposed or ongoing research project, and
procedures to be employed throughout the project.  The
sole subject matter of the application is a research
project and related personnel and procedures.  Even in
the narrowest sense, the information sought by the
application concerns research.  As such, it was not
subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act."
(Scott Robinson, M.D. v. Indiana University, etal., No.
49A02-9306-CV-253, Court of Appeals of Indiana, Second
District, Dec. 11, 1995)

New York

          The Court of Appeals has ruled that a list of
textbooks for courses at the State University of New York
at Farmingdale are agency records even though they are
created and maintained by a contractor.  The case
involved requests from Encore College Bookstores, a
competitor to the university-subsidized bookstore which
was run under contract by Barnes & Noble.  Encore had
initially gotten a copy of the textbook list from the
University, but after Barnes & Noble said its business
had dropped as a result, the University stopped keeping
a copy of the list.  The list was compiled by Barnes &
Noble, which gathered the information through inquiries
to professors each semester.  Both the trial court and an
appellate court had ruled that the lists were not subject
to disclosure because they were not agency records, but
the Court of Appeals disagreed.  It pointed out that the
function of the Auxiliary Service Corporation, which
operated the bookstore, was "to supply these essential
services -- including the campus bookstore -- for SUNY.
ASC's acts in discharging this delegated duty, then, are
performed on SUNY's behalf."  Applying this to the
circumstances, the court noted that "because ASC receives
a copy of the booklist compiled by its subcontractor,
Barnes & Noble, to ensure that the campus bookstore is
adequately maintained, it does so for the benefit of
SUNY, a government agency.  In other words, the booklist
information is `kept' or `held' by ASC `for an agency'.
Thus, the information falls within the unambiguous
definition of the term `records' under the [Freedom of
Information Law]."  The University urged the court to
apply the more restrictive federal standard, which, as
interpreted, requires custody and control of records.
But in rejecting that definition, the Court pointed out
that "to do so would undermine the legislative objective
to provide maximum disclosure by enabling a government
agency to insulate its records from public access by
delegating responsibility for creating or maintaining
particular information to a non-governmental entity."
However, the court went on to find that the list was
protected as commercial business information.  It noted
that "the booklist has obvious commercial value to Encore
since it would enable Encore to offer the precise
inventory that its target clientele -- SUNY-Farmingdale
students -- is required to purchase and that is currently
offered by  Barnes & Noble. . .The likelihood of harm to
Barnes & Noble is enhanced by the economic windfall
conferred upon Encore were it to receive the booklist at
the mere cost of FOIL fees.  The information in the
booklist, accumulated by virtue of the effort and expense
of Barnes & Noble, is also directly available to Encore.
Disclosure through FOIL, however, would enable Encore to
obtain the requisite information without expending its
resources, thereby reducing its cost of business and
placing Barnes & Noble at a competitive disadvantage."
(In the Matter of Encore College Bookstores, Inc. v.
Auxiliary Service Corporation of the State University of
New York at Farmingdale, No. 304, Court of Appeals of New
York, Dec. 27, 1995)

          The Court of Appeals has ruled that litigants who
prevail in exposing egregious violations of the Open
Meetings Law should be awarded attorney's fees as a
matter of course.  Ruling in a case in which the Board of
Trustees of the Village of Monticello decided at a closed
meeting to play "musical chairs" with their jobs --
rotating various village positions among themselves --
and then affirmed their prearranged plan at a subsequent
open meeting, the Court of Appeals explained that "on
this record, denial of a request for attorneys' fees
would constitute an abuse of discretion. . ."  The court
rejected the concept that attorney's fees were
appropriate only for repeated violations of the statute,
noting that "it is inconceivable that the Legislature had
only such recidivist offenders in mind when it vested
trial judges with the authority to award costs and fees
in the first place.  In fact, it is very often the
possibility of recovering costs and attorneys' fees that
gives private citizens like plaintiffs the impetus they
need to bring meritorious lawsuits to enforce the Open
Meetings Law thus advancing the statutory policy of
keeping New Yorkers better apprised of the actions of
their elected officials."  (In the Matter of Victor W.
Gordon v. Village of Monticello, Inc., No. 276, Court of
Appeals of New York, Dec. 7, 1995)

          An appellate court has ruled that the Department of
Transportation improperly withheld contract proposals
even after the contract had been awarded.  The court
noted that the winning proposal "did not include any
intra-agency confidential information which would assist
in DOT's negotiations."  It added that "once the contract
was awarded, the terms of [the winning bidder's] RFP
response could no longer be competitively sensitive.  DOT
implicitly recognized the validity of petitioner's
modified request by releasing a redacted version of [the
winning] RFP response."  The court pointed out that the
department raised the trade secrets exemption for the
first time at the appellate level, claiming that it had
no time to do so at the trial court level.  But the court
noted that "respondents, however, offer no explanation
for why DOT did not raise this exemption when it gave the
redacted version to the petitioner.  In our view, DOT
should, at that point, have given an explanation for
providing a limited version. . .Simply, this record does
not provide any basis to support respondents' position
that there was no opportunity for them to set forth the
argument that there was a trade secret exemption."  (In
the Matter of Cross-Sound Ferry Services, Inc. v.
Department of Transportation, No. 73187, Supreme Court of
New York, Appellate Division, Third Department, Dec. 7,
1995)

          An appellate court has ruled that the Saratoga
Economic Development Corporation is not a public agency
subject to the FOIL.  Although the town provided 50
percent of the Corporation's revenues, the court found
that the Corporation was not similar to the Buffalo
Enterprise Development Corporation which the Court of
Appeals had earlier ruled was a public agency.  The
appellate court noted that the Saratoga Corporation was
"an independent entity formed by private businessmen to
further their own interests. . .It has never been
furnished offices at County expense; no County employee
has ever served on its board; it receives some of its
funding from private individuals and corporations; and it
is not subject to most of the financial controls exerted
over the [Buffalo Corporation].  Significantly, while the
Court of Appeals found that the BEDC described itself as
an `agent' of the City, and that a substantial portion of
its activities consisted of the administration of loan
programs and, concomitantly, the disbursement of funds on
behalf of the City, respondent does none of these things;
rather it has simply contracted with the County on a fee-
for-service basis, much as any other independent business
entity might."  (In the Matter of Farms First v. Saratoga
Economic Development Corporation, No. 73053, Supreme
Court of New York, Appellate Division, Third Department,
Dec. 14, 1995)

Ohio

          A court of appeals has ruled that drafts of proposed
changes to the collective bargaining sections of the Ohio
Code which were prepared by or received by the Office of
Collective Bargaining must be disclosed.  The court noted
that there was no exemption for the draft records and
rejected the agency's suggestion that it adopt a
deliberative process privilege.  The court pointed out
that "even if respondents' public policy arguments may
have some merit, the legislature expresses Ohio public
records law and that statute permits no exemption for a
pre-decisional or deliberative privilege.  The General
Assembly has done all of the balancing needed in public
records law; public policy arguments should not sway our
interpretation."  (State of Ohio ex rel. District 1199,
The Health Care and Social Service Union, SEIU, AFL-CIO
v. Stephen Gulyassy, Deputy Director, No. 95APD01-26,
Court of Appeals of Ohio, Tenth Appellate District,
Franklin County, Dec. 12, 1995)

Wyoming

          After federal courts have largely shut down union
access to payrolls of federal projects to be used for
monitoring compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act, the
Wyoming Supreme Court has made clear that such records
are subject to disclosure under state law.  The
Department of Transportation argued there was no public
interest in disclosure, but the court disagreed, noting
that "the [plaintiffs] demonstrate the information can be
used to audit WTD's, the [Federal Highway
Administration's], and contractors' efforts to comply
both with federal requirements for a prevailing wage
rate, as well as with Wyoming's parallel statutory
requirements.  For that reason alone, any countervailing
interest of the workers in their privacy is outweighed by
a public interest."  The court rejected the claim that
disclosure was an invasion of privacy.  It explained that
"the argument relies almost entirely on construction of
a federal exemption which is not found in Wyoming's
public records act.  However, we are persuaded the record
makes no suggestion that affected employees have
complained about the potential of such a release, nor
would it be likely such complaints, if made, could
overcome the mandate of the public records act to release
information.  This is especially so because the workers
have already released their names and addresses to the
contractor, who has in turn released them to the State of
Wyoming, who has in turn released that information to the
federal government.  There is no indication in the record
that if the [plaintiffs] did contact the workers at their
homes that such would be significantly disruptive of
their privacy.  The record simply does not provide any
basis for denying release of the contested information."
(Wyoming Department of Transportation v. International
Union of Operating Engineers Local Union 800, No. 95-47
and No. 95-48, Supreme Court of Wyoming, Dec. 22, 1995)

        Ontario Government Proposes Changes to FOI,

        Ontario Government Proposes Changes to FOI,
                  Privacy Statutes

          Ontario entered the world of access and privacy in
the latter 1980s with a carefully constructed statute
that combined access and privacy.  The statute created
the Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner and
was generally seen as one of the most progressive
statutes of its kind.  While Ontario has had its share of
knotty problems under the statute, the law has generally
stood the test of time and the Office of the Information
and Privacy Commissioner has emerged as a leader in its
thoughtful and capable implementation and analysis of the
statute.  But Ontario recently underwent a sweeping
change in political direction and now it seems almost
certain that the Freedom of Information and Protection of
Privacy Act and the Municipal Freedom of Information and
Protection of Privacy Act will be subjected to major
structural changes in the name of more efficient
government.

          An omnibus bill, the centerpiece of the province's
new "Common Sense Revolution," was introduced in the
legislature in late November and was slated for approval
by mid-December, all with very little legislative or
public debate.  However, after a sit-in by opposition
members, public hearings were scheduled.  The legislative
committee considering the omnibus bill was divided in
half, with one half dealing solely with healthcare
amendments and the other half dealing with everything
else.

          The amendments to the freedom of information and
protection of privacy statutes introduce the concept of
an application fee for the first time.  While the federal
Access to Information Act has always included a $5
application fee, the provincial acts have largely treated
such fees as barriers to access and have never provided
for them.  However the new fees, which will be set by
regulation, will apply not only to general information,
but to personal information as well, blurring the
distinction that is made in the federal acts where
personal information requests are not subject to an
application fee.  In another break with tradition, the
amendments will also require an application fee for
appealing an agency's determination to the Office of the
Information and Privacy Commissioner.  The amendments
will also increase fees for search time, costs of
preparing a record for disclosure, and computer and other
costs associated with locating, retrieving, processing,
and copying a record; the amendments also provide for
shipping costs and any other costs incurred in responding
to a request.

          The final significant change will allow agencies to
refuse requests that are considered frivolous or
vexatious.  While multiple or large-scale requests have
sometimes been seen by agencies as frivolous and
vexatious, Information and Privacy Commissioner Tom
Wright ruled this past summer directly on the issue as a
way of setting some guidelines for making such
determinations.  While Wright had decided that the issue
needed addressing on its own merits, part of the
rationale for dealing with the issue was to provide
guidance which would result in consistent treatment of
such requests.  While Wright realized that one agency's
idea of what constituted a frivolous request could well
be another requester's idea of a perfectly legitimate
inquiry, he carefully restrained his decision to deal
with those instances where the request was a clear abuse
of process.  Part of the fear that such determinations
can be made on an agency-by-agency basis is the potential
that such determinations might be abused for no more
legitimate a reason than that the agency did not want to
incur the time or cost involved in responding to a
request.  The new amendment allows a requester whose
request has been rejected as being frivolous or vexatious
to appeal to the Commissioner; ironically, such appeals
will be free.

          While many governments, including the U.S.
government and many state governments, are in the throes
of budget-cutting battles, Ontario is the first
jurisdiction where freedom of information and privacy
protections have been singled out for reductions early in
the game.   On the federal level in the U.S.,
implementation of such statutes has often been given low
priority and agencies struggle with inadequate budgets
and staff, but Congress has not moved to trim them as
statutory rights.  If the current Ontario government
actually views these potential changes as a way to
increase revenues, experience shows clearly that such a
goal is very unlikely.  The nearly certain result of the
proposed changes will be to lower the number of requests,
which, in turn, may save institutions money if their
workloads become small enough that staff can be let go or
moved to another office.  The addition of an application
fee for personal information is likely to impact the
privacy rights of individuals to an even greater extent
than will application fees for information requested by
subject matter.  Not only will individuals pay a fee to
access their personal information, other related rights,
particularly the right of correction or amendment, will
be affected as well.  Since most individuals will not
know if their files are incorrect until they have
actually seen them, corrections will occur only after
access is made pursuant to the new fee regulations.
Since this aspect of fair information practices is based
on the assumption that individuals are in a position to
be most knowledgeable about the accuracy of their
personal information and most concerned about ensuring
accuracy, the entire system is premised on the ability of
individuals to access their files.  Roadblocks
represented by fees may undermine that premise.

          While access advocates are fond of making the
connection between principles of participatory democracy,
freedom of speech and press, and the need for citizen
access to government information, no court has ever quite
made that leap of faith.  But that doesn't mean the
connection doesn't exist.  When governments take measures
that denigrate the ability of citizens to inquire about
their government for no other reason than to save money
or make government more "efficient," that government has
put a pricetag on that aspect of democracy.  Such actions
are likely to have two results.  The first is that fewer
people will participate in the scheme of access and
debate on a societal level will be incrementally more
uninformed.  The other result of fees in such statutes is
to further exacerbate the chasm between economic haves
and economic have-nots.  Those entities, primarily
business, which can easily absorb the fees and realize
that government information is still a bargain in the
commercial market will continue to access government
information and reap the potential benefits.  Those who
are driven by grassroots activism or mere personal
curiosity will begin to drop out of the race or at least
think twice before plunging ahead with a request.  If
information is truly power, the fostering of divisions
along economic, class or political lines ultimately has
consequences that resonate throughout a democratic
society.

ACCESS REPORTS/FREEDOM OF INFORMATION via NewsNet
January 3, 1996

          The D.C. Circuit has ruled that the Secret Service

          The D.C. Circuit has ruled that the Secret Service
properly withheld records concerning the breakup of a
meeting of computer hackers at the Pentagon City Mall by
mall security under Exemption 7(C) (invasion of privacy
concerning law enforcement records) and Exemption 7(D)
(confidential sources). However, it told the Secret
Service to show that the sources had been promised
confidentiality.  Although the agency said it routinely
treated source information as confidential, the court
pointed out that "the manner in which an agency
`routinely' handles information is not sufficient to
establish an implied assurance of confidentiality as to
any particular source."  It then noted that "the Service
offered no evidence that a fear of retaliation by hackers
is sufficiently widespread to justify an inference that
sources of information relating to computer crimes expect
their identities and the information they provide to be
kept confidential."  The agency was able to establish
that at least one source had explicitly requested
confidentiality.  Ironically, it wasn't until the D.C.
Circuit issued its opinion that the plaintiffs --
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility -- even
knew there was more than one source.   As to 7(C), the
court took a hardline position that virtually any mention
of an individual in law enforcement records gave rise to
a privacy expectation.  CPSR pointed out that "the
records also contain information relating to individuals
who attended the meeting of the 2600 Club" and argued
that "the exemption does not authorize the Service to
withhold this information because, it its view, no stigma
could attach to persons who `were engaged in wholly
lawful activity and were peaceably assembled in a public
place.'"  But the court disagreed, noting that "even if
we were to assume that the Service's records contain such
information and even if those individuals were not
suspects, their public identification with a meeting that
reportedly attracted the attention of law enforcement
officials would subject them to a degree of interest that
would impinge upon their privacy.  We conclude, then,
that Exemption 7(C) permits the Service to withhold the
names and identifying information of persons appearing in
its records so long as their privacy interest in not
being connected in any way with a criminal investigation
outweighs the public interest in disclosure."  (Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility v. United States
Secret Service, No. 94-5247, U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, Jan. 2)


          A federal judge in Maine has rejected the rationale
of Dismukes v. Dept. of the Interior and has ruled that
digitized data maintained by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration for use in electronic charting
systems was an agency record subject to disclosure.  NOAA
had argued that it was not obligated to provide the
digitized data because its paper-format charts were
already available and contained the same information.
But Judge D. Brock Hornby, wondered why "if the materials
are subject to disclosure in some format (here, the paper
charts), then why not in any other format in which they
also exist?"  He provided the agency's answer: "Expense
and inconvenience to the agency are the obvious answers,"
but noted that "Congress seems to have addressed these
concerns by providing specific measures for cost
recovery."  Noting that the Supreme Court in Dept. of
Justice v. Tax Analysts had held that agency records may
be withheld only if they are subject to an exemption,
Hornby added that "the paper charts -- information the
human eye can decode -- and the binary number strings --
instructions a computer can decode to generate an image
of a chart on a monitor -- are both agency records.  They
also each add information to the underlying raw data
about depths, shoals, buoy locations, etc., in order to
make the data more easily usable -- by eye, the mind, or
the computer.  Nothing in the FOIA excuses an agency from
disclosing a particular record because it has disclosed
the content elsewhere in a different format."  (Delorme
Publishing Company v. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration of the United States, Department of
Commerce, Civil Action No. 95-94-P-H, U.S. District Court
for the District of Maine, Dec. 11, 1995)


          The Eighth Circuit has ruled that a district court
judge improperly dismissed Jack Urban's FOIA suit for a
copy of a polygraph test he took administered by the
Kansas Bureau of Investigation and provided to the U.S.
Attorney for Kansas.  The lower court dismissed the case
based on the government's claim that it could not find
the record.  The court of appeals noted that "when a
government agency claims that it does not possess or
control a requested document, the agency must show it
fully discharged its statutory obligations by `conducting
a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant
documents.'  Thus, when the question is whether a
requested document exists, or is outside the government's
possession or control, an FOIA action is not moot, and
dismissal prior to service will almost never be
appropriate."  The court said that the response of the
Assistant U.S Attorney for Kansas that he could not
locate the records in the files of the U.S. Attorney's
office was not adequate.  The court noted that "Urban has
now spent nearly eighteen months seeking a copy of
seemingly innocuous test results.  His early requests got
no response or a cryptic brush off.  He has never been
told why he is not entitled to the documents.  And his
attempt to invoke, FOIA, a statute intended to foster
greater access to government records, has instead
fostered more paper shuffling and lame excuses."
Remanding the case to district court, the court of
appeals noted that "there may be a legitimate reason why
Urban is not entitled to the materials he requests, but
none appears in this record."  (Jack Urban v. United
States of America; Kansas Bureau of Investigation, No.
95-2386, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,
Dec. 27, 1995)


          A federal judge in New York has given the FBI a year
to respond to Wayne Pray's request.  Noting that the FBI
had a backlog of 14,055 cases as of May, 1995, Judge
Sidney Stein also indicated that there were at least
1,616 requests ahead of Pray's and that the agency was
processing requests at the rate of 19 per month.  Noting
that this would mean Pray's request would be completed in
seven years, Stein observed that "it seems inconceivable
that defendants would be requesting this Court to stay
Pray's request for seven years.  Therefore this Court is
prepared to assume that defendants' declaration contains
a typographical error, that the average of 19 cases per
month is actually 190 cases per month and that defendants
should therefore be able to comply with Pray's request in
approximately 9 months.  Because of the difficulty in
estimating time, this Court will grant defendants' motion
for a stay until December 31, 1996 or until Pray's
request is responded to, whichever is sooner."  (Wayne
Pray v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Civil Action No.
95-0380 (SHS), U.S District Court for the Southern
District of New York, Dec. 27, 1995)


          A federal court in New York has accepted a
magistrate's recommendation and found that the FBI
properly withheld records concerning the murder of Pedro
Bueno and the whereabouts of the plaintiff's wife and two
daughters.  The only record disclosed to Devernon Le
Grand was a letter from the Director of the FBI to the
National Center for Analysis of Violent Crime field
office in New York informing it that a Violent Crime
Apprehension Program (VICAP) report had been submitted
for Bueno.  In withholding the report under Exemption
7(C) (invasion of privacy concerning law enforcement
records) and Exemption 7(D) (confidential sources), the
magistrate noted that there was no public interest in the
VICAP report, but that "the administration of VICAP,
which seeks to assist state and local law enforcement
agencies in their investigations of unsolved violent
homicides, clearly involves concerns of potential
harassment of personnel and interference with law
enforcement efforts."  As to 7(D), the magistrate
observed that "the VICAP Report for Pedro Bueno was
submitted by the New York State Police to the FBI under
circumstances which support an inference of
confidentiality.  It consists of information concerning
the investigation by the New York State Police of the
Pedro Bueno homicide.  It is reasonable to infer that a
state law enforcement agency would not turn over to the
FBI all of its investigative information on an unsolved
homicide if the information were not to be treated as
confidential by the FBI."  (Devernon Le Grand v. Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Civil Action No. 94-0300, U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York,
Nov. 29, 1995)


          Judge Louis Oberdorfer has ruled that the FBI
properly invoked a series of exemptions and conducted
adequate searches in most instances in responding to a
request from Jeffrey Steinberg.  However, Oberdorfer
found that some searches were inadequate, noting that the
Charlotte and New York offices had not justified their
search for a Terrorist Photograph Album.  He pointed out
that the agency failed to address Steinberg's contention
that the album should be searched.  He noted that
"plaintiff has identified a particular document, the TPA,
that is likely to contain any responsive information that
exists . . .In this case, defendant has failed to meet
its burden of showing that its search was reasonable."
As for the search of the Richmond office for records
concerning the Dan Bar Farm, Oberdorfer noted that the
agency had alluded to a resident agent in Radford, VA,
who had information about the farm; however, the agency
told the court there was no Radford agent.  But Steinberg
produced a document from an Alexandria agent stating that
an agent under Richmond's supervision had information
about the farm.  Steinberg suggested the agency contact
the Alexandria agent and find out who the "missing" agent
was.  Although the agency claimed to do so would be
tantamount to conducting research, Oberdorfer noted that
"it is not unreasonable to require defendant to obtain a
single redacted name and make a single phone call to
clarify defendant's mistake and discover where responsive
records, if any, are located."  (Jeffrey Steinberg v.
U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Action No. 93-2409-LFO,
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Oct.
31, 1995)


          Judge Louis Oberdorfer has ruled that the Customs
Service search for records responsive to a request from
Jeffrey Steinberg was inadequate.  Oberdorfer noted that
"although defendant has stated in conclusory terms that
[the Treasury Enforcement Communications System] is used
to locate investigative files and is, to its mind,
comprehensive, defendant has failed to explain or even to
state, `that no other record system was likely to produce
responsive documents.'"  He pointed out that Steinberg
had produced a list of 18 possible systems of records
that might have responsive records.  He noted that
"plaintiff has shown that it is reasonable to conclude
that additional systems exist and that TECS does not
include these systems.  Plaintiff has shown that it would
not be `unduly burdensome' to search these systems, given
that they are organized alphabetically."  To further
clarify the search issue, Oberdorfer ordered the agency
to respond to Steinberg's interrogatories.  (Jeffrey
Steinberg v. U.S. Department of the Treasury, Civil
Action No. 93-2348-LFO, U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia, Sept. 13, 1995)


          A federal court in Chicago has ruled that an FOIA
suit against the Veterans Administration is not moot.
After William Johnson filed suit against the VA, the
agency disclosed records responsive to his request.
However, Johnson continued to contend that it had not
provided all the requested information.  Refusing to
dismiss the case, Judge Suzanne Conlon noted that "while
the medical center denies the existence of the
information in issue, Johnson asserts that his
conversations with the medical center's pharmacy indicate
otherwise.  The Seventh Circuit views conflicting claims
as to the existence of documents or information as a form
of improper withholding.  Accordingly, the case is not
moot."  (William J. Johnson, Sr. v. Veterans
Administration, Civil Action No. 95 C 4909, U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
Division, Dec. 6, 1995)

          A federal judge in Michigan has ruled that the IRS
properly refused to honor a subpoena requiring testimony
of a special agent and production of documents pertinent
to an ongoing law enforcement investigation.
Acknowledging that he was not dealing with an FOIA
request, Judge Gerald Rosen nevertheless found that FOIA
case law was instructive in reaching a conclusion.
Relying on the Sixth Circuit's decision in Dickerson v.
Dept. of Justice, 992 F.2d 1426 (6th Cir. 1993), which
upheld the Justice Department's decision to withhold all
its files on the Jimmy Hoffa investigation, Rosen noted
that "the level of justification demanded from an agency
when it refuses to disclose information surely must
depend on the nature of the materials sought and their
relation to any ongoing criminal investigations.  The
materials sought by Plaintiffs go to the very heart of
the ongoing criminal investigation of the Plaintiffs."
He concluded that "the subpoena issued in connection with
Plaintiffs' state court action seeks testimony and
materials that are central to an ongoing IRS criminal
investigation.  The District Director reasonably
determined that compliance with this subpoena would
seriously impair federal tax administration."  (Branch
International Services, Inc., etal. v. United States of
America and Internal Revenue Service, Civil Action No.
94-CV-75003-DT, U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Michigan, Southern Division, Nov. 29, 1995)


          A federal court in Minnesota has ruled that Steve
Netzman cannot have access to IRS information concerning
charges or penalties filed against Philip French.  The
court found that the records were "tax information"
covered by Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The judge noted that the Haskell Amendment -- which
"precludes from exemption data in a form which cannot be
associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or
indirectly, a particular taxpayer -- was the only
exception to non-disclosure under 6103.  He pointed out
that the records Netzman was requesting consisted of
"information which relates directly to a particular
individual and, therefore, is not subject to the Haskell
Amendment."  (Steve Netzman v. Internal Revenue Service,
Civil Action No. 3-95-248, U.S. District Court for the
District of Minnesota, Third Division, Nov. 21, 1995)


          A federal judge in New Hampshire has ruled that the
IRS properly withheld records from Terrence Bennett.
Judge Paul Barbadoro pointed out that "the documents
refer to information exchanged pursuant to a tax treaty.
The Service reasonably concluded that the disclosure of
such documents would chill future cooperation with
foreign government treaty partners.  Therefore, it is
entitled to withhold the documents on the ground that
their disclosure would seriously impair federal tax
administration."  (Terrence M. Bennett v. Internal
Revenue Service, Civil Action No. 95-73-B, U.S. District
Court for the District of New Hampshire, Nov. 8, 1995)


          A federal court in California has ruled that data on
which the Department of Health and Human Services relied
to show that the Loma Linda Community Hospital had over-
represented the number of Medicare patients it served
should not have been withheld based on the Privacy Act.
The Department claimed that only 14.77 percent of Loma
Linda's Medicare patients qualified as low-income.  To
defend itself against the charges, Loma Linda requested
access to the underlying data, claiming that its
disclosure would be a routine use under the Privacy Act.
The court found that Loma Linda was entitled to see the
data because it had already had access to the
confidential information contained in it in order to make
its own calculations under the state Medi-Cal program.
The court noted that "the policy underlying the Privacy
Act of protecting confidential information from
disclosure is not implicated in this particular factual
situation.  Even if release of the data relied upon by
the [Health Care Financing Administration] in making its
calculation had unexpectedly included information not
already known to Loma Linda, a confidentiality order
could have been imposed to protect the privacy interests
in issue."  (Loma Linda Community Hospital v. Donna
Shalala, Civil Action No. ED-CV-940055-RT and ED-CV-
940068-RT, U.S. District Court for the Central District
of California, Dec. 15, 1995)


          The report on the state of access to public records
prepared by former House Government Information
Subcommittee counsel Bob Gellman has been published in
Government Information Quarterly.  The paper, entitled
"Public Records -- Access, Privacy and Public Policy: A
Discussion Paper," is reprinted at 12 Government
Information Quarterly, p. 391-426.

CONGRESS DAILY via NewsNet
January 2, 1996

Dole Says `Enough Is Enough,' Urges 7 To 10-Day CR

      Contending that "enough is enough," Senate Majority Leader
Dole today said Congress should pass a seven- to 10-day
continuing resolution to reopen the entire federal government. "I
think we've made our point," Dole told reporters, saying the
House and Senate should pass a "clean" CR lasting up to a week
and a half, while budget negotiations continue. "There are not
too many wealthy people working for the federal government," Dole
said, referring to employees who are not being paid. He said he
also is concerned that without immediate legislation, various
"expiring provisions" of federal law will prohibit some states
from providing certain services. He said, for example, some
states may not be able to send out unemployment checks.

      Dole said he would discuss the CR proposal with House
Speaker Gingrich later today. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader
Daschle said this afternoon Democrats would again attempt to
offer a clean CR in the Senate later today and that given Dole's
support, he hoped Gingrich would go along with the proposal. But
House members are likely to stick to their position that a CR
should only be passed as part of an overall budget deal, House
Appropriations Chairman Livingston told CongressDaily. "I
honestly don't believe that a straight CR would pass over here,"
he said, adding that he sympathizes with Dole's position. "I want
to get the government going," he said. A House Republican
leadership aide said, "The last time we gave [President Clinton]
a CR, he didn't even come to the table for a month, so it doesn't
give us much incentive to do it again."

      The aide said tonight's White House budget meeting is
expected to be the first time the negotiators try to resolve the
larger issues. "We'll see how serious they are," the aide said,
adding that decisions on whether the House tries to override
presidential vetoes of the Commerce-Justice-State, VA-HUD and
Interior appropriations bills depends -- in part -- on whether
the Clinton administration bargains in good faith. Livingston
agreed, saying, "The shape and content of the discussion will
have great bearing on what we do over the next few days." Clinton
early today met for two hours with his budget advisers to discuss
strategy for today's negotiating sessions, which could go late
into the evening, Press Secretary Michael McCurry said. When
asked if the president would support a CR that sends all federal
employees back to work without pay, McCurry said, "It's better
than nothing, but not much better than nothing."

      On a related front, the administration has barely started
to piece together the FY97 budget the president is supposed to
present to Congress by Feb. 5 because the final form of the FY96
budget is unknown. An administration official said the president
normally would be making final decisions on the FY97 budget this
time of the year if an FY96 budget were in place. Administration
budget officials need to know final figures for FY96
appropriations and any planned changes in entitlement spending
formulas before they can craft a new budget, the official said.

GOP Leaders To Meet Wed. On Proposed Telco Changes

      At a joint House and Senate leadership meeting scheduled
for Wednesday morning, Senate Majority Leader Dole and House
Speaker Gingrich are expected to try to iron out a final
compromise on four or five outstanding issues in
telecommunications reform legislation, sources said today. The
issues include foreign ownership, price regulation, and broadcast
ownership. Spectrum sales, an issue Dole brought up again last
week, may also be raised, sources said. Optimistically, if the
leadership can settle these issues, the telecommunications
conference agreement could go to the House floor Thursday. It
could then be brought to a vote in the Senate on Friday or early
next week, sources said, while cautioning, "But we've all heard
that before."

      The most recent version of an agreement put together by the
four conference leaders dropped a provision that would have
relaxed foreign ownership restrictions for U.S. communications
firms. House Commerce Trade and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee
Chairman Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, is working to reinstate the
provision, strongly opposed by Senate Commerce ranking member
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. The regional Bell operating companies
have sought "price regulation" of their services to replace the
current system of "rate of return" regulation, which caps the
amount of profits the RBOCs can earn. Also, some conferees want
to loosen broadcast ownership restrictions for the number of
properties held by one owner. And Dole has sought to charge
broadcasters for the purchase of spectrum as a revenue raiser.

House Panels Seeking Superfund Financing Alternatives

      With a rebate to private parties for Superfund cleanups a
target of fierce political attacks, the House Commerce and
Transportation and Infrastructure panels are seeking alternatives
for financing the program, panel sources said. Among the
proposals are further exemptions from liability for new classes
of Superfund sites, a Transportation and Infrastructure source
added. Transportation and Infrastructure Water Resources and
Environment Subcommittee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., last
month said the rebate -- called the retroactive liability
discount -- will be dropped from the Superfund reform legislation
he is sponsoring with Commerce Trade and Hazardous Materials
Subcommittee Chairman Michael Oxley, R-Ohio. "There is general
agreement that it won't survive," Boehlert said.

      Democrats and environmental groups derided the RLD plan as
a "pay-the-polluter" giveaway and a costly new entitlement.
Boehlert said Democrats were able to target the RLD to portray
the Superfund legislation as an attack on the environment. As
approved by Oxley's subcommittee in November, the RLD would cover
50 percent of the cleanup cost at Superfund sites and would be
paid out of the Superfund trust fund. Bill sponsors proposed the
RLD as an alternative to exempting from cleanup liability
altogether sites polluted before the Superfund law went into
effect in 1980. Oxley said repealing retroactive liability would
be too expensive, and that the RLD would reduce liability
litigation and get more money into cleanups.

      To replace the RLD, the committees are considering
exempting more multi-party sites from cleanup liability, the
Transportation source said. Cleanup would be financed directly
from the Superfund trust fund. The source contended adding new
exemptions for multi-party sites to the current plan would reduce
litigation costs and increase money going to cleanup by one-third
to one-half over the amount spent under current law. The bill
already would exempt municipal landfills and private oil
recycling facilities.

Sources: Osprey Exhibits Problems During Shock Tests

      The Navy's troubled efforts to improve its historically
weak ability to counter anti-ship mines suffered another setback
recently, when the first of a new type of mine-hunting ships came
unglued during simulated combat tests. During explosive shock
trials in late October, some of the interior bulkheads and
equipment platforms and decking of the coastal mine hunter Osprey
became separated from the ship's hull, according to sources
familiar with the tests. The problem appears to be a failure of
the bonding that is supposed to hold together the interior
structures and the hull, all of which are made of a special
plastic material, the sources said. One source said the problems
revealed in the Osprey could require extensive modifications that
also would have to be retrofitted, at additional cost, to the 11
other ships in the class, all of which are completed or nearly
finished.

      The damage to the Osprey is just the latest problem with a
project that ran years behind schedule and well above expected
cost. And it continues a rash of difficulties plaguing the Navy's
entire program to eliminate a war-fighting weakness that
handicapped operations in the Persian Gulf. Capt. Gordon
Peterson, a Navy spokesman, confirmed that the Osprey experienced
some damage during the trials but declined to specify how
extensive it was, citing security concerns. Peterson noted some
damage is expected during shock trials and said that "the ship
maintained the ability to maneuver, navigate and perform its war
fighting missions" at the completion of the tests. But one source
said he was told "they suffered significantly more damage than
they expected."

      Another source said the test was stopped after five
explosions, instead of the planned six shots, and repairs had to
be made between the fourth and fifth explosions. Peterson
confirmed repairs were made and the test cut short, explaining
that Navy experts decided "sufficient data was obtained" in five
shots. A government source said the Navy now is struggling over
how to correct the problems revealed in the shock trials.

House, Senate Schedule For This Week

      Both the House and Senate will adjourn momentarily at noon
Wednesday to fulfill the constitutional requirement of ending the
first session of the 104th Congress Jan. 3. When the House
returns Wednesday, it is expected to take up an override of
President Clinton's veto of the defense authorization bill.
Depending on budget negotiations, the House also may try to
override vetoes of the Interior, Commerce-Justice-State and VA-
HUD appropriations bills later this week. A bill to permit states
to operate national parks at their own expense during the
shutdown also may be brought to the floor. The Senate schedule
also will continue to reflect the negotiations.

Talks On Banking Issues Pushed Back; State Fees Still Problematic

      Budget talks on banking issues have been pushed back and
not yet rescheduled, and the issue of state bank fees is still on
the table, sources said today. At a meeting last week of House
Banking and Budget committee staff, Banking aides did not oppose
a revenue-raising provision that would require federal regulators
to collect fees for their examinations of state-chartered banks,
sources said. Staff took a more "objective" stance, saying the
committee "has never approved of a position" to collect the fees,
according to a source. In contrast, on the issue of whether to
raise the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration loans, "staff
does not recommend this as an option," one source said. State
banks already pay examination fees to state regulators, and
Banking Chairman Leach wrote to the Budget Committee last month
urging budget negotiators not to accept the fee provision,
included in the administration's budget proposal.

Union Asks Congress To Contribute Pay To Furloughed Workers

      The National Treasury Employees Union is asking members of
Congress to donate pay they receive during the partial government
shutdown to furloughed federal workers through the Federal
Employee Education and Assistance Fund. In a letter to Congress
Friday, the NTEU called it an "outrage" that Congress, "who
caused this shutdown crisis by not passing the necessary
appropriations bills on time, have been on vacation for the
holiday and will receive no reduction in pay due to the
furlough." The union also said it will file a temporary
restraining order with a federal court asking that the law
requiring federal employees to work without pay be declared
unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Rep. Charles Taylor, R-N.C., offered
Saturday to make available about $10,000 a month from his own pay
for emergency, no-interest loans to furloughed federal workers,
the Associated Press reported. "I know I can't help everyone, but
at least I can get some people through the crisis times," Taylor
said.

Gingrich Admits Mistakes In First Year As Speaker

      Looking back at his first year as speaker of the House and
leader of the Republican revolution, House Speaker Gingrich
acknowledged Saturday that he has made some mistakes and will try
to correct them by confining himself to doing only his job. The
jump from back bench bomb-thrower to key policy decision-maker
caused some errors of inexperience, Gingrich said. "Nobody could
go from being minority whip of the House to the speaker of the
House in one jump and go from being in the opposition party to
working with [Senate Majority Leader] Dole and being really the
dominant agenda-setting force in the country [...] and not make
mistakes," Gingrich said on CNN's "Evans and Novak."

      Among the errors Gingrich noted was linking his treatment
on Air Force One to taking a hard line with President Clinton on
shutting down the government. "There's no question that there are
times, as I've described it, where it's like throwing an
interception straight into the other team's defense. And on
several occasions, and that's one, I did things that weren't
right," Gingrich said. The controversy surrounding his original
acceptance of a $4.5 million book advance also could have been
avoided, he added, by taking advice from people "who understood
being a national figure in the way I frankly didn't understand."

      Gingrich said a major way of avoiding self-inflicted wounds
this year will be to keep to his job as speaker and stop
freelancing as social commentator. Several times in the last year
and a half Gingrich has linked breaking news stories -- like
Susan Smith's murder of her two children in South Carolina -- to
a breakdown of civilization caused by liberal policies. "You
know, I'm speaker of the House. I'm not an assistant professor of
history. I'm not an analyst. I'm not a commentator. And I think
at times I've tried to play other roles, and it's almost always
been wrong," Gingrich said. "I've got to be the speaker of the
House and leader of the House Republican Party and stay inside
that particular box to be effective." Gingrich, however, has said
debate and teaching are the only ways to achieve the broad
cultural goals of conservatives.

      Gingrich also attributed his low poll ratings to how he is
covered by the media. "If I were the person who was seeing seven-
second sound bites, I wouldn't like me either," he said. But he
added that over time, "as people see more of what we're really
doing [...] my ratings will go up." Gingrich also made something
of a New Year's resolution to engage more with individual
reporters and editors in an effort to improve the Republican
revolution. "I'm going to work harder at interacting with
individual editors and reporters to see if we can't get our story
through if by no other means than just embarrassing them into
being professional," he said.

Washington Pundits

   Some observations by Washington experts and pundits on the
ongoing budget battle, as quoted late last week by Reuters:
    "Everyone thought Congress wouldn't leave town for Christmas
with the government shut down because it would look terrible. We
were wrong."

       -- Stanley Collender, a former Hill aide who is now the
in-house budget expert at Price Waterhouse.

       "You have a conflict of issues more fundamental than most
people think. This isn't just children squabbling. This is a real
difference between the way the Republicans in Congress and
Clinton want to take the country."

       -- Stephen Moore, budget analyst at the Cato Institute,
who said the standoff "will probably be ended in the next few
weeks [...] but it could last several months."

       "Custer presumably thought he would win at Little Big
Horn, too."

       -- Political analyst Kevin Phillips -- suggesting that the
Republicans had trapped themselves rhetorically, but are yet to
realize it.

Senate Approves CR; Budget Talks To Continue Today

      As late-night White House budget talks produced "progress"
but no final deal, the Senate Tuesday hedged its bets and passed
a continuing resolution to reopen the federal government as well
as a backup measure to bring federal employees back to work
without pay if, as it appears, the House refuses to approve the
new CR immediately. President Clinton and Hill leaders met from
about 6:15 p.m. (EST) to 9:15 p.m. (EST) Tuesday at the White
House, but did not announce any new agreements on the budget or a
CR afterward. Instead, the participants, continuing their efforts
to keep the budget negotiations behind closed doors, left without
talking to reporters and issued a one-sentence joint statement
said to have been authored by Vice President Gore. The statement
declared, "Our talks continue to make constructive progress and
we will reconvene tomorrow at 1:30 p.m."

      White House Press Secretary Michael McCurry said today's
meeting would be at the White House. Among the participants in
the meeting with Clinton Tuesday night were House Speaker
Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Dole, Senate Minority Leader
Daschle, House Majority Leader Armey, House Minority Leader
Gephardt, Gore and White House Chief of Staff Panetta. After
spending 90 minutes in the Oval Office, the negotiators moved to
the White House residence to continue talks over a dinner of
pasta and shrimp. Meawhile, the Senate earlier Tuesday evening
approved a "clean" continuing resolution that simply extends the
now-expired CR until Jan. 12. Dole appeared on the Senate floor,
shortly after meeting in the afternoon (EST) with House and
Senate Republican leaders for more than two hours, to make
several unanimous consent requests, including one to pass the new
CR. Most programs would be funded at the lowest of House, Senate
or FY95 funding levels. Technically, the CR was added to
legislation that would provide most favored nation status to
Bulgaria.

      In a floor statement, Dole declared, "People have been gone
from their jobs long enough."

      He said while some House Republicans want to refuse to pass
a new CR until a budget deal is set, "I don't quite understand
the logic in all that." And Dole said federal employees "want to
work," adding: "They're caught in the middle. They're pawns [...]
If there's any point to be made, it should have been made by
now."

      While Gingrich refused to consider the possibility of a new
CR until he saw how Tuesday night's budget talks progressed, Dole
denied there was a split between himself and the speaker, but
agreed "there are some differences" between House and Senate
Republicans on "how we should proceed."

      Asked later if he was trying to pressure the House to pass
the CR, Dole said: "Me? No."

      Gingrich speaking with reporters on Capitol Hill declined
to discuss the Senate action Tuesday evening, saying, "I don't
have any comment." And Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley termed
the Senate action as "a tactical judgment for the Senate."

      Talking with reporters in the Oval Office later Tuesday
before the meeting with Clinton, Gingrich said, "Our members will
be back by noon (EST) tomorrow, and we hope to meet with all of
them and brief them on tonight's meeting and whatever happens
tomorrow morning, and maybe get something done during the day
tomorrow." "I think if we can both get movement on the balanced
budget and get the government back to work, and paid for, that
really would be a good step in the right direction," Gingrich
added.

      House Budget Chairman Kasich said it is "very unlikely" the
House would pass a CR until a budget deal is set, adding, "We see
all this as being connected to balancing the budget."

      Anticipating that the House may refuse to consider the new
continuing resolution, the Senate, by unanimous consent Tuesday,
also amended and passed separate House legislation that would
bring federal employees back to work without pay, but with the
guarantee they would eventually be paid.

      The legislation in effect declares all federal employees
"essential."

      In addition, the Senate amended the legislation to provide
targeted funding to several programs, which Dole said could not
continue without the funding.

      Those programs include the federal Meals on Wheels program
for the elderly, child protection services, unemployment
compensation for 11 states, passport offices, programs for native
Americans, certain veterans programs and national parks.

      The Senate also deleted a House provision that would
require the Senate to consider any budget deal on an expedited
basis. However, Dole also requested, and received, unanimous
consent that if Daschle agrees at the time, any budget deal be
considered as budget reconciliation legislation and be subject to
the same limits. Those limits would prohibit a filibuster and
limit debate to a maximum of 20 hours. "That would speed up the
process considerably," Dole said. Because the Senate amended the
House-passed "essential" employees proposal, it apparently would
have to be reconsidered by the House before it would be sent to
Clinton.

      Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Tuesday applauded Dole's efforts
to reopen the federal government, saying, "This is a major step
forward."

      In addition, Senate Budget Chairman Domenici, commenting on
the CR said: "I think it's time we do this [...] Most federal
employees are saying they'd like to work to be paid [...] I hope
the House gives serious consideration to this."

      On another front, as public officials continue to feel the
heat from their constituents over the government shutdown, Rep.
Martin Hoke, R-Ohio, Tuesday announced he donated his $11,133
congressional pay for the month of December to 28 northeast Ohio
charities. Hoke in a statement called his decision a "matter of
conscience."

Oxley Wants To Head House Commerce Telco Panel

      There seems to be some dissension in the GOP over who will
chair the House Commerce Telecommunications and Finance
Subcommittee in the next Congress. Last week, newly converted
Republican Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin of Louisiana, in announcing
he will not run for the open Senate seat in his state this year,
also reportedly said he is the anointed chairman-in-waiting for
the subcommittee after its current chairman, Rep. Jack Fields, R-
Texas, retires later this year. But sources Tuesday said Tauzin's
news came as a surprise to the panel's current second-ranking
Republican, Rep. Michael Oxley of Ohio. "Mr. Oxley intends to be
the next chair of the telecommunications subcommittee," said
Peggy Peterson, his spokeswoman, adding, "He is currently the
vice chairman, and he is pursuing the chairmanship."

      Tauzin last week told reporters Speaker Gingrich promised
him the Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee chairmanship
in the next Congress. When he switched parties, the Republican
leadership agreed to retain Tauzin's seniority in the House.
Tauzin said he would not usurp a "sitting" chairman. In his ninth
congressional term, Tauzin has four years on Oxley and two years
on Commerce Chairman Bliley.

      Asked if Oxley had discussed the matter with Gingrich,
Peterson had no comment. However, she said: "Mr. Oxley does not
think that Republicans are the party of seniority. Seniority is
only one factor in picking a chair."

      Ever since Tauzin made his remarks, sources on and off
Capitol Hill have speculated about whether the reports were
accurate and, if so, why the speaker would make such a deal.

      Some close to the matter said Gingrich hoped Tauzin's plum
spot would lure other senior Democrats over to the GOP, and
strengthen the Republican position in the House.

      The speaker's office did not return several inquiries from
CongressDaily Tuesday.

      Technically, under House Rule 19, the speaker does not
appoint subcommittee chairmen, staff noted. The chairman of the
full committee proposes a leadership slate that must be ratified
by the majority members of the committee, they said. The House
Commerce Committee spokesman had no comment on the matter.

      Oxley intends to file for re-election in his district
Friday, according to his staff.

Roberts Seems Reluctant To Extend Food Aid Programs

   House Agriculture Chairman Roberts appears to be resisting
writing an extension of authority for the Food for Peace and Food
for Progress programs, which provide food to poor countries,
including war-torn Bosnia.

      Authority for the two food programs expired Dec. 31, along
with the rest of the 1990 farm bill. The vetoed GOP budget
reconciliation bill would have reauthorized agricultural
programs, including the international food assistance programs,
but the reauthorization has been tied up in the ongoing budget
negotiations.

      A Roberts spokeswoman Tuesday said the Clinton
administration has not "conveyed to us that there is a particular
problem" regarding the two food programs, adding, "Our effort is
strictly working on the balanced budget."

      But a farm organization lobbyist speculated the underlying
reason probably is that Roberts does not want to break out any
pieces of the farm bill reauthorization that are contained in the
budget reconciliation bill.

      Agency for International Development Administrator Brian
Atwood, Agriculture Secretary Glickman and House International
Relations Chairman Gilman have been pushing Roberts to extend the
program since mid-December, when it became apparent no budget
agreement would be reached before the 1990 farm bill expired.

      Atwood and Glickman both wrote Roberts and other Hill
officials Dec. 13 asking for an extension, and Gilman planned to
introduce it before Christmas. However, Roberts insisted on
obtaining another letter from Glickman explaining the situation
was an emergency. The second Glickman letter was held up for
clearance at the White House, but arrived at the House
Agriculture Committee Tuesday morning.

      The letter states that "any lapse in authority could
seriously undermine the ability of the United States to meet the
needs, particularly emergency needs of vulnerable populations,
and to augment food supplies in food-deficit countries."

      Nevertheless, Agriculture Committee staff director Gary
Mitchell Tuesday through a spokeswoman said the letter was not
specific enough to require action.

      Commenting on the turn of events, a House International
Relations Committee staffer Tuesday said: "We felt that there was
so much agreement to go ahead and do this anyway that there
wasn't a need to go through the specific contracts. We're talking
about a program to feed starving people. If they need specifics,
we'll get specifics."

      In addition, Atwood told CongressDaily he does not think
Roberts needs more specifics to act. "I think a request by Dan
Glickman and me citing that OMB has no objections is clarity
enough. We really need the clear support of Congress and need
their authorization to deliver food in emergency circumstances,"
Atwood said. Atwood said he had a good relationship with Roberts
and believes Roberts "is thinking about this not in partisan but
legislative, tactical terms. I think the approach he is taking is
a risky one and I hope that he would reconsider."

A Third Of Calif. Delegation In Play As Filing Closes

     Filing for the March 26 California primary closed late
Friday, and while there will be no megabucks Senate race in the
Golden State this year, there will be competitive races in at
least a third of the state's 52-member House delegation.

      The California congressional elections this year are
complicated by several minor party candidates who are largely
conservative and could draw enough votes away from Republicans to
affect some close races.

      This is the first year the Natural Law Party and Ross
Perot's Reform Party have qualified as official parties, while
the Libertarian Party has fielded candidates in the past.

      For example, Libertarian candidate Ross Crain took 4
percent of the vote against Democratic Rep. Vic Fazio in 1994 and
9 percent against Fazio in 1992; Fazio won only 50 percent of the
vote in 1994, and 51 percent in 1992, while the GOP nominees and
Crain divided the conservative vote in the Sacramento area seat.

      As a chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Fazio is one
of the GOP's top House targets this year. But Republicans could
encounter a bitter primary battle for the right to oppose Fazio
between 1994 nominee Tim LeFever, a conservative, and Esparto
school board member Charles Schaupp, a moderate.

      The LeFever-Schaupp ideological battle has split GOP
central committees in two of the district's counties, resulting
in attempts to remove people from those panels.

      While Fazio is the GOP's most prominent California target,
his is but one of up to eight Democratic-held seats being eyed by
the Republicans.

      In the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles, where
Democratic Rep. Anthony Beilenson is retiring, Richard Sybert, a
former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, is expected to emerge as the
winner of a three-way GOP primary.

      Sybert, who owns a toy manufacturing company and can tap
into his family fortune, spent $1.6 million in 1994 to win 48
percent against Beilenson.

      Leading a field of five Democrats is Brad Sherman, who has
twice won elections to represent the Los Angeles area on the
state's four-member tax board. Sherman also has family wealth on
which to rely.

      On the southern side of the Los Angeles area, Democratic
Rep. Jane Harman faces the prospect of a rematch against 1994 GOP
nominee Susan Brooks, who lost to Harman by a mere 812 votes.
After the election, Brooks pursued a legal challenge claiming
election irregularities, including that illegal aliens voted.

      Torrance businessman and physician Irwin Savodnik has filed
to challenge Brooks in the primary.

      Another prime GOP target is Democratic Rep. George Brown,
ranking member of the Science Committee, who edged GOP candidate
Robert Guzman by just 51-49 in 1994. Guzman is again seeking the
GOP nod, but so are four other candidates. Widely regarded as the
front-runner in the primary is Linda Wilde, a state Superior
Court judge who has taken a leave of absence to run.

      Included in the next tier of GOP targets are two
conservative Democrats from the state's Central Valley, Reps.
Gary Condit and Calvin Dooley, as well as two northern California
liberals, Reps. Sam Farr and Anna Eshoo.

      Three Republicans have signed up to challenge Farr, who
holds White House Chief of Staff Panetta's former House seat. The
would-be nominees against Farr, who won just 52 percent in 1994,
include Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau Director Jess Brown.

      Eshoo appears more secure: She was re-elected with 61
percent in a difficult year for Democrats. Her 1994 opponent, Ben
Brink, is one of two candidates seeking the GOP nod this year.

      Challenging Condit, a leader of The Coalition, will be
Republican Bill Conrad, a general contractor who has never held
elective office. Condit won his 1994 race by a 2-1 margin,
although GOP nominees for governor and senator won the district.

      Three Republicans are contending for the right to oppose
Dooley, who won 57 percent in 1994. The GOP front-runner is
Assemblyman Trice Harvey, who reportedly did not want to run
against Dooley, but opted to do so because the state's term
limits law is forcing him out of the California Assembly.

      At the southern end of the state, Republicans also think
they may have a shot against San Diego-based Rep. Robert Filner.
While three Republicans have filed for the nomination, local
observers feel Filner is in greater jeopardy in the Democratic
primary.

      San Diego Councilman Juan Vargas, a Democrat who lost to
Filner in a crowded primary in 1992, is running again. Vargas'
assets include a Harvard degree and a Hispanic background in a
district that is 40 percent Hispanic.

      For the Democrats, the targets include three GOP freshmen:
Reps. Frank Riggs, Andrea Seastrand, and Brian Bilbray.

      Riggs, who represents a district that stretches from north
of San Francisco to the Oregon border, first won the seat in
1990, lost it in 1992, and regained it in 1994. Former Democratic
Rep. Dan Hamburg, who lost to Riggs last time out, opted not to
run again this year.

      There are a half-dozen contenders in the Democratic primary
for Riggs' seat, with the three leading contenders including two
recent immigrants from San Francisco. They are Carol Ruth Silver,
a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who
moved into the district last year, and Michela Alioto, a daughter
of former San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto and, until recently,
an aide to Vice President Gore.

      The third major contender is attorney Monica Marvin. She is
backed by state Sen. Mike Thompson, who was the Democrats' first
choice to take on Riggs.

      In the Santa Barbara area, Seastrand will face a rematch
against Democrat Walter Holden Capps, whom she defeated by just
1,500 votes in 1994. And in San Diego, three Democrats are vying
to take on Bilbray. But Democratic prospects there received a
setback just days before the filing deadline when former Rep.
Lynn Schenk, who lost to Bilbray in 1994, announced she would not
run again.

      The leading contender in the three-way Democratic primary
is University of California at Irvine professor Peter Navarro,
who hosts a local talk show. But Navarro carries political
baggage from unsuccessful runs for supervisor and mayor. Also
running is small business owner Nancy Casady, who has ties to
some leading state Democrats.

      The Democrats also are eyeing the open seat of retiring GOP
Rep. Carlos Moorhead in the Los Angeles area and the Long Beach-
based district of GOP Rep. Stephen Horn.

      Two Democrats have filed to take on Horn: 1994 primary
candidate and professor Peter Matthews, and attorney Rick Zbur.
Horn won in 1994 with 58 percent, but won with only 49 percent in
1992.

      Assemblyman James Rogan is the leading GOP contender for
Moorhead's seat, while the Democrats will have tough primary
battle between Douglas Kahn, a wealthy businessman who was
Moorhead's 1992 and 1994 opponent, and Barry Gordon, an actor and
former president of the Screen Actors Guild.

      In the second tier of Democratic targets are GOP Reps.
Richard Pombo and Sonny Bono. Pombo likely will face Democrat
Jason Silva, a public relations consultant, in the Stockton area
seat. Former radio personality and retired businesswoman Anita
Rufus has filed for the Democratic nod against Bono in the Palm
Springs-based district. Meawhile, 10 Democrats have entered the
special election to succeed Democratic Rep. Walter Tucker, who
resigned last month following his conviction on federal bribery
and tax evasion charges.

      The special primary will coincide with the March 26
primary. If no candidate for the open seat receives more than 50
percent, a runoff will be held. The Los Angeles area district is
three-quarters black and Hispanic and is overwhelmingly
Democratic.

      The leading Democrats in the race include Assembly members
Willard Murray and Juanita McDonald, Lynwood Mayor Paul Richards,
Compton Mayor Omar Bradley and Compton City Clerk Charles Davis,
as well as Tucker's wife, Robin, who has operated a youth
training center.

81 Republicans Oppose Deal That Trims $245B Tax Cut

      A group of 81 Republican senators and House members, as
well as one House Democrat, has sent a letter to President
Clinton, House Speaker Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Dole
vowing to oppose any final budget deal that has less than the
$245 billion in tax cuts contained in the budget reconciliation
bill vetoed by Clinton. "We urge you to support a plan that
provides real tax relief for families and economic growth for
small businesses and that balances the budget in seven years; we
also urge you to reject any plan that does not," said the letter,
which was initiated by Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., and Sen. Rod
Grams, R-Minn., and released Tuesday. "You can count on our
steadfast opposition to any budget plan that turns its back on
our promises to American families," the members said. The letter,
signed by 52 Republican House members, one House Democrat, Rep.
Ralph Hall of Texas, and 29 GOP senators also said "the
congressionally approved tax relief package must not be
sacrificed at the altar of more spending and a bigger
government." It further contends "tax relief for families is
critical."

      Among those signing the letter were Senate Majority Whip
Lott, Senate Banking Chairman D'Amato and Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas, who was the only GOP senator seeking the presidency to
sign the letter.

No Senate Votes Slated This Week

      No roll call votes are planned in the Senate this week or
next week unless there is significant movement in budget
negotiations which would require floor action, Senate Majority
Leader Dole announced Tuesday.

      In a Senate floor statement, Dole added that senators will
have ample warning to return to Washington if votes are called
for any reason.

      Today at noon, both the House and Senate are slated to
officially begin the second session of the 104th Congress.

      Votes are expected in the House today, Thursday and Friday,
according to the House GOP cloakroom recorded message for
members.

      The House this week may take up an override of President
Clinton's vetoes of the FY96 Defense authorization legislation
and FY96 Commerce-Justice-State, Interior and VA-HUD
appropriations bills.

      An override attempt also is possible in the House this week
on welfare reform legislation if it is vetoed by Clinton, as the
president promised before Christmas.

      In addition, a bill to permit states to operate national
parks at their own expense during the federal government shutdown
also may be brought to the House floor.

Pressler Urges Quick Passage Of Th Telco Bill

      In an effort to keep up the momentum for passage of
telecommunications reform legislation, Senate Commerce Chairman
Pressler Tuesday issued a statement urging his colleagues to act
quickly to approve a conference agreement. "Congress should put
telecommunications reform first on its list of New Year's
legislative resolutions," Pressler said. House Speaker Gingrich
during a Capitol Hill press conference last Thursday said he "was
going to ask [Senate Majority Leader] Dole probably to have a
meeting on Wednesday with the leading members on the House and
Senate Republican side to go over the [telecommunications] bill."
Gingrich added, "Both of us had expressed some interest, some
concern, about some pieces of the bill." In addition, sources
earlier Tuesday said Dole and Gingrich were expected to try to
iron out a final compromise on four or five outstanding issues in
the telecommunications bill at a joint House-Senate leadership
meeting this morning. However, Dole's office and House Commerce
Committee aides late Tuesday said no such meeting on the
telecommunications legislation had been scheduled for today.

Senators Object To Proposed Regulations On Tobacco

      A group of 32 senators, led by Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
and Wendell Ford, D-Ky., Tuesday signed a comment to the FDA
strongly objecting to the agency's proposal to regulate the sale
and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. "Congress
has not given FDA either `clear direction' or any authority to
regulation tobacco," the senators said. Tuesday was the deadline
for public comment on the FDA proposal, which is designed to
prevent teenagers from taking up cigarette smoking and tobacco
chewing. The tobacco industry submitted several thousand pages of
documents opposing FDA regulation and denying that nicotine is
addictive. The senators in their comment declared, "While we
stand steadfastly against tobacco use by minors, we strenuously
object to FDA's effort to expand its jurisdiction and the federal
bureaucracy in dealing with a problem that Congress has already
designated to the states." The senators said Congress in 1992
decided that states should address tobacco use by minors when it
required each state to implement a program to keep minors from
obtaining tobacco products. Congress has denied FDA the authority
to regulate tobacco, the senators added.

NRSC Files Complaint Against Wyden Senate Campaign

      The National Republican Senatorial Committee has filed a
complaint with the FEC alleging irregularities in the Senate
campaign of Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. The complaint, dated last
Thursday, said the AFL-CIO and the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League "are about to violate federal
election law in the Oregon Special Election by making a series of
massive illegal independent expenditures they have improperly
coordinated with the Wyden for Senate campaign and its agents."
The complaint requested the FEC make an "immediate determination"
that the AFL-CIO is illegally subsidizing the Wyden campaign with
"an unusually large number of political operatives" and that the
AFL-CIO and NARAL are prohibited from making independent
expenditures on behalf of Wyden because the groups are "not
legally independent" from the campaign. The Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee termed the complaint is "superficial" and "an
attempt to shift focus from [GOP candidate Gordon Smith's] dismal
business and political record." Wyden and Smith are seeking the
seat of former GOP Sen. Bob Packwood in a Jan. 30 special
election.

Majority In State Believes Thurmon Should Not Seek Re-election

      In a new South Carolina poll, almost 60 percent of likely
GOP primary voters believe 93-year-old Senate Armed Services
Chairman Thurmond should not seek another term. The survey,
conducted for The State newspaper by Mason-Dixon Opinion
Research, found 59 percent believe Thurmond should not seek
another term, while 33 percent feel he should. And while 44
percent said they would vote for Thurmond in a primary, 56
percent said they would consider someone else. In a matchup
against former Gov. Carroll Campbell and Secretary of State Jim
Miles, Thurmond led Campbell by just 40-37 percent, within the
survey's 4.7 point error margin. Miles was at 8 percent. In a
head-to-head with Thurmond, Miles trailed 53-26. Campbell told
The State he will not run against Thurmond, while Miles
sidestepped questions about challenging Thurmond. The poll of 472
likely primary voters was conducted Dec. 26-27.

Durbin Camp Seeks To get Primary Foe Off The Ballot

      Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who is seeking his party's
Senate nomination in the March primary, is hoping to get a
little-known, but well-heeled, foe off the primary ballot. Durbin
last week lodged objections to more than 90 percent of the
petition signatures filed by Chicago attorney Clinton Krislov,
and asked state officials to bar Krislov from the ballot, the
Chicago Tribune reported. An attorney for the Durbin campaign
said volunteers had cross-checked signatures on Krislov's
petitions with voter lists, and had found thousands that did not
match. Krislov, who made a fortune by representing plaintiffs in
class action suits, termed the allegations "outrageous," while
adding, "I'm almost flattered that [Durbin] recognizes the impact
I'm going to have on this race." Krislov has said he will dip
into personal funds to bankroll his campaign. There are four
other Democratic contenders, including former state Treasurer
Patrick Quinn.

CORPORATE LEADERS ASKED TO SHARE IN NATIONAL SACRIFICE

     In  further  response  on Dec. 27 to the advertisement by  a  number  of
corporate executives, forty six congressional Democrats led by Reps. Gephardt
(D=Mo.),  Obey  (D=Wis.) and Miller (D=Calif.) called on the  executives   to
detail the specific areas of personal and company sacrifice they are prepared
to make to assist in efforts to balance the budget.  Rep. Obey said "we think
it  is  important that bIg business understand that most Americans  have  not
benefited from the recent performance of the US economy.  We wanted to  point
out  that  there  were  a  number  of  areas  where  they  could  make  major
contributions.  Given the timing of their ad we thought they should  remember
that  there  are a lot of Bob Cratchits out there and that  big  corporations
might  want  to see if they could pick up a little of the burden  instead  of
laying everything off on the Cratchit family."

     Meanwhile,  on  Dec. 27, Sen. Gramm (R=Tex.) said "it is  critical  that
Senate  Republicans stand their ground as budget negotiations resume  in  the
coming  days.  While the Clinton Administration public relations machine  had
reduced  some Senate republicans to a defensive crouch in earlier  stages  of
the  confrontation,  the House Republicans have called  President   Clinton's
bluff.   Whenever   the President finally begins negotiating  with  America's
future   in  mind  instead  of his own, our  House  colleagues  are  due  the
credit...  House Republicans have taken the moral high ground in this  fight;
the  public is on our side, and President Clinton will have no choice but  to
join us if we keep the courage of our convictions," Sen. Gramm said.

CBO PROJECTS BUDGET PLAN WOULD PRODUCE INCREASING SURPLUS IN OUT YEARS

     The Congressional Budget Office on Dec. 21 said the proposed Seven  Year
Balanced Budget would produce increasing surpluses in 2003 of $10 billion, in
2004 of $30 billion and in 2005 of $50 billion.  The figures were given in  a
memorandum to the Senate Democratic Budget Committee staff that was requested
by Sen. Exon (D=Nebr.).

     House  Budget  Committee Chairman Kasich (R=Ohio) in a  comment  on  the
report said the surpluses "will likely be even larger if we maintain the  cap
on discretionary spending.  Our balanced budget," he said, "is an honest  and
fair  plan  that uses real numbers, conservative  economic  assumptions,  and
makes fundamental structural changes in the Federal government. Balancing the
Federal  budget  now  is  the best Christmas present we  could  give  to  our
children and grandchildren," Rep. Kaisch concluded.

INFORMATION ON LOBBYING REGISTRATION UNDER NEW LAW PLACED IN RECORD

     The  Secretary  of the Senate and the Clerk of the House  filed  in  the
Congressional  Record  information on the new Lobbying Disclosure  Act  (P.L.
104=65)  that  takes  effect  on Jan. 1,  1996.   In  general,  the  Lobbying
Disclosure  Act establishes broad requirements that individuals and  entities
who  seek to influence the Federal government register with the Secretary  of
the  Senate and Clerk of the House and disclose their clients, issues,  fees,
and interests of foreign entities.  All registrations filed under the Act are
public records.

     Information,  forms and instructions will be available in early  January
from  the  House  Legislative Resource Center  1036  Longworth  House  Office
Building  and  Senate  Office  of Public  Records,  232  Hart  Senate  Office
Building.  The first reports under the new act will be due by Aug. 14,  1996.
Lobbying  firms  must file separate reports for each  client.  (Congressional
Record Dec. 22 p. S=19290=21).

     After the law was signed, Sen. Cohen (R=Me.) said he was hopeful that it
would persuade the people "that Congress's business can be done in the  open.
Lobbyists  now  have  to make full disclosure of who they  are,  who  they're
lobbying on behalf of and how much they're spending to do what.  I think many
people  are under the impression that lobbyists are dictating and  dominating
the  legislative process in this country.  They're cynical about it and  they
feel that people who have the money are the ones reaping the benefits."

     Sen. Levin (D=Mich.) also praised the bill.  He said one of the  reasons
he  fought for the bill "is because if we want the public to have  confidence
in  our  actions, the nation's business has got to be conducted more  in  the
sunshine.  When public cynicism runs deep about a democratic government, that
government must act to restore that public confidence."

     Common  Cause  President  Ann McBride said the  bill  and  Congressional
earlier  action ending the lobbyist gift system provide hope to the  American
people  by showing that political reform is possible and their voices can  be
heard on Capitol Hill.

SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE REPORTS LABOR SUPPORT OF ANWR OIL SALE

     The  Senate Energy Committee on Dec. 22 reported that  Robert  Georgine,
President  of the AFL=CIO Building and Construction Trades Department sent  a
letter to President asking him to include the provision to lease a small part
of  the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge coastal plain  for  oil   exploration
and development  in  any  compromise on the budget  reconciliation   package.
The  Committee   said  that on Oct. 25, the presidents of  five   other   key
AFL=CIO unions issued similar endorsements.

     "On  behalf  of  the  over 3 million  American  working  men  and  women
represented  by the 15 member unions of the Building and Construction  Trades
Department, AFL=CIO, I again ask that you support the provision to allow  the
responsible  leasing  of  a small part of the ANWR  coastal  plain.  American
working families across the US depend on your support," Mr. Georgine wrote.

     Senate  Energy  Committee  Chairman Murkowski  (R=Alaska)  said  he  was
pleased  with  the decision to push for ANWR leasing.  "This is  a  big  step
forward  because it is further proof that the opening of a tiny part  of  the
coastal plain to oil exploration will pay huge benefits to the nation and the
working  people  of America.  It will produce hundreds of thousands  of  high
paying  jobs.  For the first time, we have moved ANWR through both the  House
and the Senate with significant support.  The only thing standing in the  way
of ANWR becoming a reality is the Clinton Administration and Secretary of the
Interior Bruce Babbitt," he said.

FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE: CURRENT ISSUES AND OPTIONS FOR REFORM

By Ralph M. Chite, Environment and Natural Resources Policy Division.
18 pages.  Farmer participation in the federally subsidized crop
insurance program has fallen short of goals anticipated in 1980 when
the program was greatly expanded.  Low participation rates have
contributed to the enactment of ad hoc disaster assistance bills,
which have authorized more than $6 billion in additional direct
payments since 1988. Many policymakers are concerned that the federal
budget cannot continue to support both crop insurance and disaster
payments, and that Congress might be required to reconsider the
proper role of the government in farm risk management.  This paper
pro-vides background on the mechanics of the crop insurance program
and explores policy options and dilemmas in reforming the program.
Order No. 92-318 ENR.

THE FEDERAL DEBT:  WHO BEARS ITS BURDEN?  ISSUE BRIEF

By William A. Cox, Office of Senior Specialists.  As the federal
government's debt has mushroomed since 1992 at a rate unparalleled in
peacetime, questions about its effects have taken on greater
importance.  Despite steps to reduce the deficit, public debt will
continue to rise rapidly in the next several years.  Who is being
hurt by this development, and who, if anyone, benefits?  Should we be
concerned about heavy reliance on foreign capital?  What are the
implications of rising federal interest payments?  Are we "mortgaging
the nation's future," imposing a swelling burden on posterity?  These
questions are the subject of this brief.  Order No. IB92049.

SHAREHOLDER VOTING CONCERNING EXECUTIVE PAY

By Michael V. Seitzinger, American Law Division.  4 pages.  The issue
of how much executives of a corporation should be paid is especially
controversial at this time.  A recent change by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in an interpretation of the proxy regulations
will require certain shareholder proposals concerning executive
compensation to be included in proxy materials.  Nevertheless, there
is still congressional interest in enacting legislation more
stringent than this interpretation.  Order No. 92-254 A.

CONSTITUTIONALITY OF COMPELLING DISCLOSURES CONCERNING MOTION PICTURE
ALTERATIONS

By Henry Cohen, American Law Division.  5 pages.  Although movie
marquees and posters, and video cassette casings and boxes, serve to
identify a film and the individuals associated with it, they also
implicitly propose a commercial transaction.  If the bill required
that a film itself disclose information, a better case could be made
that the bill regulated noncommercial speech.  As it is, however, it
appears more likely that the bill would be viewed as regulating
solely commercial speech.  Order No. 92-256 A.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FUNDING ISSUES:  FY 1993; ISSUE BRIEF

By Angela Evans, Education and Public Welfare Division.  Each year
Congress decides funding levels for all programs within the
Department of Education (ED).  Most ED programs are discretionary.
This means that the annual appropriation determines the amount of
funding that will be available to support program activities for a
given fiscal year.  During the process Congress deliberates what
might be appropriate levels of funding for ED programs, how these
levels differ from previous year funding levels, how programs might
be changed to effect savings, and how funding for ED programs
complies with the budget enforcement provisions to restrain spending
on domestic discretionary programs.  Order No. IB92048.

GIANT OIL FIELDS AND DOMESTIC OIL PRODUCTION

By Joseph P. Riva, Jr., Science Policy Research Division.  7 pages.
Giant oil fields are among the most valuable concentrations of
natural wealth on earth.  When developed anywhere, they contribute
significantly to economic and individual well-being.  With its high
standard of living based on high per capita energy consumption, this
has been particularly true for the United States.  New giant fields
are needed to shore up declining domestic oil production, thus
helping to keep energy affordable.  However, almost all undiscovered
domestic giant fields are likely to be site-specific to a relatively
few areas in Alaska and on the outer continental shelves.  Great
controversy reflecting differing societal values surrounds the
development of oil in these areas, but there is a price for not
exploring.  it could be very high.  Order No. 92-265 SPR.

OIL RECYCLING BILLS:  A COMPARISON OF H.R. 872, H.R. 1411, H.R. 3956,
AND INDUSTRY'S PROPOSAL

By Mark Reisch, Environment and Natural Resources Policy Division.
22 pages.  Used oil is a valuable resource that can be re-refined
back into lubricating oil, or used as a fuel.  But when disposed
improperly, it presents a threat to the environment and public
health.  How to properly regulate used oil to protect the
environment, while at the same time encouraging recycling and not
discouraging collection, has been a difficult problem for the
Environmental Protection Agency.  This report compares, section by
section, three bills of the 102nd Congress and a proposal of the
American Petroleum Institute that attempt to encourage recycling of
used oil.  Order No. 92-247 ENR.

BANK MERGERS AND INTERSTATE BANKING:  POLICY ISSUES

By William Jackson, Economics Division.  25 pages.  To some
observers, the very survival of the banking industry as we know it
appears threatened.  Its falling market shares and profitability may
suggest that industry consolidation is necessary to eliminate excess
capacity; some believe through nationwide banking involving
acquisitions across state lines.  But would the result be consistent
with financial competition?  This report analyzes the economic
relationships involved, and presents policy options for Congress to
deal with them.  Order No. 92-305 E.

CONGRESS AND THE CRISIS IN U.S.-CHINA POLICY, 1991

By Robert G. Sutter, Office of Senior Specialists.  24 pages.  The
debate between the Bush Administration and its congressional backers,
and a large bipartisan group of critics in Congress over U.S. policy
toward China went through three general states in 1991.  The first
stage saw congressional criticism of China, and Bush Administration
policy toward China, moderate in late 1990 and early 1991.  There was
an outpouring of congressional criticism of China on human rights,
trade, and arms proliferation issues, and criticism of the Bush
Administration's "failed" China policy.  The third state came after
critical votes on conditional most favored nation legislation in
July.  At year's end, all sides in the debate anticipated continued
strong congressional criticism of Chinese practices and Bush
Administration policy.  Order No. 92-324 S.

THE ISRAELI ECONOMY AND ITS EXTERNAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS:  AN OVERVIEW

By Patricia Wertman, Economics Division.  34 pages.  This report
examines the performance of the Israeli economy between 1985 and
1990.  The results of Israel's 1985 stabilization program are
discussed.  Particular emphasis is placed upon Israel's external
sector, that is, its export performance and its level of external
indebtedness.  The report concludes that Israel's stabilization
policy has been largely successful, but that the economy requires
significant resource transfers from abroad.  The recent surge of
immigration into Israel is likely to place fundamental economic
patterns under stress, particularly the near-monopoly structure of
Israel's labor market.  The future outlook of the Israeli economy
and, particularly, its future debt-servicing capacity are tied to
these issues.  Order No. 92-276 E.

YUGOSLAVIA:  NATIONALISM AND ETHNIC RELATIONS:  SELECTED REFERENCES,
1989-1992

By Valentin Leskovsek, Library Services Division.  22 pages.  Events
in Yugoslavia in the last few years have exposed the fragile unity of
a loosely knit, multinational federation.  After the Second World
War, Tito's communism kept an iron hand on the ethnic tensions.  With
his death, the political polarization along ethnic, religious, and
economic lines resurfaced, and national antagonisms rendered a
peaceful solution impossible.  Seeing no way out of a constitutional
stalemate, Slovenia and Croatia each voted for a peaceful separation
and independence.  This brought the armed intervention of the
Yugoslav army wishing to prevent federal disintegration, a step that
pushed the country into a civil war.  This short bibliography of
selected books and articles deals with the present Yugoslav crisis.

ANTITRUST LAW AND JOINT ACTIVITY BY HOSPITALS

By Janice E. Rubin, American Law Division.  9 pages.  Some concern
has been expressed that the federal antitrust laws may be unduly
hindering some hospitals from undertaking joint activities--including
the sharing of technology or expensive medical equipment--which they
believe are necessary in order to maximize the efficiency of their
operations.  Indeed, many hospital administrators are afraid that if
they even talk to each other, much less undertake joint programs,
they will automatically violate the antitrust laws, which prohibit
the anticompetitive consequences of certain actions.  This report,
therefore, will first get out some of the more important concepts in
antitrust law which are pertinent to the issue of joint activity by
hospitals.  It will conclude, after establishing a context, with some
possible congressional or hospital actions to reduce the likelihood
of antitrust challenges.  Order No. 92-269 A.

BREAST CANCER

By Judith A. Johnson, Science Policy Research Division.  2 pages.
For women, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer.  The
National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates that in 1992 46,000 women
will die of breast cancer and 180,000 new cases will be diagnosed.
Controversy continues over the use of mammography in screening
asymptomatic women for the early detection of breast cancer.  A 1990
National Institutes of Health consensus development conference
concluded that lumpectomy is as effective as mastectomy in treating
early breast cancer.  Despite this, only 20 percent of women eligible
for lumpectomy have this new procedure.  Debate persists over whether
breast cancer patients with negative lymph nodes should receive
adjuvant therapy with its attendant risks when only a small
percentage of those treated will actually benefit.  Order No. 92-279

OVARIAN CANCER

By Judith A. Johnson, Science Policy Research Division.  2 pages.
Ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality,
behind lung, breast, and colo-rectal.  The National Cancer Institute
(NCI) estimates that in 1992 13,000 women will die of ovarian cancer
and 21,000 new cases will be diagnosed.  Ovarian cancer is difficult
to diagnose because it often imitates other diseases.  Recent
research indicates that if it is detected early, a cure is possible.
NCI is supporting research in a number of institutions to evaluate
the usefulness of early screening methods in the detection of ovarian
cancer.  Order No. 92-280 SPR.

WOMEN WITH HIV INFECTION

By Judith A. Johnson, Science Policy Research Division.  6 pages.
Although, at present, women account for only 10 percent of AIDS cases
reported to CDC, women are the fastest growing group in the HIV
epidemic.  The route of HIV exposure in women is shifting from IV
drug use to heterosexual contact.  Because the medical conditions
experienced by many HIV-infected women are not included in the CDC
AIDS definition, women often are diagnosed and treated later than
men.  Also, women may not qualify for benefit payments because their
symptoms differ from men's.  Order No. 92-281 SPR.

indicate that, on net, perhaps 1.2 million households will form
annually in the first half of the decade, slowing slightly to about

ATTORNEY'S FEES:  THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL TO ADOPT THE
ENGLISH RULE

By Harry Cohen, American Law Division.  In the United States, each
party to a lawsuit ordinarily must pay its own attorneys' fees.
Courts generally may order the losing party to pay the winning
party's fees only when authorized by statute.  This is known as the
"American rule," in contrast with the English rule, under which the
losing party routinely pays the attorneys' fees of the prevailing
party.  The President's Council on Competitiveness has proposed that
Congress adopted the English rule in cases brought in federal court
on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.  The proposal has been
introduced by Representative Fish and by Senator Grassley as section
3 of the Access to Justice Act of 1992, H.R. 4155 and S. 2180, 102nd

PROVISIONS OF STATE LAW ABROGATING RESTRICTIONS ON POSSESSION OF
FIREARMS BY CONVICTED FELONS

By P.L. Morgan, American Law Division.  Federal law prohibits a
felon, convicted by state or federal authorities, from possessing
firearms.  Most states have similar laws.  Relief from this
disability arising from a federal conviction for crimes against the
United States can come from a Presidential pardon.  The diverse
states have several methods of authorizing felons to possess
firearms, though not all do.  Eliminating the state prohibition also
has the effect of authorizing the felon to legally possess firearms
under federal law.  This report briefly describes the state laws
prohibiting possession of firearms by felons and the provisions, if
any, for voiding those restrictions.  Order No. 92-262 A.

INTELLIGENCE REORGANIZATION PROPOSALS:  ISSUE BRIEF

By Richard A. Best, Foreign Affairs and National Defense Division.
With the end of the Cold War, many observers are urging that the U.S.
intelligence community be reshaped to serve altered national security
policies and to accommodate likely budgetary reductions.  Some
members of Congress believe that reorganization of the intelligence
community should be accomplished, at lease in part, by legislation.
Bills have been introduced and it is likely that there will be
considerable discussion of intelligence reorganization throughout the
remainder of the 102nd Congress.  Order No. IB92053.

By Louis Alan Talley and Brian W. Cashell, Economics Division.  5
pages.  This report provides inflation-adjusted excise tax rates for
alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline products, a brief history of the tax
rates since November 1951, and current revenues.  Each commodity had
rate increases as part of the Revenue Act of 1951.  This tax act was

THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX FOR INDIVIDUALS

By Gregg A. Esenwein, Economics Division.  5 pages.  Many individuals
are able to take advantage of the preferences and incentives in the
individual tax code to reduce their income taxes and avoid paying
their share of the tax burden.  To address this problem of fairness
while still preserving the social and economic incentives in the tax
code, Congress enacted the individual minimum tax.  Since its
inception, the value and effectiveness of the minimum tax has
routinely been the focus of congressional debate.  Order No. 92-304

INCOME TAX PAYMENTS BY FOREIGN-CONTROLLED CORPORATIONS

By Harry G. Gourevitch, Office of Senior Specialists.  9 pages.  In
recent years allegations have been made that domestic corporations
controlled by foreign investors are less profitable and pay less
income tax than domestic corporations controlled by U.S. investors,
and that as a result the United States may be losing billions of
dollars in tax revenue annually.  This report examines the evidence
as to the low profitability of foreign-controlled corporations
compared to U.S.-controlled ones.  Order No. 92-261 S.

THE QUESTION OF INDEXING CAPITAL GAINS BY REGULATION

By Harry G. Gourevitch, Office of Senior Specialists.  7 pages.
Proposals have recently been made to index capital gains for
inflation by amending current Treasury regulations rather than the
Internal Revenue Code.  Advocates of this approach point out that it
is not unusual for the Treasury Department to revoke regulations
outstanding and to issue new ones in their place.  This report

TAX PROPOSALS: A BRIEF COMPARISON OF THE HOUSE, SENATE, AND
ADMINISTRATION ALTERNATIVES

By Jack Taylor and David L. Brumbaugh, Economics Division.  9 pages.
As March 1991, enters its closing weeks, Congress is moving toward
final consideration of three alternative tax plans:  one sponsored by
the President; one passed by the House; and one approved by the
Senate.  The plans are similar in certain broad respects; all contain
saving and investment incentives designed to improve economic
performance, and all contain a number of provisions whose stated goal
in to assist families or to promote health, education, and home
ownership.  The details of the plans, however, differed widely.

TAX PROVISIONS EXPIRING IN 1992

By David L. Brumbauch, Economics division.  6 pages.  As Congress
debates alternative tax plans in 1992, one question it is considering
is the fate of 12 temporary tax provisions that are scheduled to
expire at the end of June 1992.  In each case, the immediate issue is
whether to let the particular provision expire, or to extend it or
make it permanent.  And while each of the so-called "extenders" is
unique, at a very general level they all pose a similar questions:
each extender is a tax benefit for a particular activity, and each
results in a loss of tax revenue.  In each case, is the activity the
provision promotes beneficial enough to warrant government support
and the resulting revenue loss and diversion of resources from other
uses?  Order No. 92-273 E.

TAX RATES AND THE MARRIAGE PENALTY

By Robert B. Burdette, American Law Division.  2 pages.  This report
examines the rate schedules and tables applied for purposes of
calculating liability under the federal income tax.  One frequently
asked question concerning the rate schedules is why taxable income
reported by an unmarried individual is taxed at a higher rate than a
like amount of taxable income reported by a married couple filing
jointly.  This is an anomaly of having graduated rates applicable to
different types of taxpayers.  Order No. 92-319 A.

BRIEF

By William H. Cooper, Economics Division.  With Japan the United

its most difficult, trading relationships.  Japan is an important
market for U.S. exports and source of U.S. imports.  But large U.S.

penetration in some key sectors and over foreign unfair trade
practices, are considering legislation to alter U.S. trade policy.

LEGALIZATION MOVEMENT GETS BOOST

"It is our judgement that the war on drugs has failed," writes National
Review Editor William Buckley in the latest edition of the conservative
magazine. The issue includes articles favoring drug legalization by many
long-time legalization advocates, including: Ethan Nadelmann, director of
the Lindesmith Center; Steven B. Duke, a Yale University Law Professor;
Joseph D. McNamara, a former police chief; Kurt Schmoke, Mayor of
Baltimore; Thomas Szasz a Psychiatrist at Syracuse University, and Robert
W. Sweet, a federal judge in New York.

Buckley writes in the lead article that the war on drugs "is diverting
intelligent energy away from how to deal with the problem of addiction, that
it is wasting our resources, and that it is encouraging civil, judicial, and
penal procedures associated with police states." He said that the series of
articles in National Review was designed to mobilize "fresh thought on the
drug problem." However, prominent law enforcement and political leaders
from both major political parties sharply condemned the magazine.

DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine said that legalization would be a
disaster and that "As a citizen, I'm appalled at adding one more social 
ill to a country that already has AIDS and murders."

Former Drug Czar and Education Secretary William Bennett said that
"National Review's position on drug legalization is bankrupt morally,
intellectually and, thank god, politically."
In his National Review article Ethan Nadelmann said the "drug
enforcement/treatment complex" is so "hooked on government dollars that
the anti-drug crusade has become a vested interest." Nadelmann also had
harsh words for DEA's "ideologically driven bureaucrats who intimidate
and persecute doctors for prescribing pain medication in medically
appropriate doses, who hobble methadone programs with their
overregulation, who acknowledge that law enforcement cannot alone solve
the drug problem but then proceed to undermine innovative public health
initiatives."

Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke recommended that the war on drugs be
fought as a "public-health war." Under this system, he explains, the
government would set up a regulatory regime to "pull addicts into the
public-health system. The Government, not criminal traffickers, would
control the price, distribution, and purity of addictive substances-which it
already does with prescription drugs. This would take most of the profit out
of drug trafficking, and it is the profits which drive the crime," says
Schmoke.
He also recommended an expansion of needle exchange programs and
called the war on drugs "our domestic Vietnam."

Joseph McNamara, Former police chief (in Kansas City, Mo., and San Jose
Ca.) said the "military industrial complex pales in comparison to the host of
industries catering to our national puritanical hypocrisy-researchers willing
to tell the government what it wants to hear, prison builders, correction and
parole officers's associations, drug testing companies, dubious purveyors
of anti-drug education."

Robert Sweet, a District Judge in New York City argues that the rights of
the individual have been curtailed in the name of the War on Drugs. "We
have seen the elimination of an accused's right to pretrial release for most
charges under drug laws; heightened restrictions on post-conviction bail;
and invasions into the attorney-client relationship through criminal
forfeiture"

He also states that the "fundamental flaw, which will ultimately destroy this
prohibition as it did the last one, is that criminal sanctions cannot, and
should not attempt to, prohibit personal conduct, which does no harm to
others." He does not address the tragedy of drug addicted babies.

Thomas Szasz, of the Department of Psychiatry at Syracuse University,
charges that the war on drugs is a mass movement characterized by the
demonizing of drugs, addicts, and traffickers as the incarnations of evil. "It
is foolish to dwell on the drug prohibitionist's failure to attain his avowed
aims. Since he wages war on evil, his very effort is synonymous with
success. It is a fatal weakness of prudential critiques of drug policy 
that they ignore the Treligious' character of the war on drugs," says Szasz.

He asks that the right analogy for America's war on drugs is not the
Vietnam war, but communism. Szasz further suggests that "self-
medication" is a basic human right and drug criminalization is sinful.

Steven Duke, Law of Science and Technology Professor at Yale Law
School argues that under legalization, with drugs regulated by the
government, the "proportion of users who would consume drugs without
substantial health or other problems would be greatly increased. He writes
that the only benefit to America in maintaining prohibition is the "psychic
comfort we derive from having a permanent scapegoat. We would be better
off blaming our ills on celestial invaders flying about in flying saucers."

COPS PROGRAM FACES 25% CUT

The COPS police hiring program faces a 25% cut under a six week
continuing resolution enacted by Congress and signed by the President.
Bipartisan negotiations between the White House and Congress produced
another stopgap spending bill to keep the entire federal government running
through March 15. Also facing a 25% cut were the Ounce of Prevention
Council and the drug courts program.

Republicans abandoned their strategy to use government shutdowns as
leverage to advance their balanced-budget goals. Congress and the
administration produced a bill (HR 2880) that combined short-term funding
for nine Cabinet departments whose annual budgets have yet to become law
with full fiscal 1996 funding for foreign aid.

The Congressional budget ax would continue to nick but not behead some
cherished Clinton initiatives, including not only the COPS program, but
also the AmeriCorps National Service program, and subsidies for
community development financial institutions. Funding for these would
continue at a pro-rated level of 75 percent of last year's funding, at least
through March 15. The bill also would end 10 programs, mostly education
grants.

The measure also served as a vehicle for carrying a host of lower-profile
initiatives into law, including a ban on federal funding of fetal embryo
research, restrictions on excessive travel by Cabinet members and the sale
of $100 million worth of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Preserve.

The House passed the much-revised bill Jan. 25 on a 371-42 vote after a
full day of negotiations in the office of Appropriations Committee Chairman
Robert L. Livingston, R-La., finally produced a compromise that all sides
could live with.  The Senate cleared the bill the next day, 82-8, after
defeating Democratic amendments to raise the statutory debt limit and
restore spending on education to fiscal 1995 levels.

President Clinton signed it into law by the midnight Jan. 26 deadline. The
measure provided funding through March 15 at fiscal 1996 conference
levels for the departments of Commerce, Justice, State, Veterans Affairs,
and HUD and other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection
Agency. Clinton earlier had vetoed both the Commerce, Justice and State
bill and the VA-HUD measure.

Programs funded under the Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education bill (HR 2880) and the vetoed Interior spending measure (HR
2880) would be financed at fiscal 1995 levels or the House- or Senate-
passed levels, whichever is lowest. Meanwhile, House-Senate negotiators
on the District of Columbia spending bill (HR 2880) said that final action is
imminent on the measure after they reached agreement on a controversial
school voucher plan.

The final product reflected an unusual degree of bipartisanship, given the
rancor displayed during the two prior partial federal shutdowns. With the
House, Senate and the administration all seeking to avoid another
shutdown, the frequently intense negotiations required give on all sides.

Conspicuously absent was any effort to put more pressure on Clinton.  "We
want to get a signable bill," said Dan Meyer, the top aide to House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., as the talks were in the late stages.

TOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKS

"Drug law enforcement has proven to be an effective and integral part of the
battle against illicit drugs and crime in United States," writes former
Michigan State Drug Czar Robert E. Peterson in a fact-filled new report
entitled, The Success of Tough Drug Enforcement.
Peterson uses scores of Justice Department studies to explain and describe
the positive impact of drug enforcement.

The report notes that from 1986-1992, a 13% rise in drug enforcement
manpower brought about a 39% increase in violent crime arrests and a
110% increase in heroin/cocaine trafficking arrests. Since 1980 drug
incarceration rates have increased over 400%. Peterson says that this
increased incarceration had let to the plummeting of murder rates and
narcotics related homicides in most American cities.

"Contrary to popular belief, most drug convicts, and nearly all drug
inmates, are repeat or violent offenders." Thus, getting them off the streets
sharply reduces crime.

Although some advocates for decriminalization of drugs state that U.S.
prisons are bursting with first time or minor offenders, Peterson finds
"Over 93% of state inmates are repeat and/or violent offenders and first time
non-violent marijuana inmates constitute only 1/10 of 1% of the prison
population. He also notes that the average amount of drugs in a marijuana
trafficking case is 3.5 tons, and for cocaine it is 180 pounds. Over 80% of
crack cases involve trafficking of an average quantity of over 18,000 crack
doses.

The report states that although the odds of imprisonment for drugs have
increased over the last ten years, the nation is still far too lenient with
drug felons.  A person, Peterson says, is more likely to go to a federal
prison for violating federal tax, regulatory, immigration, or liquor laws than
for possessing heroin, crack or marijuana.

Nonetheless, those drug criminals that are placed behind bars, result in a
significant cost savings to the public. This is due to the fact that most drug
felons are repeat offenders, many involved with drugs. One study found
that heroin users committed more that 200 crimes per year to support their
drug habit.

The cost of incarcerating criminals averages $20,000 to $27,000 per year.
The estimated cost to society for crimes committed by the average released
criminal, range from $172,000 to $2.36 million per year. Under these
figures, based on several recent federal, state, and think tank studies, it
costs society at least seven times less money to keep someone in prison than
to let them go free.

Peterson strongly supports drug treatment, both for those who are in prison
and for those who are not.  However, he warns that without a regular regimen
of drug testing, treatment failure rates increase.  "Self-reports, counselor
reports, and infrequent or random drug testing significantly under-reports
individual drug use," says Peterson.  He cites a program in Lansing Michigan
which has kept 75% of participants drug-free over a five year period.  As part
of this program drug offenders are drug tested three times per week.  If
tested positive participants face a first sanction of three days in jail, a
second sanction of ten days in jail, a third sanction of 20 days jail and 30
days for each positive drug test thereafter.  Only a small proportion of
program participants ever served jail time.  Although counseling and support
groups (such as AA or NA) were provided, success rates did not vary among
those who participated in these activities.

Another area touched on in the report was the remarkable cost effectiveness
of the Drug Enforcement Administration-through bringing in asset
forfeiture funds. From 1990 to 1993 DEA's budget was $2.7 billion while
$2.2 billion in drug assets were forfeited to the United States. In 1990 an
average of over $250,000 was forfeited by drug dealers for each DEA
Special Agent.

An entire chapter of The Success of Tough Drug Enforcement is dedicated to
analysis of drug enforcement and race.  Peterson find that racial disparities
for drug offenses were lower than that for other crimes, such as murder,
robbery, and violent crime.  Generally, he explains, arrest and incarceration
rates are correlated with victimization rates, crime rates, and complaint
rates.  For example, the robbery rate among blacks is over three times that of
whites and the robbery convictions for blacks is two times that of whites in
state courts.  The rape conviction rate was nearly two times higher for whites
than blacks, and rape victims also were nearly twice as likely to be white.

Overall, blacks were victims of  violence at a rate of 40% higher than that of
whites and arrests of blacks were 39% higher than they were for whites.
Time served by drug offenders also does not vary significantly by race. For
drug trafficking offenses, blacks serve an average of 6% less time in prison
than whites.

Peterson makes a series of drug control policy recommendations in the
report. He suggests that drug enforcement efforts target youth with
sentences that include "strict zero tolerance drug testing" with  treatment
imposed by courts and probation departments. More serious repeat and
violent youth offenders "must be incapacitated and kept from victimizing
communities," he said.

The report also recommends a radical overhaul of probation and parole.
"The current failure rate of those on community release and lack of
consequences for violators indicate that this a weak link in the criminal
justice systems," Peterson says." The earlier that tough, but fair,
community release sanctions and conditions are applied, the greater the
likelihood of deterring crime and drug use, he argues.

Finally, Peterson recommends tougher marijuana enforcement, which has
become, he argues, "far too lax" while use of the drug by youth has rapidly
escalated. The proportion of violent juveniles on marijuana when arrested
has climbed and high school use of the drug has doubled in the last several
years. Peterson recommends that public benefits, student aid, and other
privileges be suspended, reduced, or conditioned on cessation of drug use
and criminal activity. Hefty finds and license revocations can be invoked
and public service conditions applied to repeat marijuana offenders.

The report's author, Robert Peterson served as Governor John Engler's
Drug Control Director from 1991-1995 where he Administered and
evaluated education, health, and law enforcement grant programs. Before
that he served as a prosecutor in Buffalo and a policy adviser to
Pennsylvania's Attorney General. He currently runs his own consulting
firm, PAE Services, Inc., which specializes in evaluating drug control
programs. Peterson can be reached at (607) 786-1845. Individual copies of
the report are available at $20 each from PAE.

NEW DRUG CZAR NAMED

U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey, named the new Director of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy during President Clinton's January 24
State of the Union Address, is expected to promote closer cooperation
between drug trafficking and producing countries to fight the narcotics trade
in his new job as President Clinton's drug czar.

Clinton said during his nationally televised speech, "General McCaffrey has
earned three purple hearts and two silver stars fighting for this country.
Tonight I ask that he lead our nation's battle against drugs at home and
abroad. To succeed, he needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded
before. He needs all of us - every one of us has a role to play on this team.
Thank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country one
more time."

 The general's stint as commander-in-chief of the United States Southern
Command in Panama included collaboration among Latin American
countries, especially Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, in the war on drugs.

"McCaffrey has praised the Andean range countries, where most of the
cultivation of cocaine takes place, of working together. He has always said
when countries work together, they benefit economically and socially," a
military spokesman said.

McCaffrey is a veteran of the Vietnam and Gulf Wars known for his tough
yet conciliatory style, McCaffrey, 53, was assigned in February 1994 as
commander-in-chief of Southcom, which is responsible for all U.S. military
activities in Latin America south of Mexico.

Some Army officials wondered though whether he did the right thing in
accepting the anti-drug post because as the highest decorated officer, he was
in line to become the next Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Some Panamanian officials hope he will make a case to keep some U.S.
troops in Panama after the canal treaties expire in the year 2000, especially
Howard Air Force Base which serves as the South American headquarters
of the  U.S. military's anti-drug trafficking efforts.

American AWACs reconnaissance aircraft fly regular missions from the
base to seek out drug planes flying up from South America towards Central
America and Mexico.

"They've given us information about flight plans of drug traffickers and
helped us detect shipments," said Panama's anti-drug chief Gabriel Castro.

Previously, General McCaffrey served as Director for Strategic Plans and
Policy, Joint Staff, from 1993 to 1994, and as Assistant to the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1992 to 1993.  From 1990 to 1992, General
McCaffrey commanded the 24th Infantry Division, which he deployed to
Saudi Arabia in 1990.  He led the Division on combat operations during
Operation Desert Storm, for which he was awarded the Distinguished
Service Medal.

From 1989 to 1990, General McCaffrey served as Director for Strategy,
Plans, Policy and Joint Affairs for the Department of the Army.  He served
as the Deputy U.S. Military Representative to the NATO Military
Committee from 1988 to 1989.  He has also taught American Government,
National Security Studies and Comparative Politics at the United States
Military Academy at West Point.

General McCaffrey has been decorated for valor twice with the
Distinguished Service Cross - our nation's second highest award for valor
in combat - twice with the Silver Star, three times with the Bronze Star, and
was three times awarded with the Purple Heart for wounds received in
combat.  He is the most highly decorated Army General on active duty.
General McCaffrey received the NAACP Roy Wilkins Renown Service
Award in 1991, and the U.S. Department of State's Superior Honor Award
in 1992. He is a 1964 graduate of the United States Military Academy at
West Point, and earned a Master of Arts degree in civil government from
American University.

The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was established in
1988 and is organized within the Executive Office of the President.
ONDCP's mission is to develop and coordinate the policies, goals and
objectives of the nation's drug control program for reducing the use of illicit
drugs.  The ONDCP Director is the Administration's primary spokesperson
for drug issues, and develops and coordinates the National Drug Control
Strategy.

VIOLENT CRIME COMMISSION ISSUES REPORTS

The first report of a bipartisan commission on violent crime finds that
despite a welcome decline in crime rates in many U.S. cities, the chances
that Americans will be victims of violent crime remains at an historic high.
The report also deplored the "revolving door" American criminal justice
system in which one of three criminals are supposedly under the
supervision of the justice system at the very time that they murder, rape and
commit other serious crime.

The report, entitled The State of Violent Crime in America, was issued by
the Council on Crime in America, which is co-chaired by former U.S.
Attorney General Griffin B. Bell and Former Drug Czar William J. Bennett.

According to the report, the risk of becoming a victim of violent crime today
exceeds many significant life risks, including injury in a motor vehicle
accident and death from heart disease. Much violent crime, moreover, goes
unreported. The actual number of violent crimes in 1993 (10.9 million) was
5.6 times higher than the number of violent crimes reported to the police
(1.9 million).

"This study paints a realistic and sobering picture of violent crime in
America, but it is not without its ray of hope," said Bennett. "If the success
that cities such as New York and Houston have had in reducing crime rates
teaches us anything, it is that the common sense of the American people is
right when it comes to crime: tough law enforcement is part of the solution,
not part of the problem."

The report attempts to refute some myths about incarceration rates in the
U.S. It found, for example, that the American prison system imprisons just
one criminal for every 100 violent crimes.

John Walters, who served in the Drug Czar's office during the Bush
Administration, is the Council's Executive Director. Other Council members

HOW TO KILL MANUAL CRITICIZED

The instructions are precise and clinical, with gruesome detail to clearly
explain the best way to kill.

"At least three shots should be fired to insure quick and sure death. Aim for
the head-preferably the eye sockets if you are a sharp shooter."
That's just what James Edward Perry did when he walked into a suburban
Maryland home outside Washington in 1993 and pulled the trigger of his
rifle, killing two women before suffocating a severely disabled child in an
alleged  murder-for-hire scheme.
His method, his weapon, his attempted coverup-all allegedly were straight
out of the book, Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors.

Perry was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders. But, according
to a novel lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in Maryland, the
book's publishers also
should have to pay.

"This book makes no bones about it. It is simply an instruction manual like
the one you operate your VCR with, but this one tells you how to kill
people," said John Marshall of Rockville, Md., one of the lawyers who
filed the suit.

The lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount of money from Paladin
Enterprises Inc. and its founder, Peder C. Lund, is believed to be the first
of its kind against a book publisher.

Courts have held magazines like Soldier of Fortune liable for running
advertisements offering hit-man services. But they've yet to hold publishers
responsible for the conduct of someone who learned how to commit crimes
from a book.

Already it's got some legal experts talking about dangerous precedents,
because the case, they say, raises troubling 1st Amendment issues. When
can a court punish publication of truthful information, even information that
has no redeeming value? And if you allow a lawsuit against the book
publisher in this case, what's to stop lawsuits against, for example, makers
of violent movies whose crimes are duplicated in real life?
That's not to say those distinctions can't be drawn, legal experts say, but,
as with most 1st Amendment issues, it would be tricky.

"It would require a change in 1st Amendment analysis to hold publishers
responsible for the crime that ultimately would occur," said Douglas Kmiec,
a  professor at Notre Dame University Law School in South Bend, Ind.

Perry was convicted last year of killing Mildred Horn, her quadriplegic son
and nurse Janice Saunders. He allegedly committed the crimes at the
direction of Horn's ex-husband, Lawrence Horn, who is accused of
ordering the murders to get a $1 million award his son received in a medical
malpractice lawsuit. Horn will stand trial in April.

In Perry's trial, prosecutors cited more than two dozen instances in which
he followed the book to the letter in carrying out the alleged murder-for-hire
scheme. He used the same kind of rifle, rubbed out its serial numbers and
shot the women three times each in the eyes. He also used a homemade
silencer and filed down parts of the rifle, just as the book said.

Furthermore, he allegedly followed the book's suggestions to request
money up front, make the crime scene look like a burglary and discard the
gun. But Dan Hale, a lawyer for the book's publisher, said those things
shouldn't make the Boulder, Colo.-based company liable for Perry's
actions.

"The people who are responsible are the people who committed the crime,"
Hale said. To hold otherwise, he said, would mean scaling back the 1st
Amendment.

The 1st Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and press, does
not protect all speech. The Supreme Court has carved out certain
exceptions, ruling, for example, that speech that is obscene or libelous or
creates a  clear and present danger of imminent lawless action is not always
entitled to  1st Amendment protection. As a result, the government can
restrict it or, in some cases, punish people for engaging in it.

The victims' families in this case argue that the information in "Hit Man"
should be considered unprotected speech, just like libel or defamation. "Our
argument is that there is currently no protection for speech that aids and
abets an illegal transaction," said Rod Smolla, a professor at the College of
William and Mary Law School in Williamsburg, Va., who is also
representing the families. "Because it has absolutely no value of any kind,
it is not protected under the 1st Amendment."

But finding a judge sympathetic to that argument will be difficult, Kmiec
said. Though a libel lawsuit limits speech, it is justified under the 1st
Amendment because the material is false. Here, the material is true-and its
truth only makes it more awful, Kmiec said. "The plaintiff will have to
prove not that the material is false but that it is worthless," Kmiec said.
"There's no directly applicable precedent."

But, as Kmiec noted, deciding what's worthless would be as difficult as
determining what's obscene. Courts have long struggled with trying to
figure  that one out. Hale argued that "culpability lies with Mr. Perry. And if
he conspired with Mr. Horn, he'll  probably be convicted, as well."

The courts will have to decide-meanwhile, the murder manual is still for
sale.

VIRGINIA REFORMS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

Hundreds of violent juvenile offenders would be tried automatically as
adults and face stiffer prison time under a compromise struck last month
between Gov. George Allen and state General Assembly leaders. The
compromise proposal could clear the way for overhauling Virginia's
juvenile justice system, which many say is ill-equipped to handle the
increasingly violent crimes committed by children as young as 14.

Juvenile offenders currently can serve no more than seven years in prison
and must be released when they turn 21, no matter how dangerous they are
deemed to be. Allen, who made juvenile justice reform a top priority of his
legislative agenda this year, was quick to trumpet the bipartisan compromise
at a hastily arranged news conference held just hours after striking the deal.
"This will send a message to young people that we're not just going to give
you a slap on the wrist," Allen said.

The agreement, which resolves differences between two competing plans,
calls for automatically trying as adults all juveniles 14 and older accused of
violent crimes such as murder, rape and forcible sodomy. As part of the
new compromise, juveniles charged with some less-severe  violent
crimes - robbery, carjacking, kidnapping - would be tried as adults  at the
discretion of the local prosecutor.  In addition, judges would be given new
sentencing options beyond  incarceration and probation.

Allen's budget includes $8.5 million for new boot camps and "wilderness
work camps" that are aimed at giving young offenders a second chance
through rehabilitation. Even a juvenile offender sentenced as an adult could
get his or her sentence suspended if a Circuit Court judge chooses to make
use of such alternative programs. "The compromise we offer today reflects
a concern and commitment to be responsive to the vast majority of the
young people who come before the court on minor charges and are in need
of remediation to turn their lives around," said Del. Jerrauld C. Jones, D-
Norfolk, who chaired a legislative task force and helped broker the new
compromise.

The plan also opens long-secretive juvenile court proceedings to the public
when juveniles are charged with felony crimes. Juvenile criminal history
records would also be made public when youths are convicted of felonies.
Attorney General James S. Gilmore III, who headed Allen's advisory
commission, said the compromise struck a careful balance between tougher
sentencing and increased prevention and rehabilitation programs. "We will
prevent, rescue and redirect where and when we can," Gilmore said. "But
we will also punish where we have to, with the paramount concern being
the protection of the community."

The compromise, reached in the opening weeks of the 60-day session, also
reflects the conciliatory tone Allen has taken with the legislature this year,
after watching Democrats kill most of his initiatives in last year's more
polarized session. "Obviously, you can't do things with just Republicans
alone," Allen said. "I think this is a good sign for this session of the
General Assembly."

The actual, practical effect of the plan, if approved, may be difficult to
measure and could vary by locality.  Prosecutors say many of the most
violent juveniles, such as those who commit murder, are already tried as
adults. Judges increasingly transfer teen-agers into adult courts in response
to soaring juvenile crime rates,  they say.

But administration officials say the proposed automatic transfer would target
hundreds more violent teen-agers who now escape any serious punishment
in the juvenile system.  A state study found that of 1,400 juveniles aged 14
and older charged with violent crimes in 1993, fewer than 20 percent were
tried as adults.

Under the juvenile system, the average prison time served for murder was
less than six years. Juveniles who commit rape serve less than five years on
average. And those who commit armed robbery serve about a year,
administration figures show. "I think that sends the wrong message," Allen
said. "Most people say this is just ridiculous."  But critics, who packed a
committee hearing Wednesday, said the plan offers nothing but a simplistic
"harsher-is-better" philosophy.

"That may be the stuff of good politics," said Judith Bennett, of the
Virginia Council of Churches. "It is not the stuff of which sound public
policy is made."  There is little evidence in other states to suggest that
sentencing children as adults will reduce crime, said Julie McConnell,
associate director of the American  Civil Liberties Union's Virginia chapter.

"It is an abdication of our obligation as adults to protect and guide  children
into responsible and socially productive lives," McConnell said.

But few dispute the need to crack down on violent juvenile crime, which
has increased by 36 percent since 1975, according to a study by the Joint
Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the General Assembly's
investigative  arm. To fund the plan, Allen has included $16.7 million in a
bond package that would pay for a renovation and expansion of the
Southampton Correctional  Center, which would house violent juveniles
who are sentenced as adults.

Overall, Allen's budget includes nearly $200 million to meet the rising costs
of a burgeoning juvenile justice system, although more than half that figure
comes from bonds to build new juvenile prisons.  Those bonds include
about $41.6 million in debt already authorized by the legislature to renovate
the Beaumont Correctional Center west of Richmond and build a new 180-
bed center in Chesterfield County.

JUDGE SAYS ITS OK TO RUN FROM POLICE

A federal judge who came under fire for tossing out evidence in a
Washington Heights drug case said  that there was little chance he would
reverse his ruling, and he called prosecutors' bid to get him to change his
mind a "juvenile project."

In a three-way conference call with lawyers from his chambers, Judge
Harold Baer, Jr. said he would listen to prosecutors' arguments that drug
evidence and a videotaped confession should not be thrown out in a federal
case against Carol Bayless, 41.

More than once, however, the judge made it clear that he probably would
not change his decision that the police did not have a reasonable suspicion to
pull over Ms. Bayless's car in the Washington Heights section of
Manhattan.

"While I consider it a rather juvenile project to engage in at this juncture,"
Baer said of prosecutors' bid to get him to reconsider his Jan. 24 ruling, "I
don't have a problem in letting them re-argue."

Baer went on to say: "I doubt that the government has anything new and
different that they can show me in the papers or on the law. But so far as I
am concerned, they certainly should have that opportunity."

In a ruling last week that has been criticized by many of the city's and the
state's top officials, Baer refused to allow as evidence 75 pounds of cocaine
and more than 4 pounds of heroin that the police said they had seized from
Ms. Bayless's rented car on Amsterdam Avenue at 5 a.m. on April 21. The
drugs were estimated to have a street value of $4 million.

The judge ruled that the drugs and Ms. Bayless's videotaped confession
were not admissible as evidence because officers stopped her car without
reasonable suspicion.

An officer who saw Ms. Bayless said he suspected criminal activity in part
because four men who had loaded two duffel bags into her trunk ran away
after seeing him.

But Baer, who served on the Mollen Commission, which investigated
police corruption, said that it was not necessarily suspicious behavior for
people to flee the police in Washington Heights, a neighborhood where, he
said, residents regarded police officers as "corrupt, abusive, and violent."

"Had the men not run when the cops began to stare at  them, it would have
been unusual," Baer wrote.

The ruling immediately touched off a firestorm of criticism from politicians
and law enforcement officials, and quickly became fodder for newspaper
editorials and radio talk shows. Critics accused Baer of being more
concerned about protecting criminals than protecting the public, and said
that his comments about the police unfairly maligned hard-working, honest
officers. Police Commissioner William J. Bratton went so far as to say the
judge was "living in a fantasy land."

Baer, a 1994 Clinton administration appointee to the federal bench, has
repeatedly declined to speak to the public or the press about his ruling and
its potential impact on law enforcement efforts. During the 10-minute
hearing no one mentioned the publicity or criticism that the ruling has
attracted for more than a week.

But the judge's remarks are the first indication of how he would view
prosecutors' efforts to persuade him to change his mind. His remarks were
included in a 10-page transcript of the hearing released late on Friday.

A spokesman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the judge's latest remarks
were relayed  to the mayor, who had harshly criticized the judge's original
decision.

"The mayor is hopeful that Judge Baer's decision will be reversed so a
confessed drug dealer will not go free," the spokesman, Colleen Roche,
said on Friday night. Ms. Roche added that the mayor would not
specifically comment on what the judge said.

A spokesman for Gov. George Pataki said the governor would have no
comment beyond his earlier criticism of the ruling.

In a conference call prosecutors asked the judge for more time to prepare
papers on the issue. But Jay Holtmeier, assistant U.S. attorney, said
prosecutors plan to ask Bear to reopen the hearing on the motion to
suppress evidence.
"Reopening the hearing had never been an item that I had focused on at all,"
Baer told him. "So I am not clear how I come out."

Ramon W. Pagan, Ms. Bayless's lawyer, argued that the prosecutors
should not be permitted to ask Baer to reconsider his decision.

"I think they are trying to create something which is very new and unusual,"
Pagan said. "If they lose a case, they want to redo it again and do an instant
replay, without the direction of the Court of Appeals, and that is not the
way." Baer said prosecutors still had seveal more days to file their motion
for reconsideration.

CRIME DISCUSSED AT STATE OF UNION ADDRESS

President Clinton, preparing to embark on his re-election campaign,
dedicated a significant chunk of his State of the Union Address to crime
issues.

He said during the speech, "At last we have begun to find the way to reduce
crime, forming community partnerships with local police forces to catch
criminals and to prevent crime. This strategy, called community policing is
clearly working," Clinton said.

He cited declining Violent crime rates. In New York City, murders are
down 25%, in St. Louis 18%, in Seattle 32%.  But, he said,  we still have a
long way to go before our streets are safe and our and our people are free of
fear.  He told the audience of Members of Congress that the Crime Bill of
1994 "is critical to the success of community policing. It provides funds for
100,000 new police in communities of all sizes. We are already a third of
the way there and I challenge Congress to finish the job.  Let us stick with
the strategy that's working, and keep the crime rate coming down."

Clinton also asked all Americans to respect and support our law
enforcement officers, and told police, "our children need you as role models
and heroes. Don't let them down."

In spite of its unpopularity with the current Congress, Clinton reported that
the Brady Bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal records
from buying guns. He also said that the assault weapons ban is keeping 19
kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs. "I challenge the
Congress to keep those laws on the books," he said.

The President also announced several new initiatives. "Our next step in the
fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we once took on the Mob. I
am directing the FBI and other investigative agencies to target gangs that
involve juveniles in violent crime and to seek authority to prosecute - as
adults - teenagers who maim and kill like adults," the
President said.

He also offered hope to public housing residents who have been frustrated
with the long legal process usually required for drug-related evictions.
"From now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and peddle drugs
should be: One strike and you're out," the President said.

Clinton challenged every state to match federal policy, to assure that
serious, violent criminals serve at least 85% of their sentence.

However, the President also emphasized the importance of drug and crime
prevention programs. He said more police and punishment are important,
but they're not enough. "We have got to keep more of our young people out
of trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington, but
developed in communities.  I challenge all of our communities, all of our
adults, to give these children futures to say yes to. And I challenge
Congress not to abandon the Crime Bill's support of these grass-roots
prevention efforts."

Clinton added that to reduce crime and violence, we have to reduce the drug
problem. "The challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to their
children openly and firmly, and embraces our churches and synagogues,
our youth groups and our schools. I challenge Congress not to cut our
support for drug-free schools. People like D.A.R.E. officers are making a
real impression on grade school children that will give them the strength to
say no when the time comes," he said.

The day after the speech Clinton traveled to Louisville, Kentucky to test his
anti-crime themes on the road. Clinton does not plan to officially announce
his re-election bid until spring. But the State of the Union speech to
Congress and the next day's trip to a state that will be an election-year
battleground effectively launched his campaign.
In a roundtable discussion with police and community leaders, he argued
that Republican efforts to transform the current COPS program into a block
grant program for states should be defeated.

The split over community policing underscores the philosophical divide
between Clinton and the Republican-led Congress over spending and tax
priorities that's led to the budget stalemate.

But Wednesday House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Republicans are ready
to take Clinton up on his budget compromise offer. He suggested that the
White House and Congress agree to a budget "downpayment" of around
$100 billion.

RAP GROUPS TO RAISE MONEY FOR SLAIN OFFICER:

On Sunday, February 18, members of Philadelphia's hip hop community
and Philadelphia police officers will host a benefit for slain police officer
Lauretha Vaird's family. Organized by members of the rap group Da Fat Cat
Clique, the benefit is being held to raise money for the slain officer's family
and to forge a relationship between hip hoppers and cops.  "Too often
people think that rappers are just about violence and crime.  Well, many of
us have jobs and we don't condone nor endorse cop killing.  We think that
this benefit will give us a chance to let the public know that we respect
police officers and that all of us are not negative," said Criz, of Da Fat Cat
Clique.  Several important Philadelphians have been invited to attend the
benefit including Mayor Ed Rendell and Police Commissioner Richard
Neal. There will be performances by rap artists such as Jackal the Bear, Da
Youngstas (Illy Funkstas), The Man They Call Lux, Ital Tha Ruffian and
many more.  The minimum donation to attend the event is only $5 and all
proceeds will benefit the Lauretha Vaird Scholarship Fund.  For more

DETROIT'S POLICE AND SEARS TO HELP HOMELESS:

The Detroit Police Department and Sears announced on February 2 they
would commemorate St. Valentine's Day by helping the homeless.
Commander Ronald Haddad of the Detroit Police Department and Robert
Haddad, Sears district human resource manager, joined forces to create the
"Have a Heart For Detroit," program that involves 15 area Sears stores and
local law enforcement agencies.  Each store will set up drop-off stations in
the package pick-up area to collect used clothing and non-perishable food.
The program runs from Feb. 5 through Feb. 14. "Our offices are dedicated
to community policing and to improving the quality of life for all citizens,"
said Commander Ronald Haddad.  More than 5,300 Sears associates in the
Detroit area are contributing their time and energy to support this drive.  In
addition to the Detroit Police Department, the 314th military intelligence
battalion, a U.S. Army Reserve unit, has volunteered their logistical
expertise as well as offered their base as a collection center. Sydney Boggs,
a Detroit-based candy maker, is providing "A Taste of Detroit" candy heart
to volunteers. Organizations wishing to contribute to the Detroit Police

HUGE FORENSIC SCIENCE CENTER TO OPEN IN FLORIDA:

A new forensic science center is expected to bring thousands of crime lab
workers to St. Petersburg, Florida for training. The National Forensic
Science Technology Center has officially opened for business at St.
Petersburg Junior College's Allstate Center.  It is likely to attract more than
1,000 visitors this year and far more in future years, said Dr. Joan Wood,
Pinellas-Pasco medical examiner and  president of the new center's board of
directors. She said job opportunities  in forensics have been expanding, but
training programs have failed to keep  pace with the demand. "I think we
have a tremendous future ahead of us," she said. This week more than 100
people, most of them from out of state, attended the center's inaugural
three-day workshop, which featured Bruce Weir, a DNA expert who
testified in the O.J. Simpson trial.  Eventually the center could be offering a
workshop every other week, Wood said. It also will be involved in joint
educational programs with the junior college, the University of South
Florida and the University of Central Florida. Other activities will include
research, creation of teaching videos and  computer discs, and development
of industry standards. The center will have a  director and a small support
staff, Wood said.

ATLANTA TARGETS VIOLENT CRIME FOR OLYMPICS:

Atlanta, ranked the most violent U.S. city for the second straight year in a
new survey, is battling to cleanse its image ahead of playing host to the
world for the Olympic Games.  City officials said a private survey that
named Atlanta as the most dangerous U.S. city in violent crime such as
murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, was using outdated statistics
that don't reflect improvements in 1995.  The Morgan Quitno survey, based
on 1994 FBI crime statistics, found Atlanta for the second year in a row to
be the least safe of the 100 largest U.S. cities, or those with more than
100,000 people. The Atlanta Olympics, from July 19 to August 4 this year,
will be the biggest ever, bringing together more than 10,000 athletes from
197 countries. Atlanta officials boast that it will be the most compact Games
in history, with most events and the Olympic Village concentrated in a small
downtown area. But that area is in a high-crime part of the city center where
local residents fear to tread at night. Panhandlers and the homeless are a
frequent sight in the area dubbed "the Olympic Ring." Local journalist Dave
Kindred commented that the Olympic Ring was already crowned with
barbed wire, even at Coca-Cola's world headquarters.

COMMUNITY POLICING BRINGS HOPE TO BAKERSFIELD:

Tony Martinez, a community services specialist with the Bakersfield Police
Department, who has been coordinating city support for projects that
increase neighborhood pride and decrease neighborhood crime. Since April,
Martinez has roamed the neighborhood west of Lakeview Avenue in a van
that touts his Community Oriented and Problem Solving program (COPS).
He has helped set up Neighborhood Watch, clean up vacant lots and
houses, install and replace street lights, remove abandoned vehicles and
increase street police patrols. In addition, the city closed off Gorrill and
Ralston streets at Lakeview  Avenue three years ago to reduce pedestrian
accidents and street-corner drug  dealing. One effect has been that since
June, the neighborhood around Gorrill Street has had only four burglaries,
Martinez said. That's remarkable because it would not have been unusual
for the neighborhood to have four burglaries a  week, he said. "It is the
people in the neighborhood who are taking care of each other," Martinez
said.  Citizens credit Martinez with helping to make changes in the
neighborhood. "Now there is someone to talk to, to listen to our problems
and explain what can be done" one resident said.

DEPARTING DRUG CZAR SLAMS ADIDAS SPORTS SHOE:

As one of his last actions as the nation's National Drug Control Policy
Director, White House Drug Czar Lee Brown is calling on athletic shoe
company giant Adidas to recall or stop selling its "The Hemp" shoe. The
shoe had ben scheduled for distribution to its vast network of retailers over
the next few months. "Hemp" is a street slang for marijuana. In a statement
amplifying a letter to Adidas America President Steve Wynne, Brown said.
"The people at this shoe company apparently think this is cute, but it is
really quite deadly--especially at a time in which more and more of our
young people do not fear illegal drugs and as a result are using them.
Moreover, it has been widely reported that the shoe" had previously been
called the Chronic--another street name for marijuana. Wynne's response to
Brown stated that "Hemp is not marijuana." But Brown, in a second letter
replied, "You fail to get the point. It doesn't matter what the your shoe is
made of -- the question is what you call it." Brown also charged that Adidas
shows a blatant disregard of the fact that we now have a crisis among kids
who think using marijuana is the thing to do. To receive more information

FEDERAL JUDGE HALTED SALE OF DRUG DETECTION DEVICE:

A federal judge last month temporarily halted manufacture and sale of a
device sold to schools, prisons, airports and law enforcement as a drug and
explosives detector. Government tests indicated it's a fake. FBI agent
Norman Townsend told a federal judge that 1,000 Quadro Trackers, also
known as Quadro Positive Molecular Locators, have been sold or ordered
for $395 to $8,000 apiece. But he said analysis by FBI Laboratory
technicians and by the Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratories
show the device is nothing more than a hollow plastic box attached to a
retractable transistor radio antenna. A "chip" inside was found to be two
pieces of plastic surrounding "a small piece of polymer coated white paper,
similar to a candy bar wrapper," Townsend wrote in an affidavit. At the
request of the Justice Department, which is conducting a fraud
investigation, U.S. District Judge Thad Heartfield in Beaumont, Texas,
signed the restraining order against Quadro Corp. of Harleyville, S.C., its
Texas subsidiary and four company officers. The judge found "probable
cause to believe that defendants are engaged in mail and wire fraud." A
schools use package was priced at $995 and law enforcement packages
ranged from $1,145 to $5,000. Locator cards to be inserted in the device
were priced at $250 for heroin and $25 for golf balls, Townsend said.

POLICING DRUG HOT SPOTS IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE:

In a two page Research Preview National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Director,
Jeremy Travis, describes and summarizes the results of recent research on
police efforts to target drug hot spots. In 1990 the  NIJ initiated the Drug
Market Analysis Program (DMA) in order to develop strategies for
addressing street level drug problems and encourage innovations in
geographic analysis of crime. In Jersey City, New Jersey, one of five DMA
demonstration sides, an evaluation was conducted in 1993 of an innovative
drug enforcement strategy that focused on hot spots of drug activity. This
study found consistent and strong effects of the experimental policing
strategy on disorder related emergency calls for service. The data suggested
that surrounding areas of the hot spots also benefited. To receive a copy of

DUF DATA FOR 1994 SHOWS COCAINE USE STILL HIGH:

Recently released findings from the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program
for 1994 show that despite slight decreases, cocaine remains one of the
most commonly used drugs among adult male arrestees. The percentage of
males testing positive for cocaine in 1994 ranged from 19% (in San Jose) to
68% (in Manhattan). Cocaine positive rates for females ranges from 19%
(in San Diego) to 80% (in Manhattan). While use of cocaine has declined in
the surveyed household and student populations, similar declines have not
been found among arrestees.  Other cities with more than fifty percent of
male arrestees testing positive for cocaine include Atlanta, Birmingham,
Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, and St. Louis. This information was
supplied from the Center for Substance Abuse Research at the University of
Maryland at College Park. To get on their fax list call (301) 403-8329. To

SENATORS CALL FOR CRACKDOWN ON MEXICO:

Saying it is high time for Mexico to crack down on drug trafficking into the
United States, Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Alfonse M. D'Amato,
R-N.Y., last month announced plans for legislation aimed at pressuring
Mexico for increased cooperation. The action comes as the Clinton
administration is poised to extend for  six months Mexico's $20 billion in
U.S. loan guarantees. President Clinton provided the guarantees on his own
authority last Jan. 31, after lawmakers balked at his request that Congress
authorize a $40 billion bailout. "The measures my colleague and I are
introducing are meant as a shot across the bow to the government of
Mexico," Feinstein said. "These measures... should send the signal that this
Congress is prepared to back up the president's effort in the strongest
possible terms if Mexico's actions do not match their words in the war on
drugs." The senators measures would tie the six-month extension of the
loan guarantee to Mexico to that country's efforts to curb drug trafficking.
Specifically, Feinstein said Mexican officials would have to comply with a
list of 10 requirements such as meeting extradition requests, prosecuting
local government officials for accepting graft, strengthening the prohibition
on money laundering and regulating chemicals used to produce
methamphetamine and other narcotics. Another measure would suspend
trucking applications from Mexico under border crossing provisions in the
North American Free Trade Agreement until Mexico improves its safety
record. D'Amato, chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs Committee, said his panel would begin holding hearings and
marking up the draft bill in early March.

MEXICO ARRESTS AND EXTRADITES DRUG TRAFFICKER:

On January 15 the Government of Mexico arrested Juan Garcia Abrego and
the next day expelled him from the country. Garcia Abrego was flown to
Houston and taken into federal custody to face an indictment filed in
September, 1993 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Texas. The indictment charges that Garcia Abrego is the leader of one of the
most powerful drug trafficking organizations in Mexico, which, while
operating on both sides of the border, is responsible for transporting tons of
cocaine into the United States for the Cali Cartel. The indictment further
alleges that Garcia Abrego authorized acts of violence, including murder, to
promote drug activities. Garcia Abrego, who faces a life sentence if he is
convicted, was placed on the FBI's list of "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives" in
March of 1995. Attorney General Janet Reno in a statement congratulated
Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Jose Angel Gurria and Attorney
General Antonio Lozano Garcia for the capture of Garcia Abrego and the
"expeditious manner in which the government of Mexico achieved his
removal from Mexico to the United States."

CALI MONEY LAUNDERERS INDICTED IN NEW JERSEY:

U.S. authorities indicted 14 people accused of laundering $60 million for
the Cali drug cartel and seized large amounts of cash when they arrested
some of the suspects on February 6. In what prosecutors called the biggest
money laundering case brought in New Jersey, special agents of the U.S.
Customs Service and the Internal Revenue Service arrested suspects in three
states beginning the night of February 5, officials said.  Special Agent Dan
Holmes of the U.S. Customs Service said the arrests were made in New
Jersey, New York and Florida and at least $300,000 in cash had been
confiscated. U.S. Attorney Faith Hochberg said in a statement that the
government would ask to have the suspects held without bail because they
pose a high risk of flight. All face a 20-year prison term and a heavy fine if
convicted.  The indictment said the 14 suspects operated through three front
companies, using money transfer agents and banks over more than two
years to launder cash obtained from illegal narcotic sales in the United States
back to Cali, Colombia. One of the companies named was Latelco, with
offices in West New York, New Jersey, Miami and Cali, Colombia. It
ostensibly sold telephone debit cards. A second was a travel and money
transfer agency in Jersey City.

CRIMINAL CHARGES TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST SAMPER:

Colombia's chief prosecutor was quoted on February 6 as saying that he
would file criminal charges against President Ernesto Samper because of his
alleged links to drug lords. The RCN and Caracol radio networks said
Prosecutor-General Alfonso Valdivieso announced his plan to file charges
during closed-door talks with members of the Committee of Accusations of
the House of Representatives. Valdivieso could not be reached to confirm
the reports. The committee, the only body formally authorized to investigate
a sitting president, is preparing to reopen a probe into charges that Samper
accepted up to $6 million in Cali cartel drug money to finance his 1994
election campaign. The congressional panel cleared Samper of any
wrongdoing last December after a four-month probe into the campaign
finance scandal his government has been embroiled in since last summer.
But Samper himself asked it to reopen its investigation last week after
Fernando Botero-his former defence minister and campaign boss -
charged that the President personally approved the use of drug money to
bankroll his campaign.

JEWELRY TRADE SHOW AVOIDS PUBLICITY DUE TO CRIME:

After a jewelry trade show participant from Hong Kong was shot and
robbed of nearly $1 million in diamonds outside a midtown Manhattan
hotel, his fellow jewelers hustled their expensive wares into the Jacob K.
Javits Convention Center for a trade show so exclusive it has been almost a
secret.  According to a report from the New York Times, the JA
International Jewelry Show displays no signs outside, disseminates no
general publicity, posts no show dates in lists of upcoming events and
sends out literature in plain brown envelopes. The  reason for the secrecy is
the concern that public notice would weaken security, though none of the
press officers from the parent company, Blenheim Group U.S.A., would
acknowledge this. Many participants covered the badges identifying them as
part of the show, which is intended only for those in the industry. Police
said that they had not yet made any arrests in the shooting. At the Javits
Center a steady stream of armored cars, vans and taxis dropped off
exhibitors bearing bulky crates, bulging briefcases and duffel bags like the
one stolen earlier. Security was heavy. But one show participant said, fear
of theft, combined with other local inconveniences, was causing the show
to lose ground to the June show in Las Vegas. "People hate the cold, the
snow, the theft, the huge cost of hotel rooms. New York has a pretty lousy
reputation."

DEMOCRATS ATTACK NEW YORK'S MAYOR FOR FOCUS ON
CRIME:

Democrats have begun to turn the mayor's success in lowering the crime
rate against him, ridiculing him for concentrating on little else. City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone delivered an unusual reproach to Giuliani in his
annual address to the Council last month, charging that on issues like
education, housing, and health, Giuliani had been "a very good mayor - on
crime." The crime rate may once have been the voters' top priority, but
some New Yorkers are asking "What have you done for me lately?"
Giuliani seemed conscious of the need to broaden his portfolio when, after
the beating death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, he announced that he would
reorganize the Child Welfare Administration with the same energy and
commitment he had earlier applied to the Police Department. Then he went
further, proclaiming in his budget message last week that his top priority
was protecting the rights of society's most vulnerable, a category he said
included troubled children, the elderly, the sick and the handicapped. To
help pay for some of his new priorities, he agreed to trim the police force by
1,500 officers. Caught off guard, social-welfare advocates praised the
police cut but remained skeptical of the mayor's real intentions, particularly
if budget cuts continue to grow over all, as now seems likely. The budget
plan for next year, for example, includes a $160 million cut to the Board of
Education, and projects the removal of more than 275,000 people from the
welfare rolls.

VETERANS HOSPITALS NOW PROVIDING DRUG TREATMENT:

The Department of Veterans Affairs is best known for its network of
hospitals, which continues to expand despite a decline in the population of
veterans and despite health care trends that are forcing many other hospitals
to close. But now the department's insulation from the fiscal and political
pressures confronting the rest of the government has helped give it an
important new role as an agency that cares for the poor.  And a poor veteran
often gets assistance that a welfare recipient accustomed to nothing more
than cash or food stamps might find lavish.  "If you're a vet," said Martha
Burt, director of social service research at the Urban Institute, a
Washington-based research organization, "you have a resource that a lot of
other people don't have." With the plunge in the number of war-maimed
veterans treated at the agency's 173 hospitals, the VA has been turning more
of its attention to veterans who are among the nation's drug-addicted or
indigent, mentally ill or physically disabled. To qualify, most need only
have put in some time in the service, in combat or not, in wartime or
peacetime. "If you serve 180 days on active duty," said one Republican
congressional aide who specializes in veterans issues, "and if for whatever
reason you do not succeed in life, you get this complete safety net." As a
result, a department that is the nation's largest employer of doctors and
nurses has also become the largest employer of social workers, with 4,241
on the payroll last year.

NOBEL WINNERS TAKE ANTI-VIOLENCE CAMPAIGN TO U.S.:

In a bid to combat teen violence three Nobel peace laureates will take their
message of non-violence to young people, Nobel laureate Betty Williams
announced last month. ``We're going to change things for the young people
of America,'' said Williams, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in
1977 along with Mairead Corrigan Maguire for their work in Northern
Ireland.  Williams next month will kick off in Denver what is expected to be
a five-year educational program known as PeaceJam. Williams later said
gang members will be recruited to attend the weekend conference in late
March. ``We're going to bring them in. We're going to go out and look for
them,'' she said after a press conference to announce the program.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who was awarded the peace prize in 1984 for
his fight against apartheid in South Africa, and the Dalai Lama of Tibet who
received the prize in 1989, will attend similar conferences in Denver later
this year, organizers said.

ENVIRONMENTAL HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS
(EPA)

Scope:  The Environmental Protection Agency is inviting
proposals to accelerate the evolution of high performance
technologies and their applications to environmental
management.

Deadline:  Feb. 29.

Funds:  $3 million for projects ranging from $100,000 to
$200,000 a year for up to three years.

Eligibility:  Generally, colleges and universities and
nonprofit research organizations and consortia.

Areas:  EPA is looking for projects that target research on
problem-solving environments, parallel algorithms and data
access and analysis techniques.  Grantees should demonstrate
in a results-oriented testbed that specifically addresses
cross-media ecosystem management capabilities to support
community-based environmental assessments.

Proposals on problem-solving environments should explore
conceptual data models that encompass all data types
required for cross-media environment assessment and
decision-making; explore and evaluate alternative techniques
for fully integrating geospatial analysis, environmental
modeling and object-oriented databases involving very large
three dimensional, time and space varying data; develop
scalable parallel input/output (I/O) techniques for object
oriented data bases, I/O mechanisms to support data
reordering, fast queries over distributed databases and
archives and I/O for binary large objects; and develop
reusable object-model-based class libraries for parallel
numerical solvers and science processes related to cross-
media modeling, uncertainty and risk assessment.

Parallel algorithms projects should evaluate performance
characteristics of alternative domain decomposition
approaches and scalable parallel algorithms for multi-media
(air, water, soil, etc.); develop scalable parallel
algorithms for adaptive grid approaches and evaluate the
preservation of accuracy with the interaction of regular and
irregular grid systems in the context of cross-media
environmental assessments; or devise methods for
optimization problems involving non-linear processes,
develop scalable parallel algorithms for efficient
implementation and explore the accuracy of sampling
strategies for non-linear response space.

EPA also is interested in proposals that develop techniques
for exploring multiple-scales and cross-media environmental
data, including high performance data assimilation
techniques supported by scalable parallel I/O systems to
enable integration of remote sensing data into predictive
models; multivariate analysis and visualization techniques
over three dimensional space and time; and techniques for
desktop virtual environments for analysis of time sequences
of three-dimensional environmental data.

SMALL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:  NEW YORK STATE (HUD)

Scope:  The Housing and Urban Development Department is
inviting proposals for small community development projects
that focus on creating or expanding jobs, meeting housing
needs or addressing local public facilities needs.  (Dec. 28
Federal Register)

Deadline:  March 13.

Funds:  $50 million for comprehensive multiyear projects for
up to $5 million and three years; and $600,000 for single-
purpose grants.

Previous recipients of two- or three-year commitments at
lower levels may submit new multi-year applications and
"trade-up" to the higher three-year amount.

Eligibility:  Units of general local government in New York
state, excluding metropolitan cities, urban counties, units
of government participating in urban counties or
metropolitan cities and certain American Indian tribes.

STATE COURTS GRANTS (SJI)

Scope:  The State Justice Institute is inviting proposals
for state court-related improvement projects under final
fiscal 1996 grant program guidelines.  (Dec. 14 Federal
Register)

Deadline:  Feb. 14 for full proposals.  SJI is not seeking
concept papers this year.  For scholarships, deadlines are
Feb. 1, for programs from April 13 and July 12; April 15 for
programs from July 13 and September 30; and July 15 for
programs from Oct. 1 and Dec. 31.

Funds:  SJI estimates it will have $6 million to $9 million,
but its fiscal 1996 appropriation still is pending in
Congress.  SJI awards several types of grants, including
project grants up to $200,000 for education, research,
evaluation, demonstrations and technical assistance.  SJI
estimates it will have $400,000 in fiscal 1996 for technical
assistance grants of $30,000 each for state or local courts
to engage outside experts; $175,000 for curriculum
adaptation grants of up to $20,000 each for state and local

Eligibility:  State and local courts, nonprofit
organizations, higher education institutions and other
organizations with expertise in judicial administration.

Areas:  SJI is looking for projects that formulate new
procedures and techniques, or creatively enhance existing
arrangements to improve courts; address aspects of state
judicial systems that especially need attention; have
national significance in terms of their impact or may be
replicated in other states; and create and disseminate
products that effectively transfer information and ideas
developed to relevant audiences in state and local judicial
systems or provide relevant technical assistance.

Special interest categories for this year include research
and other projects to improve public confidence in courts
and education and training for judges and other key court
personnel.  Proposals related to public confidence include

TOOLS OF THE TRADE: THE FEDERAL REGISTER

The Federal Register -- the federal government's 60-year-old
regulatory affairs reporter -- remains a key grantseeking
tool, even in the electronic age.

The Register last month announced free access to its own
searchable electronic version.

And despite increased use of the Internet by agencies to
advertise funding opportunities directly, the Register is
the forum of choice for certain health-related funders.

In addition to running grant notices, the Register also
updates readers daily on critical rules, regulations and
actions that shape grant competitions.

By following official developments, grantseekers can stay on
top of changes that could affect their eligibility under a
grant program or effect new procedures and requirements.

In its electronic form, readers can have a custom-tailored
Register.  Instead of slogging
through pages of extraneous text dealing with agencies in
which readers may have no interest, readers can key into
only the information they need.

"It's what they've always asked for," says Richard
Claypoole, director of the Federal Register.


And the electronic version has caught on, he says.  Even
before the Register went public,  subscribers logged 558,369
document retrievals from November to December.

In whatever form, grantseekers can use the Federal Register
to:

*  Mine grant nuggets:  The Health Resources and Services
Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Energy
Department regularly use the Federal Register to announce
grant competitions.

Browsers will find health-related Education Department
notices and health and life science notices from the
Agriculture Department and the Environmental Protection
Agency.*  Check on winners:  A few agencies, such as the
Housing and Urban Development Department, use the Federal
Register to announce recent awards.  Announcements are
occasional, but they can provide insights about program
constituents and reveal subgrant and subcontracting
possibilities.

*  Respond to proposed program rules and funding priorities:
Laws creating grant programs often require agencies to
publish regulations before getting down to grantmaking.
Grantseekers can influence program direction by commenting
on the proposals appearing in the Federal Register.*  Keep
up with grant-related policies:  The Register provides the
full text on government-wide policies affecting grants and
contracts, such as Office of Management and Budget circulars
related to university research costs.*In fact, revisions to
OMB Circular A-21, which deals with university costs, could
hit the Register late this month. *  Learn about meetings:
Agencies publish announcements for meetings, ranging from
preapplication workshops and advisory group sessions to
policy-setting forums, including meetings on grantseekers'
home turf.  Notices specify when and where meetings will be
held and which parts will be open to the public.

But the Federal Register also has its drawbacks -- for hard
copy and electronic users.  Agencies used to soliciting
grant applications via the Register sometimes bypass the
publication these days, finding it faster and easier to go
with electronic announcements.

For example, EPA's 1996 grant competition, announced on the
Internet last month, has yet to make it into the Register.
Unless their announcements have regulatory impact, says
Claypoole, agencies are not required to publish application
notices in the Register.

And whether users are hard copy or on-screen readers, they
routinely must trudge through pages of often confusing
legalese.  To make things easier, the Federal Register
office regularly holds workshops on how to use the Federal
Register system.  The 1996 schedule includes workshops in
and out of Washington.

Other efforts to make life easier include a new column on
regulations taking effect that day and a daily reminder of
impending closing dates for comments on proposed rules.

FOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY:  WHO DOES WHAT IN THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-19A and GAO/RCED-91-19B
Pages:  32 and 119

Today's federal food safety and quality regulatory system is
fragmented and complex, consisting of as many as 35
different laws and involving 12 federal agencies. The first
volume of this report provides an overall perspective on
federal efforts to ensure food safety and quality. GAO
discusses (1) the statutory responsibilities, programs,
activities, staffing, and budget of the federal agencies
involved with food safety and quality; (2) the inter-agency
agreements used by the agencies to cooperate in meeting
their statutory duties; (3) the ways in which funding and
staffing levels have changed during the 1980s relative to
the agencies' work loads; and (4) the issues that federal
officials believe will be critical for food safety and
quality in the 1990s. The second volume contains a more
detailed description of the food safety and quality
activities of the 12 agencies that were the focus of the
first volume. These 12 agencies include the following: Food
and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control
(HHS); Agricultural Marketing Service, Federal Grain
Inspection Service, Food Safety and Inspection Service,
Agricultural Research Service, and Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (USDA); the Environmental Protection
Agency; the National Marine Fisheries Service (Department of
Commerce); Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
(Department of the Treasury); U.S. Customs Service; and
Federal Trade Commission.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE:  STRATEGIC MARKETING NEEDED
TO LEAD AGRIBUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-22
Pages:  46

GAO found that U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies
rarely use strategic marketing--a range of practices that
identify consumer needs and develop products and delivery
systems to satisfy those needs--to help U.S. agribusiness
better compete in both export and domestic markets. Although
USDA agencies are reacting positively to some of the
challenges of strategic marketing, GAO concludes that
overall the Department is not prepared to guide agribusiness
in a market-driven economy. Important marketing policies,
practices, and skills are lacking within individual
agencies, impairing USDA'S ability to fulfill a leadership
role. For example, three of the four agencies GAO examined
do not coordinate their program planning or systematically
exchange information.  These factors have contributed to
USDA's inability to develop a plan for marketing as a
coordinated, Department-wide issue under the new management-
by-objective system.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE:  FARM AGENCIES' FIELD
STRUCTURE NEEDS MAJOR OVERHAUL

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-9
Pages:  60

The U.S. Department of Agriculture runs its farm programs
and services through one of the federal government's largest
and most decentralized field structures. This structure also
dates to the 1930s and reflects the more limited
transportation and communication systems in use at that
time. Given changing patterns in American agriculture and
mounting constraints on federal spending, GAO looked for
ways to improve the overall management of USDA's field
structure. GAO found that USDA can save millions of dollars
while maintaining or improving operational effectiveness by
(1) more aggressively pursuing incremental improvements
through field office collocations and consolidations and (2)
restructuring to provide a more flexible, integrated field
organization GAO notes the likelihood of many sources of
opposition to the restructuring of USDA field operations. As
a result, USDA Will need to engage its grass roots staff,
top management, farm clients, and Congress in updating its
current structure to one that can effectively deliver
services into the next century.

THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1991:  SCORING OF GSA LEASE-
PURCHASES

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-44
Pages:  7

This report discusses differences in how the Office of
Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office
did budgetary scoring for lease-purchase contracts at the
General Services Administration. OMB'S treatment produced
higher outlay estimates for fiscal year 1991 than did CBO'S.
GAO believes that the key to resolving the issue would be
for the administration and Congress to reconsider the matter
in light of a common set of assumptions about the contracts'
financing and the required scoring rule. GAO understands
that the administration will be initiating discussions with
Congress to develop a mutually acceptable
way of resolving the issue.  GAO believes that this is an
appropriate course of action.

BUDGET ISSUES:  EFFECTS OF THE FISCAL YEAR 1990 SEQUESTER

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-21
Pages:  20

This report examines the effects of the fiscal year 1990
sequester on five federal agencies  the Department of Health
and Human Services, IRS, the Department of Education, the
Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. GAO found that the 1990
sequester had only a minimal effect on the five agencies.
The five agencies actually lost less than 1.4 percent of
their final budget authority because (1) growth in agency
appropriations offset sequester reductions and (2)
appropriations enacted after the sequestration were
partially exempt from that process. As a result, agencies
absorbed the sequester reductions by postponing program
expansions and improvements rather than by cutting core
services. Final 1990 figures peg the deficit at $220.4
billion, or $120.4 billion over the target level. Had OMB
predicted the need for a $120 billion sequester in its
earlier sequestration reports, GAO believes that meaningful
nonsequester deficit reduction might have been achieved in
the face of massive, across-the-board cuts. GAO continues to
believe that sequestration alone will not eliminate the
deficit. Instead, a combination of good faith negotiations,
political leadership, and compromise on difficult policy
matters is needed.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:  OVERSIGHT OF BLOCK GRANT MONITORING
NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-23
Pages:  14

Local governments rely on the Community Development Block
Grant program to help meet locally defined community
development needs, including the creation of decent housing
and the expansion of economic opportunities. However, the
Office of Inspector General found that many problems plagued
the administration of grantees' programs. GAO reviewed three
Department of Housing and Urban Development field offices
(Baltimore, Maryland; Columbus, Ohio; and Detroit, Michigan)
to determine how they monitored entitlement grantees of
Community Development Block Grants. GAO found that
weaknesses in HUD'S guidance for monitoring entitlement
grantees may have contributed to inadequate supervisory and
evidentiary control practices.  Without adequate supervisory
and evidentiary controls over its monitoring program, HUD
cannot ensure that management problems are detected or t hat
staff do not duplicate previous work. In addition, without
using information found in Office of Inspector General
reports when planning their monitoring, field offices may
not be using their limited resources most effectively.

STAFFORD STUDENT LOANS:  MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOANS
AWARDED TO INELIGIBLE BORROWERS

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-7
Pages:  32

Due to internal control weaknesses, GAO has cited the
Stafford Student Loan Program, the largest government
program for student loans, as one of 14 areas at high-risk
for mismanagement, fraud, and abuse. A main problem at the
Stafford Student Loan Program is the lack of an information
system to protect the government's interests; in fiscal year
1990, more than half the program's funds--$2.4 billion--were
used to repay defaulted loans. Today the Department is
running a multi-million-dollar, commercial-type loan
operations with a data system containing incomplete,
inaccurate, and unreliable information. Consequently, the
Department has no way of knowing whether (1) student loan
defaulters are trying to obtain new loans or (2) borrowers
have exceeded legal loan limits. GAO found that loan
defaulters may have obtained about million in new loans, and
that students have received million of dollar in loans over
the legal limits. While the total impact of such abuses is
unclear because the data are so poor, GAO believes that a
significant problem exists--one that is costing the federal
government millions of dollars in interest subsidies and
additional defaulted loans. The Department of Education
plans to install a new data base in 1993. Until then GAO
believes that the Department needs to do much more to (1)
improve the accuracy and completeness of the current data
base and (2) make this information available to guaranty
agencies. GAO concludes that much is at stake. If the abuses
go unchecked, they will continue to corrode the financial
aid system and ultimately deprive eligible students of the
money they need to finance their education.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:  IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED IN ENFORCING HEALTH
INSURANCE CONTINUATION REQUIREMENTS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-37
Pages:  12

GAO reviewed the Department of Labor's and the Internal
Revenue Service's enforcement of the health insurance
continuation requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). This legislation
requires firms employing 20 or more employees and offering a
group health insurance plan to provide employees and their
families the option of continued coverage in cases of job
loss, death, or divorce. This report discusses (1) Labor and
IRS efforts to help private individuals who bring cases of
alleged noncompliance by employers to their attention, (2)
procedures for investigating these allegations, and (3)
enforcement history. Both IRS and Labor provide information
about COBRA to those who inquire, and Labor will contact
employers to help employees obtain benefits. However, if
employers refuse to provide benefits, IRS cannot and Labor
generally does not try to force employers to provide
benefits. Further, the extent of COBRA violations is
unknown. IRS' method of dealing with potential COBRA
beneficiaries, in GAO'S view, discourages the reporting of
violations. GAO believes that Labor and IRS should do more
to ensure that IRS is made aware of potential COBRA
violations. The knowledge that excise taxes may be assessed
for these violations could deter such violations. Also,
people referred by IRS to Labor could get help quicker if
they were given Labor's phone number along with its address.

JOB TRAINING PARTNERSHIP ACT:  REVIEW OF AUDIT FINDINGS
RELATED TO THE DOWNRIVER COMMUNITY CONFERENCE PROGRAM

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-90-105
Pages:  22

GAO initially looked at four expenditures made by the
Downriver Community Conference--an organization that
provides employment training to residents in the Detroit
area--under the Job Training Partnership Act  (1) $151,824
for contractual services to create a data base to be used to
identify potential program participants, (2) $47,740 for a
sole source contract with a computer consultant, (3)
$100,226 for the purchase of an air-conditioning system, and
(4) a $4,725 payment to a terminated employee. While GAO
concluded that these expenditures represented an allowable
use of funds, concerns were raised that GAO had not fully
developed and considered the evidence of wrongdoing or
misuse of funds in connection with these expenditures.  In a
supplement addressing these concerns, GAO notes that it did
find evidence that some local Downriver rules were violated
and that available evidence provides a basis to question the
wisdom and prudence of some of Downriver's actions. However,
GAO did not find sufficient evidence of fraud or other
improprieties to warrant further inquiry or referral  to the
Department of Justice.

NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD:  ACTION NEEDED TO IMPROVE
CASE-PROCESSING TIME AT HEADQUARTERS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-29
Pages:  72

The National Labor Relations Board generally considers cases
involving either allegations of unfair labor practices or
disagreements about elections on union representation. In
response to concerns about the length of time it has taken
to decide some cases appealed to the headquarters Board from
the regional offices, GAO looked at the Board's system for
deciding cases. This report (1) describes how long the Board
had taken to decide cases, particularly since 1984, and
determines whether  there were any excessive delays; (2)
identifies factors that contributed to such delays; and (3)
determines if additional administrative or legislative
action might be warranted.

LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS:  STRIKES AND THE USE OF STRIKE
REPLACEMENTS IN THE 1970S AND 1980S

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-2
Pages:  24, Jan. 18 (24 pages).

The 1980s experienced about half as many strikes as did the
1970s.  Among strikes reported to the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service in 1985 and 1989, GAO estimates that
employers announced an intention of hiring permanent
replacements about one-third of the time and actually hired
them in 17 percent of the strikes. GAO found  little
difference in the use of permanent strike replacements by
employers  in larger versus small strikes. Many employers
and union  representatives involved in strikes in 1985 and
1989 believe that permanent strike replacements were more
common in the late 1980s than in the late 1970s. However,
GAO estimates that--had it surveyed all employers and union
representatives--about one-third of employers and 13 percent
of union representatives would have said that they had no
basis for providing an opinion on trends in the hiring of
permanent replacements.

OIL RESERVE:  SOME CONCERNS REMAIN ABOUT SPR DRAWDOWN AND
DISTRIBUTION

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-16
Pages:  40

The crisis in the Persian Gulf has renewed interest in the
ability of the Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve to counter disruptions in the supply of oil to the
United States. To provide this protection, DOE must be able
to offset the supplies lost by quickly drawing down reserve
oil from its storage sites and distributing it to
purchasers.  This report (1) reviews DOE'S current and
planned capability for removing oil from reserve sites and
getting it to users via oil distribution networks,(2)
examines the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's compliance with
pipeline safety requirements, and (3) discusses DOE'S
efforts to correct problems that GAO previously reported.
GAO concludes that a major distribution could be hampered
because buyers of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil are
required to use U.S.-flag tankers to ship the oil between
U.S. ports.  DOE and industry officials doubt whether enough
U.S.-flag vessels are available to do the job, and questions
remain about the efficiency of procedures to authorize the
use of foreign vessels.

ENERGY MANAGEMENT:  DOE NEEDS TO BETTER IMPLEMENT CONFLICT-
OF-INTEREST CONTROLS

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-15
Pages:  34

DOE has 22 federally funded research and development centers
that are managed and run by private corporations and
universities under contracts with DOE. In fiscal year 1989,
DOE paid these contractors almost $8 billion these
contractors, in turn, awarded about $3.2 billion to
subcontractors. In response to concerns about subcontractor
conflicts of interest, GAO looked into the situation and
found that while DOE'S written policies and procedures
provide guidance on how to spot and avoid conflicts of
interest among subcontractors, DOE field offices have not
been implementing these internal management controls.
Contrary to DOE regulations the DOE Albuquerque field office
abdicated responsibility and allowed the research centers to
make conflict-of-interest determinations themselves.
Although GAO was unable to determine whether DOE'S policies
and procedures were, in practice, effective, GAO noted two
management control problems. First, Albuquerque has relied
extensively on subcontractor self-certification in making
conflict-of-interest decisions even though certifications
may not always be accurate. Second, Albuquerque's
documentation of conflict-of-interest decisions is limited.
GAO also found that neither Albuquerque nor DOE headquarters
exercised effective oversight to ensure that conflicts of
interest were avoided in the subcontracts awarded by the Los
Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories.

OBLIGATIONS LIMITATION:  RESOLUTION TRUST CORPORATION'S
COMPLIANCE AS OF JUNE 30,1990

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-41
Pages:  20

This quarterly report examines the Resolution Trust
Corporation's compliance with the maximum obligation limit
set forth in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,
and Enforcement Act of 1989. The act provides a formula for
calculating the limit and sets aside $50 billion in
financing to resolve troubled savings and loans placed into
conservatorship or receivership. On the basis of its review
of RTC'S September 28,1990, report and schedule and its
financial records, GAO concludes that none of the categories
for the formula were omitted from RTC'S calculation and that
there is little risk that RTC exceeded the limitation.
However, RTC is facing a funding crisis. Without enough
money to absorb the losses and to buy the assets of failed
institutions, RTC will have to slowdown its resolution
efforts. As a result, failing institutions will continue to
incur operating losses, thereby increasing resolution costs.
GAO believes that only quick action to identify a long-term
solution to RTC's funding needs will ensure the
Corporation's continued ability to respond to the thrift
crisis. GAO also followed up on recommendations it made to
RTC in its first quarter report and found that RTC is, in
all instances, making progress on the recommendations,
although none have been fully implemented yet.

RESOLUTION TRUST CORPORATION:  UNNECESSARY LOAN SERVICING
COSTS DUE TO INADEQUATE CONTRACT OVERSIGHT

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-19
Pages:  8

GAO found that from January to July 1990, the Resolution
Trust Corporation might have avoided as much as $1 million
in loan processing costs resulting from continued operations
at a large loan processing center in Orlando, Florida. These
unnecessary costs arose from inadequate RTC oversight,
insufficient RTC and North Carolina National Bank of Florida
initiatives to plan for a large reduction in the number of
loans processed at the center, insufficient cost information
on center operations, and RTC's failure to take early action
to market the center.  Given the thousands of assets in
RTC's current real estate inventory, GAO believes that the
Florida situation highlights the urgent need for timely and
adequate contractor monitoring efforts.

FINANCIAL AUDIT:  FINANCIAL REPORTING AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
AT THE AIR FORCE SYSTEMS COMMAND

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-22
Pages:  59

This report presents the results of GAO'S review of the Air
Force Systems Command's financial management operations.
Systems Command managers are responsible for billions of
dollars in appropriations and accountable assets. However,
GAO found that the Command's internal controls and financial
reporting are not providing adequate and reliable financial
information for effective management and reporting of these
resources. GAO discusses these problems and recommends
corrective actions.

FINANCIAL AUDIT:  AIR FORCE'S BASE-LEVEL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS
DO NOT PROVIDE RELIABLE INFORMATION

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-26
Pages:  24

This report presents of the results of GAO's review of the
Air Force's base-level financial management operations for
fiscal years 1988 and 1989. Base-level managers are
responsible for million of dollars in appropriations and
accountable assets. However, accounting errors and
inaccurate financial reports pervaded the base-level
accounting systems at the 17 bases where GAO conducted its
tests. For fiscal years 1988 and 1989 combined, GAO
identified over $2.7 billion in adjustments needed to
correct errors in year-end, base-level trial balances. This
inaccurate information had already found its way into
financial reports delivered to the Department of Defense,
the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of the
Treasury, and Congress. Real property account balances were
misstated because transactions were recorded in an
inaccurate and timely manner. Unauthorized and excessive
issues of inventory and equipment diminished accountability
for those items, and the failure to match personnel and
inventory payroll records created an opportunity for
unauthorized payroll transactions.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT:  INS LACKS ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROLS
OVER ITS RESOURCES

Order No.:  GA0/AFMD-91-20
Pages:  34

Over 40 years ago, Congress required each federal agency to
establish and maintain adequate systems of accounting and
internal control. However, GAO found that because of an
outmoded accounting system, poor internal controls, and lack
of management emphasis on financial management--weaknesses
that have gone uncorrected for years--the Immigration and
Naturalization Service continues to lack fiscal
accountability over its resources. INS could lose millions
of dollars in revenue because accurate and reliable
financial information is unavailable to effectively bill,
collect, or litigate amounts owed the government. Further,
INS' primary accounting system contains incomplete and
inaccurate financial data. GAO concludes that solving INS'
financial management problems will take strong management
commitment and leadership that must be sustained across
succeeding administrations.

INSPECTORS GENERAL:  WORK PERFORMED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF
LABOR INSPECTOR GENERAL IN 1988 AND 1989

Order No.:  GAO/AFMD-91-24
Pages:  15

The Office of Inspector General audits and investigates
program agencies at the Department of Labor. It also
investigates allegations of racketeering. During fiscal
years 1988 and 1989, both the Office of Audit and the Office
of Investigations spent a majority of their time and
resources investigating projects at the Employment and
Training Administration and at the Employment Standards
Administration. Most of the investigations done by the
Office of Investigations centered on alleged criminal
activity in Labor programs. The Office of Labor Racketeering
classified more than half of the racketeering cases open
during fiscal years 1988 and 1989 as involving employee
benefit plans. GAO was told that all of the Office's cases
investigated during the past two years involved alleged
racketeering or related criminal activity. The Office
pursued all of its cases under criminal statutes except for
two cases pursued under the civil provisions of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act.

IMMIGRATION MANAGEMENT:  STRONG LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT
REFORMS NEEDED TO ADDRESS SERIOUS PROBLEMS

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-28
Pages:  111

The Immigration and Naturalization Service is faced with
balancing the demanding roles of enforcement and service. On
the one hand, INS enforces laws meant to prevent the illegal
entry of millions of poverty stricken, often repressed
people naturally drawn to a better life in the United
States. On the other hand, INS facilitates legal immigration
by processing millions of requests relating to citizenship
and asylum and by inspecting hundreds of millions of people
at ports of entry. This report, one in a series of general
management reviews of major federal departments and
agencies, concludes that over the past decade weak
management systems and inconsistent leadership at INS have
allowed serious problems to go unresolved. As a result, the
agency has degenerated into a group of segmented autonomous
programs, each trying to handle its own set of problems with
little attention to their interrelatedness. Compounding this
lack of overall direction is a chaotic budget development
process that has produced budgets that are simply
compilations of program submissions with little
accountability for funds or attention to agencywide
priorities. The current INS organizational structure, marked
by complicated lines of authority and communication, adds to
and perpetuates the agency's segmented management. Although
lNS' problems did not happen overnight, the agency needs to
take immediate action to improve both enforcement and
service operations. In the long run, the Department of
Justice and INS must articulate a vision of how INS is to
effectively implement the nation's immigration policy.

POSTAL SERVICE:  CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE--EXPRESS AND
PRIORITY MAIL TRANSPORTATION

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-13
Pages:  4

GAO reviewed the Postal Service's award of an express and
priority mail transportation contract to Air Train, Inc.
(later renamed Emery Worldwide Airline, Inc.) and the
contractor's performance under that contract.  The contract
says that the minimum acceptable performance for meeting
express and priority mail delivery times at destination
cities is 98 percent of the time. GAO found that after the
initial start-up week, the on-time performance requirement
was met for 54 of 57 weeks. In addition to the on-time
requirement, the contractor is expected to deliver all
express and priority mail to destination cities without
leaving any mail behind, either at the originating city or
at the hub (where the mail is sorted). GAO found that Air
Train failed to meet these standards 10 out of 57 weeks.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA:  INFORMATION ON COURT ORDERED TENANT
EVICTIONS

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-29
Pages:  20

This report provides information on court ordered tenant
evictions in the District of Columbia, almost 3,000 of which
took place in fiscal year 1990. GAO discusses (1) the time
that elapsed between the landlord's filing of an eviction
request, the court issuance of the eviction order, and the
actual eviction by U.S. deputy marshals for evictions
carried out in fiscal year 1990; (2) reasons for the elapsed
times; and (3) whether using contractors to carry out the
evictions, instead of deputy marshals, would be legal and
appropriate.

REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT:  INHERENT WEAKNESSES MAY LIMIT
ITS USEFULNESS FOR SMALL GOVERNMENTS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-16
Pages:  23

Have federal agencies been sufficiently analyzing the effect
of their proposed regulations on small governments (towns
with less than 50,000 inhabitants)?  Further, has the goal
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980--to reduce
regulatory burdens on small businesses, small governments,
and nonprofit organizations--been met for small governments?
GAO found that federal agencies are not doing as many
analyses for small governments as they might, largely
because of weaknesses in the act. First, the Small Business
Administration may be unable to monitor compliance with the
act because it lacks expertise in small government issues.
Second, that act has no provisions for ensuring federal
agency compliance. Third, neither the act nor SBA has
provided criteria or definitions for determining whether
federal rule-making agencies are conducting sufficient
analyses of regulations affecting small governments and how
these analyses should be done. GAO is concerned that
proposed legislation--S. 1758, the Small Governments
Regulatory Partnership Act--would not address these
weaknesses. GAO believes that SBA should develop the
expertise needed to better implement provisions relating to
small governments.  GAO also believes that Congress may wish
to consider amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act to
require SBA, in consultation with OMB, to develop criteria
on whether and how federal agencies should conduct analyses
for small governments.  It should also consider expanding
SBA'S existing authority to review and comment on proposed
agency regulations affecting small governments. This
expansion should direct SBA to work with OMB to ensure
agency compliance with the provisions of the act.

MAJOR ISSUES FACING THE 102ND CONGRESS

Order No.:  GAO/T-OCG-91-1
Pages:  19

GAO'S 1988 transition series sought to alert the President-
elect and the new Congress to the many challenges facing the
nation. This testimony updates the status of the issues GAO
cited in 1988.  The Comptroller General first reviews the
overall state of the economy and the budget, cautioning that
a protracted war in the Middle East, the recession at home,
and further increases in the cost of deposit insurance could
trigger another explosive rise in the deficit over the next
several years; the general fund deficit--excluding the
surpluses in the Social Security and other trust funds--
already appears likely to top $400 billion in 1991.  He then
discusses critical policy problems in the following program
areas:  defense, the financial sector, health,
transportation, agriculture, energy, the environment,
financial management, and the public service. In some cases
GAO reports significant progress, but that is the exception.
Many of the problems, including some of the most important
ones like the thrift crisis, have become more severe. Given
the rapid developments in international affairs--as
evidenced by changes in the Warsaw Pact countries and by the
economic and political integration of Western Europe--the
Comptroller General believes that it is time to revisit the
question, What is required of our government?  If the United
States is to succeed in this new world order, the
Comptroller General believes that several prerequisites must
be satisfied.  First, we must have a government that works,
one that operates efficiently and effectively, both in its
internal functions and in its delivery of services to the
American people.  To reach that goal, investment in
government, its people, its facilities, and its technology
is needed.  Second, we must have a government whose
financial performance relates properly to the national and
world economy.  For that to be achieved, the United States
must move toward a long term fiscal policy that recognizes
the need for a much higher level of national savings.
Third, we must have a financial system in whose safety and
soundness the American people can have complete confidence,
so that our market economy can effectively allocate capital
to the most productive uses.  To accomplish that, we must
resolve the thrift crisis, restore the soundness of the
banking industry, and ensure an efficient and effectively
regulated structure of capital markets.

MEDICAID:  LEGISLATION NEEDED TO IMPROVE COLLECTIONS FROM
PRIVATE INSURERS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-25
Pages:  32

As a public assistance program, Medicaid was expected to pay
for health care only after Medicaid recipients had used all
their other health care resources.  GAO found that two major
problems hinder states from collecting from private insurers
for recipients' covered health care costs.  First, states
cannot prohibit some out-of-state insurers from trying to
avoid paying state Medicaid agencies for such costs.  States
now lack jurisdiction over insurers that operate only
incidentally in the state.  Second, states' limited
authority over plans covered under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) does not allow them to
prohibit these plans from trying to avoid payments for
recipients' covered costs.  Further, many states have not
exercised the authority they do have to mandate that no
ERISA plan include any contract provision that might limit
or exclude payments for Medicaid recipients' health care
costs.  While  state officials found it hard to pinpoint
losses resulting from their payment systems, examples of
state Medicaid losses obtained by GAO suggest that the
problem may be substantial--perhaps millions of dollars in
losses each year--and growing.  To minimize future losses,
federal legislation is needed to clarify Medicaid's role as
a payer of last resort and to enhance the ability of states
to collect from out-of-state insurers and ERISA plans.

MEDICAL MALPRACTICE:  FEW CLAIMS RESOLVED THROUGH MICHIGAN'S
VOLUNTARY ARBITRATION PROGRAM

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-38
Pages:  31

The current ways of resolving medical malpractice claims in
this country are neither efficient nor equitable.  Claims
take a long time to be resolved, awards and settlements are
unpredictable, and legal costs are steep.  Concern about the
existing system has inspired alternative proposals for
claims resolution, including fault-based and no-fault based
approaches.  This report looks at one of the fault-based
alternatives-the Michigan Medical Malpractice Arbitration
Program. GAO assessed (1) the extent of hospital, health
care provider, and patient participation under the Michigan
plan; (2) the arbitration alternative's effect on medical
malpractice claims resolution; and (3) whether arbitration
contributed to reducing medical malpractice insurance costs.
GAO'S conclusions about the program are limited because
program participation has been low. GAO does not foresee
significant increases in program participation because of
the voluntary nature of the program and because of the lack
of incentives for patient participation.

MEDICARE:  MILLIONS IN POTENTIAL RECOVERIES NOT BEING SOUGHT
BY MARYLAND CONTRACTOR

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-32
Pages:  9

As part of a broader GAO effort to evaluate the adequacy of
the Medicare contractor budget for claims-processing and
program safeguard activities, GAO discovered a situation
that it believes warrants congressional attention. GAO found
that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland--a Medicare
claims-processing contractor--has paid at least $8.8 million
in claims for which it has identified other health insurers
that may have primary payment responsibility under the
Medicare secondary payer provisions.  In this case, the
contractor--through its investigative efforts--has
identified other parties that may owe Medicare sizable sums.
However, the contractor lacks the resources to recover these
amounts. GAO concludes that any additional funding of the
contractor's activities to recover these payments may yield
considerably more than each dollar so expended.

SOCIAL SECURITY:  ANALYSIS OF A PROPOSAL TO PRIVATIZE TRUST
FUND RESERVES

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-22
Pages:  40

This report analyzes a proposal by a Member of Congress to
create a new system of individual Social Security accounts.
Under this proposal, the accumulating reserves of the Social
Security Trust Fund would be returned to workers and
invested in individual accounts in the private sector, where
they would be held until the workers' retirement.  In
effect, the proposal would partially and temporarily
privatize Social Security.  GAO found that the proposal
could be integrated with the existing progressive benefit
structure and, given favorable financial market conditions,
could improve retirement incomes.  If implemented, the
Individual Social Security Account may change the mix of
public and private saving but not necessarily the magnitude
of national saving.  The proposal also raises many
administrative difficulties and policy issues that need to
be addressed before Individual Social Security Accounts
could be considered a fully working alternative to the use
of trust fund reserves.

SOCIAL SECURITY:  PRODUCTION INITIATIVES IN OHA'S REGION V
COMPLY WITH LAW AND GUIDELINES

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-36BR
Pages:  24

Persons denied Medicare and Social Security benefits may
appeal such decisions to Administrative Law Judges in 132
hearing offices around the country. The Social Security
Administration's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) is
responsible for managing these judges.  GAO reviewed
productivity initiatives underway in OHA'S Chicago Regional
Office and found that they complied with Administrative
Procedure Act and OHA guidelines.  GAO also found that by
including dispositions of regional chiefs and retired judges
in hearing office statistics, average production figures for
the Chicago region and some hearing offices were slightly
overstated.  However, in terms of distribution of monetary
awards, the only apparent gain from the overstatement was
that one hearing office received an additional $3,529 for
awards and bonuses to support staff for which it would not
have been otherwise eligible. As OHA studies and redesigns
its system of productivity measures for its Administrative
Law Judges, it should ensure that whatever measurement
system it designs fairly recognizes the work done by
individuals and by offices.  In the interim, GAO believes
that when calculating the productivity of its hearing
offices, OHA should count regional chiefs and any retired
judges as resources for those hearing offices that received
credit for their dispositions.

The Department of Defense relies on both in-house and
outside technical expertise to design and develop highly
complex command, control, communications, and intelligence
systems.  This report examines the extent to which DOD uses
engineering support contracts for advice and direction in
acquiring automated data processing systems.  DOD data show
that from fiscal years 1985 through 1989 show that DOD spent
about $3.4 billion for engineering and technical support of
system acquisitions.  Air Force was by far the largest user,
accounting for over $2 billion of the $3.4 billion spent.
DOD'S annual expenditures went from $494.5 million in fiscal
year 1985 to $891.7 million in fiscal year 1989, an 80-
percent increase.

MAINFRAME PROCUREMENTS:  STATISTICS SHOWING HOW AND WHAT THE
GOVERNMENT IS ACQUIRING

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-13
Pages:  32

GAO has previously issued a series of 10 reports on
compatible computer procurements.  Those reports looked at
those agencies that obligated $50 million or more for
mainframe computers and mainframe peripheral acquisitions.
This capping report provides consolidated statistics on
mainframe computer and mainframe peripheral procurements by
35 federal agencies. In particular, GAO looked at the extent
to which the 35 agencies required compatibility with IBM or
other equipment manufacturer. GAO found that during the 3-
1/2 fiscal years ending in March 1989, the agencies
obligated $1.9 billion for mainframe and mainframe
peripheral procurements.  Eighty-two percent ($1,587.8
million) of all the procurements required compatibility with
existing systems. IBM-compatible procurements comprised 64
percent of the compatibility-limited procurements and 52
percent of all procurements. With a 47 percent share of the
total federal market, IBM was the largest vendor; Unisys,
with a 20-percent share, was the next largest. Almost 60
percent of the total value of all procurements involved only
one vendor.  When GAO used the number of procurements--
rather than dollars--for comparison, it found that the
agencies had 3,225 procurements for mainframe and mainframe
peripherals and over 90 percent required some kind of
compatibility. The agencies required IBM compatibility 60
percent of the time. When IBM compatibility was required,
IBM equipment was supplied 68 percent of the time.

INTERNATIONAL BANKING:  IMPLEMENTATION OF RISK-BASED CAPITAL
ADEQUACY STANDARDS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-80
Pages:  41

Concerned that banks may not be holding enough capital to
ensure their safety and soundness, Congress passed
legislation in 1983 encouraging other countries to maintain
or improve banks' capital bases.  In 1988 the Basle
Committee on Banking supervision, which included
representatives from 12 nations, adopted a framework to
measure capital adequacy and to establish minimum capital
standards for banks operating internationally.  Included in
the framework are minimum capital adequacy standards that
are to be fully achieved by the end of 1992.  This report
looks at (1) steps regulators and financial institutions are
taking to implement the framework, (2) progress made toward
meeting the framework's objectives, and (3) issues that
remain unresolved in implementing the framework.  GAO
reviews implementation in the United States, France,
Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Japan.

also spread overseas and has led to losses in U.S.
agricultural exports.  This report discusses (1) U.S.
government efforts to prevent or resolve trade disputes
arising over pesticide use; (2) specific procedures used by
foreign governments in selected Pacific Rim countries and
Australia to set tolerances and test for pesticides on U.S.
produce exports; and (3) the technical capabilities of these
foreign governments to conduct pesticide testing.  To
evaluate testing and technical capabilities, GAO visited
Australia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. GAO
found that the five countries lack information about which
pesticides and other chemicals are being used on U.S.
produce. Further, while the five countries have the
necessary testing capabilities, they use a variety of
standards in testing for pesticides

CAMBODIA:  MULTILATERAL RELIEF EFFORTS IN BORDER CAMPS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-99FS
Pages:  9

Waves of Cambodians first fled the Khmer Rouge regime and
later the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. As a result, an
estimated 350,000 refugees and displaced persons now live in
Thai border camps. This fact sheet discusses (1) the events
leading up to the current situation in the camps, (2) the
amount of money being spent to support the camps, (3) how
the money is being put to use, and (4) the control and

U.S. EMBASSY, MOSCOW  ALTERNATIVES FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
THEIR COSTS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-43FS
Pages:  3

Using Soviet construction workers, the United States began
building a new embassy in Moscow in 1979. By the mid-1980s,
it was discovered that the building was riddled with Soviet
eavesdropping devices, and construction was halted. This
unclassified version of a classified report looks at the
State Department's proposal to demolish the unfinished
embassy and to rebuild atop the old foundation. GAO
discusses (1) the basis for the current cost estimate of
$270 million for demolition and reconstruction and (2) the
alternatives considered by the State Department for a new
embassy in Moscow and their costs. GAO is concerned that the
State Department's estimates for demolition and rebuilding
may be too low. Regardless of which option is eventually
funded, GAO notes that construction agreements with the
Soviets are still pending for the new office building and
for other land and buildings in adjacent sites. Further
delays in concluding these agreements could affect
construction costs and schedules.  In addition, State has
not prepared cost estimates on the additional property and
facility needs for the Moscow complex.

DRUG INTERDICTION:  FUNDING CONTINUES TO INCREASE BUT
PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS IS UNKNOWN

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-10
Pages:  23

Drug interdiction programs established by the Coast Guard,
Customs Service, and Border Patrol, with support provided by
the Department of Defense, are designed to stop smugglers
and/or their shipments by focusing on the mode of
transportation. These efforts are thus referred to as land,
marine, air, and commercial cargo interdiction programs. GAO
examines (1) the available measures of drug interdiction
program performance and whether performance can be compared
between different programs, (2) funding for the interdiction
programs, (3) quantities of drugs seized through the
interdiction programs, and (4) the relationship between drug
seizures and the use of advance information (prior
intelligence) on the drug shipments.

ACQUISITION REFORM:  DEFENSE MANAGEMENT REPORT SAVINGS
INITIATIVES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-11
Pages:  18

The 1986 Packard Commission made many recommendations for
improving operations at the Department of Defense. In
response, DOD developed the Defense Management Report, which
outlines steps to improve DOD management. GAO found that DOD
has implemented several Defense Management Report savings
initiatives and has begun to realize some savings, but the
larger, more complex initiatives are still in the planning
stages. To fully implement the initiatives and achieve DOD'S
savings goal, GAO believes that continued management support
is necessary. Although the initiatives were estimated to
save about $39 billion over fiscal years 1991-95, these
estimates did not always rely on cost analyses supported by
historical facts or empirical cost data. GAO'S review of
$24.5 billion in estimated savings showed that about 82
percent of these savings were based primarily on management
judgment, suggesting that the reliability of the estimates
may vary.  DOD officials said that current budget
negotiations and international security developments--
including Operation Desert Shield--will not delay the
implementation of the efficiencies to generate these
savings.  As of June 1990, none of the Packard Commission's
recommendations to streamline and reduce the acquisition
work force had been made; in fact, the number of acquisition
personnel increased slightly. DOD estimates that over fiscal
years 1991-95, Defense Management Report initiatives will
eliminate almost 2,400 civilian and almost 2,000 military
positions from the acquisition work force. The fiscal year
1991 National Defense Authorization Act, however, requires
much deeper cuts in acquisition and headquarters personnel.

DEFENSE MANAGEMENT:  EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE ACQUISITION
MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-15
Pages:  16

GAO reviewed the military services' efforts to streamline
their acquisition management structure in accordance with
DOD'S 1989 Defense Management Report, which was issued in
response to the Packard Commission's 1986 recommendations.
The Packard Commission concluded that DOD acquisition
management had become so encumbered and unproductive that
weapons systems frequently cost more than planned and took
too long to develop and deliver. GAO found that--as
prescribed in the Defense Management Report--each military
service has revised (1) its three-tier structure and (2) the
roles of its materiel and systems command. GAO believes that
these revisions, if fully implemented as intended will more
clearly separate the streamlined acquisition structure from
the service's existing structure by (1) appointing Service
Acquisition Executives and Program Executive Officers who
are devoted full-time to acquisition matters, (2) giving
three-tier officials more control over acquisition matters,
and (3) removing unnecessary review layers from the
acquisition process. Until DOD issues guidance on
implementing the Defense Management Report changes and the
services update their policies and procedures, GAO cannot
determine whether or not DOD'S management accountability
goal will be fully achieved.

ARMY ACQUISITION:  AIR DEFENSE ANTITANK SYSTEM DID NOT MEET
OPERATIONAL TEST OBJECTIVES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-51
Pages:  19

The Army selected its current line-of-sight forward heavy
air defense system--known as the "Air Defense Antitank
System"--in November 1987 to provide needed air defense to
the maneuver force. However, GAO found that operational
testing did not demonstrate that the system was
operationally suitable. The system fell far short of its
availability requirements, in large part because many system
components were unreliable, and many effectiveness
requirements were not met. While the Army acknowledges the
system's problems, it believes that the system has
demonstrated sufficient operational effectiveness to warrant
continuation of the program. In August 1990, the Army opted
to defer production of the system for two years in hopes of
resolving the system's problems. Because the system has not
proven that it can meet established requirements, by law the
Army cannot obligate any procurement funding after fiscal
year 1989 until the system meets or exceeds the Army's
operational test performance criteria.

MILITARY EXPORTS:  IMPLEMENTATION OF RECENT OFFSET
LEGISLATION

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-13
Pages:  8

Offsets are a range of industrial and commercial
compensation practices required by foreign governments and
firms as conditions for the purchase of military exports.
There is a growing perception that offset arrangements erode
the U.S. industrial base as technology and component
production is transferred to foreign sources to satisfy
offset commitments. This report looks at steps taken by the
executive branch to (1) establish a comprehensive U.S.
policy on offsets addressing technology transfer, U.S.
financing of offset arrangements, and the effects of offsets
on specific subsectors of the U.S. industrial base; (2)
negotiate with foreign governments to limit the adverse
effects of offsets; and (3) require U.S. industry to notify
DOD of offset arrangements exceeding $50 million.

WEAPONS PRODUCTION:  IMPACTS OF PRODUCTION RATE CHANGES ON
AIRCRAFT UNIT COSTS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-12
Pages:  12

GAO reviewed the sensitivity of estimated procurement costs
of selected military aircraft programs to reductions in
numbers of aircraft purchased each year. Aircraft
procurement unit costs generally increase as their
procurement rates decrease. However, some mature Air Force
and Navy procurement programs, including those for the KC-
135R engine modification, F/A-18, F-16, AV-B, and F-15 would
not show as significant a unit cost increase as other
aircraft programs if their procurement rates were cut.
According to contractors, the procurement unit cost of some
mature aircraft is less sensitive to procurement rate
reductions when at least one of the following factors is
present  (1) contractors have a chance to manage overhead
and other costs in anticipation of production rate changes,
(2) foreign customers' requirements can offset reductions in
the U.S. procurement quantities, and (3) multiyear
procurement can be used to stabilize prices over a longer
production period. Contractors also said that unit cost is
especially sensitive to sudden unanticipated changes in
production rates. In GAO'S view, these circumstances
underscore the importance of program stability. When
procurement rate decreases are necessary, contractors should
be given enough advance notice so they can eliminate
unnecessary facility, overhead, and other costs before the
production rate decreases begin.

TEST AND EVALUATION:  THE DIRECTOR, OPERATIONAL TEST AND
EVALUATION'S CONTROLS OVER CONTRACTORS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-60
Pages:  17

The Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, uses
contractors to assist with the operational test and
evaluation of major weapon systems. Concerns have arisen
that some of these contractors may have a conflict of
interest; that is, they could be assessing the operational
testing of the very weapon systems that they had helped to
develop. This report (l) describes the nature and extent of
the Director's management controls over contractor support,
including measures to address possible conflicts of interest
under omnibus contracts; (2) provides GAO'S views on the
Director's use of Federally Funded Research and Development
Centers, particularly the Institute for Defense Analyses;
and (3) determines the Director's use of the Institute
during fiscal years 1987 through 1989 and identifies any
possible conflicts of interest and the Institute's controls
to avoid such conflicts.  While the Director's policies and
procedures for managing contractors comply with existing
guidelines, GAO is concerned that the Institute is not now
required to disclose to the Director possible conflicts of
interest arising either from its work for no organizations
responsible for system acquisitions and development and
testing or from its use of consultants.

DOD PROCUREMENT:  CHANGES TO MILITARY SPECIFICATIONS FOR
TESTING INDUSTRIAL FASTENERS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-84
Pages:  8

Concluding that several military aircraft accidents were
caused by poor quality fasteners, the Air Force made the
testing specifications for class 3 threaded fasteners more
stringent. GAO found that the Air Force followed applicable
DOD guidance in making the change. To implement the more
stringent testing specifications, the Air Force and the Navy
procured a specific gage--called an indicating gage--that
analyzes deviations in fastener threads. When procuring
these gages, the Air Force and the Navy followed competitive
procurement practices specified in DOD regulations and the
Competition in Contracting Act.

BIOLOGICAL WARFARE:  BETTER CONTROLS IN DOD'S RESEARCH COULD
PREVENT UNNEEDED EXPENDITURES

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-68
Pages:  20

The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972, which
prohibits development, production, and stockpiling of
biological and toxin weapons, counts over 100 nations among
its signatories. Yet the number of countries having or
suspected of having biological programs has more than
doubled since then. Starting in fiscal year 1984, Congress
began appropriating funds--$370 million so far--for the
development of countermeasures to defend against a
biological weapons attack. However, GAO found that the Army,
lacking adequate internal controls in its medical research
program, unnecessarily spent funds on research and
development efforts that did not address validated threats
and may have duplicated the research efforts of other
federal agencies.

MILITARY BASES:  RELOCATING THE NAVAL AIR STATION AGANA'S
OPERATIONS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-83
Pages:  58

To accommodate a growing tourist industry and to promote
economic development, Guam wants to expand its international
airport onto property occupied by the U.S. Naval Air Station
Agana. The government of Guam has asked the United States
many times to transfer the station facilities and land to
its control. This report looks at (1) the feasibility of
relocating Agana operations to Andersen Air Force Base,
Guam; (2) the estimated costs of such a relocation; (3) the
potential costs of making enough Navy land available at the
Air Station to expand the international airport and related
facilities without relocating all of the Navy's operations.
GAO concludes that while it is possible to consolidate Navy
and Air Force operations at Andersen Air Force Base, it
would take over 100 years to recover the costs of relocating
the Navy's operations. Although not endorsing any approach,
GAO outlines four options that would allow the airport to
expand without requiring the Navy to relocate. Navy and Guam
officials, however, have expressed concerns about each of
these options and have said that none would fully satisfy
their needs.

MILITARY BASES:  PROCESS USED BY SERVICES FOR JANUARY 1990
BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT PURPOSES

The fiscal year 1991 National Defense Authorization Act
established a new, independent commission to evaluate DOD'S
base closure and realignment proposals, and DOD must
reevaluate its January 1990 candidate bases against criteria
yet to be established. This report provides information on
DOD'S processes before passage of the act. GAO discusses (1)
how DOD had selected the domestic military bases announced
as candidates for disclosure and realignment by the
Secretary of Defense in January 1990 and (2) whether the
military services had developed realistic cost estimates for
closing and realigning the forces at those bases.  GAO found
that DOD did not provide specific written guidance to the
services on how to choose bases for closure and realignment.
Instead, the Secretary of Defense spoke to the services in
general terms, instructing them to consider anticipated
force structure and budget reductions in selecting candidate
bases. In selecting candidate bases, none of the services
used a process as comprehensive and well documented as the
one followed by the 1988 Commission on Base Realignment and
closure.  Further, the processes used by the services in
selecting bases for closure varied.  The Navy did not
develop cost and savings estimates prior to the Secretary's
January 1990 announcement, and the Army and Air Force cost
and savings estimates were only preliminary; efforts to
refine these estimates were suspended with passage of the
fiscal year 1991 Defense Authorization Act.

ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE:  TACTICAL SURVEILLANCE SONOBUOY AND
RELATED SOFTWARE NEED TO BE TESTED TOGETHER

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-41
Pages:  13

Sonobuoys, which are dropped into the ocean from
antisubmarine aircraft, can pick up noises from enemy
submarines and transmit this information by radio to the
plane; this data can then be used to identify, locate, and
attack the submarines. GAO found that the Navy's revised
acquisition strategy adds risk to the Tactical Surveillance
Sonobuoy Program because the sonobuoys may need to be
modified if deficiencies are revealed during operational
testing in fiscal year 1993. Also, if the development of the
aircraft software is further delayed, the Navy will be
unable to use the sonobuoys for some time after they are
delivered. Finally, the revised strategy contradicts Navy
guidance, which generally requires operational test and
evaluation of an entire system before production is
authorized. The Tactical Surveillance Sonobuoy Program is
not an exception to this rule. Consequently, GAO recommends
that the Navy not authorize further production of the
sonobuoy until testing proves that it will work when it is
integrated with the new aircraft software.

OVER-THE-HORIZON RADAR:  BETTER JUSTIFICATION NEEDED FOR DOD
SYSTEMS' EXPANSION

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-61
Pages:  25

The Air Force's Over-the-Horizon Backscatter radar, which
can detect and track bomber-size aircraft, was originally
developed to provide the North American Aerospace Defense
Command's continental air defenses with early warnings of an
attack. The Navy's Relocatable Over-the-Horizon Radar was
designed to provide air surveillance and warnings of bomber
attacks on Navy battle groups and other U.S. and allied
tactical forces.  This report (1) examines DOD's plans to
use the Air Force radar for counterdrug purposes and (2)
provides information on the cost, design, acquisition and
deployment, missions, and inoperability of both the Air
Force and Navy radar programs.  GAO concludes that DOD needs
to clarify the primary purposes of the central radar system.
If the main purpose is for air defense, rather than the
counterdrug mission, future budget requests should be
justified on that basis, describing what threat the system
is expected to detect. Before providing funds for any
additional Over-the-Horizon Backscatter radar sectors,
Congress may wish to have in hand satisfactory operational
test results on the east coast radar system.

potential reductions and rescissions for congressional
consideration. If the proposed procurement of certain
aircraft is reduced or deferred, $658.8 million would be
available from the fiscal year 1991 budget request. An

NAVY BUDGET:  STATUS OF FLYING HOUR AND STEAMING DAY
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-62
Pages:  5

In 1988 Congress asked that the Navy provide budget
justifications for its aircraft flying hour and ship
steaming day programs. These justifications were to include
measurable mission-related goals and the resources need to
meet them, a method for measuring the degree to which the
goals have been met, and an explanation of any differences
between the goals and the actual results. GAO found that the
Navy added three performance indicators in its fiscal year
1990 steaming day budget justifications. The Navy has not
yet developed performance indicators for its flying hour
budget justifications but expects that indicators will be
incorporated into the fiscal year 1992 budget
justifications.  In addition, the Navy has made an effort to
quantify the relationship of flying hours and steaming days
to proficiency and mission readiness. However, because
factors other than the number and frequency of flying hours
and steaming days--such as personnel, equipment, materiel,
and maintenance--affect proficiency and mission readiness,
quantifying the relationship between budget requests and
accomplishment of program goals is difficult. The increased
operational requirements of Operation Desert Shield will
further complicate the process. Thus, the Navy cannot relate
actual versus planned program performance in terms of
program expenditures.

GAO reviewed DOD'S Humanitarian Assistance Program and its
effect on the utilization and donation programs run by the
General Services Administration. Under the Humanitarian
Assistance Program, DOD can make available for humanitarian
relief any nonlethal excess supplies in its system. In the
mid 1980s, the program was used to donate excess property to
help refugee and resistance groups in Afghanistan and to fly
wounded Afghans to the United States and Europe for medical
treatment. Since then, DOD has transferred excess property
to an increasing number of other countries.  This fact sheet
provides information on (1) the quantity and category of
excess material and equipment donated through the program on
an annual basis; (2) the value of these items, based on the
acquisition cost or other valuation; (3) a list of countries
and organizations within those countries that have received
excess property; (4) the annual costs for transporting
excess property; and (5) an assessment of how well excess
property has been used.

Direct costs for enlisted personnel, who comprise over 85
percent of the total U.S. active-duty military force,
account for one-sixth of the annual defense budget. The high
cost of maintaining a balanced and ready enlisted force
underscores the need for efficient and effective management
of these resources, particularly as the services move toward
smaller forces. This report examines how the services (1)
manage the size and composition of their enlisted forces,
(2) are planning for enlisted force reductions, and (3)
comply with DOD requirements for enlisted force management.
Because the Navy and the Marine Corps do not keep records on
key enlisted force management data submitted to DOD, GAO
only reviewed the Air Force and the Army.

In the April 1989 explosion aboard the U.S.S. Iowa, 47
sailors died when bags of gun powder ignited in one of the
battleship's gun turrets. GAO asked the Department of
Energy's Sandia National Laboratories to review the Navy's
technical analysis of the incident; the Navy had concluded
that the explosion was caused by a deliberate act and not by
a defect in the gun or propellent.  While Sandia could
neither confirm nor deny the Navy's conclusion, it did
identify a plausible alternative explanation--that due to
its impact sensitivity, the gun powder could have exploded
as it was being rammed against the base of a shell. As a
result of Sandia's findings, the Navy halted all firings of
the 16-inch guns. With Sandia's help, it is doing more
testing. On the basis of that testing, and because of the
battleships' role in Operation Desert Shield, the Navy has
lifted the firing suspension for the U.S.S. Missouri and the
U.S.S. Wisconsin.  GAO found no evidence of any systemic
safety or serviceability problems aboard the battleships.
GAO did discover problems with the adequacy of supervisory
personnel levels, including the personnel for operating the
turrets, and with training for 16-inch gun operations.   GAO
recommends that, unless current Middle East operations
convincingly demonstrate the utility of the battleships to
support an amphibious assault, the Navy decommission the
Missouri and the Wisconsin.

DEFENSE PROCUREMENT:  NOT PROVIDING TECHNICAL DATA MAY LIMIT
DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY COMPETITION

Order No.:  GAO/NSIAD-91-53
Pages:  9

Full and open competition involves allowing all sources
capable of meeting the government's needs to compete. Of the
1,047 contracts valued at over $25,000 awarded by the
Defense General Supply Center in Richmond, Virginia, during
the third quarter of fiscal year 1988, less than two percent
were classified as based on other than full and open
competition; the rest were considered fully competitive.
However, GAO found that almost half of these contracts were
actually based on solicitations giving only part numbers as
item descriptions. In general, GAO believes that these
purchase descriptions were inconsistent with full and open
competition. Although the Defense Logistics Agency has
recently stopped classifying and processing solicitations as
fully competitive on the basis of part numbers, other
problems remain that may be causing opportunities for
competition to be missed. This report discusses actions
needed to ensure that Defense Logistics Agency supply
centers award future contracts on the basis of full and open
competition.

COST AND FINANCING OF OPERATION DESERT SHIELD

Order No.:  GAO/T-NSIAD-91-3
Pages:  15

The Comptroller General testified that the total U.S. cost
of Operation Desert Shield could exceed $130 billion in
fiscal year 1991. This estimate consists of three components
the baseline cost of the U.S. forces committed to Desert
Shield ($100 billion); the incremental cost of mounting the
operation, including troop deployment, calling up the
reserves, and providing required additional support for the
forces ($30 billion); and related costs like debt
forgiveness for Egypt and humanitarian assistance ($7
billion). The first component involves funds that would be
spent whether the troops were in the Middle East or
elsewhere.  To date, 35 countries have furnished troops and
equipment.  Yet contributions to defray U.S. expenses are
small relative to the total U.S. cost of the operation; DOD
has reported receipt of cash contributions of about $4.3
billion and in-kind contributions of about $379 million. As
a result of Operation Desert Shield, DOD is obligating its
fiscal year 1991 appropriations at a rapid pace and will
exhaust some of these funds by spring. A supplemental
appropriation to cover the costs of Operation Desert Shield
seems inevitable, the Comptroller General testified. Because
of many uncertainties in the cost estimates, however, GAO
believes that it would be inappropriate to provide a lump
sum supplemental now. Instead, Congress should provide
periodic appropriations during the fiscal year, as actual
costs become clearer. Some of the uncertainties are (1) the
unknown value of offsets like assistance in kind, including
fuel and water; (2) inadequate DOD guidance on what
constitutes Desert Shield costs (an important factor in any
emergency appropriations under the Budget Enforcement Act);
and (3) other factors like a decision to implement a
rotation policy.

RANGELAND MANAGEMENT:  BLM EFFORTS TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED
LIVESTOCK GRAZING NEED STRENGTHENING

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-17
Pages:  16

Unauthorized livestock grazing on public rangelands--known
as grazing trespass--can take several forms, including
grazing more livestock than allowed by permit, grazing in
areas that are closed to livestock, or grazing during
unauthorized times of the year. An effective trespass
program must reasonably ensure that offenders, especially
willful ones, (1) will be detected and (2) when detected,
will be assessed a penalty that will not only penalize them
but serve as a deterrent to others. However, GAO found that
the Bureau of Land Management's trespass enforcement efforts
do not meet either of these requirements. Because many
grazing areas are inspected infrequently or not at all,
offenders are unlikely to be detected. Even when offenders
are detected, BLM often exacts no penalties and--for the
more serious violations--seldom assesses the minimum
penalties its own regulations require. BLM staff attribute
the shortfalls in trespass detection and deterrence
primarily to insufficient staff levels. While more staff
would undoubtedly improve performance, GAO believes that
more effective and aggressive detection and deterrence are
possible with existing staffing levels.

OREGON DUNES RECREATION AREA:  PATENTING OF MINING CLAIMS
COMPLIES WITH LAW

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-8
Pages:  39

Under the Mining Law of 1872, U.S. citizens and businesses
are allowed to locate mining claims on most federal lands
and then to obtain full title to them. In 1959 mining claims
were filed for silica sand along the Oregon coast--a site
which in 1972 became the Oregon National Dunes Recreation
Area. In October 1989, at the request of the claim holder,
the federal government transferred title through the patent
process to 780 acres of mining claims in this scenic area.
GAO found that the federal government acted properly when it
concluded that the claims contained an uncommon variety of
sand and, therefore, the claims were subject to the patent
provision of the Mining Law of 1872. In addition, the claim
holder and the federal government complied with the legal
and administrative requirements for patenting. GAO notes,
however, that this situation does raise questions about the
consistency of the mining law's patent provision with more
recent national natural resource policies that call for the
federal government to maintain ownership of federal lands
and to obtain fair market value for public resources.

PARKS AND RECREATION:  RESOURCE LIMITATIONS AFFECT CONDITION
OF FOREST SERVICE RECREATION SITES

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-48
Pages:  64

The Forest Service runs the largest inventory of outdoor
recreation sites in the country.  About 13,000 of these
sites are developed, featuring campgrounds, picnic areas,
and boating and interpretive sites.  GAO estimates that the
Forest Service had a $449 million backlog of unmet
maintenance and reconstruction needs at these sites, more
than double the amount the agency reported in 1986. GAO
developed its own estimate of the backlog because the Forest
Service lacks a reliable system for monitoring or reporting
on the nationwide condition and maintenance needs of its
developed recreation sites. Forest Service officials
attributed the backlog to a lack of personnel and funds. GAO
found that little of the agency's overall recreation budget
is devoted to making the needed repair, and factors like
aging facilities and increased usage are compounding the
problem. GAO is concerned that deferred maintenance could
ultimately result in the loss of many sites. Resource
limitations were only one of several factors affecting
changes in the size and type and to a lesser extent the
number and length of season of developed recreation sites.
However, resource limitations have reduced and eliminated
services like garbage collection and site cleaning. The
Forest Service is now relying on volunteer and a
public/private cost-share program to help compensate for
limited resources. GAO believes that this strategy--while
helpful--faces constraints that will limit its effectiveness
in reducing the backlog.

REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT:  FEDERAL SUPPORT TO THE STATES HAS
DECLINED

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-51
Pages:  40

The Refugee Act of 1980 authorized federal assistance to
resettle refugees in the United States on a uniform basis,
regardless of their country of origin. Upwards of 900,000
refugees have entered this country over the past decade.
Although funds have been appropriated since the expiration
of the act in 1988, the amounts involved have declined,
shifting refugee resettlement costs to state and local
governments. As a result of this and diminished funds to
states for job training and other services, Department of
Health and Human Services assistance per refugee fell 48
percent in 1989 constant dollars--from $6,921 to $3,600.
This report provides (1) estimates of the costs transferred
from the federal government to states as a result of recent
cuts in federal refugee assistance, (2) information from and
views of public and private sector officials on whether
recent reductions have resulted in service cutbacks to
refugees, and (3) data on changes in the percentage of
refugees receiving cash assistance and changes in other
indicators of refugee self-sufficiency.

LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE:  STATES CUSHIONED FUNDING
CUTS BUT ALSO SCALED BACK PROGRAM BENEFITS

Order No.:  GAO/HRD-91-13
Pages:  52

The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program provides
eligible households with assistance for home energy costs.
Assistance is available to (1) help families with cooling
costs, (2) prevent energy cutoffs in crisis situations, and
(3) help families make their homes more energy efficient.
GAO found that between fiscal years 1986 and 1989, the
states--while offsetting about one-fourth of the cuts in
federal funding for the program, mainly with oil overcharge
funds resulting from legal settlements with major oil
producers--scaled back energy assistance benefits In
addition, most states served fewer households, although 43
percent attributed the decrease to factors other than
federal funding cuts, such as improved economic conditions
that reduced the need for assistance. States generally
complied with key program requirements by assuring the
Department of Health and Human Services that they were (1)
doing outreach activities, especially for the elderly and
handicapped, and (2) targeting benefits to households most
in need. Also, the four states GAO visited had incorporated
fiscal controls to prevent erroneous payments. GAO found
that in nearly all states, other government and private
sector programs provide home energy assistance to low-income
households In fiscal year 1989, this assistance amounted to
about $200 million.

TAX ADMINISTRATION:  EFFECTIVENESS OF IRS' RETURN PREPARER
PENALTY PROGRAM IS QUESTIONABLE

Order No.:  GAO/GGD-91-12
Pages:  73

Almost half the individual income tax returns filed in 1989
were done by paid return preparers. The Internal Revenue
Service has had problems with what it characterizes as
incompetent and unscrupulous tax return preparers who
understate their clients' tax liabilities. GAO found that
IRS needs to better ensure that preparers engaged in
negligent or abusive tax practices are penalized. Although
IRS generally assesses the right penalty once it decides to
penalize a preparer, penalty cases are often not opened when
potential preparer misconduct was evident on returns with at
least $5,000 in taxes owed. This limits IRS' ability to
penalize preparers who are guilty of misconduct and may
weaken the agency's ability to deter preparer misconduct for
the large number of returns not reviewed in IRS' examination
program. IRS examiners and their supervisors said that they
were reluctant to pursue the penalties because of the low
dollar amounts involved.  Even though preparer penalties may
not yield significant revenues, GAO believes that their
potential long-term effect in encouraging voluntary
compliance by preparers and their clients should also be
considered. GAO also found that IRS district offices
sometimes assess different penalties and penalty amounts for
similar misconduct. IRS referral of taxpayer preparers for
disciplinary action can provide further incentives for
compliance. However, the effectiveness of this process is
limited because referrals are often not made when required.

INTERNATIONAL AVIATION:  IMPLICATIONS OF RATIFYING MONTREAL
AVIATION PROTOCOL NO. 3

Order No.:  GAO/RCED-91-45
Pages:  18

The U.S. government has long been dissatisfied with the low
level of compensation allowed under international law for
injuries or deaths resulting from international aviation
accidents. Under current agreements to which the United
States is a party, an airline is liable for a maximum of
only $75,000 per passenger. A new agreement--Montreal
Aviation Protocol No. 3--is now before the U.S. Senate for
ratification, accompanied by a plan to provide supplemental
compensation for victims of international aviation
disasters. Overall, GAO concludes that American victims of
international aviation accidents and their families would be
better compensated under Protocol No. 3 than under existing
internal agreements. Claimants would no longer have to prove
that the airline was at fault before they received
compensation, and incentives would be provided for airlines
to settle claims quickly. Claimants' costs would be reduced
because in many cases a trial would be avoided. In addition,
the Protocol would raise the airlines' liability limit,
provide funds for additional compensation of victims, and
decrease the proportion of the damage awards that go to
paying claimants' legal costs. The Protocol and the plan
would also increase the likelihood that Americans' lawsuits
would be tried in U.S. courts if compensation offers are
unsatisfactory, resulting in U.S. standards of compensation
being used in determining damage awards. Finally, GAO
concludes that Protocol No. 3 is unlikely to harm airline
safety.  Adverse economic impacts due to aviation accidents
and government safety regulations--not fear of litigation--
are the primary incentives for airlines to operate safely.

TRUCK SAFETY:  IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED IN FHWA'S MOTOR CARRIER
SAFETY PROGRAM

Order No:  GAO/RCED-91-30
Pages:  28

To promote the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles,
the Federal Highway Administration is required to develop a
way to ensure the safety fitness of owners and operators. In
October 1986, FHWA began a safety review program to educate
motor carriers--persons or companies that transport goods or
passengers as a business--about federal safety regulations
and to rate the safety management controls that carriers
have in place to comply with these regulations. GAO found
that FHWA had rated about 40 percent of the interstate motor
carriers in business as of May 1990. While the agency has
accomplished a great deal, about 129,000 carriers still need
to be rated before FHWA'S established deadline of September
30, 1992. GAO believes that FHWA is unlikely to meet this
deadline because (1) the universe of carriers is constantly
changing (due to the entry of new carriers and carriers that
merge and go out of business) and (2) FHWA has assigned a
limited number of safety investigators to this task.
Although 70 percent of the motor carriers assessed under the
safety review program received a less than satisfactory
rating, FHWA has not adequately implemented its two follow-
up procedures for ensuring that carriers correct
deficiencies in safety management controls--certification
letters from carriers and compliance reviews. Until FHWA
knows whether carriers have improved their controls, it
cannot be sure that its safety review program is promoting
the safe operation of commercial vehicles.

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL:  EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE OCEANIC SYSTEM
DELAYED

Order No.:  GAO/IMTEC-91-2
Pages:  13

Air traffic control services in non-radar oceanic areas
remain essentially unchanged from the 1950s, with oceanic
air traffic controllers still manually updating flight
progress on the basis of periodic radio reports received
from pilots. This labor-intensive and time-consuming process
results in large separation distances between aircraft, long
flights, and lost opportunities for fuel savings. While FAA
has started to provide oceanic controllers with automation
support, the agency's primary modernization effort--the
Oceanic Display and Planning System, still not fully
operational, is over three years behind schedule, and is now
more than three times the original contract cost. FAA'S
long-term strategy is to use satellites to provide accurate,
near real-time control information on oceanic flights;
however, because this strategy now relies on the successful
deployment of the Oceanic Display and Planning System, the
outcome of this approach is unknown.

Schnuck Markets, Inc. Seeks Approval to Divest Twenty-three
Supermarkets in St. Louis Area

FOR YOUR INFORMATION......................JANUARY 10, 1996

     Schnuck Markets, Inc. has applied for Federal Trade
Commission approval to divest 23 St. Louis, Missouri-area
supermarkets to Family Company of America, which intends to
operate the stores as a single grocery chain under the "National"
trade name (see attached list of stores proposed for
divestiture).  The application will be subject to public comment
until Feb. 9.

     Schnucks is based in St. Louis.  Family Company of America
is a newly-formed company, also based in St. Louis, and its
senior management consists largely of former senior managers of
the National Holdings, Inc. supermarket chain.  The divestitures
are required under a 1995 consent order Schnucks signed to settle
FTC charges that the firm's acquisition of supermarkets owned by
National Holdings, Inc. would violate federal antitrust law and
potentially lead to anticompetitive pricing and other conduct
that could hurt supermarket customers in the St. Louis area.  The
consent order requires 24 supermarket divestitures so as to
restore competition.  Schnucks stated in its application that it
still is seeking a buyer for the 24th store.

     According to the application, the proposed divestiture plan
will establish a "substantial competitive force in the market." 
Family would be the third-largest competitor in the market and
its size "will enable it to take advantage of available economies
of scale, especially in such areas as purchasing and advertising,
and its use of the  National' trade name will help ensure an
immediate procompetitive impact," the application states. 
Schnucks also maintains that the proposed subleases of real
estate on which some of the stores are owned "will not adversely
affect the ability of incentives of Family, Schnucks, or any
other party to compete."

     Comments on the application should be addressed to the FTC,
Office of the Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.   Copies of the application and the
order are available from the FTC's Public Reference Branch, Room
130, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.

Praxair to Settle FTC Charges Over CBI Acquisition;
Will Divest Four CBI Plants to Restore Competition

FOR RELEASE:  JANUARY 11, 1996

     Praxair, Inc. has agreed to divest four atmospheric gases
production plants to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that its $2
billion acquisition of CBI Industries, Inc. would violate federal
antitrust laws, reduce competition and raise prices in the market for
atmospheric gases produced off-site for industrial customers in several
areas of the country.

     Praxair, based in Danbury, Connecticut, is the largest supplier of
industrial gases, including atmospheric gases, in America, and the third
largest supplier worldwide.  CBI, which competes with Praxair, is
headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois.  

     The products at issue in the case are "merchant" atmospheric gases
-- nitrogen, oxygen and argon -- supplied to customers via tanker truck
or in cylinders (as opposed to atmospheric gases produced for customers
on-site or near their production facilities.)  Merchant nitrogen is used
in industrial applications such as heat treating, chemical blanketing
and freezing.  Merchant oxygen is used in foundries, steel and glass
production and for medical purposes.  Merchant argon is primarily used
for welding. There are no adequate substitutes for any of the three
gases, the FTC alleged.

     According to the FTC complaint detailing the charges, the
acquisition would reduce competition in the merchant oxygen and nitrogen
markets in both northern and southern California, and also would reduce
competition for merchant nitrogen, oxygen and argon in eastern
Connecticut and western Wisconsin/southeastern Minnesota.  Entry by a
new firm in those markets would be time consuming, costly and unlikely,
the complaint says.  Thus, the proposed acquisition would violate
federal antitrust laws in those areas by:

     -- eliminating direct competition between Praxair and CBI;     

     -- enhancing the likelihood of collusion or other anticompetitive
practices among the      remaining competitors in California;

     -- eliminating competition between the two closest competitors in
eastern Connecticut      and the two closest competitors in western
Wisconsin and southeastern Minnesota;

     -- increasing the likelihood that Praxair would unilaterally
exercise market power in      eastern Connecticut, western Wisconsin and
southeastern Minnesota; and,

     -- increasing the likelihood that prices for the gases would
increase in those geographic  areas.

     The proposed consent agreement to settle the charges and restore
competition would require Praxair to divest, individually or in some
combination, CBI's atmospheric gas production facilities in Vacaville
and Irwindale, California; Bozrah, Connecticut; and Madison, Wisconsin.
The proposed divestitures would have to be completed within 12 months
from the date the order becomes final.  If Praxair were to fail to
divest the assets within the specified time frame, the Commission could
appoint a trustee to divest the four plants. 

     To remedy any anticompetitive effects of the acquisition pending
divestiture, Praxair must maintain the four CBI production facilities as
viable, independent competitors of Praxair's nearby plants. 
Accordingly, Praxair has agreed to hold the plants separate from its
other businesses and take steps to assure that no confidential
information is exchanged between the plants and those other businesses. 

     The Commission vote to accept the proposed consent agreement for
public comment was 5-0.  The proposed consent agreement will be
published in the Federal Register shortly and will be subject to public
comment for 60 days, after which the Commission will decide whether to
make it final.  Comments should be addressed to the FTC, Office of the
Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20580.

NOTE: A consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not
constitute an admission of a law violation.  When the Commission issues
a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law with
respect to future actions.  Each violation of such an order may result
in a civil penalty of $10,000.

     Copies of the complaint, the proposed consent agreement and an
analysis of the agreement to aid the public in commenting, are available
from the FTC's Public Reference Branch, Room 130, at the address listed
above; 202-326-2222; TTY for the hearing impaired 202-326-2502.  To find

Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation Petitions to Modify
an Agreement in Connection with its Acquisition of
Healthtrust, Inc.

FOR YOUR INFORMATION...........................JANUARY 11, 1995

     Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, of Nashville,
Tennessee, has petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to modify
an agreement between the firm and the agency reached in
connection with the firm's acquisition of Healthtrust, Inc..  The
requested modification would eliminate Columbia/HCA's obligations
to "hold separate" the Utah Healthtrust assets pending
divestiture of a lease for commercial office space in a third-party-owned 
building in the Salt Lake City area after
Columbia/HCA's divestiture of certain Utah hospitals.  The FTC is
seeking public comments on the petition for 10 days, until Jan.
22.  Columbia/HCA stated in this petition that, shortly, it will
submit a second petition in which it will seek to end its
obligation to divest the lease.

     The agreement at issue accompanies a consent order that
Columbia/HCA signed to settle FTC charges that its $3 billion
merger with Healthtrust would impair hospital competition --
leading to higher prices, reduced services, or both -- in areas
of Florida, Louisiana, Texas and Utah.  To restore that
competition, the consent order requires a total of seven
divestitures and mandates that Columbia/HCA terminate its
participation in a joint venture.  Under the accompanying "hold
separate" agreement, Columbia/HCA is required to operate the
assets to be divested independently of its other hospitals.

     Columbia/HCA maintains in its petition that the lease is for
office space used by a company, Infusamed, that provided home
health/home infusion services and pharmacy services. The consent
order did not require Columbia to divest Infusamed.  And this is
a different market than the market at issue in the FTC case,
which is acute care inpatient hospital services, the petition
states.

     Comments should be addressed to the FTC, Office of the
Secretary, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20580.

     Copies of the petition, and of the consent order and hold
separate agreement are available from the FTC's Public Reference
Branch, Room 130, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20580; 202-326-2222; TTY for the hearing

                    Promotion; Public Hearing

                       Docket No. 95N-0227

                     Comments of the Staff of
                the Bureau of Consumer Protection
                   and the Bureau of Economics
                 of the Federal Trade Commission


January 11, 1996

    Introduction.

     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested
comments regarding the promotion of prescription drug products
directly to consumers (DTC) through print, broadcast, and other
media.  Among other things, the agency announced that it "is
particularly interested in exploring whether, and, if so, how,
the agency's current regulatory approach should be modified."  
The staffs of the Bureau of Consumer Protection and the Bureau of
Economics of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offer the
following comments to assist the FDA in its deliberations, based
on our experience in analyzing the effects of information in
consumer product markets and in considering legal requirements
that address information issues.

     The FTC enforces the Federal Trade Commission Act, which
among other things prohibits deceptive or unfair practices in or
affecting commerce.  One of the FTC's primary responsibilities is
to enforce the law prohibiting deceptive practices in national
advertising.  The FTC considers the prevention of deceptive
health-related advertising claims to be of utmost importance, and
has taken action in numerous cases involving deceptive health-related 
claims about OTC drugs, food products, dietary
supplements, and medical devices.  In implementing its mandate,
the FTC has developed considerable expertise in the role of
advertising in the consumer information environment.

     The staff of the Commission also has experience examining
the effects of laws affecting advertising on market performance,
including in the prescription drug market.  While important
differences between advertising for prescription drugs and
advertising for other products might lead to different
approaches, we believe that the staff's experience, particularly
regarding marketing and economic issues, has a bearing on many of
the DTC advertising issues on which the FDA is seeking comment.

     Truthful and non-misleading advertising can help consumers
manage their own health care.  Advertisements can, for example,
provide timely information regarding medical advances, remind
consumers about good health care practices, and supply
information needed by consumers to understand and evaluate their
physician's recommendations.  On the other hand, deceptive or
misleading advertisements in the prescription drug area can
impose particularly high costs on consumers.  Whether or not a
particular advertisement might mislead consumers will turn on the
specific facts associated with that ad (and a determination of
the claims being made).  Any analysis of the likelihood of
deception would therefore depend on a case by case evaluation. 
The FTC staff believes that the Commission's Deception Policy
Statement and its Statement on Advertising Substantiation may
assist the FDA in evaluating prescription drug advertisements.

II.  The Potential Effects of DTC Advertising on Consumers and
     the Marketplace. 

     Assessments of DTC regulatory options are likely to depend
on one's understanding of DTC advertising's effects on consumers
and the marketplace.  In this section we consider this issue. 
First, we consider the incentives to provide consumers with
information about drug therapies.  Second, we describe the unique
role of advertising, in general, and of DTC prescription drug
advertising, in particular, in the consumer information
environment.  Third, we describe the potential effects of DTC
advertising on competition.  Finally, we consider how regulations
can be designed to encourage the potentially beneficial effects
of advertising while discouraging its potentially harmful
effects.

     A.   Incentives to Provide Consumers with Information About
          Alternative Drug Therapies.

     We believe this is a particularly good time to examine the
potential value of DTC advertising.  With the growth of managed
care organizations, consumers are expected to become more
actively involved in their health care decisions and to demand
more information on alternative therapies.  The recent growth
of DTC pharmaceutical advertising expenditures is consistent
with the view that consumers are demanding more product
information. 

     Substantial information about drug therapies is provided to
consumers by independent parties.  Newspapers report on new
drugs, books describe drug options, magazines discuss
alternative therapies, and public health organizations provide
a wealth of information.
 
     Despite the existence of these sources, economic reasoning
suggests that advertising can be an important supplemental source
of information.  Information, like most goods, is costly to
provide.  However, in contrast to most products, information is
not used up when it is consumed, and it is often possible to use
information without paying for it, that is, to "free ride."  As a
result, markets may tend to provide consumers with less than the
optimal amount of information.

     Advertising can reduce this problem.  Firms will provide
health information to consumers when it is profitable to do so. 
Profitability depends on several factors that affect the 
marginal benefits and costs of advertising.  For example,
extensive disclosure requirements can substantially increase the
cost of advertising, thereby decreasing a firm's incentive to
advertise. (Of course, such disclosures may nonetheless be
needed sometimes to prevent deception).

     Firms have strong incentives to provide information about
disease conditions and possible treatments if they can associate
the information with products they sell.  Although firms with
relatively large market shares may find it profitable to provide
advertising messages that do not make such an association,
smaller competitors are less likely to find such advertising
profitable, due to the "free-riding" phenomenon.
  
     Incentives to advertise are also enhanced when firms can
initiate new campaigns quickly.  For example, the sooner
information on product improvements reaches consumers, the sooner
firms can begin through sales to recoup research and development
investments and advertising expenditures.  Similarly, the
incentive to advertise is likely to be greater when firms can
respond rapidly to advertising by competitors.

     B.   Prescription Drug Advertising as a Unique Source of
          Some Information that Can Enhance Consumer Welfare.

     Prescription drug advertising, like any type of advertising,
represents only one component of the total consumer information
environment, which includes the media, package inserts, reference
books, doctors, and pharmacists.  Advertising, like any of these
components, is better at some tasks than others.  For example,
broadcast advertisements are relatively good for disseminating
short bits of information to large audiences but not for
providing complex information.  Complex information is often
disseminated more effectively at another point in the product
consideration and purchasing process, such as through labeling at
the point of sale.  Although reference books that describe drug
characteristics are useful, they may lack information about
recent innovations and may not reach a wide audience.  In
contrast, advertising can inform about product innovations as
soon as they are brought to market.  Advertising can also remind
people of information that they might already know but that has
faded from memory.

     Different forms of advertising may have different advantages
and disadvantages as means of communicating information.  Complex
information is often communicated more effectively through print
media than through broadcast media.  Internet advertising may be
particularly efficient at reaching small sub-populations with a
strong interest in certain types of drugs.
  
     Obviously, one concern with advertised information is that
manufacturers will be inclined to favor their products. 
Although some forces weigh against this outcome, they may be
insufficient to prevent firms from making unfounded claims,
whether intentionally or inadvertently.  Deceptive claims in the
prescription drug area can have serious consequences.

     Although prescription drug advertising shares many
characteristics of advertising in other markets, prescription
drugs have several characteristics that make the analysis of
prescription drug advertising to consumers distinctive.  For
example, product safety and efficacy is a particularly important
issue in this advertising market.  At the product level, this
concern is addressed by the requirement that all prescription
drugs be pre-approved by the FDA for safety and efficacy. 
 
     Concerns about product safety and efficacy are reflected in
control of access to prescription drugs.  Doctors must prescribe
them, and they must be dispensed by pharmacists.  These controls
should help ensure that inappropriate drugs are not used.

     Advertising may make consumers aware of more convenient or
otherwise more desirable versions of drugs than those they
currently use.  Advertising may encourage consumers to see a
doctor for advice about conditions they might have previously
ignored or for further information about conditions already being
treated.  Advertising may cause consumers to inquire about
diagnostic tests that might not otherwise be performed.  Better
informed consumers will be better able to understand and discuss
their individual needs with their doctors and pharmacists.  Thus,
advertising can help consumers make decisions about their health
care and health care costs.  

     C.   Potential Effects of Prescription Drug Advertising on
          Price and Quality Competition.

     Advertising is an important catalyst for price and quality
competition.  Advertising can put downward pressure on prices by
spurring competition among alternative therapies.  To the
extent that prescription drugs compete with OTC drugs,
prescription drug advertising potentially can lead to lower
average prices for both product categories.  We recognize,
however, that the ultimate effect is likely to depend on the
evolution of the health care market and on the individual
characteristics of drug classes and disease conditions.
  
     Quality competition can also be motivated by advertising. 
Advertising can help foster product improvements by delivering
information to consumers on quality variables that they may not
otherwise know about.  If consumers prefer products with the
advertised qualities and receive prescriptions for these products
after consulting with their doctors, then their demand for the
advertised products is reflected in sales and the market reflects
consumer preferences.

     D.   Considerations Regarding Regulation.

     We believe that truthful and non-deceptive DTC advertising
can contribute to consumers' health information environment and 
consumer welfare.  A review of some recent DTC advertising
suggests beneficial outcomes are likely, because many
advertisements focus on the types of claims that we would expect
to help consumers, such as, for example, improved convenience and
cost advantages.  In addition, recent consumer research evidence
suggests that DTC advertisements are likely to encourage people
to seek advice from their doctors, which may result in improved
health care. 

     In a regulatory scheme for DTC advertising, therefore, we
would encourage balancing the benefits and the risks of allowing
pharmaceutical manufacturers greater latitude in their
advertising.  In particular, it is important to protect consumers
from deceptive information but not to stifle truthful information
that could benefit consumers.  As discussed below, we believe
that the net benefits of DTC advertisements can be increased by
limiting current disclosure requirements and by adjusting
disclosure requirements according to the characteristics of
different advertising venues.

III. The FTC's Approach to Advertising.

     During the FDA's public hearings on October 18 and 19, 1995,
regarding DTC prescription drug advertising, many commentators
suggested that the FDA consider adopting an approach similar to
that used by the FTC.  In light of these suggestions, it may be
helpful for us to describe the framework used by the FTC
concerning deceptive advertising.

     The Commission's policy with respect to deceptive
advertising is set out in its Deception Policy Statement and
its Statement on Advertising Substantiation.  An advertisement
is considered deceptive if it contains a representation or
omission that is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably
under the circumstances, and the representation or omission is
material, that is, it is likely to affect consumers' decisions
regarding purchase or use of a product.  Thus, the FTC's
approach involves identifying the claims that are conveyed by an
advertisement, both expressly and by implication, and determining
whether those claims are truthful and substantiated. 
 
     In analyzing an advertisement, the FTC focuses on the net
impression it conveys rather than on the individual elements of
the ad in isolation.  Because advertisements can mislead
consumers by what they do not say as well as by what they do say,
the omission of material information may also render an
advertisement deceptive in some circumstances.  Deception can
occur through omission of information when that information is
necessary to prevent an affirmative representation from being
misleading, or simply by remaining silent, if doing so
constitutes an implied but false representation.  The
Commission has made clear, however, that "[n]ot all omissions are
deceptive, even if providing the information would benefit
consumers."  An omission is considered deceptive only if the
absence of the information causes the advertisement to convey an
inaccurate impression about a material fact. 
  
     The FTC's focus when analyzing the adequacy of disclosures
is on their effectiveness in communicating the necessary
information in the context of the advertising at issue.  When
disclosure of information is necessary to prevent an
advertisement from conveying an inaccurate impression, the mere
physical presence of the information may not be sufficient to
prevent the ad from being considered deceptive.  Thus, the
information must be included in a manner that is calculated to be
noticed, read (or heard, if orally presented), and comprehended
by consumers.

IV.  Considering DTC Prescription Drug Advertising Issues in
     Light of the FTC's Approach.

     A.   The "Brief Summary."

     The FDA in its Federal Register Notice asked whether, and if
so, how, the "brief summary" disclosure requirements for
prescription drug advertising should be modified in the context
of consumer directed advertising for prescription drugs.
  
     Under an FTC deception analysis, the primary questions would
be whether the brief summary requirements are necessary to
prevent deception, and, if so, whether they effectively
communicate the necessary information to consumers.  Pursuant
to the FTC's deception authority, this would be a case-by-case
analysis, as the focus would be on the net impression conveyed by
a specific advertisement, and whether any or all of the brief
summary requirements would be necessary to prevent that
advertisement from conveying a deceptive impression.

     The FTC's experience in enforcing the law pertaining to
deception indicates that it is often difficult to effectively
communicate information to consumers.  More complicated messages
are more difficult to convey to consumers in an understandable
manner.  Fine print disclosures, whether in print or broadcast
advertising, are often insufficient to effectively communicate
important information.

     The "brief summary" that currently appears in consumer
directed prescription drug advertising is obviously highly
technical, complicated, and lengthy.  It is often presented in
fine print, in language that is designed for health care
professionals rather than lay persons.  We believe that the
information contained therein is therefore unlikely to be readily
focused on and understood by consumers. 

     Moreover, if the "brief summary" included information that
was necessary to prevent deception or other consumer injury, we
would be concerned that it would not be effectively communicated
by the current format.  The sheer volume of information required
to be disclosed may itself contribute to a reduced comprehension
of any such specific important information.

     Alternative means could be considered for ensuring consumer
access to information that is important for consumers to have but
that is not necessary to prevent deception or injury.  For
instance, certain kinds of DTC advertisements could provide an
"800" number for consumers to call for further information, or
an alternative source for consumers to obtain the information. 
They could also encourage consumers to ask their doctors about
product risks and benefits and to ask their pharmacists for
package insert information.

     B.   Tailoring Regulation to the Advertising Medium.

     The FDA also asked whether broadcast advertisements should
be subject to the same "brief summary" requirements as
advertisements in other media.  

     Differences among media may affect the likelihood of
deception from advertising claims and, therefore, the
appropriateness of particular approaches to preventing deception. 
Television advertising typically is presented in thirty to sixty
second lengths, although fifteen and even ten second
advertisements are not uncommon.  The brevity of television
advertising makes it very difficult to include lengthy or complex
disclosures, or to do so in a comprehensible manner.  Print
advertising, on the other hand, is more conducive to
communicating relatively complex information than TV advertising
because people can read print advertisements at their own speed,
and even re-read the information if so inclined.  Similarly,
advertising on the Internet can be read at one's own pace and can
be saved or printed for future reference.  Thus, a claim read
quickly in a broadcast advertisement might present a different
likelihood of deception than does the same claim appearing in a
print or on-line format.  Given the variety of media in which
advertising appears, it may be appropriate in designing measures
to prevent deception, such as disclosure requirements, to take
into account practical differences among various advertising
venues.  For instance, the FTC has recognized these differences
and in some cases in which disclosures have been imposed has
designed abbreviated versions for use in broadcast media.  If
necessary, abbreviated disclosures could be supplemented through
requirements that more detailed information be made available on
request and that consumers be made aware of this option.

     The FDA has also requested comments regarding the regulation
of new advertising technologies, such as the Internet.  Although
developing information technologies present new possibilities for
the innovative delivery of valuable information to consumers,
these technologies can be used to deceive consumers.  Although
new media such as the Internet clearly present new challenges
with respect to monitoring and enforcing laws against deception,
we believe that the core principles underlying the FTC's
deception policy apply as well to these developing technologies
as to more traditional advertising media.

     C.   Identifying the Source of an Advertisement.

     The FDA also seeks comment concerning infomercials and
manufacturer-supported DTC promotions that appear to be sponsored
by independent third-party services.

     Consumers' evaluation of information may be affected by an
inaccurate perception regarding its sponsorship.  A potential for
deception therefore exists when consumers do not know that what
appears to be a news broadcast or other programming is really an
infomercial, or that what appears to be independently supplied
information is really supplied by a product's manufacturer.

     This concern about infomercials underlies numerous actions
in recent years by the FTC, challenging the formats used as
deceptive.  In these cases, the FTC typically barred
advertisers from misrepresenting the nature of the "program" and
required them to disclose, at the beginning of an infomercial and
immediately before any product ordering information, that what
consumers are watching is a paid commercial.

     The FTC also has addressed the third-party endorsement
issue, both in its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and
Testimonials in Advertising and in law enforcement actions. 
The Guides suggest that the connections between an endorser and a
seller of an advertised product that "might materially affect the
weight or credibility of the endorsement (i.e., the connection is
not  reasonably expected by the audience')," should be
disclosed.  The FTC has applied the standards described in the
Guides in particular cases, involving endorsers that were
business associates of the marketer, an endorser that was an
officer or director, an endorser that was an employee of the
advertiser, and an endorser that was a product distributor. 
The concern in these cases is that the endorsers had an
undisclosed financial interest in promoting the products.  Again,
the likelihood of deception depends on the specifics of an
individual ad, and the analysis is therefore conducted on a case-by-case basis.

     D.   Regulation of Price Advertising.

     As the FDA reviews its advertising regulations, one issue
not mentioned in the Notice may also deserve attention.  The
FDA's existing brief summary requirements may have the
inadvertent effect of unnecessarily restricting the dissemination
of price information.  While the FDA regulations exempt certain
types of price claims from the brief summary requirement, the
exemption is narrow and apparently would apply only to
advertisements of the price of a specific quantity of a drug, and
not, for instance, to comparative price claims, coupons or other
forms of price reduction information. 
 
     The brief summary requirement adds to the cost of
advertising and may be expected therefore to reduce the amount of
advertising.  With respect to price advertising, therefore, the
brief summary requirements may result in less price competition. 
Price advertising can result in lower prices for consumers.  We
therefore suggest that FDA evaluate whether its limitations on
the exemption for price claims are necessary and desirable.

End of the line for pipeline deal


Hours after the FTC entered federal court to block Questar Corporation from
acquiring a 50 percent interest in Kern River Gas Transmission Company from
Tenneco, Inc., the parties called off the deal.  In the past, the parties
would nevertheless be facing a lengthy administrative trial, the price for
having forced the FTC's hand.  But under the Commission's new enforcement
policy, the matter is now moot.

The $226 million transaction would have given Questar a monopoly over natural
gas transmission services in the Salt Lake City area, the FTC charged in its
short-lived suit.

Questar had a monopoly until 1992, the FTC said, when the Kern River pipeline
opened to provide competition in the area.  Kern River is jointly and
equally-owned by Tenneco and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company.  Allowing Questar
to gain half ownership in Kern River would halt newly emerged competition in
the area, according to the agency.

A senior FTC official said the agency is paying "special attention" to
acquisitions in this newly deregulated industry and assigned at least 10
Competition Bureau attorneys to this investigation.  In this instance, the
official said, the staff identified an unusually strong "potential
competition" case:  although the acquired company hadn't made a single sale in
the market in which the acquiring company was selling, it had been making
offers and Questar allegedly always lowered its price and won the business.

The case, filed in federal district court in Utah, bears a striking
resemblance to the Justice Department's successful attempt to halt the
acquisition of one California natural gas company by another area company in
the 1960s.  The district court allowed that transaction to proceed.  But the
Supreme Court, in U.S.  v.  El Paso Natural Gas Co., et.  al.  (376 U.S.  651)
reversed the district court, ruling that mere attempts by the acquired company
to enter the market -- though unsuccessful -- had a "powerful influence" on
the market.

Questar's decision to abandon the transaction effectively ended the
Commission's enforcement activities in this case.  In the past, Questar could
have been facing administrative litigation.  FTC decisions on whether to
proceed with administrative litigation have been made on a case-by-case basis,
but respondents rarely escaped.

For instance, in 1991, the Commission chose not to proceed to administrative
litigation after going into court to enjoin Wiggins Teape Appleton plc from
acquiring a Vancouver, Washington paper mill owned by Boise Cascade
Corporation.  Wiggins did not abandon that transaction until 20 days after the
FTC asked a federal court for a preliminary injunction.

Under the Commission's new policy it is standard for the agency to close cases
once the acquisition in question is abandoned.  The FTC previously pursued
most cases administratively when the parties pushed the matter into court,
even if only to get an order requiring prior approval of future transactions.
Prior approval provisions in orders are now the exception, not the rule, under
the Commission's new policy.

Atmospheric gas merger challenged
Three little gases; no little substitutes


The $2 billion pairing of Praxair, Inc., America's largest industrial gas
supplier, and CBI Industries, Inc.  would likely harm competition for
atmospheric gases in several parts of the country, the FTC charged last week.
The U.S.  market as a whole would not suffer, but parts of California, the
midwest and the northeast could be hard hit in markets for nitrogen, oxygen
and argon, according to the FTC.  Praxair has agreed to divest four merchant
atmospheric gas production plants to settle those charges.

Those who stayed awake through science class know that nitrogen, oxygen and
argon are the three "atmospheric gases."  They are also very popular
commercial, or "merchant," gases and are shipped to customers either as a
liquid, by tanker truck, or in cylinders.

Nitrogen is used to create inert environments for heat treating and chemical
blanketing.  Food industries and others also use nitrogen for freezing
products.  Oxygen is used for combustion and oxidation in foundries, steel and
glass plants and for medical purposes.  Argon is used primarily for welding.
The common trait of all three gases is that they have no common traits with
other gases; there are no suitable substitutes for any of the three.

But the gases also have their differences, and the FTC's case against Praxair
carefully balances those differences.  Nitrogen and oxygen can be economically
shipped only 150 to 300 miles, for instance, while argon -- a more expensive
gas -- can be economically shipped much longer distances, up to about 1,000
miles, according to the FTC.

If Praxair were to acquire CBI, unfettered by divestiture, the Northern and
Southern California markets for nitrogen and oxygen could be hard hit, the
agency charged.  In both areas, five competitors would become four.  In
Northern California the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) would jump 431 points
to 3366, and Praxair would control 32 percent of the market, the FTC said.  In
Southern California, the HHI would take a similar jump, 440 points, landing at
2727 in a market where Praxair would dominate with a 34.8 percent share.

Nitrogen and oxygen markets in the Northern Midwest and Northeastern U.S.  --
and narrower markets therein, such as the Western Wisconsin/Southeastern
Minnesota area and Eastern Connecticut -- could also be harmed, according to
the FTC.

The same goes for the merchant argon markets in Eastern Connecticut and the
Western Wisconsin/Southeastern Minnesota area, where Praxair and CBI are "each
other's closest geographic competitor."  CBI's share of the argon market is
small, the FTC said.  But because its plant is so close to Praxair's in those
two areas, "localized unilateral anticompetitive effects are likely."

Praxair has agreed to divest four of CBI's atmospheric gas production
facilities.  Plants will be divested in Vacaville, California; Irwindale,
California; Bozrah, Connecticut; and Madison, Wisconsin.

Cranial shunt divestiture ordered
in Johnson & Johnson merger


Johnson & Johnson's $1.8 billion merger with Cordis Corporation snagged in the
market for cranial shunts last month.  Johnson & Johnson has agreed to divest
the Cordis's neuroscience business to a Commission-approved buyer within one
year to settle charges that the acquisition would place 85% of the U.S.
neurological shunt market into the hands of only two firms.

Neurological shunts are used to treat patients -- primarily children --
suffering from the potentially fatal brain disorder hydrocephalus, which
involves excessive pressure on the brain from an increase of fluid in the
skull.  The shunts, once installed, divert cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the
bloodstream of patients suffering from hydrocephalus.

Combining the shunt businesses of Johnson & Johnson and Cordis would raise the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to 4059 for the market, the FTC charged.  The
merger would likely lead to higher prices and reduced innovation in the
market, according to the agency.

Johnson & Johnson has agreed to divest the Cordis neuroscience business, which
includes shunts, intracranial pressure drainage systems and neuroendoscopy
products, tools used to install shunts.  The FTC alleged competitive problems
only in the market for shunts.  But "[significant synergies between the
products manufactured and sold by the [Cordis neuroscience business] exist,
and Cordis's shunts are sold as part of a broader product line," the FTC staff
said in its analysis.  "Therefore, a divestiture of the whole business is
necessary to maintain competition in the shunt market."

There is one potential snag to the divestiture:  a joint venture between
Cordis and Nobles-Lai Engineering, Inc.  to research, develop and manufacture
neuroendoscopy products.  If Nobles-Lai asserts contractual rights, the
divestiture could be held up, allowing Nobles-Lai to benefit from Johnson &
Johnson's marketing outlet and possibly giving Johnson & Johnson control over
Cordis, a situation the proposed order was meant to prevent.

To prevent that from occurring the proposed order includes an insurance
policy.  If Nobles-Lai asserts contractual rights, Johnson & Johnson has
agreed not to contract with Nobles-Lai to research, develop or market any
neuroendoscopy products.  Johnson & Johnson further agreed not to purchase
from or distribute for Nobles-Lai any such products.

Going public - A different divestiture


Oerlikon-Buhrle Holding AG has proposed using Wall Street to divest one of its
subsidiaries in the first divestiture by initial public offering (IPO) of
stock overseen by the FTC.  As envisioned, the company would not directly
divest to another company its turbomolecular pump subsidiary, Balzers-Pfeiffer
GmbH, but would instead offer the shares in Balzers-Pfeiffer.  After that, the
pump unit would operate as a stand-alone business.

Divestiture of Balzers-Pfeiffer is required under a 1995 order settling
charges that Switzerland-based Oerlikon-Buhrle's acquisition of Leybold AG, a
German corporation, would harm competition in the U.S.  turbomolecular pump
market.  Turbomolecular pumps are small "jet engine-like devices" which
produce high vacuum atmospheres used in the production of semiconductors.
[FTC:WATCH No.  422, November 7, 1994]

The FTC has requested public comment until February 1 on the proposed IPO,
though no details of the plan are currently available.  Oerlikon-Buhrle must
first jump through Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hoops before
Balzers-Pfeiffer can go public, and securities law prohibits disclosure of all
but the most basic data about an IPO until a registration statement has been
filed with the SEC.  Once that statement has been filed, the Commission plans
to offer the public an additional opportunity to comment, though not
necessarily an additional 30 days.

The FTC has approved novel forms of divestiture in the past.  In March, 1994
it approved Valspar Corporation's plan to combine four of its own plants and
five plants from a company it acquired into a new company, which was then spun
off to shareholders.  That divestiture settled concerns raised when Valspar
acquired the Resin Products Division of Cargill, Inc.  [FTC:WATCH No.  408,

For the next five years --
Buy your toys in Pennsylvania


Pennsylvania's attorney general has persuaded Playmobil USA, Inc.  to donate
$201,000 to 12 charities and another $50,000 to the state's litigation fund to
settle allegations that the firm and its German parent, geobra Brandstaetter
GmbH & Co.  KG have been keeping the prices of "toy figures, playsets and
accessories" artificially high through a resale price maintenance program.

The agreement, filed in U.S.  District Court for the Middle District of
Pennsylvania, also enjoins Playmobil from "entering into any contract,
combination, conspiracy, agreement or arrangement with any Pennsylvania dealer
to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize the retail prices at which Playmobil
products are sold to the public, or at which Pennsylvania dealers may
advertise Playmobil products."  [emphasis added]

Playmobil is also enjoined "from adopting or establishing any cooperative
advertising policy that denies or reduces advertising rebates or allowances to
a Pennsylvania dealer for any reason related to that dealer's advertised
prices."  [emphasis added]

The consent decree also bars Playmobil from cutting off dealers or
discriminating against them with regard to supply or credit terms "for failing
to adhere to any of Playmobil USA's suggested retail price for those
products."

On the other hand, Playmobil may continue to suggest prices.

The order terminates in five years.

Cigarettes under siege:
The tobacco industry's
two-front federal battle


While the tobacco industry dug in to fight against tobacco advertising
regulations proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the FTC poised
itself to attack from the rear last month.  The agency staff, responding to
suggestions from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is busy readying a
proposal for the FTC that could change the way cigarette tar, nicotine and
carbon monoxide values are determined and how they are advertised.

An NCI panel announced it would suggest changes a year ago after concluding
the FTC testing procedures yield tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide figures
that do not accurately reflect the amount of those substances consumers
actually get from smoking.  The tobacco industry may agree with that
conclusion, according to a December 28 Wall Street Journal report.  The report
quotes an internal Philip Morris document that said the FTC testing method
"should be retained:  It gives low ratings."

Consumer Protection Bureau Chief Jodie Bernstein acknowledged that her staff
is working on a proposal based on the NCI panel's suggestions.  The NCI has
not yet released an official report of the two-day conference conducted by its
panel in December 1994 but the report is expected within the month.  The panel
itself released its findings at the conclusion of the conference.  [FTC:WATCH
No.  425, December 19, 1994]

The NCI panel recommended modifications to the FTC's testing methodology to
test the "ranges" of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in cigarettes.
Those ranges should be graphically depicted on each pack of cigarettes sold,
according to NCI, which further suggested use of "appropriate" disclaimers on
packages and in ads for cigarettes classified as either "light" or "ultra
light."  The disclaimers would inform consumers that, at best, evidence
suggests minimal health benefits from smoking lower tar cigarettes.

The FTC staff is exploring ways to change the machine testing protocols to
more accurately reflect the way smokers actually smoke, according to
Bernstein.  The staff proposal will also focus on changes in advertising that
would more accurately reflect the levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide
smokers actually get from smoking.  A graphic depiction of the ranges is among
the proposals under consideration at the FTC.

The NCI panel's suggestion of a graphic depiction of the ranges on every pack
is a recommendation that could run up against the Cigarette Labeling and
Advertising Act.  That law mandates rotating health warnings on cigarette
packages and bars the FTC from requiring any alternative warning.  But the Act
does not restrict the FTC from requiring alternative health warnings in
advertising.  It is in ads, not on packages, that the FTC staff is considering
mandating the graphs of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide values.

At the FDA

The FDA attempt to restrict tobacco advertising in the name of children is
taking heat off any FTC effort at tobacco advertising regulation.  The tobacco
industry launched a major legal strike against the FDA proposal earlier this
month, on the deadline for comments.  As the media scrambled to cover the
tobacco industry offensive, the FTC's comment to the FDA got lost in the
shuffle.

But those comments supported the FDA's goal -- to make cigarettes less
accessible and less attractive to children.  The FTC recommended narrowly
tailoring the regulations to that goal to avoid a First Amendment fight but
encouraged the FDA to "consider a coordinated regulatory enforcement approach
with state and local government agencies."

Commissioner Mary L.  Azcuenaga concurred with the FTC filing of comments at
the FDA, but only "insofar as it reflects the Commission's expertise in
analyzing advertising claims."  The constitutionality of the FDA's regulations
is not for the FTC to consider, she said.  "I would have preferred that the
Commission's comment focus on the empirical basis for the assumptions on which
the proposed regulations rest."  Azcuenaga would also have preferred that her
agency's comments have addressed those studies not contained or referenced in
the FDA notice that could "undermine the basis for the proposed regulations."
FDA will have to face that issue sooner or later if there is a First Amendment
challenge, she opined.

The FTC comments also noted that the panel's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
linked use of tobacco products by kids with advertising but did "not indicate
that tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide ratings play any role in the decisions
of children and adolescents to use tobacco products, or to choose among the
various products."

Advertising industry associations added their voices to the FDA's mountain of
comments.  It is the FTC, not the FDA, that has jurisdiction over tobacco
advertising issues, according to the American Association of Advertising
Agencies (AAAA).  The AAAA also opposes the FDA proposal on First Amendment
grounds but was careful to limit its objections to advertising issues alone.
The ad group did not address whether the FDA has authority to regulate tobacco
products as drugs.

Lighter hand proposed for
prescription drug advertising


The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should use a looser, less regulatory
style for direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of prescription drugs, the FTC
staff has advised.  Important benefits can come from DTC advertising.  But the
current structure required in ads could be limiting those benefits, said staff
members of the FTC's Economics and Consumer Protection Bureaus in comments to
the FDA last week.

Currently, disclosures that appear in ads -- known as "Brief Summaries" -- are
"highly technical, complicated and lengthy," the FTC staff said.  A better
solution might be simple disclosures advising consumers to check with their
doctors for more information.

The FDA's existing brief summary requirement may also inadvertently prevent
price advertising and the use of coupons and other price reduction devices,
according to the FTC staff.  Because price advertising can result in lower
prices, the FDA should consider whether limitations on price advertising are
"necessary and desirable."

Self-regulation may move to labels;
but NLEA not part of the plan


The current self-regulatory mandate for the advertising industry should be
extended to include claims made on product labels, a panel of advertising
industry experts has recommended.  But it is not the industry's business to
consider whether labels meet specific Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
labeling requirements, the panel said.  The National Advertising Review
Council (NARC), overseer of industry self-regulation efforts, is expected to
vote on the group's recommendations within the next few months.

The National Advertising Division (NAD) of the Better Business Bureau, the
first stop for ads in the industry's self-regulation process, has looked at
label claims in past cases.  But it has done so cautiously, admitting in a
1994 case report that "labels are not normally held to be within the
jurisdiction of the NAD."  The panel's recommendations, if accepted, would
make label inquiries commonplace.

But it is the duty of the NAD to evaluate only whether the ads are false,
deceptive or misleading, not whether the labels violate FDA or other
government regulations, the panel stressed.  The FDA maintains rules for
nutrition labeling, promulgated under the Nutrition Labeling Education Act
(NLEA), that are stricter than the FTC standards for food advertising.

In other news:

* Champion's Jogbra may be "technically unsurpassed," but the company had
insufficient evidence that its product was superior to all others in the
category "across-the-board," NAD ruled.  Champion promised to cooperate with
the NAD and "communicate more clearly" intended claims.

* John O.  Butler Company submitted test data for its Secure Denture Adhesive
Paste showing consumers preferred Secure to other denture adhesives.  The test
was flawed, the NAD ruled, and could not back claims that Secure "outholds the
leading brands."  The disputed ads are scheduled to run through January 1996,
after which they will not be repeated, the company said.

* Life Services Supplements, Inc.  agreed to modify ads for its Citri-Thin
Diet Supplement after the NAD expressed concerns that the ads might suggest
that Citri-Thin alone could help shed and keep off pounds.  The ads should
include a statement informing consumers that a proper diet and exercise should
supplement Citri-Thin.

Federalism:
Maine goes it alone
against debt collectors


Well before the GOP-dominated Congress decided to give more power to the
states, the state of Maine decided it would seek a little power on its own.
In 1994 Maine asked to be exempt from the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
(FDCPA).  The FTC granted that request just before the new year.

The FDCPA, passed in 1978, has always allowed states the option of
independently regulating debt collectors.  In theory, the Act is a minimum
safety net -- states are allowed to pass stricter regulations, but their
regulations must be at least as strict as those outlined in the FDCPA if they
hope to be exempt from the Act.

The FTC has now ruled unanimously that Maine's laws protect consumers at least
as well as the FDCPA.  In some instances, the agency noted, the state offers
better protection.  For instance, Maine has a staff in its Bureau of Consumer
Credit Protection (BCCP) dedicated to protecting the state's consumers from
unfair debt collection practices.  The staff can pursue leads and bring
actions the federal government does not have the manpower to pursue.  And
because Maine takes a "hands-on" enforcement approach, unfair practices can be
stopped quicker, the FTC said, before much damage is done.

Civil penalties are lower under Maine's law than under the FDCPA.  But that
State has an enforcement tool the federal government does not -- revocation of
a debt collector's license.  Maine's "strengths more than offset the
weaknesses," the FTC said.  And Maine consumers may still privately sue debt
collectors under the FDCPA.

Maine is required to file a report with the FTC every two years to keep the
Commission apprised of its activities.  The FTC solicited public comments on
the State's proposal in May, 1994.  [FTC:WATCH No.  413, May 23, 1994]

Top 10 Scams:
Somethings old, nothing new


The names change and one scam may be more popular one year than the next, but
con artists continued to rely on all the old tricks last year.  As the
Telemarketing Sales Rule took effect to ring in the new year, the FTC staff
compiled its list of top 10 scams of 1995.  If this sounds familiar, it is:

1. Sweepstakes - You have not won $25,000.
2. Travel Scams - Impossible-to-meet restrictions apply.
3. Gemstones - Absolutely worthless! How much would you pay?
4. Recovery Rooms - Sorry you lost money. Want to lose some more?
5. Business Opportunities - Vending machines + a little spare time = 
disappointment.
6. Charitable Solicitations - Sometimes, a small portion of your 
contribution actually goes to a charity, but not often.
7. Advance Fee Loans - Money down for empty promises.
8. Toner Rooms - Overpriced office supplies are our specialty.
9. Work at Home Plans - Make Christmas ornaments at home; earn millions.
10. Credit Repair - Able to fix only what's not really broken.

RIP: Six more rules deep sixed


Being a consumer in the 1960s was tough.  The lucky ones dodged the
potentially fatal effects of inhaling quick-freeze aerosol glass frosting
spray and steered clear of nasty itching fits from fiberglass curtains.  But
still they were liable to succumb to shady salesman looking to make a fast
buck on non-prismatic binoculars, too-tiny sleeping bags and tablecloths, and
extension ladders that didn't quite do the job.

The FTC made some rules to stop all that.  All that stopped.  Now, those rules
have gone the way of disco, and not a decade too soon.  By repealing six more
rules, the Commission has now killed seven rules and eight guides.

* The Quick Freeze Spray Rule (1969-1995) required manufacturers of aerosol
spray products used for frosting beverage glasses to warn consumers that
inhaling the product could be fatal.  The product left the market in 1982,
according to the FTC staff, ushered out by that bastion of good taste, Ronco,
Inc., marketer of the Popiel Pocket Fisherman.  No product, no rule, the
Commission said in repealing the rule.

* The Fiberglass Curtain Rule (1967-1995) was likewise unnecessary, since
fiberglass curtains are no longer sold for consumer use.  They were popular in
the 1960s because they were fire retardent.  They were also, well, fiberglass,
which says "itchy" to anyone who knows the material.  But technology has
evolved and many fire-retardent fabrics that do not cause skin irritation have
replaced fiberglass fabrics.  No product, no rule.

* The Binocular Rule (1964-1995) required marketers of non-prismatic
binoculars to say that their product was non-prismatic.  Technology has driven
the price of prisms down since the rule was promulgated, and nearly all
binoculars today use prisms.  Those that don't -- opera and field glasses, for
instance -- are clearly marketed in a category separate from binoculars, the
FTC staff reasoned.  No product, no rule.

* The Sleeping Bag Rule (1963-1995) and the Tablecloth Rule (1964-1995) both
governed the measurements manufacturers could use when advertising, labeling
and marking their products.  The National Conference on Weight and Measures'
Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation, adopted by 47 states, now governs
the very same thing, for sleeping bags, tablecloths, etc.  State rules in, fed
rules out, said the FTC.

* Finally, the Extension Ladder Rule (1969-1995) set out rules for labeling
extension ladders.  Surprised?  American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
standard A14 does the same.  Industry standard in, fed rule out.

The FTC's review of old rules continues.  The initiative was started well
before President William Jefferson Clinton and his sidekick, Albert Gore, Jr.,
decided to reinvent government, but they're not complaining about "overzealous
deregulation" at the FTC, either.

Viaticals: Advice on how you can 
take it with you before you go


Terminally ill patients are increasingly cashing in their life insurance
policies and enjoying (or at least using) the money while they can.  The
viatical business is booming and the FTC is now offering a brochure to keep
the dying from going bust.

For the families of the terminally ill, instant cash for a life insurance
policy may seem like money from heaven.  "But viatical arrangements are
complicated, and must be approached cautiously and with great care," said FTC
Consumer Protection Bureau Director Jodie Bernstein.

A new FTC brochure, "Viatical Settlements:  A Guide for People with Terminal
Illnesses," explains the legal, financial and tax consequences of viatical
settlements.  Copies are available through the FTC's Public Reference Branch,
202/326-2222.

"Made in U.S.A." Workshop
scheduled for late March;
consumers reacting


Judging from the latest consumer comments to hit the public record in the
FTC's search for a "Made in the U.S.A."  advertising and labeling standard,
the Commission's old standard is still the best standard.

The FTC has historically required unqualified Made in the U.S.A.  claims to be
backed by a product made entirely, or virtually entirely, in the United
States.  Manufacturers, citing the increasingly global marketplace, have
argued that few products can nowadays meet such a stringent standard.

Consumers, however, have asked the FTC to maintain that high standard for
unqualified claims.  "If 75% of the product was made in the USA and 25% was
made in China, then state that on the label," says one commenter.  More
gruffly, another expressed the same sentiment:  "If a shoe is 20% foreign +
80% [Made in the] USA, say so -- we can handle it."

The Alabama Textile Manufacturers Association, Inc.  agreed.  "The consumer is
entitled to know where a product is manufactured.  We believe any attempt to
'fuzzy' that information is wrong," the association said in urging the FTC to
retain is standard.

The Commission will grapple with "Made in the U.S.A."  advertising and
labeling issues at a public workshop to be held March 26, 27 and possibly even
28, 1996, depending "on the number of issues raised."  Requests to participate
in the conference are due by January 16.

Commissioner Roscoe B.  Starek III dissented without comment on the 4-1
Commission decision to schedule the workshop.  Starek has consistently
resisted efforts to take "Made in the U.S.A."  claims out of the case log and
into the public policy arena.

Arizona therapist network
unlikely to cause problems


An Arizona network of physical, occupational and speech therapists is unlikely
to run afoul of the antitrust laws, according to the FTC staff.  In a December
7, 1995 letter to an attorney representing the proposed Southern Arizona
Therapy Network, Inc.  (SATNET), the FTC gave a clean bill of health to the
venture which, among other things, will rely on a messenger model when
collecting fee information and reporting that information to its members.

Under the messenger model, SATNET will act merely as a messenger of fee
information, collecting it from third-party payers and reporting that
information to its members without recommendation.  The FTC/DOJ Health Care
Statements set out a safety zone for messenger model ventures that leave up to
the venture's individual members decisions on whether to accept or reject
reimbursement levels.

SATNET's plans to collect non-fee information also fall within the safety
zones in the policy statements, the FTC staff said.  And potential future
plans for SATNET to coordinate the setting of capitation rates for its members
is unlikely to cause problems because of the low number of therapists
participating in the plan.  Only 13% of physical therapists in the area, 6% of
occupational therapists and 1% of speech therapists have signed on.

Antitrust immunity raises
international shipping rates?


Collusion is illegal in most industries, but not in the international shipping
industry.  In fact, collusion is actually encouraged in the shipping industry,
and that may lead to higher rates with few offsetting benefits, according to a
new government report.

Paul S.  Clyde of the DOJ's Antitrust Division and James D.  Reitzes, formerly
of the FTC's Economics Bureau, argue that the use of shipping conferences to
set prices for international shipping leads to higher rates when the market
share of the conference participants is high.  The Shipping Act of 1984,
overseen by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), grants antitrust immunity
to these conferences, which have existed since the 19th century.  While the
conferences do not act as perfect cartels, they don't promote perfect
competition either, say Clyde and Reitzes in their December, 1995 report, "The
Effectiveness of Collusion Under Antitrust Immunity:  The Case of Liner
Shipping Conferences."

Conference participants must submit rates to the FMC for review and approval.
The FMC is charged with assuring the rates are neither too high nor too low.
In some conferences, shippers are legally allowed to discount the fees they
file.  But in many others, discounting is deemed rebating, a practice that the
FMC condemns.  Between 1985 and 1989, the FMC assessed more than $12 million
in penalties for rebating, the report states, essentially charging companies
with the egregious practice of competing on price.

The evidence "indicates that conferences do not act as perfect cartels
maximizing the joint profits of their members," according to the report.
"Nonetheless, we find that the level of freight rates is significantly lower
on routes where conference members are free to negotiate service contracts
directly with shippers."

The authors note that higher prices were found "on routes where the
conference's market share is relatively high (over 80%)."  There may be
efficiencies that spring from conferences.  But "even if collective pricing is
required to encourage efficiency-enhancing investment, the associated
anticompetitive harm may still outweigh the efficiency benefits."

Care Labeling, Take Two


In November, the Commission asked whether its proposal to allow symbols in
lieu of words on garment care labels was a good idea.  While pondering that
question (until the comment deadline of January 31), consider these other Care
Labeling Rule teasers:

* Should the mention of new technologies, such as "professional wet cleaning,"
be allowed on care labels?

* If a garment can be washed or dry-cleaned, should manufacturers be required
to let consumers know how to wash the product at home?  The rule now allows
such garments to be labeled with the words "dry clean," though they may not
bear the tag "dry clean only."

* Should the FTC clarify what constitutes a "reasonable basis" for care
instructions?

* Should the definition of water temperatures be changed to reflect current
washing machine settings?

Proposed answers to those questions will be accepted until March 12 as the
FTC's review of the Care Labeling Rule continues.  The FTC proposed allowing
"care symbols" on garment tags last November in furtherance of the goals of
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  [FTC:WATCH No.  445,
November 20] The FTC staff reasoned that symbols cross borders between the
U.S., Canada and Mexico better than words.  ?Comprende?

Dead Animals (I):  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has

Dead Animals (I):  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has
weighed in on the FTC's review of its Guides for Select Leather and Imitation
Leather Products.  PETA, a combative animal rights group, has proposed
"ordering" manufacturers to come up with simpler labels for leather and
nonleather goods.  The group recommends that all leather products be labeled
"Animals Suffered to Make This Product."  Any non-leather good could be
labeled a "Cruelty-free Product."  In this respect, PETA differs from the
National Consumers League (NCL), which has asked the FTC to examine the use of
general claims such as "cruelty-free."  NCL believes such claims are fuzzy.

Dead Animals (II):  Leather Industries of America, Inc.  has asked the
Commission to set a minimum leather content standard -- 75% -- for products
labeled as "bonded leather."  Bonded leather is leather and non-leather bonded
together to make a consumer product.  The FTC's Leather Guides currently allow
use of the term bonded leather even if only 1% of a product is leather,
according to Leather Industries President Charles S.  Myers.

Stephen F.  Quill, President of Ecological Fibers, Inc.  suggests calling
products with a low leather content "reinforced bonded leather."  Quill's firm
makes book bindings that contain 20% leather.  That's not 100% leather, but
"we certainly believe that if you add the word 'reinforced' anyone would know
that it is not directly from the cow," Quill told the FTC.

Sunsetting:  Got an FTC administrative order more than 20 years old?  No you
don't.  Orders now automatically sunset on their 20th birthday.  January 2
marked the mass sunset of old orders under the Commission's new automatic
sunset policy.  Oly oly in free.

Trustees wanted:  The FTC is looking for a few good individuals or "other
entities" to serve as trustees, here's your big chance.  Send your name,
experience and areas of expertise to:  Daniel P.  Ducore, Assistant Director,
Compliance Division, Bureau of Competition, Federal Trade Commission, Suite
2115, 601 Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Global Competition Hearings:  Hurry!  January 26 is the deadline for written
comments to be added to the record of the FTC's Global Competition.  [FAXLine

Mobile Radio:  A federal district court judge has granted the FTC's request
for a preliminary injunction barring Falcon Crest Communications from using
false claims when selling brokerage services to consumers who hold federal
paging and mobile radio licenses.  The licenses themselves were often the
not-so-valuable fruit of a previous investment scam, according to the FTC.
Falcon Crest offered to find high-paying buyers for those licenses, a feat it
was unlikely to accomplish, the FTC charged.  The PI bars false claims and
freezes the assets of Falcon, its parent company, Republic Communications
Corp., and company officers and salesmen Joel H.  Cohen, Jordan Drew, Gary
Perry and Nicholas Vasti.  [FTC Press Release, December 27; Contact:  Stephen

Recovery room telemarketer
must get $250,000 bond backing

The FTC accused Sherri L.  Pollock last January of participating in a scheme
that combined two of the hottest cons on the telemarketing circuit:  the
recovery room and telefunding.  Pollock last month agreed to post a $250,000
surety bond before conducting telemarketing in the future as part of a
settlement of those charges.  Pollock is the last defendant to settle in the
FTC's case against PFR, Inc.

When soliciting charitable donations or payments for prizes or awards, Pollock
agreed not to falsely represent any material facts.  Pollock further agreed to
avoid false representations when telemarketing any good or service.  She will
monitor her employees to make sure they avoid misrepresentations as well,
under the terms of a stipulated final judgment filed in federal court last
month.

The U.S.  Attorney's Office in Las Vegas, the Las Vegas office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the Nevada Attorney General's Telemarketing Unit
assisted the FTC with its case against PFR.  The case was jointly handled by
the FTC's Division of Service Industry Practices and the FTC's San Francisco
Regional Office.

Indictment filed in
job promotion case


The U.S.  Attorney's Office has charged Debra Mink, sole proprietor of an
allegedly bogus job placement service operated under the name International
Services, with 45 counts of wire and mail fraud.  Ads for International
Services allegedly implied the company knew of available jobs, had ties to
Fortune 1000 companies and had an 80% placement rate, none of which was true.

The suit could land Mink in a federal penitentiary for several years if
successful, based on current Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  But first, the
government must find her.  Mink disappeared during the FTC's civil case
against her.  There is a warrant out for her arrest and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) is involved in the search.

By accepting orders for her allegedly bogus service over the phone, Mink
committed wire fraud, according to the indictment.  Ang sending checks through
the mail or by Federal Express to pay for ads placed in newspapers across the
country qualifies as mail fraud, the indictment states.

Though ads promised significant job placement assistance, Mink's business
consisted mainly of resume preparation, according to the indictment.

Last September a federal district court judge ordered Mink to pay a
$593,206.27 judgment, the amount the court determined had been taken in the
scheme.

Calorie claims don't add up
for Mama Tish's ice cups, agency alleges


Representations for Mama Tish's Italian Specialties ice cups get a chilly
reception from the FTC.  Ads praised the benefits of Mama Tish's ice cups,
notably that they are "naturally low in calories."  But of the company's ten
regular flavors and two Nutrasweet-sweetened flavors of ice cups, none
qualified as low in calories, the FTC charged.

The Food and Drug Administration, in rules promulgated under the Nutrition
Labeling and Education Act (NLEA), defines a low calorie food as one having 40
or fewer calories per serving.  Mama Tish's regular flavor ice cups contained
between 104 and 145 calories per serving, according to the FTC, and the two
flavors sweetened with Nutrasweet contained 60 calories per serving.

Mama Tish's has agreed not to misrepresent the amount of calories or "any
other nutrient or ingredient" in any frozen dessert products.  A safe harbor
in the proposed consent order against Mama Tish's would allow any claims
permitted under FDA regulations promulgated under the NLEA.

The case was handled by the FTC's Chicago Regional Office.

"Project Telesweep" cleans up again


A telephone vending machine seller has agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty
and hang up some of his alleged sales practices.  Fitzgerald Lewis, president
of Quartercall Communications, Inc., was charged in July with failing to
provide his customers with disclosure documents required by the Franchise Rule
when selling telephone vending machine business opportunities.  Charges
against Lewis stemmed from "Project Telesweep," an enormous federal/state
crackdown of business opportunity fraud.

Budding entrepreneurs bought telephone vending machines from Lewis hoping to
install them in some public location where they would bring in rates of a
quarter a minute.  Lewis made claims of specific earnings, according to the
FTC.  But Lewis neither backed those earnings claims in writing, nor provided
his customers with the required disclosure documents, the FTC charged.

In addition to the civil penalty, Lewis has agreed not to violate the
Franchise Rule.  He will not misrepresent material facts when selling any
franchise or business opportunity in the future, under the terms of a proposed
consent order filed in federal court.

Training program part of
Funeral Rule settlement


A.H.  Peters Funeral Home of posh Grosse Pointe (Michigan) allegedly failed to
provide its customers with a number of price lists as the FTC's Funeral Home
Services Rule requires.  A.H.  Peters also conditioned the sale of some goods
on the purchase of other goods, the FTC charged, a no-no under the Rule.
What's the funeral home to do?

For starters, A.H.  Peters and its officers, Roy A.  Peters and David L.
Peters, have agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty.  To make sure they won't
make the same alleged mistake twice, they have agreed to institute a training
program for the funeral home's employees to guarantee compliance with the
Rule.

According to the FTC, the suburban Detroit funeral home failed to give its
customers a general price list as the Rule requires.  Same goes for the casket
price list.  And the outer burial price list.  And an itemized written
statement of goods and services selected.

A.H.  Peters has agreed not to violate the Rule in the future.

Columbia/HCA's oops


Read the fine print.  That's the lesson for Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corporation lawyers, who have asked the Commission to remove a commercial
lease from the company's divestiture requirements.  The fact that the lease
was slated to be divested at all is a "minor mistake," Columbia/HCA attorneys
argue.

Columbia/HCA has asked that the lease for office space used by Infusamed, an
infusion services company, be removed from a hold separate requirement and
promises to file a second request shortly asking that the lease be removed
from the company's divestiture requirements.

Columbia/HCA is required to divest properties in several areas of the country
to settle antitrust charges arising from its acquisition of Healthtrust, Inc.
One of those areas is Salt Lake City, Utah, where Columbia/HCA has agreed to
divest a package of assets referred to as the "Utah Healthtrust Assets."  The
lease got lumped in with that package mistakenly, according to Columbia/HCA.

The public will have 10 days -- not the usual 30 -- to comment on
Columbia/HCA's proposed change.

GM order changed


General Motors has convinced the Federal Trade Commissioners to soften a 1979
order that bars the car maker from placing the name of a car division on an
engine label unless the car division also manufactured the engine (i.e., no
fair identifying Oldsmobiles as having "Rocket 88" engines when the engines
were built by, say, the Chevrolet Division and installed in Chevy's as well).

GM's corporate restructurings since 1979 have resulted in the removal of
engine production from the nameplate divisions that existed then.  This
automotive alchemy constitutes changed conditions of fact, determined the
Commission, allowing it to reopen and modify the order.  Under the modified
order in C-2966, GM can display brand nameplates on engines that are
materially different from those displaying all other brand nameplates, and
cannot display different brand nameplates on identical engines.

Remembering Phil Areeda
by Robert Pitofsky


(Phillip Areeda died at the age of 65 Sunday, December 24.  1995)

With the death of Phil Areeda last month, the academic community has lost a
towering figure.  Those of us who teach law and try to engage in scholarship
know better than most that, without him, the world is a lesser place.

Much of Phil Areeda's public life was committed to antitrust scholarship and
his teaching at Harvard Law School.  I once mentioned to Phil that his
treatise was the longest in the history of Western thought not written in
German.  He enjoyed the description.  At the time he was still working on
volume six or seven, and his response was:  "you have no idea".  At his death,
he was working on volume eleven (and anxious that there would not be time
enough to complete the task) and planning volume twelve.

The treatise --unique in legal scholarship in its ambition and scope -- was
begun jointly with Donald Turner and completed with the help of Herb
Hovenkamp.

When work on this treatise started, antitrust was a jumble of conflicting
ideologies, irreconcilable cases and some diffuse and half--baked ideas.  The
goal of the authors was nothing less than to bring some order out of that
chaos and they succeeded admirably.  It is amazing the way sections of the
treatise migrated directly to Court of Appeals and Supreme Court decisions and
established the standard for competitive behavior.

Other aspects of Phil Areeda's scholarship were special.  He was endlessly
careful and meticulous -- some scholars would conclude after two or three
drafts,that they were "close enough" to being right and move on.  Phil never
quit reworking a subject until he was fully-satisfied.  There is also a
quality of "fairness" in his work -- to scholars with whom he might disagree,
to legislative intent, to prior judicial opinions -- that is all too rare in
scholarship.  It often appeared that Phil was at greater pains in stating
fairly the position of adversaries than in elaborating his own views.  He
always tried to give judicial decisions the benefit of a best rather than a
worst interpretation.  Even when he disagreed, he did so with respect and
without rancor.  Finally, Phil was comfortable with ideology but practical as
well.  He recognized that people and courts are fallible, and that life is not
invariably rational, and his interpretations and conclusions reflect that
understanding.

Much of the history of antitrust development in recent decades involves the
integration of economics into antitrust analysis.  Phil Areeda (along with Don
Turner) were among the very best in bringing economic analysis to bear without
allowing it to become overly technical or impractical.  It is common now for
legal briefs and scholarly analysis in the antitrust field to cite and discuss
economic insights as well as legal precedent.  That was not true (or at least
not as true) before Phil helped reshape the field.

While most people are aware of Phil's work through the treatise, his principal
commitment may have been as a teacher at the Harvard Law School.  He was
exceptionally popular in the classroom and invariably respected.  Some have
described his teaching (heavy with the traditional Socratic method) as
orthodox and even "old-fashioned.  That is a fair description if
"old--fashioned" means that he was rigorous in class, well organized, and
constantly courteous to his students.  Unlike the current style in some
quarters, Phil in the classroom was not there to inculcate students with his
personal views of the world, but rather to teach a subject.  He brought to the
classroom a sense that he thought his subject was interesting and important,
and an infectious enthusiasm that never waned.

Somewhere along the way, Phil developed a discriminating taste for good food,
good wine, good books and opera.  His wine cellar was the most extraordinary
private collection I have seen.  Occasionally we would have lunch or dinner at
excellent places like Lutece, the famous French restaurant in New York.  Phil
was a connoisseur and knew the best from second-best, but once the meal
started, he never discussed the food or the wine -- he enjoyed them and
discussed other interesting things.

Through his teaching, Phil influenced the attitudes and careers of thousands
of Harvard students.  The Areeda Turner Treatise and his other scholarship
were the most important and constructive influences on antitrust policy in a
generation.  Scores of scholars around the country can testify to his
generosity in offering advice, ideas, even inspiration.  Shortly before his
death, Phil said "my life has been teaching and writing."  It was a life well
lived.

MONITOR UTILITY COMPANIES THROUGH STATE REGULATORS

Electric power companies, natural gas providers, pipelines, and other 
public utilities are highly regulated at the state level.  They all 
file reams of valuable information with their respective states' 
Public Utility Commissions or equivalent regulatory authorities.
 
Much of this material is readily available to the business 
researcher.  Current and recent historical information such as plant 
locations and facilities, fuel consumption, sales, smokestack 
emissions and other pollution data are yours for the asking.  So to 
is valuable information on future plans such as expansions, major 
equipment purchases, land acquisitions, and much more.
 
Regulatory filings are generally the first items to go after.  These 
are normally provided promptly on request.  But don't overlook the 
rich source of material provided in conjunction with Public Utility 
Commission hearings, feasibility studies, and the like.  Unless you 
know of a specific item's availability, locating these collections of 
in-depth testimonies, exhibits, and studies will likely require a 
visit by you, a staff member, or a hired researcher.  Call the 
applicable Public Utility Commission for the location of its document 
facility, visit it, and pore through the file cabinets and binders 
for valuable intelligence.

U.S. APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS LANDMARK VERDICT IN TOBACCO TRIAL

The Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a precedent-
setting jury verdict in a product liability suit against tobacco
manufacturers, setting aside the $400,000 award and sending the case
back because of errors it found in conduct of the trial.

The 87-page verdict opened some new avenues of argument
for plaintiff's attorneys and reinstated two tobacco companies as
defendants. But its temporary effect, at least, was to maintain the
industry's unbroken string of victories in product liability suits
brought by smokers and their families.

The verdict was returned in 1988 in a suit by Antonio Cipollone,
widower of Rose Cipollone, who died of cancer in 1984 at the age of
58 after more than four decades of smoking.

Like the trial judge, the appeals court accepted a distinction
between tobacco companies' liability before and after 1966, when the
government began requiring warnings of health hazards on packs. But
interpretations differed on several points.

At the trial, only the Liggett Group Inc. was found liable because
before 1966 Rose Cipollone smoked only one of its brands. Phillip
Morris Inc. and Lorillard Inc. were dismissed as defendants because
she smoked their cigarettes after that period.

And the jury returned a verdict only for Antonio Cipollone, not
Rose's estate, because it found her principally responsible for her
own injury.

The appellate court overturned U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin on
both counts.

Elements of the Third Circuit's decision:

* To prevail on the theory known as express warranty, plaintiffs'
attorneys must prove not only that tobacco companies ran pre-1966
advertisements implying that smoking wasn't harmful but also that the
plaintiff relied on those representations.

Rose Cipollone's reliance on the ads cannot be presumed but must be
proved, the court said, and Liggett's lawyers should have the chance
to prove that Rose Cipollone either was unaware of the ads or didn't
believe their message.

"The advertising constituted an express warranty...as long as Mr.
Cipollone can prove that Mrs. Cipollone was aware of the
advertisements and as long as Liggett does not prove that she
disbelieved them," the appellate court ruled.

Sarokin had ruled that it was enough to show that the commercials
were in public use, and it was this ruling upon which the $400,000
award to Antonio Cipollone was based.

* New Jersey's comparative fault law mitigating the manufacturers'
liability for failure to warn should be applied only to the period
before 1966.

The jury found Rose Cipollone was 80 percent responsible for
continuing to smoke and Liggett 20 percent responsible for failing to
warn her of the dangers, so her estate received no award.

But the appeals court ruled that the question of her responsibility
for her actions applied only to the period before warning labels were
required, rather than to her entire life.

"The jury should have been instructed that Mrs. Cipollone's post-1965
conduct bore only on the apportionment of damages, but not on her
comparative fault for her own injuries," the court said.

* The doctrine of inherent characteristics, which holds that
manufacturers cannot be sued if the product's defects are both
inherent and well known, applies only to the period after 1966.

For alleged injuries occurring before that period, a jury can decide
the facts on whether the average person can be expected to know about
the dangers of smoking and, if not, whether a company should be held
liable for defects of a product because its risks outweighed its
benefits.

Sarokin had ruled that the doctrine applied to the years before 1966
and thus barred recovery from Liggett for health effects due to the
design of the cigarettes.

The appeals court rejected Liggett's claim there was insufficient
evidence to prove that smoking the company's cigarettes caused the
cancer.

"The jury could have reasonably concluded...that Mrs. Cipollone's
smoking from 1952 to 1966...caused her lung cancer," the court said.

Both plaintiffs' and defense attorneys claimed victory.

"We repeatedly stated that the verdict was wrong and would be
reversed on appeal," said Liggett General Counsel Josiah Murray.

Plaintiffs' attorney Cynthia Walters expressed pleasure in the
decision, even though it overturned the $400,000 award.

"From our standpoint, we won beyond dispute on two areas of great
concern," she said.

U.S. JUDGE RULES OUT PUNITIVE DAMAGES FOR FLIGHT 103 VICTIMS

U.S. District Judge Thomas J. Platt of New York ruled
Jan. 3 that an international agreement bars families of victims of
the 1988 bombing of Pan American Flight 103 from suing the airline
for punitive damages.

The ruling "adds insult to injury in today's world," Platt said, but
the Warsaw Convention covering international flights limits relief to
compensatory damages.

He said "it is simply not within this court's power to construe the
treaty in a manner inconsistent with the contracting parties'
expectations."

Central to the plaintiffs' case is a charge that Pan Am received a
warning of a bomb threat but neither increased security adequately
nor notified passengers of the risk.

Many of the 259 victims on the plane were American college students
studying abroad who were returning home for the Christmas vacation.

Flight 103, en route from Germany to the United States, blew up over
Lockerbie, Scotland, apparently as the result of a terrorist bomb.

Suits brought by families across the country have been consolidated
into one proceeding in the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn.

Of more than 150 plaintiffs involved, 95 are represented by the New
York law firm of Kreindler & Kreindler, which specializes in aviation
litigation.

The firm's Lee Kreindler indicated there will be an appeal of Judge
Platt's ruling.

"I don't think this is the last word on it," he said.

The Warsaw Convention limits compensatory damages to $75,000 unless
willful misconduct is proven. It doesn't explicitly address punitive
damages, but Platt said the ban is implicit.

"While the Warsaw Convention does not expressly refer to punitive
damage claims, it appears that the Warsaw Convention bars such claims
whether or not willful misconduct exists," he said.

He said those who drew up the treaty in 1929 had a "shared
expectation" of setting "some uniform limit on an airline carrier's
liability in order to promote the civil aviation industry which at
the time of the Warsaw Convention was in its infancy."

"I think the judge was eminently correct in his decision," said James
M. Shaughnessy, a lawyer for Pan Am.

He added that he is not worried about an appeal.

Pan Am argues that it was prohibited by the U.S. government from
notifying passengers of the bomb threat.

The ruling in New York doesn't affect a case being brought against
Pan Am in the Florida courts by families of British passengers and
the 11 persons who were killed on the ground when the jet crashed in
Lockerbie.

"This group specifically chose to pursue our cases through the
Florida courts since it was felt that there would be a better change
of establishing punitive damages through the Florida courts than in
New York," spokesman Peter Watson said in London.

TAIWAN GOVERNMENT HELD LIABLE IN JOURNALIST'S SLAYING

The government of Taiwan can be held liable for its role in the
California slaying of a journalist and critic of the regime, the
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Dec. 29.

Henry Liu was shot and killed in Daly City, Calif., on orders of Vice
Adm. Wong Hsi-ling, then director of Taiwan's Defense Intelligence
Bureau. But Taiwan claimed Wong was acting outside his official
duties and had a personal grudge against Liu.

Several of those involved in the scheme, including Wong, were
convicted of murder in Taiwan, and one was convicted in California.

Liu's wife, Helen, filed a wrongful death action against the
government of Taiwan.

Overturning a lower court, the Ninth Circuit said she could proceed.

"Wong's act of ordering the assassination of Henry Liu was not wholly
personal but arose from his employment as director of the DIB," the
appellate panel said.

"When an employee, such as Wong, uses governmental authority in a
mistaken attempt to benefit his employer by silencing an outspoken
critic of the government, there is nothing inequitable about
spreading the loss among all the beneficiaries of the government."

Judge Robert Boochever also wrote that holding Taiwan accountable
wouldn't interfere with formation of foreign policy by the executive
branch of the U.S. government.

John Martel, an attorney for Taiwan, said he would review the
decision and consider an apepal.

He said the government of Taiwan "was as appalled as anyone" by the
killing "and there is no proof that the government had anything to do
with it."

CALIFORNIA PUNITIVE DAMAGES UP SINCE 1987, TORT REFORMERS SAY

The average amount of punitive damages awarded by California juries
has risen by 178 percent since 1987 alone, according to a study by
the Association for California Tort Reform.

The average award for punitive damages in 1989 was
$3.01 million, up from $1.69 million in 1987, the group reported.

The study was based on a review of 1,846 jury verdicts reported by
Jury Verdicts Weekly.

It found 48 punitive damage awards of $1 million or more and 19
awards of $5 million or more.

At the same time, the number of awards is down, from 15.2 percent in
1987 to 9.3 percent in 1989.

Tort reformers say that's because of a change in the law and
increased willingness of defendants to settle.

Victor Schwartz of the Washington, D.C., law firm of Crowell &
Moring, a specialist in torts, noted that in 1987 California raised
its standard of proof for punitive damages from preponderance of the
evidence to clear and convincing evidence.

In addition, he said, "many punitive damage cases are being channeled
into settlement" because punitive damages "are constantly being used
as a threat by plaintiffs' lawyers, and many defendants prefer
settlement to the Russian roulette system of punitive damage
litigation."

The study's findings were presented last month to the California
Legislature's Joint Committee on Tort Liability.

"This study indicates that the threat of punitive damages is a real
and major concern for the business community of California," said
Frank Schubert, president of the Association for California Tort
Reform.

"When one out of ten jury verdicts is likely to result in a punitive
damage award averaging more than $3 million, it is not difficult to
understand why business leaders are leery of California's legal
climate.

"It is a major reason why California is slowly losing its competitive
edge to less litigious international competitors."

FLORIDA SUPREME COURT FINDS INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER SELF-DEFENSE

The Florida Supreme Court ruled Dec. 21 that a clause common to
homeowners' insurance policies bars coverage for policyholders who
injure assailants in their homes in self-defense.

State law authorizes individuals to use force in self-defense, the
court acknowledged, and self-defense is a "worthy" motive for causing
injury.

Self-defense is nevertheless an intentional act and thus excluded
from coverage under a clause barring claims for intentional acts, the
court held in a 5-2 decision.

The case arose from an incident in which Edward Marshall shot his ex-
wife's son after the younger man broke into the house. A jury said
Marshall acted negligently and awarded the son $575,000 in
compensatory and punitive damages.

State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., which wrote the policy, refused to
pay the claim.

The court's unsigned majority opinion said clauses excluding coverage
for intentional acts are non-negotiable elements of most homeowners'
liability policies.

Allowing coverage of intenational acts, even in self-defense, would
skew actuarial tables and encourage individuals to commit wrongful
acts, the court said.

"We will not rewrite a policy under these circumstances to provide
coverage where the clear language of the policy does not; nor will we
invoke public policy to override this otherwise valid contract," the
majority said.

Justices Parker Lee McDonald and Rosemary Barkett dissented, saying
they would side with courts in other states that ruled acts of self-
defense are not the sort of intentional acts that would be
consciously undertaken by a homeowner because he or she is aware of
insurance against liability.

"It would be ironic to exonerate an individual on the basis of self-
defense but deny him insurance coverage of the costs of defense; yet
allow insurance coverage to a person who negligently causes injury,"
McDonald wrote.

FLORIDA COMMISSIONER CHARGES LAWYERS WITH INSURANCE FRAUD

Nine persons including two lawyers have been charged with
racketeering in a scheme to defraud insurance companies with false
medical claims, Florida Insurance Commission Tom Gallagher charged
Dec. 22.

Those charged included Mark Marks, 64, head of a law firm with
offices in Miami, North Miami, Pompano Beach and Fort Lauderdale, and
his son Gary, 32.

Prosecutors charged that the pair arranged for medical tests from the
Center for Neurological Services in Fort Lauderdale and dictated both
what the test results and the bills for the service should be.

They said employees of the law firm were told to alter or conceal
clients' medical records to provide false information to insurance
companies.

Those who cooperated allegedly shared up to thousands of dollars from
a fee-sharing fund.

Gallagher called the operation "an outrageous example of a criminal
conspiracy" designed to "cheat insurance companies out of millions of
dollars."

"The insurance companies were the biggest target, but the people are
the real victims," he said.

"Every lost dollar in insurance gets passed on to the public in the
form of more expensive insurance premiums."

PENNSYLVANIA COURT HOLDS UNION ISN'T LIABLE FOR STRIKE VIOLENCE

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Jan. 3 that the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters isn't liable for damages over violence in a
1977 strike against Freeport Transport Co.

The court said liability of Teamsters Local 538 was clear, but said
evidence didn't prove the international union was involved.

The high court upheld the trial court's judgment of $51,753 in
compensatory damages against the local and the international but
struck down an award of $250,000 in punitive damages against the
international.

Testimony showed that the international union said strike-related
violence would end if amnesty were provided one striker, Jack
Robison. Dissenting Justice John Flaherty said that was enough to
prove union involvement but the majority disagreed.

Robison was later convicted on criminal charges stemming from strike
violence.

"The appearance of a representative of the international in an effort
to end a strike does not mean that the IBT approved or encouraged the
violence during the strike," the court said.

It said the Pennsylvania Labor Anti-Injunctrion Act requires "a
higher showing than the common law rules of agency to establish a
union's liability."

PENNSYLVANIA COURT BARS WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT OVER PREMATURE TRIPLETS

A three-judge panel of Pennsylvania Superior Court has upheld a lower
court's ruling that a wrongful-death suit cannot be filed in the case
of triplets who were born prematurely.

"In the absence of any expression of intent from the Legislature or
any analysis by our Supreme Court, we cannot decide that fetuses born
prior to attaining viability should now be accorded the same rights
that children who have attained viability have been accorded under
the Wrongful Death and Survival Acts," the court said.

Michael and Ann Hudak conceded that their triplets weren't viable
after their premature birth. But they alleged that a group of
Williamsport doctors was negligent in failing to provide proper
treatment to stop premature labor.

UTAH SUPREME COURT HOLDS CITY, COUNTY & STATE LIABLE FOR FLOODING

The Utah Supreme Court has ruled that the city and county of Salt
Lake and state of Utah can be sued over failure to maintain a
culvert, resulting in flood damage to several stores in 1983.

A district court judge had dismissed the case on grounds of
government immunity. But the state's highest court unanimously held
that the immunity applied to policy decisions, and failure to clean
the culvert was an operational decision that didn't necessarily
follow established policy.

The Legislature passed legislation later in 1983 extending government
immunity to flood control, but the Supreme Court ruled that it wasn't
retroactive.

WASHINGTON SUPREME COURT RULES INSURERS MUST PAY FOR WASTE CLEANUP

The Washington State Supreme Court ruled Jan. 4 that insurers for the
Boeing Co. and several other corporations must help their
policyholders pay for cleaning up hazardous waste.

The decision was the latest in a string of court disputes over
whether cleanup costs are "damages" as the term is used in standard
comprehensive general liability coverage.

In its 7-2 ruling, the Washington court said they were.

The suit arose over cleanup of a land owned by Western Processing in
Kent, Wash. A major site for hazardous industrial waste for many
years, it was put on the original Environmental Protection Agency
list for Superfund cleanup.

On one side are Boeing, which said it's spent $40 million on the
cleanup; Northwest Steel Rolling Mills, Inc.; RSR Corp.; John Fluke
Manufacturing Co., Inc., and Davis Walker Corp.

They were notified in 1983 that, as generators of waste at the site,
they were responsible for costs of cleaning it up. They agreed to do
so in a consent decree entered in 1987.

In turn, they sought indemnification from their insurers: Aetna
Casualty & Surety Co., Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., Granite State
Insurance Co., American Centennial Insurance Co. and Hartford
Accident & Indemnity Co.

The suit was filed in federal court, which certified the question of
insurance company liability under Washington law to the state Supreme
Court.

Writing for the court, Justice Fred Dore gave short shrift to
insurers' arguments that cleanup costs ordered by government aren't
damages.

"Response costs in response to actual releases of hazardous wastes"
are damages within the meaning of the insurance policies at issue, he
said.

"The reported decisions across the country, the lay dictionary, the
insurance dictionary, the failure of the insurance industry to write
down what it meant, each of these facts lay waste to insurers'
argument," Dore said.

But the majority said the term doesn't cover safety measures or other
preventive costs taken in advance of any damage to property.

Chief Justice Keith Callow wrote a dissent in which he said the
majority ruling "upsets settled rules of insurance construction,
violates controlling precedent, and contravenes public policy."

LAWYER ATTACKS IDEA OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL TRUST FUND

Legal Times published an opinion article in its Dec. 18-25 issue
attacking the proposal of Maurice Greenberg, president of American
International Group, for a National Environmental Trust Fund to pay
for cleaning high-priority hazardous waste sites.

"Greenberg's proposal, if enacted into law, would allow the insurance
industry to escape part or all of its massive contractual liablity to
private- and public-sector policyholders for environ-mental cleanup,"
Peter Kalis wrote in the legal news weekly published in Washington,
D.C.

Kalis is a partner in the Pittsburgh firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockart
who represents manufacturers in their disputes with insurers.

Greenberg's proposed fund would be financed by a tax on all
commercial and industrial property/casualty insurance policies, as
well as equivalent fees paid by self-insured corporations.

In suggesting it last March, he argued that most pollution of soil
and ground water "did not result from deliberate, conscious acts" but
is "the residue of progress." Because all U.S. society benefited, he
said, we have a common interest in cleaning up.

But Kalis argued that comprehensive general liability insurance "was
marketed (and purchased) as a wholesale external-ization of risk, and
one of the risks insured against was the possibility that the lgeal
system would change and casue policy-holders to incur new types of
liability for property damage and bodily injury...

"One must wonder about the constitutional consequences of
congressional nullification of the contractual entitlements of
thousands of policyholders in order to effect an anticipated bailout
of the insurance industry."

COURT REQUIRES LIST OWNER TO OFFER 'OPT-OUT'

Over the past decade, many large mailing houses have adopted
a voluntary "opt-out" policy, permitting persons on a
mailing list to have their names deleted before the list is
rented to other mailers.

Now, for the first time, "opt-out" has been imposed on a
mailer as a matter of law.

The order, from a federal bankruptcy judge in San Antonio,
Tex., arose in unique circumstances.  One of the remaining
assets of a company that filed for bankruptcy was its
mailing list.  The company, Shocking Gray Corp., published a
catalog for gay consumers, many of whom expected that their
names on the list would remain confidential.

At a court-supervised auction to sell off the customer list,
some vendors of sex-related products made bids.  Further,
there was no assurance that whatever company purchased the
list would keep it discreet.

One of the bidders at auction and the leading marketer of
gay products by mail, Sean Strub, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Ronald P. King that if the list fell into the wrong hands it
would deter many gay consumers from letting their names
become part of marketing lists.  He urged the court to order
the buyer to give everyone on the list an opportunity to get
off of it.

The lawyer for the bankrupt company argued that giving
persons on the list the opportunity to be removed would
diminish its value.  "My job is to generate as much cash as
possible," he said.  But the judge ordered the company with
the winning bid at auction, Tzabaco in Northern California,
to offer everybody on the list an opt-out option.  David
Dow, Tzabaco's president,  said that his company, which
sells clothing and furniture by catalog, would have done
this anyway, because it knows the sensitivity of its gay
clientele.  About 15,000 of the 200,000 persons on the list
(7.5 percent) exercised the option.

Lawyers for Shocking Gray said afterwards that this order
exceeded the judge's authority.  But, bankruptcy courts have
wide latitude in managing the disposition of a company's
assets, including attaching conditions to purchases.  95-
52856-RPK (W.D. Tex., U.S. Bankruptcy Ct., Nov. 14).

VARNEY OF TRADE COMMISSION TO THE FOREFRONT

Leadership on the privacy issue in Washington has been
handed around over the past two decades depending on which
persons in high places take an interest.

The Office of Consumer Affairs and the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration have had a
piece of it.  Now it seems to be the Federal Trade
Commission's turn, in the person of its commissioner,
Christine A. Varney.

Not only has the FTC stepped up its compliance activity in
regulating credit bureaus and telemarketing, it has begun a
"Privacy Initiative" involving other agencies of the federal
government and state consumer-protection offices "to begin
to incorporate [privacy] principles in our consumer
protection mission," according to Varney.  After a series of
hearings last fall, the FTC plans a public workshop  this
spring (for information contact Martha Landesberg, e-mail
mlandesberg(at)ftc.gov).

The Bureau of Consumer Protection has been assigned to
gather comments from consumers, businesses, and privacy
organizations.  At the same time, the FTC established a
World Wide Web on-line site (ftc.gov) "to facilitate
thoughtful electronic debate about the rules that should
apply in the use and dissemination of consumer information
on-line," according to Varney, who was chief counsel to
President Clinton's 1992 campaign then cabinet secretary
before being named an FTC commissioner in 1994.  "An
important goal of the FTC's Privacy Initiative is to avoid
cumbersome regulation by facilitating the development of a
set of voluntary principles to govern the use of consumer
information in on-line transactions," Varney told a privacy
conference last fall.  This echoes the mantra of President
Bush's Consumer Advisor, Bonnie Guiton, who proved that "the
bully pulpit" of a federal office can prod businesses even
in the absence of laws.

'BOSTON GROUP' HOLDS UP MEDICAL PRIVACY BILL

A band of medical privacy critics in Boston has succeeded in
stalling a Senate bill that they believe "undercuts the very
fabric of doctor-patient confidentiality."

The bill introduced last November with bipartisan, liberal
and conservative sponsors and the blessing of Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole seemed assured of quick passage
in the Senate.  In fact, the main sponsor of S 1360, Sen.
Bob Bennett, R-Utah, planned to rush it though the chamber
before Christmas, after a cursory day of hearings Nov. 14.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., had signed on
on as a sponsor in expectation that the American Civil
Liberties Union would endorse the bill.  Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., signed on assuming that the confidentiality bill was
endorsed by privacy advocates.

Janlori Goldman, a former ACLU staff member who as deputy
director of the industry-funded Center for Democracy and
Technology aided in the drafting and the industry response
to the bill, led Senate staff to believe that the
legislation was supported by privacy and patient
organizations.

But a tiny organization of patients and practitioners called
the Coalition for Patient Rights spotted weaknesses in the
proposal.  Its New England representative, Massachusetts
psychiatrist Denise Nagel, persuaded the ACLU affiliate in
Massachusetts to oppose the bill.  She activated a few
privacy advocates in Washington, notably James Love of the
Ralph Nader-founded Consumers Project on Technology and Marc
Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, who
oppose the current draft.

The ACLU in Boston demanded a showdown with its national
leadership and persuaded it to reverse its neutral or
favorable stance towards the bill.

Perhaps in response, Goldman's organization and the American
Health Information Management Association (a trade group of
hospital records administrators) organized weekly strategy
sessions in Washington beginning before Christmas and
extending into late February.  Nagel, Rotenberg, and Love
have been a part of these meetings.  At the same time, on
the first working day of the New Year in Boston, Nagel
convened an impressive coalition of medical confidentiality
advocates who are preparing an amended version of the
Bennett bill and a totally new substitute to offer Congress
by next month.

The attendees included Love, Rotenberg, PRIVACY JOURNAL
Publisher Robert Ellis Smith, and representatives of the
Health Law Institute in Boston, the national and local ACLU,
the Council for Responsible Genetics, and the American
Psychiatric Association.

In the meeting, CPR, CRG, and CPT were criticizing a bill
and strategy embraced by CDT.  One had to stay alert.

(Smith has been quoted by COMPUTERWORLD as saying, "The bill
has three or four weaknesses that, if cured, would make it a
net plus for consumers.  Right now, it's a net minus, but it
doesn't miss by much.")

The Boston group thinks that the bill accelerates the
computerization and linkage of patient data and that it
permits wide access to law enforcement and insurance
companies, as well as to employees within a medical
facility.  The Center for Democracy and Technology says that
the Bennett bill is the strongest medical privacy proposal
ever seriously considered by Congress.

The dispute has accentuated a growing schism among privacy
groups  in Washington and, in the process, has stalled
consideration of S 1360 and caused some Senate liberals to
reconsider their endorsement of the current language.

The bill creates a new nationwide right for patients to
inspect their own files and a framework for patients to
consent to a wide variety of disclosures.  The bill
generally gives approval to current disclosures of medical
data.  If medical providers comply with the new law they
would be immune from lawsuits by patients victimized by
disclosure of their medical information.  The bill would
pre-empt stronger state laws in eight states, California,
Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts,  Minnesota,
Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.

AUTOMATED MEDICAL FILES NOW LESS SECURE?

In 1994 52 percent of 355 hospital records managers
responding to a survey said that computerized records are
more secure than paper records.  In 1995, that percentage
slipped to 43 percent, the same number who think that manual
and automated records are about equally secure.  The Second

law firm of Gordon & Glickson, is available from Diana J.P.

INTERNET WIRETAP, A FIRST

For the first time, federal prosecutors have used a wiretap
order from a federal court to intercept messages on the
Internet.

The investigation resulted in the arrests Dec. 29 of a
German engineer living in Nevada, his estranged wife, and a
salesman for the German man.  They were charged with an
international conspiracy to sell illegal electronic
surveillance equipment.

In the past, federal authorities have monitored Internet
activities with the consent of participants.  Federal agents
are also able to get identities of Internet users and stored
messages with a subpoena, but intercepting ongoing messages
requires a court-approved warrant.  In this case, Secret
Service agents in New York City secured approval to tap the
German's electronic-mail activity on CompuServe.  They posed
as buyers, in six months of electronic communication with
the suspect, Bernhard Bowitz.

JFK, NIXON, AND NOW -

A writer for SPY magazine was assigned to get a job at the
tabloid newspapers to learn whether the reports of tawdry
gossip-gathering techniques were true.  In an article
published in the November/December issue, Stuart Goldman
reported that the practices were worse than he had imagined.

"The tabloids are, as I would experience first-hand, in the
business of smearing reputations and subverting the truth.
If the blatant fabrication of stories - and the lying,
backstabbing, bribery, blackmail, intimidation, mail theft,
wiretapping, leaking of disinformation, and computer hacking
used to get these stories - wasn't what I initially
expected, I quickly learned otherwise," Goldman wrote in a
shocking expose, after stints working for THE NATIONAL
ENQUIRER, THE STAR, THE GLOBE, and "A  Current Affair" in
Los Angeles.

Hollywood now has its long awaited opportunity for revenge
against the gossip press.  A new company named Phoenix
Pictures has purchased the rights to Goldman's nine-page
story and signed Oliver Stone, who directed "JFK" and
"Nixon," to direct.  Goldman plans to recount more of his
experiences in a forthcoming book, SNITCH: CONFESSIONS OF A
TABLOID SPY,  COMPUTER HACKER AND ALL AROUND SCOUNDREL.

SO MUCH FOR PRINCIPLES

Since the 1980s, the principle of "secondary use" has been
the crucial part of a code of fair information practices
endorsed by the federal government and by hundreds of
businesses.  The principle states that personal information
gathered for one purpose ought not be used for an
incompatible purpose without the consent of the individual.

"The principle," says the Washington spokesman for the
direct-marketing business, Richard A. Barton, "was raised to
the status of Holy Writ."

In the early 1990s, TRW Information Systems abandoned the
principle in its revised code of practices (although its
competitor, Equifax, continues to endorse the principle, in
a code of standards revised in 1993).

Now, Barton says that the principle probably doesn't apply
to the direct marketing industry of the 1990s.  "The
Internet and other interactive services have different
protocols and privacy expectations than traditional forms of
direct marketing," he writes in an essay in DM News (Dec.
25, 1995).  "We now enjoy a greater ability to collect,
store, and organized data than was imaginable just 18 years
ago.  As well, security problems on the Internet have
increased people's privacy concerns.  We must examine
privacy issues with a fresh perspective.  If we do not, we
may not have as great a success in molding the regulatory
environment as we have had in the past."

This revisionism comes when the DMA's most influential
member, Metromail, a direct-marketing firm, has been
criticized for violating the principle on secondary use, by
selling information traditionally used for marketing to law
enforcement, private investigators, and skip tracers.
Metromail has a call-in service whereby anyone, for $3 a
minute, may learn the telephone numbers, names, and ages of
all residents at a known address [see PJ Dec 95].  The
company, a subsidiary of R.H. Donnelley & Sons, said that it
has discontinued including children's names in its service.

BUSTING PARENTS: IT CAN HAPPEN HERE

In a story on the arrest of a famous TV anchor person in
London for having apparently taken innocent nude photographs
of her seven-year-old daughter [see PJ Dec 95], PRIVACY
JOURNAL asked "Can it happen here?"

On the very day that ITN newsreader Julia Somerville was
arrested in a drug store that developed the photos, a woman
was subjected to the same humiliation and fear in Cambridge,
Mass.

Both arrests occurred on Nov. 2.  The case of Toni Marie
Angeli came to light only late in December, perhaps because
she is not famous.

Angeli said that she took pictures of her four-year-old boy
for a class at Harvard, where she is a graduate student.
The photos show the boy nude inside their apartment and
outdoors; in some shots he is urinating.

A photo lab alerted Cambridge police to the photos, and
detectives showed up at the lab to confront the mother when
she picked up the photos.  An argument and scuffle ensued,
and she was arrested for assault and disorderly conduct.  No
charge was issued concerning the photos because there was no
"lascivious intent."

Police said that they wanted to satisfy themselves that the
photos were taken by a parent, without coercion to the
child.

Opinion seemed split in Boston whether the police had
overreacted or whether they were right in checking out all
suspicions of child abuse.  "There is a moral panic afoot in
the U.S. that has been accelerating in recent years," said
the Boston Coalition for Freedom of Expression.  "If there
is no direct evidence of sexual abuse in the pictures, then
that should have been enough."

MARYLAND MEDICAL DATA BASE; RECYCLED MEDICAL DATA

FROM MIRIAM L. AZRAEL, ATTORNEY, BALTIMORE, MD.:  Thank you
for including in last month's issue information about
Maryland's medical records data base.  The day after I
received my issue in the mail I received a call from a
Bethesda, Md., subscriber who somehow tracked me down for
more information.  The more Marylanders who get involved in
the process, the more accountable the state will be to
consumers who have legitimate concerns about their medical
records privacy.

FROM SAN DIEGO, CAL.:  Our organization received a complaint
from a person who received a letter from a hospital saying
that "an employee retrieved some computer generated medical
sheets from a recycling box to use as scratch paper at home.
 . . . A friend of our employee inappropriately used several
of these sheets as stationery.  You have been identified as
one who received correspondence from that person on the back
of these medical records and are, therefore, in possession
of this health care information."  The hospital then
cautioned the recipient not to violate California's medical
confidentiality law by disclosing the information and
insisted that the "stationery" be returned to the hospital
immediately.

[In addition to the breach] we are concerned that the
hospital now has in its possession the personal
correspondence list of the [non-employee] individual who
used recycled paper as stationery.

FROM TRUMANSBURG, N.Y.:  I wrote to MIB Inc. and asked for a
copy of my file.  They sent me the form, I filled it out
(they didn't ask for a SSN, amazingly), and they wrote back
and said that they had no file on me at all.  I don't
believe them - I had [individual health] insurance in effect
about three years earlier and the insurance company had
added stuff to my application which they presumably got from
MIB.  Do I have any recourse?

RESPONSE: At present you have to take a consumer reporting
agency's word when it says it has no file on you.  But if
you discover in the future that it did have information on
you, you can take action, based on a violation of the Fair
Credit Reporting Act.

It is not surprising that MIB does not have a file on you.
It has records on only about five percent of the U.S.
population, mainly for life insurance underwriting.  MIB,
located in Boston (617/426-3660), keeps computerized
summaries taken from prior insurance applications and then
provides them to another insurance company to which you
apply for coverage.  It is an example of a huge data base
that does not use Social Security numbers in its files.

FROM MT. HOPE, ARK.:  What kind of background checks on
patients do doctors and dentists do?  How can I get access
to this data base?

RESPONSE:  There are a few data bases that will tell a
doctor whether a person has filed a malpractice lawsuit in
the past.  These entities are subject to the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, which requires them to disclose to you what
information they have stored on you and requires the doctor
to identify the data base if you are turned down as a
patient because of information in them.  (There  is also a
federal data base listing doctors accused of malpractice and
other misconduct, although it is not available to the
general public.  There are a few private data bases that
sell similar information to the public.  They are not
subject to the FCRA.)

House Small Business Panel Finishes SBA Review

     With the House Small Business Committee's
initial review of all SBA programs complete, staffers
say the committee is starting to form its own
proposals to cut the agency.
     Everything is on the table and undecided,
committee sources say, but they are hoping to release
their proposal by mid-May. Other key players will
be the Budget Committee, which sets the
authorization for the agency, and the Appropriations
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and
Judiciary, which divvies up the funds. The House
Small Business Committee proposal will most likely
be the starting point for legislation.
     SBA recently made its own proposal, which
would eliminate the government's subsidy for the
small business loan programs, the agency's costliest
program, and consolidate local SBA offices and
centers. These changes would reduce the agency's
fiscal year 1996 budget by almost a third, providing
nearly double what the House committee proposed.
     But it is unlikely the House Small Business
Committee will stop there. Chair Jan Meyers, R-
Kan., has repeatedly said she believes the 8(a)
program is "duplicative" with the new SDB and
price preference program created as part of last year's
federal acquisition bill. The Small Business
Investment Program has also been pointed to as a
program that could be cut, possibly privatized.
     House aides indicated the committee is concerned
about SBA's proposal to reduce the government's
subsidy loan cost to zero through increases in fees to
banks and borrowers. Several members have
worried additional loan fees would put SBA loans
out of reach of smaller businesses.
     Members, including Meyers, also voiced
concerns about an SBA plan to close local SBA
offices, which might affect their districts. The
proposal would consolidate regional offices with
their district counterpart and eliminate many local
offices, leaving most states with just one SBA office.
Due to their concerns, committee members are
working closely with SBA officials on this matter.
     If Meyers' committee rejects or pares down these
two proposals, as it seems they might, it could mean
cuts may need to be found in other SBA programs,
though no one program will yield as much savings
as the loan program.
     SBA hopes it will have a champion in freshman
Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y. and a member of the
House Appropriations Subcommittee, which has
jurisdiction over SBA funding. Forbes is a former
director of congressional affairs for SBA and
regional administrator for the Northeast Region.
Staff aides say he is a strong advocate of the agency
as a whole.

Clinton Defends Preferences, Hopes to Diffuse Anger
President May Look at Helping Non-Minorities

     Republicans and Democrats may be looking for
ways to help broaden the base of programs for the
disadvantaged, but for very different purposes.
     Republicans hope to promote economic
disadvantage over race as a better way to help lift up
poor Americans than affirmative action. The Clinton
administration appears to be hoping to deflect anger
away from affirmative action, by looking for ways to
help non-minorities.
     In a speech to the California Democratic Party,
Clinton said Democrats should not retreat on those
affirmative action programs that work, but, rather,
should look to what we can do for those hurt by
downsizing and other structural changes in the
economy.
     It was the President's first indication he may take
the initiative on affirmative action. But other reports
have implied the administration's review may call for
additional review and the creation of a bipartisan
committee to study the matter further.
     If the administration lets conservatives take the
lead, it could result in the substitution of economic
for racial preferences. Clint Bolick of the Institute for
Justice, one of the think tanks behind the GOP attack
on affirmative action, has suggested the use of
economic disadvantage-based programs and
specifically targeted aid to help expand opportunities
for those in poor areas.
     For instance, he suggested the Small Business
Administration should narrow its focus to target only
those areas of the nation, namely inner cities, where
the barriers to small business success are highest.
     But a large-scale attempt to help the poor is
unlikely when the federal government faces a
massive deficit. At a panel discussion sponsored by
the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity,
Randall Kennedy of the Harvard Law School warned
that a move to replace economic for social
disadvantage would require more money and
possibly end up unfunded.
     Michael Dyson of the University of North
Carolina said that to truly help the poor masses
would require raising taxes on the rich and increasing
the minimum wage.
     He contended that affirmative action programs
actually cost very little and their elimination would
only help the poor if funds for affirmative action
were being diverted from anti-poverty programs.
     Affirmative action opponents' suggestion to
redirect these programs to target the poor specifically
seems particularly inconsistent when Congress is in
the process of cutting anti-poverty programs,
Kennedy said.
     Kennedy and Dyson were not completely
opposed to changes in affirmative action, particularly
when it came to the subject of whichgroups should
receive such preferences. Asked whether some
distinctions should be made between new immigrant
groups and those groups, such as African Americans
and Native Americans, who suffered historically at
the hands of this nation, Dyson said he was not as
interested in preserving programs in their current
state.
     But, he added, affirmative action should not be
thrown out just because "some of the beneficiaries
are suspect."

Washington Insider

     Federal officials, at first seemingly caught off-
guard by attacks on affirmative action, are now
strongly promoting it as a sign of good business
sense. At a recent conference, Postmaster General
Marvin Runyon, head of the U.S. Postal Service,
said that supplier diversity "is good for the nation
because it gives small, developing businesses a fair
chance. Organizations with strong minority supplier
programs say these small businesses are often able
to respond better and faster to their specific needs.
Encouraging supplier diversity encourages the best
from our country."
***
     But attacks on affirmative action programs on the
state level continue. According to The Los Angeles
Times, California Governor Pete Wilson is expected
to announce the elimination of all state affirmative
action programs not mandated by state law.
Although this will not affect California's major
affirmative action programs in education, hiring, and
contracting, it will mean abolishing several state
advisory boards and councils charged with
monitoring state compliance with those laws.
     Wilson, who also backs a ballot initiative
repealing all state and local affirmative action
programs, rejected diversity initiatives in his hiring
and judicial appointments. According to the Los
Angeles Times, his overall percentage of hires and
appointments of minorities have hovered around
17%, not coming near the percentage of minorities
comprising the state's labor force (39%) or its
population (43%).
***
     Some interesting facts regarding minority set-
asides and the 8(a) program...According to a recent
study done by the SBA Office of Advocacy, the six
largest federal prime contractors receive more
government contracts than do all small, minority-,
and women-owned federal contractors. And critics
say the 8(a) program is concentrated among a few
firms...Also SBA Administrator Phil Lader and his
Deputy Cassandra Pulley, at a recent hearing, cited
the fact that only 3% of the SBA's budget and 10%
of its personnel are devoted to running the 8(a)
program.
**
     For a hearing on a relatively obscure program, a
recent House government programs subcommittee
hearing on the Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) program was unusually well-attended, noted
subcommittee chairman Rep. Peter Torkildsen, R-
Mass. The surge in spectators was explained by the
presence of a dozen SBIR program managers,
wanting to see what subcommittee members were
going to do to their program.
***
     The Energy Dept. last month named Percy
McCraney as deputy director of the Office of
Economic Impact and Diversity in charge of the
Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business
Utilization (OSDBU). McCraney is an attorney and
former college business instructor originally from
Louisiana.
***
     Where was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., at the
recent Senate Small Business Committee hearing on
the 8(a) program? Kerry, who was the main sponsor
of the Senate 8(a) reform bill last year, did not even
make a quick appearance. The hearing set up at the
request of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole was
expected to question the whole existence of the
program, but Chairman Christopher Bond, R-Mo.,
seemed more bent on reform.
***
     The U.S. Agency for International Development
(AID) will host three one-day Business
Opportunities Conferences for small, minority-
owned, and women-owned businesses, historically
black colleges and universities, and private voluntary
organizations (PVOs) controlled by minorities and
women. The conferences will be May 3 in Miami,
Fla., and sometime in June in Indianapolis, Ind., and
Denver, Colo. The conferences will feature
workshops, counseling sessions, procurement and
subcontracting opportunities, and marketing tips on
doing business abroad. For registration information,
contact Gus Palmer, Thorpe International Inc., 202-
857-7835.
***
     NASA and Boeing Co., prime contractor for the
International Space Station, will host a small
business symposium May 18 at the Capitol Hill
Hyatt in Washington, D.C. Speakers give an
overview of the space station to date and discuss
near-term opportunities in mechanical/electrical
manufacturing, electrical/power/avionics,
mechanical/structural/thermal engineering, and
miscellaneous services. Pre-registration is required.
Contact Kevin Howard, NASA Small Business
Manager for International Space Station Alpha, 713-
280-7409.
***
     Although most congressional Republicans seem
to support continuing the Small Business
Administration's loan programs, Rep. Dick Chrysler,
R-Mich. and a member of the House Small Business
Committee, has characterized the program as
"corporate welfare". Others agree with him. The
Competitive Enterprise Institute has recently issued a
statement advocating the elimination of SBA and its
loan programs. The groups seems to reject the idea
that financial institutions are turning away small
businesses, particularly minorities and women,
because these loans don't offer the same returns as
bigger loans. Instead, they say that most of the small
businesses receiving SBA guarantees have a "poor
credit history." The group also believes SBA accepts
inadequate collateral, allowing borrowers to value the
collateral with no outside verification.
***
     The SBA Region VI Office in Kansas City has a
new phone number: 816-374-6380. So does the
Region III Office in King of Prussia, Pa.: 610-962-
3700.
***
     Senate Small Business Committee Chairman
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., has named Paul Cooksey,
a former SBA deputy administrator during the Bush
administration, as the committee's deputy chief
counsel. He has also served as a deputy assistant
secretary for administration at the Dept. of Treasury.
***
     Terminology watch... The Defense Dept. has a
polite way of saying that it disagrees. It uses the
word "nonconcur."

What's on your mind?

Q: My company is an SDB. Can you give me any
advice on winning subcontracts from primes?
***
A: As part of last year's Federal Acquisition
Streamlining Act, the federal government set a 5%
SDB contracting goal for all federal agencies, with
agencies negotiating subcontracting goals with
primes that can be either above or below this 5%
threshold.
     Subcontracting with primes, however, is actually
no different than contracting directly with a
government agency, except that primes may be more
motivated to work with you. Many primes are
worried about fulfilling their subcontracting goals
and, in fact, some even have problems locating
capable minority-owned firms in their particular
subcontracting niche. In some cases, primes can
even lose their contract if they cannot meet
subcontracting goals. So many primes may be quite
interested. But, just like with the federal agencies,
you will still need to provide a capabilities statement
and make a competitive bid. And, of course, not all
primes have problems finding SDBs.
     In any case, there are ways to improve your
chances for subcontracting with primes. As with all
government contracting, relationships are vital. Once
you have identified those primes that do work in
your field, call the main switchboard and ask for the
name of the person to contact. Most large primes
have a department or a person designated to help
them locate qualified small and minority businesses.
Look for the small business liaison officer or a
similar title. If they have a subcontractors list, request
to be added to it. But remember this is just a first
step.
     Because some contracts require primes to
specifically name the minority firm they will using, it
is important to make them aware of your firm early.
Try and schedule a meeting with the contact person
to give them a brief presentation of your firm's skills,
pertinent prior experience, and key personnel.
     The liaison officer will be able to give you
valuable information, such as what company
locations may need your service or product. They
can also help put you in touch with the prime's buyer
if they think you are qualified.
     Once you have successfully worked for a prime,
it will be much easier to get additional subcontracts
from the prime. So it is worth all the hard work to
get that first subcontract, even if it isn't very big.

Q: When will I be able to take advantage of the 10%
price preference for small disadvantaged businesses
contained in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining
Act?
***
A: The regulations, which tell government agencies
how to administer the new rules, must be in place by
October 1995. So you must wait until final rules are
in place--which could be earlier than the October
deadline, but don't count on it.

Congress Agrees to Paperwork Reduction Bill

     Before adjoining for their Easter/Passover recess,
the Senate and House approved the Paperwork
Reduction Act, clearing the measure for President
Clinton, who is expected to sign the bill.
     The bill was heavily supported by small business
lobbies, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
National Federation of Independent Businesses, and
National Small Business United. It is estimated that
small businesses spend one billion hours annually
filling out government paperwork at a cost of nearly
$100 billion.
     The legislation, which is part of the GOP Contract
with America and aims particularly to lessen the
paperwork burden on small business, will:
     * require a 10% reduction in government
paperwork for two years and 5% for four years after
that;
     * allow individuals and small businesses to
ignore paperwork requirements if the issuing agency
did not obtain public input in developing them; and
     * reauthorize for six years the Office of
Management and Budget's (OMB) Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is the
primary review arm for reducing government
paperwork.
     The second and most controversial provision of
the bill would excuse the public from filling out
government forms that do not have OMB-issued
control numbers. The lack of such a number means
the federal agency issuing the form did not receive
OMB approval for the information request. If this is
the case, the public is legally excused from any fines
or repercussions as a result of not complying,
including the denial of government benefits.
     The bill is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1, once the
president signs it.

GSA May Contract Out More, Less

     The reorganization of the General Services
Administration (GSA) may result in more
contracting out for some services but less for others.
     GSA has divided its operations into 16 "business
lines" and over the next year will study each of them
for ways to save money and increase efficiency.
     The first two up for review are internal computer
operations and brokerage services.
     Computer operations include 22 data processing
centers, which are staffed largely by contractor
employees. The review found the centers to be two-
and-a-half times less efficient at data processing
compared to private industry.
     GSA spends about $65 million a year in salaries,
contracts, and equipment and facilities rent to run its
internal computer operations.
     To save money, data processing will be
consolidated into two large centers, which GSA
believes will operate more efficiently.
     Older computer equipment will be phased out
rapidly and two large computer services contracts
will be allowed to lapse in 1996 and 1997. Then,
GSA will consider if it can bring service in-house
using commercial software.
     GSA employs about 850 people in brokerage
services to manage the 7,700 buildings which the
agency owns or rents space in for federal workers.
     The agency spends about $94 million a year to
manage $2.4 billion in property leases. About 70%
of leases are considered "small leases" for 10,000
square feet or less.
     GSA takes 200-400 days to complete a lease
transaction, and has begun a pilot program in three
regional offices to cut 100 days from that process.
     In the review, GSA will look at whether it would
be cheaper to contract out for commercial brokerage
services or to keep performing it in-house.

Audit Says Defense Unit Awarded Too Much to
8(a)s

     The Defense Construction Supply Center
(DCSC) awarded a "disproportionate share" of its
construction contracts to 8(a) firms, according to a
Defense Dept. Inspector General's audit.
     The audit looked at DCSC contract awards made
from Oct. 1, 1990 to June 30, 1994, when the center
awarded 95 construction contracts worth $27.1
million. DCSC's procurement budget for the same
period was about $2.4 billion.
     An Ohio contractor's complaint that DCSC paid
"substantially" more than fair market value for the
installation of a sprinkler system by awarding a
contract to an 8(a) firm without competition and gave
the 8(a) "preferential treatment" sparked the audit.
     Auditors determined that the contract was
awarded properly, but said DCSC concentrated its
8(a) awards in the construction industry (defined as
work under SIC Codes 15, 16, and 17) at the
expense of other firms.
     DCSC awarded 97% of the value of its
construction contracts to 8(a) firms. All but four of
the contracts awarded to 8(a)s were awarded as sole-
source contracts, which, the audit said, cost more
than contracts awarded competitively.
     For all other industries, DCSC awarded 2% of the
value of contracts to 8(a)s, the audit reported.
     Congress set the Defense Dept. a goal of
awarding a minimum of 5% of the value of contracts
to small disadvantaged businesses. DCSC, according
to the audit, established an unwritten policy of
relying on awards to 8(a)s in construction to help
achieve its 5% goal. DCSC officials told auditors
they believed it was easier to locate qualified 8(a)
firms in construction than in other industries.
     Auditors recommended that DCSC monitor its
contract awards more closely, so 8(a) awards are not
concentrated in just a few industries.
     The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), of which
DCSC is a part, said it would begin publishing a
quarterly report listing SDB awards by SIC Code.
     DLA disagreed with the audit's findings, however
DCSC has never met the 5% SDB goal and
therefore, could be argued, that DCSC should
increase its 8(a) awards to meet the goal.
     DLA also said all of DCSC's sole-source awards
followed long-established government rules. It added
that auditors did not count millions of dollars in
construction contracts the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers awarded for DCSC requirements which,
if included, would lower the share of contracts going
to 8(a)s.

SBIR Sails Through Congressional Hearing

     Except for a few minor recommendations, the
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
program emerged from a congressional hearing
showered with laurels.
     The hearing, held by the House Small Business
government programs subcommittee, was the last in
a two-month series that examined programs
administered by the SBA.
     SBIR was lauded for creating jobs and generating
tax revenue while adding little or no extra
administrative cost. Congress created the program in
1982 and requires federal agencies with annual
research and development (R&D) budgets of more
than $100 million to devote a percentage to funding
proposals for new and innovative technologies they
solicit from small businesses. The goal of the
program is to develop a product for the commercial
marketplace.
     Subcommittee Chairman Peter Torkildsen, R-
Mass., said  he would consider just a few changes to
the SBIR program.
     Suggestions offered included:
     * reducing paperwork and developing standard
procedures for submitting and evaluating proposals;
     * reining in solicitation topics that one business
owner described as too "far out" for people to
propose a commercially viable product in SBIR's
limited time frame; and
      * designing a computer system to verify SBIR
participation and prevent duplicate awarding of
grants.
     Few cases of multiple awards for the same
proposal have been proven, but SBIR funding was
increased beginning in fiscal year 1993 and the
General Accounting Office (GAO) raised concerns
that more companies could try to take advantage of
the system. 
     SBA officials said a computer system to verify
SBIR participation much quicker than the system
now in use should be available in the next three to
four months.
     SBIR is promoted as a program that helps small
businesses develop new and useful technologies with
little government investment. It's a three-phase
process: In Phase I, companies receive up to
$100,000 over six months to see if their proposal is
viable. In Phase II, companies get up to $750,000
over two years to refine a product or service. No
government money is offered in Phase III,
commercialization.
     All grants are awarded competitively.
     Other suggestions touched on the types of
assistance agencies can offer to SBIR grant
recipients. The legislation allows agencies to provide
technical assistance, but program officials said
recipients appear to need more help in marketing
their products commercially. The Energy Dept.
created a business assistance program, funded with
non-SBIR money, to do that.
     Dr. Samuel J. Barish, the Energy Dept. SBIR
program manager, recommended that a small
percentage of SBIR money, possibly 1%, be
permitted for business development assistance. This
would require an amendment to SBIR legislation.
     Rep. Cleo Fields, D-La., asked about minority
participation in SBIR programs. No recent studies
have been done, but SBA officials said they believe
minorities are underrepresented as a whole, receiving
about 10% of SBIR awards. GAO backed up SBA's
estimate.

DOE Awards Contract to Run Rocky Flats
     Small Business to Get 15% of Contract's Value

     Small and minority-owned businesses will win
more than a half-billion dollars from a major new
Energy Dept. contract.
     DOE earlier this month awarded a $3.5-billion,
five-year contract to Kaiser-Hill Co. for cleanup of a
former nuclear weapons plant at Rocky Flats, in
Golden, Col.
     Kaiser-Hill, a joint venture between ICF Kaiser
and CH2M Hill, two leading environmental
management companies, will take over the Rocky
Flats contract July 1, 1995. The incumbent contractor
is EG&G Rocky Flats Inc.
     In its proposal, Kaiser-Hill set a goal of awarding
15% of the contract's total value, $525 million, to
small businesses. The company said it intends to
award at least $262 million in professional and
technical services contracts to small firms and more
than $130 million to small disadvantaged businesses.
     Kaiser-Hill's proposal beat out one submitted by
Parsons Rocky Flats Corp. and promises to save
$1.2 billion over the life of the contract. The Rocky
Flats contract was the second  awarded competitively
under DOE's Contract Reform Initiative announced
last year, which calls for contracts to be
performance-based as opposed to fixed-fee.
     Work at Rocky Flats will include cleaning up and
removing all high-risk "hot spot" contamination,
stabilizing plutonium and plutonium residues,
consolidating plutonium supplies into a single
building, shipping highly enriched uranium off-site,
rehabilitating 4,100 acres of land for public use, and
remediating five hazardous sites. Kaiser-Hill said it
will complete these tasks three to four years ahead of
established targets.
     For information, contact Ron Shatrow of CH2M
Hill, 303-771-0900, ext. 2110. To get on the bidder's
list, firms can mail a capabilities statement and
corporate brochures to Kaiser-Hill, 6060 S. Willow
Dr., Englewood, Col. 80111. No contracts or
subcontracts will be available until after July 1. Once
Kaiser-Hill takes over, it will contract with a small
business to run the Rocky Flats small business
office.

 Transcript of Presidential Radio Address to the Nation

 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following is a transcript
of President Clinton's weekly radio address to the nation:

                          The Oval Office

   10:06 A.M. EST


   THE PRESIDENT: Good morning.  Tomorrow is New Year's Eve, a time
for celebration, friendship and hope.  Nineteen ninety-five has been
a good year for our country, and the coming year can be even better.

   In Washington, we all know this has been a year of serious
differences and profound debate over our nation's future direction.
But if we remain true to our values, we will prove once again that in
America we can have serious differences without leaving deep
divisions.  We know our nation is strongest when we're true to our
fundamental values, giving every American the opportunity to make the
most of their lives, remembering the duty we owe to our parents and
our children, preserving our families and our communities, keeping
America the strongest force of peace and freedom in the world.

   In our effort to advance these values, 1995 has been a time of
real progress and concrete achievement.  The key to our strength is
economic opportunity for every American.  In 1995, the ingenuity and
hard work of our people has kept the economy growing, steady and
strong.  In the past 12 months the economy created 1.75 million new
private sector jobs.  In every month the unemployment rate has been
below six percent.  All told, since 1993, we Americans have created
nearly eight million new jobs.  The stock market has broken every
record.  The deficit dropped for the third year in a row, for the
first time since Mr. Truman was President.  Long-term interest rates
continue to fall, bringing lower mortgage payments for working
families and more affordable credit for small businesses and
consumers.

   A growing economy and lower interest rates are why a million new
Americans became homeowners for the very first time in 1995.  There
were more new businesses incorporated this year than in any previous
year.  And here in Washington, in spite of all of our differences, we
made some real progress on an important issue -- political reform.
At long last, Congress passed a law which applies to themselves the
same laws they oppose in the private sector.  And at long last, after
three years of effort, the Congress passed lobby reform legislation,
banning gifts to congressmen and requiring extensive disclosure about
the activities of lobbyists.

   Most important, our communities all over America are coming
together around our values again.  In city after city, in state after
state, violent crime is down; the welfare and food stamp rolls are
down; the poverty rate is down; even the divorce rate is down.  And
for two years in a row now, the teen pregnancy rate has dropped.

   It hasn't always been an easy year for America.  There have been
moments that tested our national community.  In the wake of the
terrible bombing in Oklahoma City, which took the lives of 169
people, our nation reached out and recognized the bonds that hold us
together.  Out of the ashes of that tragedy a new sense of national
spirit took hold.  We affirmed once again that all Americans are in
it together.  We recognized once again that we can't love our
country and hate our government.

   And a strong America has been the world's strongest force for
freedom, peace and democracy in 1995.  Our brave men and women today
are in the snows of Bosnia, helping to uphold the peace agreement to
end the worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II.  And from the
cobblestone streets of Northern Ireland to the sands of the Middle
East, a strong America has helped to bring peace to regions long torn
by strife.

   Yes, 1995 has been a good year for America.  Our people have
accomplished a lot.  And it goes without saying, we still have one
major task to finish to top off the accomplishment of this year.  We
have to finish the job of balancing the budget and to do it in the
right way.

   As you know, for the last two weeks the Congress has refused to
pass legislation that would keep the federal government open to serve
the American people.  This has never happened before for this length
of time in the whole history of the republic.  And it's been very
hard on three-quarter of a million public servants who have to pay
rent and utilities and mortgage payments and buy food.  And they're
losing pay at holiday time.  And it's also cut off services for
millions of Americans who depend upon them.

   This Tuesday, if the government is not open, clean-up efforts
will be stopped cold at 32 toxic waste sites in neighborhoods around
our country.  Next week, federal funds for unemployment insurance
will begin to run out, forcing states to scramble to find ways to
keep helping workers who have lost their jobs.  And the Meals On
Wheels program to our senior citizens won't go forward.  Every day,
nine of 10 work place safety complaints go unanswered.  And every day
2,500 people can't get guaranteed home mortgages.  Every day,
thousands of young people looking for college loans can't apply for
them.  If ever we needed a reminder that our government is not our
enemy, this is it.

   Let me be clear: I am committed to balancing the budget.  Our
administration already has cut the deficit nearly in half, and I am
determined to finish the job.  For weeks I've been working in good
faith with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to find common
ground, to balance the budget in a way that reflects our values.
Yesterday I met well into the evening with Speaker Gingrich and
Majority Leader Dole.  And in just a few moments I will sit down with
them again, along with the Democratic congressional leaders.

   We are making real progress.  We know that our work is not done.
We know we have much to do, so that the American Dream will remain
alive for every citizen, and so that we can come together as a
people, and so that America can remain the strongest force for peace
the world has ever seen.

   So on this New Year's, let's resolve that we will balance the
budget, but that we'll do it in a way that will keep our country
growing and that will be true to our basic values.  That is, we'll
balance the budget without gutting Medicare and Medicaid, without
deeply cutting education or the environment, without raising taxes on
working families.  Let's resolve to reopen the government and do it
now.  And let's resolve to act without rancor or partisan bitterness
in the spirit of the new year and in the interests of the American
people.

   Nineteen ninety-five has been a year when we've been true to the
best of America.  If we'll just work hard and work together and
follow our values, 1996 can be even better.  Hillary and I want to
wish you and your families a happy and health New Year.  Thank you
for listening.

             END 10:11 A.M. EST

 Transcript of Dec. 29 White House Press Briefing By Mike McCurry

 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following is a transcript
of a press briefing held Dec. 29 by White House Press Secretary Mike
McCurry:

                          The Briefing Room


  6:10 P.M. EST


     MR. MCCURRY: Hi.  I wanted to appear briefly with my colleagues
here and give you a very short update based on the guidance that we
just got from the budget principals, who obviously continue their
hard work in the Cabinet Room, sleeves rolled up, sheets of paper
flying back and forth, and coffee being produced in copious
quantities.  I'm doing my color since I don't have much substance to
report.

     Q How many --

     Q Was it being consumed in copious quantities?

     MR. MCCURRY: The President, the Majority Leader, the Speaker,
the minority leaders and the others participating agreed that they
would work about another hour tonight.  They are working through a
series of difficult budget issues, but they clearly are very serious
about addressing those issues that are on the table.  They expect to
work about another hour tonight, take a break.

     The budget advisors group, which consists of Mr. Panetta,
Chairman Domenici, Chairman Kasich, and the two ranking members --
Mr. Sabo and Mr. Exon -- will reconvene on the Hill at approximately
8:00 p.m. or roughly a half hour after they conclude here.  They will
continue to do the type of work that they did today, working through
some of the issues that they're attempting to analyze for the benefit
of the principals.  And then, according to the President and the
others, they expect to reconvene tomorrow as early as possible based
on the advice they get from the budget advisors who will meet later
this evening.  We don't have a time or --

     Q The principals?

     MR. MCCURRY: The principals will meet again tomorrow.  We don't
have a time set, although the preference is to begin as early in the
morning as they can based on however late the advisors group works
tonight.

     That's about all I am afraid I can report at this point.  By
agreement, we're not going to attempt to summarize any of the
substance.  As one participant said, we obviously wouldn't be
continuing to meet if we thought it was going poorly.  But other than
that, I don't want to characterize any --

     Q -- no chance that the House or Senate would take up the
proposals that they mentioned in --

     MR. MCCURRY: I really don't want to speak to that.  I think it
would be more appropriate for you to direct that to either the
Speaker's or the Majority Leader's -- but if you want --

     Q Are there any plans for the --

     MR. MCCURRY: I think you know the President's view.  The
President's view is that it would be good to get the federal
government up and running, federal workers back at their desk.

     Q But what about back pay?

     Q But wait a minute, wait a minute.  Can we get them to answer
the question of whether the House or Senate will take up the issue
tonight of --

     MR. BLANKLEY: It has to be taken up in the Senate first --

     Q Could you go to the mike?

     MR. BLANKLEY: Sure.  I like that.  (Laughter.)

     MR. MCCURRY: Don't get used to it.  (Laughter.)

     MR. BLANKLEY: It would have to be taken up in the Senate first,
and it's not clear whether the Senate Democrats would be supportive.
So we have to be checking on that before we can move it --

     Q Why wouldn't they?

     Q They voted for it last time.

     Q Why wouldn't they?

     Q Is this because of the expedited --

     MR. BLANKLEY: Well, it's not clear.  That may be an issue.  So
we're still checking.

     Q What about the House?

     MR. BLANKLEY: It will have to start in the Senate, so we can't
get out of the Senate.

     Q But as of now, it is still the plan of the leadership to try
to push it through both chambers --

     Q Tonight?

     MR. BLANKLEY: We're trying to, but as I said, it would have to
start with the Senate.  You need unanimous support on both sides of
the aisle there.

     Q The Senate is still --

     Q What is it that you would try --

     Q I don't get this --

     MR. MCCURRY: Would you guys calm down?  One of you at a time
will ask a question.

     Q What are you trying to put through tonight in the Senate?

     MR. BLANKLEY: What the Speaker mentioned earlier at the photo
op, which is to have basically the provision that passed in the
Senate last week, which is attached to the Middle East act, that
would bring -- designate all government employees essential and would
not pay them, but would guarantee their pay once there is a
government up and running again, and would also have an expedited
procedure rule for the Senate so that we could get whatever agreement
we get out of here moved to the Senate with alacrity.  And there's
some speculation that the Senate Democrats may not want to consent to
unanimity on that point.

     Q Do you know what the state of play in the Senate is?

     MR. HINE: The Senate is still in session, prepared to deal with
it, and Senator Dole may have more to say on the floor once we're
done here.

     Q Logistically, Mike, what would you anticipate that will happen
at the end of the principals meeting?  Would you come out and say
something or will they return to the Hill, have --

     Q Yes, what happens in an hour?

     MR. MCCURRY: We did not cover that point.  We will either
provide another brief readout which will not be much different from
this readout, or alternatively, have some type of joint statement as
we did at the conclusion of the meeting last Friday.

     Q You wouldn't expect an appearance by the principals here?

     MR. MCCURRY: I don't expect an appearance by them here, and I'm
not aware of any plans by the Republican leaders or the Democratic
leaders to attempt to do any type of readout tonight on meetings or
make any type of comment.  There obviously -- this is a work in
progress, and the work will continue tomorrow.

     MR. HALLEY: On the continuing resolution -- I work for Senator
Daschle -- when this bill comes up, the Democrats will object because
of the fast track procedures that are being attached to it that would
affect consideration of any budget bill.  But at the same time, we
will offer a clean continuing resolution to fully open the
government, as we've been trying to do for days.  So the one that is
being considered by the Republicans, we will object to that because
of the expedited procedures that have been attached to it.  But we
will offer a clean continuing --

     Q Does that mean you won't give unanimous consent tonight to
that?

     MR. HALLEY: That's correct.

     Q What's wrong with the expedited procedure?

     MR. HALLEY: It violates basically most of the procedures of the
Senate in terms of amendments and debate, et cetera.

     Q But hold on for a second.  Didn't you vote for something just
like this before Christmas --

     MR. HALLEY: No, that was the Middle East part of it.  There's
three parts to this thing that's being put --

     Q No, we're talking about just calling all the workers
essential.  Do you have an objection to that?

     Q That passed last Friday evening.

     MR. HALLEY: No.  There are three pieces to the thing that are
being put together by the Republicans.  One is deeming workers to be
essential, which we agree with that.  Two is the Middle East
initiative, which we agree with that.  What we will be objecting to
is the legislating of expedited procedures to -- that would harm our
ability to both amend and debate the budget bill.  And so we will
object to that vehicle, but then we will offer a clean continuing
resolution to open the government.

     Q Well, when you mean a clean continuing resolution do you mean
to --

     Q -- what the prospects for that?

     Q Michael, what's the White House position on this legislation
with the three parts?  Do you support the Senate Democrats or the
House --

     MR. MCCURRY: The President indicated that, earlier today, he
wants federal workers back at their desks and working.  He wants the
services of the government available to the American people.  And we
understand that there will have to be discussions on Capitol Hill to
make that happen quickly.  We hope that that will happen as quickly
as possible.

     Q In other words, he sides with the Republicans, not the
Democrats on this?

     MR. MCCURRY: No.  In other words, I very artfully ducked the
question.  (Laughter.)

     MR. BLANKLEY: Let me just point out that the provision that
apparently the Senate Democrats are going to block is the same
expedited procedure that you have on a reconciliation bill.  And,
obviously, their concern would be that they wouldn't -- it would get
an agreement here that certain Democratic senators might not be able
to destroy the agreement by a filibuster on the floor after the
members here have worked it out.  So there's -- that's a procedural
question.

     Q Tony, the Speaker is still against a clean CR, is that not
correct?

     MR. MCCURRY: Listen, I want John to do -- and this is -- our
purpose here is -- my colleagues are here to give you an update on
the meeting that's going on here.  I think if they want to talk about
the procedural issues, which are important, and the rights of
individual senators to raise points, which the White House
acknowledges is a very important part of the procedure on Capitol
Hill, they should really brief you up on Capitol Hill about those
procedures.

     Q But he has the right of rebuttal.

     MR. HALLEY: Yes, thank you.  But to restate, the Democrats, as
we've tried to do for weeks, are fully supportive of opening the
government and fully supportive of that -- the piece of this, which
is to deem workers as essential.  And so that's not the issue.

     The reason we'd be objecting to this procedural notion is,
again, because it would deny the ability to amend and debate fully.
And as we did in 1990, there is a way to reestablish a reconciliation
bill.  As you may recall, in 1990 after the agreement was reached, we
did another budget resolution that would then trigger a
reconciliation bill under the full procedures of reconciliation.  And
so that option is open to us.  And we felt that, therefore, we did
not need to run around completely the entire budget process with
something that we'd do this evening.

     MR. MCCURRY: Okay, anything more on the meeting going on now
before we exit?

     Q Yes, Mike.  Does the President intend or feel he will need to
before Senator Daschle and Senator Exon leave the White House
tonight, make the point to them that apparently if everything is so
close to reopening the government, they should set aside -- does he
intend to have a separate thing with them, saying set aside your
objection to this; I really want you to do it?

     MR. MCCURRY: No, he has such good working relations with them
that I don't think he feels that there's a need to cover that point.

     Q There were briefings on the Hill earlier about the areas that
were covered at the budget advisory report, or whatever it's called.
Can you say whether the leaders here essentially worked within that
framework?  Did they go in it or out of it or --

     MR. MCCURRY: Based on what I know -- I don't have a complete
readout of their entire discussions tonight.  They did review some of
those issues that the advisers dealt with today.  They also moved
into what are referred to in their argot now as the tier three
issues, which are more difficult issues that are -- where the
differences are more fundamental between the sides.

     Q Which one?  Medicaid --

     MR. MCCURRY: I'm just not -- we're not authorized to get into
the substance of their dialogue.

     Q Mike, can you explain what the benefit would be of this piece
of legislation that's having its difficulties this evening?  It
sounds as though what you're talking about doing is essentially
bringing 260,000 people back who then will join a bunch of other
people who aren't getting paychecks.  They'll all be getting their
paychecks, there still will be money for their designated agencies to
--

     MR. MCCURRY: We would prefer, obviously, any type of continuing
resolution that would reopen the government.  That's been the
President's view all along.  We believe the government should be
open.  We have believed for a long time there should be a clean CR
that would do so.  But we're dealing, and we have to be realistic
about the environment we're dealing with.  And these gentlemen can
speak better than I can on the attitudes on the Hill.

     On the other hand, the effective legislation that would except
federal employees who are currently furloughed from the furlough
would be to incur a legal obligation to pay them.  That legal
obligation would be very useful to federal workers that need any type
of short-term loan to make mortgage payments or who can produce that
as evidence to a creditor that they got the ability to pay bills that
are due.  I think that would be at least some comfort to federal
workers.  It would be far better for them to get a paycheck, far
better for them to go back to work, far better for them to provide
services to the American people.  That at least it's something, and
something is better than nothing.

     Q So you don't mind if they try to amend -- they block the
ability to amend the --

     MR. MCCURRY: As I just heard, that -- I could tell from their
discussion, that's way over my head.  I think there is some work,
clearly, that Congress will have to do on this.  The President's view
he stated very clearly earlier; he would like to see those federal
workers back to work as quickly as possible.

     Q Any guidance beyond talks tomorrow?

     MR. MCCURRY: No, I don't have anything for the days beyond that
or what time they might finish tomorrow, or would they finish in time
for various people to make travel plans.  I don't have any guidance
on that.

     Q How are you going to let us know, Mike, if they're going to
meet and what time in the morning?  All-call or --

     MR. MCCURRY: We will do an all-call tomorrow and also put in on
the recording as soon as we know what the time is.  But I would check
in here.  I think the President still plans to do the radio address
live tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m., so you will -- at least at that
point --

     Q Live from the talks?

     Q You wouldn't expect it before the radio address, would you,
Mike?

     MR. MCCURRY: I'm sorry, let me amend that.  Just in case they
want to start earlier, if they end up deciding they want to start
earlier, there's some chance that we might have to pretape the radio
address earlier in the morning.  So check here tomorrow morning.

     Q What is it going to be on?

     Q If Senator Dole give the rebuttal, will he do that live --

     Q Pass the mike around the table.

     Q Is he going to do that from here?

     MR. HINE: I think we're operating under the same conditions that
Mike on that.  It's entirely possible --

     Q Mike, just to clarify -- you're not suggesting that this
measure that's being conducted this evening would restore the
government to full functioning.

     MR. MCCURRY: No, it would -- our understanding is it would allow
federal workers to return to their work, it would allow them to do
certain accepted activity that would be authorized by their
individual agencies.  That would be some progress.  It would allow in
some cases, my understanding is, for applications to be processed.
For example, one example is it's conceivable to me under this
legislation, unless my colleagues disagree, that they might be able
to begin issuing passports again for people who wish to travel, just
as one example.

     Now, that's an activity that doesn't incur any additional
obligation to spend money on the part of the government, but it
allows some measure of government services to be restored to the
American people.  And that would be better than nothing, as I said
earlier.

     Q Can you open the national parks under this?

     MR. MCCURRY: I don't know the answer to that.  I don't know the
answer.

     Q Sometime this evening could you get us a reaction to -- the
President's reaction to the Senate Democrats stopping that process
that you just outlined?

     MR. MCCURRY: I think I commented on that already.  They didn't
say they were stopping it --

     MR. HALLEY: We're not.  We're --

     MR. MCCURRY: They've got a plan to reopen the government by a
clean continuing resolution, which is something, as you know, the
President is strongly supportive of.

     Q What's the chance of getting a clean CR?

     Q Do you have any idea what the mood is in the room?

     MR. MCCURRY: Unless my colleagues would dispute this
characterization, they clearly are very serious in purpose.  As I
said, many of them have their coats off, they've got their sleeves
rolled up, they've got pens out and --

     Q Why didn't they do that before?

     MR. MCCURRY: -- they're working very seriously on the relevant
issues.

     Q Is the Senate essentially in town?

     MR. HINE: Yes, we're in session.  We're in recess subject to the
call of the chair.

     Q So if there had to be a roll call -- you don't expect a
roll-call vote tomorrow, for example?  If the majority found it
necessary to have a roll-call vote to tamp down the Democrats
thinking --

     MR. HINE: I'm not certain that that's how events are going to
unfold.

     Q Mike, why couldn't all of this have been done Tuesday or
Wednesday?

     MR. MCCURRY: Tuesday or Wednesday -- you mean earlier in this
week?  The process that was defined by the principals last Friday, a
week ago today, called for the staff-level discussions and analysis
to begin on Tuesday and Wednesday, which occurred.  It clearly was
very useful for that to happen because it's been the premise for a
lot of the work that occurred today, and that the principals are
doing now.

     There was an alternative procedure that had been discussed a
while back.  That was not available to the President or the
principals for reasons everyone in this room knows.  This is the
process that was available.  This is the process that at the moment
appears to be working.

     Q A question for John, just to clear up the Senate action.  Does
the Senate action -- say, it happened tonight or tomorrow -- does
that have to be by unanimous consent, or can there be a vote on it,
which presumably could override the Democrats' objection?  And then
could the Democrats, say, filibuster to prevent a vote?

     MR. HALLEY: No -- I mean, our intent is to -- I mean, you would
need consent at this time of day.  Again, our intent -- we've tried
I'd say 10 times in the last two weeks to pass a continuing
resolution that would open the government, and that's our position.

     Q A continuing resolution, not just this deeming measure?

     MR. HALLEY: Right.

     Q You're talking about a real, live CR?

     MR. HALLEY: Right, a complete opening.  A real, live
put-people-back-to-work and pay them, and open the agencies.

     MR. MCCURRY: This meeting will be over before the briefing ends
if we don't move on.

     Q John, can you spell your last name?

     MR. HALLEY: H-a-l-l-e-y.

     Q Any idea when you might be able to give us some guidance about
Hilton Head?

     MR. MCCURRY: It won't be tonight, and it will be late in the day
tomorrow.  I just don't have any way to give you any guidance.

     Q Can you say how early could these talks -- 7:00 a.m.-8:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning?

     MR. MCCURRY: I believe that will depend entirely on how late Mr.
Panetta, the chairman and the congressional group works this evening.
I think their intent is to work rather late and that might make the
start not at the crack of dawn, but somewhat around mid-morning
tomorrow.

     Q At 8:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m.?

     MR. MCCURRY: And then I would suspect that the President and the
other principals would commence shortly after that.  So I don't -- my
guess is around mid-morning, but we'll wait and see and give you
guidance as we've got it.

     Q Tomorrow the principals meeting would be back here, not at the
Capitol?

     MR. MCCURRY: It sounded to me like the intent is to meet here.

     THE PRESS: Thank you.

 Transcript of Second Dec. 29 White House Press Briefing By Mike
McCurry

 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following is a transcript
of a second press briefing held Dec. 29 by White House Press
Secretary Mike McCurry:


                          The Briefing Room


  7:25 P.M. EST

     MR. MCCURRY: Second verse, same as the first.  Bye.  (Laughter.)

     Q Do you know now how the President feels about the Democratic
move in the Senate?

     MR. MCCURRY: The President believes that we'll able to work --
given the cooperation shown today, we can work something out that
will allow federal workers to resume their diligent service to the
American people.

     Q Tonight?

     Q What's that mean?

     MR. MCCURRY: It will be up to senators and leaders on the Hill
to resolve those issues, but we hope they will.

     Q Well, does he agree that the Democrats have a point?

     MR. MCCURRY: He understands the concerns the senators have to
make sure they've got the right protected to debate very important
budget matters and the very few hours of hearings and debate devoted
to aspects of the Republican budget.  And he well understands why
people are protecting the right to have further debate.  At the same
time, he will encourage all members of Congress from both parties to
act quickly to allow federal workers to return to their posts.

     Q Mike, when you say work something out, does the President --
is the President given to understand that there will be something
done today or tomorrow to work something out to return furloughed
federal employees back to the job -- to their jobs?

     MR. MCCURRY: The sense the President got is that congressional
leaders on both sides of the aisle are working urgently to solve the
matter.

     Q -- conciliatory to me.

     MR. MCCURRY: -- let me tell you what I know about tonight.
They're taking a break.  Mr. Panetta and his group from the White
House will return to Capitol Hill, begin meeting with the so-called
budget advisers group, approximately 8:00 p.m.  It's my understanding
they do not plan any further readouts this evening.  They are
continuing to work through issues that they then prepare for
discussion by the budget advisers.  I anticipate that staffs are
going to be working throughout the evening and into the morning to
prepare discussion documents that will be used by the principals
tomorrow.  They've agreed to reconvene here at the White House at
10:30 a.m. tomorrow.  That's the principals group.

     Q How does that affect the radio address?  Still be done live?

     MR. MCCURRY: The radio address is going to be done taped just to
protect -- make sure we don't have any -- because the President may
be involved in pre-briefs prior to the meeting.

     Q What's the subject?

     MR. MCCURRY: It will be about the budget.

     Q When will that be available, Mike?

     MR. MCCURRY: He's taping it tomorrow morning, and we expect it
will be available just shortly before air time.

     Q Mike, the Republicans all left tonight without comment.  Did
the meeting end in an atmosphere of --

     MR. MCCURRY: It ended very amicably.  And the President, the
Speaker, the Majority Leader and the Democratic leaders agreed that
the readout that you heard earlier this evening would suffice for the
work that they did between roughly 6:00 p.m.  and 7:20 p.m.

     Q -- resolution tomorrow, Mike?  What does it look like?

     MR. MCCURRY: Say again.

     Q For the prospects of a resolution tomorrow.

     MR. MCCURRY: A resolution -- you mean a resolution of issues or
--

     Q Yes.

     MR. MCCURRY: They will make progress tomorrow, but I don't --
the work they're doing, it would be very hard at this point to
predict that they would arrive at any final agreements tomorrow.
They've got a lot of work to do tomorrow.

     Q Do you this going, then, into Sunday?

     MR. MCCURRY: Conceivably, yes.  But that's not been decided yet.

     Q Do you have a reaction from the President to the Daschle
blocking this plan that --

     MR. MCCURRY: Yes, we talked about that earlier.

     Q Is there a meeting with Panetta and the budget advisers
tomorrow morning before the principals meeting?  There was some talk
about a 9:00 a.m. meeting on the Hill before the principals came down
here.  Was there any talk about that?

     MR. MCCURRY: They may -- the budget advisers group may reconvene
tomorrow morning, but they -- that would be prior to the 10:30 a.m.
meeting --

     Q Why did the President cut off a reporter from asking Gingrich
whether he had caved?

     MR. MCCURRY: The President -- (inaudible) -- felt that there had
been any indication by the Speaker that he had, quote, unquote, caved
-- (inaudible) -- the President also thought he might give a better
answer than the Speaker might.  (Laughter.)

     Q What?

     Q He wants peace to reign.

     Q -- single issue was set aside as agreed upon or anything
narrowed substantially --

     MR. MCCURRY: The procedure they've been using for these
discussions is that any element discussed and any element that they
reach consensus upon would not change the admonition that nothing is
finally agreed until everything is agreed.

     Q Your sense, Mike, about any travel plans the President may
have that could be tomorrow or more likely Sunday now?

     MR. MCCURRY: I have no sense, but the President seemed to be
enjoying himself here as much as he would in South Carolina.
(Laughter.)

     Q You have no sense of that?

     Q -- answer to that question that nothing is agreed until
everything is agreed -- what you're saying is, whatever differences
they narrow today have no permanent status because everything has to
be agreed to or--

     MR. MCCURRY: As a common negotiating device, they usually --
even as they work through complicated issues, that they reserve the
right at the end of the discussion to go back and look at the entire
package.  And they have done so here, and I suspect they will
continue to do so -- that they will go back and look at the final
package that they get, if they in fact get one, before they agree
that they've got a final agreement.

     Q But you -- as you agree, you guys are just checking it off and
moving on to the next one, and then --

     MR. MCCURRY: Yes, but what they're doing -- they're doing -- I
mean, without getting into the substance, because I'm not authorized
to get into the substance, they are working through a set of issues
that have been identified.  The budget advisers today met, dealt with
a series of budget issues, not all of them, but many of them.  They
were analyzed in some detail, discussions papers were prepared.  They
were reviewed today.  The budget advisers will now go back up to the
Hill, continue to address elements of the budget discussion.  They
will be analyzed, discussion drafts will be prepared, and they'll
work again on it tomorrow.  They're taking these issues serially as
they work through a series of contentious issues that range from the
-- starting with the less controversial and moving to the more
controversial.  And they clearly now are moving into areas that are
more controversial.

     Q On the Hill tonight do you think there will be action to get
the workers back to work?

     MR. MCCURRY: I cannot predict that.  You've heard the discussion
of the representatives and the congressional leadership earlier, and
it will be up to them to --

     Q Mike, are there going to be simultaneous meetings with the
budget leaders up on the Hill, meeting at the same time that the
meetings down here are taking place, or do they complete --

     Q I think Tony Blankley said --

     Q He did indicate -- Tony indicated that they'd be up on the
Hill, you know, working on churning stuff out even for future issues
-- even as --

     MR. MCCURRY: Oh, yes, they have -- well, we have -- there have
been staff -- staff work has continued even while the principals are
meeting, yes.  In fact, there's some -- staff has been available in
the Roosevelt Room in case there is a need for expert advice on
budget related issues, and they continue.

     Q With Cabinet-level people?  Will they be meeting also at the
same --

     MR. MCCURRY: I wouldn't rule it out, but mostly the people who
are there are more staff level experts.

     Q -- radio address subject?

     MR. MCCURRY: It will be the budget situation generally.  It will
also be, because it's the last radio address of the year, it will be
a review of 1995.

     Q Mike, unrelated, is the policy out here changed at all, or was
that just a mis --

     MR. MCCURRY: That was a regrettable misunderstanding, and I
believe we have got meetings going on right now to straighten out --

     Q That's not the first time it's happened today.  It's happened
several times.

     MR. MCCURRY: I understand, and there's --

     Q Some people decided not to provoke a fight and --

     MR. MCCURRY: Right.  They're working to clarify what the ground
rules are on -- (inaudible) -- because they obviously --

     Q Is the President going out tonight?

     MR. MCCURRY: Say again.

     Q Is the President going out tonight?

     MR. MCCURRY: Not that I'm aware of.  Is he?  He is?  Pool alert
-- that he may go out for dinner apparently.

     Q Where?

     MR. MCCURRY: Okay, see you all tomorrow.

     THE PRESS: Thank you.

             END 7:35 P.M. EST

 Transcript of Presidential Remarks in Photo Opportunity with
Congressional Leaders

 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following is a transcript
of remarks made by President Clinton today during a photo opportunity
with Congressional Leaders:


                         The Cabinet Room


  11:35 A.M. EST


     THE PRESIDENT: I want to be brief today because we're getting
off to a little late start.  We've got a lot to do.  I have three
things to say.  I think we made a good start yesterday, we're making
progress, and I believe we need to open the government.  I hope we
can agree to do all that.

     Q Sir, do you know any more information on the soldier who was
wounded in Bosnia?

     THE PRESIDENT: Our reports are sketchy and I have tried to get
an update, but what I do know is that there were apparently two
vehicles and four soldiers involved.  Only one was seriously hurt and
he has been medivacked to Croatia in a hospital there, and we
understand he's in stable condition.

     But mines have always been our biggest concern and we're working
very hard on it, but that's what happened.  And we'll continue to
monitor it and do the best we can.  The mission itself is going very
well.  The people have received our soldiers very well and I'm very
well satisfied with the progress.  And I'm obviously very sorry this
happened, but they're making good progress on the mine problem, but
it's going to be difficult to get rid of them all.

     Q -- the measure to get the workers back that's going to get
through Congress?

     SENATOR DOLE: Well, it passed the House.  We hope we can pass in
the Senate today, so make some progress.

     SENATOR DASCHLE: We tried to pass a clean CR, one without any
conditions.  And that was objected to, but I hope we can work
something out.

     Q But isn't the fact now that the Democrats are holding things
up?

     SENATOR DASCHLE: Not at all.  As a matter of fact, as I said, we
passed a continuing resolution -- we had no conditions.  It sent
people back to work, and that was objected to.  So we're not trying
to hold anything up here.  We hope we can get some sort of an
agreement as early as today.

     Q Well, what's it going to take to get a deal?

     SPEAKER GINGRICH: Well, let me just something.  I think the
President had a right -- we're glad to have you all in.  We have a
lot of work to do.  We made, I thought, real progress last night.  It
is not easy.  We have very significant areas we have to work on, but
I thought the spirit was very positive.  We don't just want to get
the federal workers back, we want to get them paid.  And in order to
do that, I think we've got to get this whole thing worked out.
But I thought we had a great start last night.  And with you all's
permission, I think we can get a lot more done in the next few hours.

     Q Mr. President, is the message from the Democrats basically
that they don't trust you?

     THE PRESIDENT: We've got to go to work.  Thank you very much.

     THE PRESS: Thank you.

 Transcript of Remarks by President Clinton in Sunday Photo
Opportunity With Congressional Leaders

 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following is a transcript
of remarks by the president in a photo opportunity with congressional
leaders:

                         The Cabinet Room
9:50 A.M. EST

     Q  Mr. President, are you close to a deal today?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me tell you where we are today.  We had
a very long discussion yesterday.  We discussed almost all the issues
where we had differences on our plans financially, in terms
the dollars.  And this morning we're going to have an extensive
discussion of the Medicare policy.  And then we're going to give our
staffs some instruction.  We're going to meet again on Tuesday and
we're going to do our best to work through this and come to an
accord.

     My New Year's wish is that we'll get this balanced
budget plan and we'll do it in a way that protects the things that we
care about -- the Medicare, the Medicaid, the education and
environment, the other issues, and we've been working at it.  I've
been very well pleased and I think we've been somewhat successful
because we haven't said very much about it.  We've just got to keep
working until we reach an accord.

     Q  Mr. President, will you touch on -- negotiations --

     Q  Will you leave town today without reopening the
government, of the three --

     SPEAKER GINGRICH:  I'm sure we'll be talking about that, that's
one of the things we want to get done and get agreed to.  So we're
trying to work out how to get the federal employees back to work
-- we'd also like to get them paid, I think that's an integral
part of getting them back to work.  But as the President said, I
think, frankly, most of our success so far has been that we've been
in this room talking with each other and not getting involved in
negotiating in public, and I think we've made a lot of progress.

     Q  To follow on that, sir, is it healthy to have the
House speakers talking on CNN yesterday on the --

     SPEAKER GINGRICH:  Oh, that is nonsense.  I told the
President on Friday that I was so favorable about him in answering
their big question on Evans & Novak that I thought he'd want to see
it.  The fact is we're working very well together.  I was asked a
question about the campaign next year, and I suspect if you ask Mr.
Gephardt or Vice President Gore about how they'll campaign next year,
they'll give you similar answers.  We're negotiating very well from a
government standpoint in here and I think we have a lot to be proud
of.  Our New Year's wish ought to be that we get this done and give
the American people a balanced budget and the government paid for and
back to work.

     SENATOR DOLE:  The Senate is going to meet at noon,
we'll try to pass something to help the federal employees.

     Q  Are you closer?

     SENATOR DOLE:  Oh, we're about six feet apart.
(Laughter.)

     SENATOR DASCHLE:  We'll be a lot closer in a couple of
hours.  (Laughter.)

     THE PRESIDENT:  We're working at it steady.  Happy New
Year everybody.

     THE PRESS:  Happy New Year.


             END                          9:54 A.M. EST

 Transcript of White House Press Briefing by Mike McCurry

 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 /U.S. Newswire/ --  Following is a transcript
of a press briefing by Mike McCurry:

                          The Briefing Room
12:40 P.M. EST

     MR. MCCURRY:  Let me just tell you what's going on right
now.  The President of the United States is thanking individually the
various members of the budget staffs that have been supporting the
administration team during these discussions, folks from Health and
Human Services, Treasury, OMB, the National Economic Council, Mr.
Panetta's staff, those that have done extraordinary work over the
last week and, as you'll be able to tell in a moment, have got an
extraordinary amount of work today and tomorrow.

     The budget discussions today led to an agreement by the
principals to instruct staff to really summarize the discussions
they've been able to have over the last several days, which resulted
in exploring the differences that exist in a range of areas from
income support programs to welfare, to tax issues, to health care
finance issues -- to really summarize those discussions and draw
together the places where there appeared to be some agreement between
the Republican side, the administration and the congressional
Democrats; and then, also set forth in more precise detail the areas
that there clearly are still differences.

     That will lead to a meeting that will happen here at the
White House Tuesday evening, either late afternoon or early evening
-- I suspect more early evening -- between the budget principals.
They will reconvene, review the discussion document that is prepared
by staff over the next day and a half, and they will begin, I think
they all believe, the more serious discussions of tradeoffs that
exist on the large issues that will be fundamental to a final
agreement.  But they all clearly remain committed to this process and
the process is working.  They are making progress because they are
defining the areas of agreement and disagreement more clearly.  And
the President's satisfied that they're making progress.

     The President also strongly encouraged the congressional
leaders to find a way to pass some measure that would restore federal
workers to their rightful places of employment.  He also wants them
to be paid, but he understands that those are -- there are different
points of view on that issue.  He hopes they can resolve some of
these issues.

     Q  What's his point of view on that?

     MR. MCCURRY:  He believes they should be working, they
should be paid, and the government should be fully open, as he said
over and over and over again.

     Q  Any suggestion, any hint that they were close to
working some deal today?

     MR. MCCURRY:  They worked on it a lot.  There was
considerable side-bar discussion during this meeting between House
and Senate staffers, and Senate staffers between the Republican and
Democratic side, and that will lead to whatever action occurs on the
Hill shortly.

     Q  Did Dole and Daschle say they would --

     MR. MCCURRY:  I'm not going to comment on the business
that they need to do themselves on the Hill.

     Q  Mike, Tony Blankley said that there was one area
that was not covered in the walk-through.  What is that area?  He
said it was one major area.

     MR. MCCURRY:  I suspect -- can you run and check on
this?  I suspect the answer to that is Medicaid.  But Barry will run
that down.

     Q  They didn't act on that at all?

     MR. MCCURRY:  They spent a lot of time discussing
Medicare.  The almost entire discussion today was devoted to Medicare
and different options.  And what the President and congressional
leaders asked for is something that really defines more clearly what
the policy choices are in Medicare given the respective positions of
the various budget proposals that are out there.

     Q  Mike, in the event that there is some kind of deal
in the Senate, will there be any briefing here on what -- the
technicalities of what that means for the government?

     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, if there's a final agreement in
Congress that would restore federal workers to their jobs, OMB staff
will be available to talk about how that will affect any restart
activities that they have.  But we'll direct that to OMB because
they'll be in the best place to analyze that.

     Q  Mike, can you confirm that as of yesterday they had
an agreement in principle to at least a packet of savings of $100
billion in social spending?

     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, that would be -- that requires some
rough eyeballing that I don't think you can really do under the
circumstances.  There are different ways that you can look at the
categories of things they've done here.  There are some areas where
there are clear agreements and they should be able to rather quickly
write the legislative language that would lock in some of the things
they've agreed to.

     There are other areas where it's a little fuzzier, where
there are some different options that exist and you could get a range
of savings depending on how you calculate it.  But my guess is -- I
saw that comment in one of the stories today; I think that was
probably a rough eyeball guess that someone made that would try to
put a numeric value on some of the work they've done.  Frankly, I'd
caution people here against using that kind of calculation because
the ranges are so large when you look at the big ticket issues.
There could be considerably more in savings, depending on how you
judge the progress they made on some of these discussions.

     Q  What are the differences on Medicaid without going
into detail?  Are they financial or are they philosophical?

     MR. MCCURRY:  Both.

     MR. TOIV:  Medicaid is the issue, but it was discussed
in the context of block grants, the whole block grant issue, but not
separately as a --

     MR. MCCURRY:  The fundamental dispute there is the
guarantee of health care coverage and the federal entitlement and
what happens if you block-grant it.  Now, that's a large issue and
one of the issues covered particularly as they dealt with domestic
discretionary spending, which they did both yesterday afternoon and
yesterday evening.

     So I think that they've touched on that aspect of
Medicaid, but they haven't gone through all the -- they haven't gone
through it in the same detail and precision on that issue as they
have some of the other areas that they've looked at.  Now, that will
be covered by some of the staff work.  They are going to take some
look at issues related to that as they work over the next day and a
half.  They'll be preparing some side-by-side analyses of how the
different issues play out.

     Q  Are they working from the same base numbers?

     MR. MCCURRY:  They're working from the same calculation
of what the budget impact is based on CBO numbers, yes.

     Q  What's the point of all these hours of walking
through this?  It seems to me we all know what the big differences
are.

     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, that's not necessarily true.  I
mean, everyone knows what the big differences are and what the big
numbers look like on a single sheet of paper.  But remember, every
one of those large numbers is premised on fundamental policy
decisions that have a great deal of nuance and complexity associated
with them.  And I think it's encouraging and the principals are
encouraged at how detailed these discussions have been.  They have
looked item by item at these policy implications of the large
numbers.

     I think many Americans think, well, gee, you get
together in the room and you split the difference in a simple
arithmetic.  That's not policymaking.  Policymaking requires
attention to the detail that underscores each of those numbers.  And
that's the work they've been doing.

     Now, based on the very intense discussions they've had,
the staff can now summarize in a much more detailed fashion what the
specifics of a legislative approach to a final budget agreement would
look like.  That's encouraging because it means if they do reach an
agreement on a final budget package, the work of assembling that and
putting it in legislative language would be considerably easier based
on the discussions they've had here.  In a sense, one participant
compared this to something like a conference committee on the Hill;
they're doing much the same thing they would do in a House-Senate
conference committee, looking at big issues, discussing the policy
differences, and then making it possible for staff to write what
amounts to a conference report.

     Q  Are they getting a sense of how far away they are
from reaching some kind of final agreement?  Are they getting a sense
of the kind of time frame they're looking at?

     MR. MCCURRY:  They could be so near or so far away
because it will depend in part on what types of tradeoffs they make
on the large issues.  They have not attempted to take the big issues,
as Hillary just said that everyone knows are out there, and reconcile
them.  They've approached this from saying, let's narrow as closely
as we can the differences that exist and define better what types of
tradeoffs will exist once you've reached those big decisions.  But I
suspect that by Tuesday night when they meet again, they're going to
start moving to those more fundamental issues that will have to be
embraced if there's going to be a final agreement, which is why right
now it's impossible to say one way or another whether they will
actually reach an agreement.

     Q  -- an agreement in the order in which they'll take
up the big issues?  Because, as you've said in the past, you would
prefer that the spending and the final decisions on spending
determine the size of a tax cut.

     MR. MCCURRY:  I don't believe -- they have given a list
of specifics to the staff to address, but I can't say for certain
that the principals will work through those issues in the same order
-- that they go from income maintenance through health care finance
issues to discretionary spending issues to revenue issues.  But I
don't guarantee that that's the order in which they will be addressed
on Tuesday night.

     Q  Would you say that they have finished stage one,
the walk-through process, then and are getting -- are heading into
stage two, the decision-making process?

     MR. MCCURRY:  They finished the walk-through process
during the course of the day yesterday, with the exception of the
more detailed discussion of Medicare that they wished to have today.
They are now preparing for what amounts to the tradeoffs that will
have to occur.

     Q  Is the President ready to compromise and trade off?

     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, the President is ready to continue
to discuss these issues in good faith.

     Q  In what context have they discussed Social
Security?

     MR. MCCURRY:  It has been related to many of their
discussions of health care finance, Medicare in particular, and
related in some respects to their AFDC discussions since they're all
covered by the various titles of the Social Security Act.

     Q  Did they talk about it in terms of --

     MR. MCCURRY:  They've had -- I believe they had a very
brief discussion of the CPI issue, and there was not instant
resolution of that.

     Q  You said that there's a day-and-a-half discussion
beginning on Tuesday evening that concerns --

     MR. MCCURRY:  I'm sorry, it was a day and a half for
work now.  The staff is going to be working -- one of the reasons the
President wanted to spend some time with our courageous and noble
staffers is they are now going to work for the rest of the day today
and they're apparently going to start about 9:00 a.m. tomorrow and
they'll be able to work all day long tomorrow.  That's not going to
be any -- we're not going to arrange any press coverage of that,
that's just the work they're going to be doing, both informal and
probably getting together at various points.

     Q  Going back to -- how would you characterize the
agreement so far money-wise?  You won't say $100 billion.  How would
you characterize it -- issue-wise, money-wise?

     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, they've made good progress.  It's a
large sum of money, but it's not satisfactory -- wouldn't be
sufficient to reach the balanced budget goals.  That would require
some additional decision-making that obviously wouldn't happen before
Tuesday night.

     Q  Can you offer any color or anecdotal details of
today's meeting?

     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, they continued -- we do the best on
food more than anything else.  (Laughter.)  They had the traditional
congressional meeting donuts back today, for some reason.  We were on
a health food kick yesterday, but today -- normally, when the
bipartisan congressional leadership meet with the President they have
wonderful donuts available.  And they reappeared and quickly
disappeared during the meeting today.

     There was a lot of kibitzing.  As the result of being
together over the couple of days, there were moments where the
partisan sides are able to tease each other or get little quips in on
each other from time to time, and there was a fair amount of that
going on.  I don't have a specific example of that that I can think
of off my head, but there's some of what I would describe as general
ribbing back and forth.

     The Speaker was concerned that we all make sure that
--he was concerned about a question he got in the pool session this
morning and he was nervous that we not over-interpret those -- the
appearance on the Evans and Novak Show.  Some of us watched that and
some of us managed to stay awake through it.  (Laughter.)

     Q  As he shouted Ron down -- did they discuss that?
As he shouted Ron down, did he and the President then discuss that?

     MR. MCCURRY:  No, they didn't.  They didn't, although
the Speaker reached that with some of us and we didn't take any
offense at his remarks.

     Q  You didn't take any offense at the remarks at all?

     MR. MCCURRY:  No.  Compared to other things that he
says, they -- (laughter.)

     Q  Dole and Gingrich have said before that they see
Wednesday as sort of a deadline; they're going to be adjourning
Congress and reopening Congress.  Is there any sense that you'll know
by Wednesday that you're going to have a deal or you're not going to
have a deal?

     MR. MCCURRY:  You mean on this question of federal
workers and --

     Q  No, no, no.  No, over the budget deal, the budget
negotiations.

     Q  The CR would expire -- I mean, they're saying that
you're supposed to have it finished in the first session, which
is --

     MR. MCCURRY:  In the statutory and in the first session
is on Wednesday, and clearly one reason they're meeting Tuesday night
is with that deadline in mind.  But I wouldn't predict at this point
it would be possible to get an outline of agreement by Wednesday.
Certainly everyone hopes to get an agreement on a balanced budget as
quickly as possible.

     Q  I watched the back-and-forth there.  The money that
we're not supposed to put a numerical figure on that's not
necessarily $100 billion, but is something -- what does that concern?

     MR. MCCURRY:  I made that so absolutely, magnificently
impenetrable, there would be no way you could answer that.
(Laughter.)  Look, the reason is as you look through these issues it
could be -- they've got -- $100 billion is a rough estimate of some
of the work that were in the so-called tier two issues that were
being handled at the budget advisors level.  That's where it has come
from.

     Now, if you look at some of the other issue areas -- the
so-called tier three issues -- where they've identified some
agreement in policy approaches, they've got considerably more than
that, I would guess.  But I can't put a dollar figure on that, nor
should I, because it's subject to further discussion.  And in any
event, as we've said all along again, they have to get agreement on a
whole package before it all matters.

     Q  Tier two is what?  Tier two is nonentitlement,
discretionary --

     MR. MCCURRY:  Tier one -- they've defined issues as they
worked at both the staff and budget advisor issues as tier one, tier
two, tier three issues, as they rank order some of the policy
questions.  And just, for example, in the area of revenues I think
there were, what, Barry -- 70 separate issues that they needed to
examine.

     Now, they range from -- tier one would be something
which there is a common approach both in the balanced budget act, in
the President's approach on policy terms that's reflected in some of
the other discussion documents they've looked at, whether it's
Breaux-Chafee, whether it's Daschle, whether it's the coalition
budget, that there's some commonality approach and they think they
can lock in language that would satisfy everybody.  So, in other
words, a done deal; it looks like that will be easy to do.

     Tier two are areas where there are differences, but
they're fairly close.  They can be significant policy issues, but
there are ways in which you could bridge the gaps.  And they
concentrated a lot of work on the tier two issues.  And I think
that's where they found agreement that would take you beyond this
mythical $100 billion that was reported somewhere today.

     And then tier three issues are the more fundamental
differences that really are central to getting final agreement.  And
as I say, those are ones in which they agree to sharpen up the
discussion by really looking for how you define and analyze the
tradeoffs that would have to happen in order to reconcile those two
or three issues.  But that's work that will have to go on on Tuesday.

     Q  Does it have to be balanced down to a penny?  I
mean, it has to be actually -- the numbers have to be coinciding
totally?

     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, they -- it's more -- the more
important issue and then more of these discussions have been around
the policy has to be agreed to, how do you -- what's the policy going
to be.

     Q  Are tax cuts on the table?

     MR. MCCURRY:  Tax relief for working families has always
been on the table.

     Q  I didn't ask that.  I asked would tax cuts --

     Q  When this is all finished, for each of the major
topics they talked about will there be a figure for each of seven
fiscal years that will be the limit leading to a zero deficit?


     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, when it's all said and done and they
have a final agreement they will have a document that then can be
scored by CBO that could produce that type of analysis, sure.

     Q  Going back to -- can you characterize at all this
-- without the figure, what kind of subject areas there are
agreement?  How will you characterize the areas they have agreement
on?  You don't want to do it money-wise.  Subject-wise, anything
besides --

     MR. MCCURRY:  No, that's a -- I mean, substantively
we're not -- that just is more fuel for a lot of incorrect
speculation.  And as the Speaker made the point today, that it has
helped them that they've not tried to score points in the public
discussion of these deliberations.

     Q  I just want to clarify -- if, for purpose of
discussion the President is talking about CBO assumptions in all of
these discussions, is he then acquiescing to CBO's growth
predictions, its interest rate predictions?

     MR. MCCURRY:  Not necessarily.  I mean, that might be
that the issue of how you define assumption, will look at assumptions
-- and more importantly, how you decided when certain budget features
would trigger on or trigger off.

     Q  I'm sorry, could you run that past me one more
time?  You're saying he is not in agreement with the CBO --

     MR. MCCURRY:  I said that -- the question is about
assumptions, has he agreed to lock in the CBO assumptions.  I think
that's still an area that the principals could explore as they look
at issues like when certain budget features trigger on, trigger off,
how you measure that and how you look at impact.  For purposes of
these discussions they have agreed to a CBO evaluation on what the
budget options are.  I'm not going to get any more specific than what
I just said, although I just gave you a very good hint.

     Q  In talking about Medicare today and trying to talk
about their differences of viewpoint on medical inflation, what are
they -- whose numbers are they utilizing?

     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, for an informed discussion they use
-- they were relying on budget experts at CBO, at HHS, they were
looking at different types of analysis.

     QQ  Oh, this is the last tier thing where if you save
money on discretionary in the last years then you have to trigger
off, based on if you beat the CBO assumptions?

     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, trigger-on, trigger-off is an aspect
of various budget proposals that are out there.  There are some in
the coalitions, there is one in the President's most recent offer.

     Q  What's he going to do at Hilton Head?

     MR. MCCURRY:  In Hilton Head he's looking forward to
seeing his friends, first and foremost; spending time with his
family; having dinner with his friends tonight and spending some time
outdoors tomorrow.  It's been raining --

     Q  What time do you expect --

     Q  Mike, will he say anything on going out to the
helicopter?


     MR. MCCURRY:  No, I think he wants to just get down
there and see his friends and have New Year's Eve with people he's
spent New Year's Eve with for the last 12 years.

     All right, happy New Year, everybody.  Have a safe and
prosperous 1996.

     Q  Did they all wish each other a happy New Year?

     MR. MCCURRY:  They did.  Actually, they said goodbye to
each other, happy New Year to each other.  There was a little bit of
discussion about travel plans for everybody.  I think, as you know,
Senator Dole after the senate session is going up to New Hampshire.


     Q  Did the President wish him well?

     MR. MCCURRY:  There was some good natured discussion.
He's going for the first eve festivities, or something like that.  I
would say that there continues to be a good atmosphere in these
discussions, but everybody is realistic enough to know that there are
sharp differences that still exist and that there's a lot of hard
work ahead.

     Q  Any idea when they're going to actually be done
with any sort of an agreement on the seven-year plan -- to they have
a time -- can't do it by Wednesday?

     MR. MCCURRY:  No, I think -- I think that everyone
understands -- the President is very cognizant of the Speaker's
concern about doing this within the statutory calendar of the first
session.  In fact, the President, at several points when it was
suggested there's going to be a lot of work that would have to be
done to get this discussion document together, that it might not be
done by Tuesday, the President admonished everybody again and said it
was very hard to ask people to work on the holiday.  But that because
of the Speaker's concern about January 3rd and that date, that it was
important to have a meeting during the day on Tuesday, even if it had
to be late in the day.  So we understand the importance of that and
that's why everyone is committed to trying to work this through as
quickly as they can.

     Q  Do you think there will be meetings between the
principals Wednesday, Thursday -- every day until there's --

     MR. MCCURRY:  I can't predict.  I'm taking it a day at a
day.  I'll tell you what I know, they plan to meet Tuesday night and
we'll see where we go from there.

     Q  So they have until midnight Wednesday night,
Thursday morning -- or is that --

     MR. MCCURRY:  Well, that's not -- I want to make it
clear that's not a -- that's a date that's important to the Speaker,
for reasons that the Speaker can tell you because it relates to the
statutory deadline of the first session, and it also relates to the
continuing resolution issue.  But I think we need -- you know, from
our point of view we just need to continue to work to try to resolve
the issues and do it as expeditiously as possible.

     Q  Is it midnight Tuesday or midnight Wednesday --

     MR. MCCURRY:  You should ask the House Speaker.  It's
their deadline, not ours.

     Thank you.

             END                          1:00 P.M. EST

ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY (OAU)

     The organization of African Unity (OAU) was established on May
25, 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia for the purpose of: 1) promoting
unity and solidarity among African States, 2) intensifying and
coordinating efforts to improve living standards, 3) defending the
sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence of African
states, 4)eradicating colonialism, and 5) promoting international
cooperation, in keeping with the United Nations Charter.
     Membership: Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso,
Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad,
Comoros, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,
Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali,
Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda,
Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia,
Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia,
Zimbabwe.
     Organization: There are four main organs of the OAU.  The
Assembly of Heads of State and Government, which meets in rotating
countries, is the highest authority.  The Council of Ministers,
comprised of foreign ministers from the member countries, meets on
a bi-annual basis, elects its own chairman each session, and
prepares the Assembly meetings.  The Secretariat General is the
permanent headquarters of the OAU.  Its Secretary General is
elected to a four-year term by the Assembly.  The final OAU organ
is the Council of Mediation, Councilitation and Arbitration, which
meets when necessary to hear and peacefully settle disputes between
member countries.  There are also several "specialized commissions"
attached to the OAU for economic, social, transport and
communications affairs; education, science, culture and health;
defense; human rights; and labor.
     Budget: Members contribute with their U.N. assessment.  No
member is assessed for an amount exceeding 20 percent of the
yearly regular OAU budget.
     Current Activities: At the 61st meeting of the OAU Council of
Ministers in late January, members concentrated on finding a
practical solution to the four-year-old Somali conflict by the end
of March when United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) is
scheduled to end.  Although no solutions were put forward,the
members resolved to hold two meetings, one ministerial and the
other at the summit level, in March to work out the details for
OAU to replace UNOSOM as the oversight body for Somalia.  The decision
is the second collective move by African countries toward the
Somali issue since the beginning of the year.  On January 4,
Africa's Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development
(IGADD) Committee called on all factions to avoid further
hostilities and bloodshed.
     OAU members view the resolution of the Somalia problem in
regional terms.  They stress that Africa's problems should be
solved by Africans.  OAU-mandated mediator, President Meles Zenawi
(Ethiopia) has stated that African nations have a better
understanding of the Somali social structure, mentality, and
relationships between clans than an outside force such as UNOSOM.

Therefore, African nations working in concert in the OAU enjoy
advantages in helping the Somalis solve their problems.  While no
one believes that the Somali conflict can be resolved in the near
future, there is great optimism among informed African Sources that
the OAU can begin to lay the foundation for a lasting peace.

WHO IS WHO IN BULGARIA

     By a vote of 138 to 91 with two abstentions, Zhan Videnov,
chairman of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) was elected prime
minister on January 25.  Soon after his confirmation, the 35-year
old Moscow-trained economist presented his cabinet to the
parliament for approval.  In spite of complaints by opposition
deputies that the new cabinet is populated with member of the
former communist elite, all ministers were approved.
     While it is true that the cabinet is dominated by former
senior communist officials, it also includes technocrats in some
key posts.  Videnov will be assisted by four deputy prime
ministers: Rumen Gechev, Doncho Konakchiev, Kiril Tsochev and
Svetoslav Shiravov.  The first three also have economic
portfolios,
with Gechev exercising overall control over the economy as
minister
for economic development.  Georgi Pirinski, who was deputy
foreign
trade minister under the Zhivkov regime but hails from the
reformist wing of the BSP, has been named foreign minister.
Historian Ilcho Dimitrov is the new minister of education - a
post
held in the 1980s.  Res. Adm. Dimiter Pavlov is the new defense
minister and Lyubomi Nachev, a former police officer, takes over
the Ministry of Interior.  The Ministry of Finance is headed by
Dimitar Kostov.  The BSP's coalition partners will hold three of
the 17 posts.  Svetoslav Shivarov and Vasil Chichibaba of the
Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union "Aleksandar Stambliyski" are
deputy prime minister and minister of agriculture, respectively,
and Georgi Georgiev of the Political Club Ekoglasnost is the
environment minister.
     In his speech as prime minister, Videnov announced an "anti-
crisis program" and pledged to cut unemployment and inflation.
He
said the new government will also speed up privatization and
agricultural reform while continuing to develop ties with
international lending organizations.  With regard to foreign
policy, Videnov said his government will promote Bulgaria's
integration into Europe and continue to take part in NATO's
Partnership for Peace program.  He promised to present a
four-year
legislative plan within 100 days and said the 1995 budget would
be
approved by the end of March.

LEBANON'S PRESIDENTIAL RACE TO BEGIN IN MARCH

     The race for Lebanon's presidency is expected to begin in
March when the parliament will be able to consider introducing
constitutional amendments that would make it possible for
President Elias Hrawi to run for a second term. The current 
constitution does not allow an incumbent president to be
reelected or a civil servant to run for president if he did
not resign from his post two years before the polls. Amendments 
to these two articles will be considered.
     Even though Hrawi has recently stated that he does not want to
run for another six-year term, information out of Syria, and from 
within the Lebanese ruling establishment suggests that he would be 
reelected with little difficulty. If the law which prohibits civil 
servants rom running for office is repealed, Army Commander Gen. Emile 
Lahoud has been mentioned as a strong candidate.

IRAQI LEADER'S SON REPORTEDLY APPOINTED INTELLIGENCE CHIEF

     Citing reliable sources, a Kurdistan newspaper reported on
February 10 that Abd Hasan al-Majid, the director of the General
Intelligence, has been replaced by Qusayy Saddam, the son of
Saddam Hussein.  Qusayy was last referred to as the chief of the Special
Security Organization (Jihaz Amn al-Khass), President Saddam's
personal secret service.
     Al-Majid was apparently sacked in connection with
revelations concerning several Iraqi assassination operations against such
targets as German Journalist Lisi Schmidt in Kurdistan and Ghalib
al-Suhayl, a leading Iraqi opposition figure, in Lebanon.  It is
curious to note that this was the same reason given for the
removal of al-Majid's predecessor, Maj. Gen. Sabir al-Duri in June, a
move generally regarded as a part of widespread purge of the al-Duri
family from the Iraqi leadership.

expansion of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Pakistan's domestic
intelligence service, on January 28, creating 24 new posts at
levels below grade 20.(The News, January 29)  The move was taken
to broaden the agency's network and invigorate its anti-terrorist
activities.  According to informed sources, however, the
expansion has not yet received the consent of the Ministry of Finance 
or the Establishment Division, which must approve any financial or
administrative change in IB's status.

RAO RESHUFFLES INDIA'S CABINET

     Prime Minister Narasimha Rao expanded the Council of
Ministers on February 9, inducting three new ministers of cabinet rank,
three as ministers of state, and elevated two ministers of state to the
cabinet rank.  He also reallocated the portfolios of some other
ministers.  This reshuffle, which was the second since Rao came
to power in 1991, was designed to resuscitate a cabinet depleted by
a string of sackings and resignations following the ruling Congress
party's defeats in regional polls last November.(See WGR, Vol
4.,No2)
     Two appointments stand out.  Rao has recalled Madhav Rao
Scindia, an Oxford educated scion of the ruling family Gwalir and
loyal Congress party stalwart, to be minister of human resources
development.  Scindia quit as civil aviation minister in January
1993 after accepting moral responsibility for the crash of a
Russian aircraft leased by the government-owned Indian Airlines.
The other major appointment is P. Chidambaram as a minister of
state for commerce.  A Harvard-educated lawyer and former home,
personnel and commerce minister, Chidambaram is widely admired in
industry for his strong advocacy of India's economic reform
program.

INDONESIAN PRESIDENT APPOINTS ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF

     President Suharto installed Gen. Raden Hartono as Army chief
of staff on February 11, replacing Gen. Wismoyo Arismunandar, who
retired the day before.  As a 1962 graduate of the National
Military Academy, Hartono is senior to Wismoyo, who graduated in
1963.  Hartono, 53, however, is two years younger that his
predecessor, for he was the youngest graduate in his class.
     Officially, the 55-year old Wismoyo, the president's
brother-in-law, chose to retire because he has reached the military age
of retirement.  But Suharto could have kept him on until he was 60.
Gen. Fesal Tanjung, 57, chief of the Joint Service and commander-
in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia (ABRI),
has had his retirement deferred twice.  According to informed
sources, the president's decision not to extend Wismoyo's service
is related to the latter's tumultuous private life, which has
irritated his extended family.  And in order to show his
independence, he has at times shown more solidarity with the Army
than Suharto might have liked.  Having turned down an
ambassador's post, Wismoyo will become head of the National 
Indonesian Sports Committee.
     Wismoyo's retirement will not weaken Suharto's position
within the military.  The appointment of Hartono, considered to a be a
loner in the Army, reflects the president's desire to surround
himself with officers who owe their positions solely to him.
Before his recent appointment, Hartono was the chief of the Armed
Forces Sociological Department.  The son of a Muslim religious
scholar from Pamedasan, Madura, he held several senior posts in
the ABRI.  After his tenure as commander of the Brawijaya Regional
Military Command in East Java, he was appointed commandant of the
Army Command and Staff College (Bandung).  He then served as
governor of the National Defense Institute.

NORTH KOREAN LEADER FAILS TO APPEAR AT BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION

     On February 16, North Korea began a two-day celebration of
Kim Chong-il's 53rd birthday in what is believed to be a prelude to
his formal assession to power in the spring.  Kim, living up to his
reputation as a recluse, failed to make an appearance at the
festivities.  This did not stop the celebration from being
officially proclaimed as the "greatest holiday of nation," a
title that used to be formally reserved for the April 15 Birthday of
Kim's father, the late President Kim Il-sung.
     Kim Chong-il's avoidance of the lime-light since his
father's death last July has fed speculation that he was ill, which was
delaying his formal takeover of the two key posts of national
president and secretary general of the Korean Worker's Party.  In
the past six weeks, however, he has made four public appearances,
seemingly in better health than last summer when the emaciated
Kim appeared to suffer from facial paralysis.  Although these recent
appearances have laid to rest speculation about poor health, they
raised new questions whether Kim is engaged in a political
struggle with hardline elements within the high command since all were
liked to military events.
     According to informed South Korean sources, Kim wants to
extend the period of mourning for this father in order to
increase public acceptance of his succession.  One indication that he may
take power in Late April is the staging at that time of an
international sports and cultural festival in Pyongyang to which
10,000 foreign guests have been invited.  The event will most
likely also correspond with his father's embalmed body being
brought to its final resting place in the capital, which would
formally end the mourning period.

SOUTH KOREAN ARMY RELEASES REFORM PLAN

     In early February, the ROK Army revealed its plan for
drastic reorganization and downsizing of its headquarter.(Hangyore
Sinmun, February 3)  According to the plan, which was apparently overseen
by Chief of the General Staff Yun Yongnam, around two-thirds of
the officers attached to the present headquarters will be
transferred, many to field army staffs and educational institutes, such 
as the National Defense college and Military Staff College.
     The Army plans to merge the posts of Assistant Chief of
Staff for Information and the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations
in order to streamline the General Staff bureaucracy.  In another
move, several independent administrative branches of the Army
will be reduced.  The Office of Communication and the Office of
Adjutant Generals will be incorporated into the Assistant Chief of Staff
for Logistics.  The Office of Personnel Management may also be
abolished for it overlaps with the duties of the Assistant Chief
of Staff for Personnel.

THAILAND'S FOREIGN MINISTER ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION

     Thaksin Shinawatra, one of Thailands's most successful
businessmen, announced his resignation as minster of foreign
affairs on January 31 after a controversy involving potential
conflict of interest with his business empire.  He said that he
would resign before the end of February when a constitutional
tribunal is scheduled to rule on whether he can legally hold the
government portfolio.
     Thaksin, who is not an elected member of parliament, was
offered the foreign affairs post in November when Prime Minster
Chamlong Srimuang, the leader of the Palang Dharma party, sacked
all 11 of his party's ministers to try to boost its flagging
popularity.  Critics criticized the prime minister for giving
such a delicate job to an aggressive entrepreneur who had built up his
company (Shinawatra Telecommunications Group) on his ability to
win contracts for Thai and foreign governments.  Thaksin's position
was made more difficult in December when the legislature passed a new
constitution that banned ministers from holding government
monopoly concessions.(Financial Times, February 1)  He refused to divest
his more than $2 billion worth of shares in the Shinawatra group
which owns the country's two commercial satellites and a mobile phone
concession.  On becoming foreign minister, he resigned as
chairman of his flagship Shinawatra Computer and Communications group but
simply passed the reins to his wife.  This was not thought enough
to distance him from the corporate empire.  Under constant
pressure for critics inside and outside the government, Thaksin decided to
give up his government work and return to the private sector.
     Because of his short tenure, Thaskin's departure is unlikely
to disrupt Thai foreign policy.  Most of the more innovative
policies, covering cross-border economic cooperation, have been
overseen by Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panichpakdi.  As for
Thaksin's successor, the new foreign minister will probably be a
Palang Dharma MP.  Although there are few qualified candidates,
informed sources point to Krasae Chanawong, the current
university minster.

RESIGNATION OF FINANCE MINSTER CALLS INTO QUESTION HUNGARY'S
COMMITMENT TO REFORM

     Prime Minister Gyula Horn on February 7 nominated Budapest
Bank President Lajos Bokoros as minister of finance and Gyorgy
Suranyi, current head of the Central European International Bank,
as Hungarian National Bank Chairman.  The nomination of two
respected bankers is designed to restore confidence in Hungary's
financial management structure which was undermined by Finance
Minister Laszlo Bekesi's resignation on January 30.
     Bekesi, the architect of the Socialist party's economic
reform program, resigned after a long battle with government hardliners
over control of privatization.  Coming just two weeks after the
sacking of another prominent reformer, Privatization Chief Ferenc
Bartha, and a two month delay in naming a new central bank
governor, Bekesi's resignation cast doubt on the government's
commitment to economic reform.  In addition, his departure
reflected a growing strain within the ruling coalition.
     The uneasy ruling coalition, which was formed last July
between the Socialist party and the Alliance of Free Democrats
(ADF), began to show signs of serious disagreement over economic
policy almost from its inception.  The ADF, which is composed of
refugees from the former dissident movement, prefers market
reform and rapid privatization of state industries.  The Socialist
party, made up of reform elements of the former communist party,
however, prefers market reform and rapid privatization of state
industries. The Socialist party, made up of reform elements of the 
former communist party, however, prefers a slower pace to economic
reform and is not enthusiastic about widespread privatization.  The
tension between the two parties increase dramatically in January
with signs that Socialist Prime Minister Gyula Horn, whose ruling
style has become progressively more autocratic, had decided to
slow the pace of reform.  Bartha, who was the finance ministry's
ostensibly independent privatization commissioner, was seen as a
threat because he answered to Bekesi and not the prime minister's
office.  His sacking spurred ADF protests that the Socialists
were abandoning the coalitions's agreed economic program for the
steady transformation of the country's economic system.  Horn was also
criticized for not sufficiently consulting his coalition partners
before making policy decisions.
     In an attempt to repair the damage caused by Bekesi's
resignation, the two ruling parties agreed on February 14 to
appoint a new minister without portfolio to supervise
privatization.  The two parties also agreed to extend the
authority of the finance minister, giving him veto power over all
economic proposals forwarded to the government, a responsibility that
Bekesi had requested.  The ADF originally opposed creating the new post
and wanted the finance minister to supervise privatization.  The
extension of the finance minister's authority was a compromise
solution.

POLISH PRESIDENT FORCES CABINET'S RESIGNATION

     On February 6, President Lech Walesa called for the
resignation of Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and reshuffle of
the coalition government composed of the ex-communist Left Democratic
Alliance (SLD) and Pawlak's own Peasant Party (PSL).  Walesa
accused Pawlak of incompetence and said his government was making
little progress in reforming the country.  Three days later,
Pawlak in a speech before the PSL executive committee announced that he
would resign after the formation of a new government.  Walesa has
given preliminary backing to Speaker of the Parliament Jozef
Olesky, a compromise candidate from the SLD, to become the fifth
Polish prime minister in the post-communist era.
     Political and personality conflicts have plagued the
coalition since its creation in 1993, in particular between Alexander
Kwasniewski, the pragmatic SLD leader, and Prime Minister Pawlak.

Walesa, for whom the prospect of a long-term, stable government
led by his former communist opponents meant relegation to virtual
irrelevance, was quick to seize upon the internal stresses to
undermine the coalition.  By delaying the appointment of the
heads of the "power ministries" (defense, internal and foreign
affairs), he has campaigned to erode the government's efficacy.  Following
the resignation or sacking of all three ministers in the last few
months, none of the portfolios have been filled.  In addition,
Walesa in recent weeks has sought to drive a wedge between Pawlak
and Kwasniewski, denigrating the former and pointing to the
virtues of the latter as a potential prime minister.
     Walesa's actions are directly linked to his plans to seek a
second-five-year term in November.  Politically isolated by a
parliament in which he has few allies and which was elected in
1993 for a four-year term, the president decided that his political
survival was based on his ability to win the non-communist right
behind his candidacy.
     Pawlak's resignation may, however, prove to be a pyrrhic
victory.  For, while agreeing to replace the prime minister, the
PSL refused to nominate Kwasniewski as Wales had suggested.
Since Kwasniewski is regarded as one of the main potential contenders
for the presidency in November, his diversion into the premiership
would have removed a major obstacle to Walesa's reelection.
Instead, the PSL opted for Jozef Olesky, an intelligent and
deeply cynical former communist turned pro-market reformer.  Olesky is
openly contemptuous of Wales who he describes as the "proletarian
president."  An SLD-led government under his control would be
more efficient and less amenable presidential sabotage, leaving
Kwasniewski free to run against Walesa as the candidate of the
left.

RUSSIA MAY CREATE NATIONAL GUARD

     President Boris Yeltsin's advisers are preparing to
establish a National Guard directly subordinate to the president's
office.(Izvestiya, January 24)  According to informed sources,
the guard will be used during times of turmoil as "an armed
organization that will be an instrument in the battle for
political power."  In periods of stability, the National Guard will be an
"armed pillar of the political leader of the state."  Its
responsibilities will mostly revolve around internal problems and
threats which are outside the army's jurisdiction.  Its
membership will be small, but elite.  Aleksandr Korzhakov, chief of the
Presidential Guard, is said to be the main force behind the
guards' creation.  The idea for it sprang from an "analytical center"
under his control which employs between 60 and 100 former KGB experts
and headed by Georgii Pagozin, Korzhakov's deputy.  If reports of the
creation of yet another internal security force is true, they add
to the increasing evidence that Korzhakov is exercising a
hardline influence on the president.

RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY RESHUFFLED

     President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on January 19
appointing new deputy defense ministers as part of a shakeup of
the Ministry of Defense.  Civilian Andrei Kokoshin retained his
position as first deputy minister as did chief of the General
Staff Col. Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov.  Deputy ministers Col. Gen.
Konstantin Kobets, the inspector general of the armed forces and
Col. Gen. Vladimir Toporov, who had been in charge of logistics,
also retained their posts.  Toporov was described in the decree
as a deputy minister without portfolio, although subsequent reports
have stated that such tasks as physical fitness training and
cultural and recreational activities will fall under his purview.

Col. Gen. Anatolii Solomatin, chief of construction and billeting
for the armed forces, and Col. Gen. Vladimir Churanov, chief of
rear services, became deputy ministers for construction and
billeting and logistical support, respectively.
     As expected, Col. Gen. Boris Gromov, Col. Gen. Georgii
Kondratyev and Col. Gen. Valerii Mironov were not reappointed,
nor was previously dismissed Col. Gen. Matvei Burlakov.  It is clear
that their removal was linked to their negative attitude to
Russian operations in Chechnya.  While Kondratyev and Mironov were
"assigned to other duties," presumably within the Ministry of
Defense, Gromov was appointed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
as the "chief military expert at large."  He is to serve as a
liaison between the two ministries as well as handle issues relating to
relations with NATO, strategic stability in Europe, and military
cooperation between CIS countries.
     In the wake of the debacle in Chechnya, rumors have begun to
surface concerning an new purge of the high command aimed at
Minister of Defense Gen. Pavel Grachev and his immediate circle
of advisers.  The Kremlin is said to be unhappy with his handling of
the war, which he promised would be over soon.  The Security
Council is particularly angry that Grachev has disclaimed
responsibility, shifting blame to it.  Andrei Kokoshin is being
considered for the minister's post, while Col. Gen. Andrei
Nikolayev, presently chief of the Federal Border Service, is
apparently a strong candidate for the post of Chief of the

April.

NEW ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF APPOINTED IN CONGO

     President Pascal Lissouba appointed Gen. Daniel Mabika as
chief of the Army staff of the Congolese Armed forces (FAC) on
January 23.  Mabika succeeds Gen. Claude-Emmanuel Etat-Onka, who
was appointed on the same day as minster of sports in the
country's new government.  Trained in the former Soviet Union, Gen. Mabika
had since 1985 been chief of operations of the FAC headquarter,
thus making him Gen. Etat-Onka's first deputy.  The new
government is expected to reorganize the armed forces in the near future, as
well as the police and gendarmerie.  The militias of the various
political parties will be dismantled.

AFTER FOILING COUP PLOT, GAMBIA'S LEADER PROMOTES ALLIES

     Capt. Yahya Jammeh, Gambia's military leader, promoted
Defense Minister Lt. Edward Singhateh to vice president and former
Western Division Commissioner Capt. Lamin Bajo to interior minister after
a purge of hardliners from the ruling council on January 30.(AFP,
January 30)  The reshuffle came in response to an alleged coup
attempt three days earlier by Vice President Lt. Sana Sabally and
Minister of Interior Capt. Sadibu Haidara.  Sabally and Haidara
have been arrested and are confined to Banjul's Mile Two prison.
     The dramatic events occurred as a commission was due to
publish its report on a timetable for the return to civilian
rule. Jammeh, who toppled civilian leader Sir Dawda Jawara last July,
unleashed a storm of protest in November when he said he did not
plan to hand over power until the end of 1998.  But in response
to international and local pressure, he set up a civilian commission
to canvass opinion and make a recommendation on the transfer of
power.  The commission recommended that the Armed forces
Provisional Council relinquish power by July 1996 and appoint an
interim government headed by a civilian prime minister, with
Jammeh remaining as head of state.  Hardliners within the Council, led
by Sabally and Haidara opposed the early transfer of power, wishing
to extend the present form of government to at least 1998.

NIGERIAN CABINET DISSOLVED

     Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya, the number two person in the Nigerian
government, announced on February 9 that military ruler Gen. Sani
Abacha had dissolved the cabinet in order to allow some minister
to enter active politics.  The ministers are seeking to run for
office under a program for the military government's transition to
democratic rule which is yet to be announced.(Reuters, February
9) In light of an apparent narrowing of support for Abacha within
the military and a recent Constitutional Conference's decision to
force a transition within on year, many of the more ambitious ministers
are eager to establish their individual political credentials.
Diya said that a new cabinet will be named after a meeting of the
ruling all-military Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) but did not
indicate when it would meet.
     In the wake of last year's opposition attempt to force
Abacha to cede power to Moshood Abiola, the businessman widely believed
to have won an annulled 1993 presidential vote, Gen. Abacha promised
to make major changes in the government to make it more
effective. He also promised to announce a new transitional program that
would conclude with elections and a return to civilian rule.  A
Constitutional Conference was convened in Abuja to consider these
questions.  In december, the Conference stunned the government by
announcing that the military should turn over the reins of power
by January 1, 1996.  Almost immediately, the government began
lobbying to overturn the decision.  Conference delegates were courted and
envoys were sent abroad to explain that a quorum was not present
when the hand over vote was taken.  The Conference reconvened on
January 9, it decided to adjourn proceedings for two months thus
delaying the submission of its constitutional report to the
government and setting back the timetable for the unbanning of
political parties and fresh elections.  Even though Abacha was
successful in stifling the conference's attempt to enforce a
schedule for transition to civilian rule, the episode revealed
the limited amount of political loyalty he enjoys.
     In the midst of this leadership crisis, 14 of the 32-member
cabinet have signified their intention to quit the government to
pursue political careers.  All of these ministers belong to the
two political parties that vied for power after former military ruler
Gen. Ibrahim Babangida's promised transition to civil rule, which
led to Abacha a coming to power.  They are not keen to be linked
to an increasingly unpopular government and want to be free to from
their own alliances before it is too late.  Two of the more
notable politicians in the cabinet are Baba Gana Kingibe, foreign
minister, and Lateef Jakande, works minister, who have both run for
president in the past.
     As Nigeria attempts to establish a foreign exchange market,
crucial to the operation of the import-dependent economy, and
prepares for the start of a two-week international soccer
tournament in March, it is important that the government put this
crisis behind it as soon as possible.  Gen. Diya in his statement
announcing the dissolution of the cabinet said that outgoing
ministers who were not politicians could be considered for
reappointment. This indicates that Abacha will most likely not
use the cabinet reshuffle to stack the cabinet with proteges, which
would reveal an intention to abandon his promise to turn over
power to a civilian government.

NEW POLICE COMMISSIONER APPOINTED IN SOUTH AFRICA

     President Nelson Mandela announced the appointment of Gen.
George Fivaz as the new national commissioner of the South
African Police Services (SAP) on January 29.  Fivaz succeeds Gen. Johan
van der Merwe, who announced his retirement earlier this month.  In
addition, four new deputy commissioners were appointed: Gen.
Morgan Chetty, Gen. Mike Bester, Gen. Zolisa Lavisa and Gen. John
Manuel. 
     Gen. Fivaz's appointment came as little surprise , for he
has no connection with the SAP security apparatus responsible for the
enforcement of apartheid.  In fact, he has a reputation as a
reformer.  Having joined the SAP in 1964, he began his career as
a police officer at Bayswater in Bloemfontein.  In 1972, he was
appointed branch commander of the South African Narcotics Bureau
in the Orange Free State.  Four years later, he became a member of
the SAP National Inspectorate where he developed a particular
interest in policing styles, including community policing.  As chief of
Division Efficiency Services, he has played a critical role in
decentralizing authority within the national police force and
restructuring the SAP.

FRENCH SOCIALISTS FIND A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

     The French Socialist party (PS) had an embarrassingly
difficult search for a presidential candidate after the
withdrawal of former EU President Jacques Delors from the race.  They
rebounded on February 5, overwhelmingly approving the nomination
of Lionel Jospin to represent the party in preliminary elections on
April 23.  Jospin, a 57-years old former education minister,
defeated PS First Secretary Henri Emanuelli with two-thirds of
the PS delegate votes.  In what will probably remain a three-man
race, Jospin is hoping to defeat Gaullist mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac
and himself face frontrunner and current Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur in the final round on May 7.  Early polls released on
February 15, put the Socialist candidate one point ahead of
Balladur.

     Irish junior Finance Minster Phil Hogan offered his
resignation in parliament on February 9 in a controversy over the
leaking of the government's annual budget statement.  Opposition
Fianna Fail ministers had demanded Hogan's resignation, accusing
him of divulging market sensitive information.  Hogan admitted
that part of the budget was faxed from his office to newspapers almost
four hours before it was to be made public by Minister of Finance
Ruairi Quinn.

ITALIAN PRIME MINISTER WINS NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE

     Former Central Bank Director Lamberto Dini took the helm of
the 54th post World War II Italian government, having been
confirmed by the Senate by a margin of 191-17 with two
abstentions on February 3.  However, 114 senators backing media magnate
turned politician  Silvio Berlusconi chose not to be present at the
vote, demonstrating tepid support for the new government.  On January
26, Dini survived a no-confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies by
a margin of 302 in favor, 270 abstentions and 39 against.  The new
government bears all the indications of instability: it is
composed entirely of non-parliamentarians, had defined itself as a
transitional government and enjoys uncertain support.
     Ironically, Dini was endorsed by the enemies of the previous
rightwing government (in which Dini was finance minister) and
opposed by Dini's erstwhile Forza Italia  allies.  The Party of
the Democratic Left, the Democratic Alliance and the Northern League,
wanted to avoid early elections, while the Forza Italia faction
insisted on but did not get a fixed date for elections.

NEW LEADERS FOR THE EU AND LUXEMBOURG

     On January 23, the first new EU president in 10 years,
Jacques Santer, presided over a new European Commission in Brussels.
He is expected to carry out the mandates of the Maastrict Treaty:
consolidating the single market, advancing the European monetary
system, and fashioning common foreign and defense policies.  More
important may be his ability to adapt EU edicts to the changing
times, a logic which will be exercised in the 1996
Intergovernmental Conference, designed to amend the 1991
Maastrict Treaty.  Finally, he will be required to formulate an expansion
policy for new members and policies of engagement for non-EU
Europe.
     Succeeding Santer as head of the government of Luxembourg,
Jean-Claude Juncker took the reins as prime minister on January
21. The 40-year old former finance and labor minister pledged to
continue the work of Santer's Social Christian party.  He will
serve out the remainder of Santer's term, which ends in June
1999.

PORTUGAL'S PRIME MINISTER WITHDRAWS FROM NEXT ELECTIONS

     On January 24, the district and regional leaders of the
prime minister's Social Democrat (PSD) party met to choose a successor
to Anibal Cavaco Silva after he announced he would not run in
elections in October.  His government's popularity has fallen
prey to economic recession, projected loss of parliamentary majority,
and a scandal stemming from a state corporation's breach of the
embargo on Indonesia.
     The government drew a wave of anger when it was revealed on
January 22 that General Aeronautical Workshop's (OGMA) had
accepted a contract to repair Indonesian Air Force helicopter engines.
The contract violates 1992 trade sanctions against Indonesia for
abuses of the population of East Timor.  This is the second such case in
as many months, the first involving illegal OGMA cooperation with
Angolan government armed forces.
     Opposition Communist party chairman Carlos Carvalhas called
for the government to resign and petitioned President Mario
Alberto Soares to call for early elections, while the more moderate
Socialists encouraged avoiding hasty dismissals and appeared to
wait for the October election.  Defense Minister Fernando Nogeira
was called upon to resign but refused, and denied that repairing
the engines either harmed the East Timorese or affected their
cause.  The prime minister defended OGMA and his government,
declaring that no government had fought as hard as the Portuguese
in favor of the East Timorese cause.  Opinion polls indicate his
PSD is unlikely to win a majority in the next election.  A
January 26 poll has the Socialists at 44.8 percent of the vote and 
PSD at 39.8 percent.

SPANISH PRIME MINISTER RECEIVES CATALAN ENDORSEMENT

     On February 9, the Catalan coalition Convergencia i Unio
supported the current Gonzalez government remaining in office at
least until the conclusion of the Spanish EU presidency at the
end of this year.  Felipe Gonzalez's grip on power withstood an
onslaught of criticism stemming from a difficult scandal in
January.  On January 10, El Mundo produced evidence that the
government had secretly paid 200 million peseta (about $1.5
million) to the families of policemen serving terms for
involvement in anti-ETA death squads in Basque country.  Euskadi to
Askatasuna (ETA-Basque Homeland and Liberty) is a "terrorist" 
organization in operation since 1959. The Grupos Antiterroristas 
de Liberaction (GAL) were formed in 1983 to opposed ETA.  Both 
groups are illegal.
     Pressure mounted on Gonzalez to resign as the private sector
also started taking a dimmer view of this continued tenure.  But
the prime minister of 13 years filed libel suits against all
those who linked the government with the GAL.

REFORMISTS APPOINTED IN CUBAN RESHUFFLE

     Cuba reshuffled its cabinet on January 24, replacing several
veteran bureaucrats with younger, reform-minded technocrats.  The
shakeup, which removed two vice presidents and appointed six new
ministers, was designed to give fresh momentum to the economic
reforms being carried out by President Fidel Castro's government.
     Osvaldo Marinez, a 51-year old economist, replaces Antonio
Rodriguez Maurell as minister of economy and planning.  As head
of the economic commission of the National Assembly, Martinez had
played a prominent role in implementing recent reforms to
decentralize and revitalize the country's recession-hit economy.
Maurell, who also lost his vice president post, had previously
headed the now-abolished central planning board that ran Cuba's
economy while the country was still a member of the Soviet bloc
Comecon.
     The most intriguing appointment was that of Francisco
Soberon Valdes as president of the central bank.  He had previously
headed Acemex, a Liechtenstein-registered management group of 23
companies engaged in shipping and finance operations between Cuba and 18
other nations, including Japan, Greece, Norway and Netherlands.
Soberon is a former Ministry of Trade official who has negotiated
financing deals in Britain and Europe.  He replaced Hector
Rodriguez Llompart, a veteran member of Cuba's economic policy
team and former planning board chairman.
     Over the past 18 months, the Cuban government has moved to
open up more of the economy to foreign investment and market-
oriented reforms.  In addition to creating more flexibility in
the bureaucracy through purges and reshuffles, the Cuban leadership
also intends to cut state subsidies, reduce the government budget
deficit and encourage profitability in state companies.

NEW PRESIDENT TO RESHUFFLE URUGUAY'S HIGH COMMAND

     According to several reports, president elect Julio Maria
Sanguinetti will appoint new commanders-in-chief of the Army,
Navy and Air Force upon his inauguration on March 1.  News of the
reshuffle followed statements by the current military commanders
that they were willing to remain in their posts if no
replacements were announced in advance of the new administration. In
accordance with the Military Organic Law, the present military commander
could continue in their posts until February 1996.
     Sources close to both the incoming president and President
Luis Alberto Lacalle have stated that Gen. Juan Carlos Curutchet,
currently the commander of the 2nd Army Division, will replace
Lt. Gen. Daniel Eduardo Garcia Silva as commander-in-chief of the
Army. Rear Adm. Raul Risso will replace James Croates as commander-in-
chief of the Navy.  Gen. Mario Aguerrondo, currently air attache
in Uruguay's Washington embassy, will replace Brig. Gen. Raul

HAITI -- ELECTION UPDATE

     On February 4, the parliament sent a bill to President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide allowing new elections, a key step in Haiti's
return to democracy.  On February 5, the terms of office of the
entire 83-member Senate expired.  Also expiring were the terms of
137 mayors and 565 town council members.  Election officials
estimate that balloting can be organized within three months
after the election bill becomes law.  If Aristide signs the bill and
publishes in the official state gazette, a procedure necessary
for a bill to become law, elections can be held as early as May.  It
is unclear how Aristide will govern in the meantime with most of the
parliament disbanded.

9TH CIR. SAYS WORKER'S TRANSFER WAS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on July 13 affirmed a
trial court's ruling which denied the U.S. Postal Service's motion
for summary judgment in a suit over its refusal to allow an HIV-
positive worker to transfer from Mississippi to California so he
could obtain better health care services  (Buckingham v. United
States of America et al., 9th Cir., No. 91-56236).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Appellant Melvin Buckingham worked for several months in the
Columbus, MS, post office when in 1988 he applied for a transfer to
Los Angeles so that he could avail himself of better medical care
for persons with HIV conditions there.  Although his request was
granted by his Mississippi superiors, he discovered upon arriving
in California that the Los Angeles Post Office would not agree to
waive a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with its employees'
unions requiring one year of seniority before workers could seek a
transfer.

     Buckingham appealed the decision to the Equal Opportunity
Employment Commission (EEOC), where an administrative law judge
said the transfer was a reasonable accommodation under the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (the Act) and that the Postal Service's
one year seniority requirement conflicts with its obligations under
the act.  After the Postal Service rejected the ALJ's
recommendation, Buckingham filed suit in U.S. District Court for
California's Central District.

     U.S. District Court Judge Terry J. Hatter rejected the Postal
Service's arguments that transfers for medical treatment are not
required as a matter of law and that catering to Buckingham would
violate the rights of other employees who met seniority
requirements and were seeking transfers.  Ruling sua sponte, the
judge ordered that Buckingham be reinstated and awarded back pay.

     "Buckingham is not asking for a different job.  Nor is he
asking for a job that is not reasonably available under the Postal
Service's existing policies," said the Ninth Circuit in
affirmation.  "He is asking for the same job at a different
location.  It is not unreasonable under the Rehabilitation Act to
transfer Buckingham to a location where he can obtain better
medical treatment for his handicap."

     The panel's opinion by Senior U.S. Circuit Court Judge Warren
J. Ferguson said although qualified handicapped employees may be
able to perform the essential functions of their job, they are not
precluded from a reasonable accommodation to allow them to "(a)
enjoy the privileges and benefits of employment equal to those
enjoyed by non-handicapped employees or (b) pursue therapy or
treatment for their handicaps.  In other words, an employer is
obligated not to interfere, either through action or inaction, with
a handicapped employee's efforts to pursue a normal life."

     Although affirming the trial court's reasonable accommodation
ruling, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to allow the government
to challenge the assumptions that Buckingham could get better
medical care in Los Angeles and that he was or would be able to
perform the essential functions of his job.  The panel said Judge
Hatter erred in issuing his sua sponte ruling without allowing the
Postal Service to present opposing arguments on factual disputes
"which must be resolved in Buckingham's favor in order for him to
prevail."  The Ninth Circuit said the government did not receive
sufficient notice of Judge Hatter's potential entrance of summary
judgment.

     Buckingham is represented by Stuart Herman of Herman & Wallach
in Los Angeles.  The Postal Service is represented by U.S. Justice
Department attorney John P. Schnitker of Washington, DC.

CA SUP. CT. DENIES REVIEW OF RULING IN FAVOR OF IRWIN

     The California Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision issued
July 15, denied a request to review an appeals court ruling which
said Irwin Memorial Blood Bank (Irwin) met the industry's standard
of care by not using surrogate test procedures to screen blood in
November 1983  (Wilson v. Irwin Memorial Blood Bank, CA Sup. Ct.,
No. S032902).

     (The opposing briefs are available from Andrews Document
Access Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from
Pennsylvania.)

     On appeal to the high court, attorneys for plaintiff Cynthia
Watson maintained that the courts below wrongly refused to judge
the actions of Irwin based on those of other blood banks in
"similar circumstances."  Judging the defendant on the basis of
actions by blood banks not confronted with the high level of risk
Irwin faced during that period, they claimed, was inappropriate.

     Watson's appeal brief, filed May 19, argued that the trial
court jury which decided against her was incorrectly told to
consider her claims based on a jury instruction designed only for
use in cases of misdiagnosis or improper treatment choice by a
medical professional.  It also asked the high court to decide if
the exclusion of certain testimony by dermatologist Marcus Conant,
M.D., and biostatistician Byron Brown, M.D., was appropriate simply
because neither was a "blood banker and was therefore not qualified
to testify as to the standard of care for blood banks."

     Watson maintained that the underlying decision by the state's
First District Court of Appeal was in conflict with other state
appellate decisions by declaring that the "standard of practice is
conclusive proof of the standard of care."  Watson said the
replacement of her "same or similar circumstances" standard of care
theory "with a weighing of what the majority of blood banks across
the nation were doing, results in a comparison of Irwin with blood
banks which were not at any risk of AIDS through their blood."

     Watson cited the Colorado Supreme Court's 1992 ruling in
United Blood Services v. Quintana, in which it said a trial court
erred in excluding the testimony of Dr. Conant on behalf of a
similarly situated plaintiff.  Said the Quintana court, "If the
standard adopted by a practicing profession were to be deemed
conclusive proof of due care, the profession itself would be
permitted to set the measure of its own legal liability, even
though that measure might be far below a level of care readily
attainable through the adoption of practices and procedures
substantially more effective in protecting others against harm than
self-decreed standards of the profession."

     Holding that the appellant offered no proof that it "failed to
do something that...other blood bankers would have done in similar
circumstances," Irwin argued against review of the appellate
ruling, saying it posed no conflict with other California courts.

      The partial exclusion of testimony from Dr. Conant "was not
based on the fact that Dr. Conant had not run a blood bank,"
responds Irwin, but due to the fact that "he was not shown to be
familiar with the standard of care for blood banks in November 1983
or at any other time."

     "While petitioner's outside experts opined that Irwin should
have been doing 'more' about AIDS and doing it sooner, there was no
evidence that at that time any blood bank except Stanford was, in
fact, doing what they testified 'should' have been done by Irwin,
and not even Stanford was running the T-cell test on all the blood
used there," replied Irwin on June 8.  "One blood bank is not a
'great minority' of blood banks as urged by the petitioner...it is
just one blood bank."

     Allowing "ad hoc judgments by lay jurors aided by hindsight"
in professional malpractice cases, argued Irwin, would "thwart"
California public policy and "elevate the standards required of
medical professionals beyond the reasonable expectations of the
profession to strict liability regardless of fault."

     Wilson is represented by Fred Meis and Sarah Jane Burgess of
Meis & Burgess in San Francisco.  Irwin is counseled by Charles
Bond, Heather McKee and Stephanie Gandolfi of Charles Bond &
Associates in Berkeley, CA, with James Dillon and Thomas Manning of

NC JUDGE GRANTS AZT PATENT RIGHTS TO BURROUGHS WELLCOME

     A U.S. District Court Judge in New Bern, NC, on July 22
concluded a four-week trial over the patent rights to the AIDS drug
AZT by issuing a directed verdict on behalf of Burroughs Wellcome
Co., rejecting claims by two pharmaceutical firms who said they
should be allowed to sell their own versions of the drug because it
was developed under guidance of U.S. Government researchers
(Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Barr Laboratories Inc., Burroughs
Wellcome Co. v. Novopharm Ltd., Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Novopharm
Inc., ED NC, Nos. 91-41-CIV-4-H, 92-134-CIV-4-H, 92-156-CIV-4-H).

     Judge Malcom J. Howard's decision is expected to be appealed
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit by defendants
Barr Laboratories Inc. and Novopharm Ltd., each of whom were sued
by North Carolina-based Burroughs Wellcome when they announced
plans to begin selling generic versions of the drug based on the
premise that Burroughs Wellcome was not AZT's rightful patent
holder.

     "The court has felt for some time that United States law, as
applied in this case, dictates that Burroughs Wellcome scientists
were the sole inventors of AZT," stated Judge Howard from the
bench.  Burroughs and Barr sought a ruling from the judge after
only a handful of the more than 200 witnesses were called.  Barr
sought the ruling so that it could appeal Judge Howard's definition
of inventorship without having to pursue the costly trial.

     The defendants maintain that former National Institutes of
Health physicians Samuel Broder and Hiroaki Mitsuya completed the
key research which later allowed Burroughs Wellcome to apply AZT,
known generically as zidovudine and sold by Burroughs Wellcome as
Retrovir, for use in the fight against AIDS.

     While patients using AZT pay some $2,000 annually for the
drug, the New York-based Barr and Canadian Novopharm say they would
sell the drug for a fraction of that amount.  Burroughs Wellcome
holds that its researchers developed the drug and that it is
entitled to maintain the patent, which runs through 2005.

     Burroughs Wellcome is represented by Thomas F. Curnin of
Cahill, Gordon & Reindel in New York City, and locally by Mark Ash
of Smith, Anderson, Blunt, Dorsett, Mitchell & Jurnigan in Raleigh,
NC.  Representing Barr are Dan Webb and local attorney John A.J.
Ward of New Bern.  Novapharm is represented by Robert Green of
Chicago and Rudy Ashton, also of New Bern.

IN APP. CT. AFFIRMS DISMISSAL OF HEALTH BENEFITS BIAS SUIT

     The Indiana Court of Appeals on July 6 unanimously affirmed a
trial court decision which said the state's Civil Rights Commission
(ICRC) erred in ruling an employer had violated state law by
cutting health benefits available to an AIDS victim because the
local law is preempted by federal statutes, which then did not
prohibit such discrimination (Westhoven v. Lincoln Foodservice
Products, Inc., IN Ct. of Apps., 2nd Dist., No. 35A02-9206-CV-260).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     An attorney for the estate of Kenneth Westhoven says no appeal
is planned in the case, noting that such a claim would now be
prohibited by the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), which was
not in effect when defendant Lincoln Foodservice Products reduced
the maximum benefits allowed for AIDS-related illnesses under its
self-funded employee insurance program.  Westhoven, an industrial
engineer, filed an ICRC action against the firm in 1990 based on
the changes it made to the plan in 1988 which capped lifetime
benefits for AIDS at $50,000, while other employees were provided
a $1 million limit.

     The commission found Lincoln to be in violation of Indiana's
Civil Rights Law (ICRL).  Lincoln appealed the decision to a state
trial court, which reversed the ruling on the grounds that the
state law is preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (ERISA).

     "Pursuant to the ADA, and Indiana's companion legislation,
Lincoln is presently prohibited from discriminating upon the basis
of a handicap, i.e., against a 'qualified individual with a
disability,' in a wide range of employment practices," said the
appellate decision.  "At the time of the alleged discrimination,
however, Lincoln was not bound by the ADA.  This is true
notwithstanding the fact that the ICRL pre-dated parallel
provisions of federal law which now control."

     Because ERISA preempts the state's civil rights laws,
concluded the appeals court, "the Commission was without
jurisdiction to proceed upon Westhoven's complaint alleging
discrimination in the terms, conditions, and privileges of
employment."

     Lincoln is represented by Thomas Kimbrough and David Steiner
of Barrett & McNagny of Fort Wayne, IN.  The estate is represented
by Richard Swanson of Macey, Macey and Swanson in Indianapolis.

AL CT. SAYS BLOOD SHIELD LAW BARS PRODUCT-LIABILITY SUIT

     Ruling that the supply of blood coagulant is considered a
service and not the sale of a product in the state, an Alabama
circuit court on June 8 granted defense motions to dismiss product
liability-based claims filed against two pharmaceutical firms by a
man who says their factorate products infected him with the AIDS
virus (Watkins v. Armour Pharmaceutical Co. et al., AL Cir. Ct.,
Calhoun Cty., No. CV-92-452).

     (The order is available from Andrews Document Access Service.
Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Plaintiff Richard D. Watkins, who now has AIDS, received blood
products manufactured by defendants Armour Pharmaceutical Co. and
Miles, Inc. while hospitalized at Northeast Alabama Regional
Medical Center in 1982, 1983, and 1984.  His suit charged the
pharmaceutical firms with strict liability in tort on the grounds
that the blood products they processed and provided him were
unreasonably dangerous and defective because they were contaminated
with the AIDS virus.

     The defendants suggested, and Circuit Court Judge Malcom B.
Street Jr. agreed, that such a suit is barred by Alabama's Blood
Shield Statute (Code Sec. 7-2-314[4]), which says that despite
remuneration to the provider, the supply of "human whole blood,
plasma, blood products, blood derivatives...is declared not to be
a sale...."

     Ruled the court, "this 'blood shield statute' clearly states
that the actions of defendants Armour, Miles and Northeast Alabama
Regional Medical Center in furnishing and distributing Factor VIII
blood products to the plaintiff were a service provided to the
plaintiff, Watkins.  The transaction of which the plaintiffs
complain is expressly declared by the statute 'not to be a sale',
thus, the plaintiff cannot maintain an action based on the theories
of express or implied warranties, or theories under the Alabama
Extended Manufacturer's Liability Doctrine."

     The judge also rejected the plaintiff's claim that the
products provided him were not blood derivatives, but instead
drugs, which are excluded from the application of the blood shield
law.  "The only source of Factor VIII is human blood," he wrote.
"The processing methods and the additions of additives does not
eliminate the core component of Factor VIII -- blood."

     Judge Street, however, allowed the plaintiff's accusations of
negligence against the defendants to remain "as viable claims for
the present."

     Miles is represented by Denise Dodson and James Gerwin of
Bradley, Arant, Rose & White in Birmingham, AL; Terry Tottenham and
John Beckwith of Fulbright and Jaworski in Austin, TX; and Geoffrey
R.W. Smith of McDermott, Will & Emery in Washington, DC.  John
Johnson of Lightfoot, Franklin, White & Lucas in Birmingham and
Douglas Fuson, Sara Gourley and Lory Barsdate of Sidley & Austin in
Chicago represent Armour.

     Watkins is represented by Karen Ross and Lloyd Gathings of

NY CT. SAYS PRIVACY IS NOT PROTECTED IN PUBLIC PROCEEDING

     A federal judge in Manhattan on June 14 dismissed a man's suit
which claimed his identity and HIV-positive status were revealed in
a New York City Commission on Human Rights press release that
detailed a settlement he reached in a bias suit against Delta Air
Lines (Doe v. The City of New York, the City of New York Commission
on Human Rights et al., SD NY, No. 92-CIV.-8044[TPG]).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     U.S. District Court Judge Thomas P. Griesa ruled against
plaintiff "John Doe" on the grounds that while the August 1992
conciliation agreement he reached with Delta may have barred the
disclosure of his identity, the negotiations which led to the
agreement were public record proceedings of the Commission.

     In early 1992, Doe filed a commission complaint against Delta,
claiming the company refused to hire him because of his sexual
orientation and because he was HIV-positive.  The agreement under
which he was hired by Delta with back pay was executed with the
assistance of the commission's Law Enforcement Bureau.  Although a
commission press release on the agreement did not mention Doe by
name, Doe says it included enough detail to allow his co-workers to
discover that he was the subject of the settlement.

     "Whatever right of confidentiality plaintiff had came from the
contract he entered into with Delta and the Commission, and stems
from the contract not the Constitution," wrote Judge Griesa, who
also dismissed state-based claims for lack of jurisdiction.
"Plaintiff's proceeding before the Commission and the resulting
conciliation agreement would have been a matter of public record
but for the non-disclosure provision of the agreement."

     The judge noted a "difference of view among the parties as to
the proper interpretation of the contract," and said "what needs to
be litigated here is the issue of contract interpretation."

     Doe is represented by Thomas J. Hall and Marla Hassner of
Chadbourne & Parke.  The defendant is represented by Assistant
Corporation Counsel Neil Corwin. All are located in New York City.

LA APP. CT. SAYS SUIT OVER '85 TRANSFUSION WAS FILED LATE

     The Louisiana Court of Appeals on June 16 rejected the
assertions of an HIV-positive woman who said her infection liabilty
suit against a hospital was based on strict liability, not medical
malpractice laws, and affirmed the dismissal of her suit as
untimely (In re: LeBlanc v. Meza, LA Ct. of App., 3rd Cir., No. 92-
1040).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     The panel, in a 3-2 decision, said it would not "carve an
exception" out of state law to accept Murley LeBlanc's strict
liability claim against Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center
for the "distribution of defective blood."  It also said that the
record did not support her claim that because the hospital and two
defendant physicians failed to tell her that she had received a
transfusion during a March 5, 1985, operation there, they acted to
delay her suit against them.

     The plaintiff, who was transfused 15 days before Lourdes
received a newly-released test for detecting HIV-tainted blood,
learned she was HIV-positive in August 1989.

     While the majority rejected LeBlanc's argument against the
constitutionality of the state's medical malpractice limitations
statute (La. R.S. 9 Sec. 5628), a dissenting justice said the rule
discriminates against plaintiffs unaware of an injury until after
the expiration of an applicable three year period.  "Malpractice
claims have long been recognized in this state," said the dissent.
"A cause of action for malpractice was vested and existed the
moment the first drop of tainted blood entered the plaintiff's
body.  The distinction is that it had not accrued prior to the
lapse of a three year period.  The statute does not operate as a
bar to a cause of action before it existed, but operated to limit
the cause of action.  Therefore, the LeBlancs had a cause of action
that was a vested property right."

     The majority noted that recent judicial rulings in the state
indicate that a Louisiana Supreme Court ruling on the legality of
Sec. 5628 "is imminent."   It said, however, that it would "await
a decision" and declined to declare the statute unconstitutional
"based on the statistical evidence presented by the LeBlancs."
Concluded the panel, "while it may be true that the statute
operates to discriminate against Mrs. LeBlanc and members of her
class, we cannot say that this discrimination overrides the state's
interest in limiting the time period for bringing medical
malpractice actions."

CONNECTICUT COURT DENIES DOCTOR'S MOTION FOR NONSUIT

     A Connecticut Superior Court Judge rejected on June 10 a
defendant physician's motion for nonsuit in an AIDS confidentiality
case pending an in camera review of the plaintiff's social services
files (Doe v. Marselle, CT Super. Ct., Jud. Dist. of Hartford/New
Britain, No. CV-92-0449141S).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Judge Marshall K. Berger Jr. sealed the case file after
issuing his memorandum ordering plaintiff "Jane Doe" to present
notes from her social worker's file which she says are unrelated to
her claims against defendant Dionisio Flores, M.D.  The physician
requested the information as part of the discovery process in the
suit in which Doe accuses Flores of improperly releasing
confidential information on her HIV status.

     Dr. Flores moved for nonsuit in September 1992 after receiving
redacted versions of the documents in question.  While Doe
maintains the files on her conversations with the social worker are
not related to the claims asserted in the suit, the physician
insists they are directly tied to Doe's accusations that the
disclosure of her HIV status caused damage to her reputation,
severe mental distress and physical manifestations of that
distress.

     Judge Berger ordered that the documents be presented for his
review, noting that their disclosure could be allowed under state
law in cases in which a plaintiff "introduces his mental condition
as an element of his claim or defense."  Concluded the court, "if,
as the plaintiff asserts, the redacted portions of the notes are
unrelated to the injuries in the complaint, the interests of
justice may not require disclosure."

     Dr. Flores is represented by Anna M. Carbonaro of O'Keefe,
Dunn & Jackson of Hartford, CT.  Co-defendant Doris Marselle is
counseled by Jim Hayes of Hanrahan, Grabowski & Hayes in Bristol,

SETTLEMENT ENDS HIV BIAS SUIT AGAINST CA DENTAL CHAIN

     The Los Angeles City Attorney's office and a chain of area
dental clinics on June 16 announced the settlement of a California
Superior Court suit which accused the firm of discriminatorily
denying dental treatment to persons with HIV or AIDS-related
illnesses (The People of the State of California v. Western Dental
Services, Inc. CA Super. Ct., Los Angeles Cty., No. BC050051).

     (The settlement agreement is available from Andrews Document
Access Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from
Pennsylvania.)

     Without admitting that it committed acts of discrimination,
defendant Western Dental Services, Inc., operator of several
clinics in the Los Angeles area, agreed to the dismissal of the
suit against it in return for its implementation of an ongoing
training program on AIDS-related issues for its professional and
staff employees.

               Under the agreement, Western reaffirms its written employment
policies which "reflect its commitment to provide dental care
services to HIV-positive and AIDS patients on a non-discriminatory
basis."  Western will update its patient information materials
reflecting its non-discrimination policies and make them available
to the public in both English and Spanish.

     The settlement, approved by Superior Court Judge Victor E.
Chavez, calls for the court to monitor Western's performance for
three years and contains provisions for reporting violations of its
terms and conditions.

     The suit was originally filed in March 1992 by several civil
rights organizations on behalf of four HIV-positive men who said
they were denied further treatment by Western after revealing their
medical status.  Kathleen M. Wohn, an attorney for the original
plaintiffs, says the portion of the settlement applying to them
remains confidential."

     The state is represented by Los Angeles City Attorney James

NY FUNERAL HOME TOLD TO PAY $60,000 TO SETTLE BIAS CASE

     A New York Division of Human Rights commissioner on June 9
ordered a New Windson, NY, funeral director to pay $20,000 in
compensatory damages to each of three siblings of an AIDS victim
who were convinced not to follow their brother's wish to have an
open casket service based on the funeral director's claim that the
body would pose a health threat to them and their visitors
(Agresti v. Coloni Funeral Home, Inc. et al., NY Div. of Human
Rights, Nos. 9K-P-D-89-134721, 9K-P-D-89-134723, 9K-P-D-89-134793).

     (The ruling is available from Andrews Document Access Service.
Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Commissioner Margarita Rosa found that Richard Coloni,
operator of the Coloni Funeral Home, violated New York State Human
Rights Law in April 1989 when he persuaded complainants Frank
Agresti, Greg Agresti, and Ramilda Newell not to follow decedent
Alfred Agresti's instructions that he be embalmed and viewed in an
open casket.  The record indicates that Coloni told the family that
one "could catch the AIDS virus from a deceased person much like
one could catch the common cold."

     Frank Agresti, who flew from California for his brother's
burial, was allowed to view the body only after agreeing to
Coloni's condition that he wear a mask.  Complainant Greg Agresti's
wife never viewed the body upon Coloni's insistence that such
exposure could cause her harm since she was then pregnant.

     Ruling that the funeral home violated state public
accommodation laws, Commissioner Rosa said the "complainants gave
up their desire to have an open casket as a result of respondent
Richard Coloni's underlying attitude, explanations and
misrepresentations, which exhibited prejudice towards HIV
'infected' clients."  She awarded compensatory damages based on
each sibling's mental anguish, frustration and public humiliation,
suffered, she said, as the result of Coloni's "unlawful
discrimination."

CA CT. AFFIRMS ENHANCED SENTENCE FOR HIV SEX CRIME

     A California appellate court on June 1 affirmed a trial
court's 'enhancement' of a sexual offender's 72-year prison
sentence based on aggravating circumstances, including his claim
that he knew he was HIV-positive before committing his crime
(People v. Shoemake,  CA Ct. of Apps., 5th Dist., No. F017527).

     (The opinion is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Appellant Samuel Lee Shoemake opposed the handling of his Kern
County Superior Court case on a number of issues, claiming Judge
Gerald K. Davis violated the principle of corpus delicti because
prosecutors failed to independently prove that Shoemake was HIV-
positive prior to his July 1991 rape of a woman.  He said the case
against him and later the enhancement of his sentence were
insufficiently based solely on his own statements that he was HIV-
positive.

     The appeals court ruled that the corpus delicti claim did not
apply to such charges.  It said that the "proof utilized by the
state is the words of the defendant" and that "no constitutional or
statutory principle diminishes their force as evidence of the
truth."  The appeals court also rejected Shoemake's accompanying
claim that Judge Davis erred by allowing the removal of the only
African-American juror under the prosecution's exercise of a
peremptory challenge.

     The panel said much of Shoemake's appeal was void because he
failed to exercise a multiple hearsay objection at the trial level
on his claim that the AIDS-related allegations against him lacked
proof.  "For the first time on appeal, appellant challenges the
introduction of his statements, made prior to the commission of the
present offenses, that he had AIDS or was the carrier of HIV," said
the three-member appeals court in Fresno, CA.  "While he has
phrased his arguments avoiding the issue of waiver, the fact
remains that the position he advances on appeal comes down to
whether the statements were improperly admitted into evidence.  We
need not decide this question because appellant did not preserve
the issue for appeal by a timely and specific objection in the
trial court."

     The appeals court said the evidence presented before Judge
Davis was "legally sufficient" to support the enhancement of his
sentence.  His statements to two persons acknowledging that he
either had AIDS or was HIV positive, concluded the panel, "were
admitted into evidence without objection or limitation.  No
evidence was presented in rebuttal."

     Shoemake is represented by attorney Kyle Gee, who was
appointed by the appeals court.  The state is represented by state
attorneys Robert R. Anderson, Margaret Venturi and Mary Jane
Hamilton.

CCBC'S BRIEF IN BLOOD TEST DISPUTE WAS FILED NEUTRALLY

     The Council of Community Blood Banks' (CCBC) May 19 amicus
brief opposing a preliminary injunction to delay implementation of
a contract for its receipt of blood test kits, was filed neutrally
and did not support either of the two pharmaceutical firms
disputing the control of the market for such kits (Ortho Diagnostic
Systems v. Abbott Laboratories, SD NY, No. 93 CIV.2656-LBS).

     (The petition is available from Andrews Document Access
Service.  Call 1-800-345-1101 or 215-399-6600 from Pennsylvania.)

     Although the summary of the case in the most recent AIDS LR
correctly reported that CCBC opposed the injunction, it did not
indicate that the brief was submitted without comment on the merits
of either party's position.  In the brief, CCBC told U.S. District
Court Judge Leonard B. Sand that granting Ortho Disgnostic System's
(Ortho) request to halt the agreement between CCBC and Abbott
Laboratories would impose hardships on CCBC's member blood banks
and the general public.

     CCBC said a preliminary injunction would raise "uncertainties
that may have adverse consequences to recipients of blood
transfusions," because of confusion it would cause at blood banks
which have already switched from one blood test technology to
another.  "Every time a new test -- especially one with a new or
different technology -- is introduced into a blood center, standard
operating procedures must be written, equipment and reagents must
be ordered, technicians must be trained, software must be developed
and the entire complex system must be integrated and validated.
Each of these steps takes significant time and resources to assure
an error-free transition."

     Emphasizing that the amicus brief was filed only on behalf of
"CCBC, its members and the patients they serve," CCBC Executive
Director James MacPherson says his organization remains "absolutely
neutral with respect to Ortho's claims against Abbott and Abbott's
defense against those claims."

     The case is scheduled to go to trial on November 15.

     CCBC is represented by Steven Labensky and Karen Owens of
Lewis and Roca in Phoenix.  Ortho is counseled by Robert Heller,
Harold Weinberger and Michael Oberman of Kramer, Levin, Naftalis,
Nessen, Kamin & Frankel of New York City.  Jeffrey Weinberger,
Steven Perry and Glenn Pomerantz of Munger, Tolles & Olsen in Los
Angeles represents Abbott.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
"New" ACTG Moves Forward


Can the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaur
too large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?

According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - University
of Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization has
accomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the Twentieth
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,
D.C.

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)
responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.

But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs in
adults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and for
moving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDS
therapies.

DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of the
ACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since the
changes took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms were
valid, but also stressed the group's many achievements.

"We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said.
"But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is the
preeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together a
tremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."

Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for the
treatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTG
efforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way.

"This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugs
work," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."

Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combination
therapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the new
protease inhibitor saquinavir.

He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings
"to tell us what we need to do."

The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  But
most importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by which
it generates clinical trial protocols.

"One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving like
civil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processes
that prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.

The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult section
has only three committees making research decisions.  These three Research
Agenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and the
Opportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - the
Pharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient Care
Committee - will now be established as standing resource committees within
each of the three main RACs.

There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will be
centralized control of both resources and laboratories.

Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing the
ACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised of
the various committee chairs.

Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,
receiving their funds directly from DAIDS.

"Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "I
think this will work very well."

But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue to
change.

"Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," he
said.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."

He called for the active participation of each investigator.

"Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executive
committee members," Schooley said.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
John Carey Posthumously Receives Young Investigator Award


One of the nations leading AIDS caretakers is gone.

Recognized as an outstanding physician during his life, John Carey of Case
Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, posthumously received the Young
Investigator Award of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group.

The award was made during the opening session of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.

Carey's co-worker, Case Western researcher Michael Lederman, delivered a brief
eulogy.

"John was the finest physician I have ever known," Lederman said.

Dr.  Carey, 41, not only provided primary care to some 300 people with HIV
infection but also was a major investigator in ACTG clinical trials.  He was
author or co-author of numerous publications.

The award was given to Carey's mother.

"The one thing John should be remembered for is that he urged us to treat
patients as people, to allay their fears and to give them hope," she said.

The presentation was met with a prolonged standing ovation by the assembled
researchers.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

Increased levels of soluble CD14 are present in bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.

CD14 was first identified as a marker of cells derived from the
monocyte/macrophage lineage, although it was later found on other cells like
neutrophils and B lymphocytes.  The cell surface glycoprotein serves as a
cellular receptor for complexes of lipopolysaccharide with
lipopolysaccharide-binding protein.

Soluble CD14 (sCD14) is present in normal plasma and is found increased in
serum of patients with septicemia, polytrauma, and sarcoidosis.  In pulmonary
sarcoidosis, increased levels of soluble CD14 have been detected in serum and
in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.  In this study researcher Gerhard Hoheisel
and colleagues attempted to determine whether increased levels of CD14 are
also found in pulmonary tuberculosis ("Increased Soluble CD14 Levels in
Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid in Primary TB," Chest, December
1995;108:1614-1616).

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 12 patients with active but untreated
pulmonary tuberculosis and 12 healthy persons.  Cytologic and immunologic
characteristics were determined.  sCD14 was measured by a sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

"The level of soluble CD14 in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was
increased compared with controls (mean +/- 34.4 +/- ng/mL versus 11.5 +/- 22
ng/mL)," Hoheisel et al.  wrote.

"No correlation was found between sCD14 levels and bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.  We conclude that similar to
patients with sarcoidosis, increased BAL fluid levels of sCD14 are found in
patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared with controls.  Moreover,
this finding might signal a similar immunopathogenetic process contributing to
granuloma formation in both diseases.  Further studies of respective cell
surface markers and endogenous cytokine production seem necessary to determine
the significance and clinical relevance of this finding."

Drug Development (Antiviral)
Virus-Neutralizing RNAs Offer Potential as Antiviral Therapies


An in vitro selection process of RNA analogs derived from infectious viral
particles turns up elements with antiviral activity.

Current drug development techniques are dependent on the discovery of useful
agents.  Compounds with antibacterial or antiviral activity are often found
through the empirical screening of synthetic and natural compounds or the
logical design of a drug based on structures of viral and cellular proteins.
Unfortunately, empirical screening is tedious and inefficient, and logical
drug design, although promising, has not produced an abundance of successful
compounds.

Weihua Pan et al.  extended a selection-amplification procedure, previously
used to isolate RNA and DNA molecules, to target an intact virus in hopes of
discovering RNA analogs that could be developed as antiviral drugs ("Isolation
of Virus-Neutralizing RNAs from a Large Pool of Random Sequences," Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences, December 5, 1995;92(25):11509-13).

"The isolation of RNAs and RNA analogs that are effective against diverse
viral strains will be particularly necessary for inhibiting viruses such as
HIV, which has a high mutation rate and readily develops drug-resistant
strains," stated Pan et al.  "Such selection is possible and practical because
a very large structurally diverse library is used and the selection is a rapid
process."

The authors noted that there is great potential to select for molecules that
bind defined targets with high affinity and specificity due to the structural
complexity of a combinatorial sequence library of single-stranded RNA
oligonucleotides.  Due to technological advances, selected RNA molecules can
be amplified and subjected to further selection.  Multiple cycles of selection
and amplification can lead to the isolation of the best target-binding RNA
molecules from the library.

Among the family of Retroviradae (which includes HIV), the rous sarcoma virus
(RSV) has been extensively studied.  All Retroviridae viruses are envelope
viruses which use surface glycoproteins to bind to a specific receptor on a
susceptible cell and for fusion with the cellular membrane of the host.

As a model, the authors chose to target intact RSV in order to isolate the RNA
molecules and the nuclease-resistant RNA analogs that specifically bind and
neutralize this virus.

RSV was used to demonstrate that antiviral RNA and RNA analogs could be
systematically and effectively isolated from a large pool of random sequences
without prior knowledge of the structures of the viral proteins.  First, they
used intact viral particles to select from the sequence pool the RNAs and RNA
analogs that bind specifically to the virus.  Then they screened the selected
molecules for the ability to neutralize the virus.

"We reason that by binding to virus, some of the selected RNAs and RNA analogs
may change the structures of viral surface proteins so that these proteins can
no longer function in steps critical for viral infection, such as viral
attachment and virus-cell membrane fusion," stated Pan et al.  "Alternatively,
some of the structural changes may trigger pathways to inhibit the steps which
normally occur after virus internalization, such as the uncoating and the
expression of the virus genome."

J.A.  Levy et al.  (Am.  Soc.  Microbiol., 1994;153-158) and N.J.  Dimmock et
al.  (Curr.  Top.  Microbiol.  Immunol., 1992;183:1-149) suggested the
possibilities in both of these avenues in some of their earlier work.

Using infectious viral particles, RNA and ribonuclease-resistant RAN analogs
that bound and neutralized RSV were isolated from a large pool of random
sequences by multiple cycles of in vitro selection.  Because RSV imposes
permeation problems, the selected RNAs were targeted to inhibit RSV infection
by binding to the virus surface, and not by entering the virus itself.

The sequences chosen completely neutralized the virus at concentrations of
0.16 (micro)M.  Of the 19 selected sequences isolated to be concentrated, five
of them inhibited RSV infection after cloning.  These five RNA and RNA analogs
neutralized the RSV by interacting with the virus itself.  They did not
adversely affect the host cells used in the in vitro experiments.

A potential problem with developing RNA as a therapeutic agent is the rapid
degradation of unmodified RNA by ribonucleases in vivo, noted the authors.
They suggested solving this problem by incorporating modified nucleotides into
the RNA chain.

The strain of RSV used during the experiments was the Prague A.  After testing
the selected RNAs against a different strain, the Prague C, the authors found
that the RNA analogs inhibited infection of this strain also, although at
concentrations 15-20 times higher.

Future methods of RNA selection could be performed by alternating between
several strains of virus during the different cycles of selection to
specifically isolate the RNAs and RNA analogs that could bind to several
diverse strains of the virus.  This could be particularly helpful when it
comes to treating viruses with a history of multiple mutations such as HIV,
noted the authors.

Several advantages were noted by the authors for the use of intact biological
entities (infectious virus particles) instead of viral proteins:

* Selection by intact viral particles does not require the full understanding
of all the ways that a virus can infect its host.  If selection is made by an
isolated viral protein, the selection is limited to only the cases in which
proteins responsible for viral infection have been identified and isolated.

* It avoids the problem of structural differences in purified proteins.
Proteins in their purified form may not interact with the protein complexed on
a virion.

* Selection using intact virus particles may lead to the identification of
viral components previously unknown.

"The success of isolating numerous anti-RSV RNAs and RNA analogs from a large
pool of random sequences immediately suggests the potential application of
this approach to isolate RNA and nuclease-resistant RNA analogs against other
viruses such as HIV," concluded Pan et al.

This research was supported by Pennsylvania State University Start-up funds;
National Institutes of Health grant CA47482; American Cancer Society grant
FRA427; and funds from the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.

Education and Prevention
Availability of Condoms in Quebec Secondary Schools a Priority


The health and welfare policy of the Quebec Health and Social Services
Ministry, Canada, stipulates that preventive measures must be strengthened in
order to reduce the incidence of HIV and other STDs.

According to the policy, one priority activity for the health and social
services network is to make condoms accessible to young people in schools.

In order to assess the effectiveness of measures taken to make condoms
accessible in schools, a survey was carried out in May 1994 in 164 Quebec
health centers (CLSCs).  The CLSC survey showed that of 478 Quebec secondary
schools, 192 (40.2 percent) did not make condoms available; 20 schools (4.4
percent) were in the process of doing so and 265 (55.4 percent) did provide
them.

These figures paint a rather positive picture, compared to the United States,
where in 1992 only 8 percent of schools were reported to have adopted a condom
distribution program.  However, the program's effectiveness is still somewhat
limited because of the main method used to distribute the condoms.

The results show that of the 265 schools distributing condoms, 237 (89.4
percent) did so mainly through their health services.  Automatic distributors
were used in 88 (33.2 percent) schools; 12 schools made them available through
teaching staff; and 13 (4.9 percent) used peer-group projects.

Access to health services has certain limits:  the lack of anonymity and
restricted opening hours.  In addition, some health services do distribute
condoms, but only unofficially.  Ensuring access to condoms through the health
services has the advantage of creating a link between students and healthcare
workers, and encourages educational activity.  However, health services staff
are not always present in many schools; they may only be there a few days a
week.  Moreover, some students say they are intimidated and prefer a more
impersonal approach.

Strides have been taken towards making condoms more accessible in schools than
was the case just a few years ago:  88 schools now provide condom distributors
compared to about 40 in 1992.  This method provides real accessibility, since
hours of access are unlimited and it is far more anonymous than the health
services approach.  Some data collected indicate that provision of condom
machines results from a conscious decision by the school authorities, whereas
distribution by health services may be done without official approval.

The CLSC survey shows that in 192 Quebec schools, the main sources of
reluctance to make condoms available were school principals (90 CLSCs),
followed by parents (86 CLSCs), teaching staff (75 CLSCs), school boards (67
CLSCs) and guidance counselors (62 CLSCs).  Pupils are much less frequently
mentioned as being reluctant (30 CLSCs).

As in an American study, school principals also perceive parents to be an
obstacle to introducing sex education.  However, that perception by CLSCs or
school principals is contradicted by several surveys which have shown a high
rate of acceptance for making condoms available to young people.

In April 1991 the central parents' committee of the Montreal Catholic School
Board, Quebec, Canada, carried out a survey of their school committees.  It
showed that 68.8 percent of respondents were in favor of installing condom
distribution machines in secondary schools.  The survey also revealed that
32.5 percent of parents felt that they were the ones who should decide whether
or not the condom distributors should be installed.

When one seeks to understand why there is reluctance to making condoms
available, the factor most often mentioned by CLSCs (40 percent of cases) is
the fear of encouraging young people to have sexual relations.  Next is the
failure to see any need to make condoms available (30.2 percent); then other
means of access because of proximity to a convenience store, pharmacy or CLSC
(27.6 percent) and, finally, a fear of vandalism against distribution machines
(13.6 percent).

The preliminary results of a study conducted by Joanne Otis of the Universite
du Quebec a Montreal indicate that the number of young people who have sexual
relations is no higher in schools which have distributors than in those which
do not.  These results seem to contradict the hypothesis that the presence of
condom distributors would encourage sexual activity.

A recent Swiss study shows that advertising campaigns to promote condom use
have not increased the number of young people having sexual relations nor the
number of partners they have, but rather have increased the use of condoms by
adolescent boys and girls.  These results were recently corroborated by the
World Health Organization (WHO), which analyzed 90 studies to determine the
impact of sex education on school children.

Education and Prevention
Youth Reaching Out to Youth


The following press release was received from Africans in Partnership Against
AIDS, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Africans in Partnership Against AIDS (APAA) is a community-based organization
formed by members of the African community.  APAA provides HIV/AIDS education
in a culturally appropriate manner and supportive environment for people
living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs), their partners, lovers, families and friends.

We believe in the health and dignity of people living with HIV/AIDS and
recognize the difficulties people face when they are infected with HIV.

A Youth Committee, composed entirely of youth between the ages of 14 and 24,
was set up in September 1994.  Adults are not invited to their meetings, but
can be consulted on issues which need clarification or advice.  The youths
want their own space within the agency to address their issues without
interference.

The Youth Outreach Coordinator initiates her outreach to youth with a letter
to parents, requesting the participation of their children.  The coordinator
attends activities at youth groups, cultural gatherings, churches and mosques
to promote the program.

The Youth Committee works closely with other youth agencies and AIDS service
organizations in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, drawing on a wealth of experience
and expertise on HIV/AIDS and African youth.

The youth have found that in order to address HIV/AIDS effectively, other
factors must be considered.  The most frequently discussed topics include:

* Parent/youth relationships - youth want parents to acknowledge that their
children live in Canadian society and to be open towards them;

* Health issues - including sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, safer
sex, pregnancy and drugs;

* Employment counselling - youths want skills to make wise choices for their
future employment;

* Networking - to meet youth from other communities to learn how they cope
with HIV/AIDS;

* People living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) - youth want to relate compassionately to
PHAs, families and friends.

On August 5, 1995, eight of APAA's youths participated in the Caribana Parade
to promote safer sex messages.  They designed envelopes containing condoms,
condom manuals, referral lists for youth in Toronto, and matchboxes containing
condoms and safer sex messages drawn from current rap music.  Over 10,000
condoms were distributed at that time.

These are some of the safer sex slogans used in the outreach work:

* Using a condom makes a man last longer!!

* Sex ain't nothin' to die for ...

* Enter a storm without a raincoat, you're bound to get wet!

* When a man uses a condom, it shows he respects me as a woman.

Epidemiology (HIV)
Study Reveals Alarming Prevalence of HIV in Young People


One in every 92 men in the age group of 27 through 39 may be infected with
HIV, according to the most precise estimates yet of the pandemic's toll.

Minorities are far and away the hardest hit, with one of every 33 young
African American men estimated to be infected in 1993.  The latest and most
accurate data available is from 1993 and was published in a report in the
December 8, 1995, issue of the journal Science.

Study author, Philip Rosenberg, of the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI)
forecasts a bleak future if this trend continues, suggesting that "the threat
of AIDS may become a rite of passage" for young people.  This latest report
reaffirms the government's warning that AIDS is threatening more and more
young people.

In January 1995, the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
announced that AIDS in 1993 became the number one killer for people in the age
group from 25 through 44.

Rosenberg's study counters the optimism expressed in the government's recent
announcement that AIDS appears to have leveled off, with 40,000 new infections
every year balanced by 40,000 new deaths.  This apparent plateau is really a
disguise for the increased risk facing young Americans.

It is a fact that only young Caucasian men have seen a drop in new infections
in recent years, while the risk has dramatically increased for young
minorities and women.

Cornelius Baker of the National Association of People with AIDS (NAPWA)
underscored the meaning of the most recent report on prevalence of HIV, when
he stated that, "I don't think most people really get it, that (infection) is
a potential for them.  ...  We have to be clear:  Right now ...  if you get
HIV in your twenties, you will die by around forty years old."

Epidemiology (HIV)
WHO Reports 18.5 Million Have HIV


An estimated 18.5 million people worldwide are infected with HIV - a sharply
higher number attributed to better reporting rather a surge in the epidemic,
the United Nations (U.N.)  health agency said.

About six million people are thought to have developed AIDS since the start of
the epidemic in the late 1970s, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.  Of
these, 4.5 million have died.

An estimated 6,000 people are infected each day with HIV; of the 18.5 million
already infected, 1.5 million are children, the agency said.

WHO previously estimated that 1 million children and between 13 million and 15
million adults are infected with HIV and a total of 4.5 million people had
developed the disease.

The agency said the new figures reflected an improvement in estimating
techniques, better HIV prevalence studies and other research, rather than a
sudden jump in new infections.

Two-thirds of the estimated HIV cases and three-quarters of advanced AIDS
cases, are in sub-Saharan Africa, WHO said.

India has the most HIV carriers - an estimated 1.75 million of its one billion
people.  Thailand - another country where experts fear an explosion in cases -
has 700,000 HIV carriers.

The highest proportional HIV rate was in Botswana, with about 18 percent of
sexually active adults infected.  An estimated 17 percent of adults aged 15-49
had the virus in Zambia and Zimbabwe and 15 percent in Uganda.

In the Americas, Haiti had the highest proportion of HIV carriers, at 4.4
percent.  The Bahamas followed at 3.9 percent, with Barbados at 2.8 percent.
In the United States, where an estimated 700,000 people were HIV positive at
the end of 1994, the infection rate was 0.5 percent.

In Europe, Spain had the highest rate of HIV infections, with 0.58 percent of
sexually active adults, followed by Switzerland with 0.2 percent, WHO said.
WHO is forced to rely on estimates to gauge the spread of HIV and AIDS because
actual cases reported by governments give little idea of the true picture,
especially in Africa.

North Korea reports no cases of HIV.

Although WHO estimated the true number of AIDS cases at six million, the
actual number reported by governments was 1.3 million.  The United States
accounted for 39 percent of all the reported cases but only 7 percent of the
estimated cases.

The figures for HIV infections are for the end of 1994, while the AIDS figures
include cases that developed in 1995.  A WHO official said there was a slight
overlap in the two categories.

Industry News (Blood Substitutes)
Hemolink Phase II Trials to Begin in 1996


A red blood cell substitute will go into Phase II clinical trials early in
1996 and, if all goes well, could be available on the market by 1999.

The announcement was made at the 1995 International Chemical Congress of
Pacific Basin Societies, held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 17-22, 1995.

The blood substitute, Hemolink, manufactured by Hemosol, is made of chemically
modified hemoglobin, says Dr.  Gord Adamson, a company scientist.  Hemolink is
derived from screened and tested blood that is outdated because it has been
stored for more than six weeks.

Hemosol takes the expired blood, separates out the red blood cells and
extracts the hemoglobin.  That's more complicated than it sounds.  "A red cell
is not just a package of clean hemoglobin," Adamson says.  "It contains about
90 different proteins."  The company heat-treats the hemoglobin to destroy any
contaminating viruses that may have eluded the screening process conducted by
collection agencies.  Other remaining proteins are then removed by a novel
displacement chromatographic process.

The process strips away blood-group antigens and other proteins, so Hemolink
can be used by all patients regardless of blood type.  And the purification
steps make the likelihood of transmission of diseases such as HIV and
hepatitis "virtually" nil, according to Adamson.

"The reason we say 'virtually,"' he notes, "is because scientifically it is
impossible to prove total absence of a virus," but he is very confident that
Hemolink would pose no threat to users in terms of blood-borne diseases.  In
addition, the blood from which Hemolink is derived is already approved for
use; the company does not accept contaminated units.

After purification, the free hemoglobin is cross-linked with oxidized
raffinose, a sugar molecule.  This "improves the ability of the free
hemoglobin to deliver oxygen to tissue, stabilizes each hemoglobin molecule
and links together several such molecules so that they are large enough to
circulate for extended periods," Adamson says.

Human trials with Hemolink show the blood substitute circulates for a couple
of days in the blood stream - compared with a month or more for transfused red
cells - and is then excreted, says Adamson.  But animal trials show this is
long enough to counteract oxygen shortages during acute blood loss, say, in an
accident or an operation.  In fact, these trials showed that animals treated
with Hemolink did just as well as those treated with transfusions of the
animals' own blood.

Hemosol is currently working with two versions of Hemolink, one a fluid stored
in a refrigerator and one frozen.  Either formulation would be suitable for
surgical applications.  A long-term goal is to develop a freeze-dried
formulation.  It would be light enough to ship to remote depots - for use in
disasters or military conflicts, for example - and it could be reconstituted
with sterile water on-site.

Adamson believes the cost for Hemolink would be competitive, noting that there
are significant administrative costs associated with the existing blood
collection and distribution system.  These include the storage, transport,
disposal and other labor and record-keeping activities that a successful blood
substitute would significantly reduce.  Also, since no cross-matching would be
required, these costs would be saved.

Hemolink also would avoid some of the costly problems associated with blood
transfusions - such as transmission of disease (ranging from HIV or hepatitis
to a bacterial infection), or mismatched blood (where the patient might have a
reaction to antigens in the donor's blood that could be mild, such as a fever,
or severe, resulting in death), or the delays in surgery brought about by
blood shortages.

Hemosol will not rely just on Hemolink to launch itself in this market.  The
company is collaborating with Ronald Kluger, a chemistry professor with the
University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to further extend cross-linking
technologies for second-generation products.

Adamson says the work also is aimed at chemically modifying hemoglobin so it
can serve as a carrier for drug molecules.  Tissues that can accumulate and
metabolize protein-drug conjugates are potential targets.  An example is a
solid tumor.  Adamson says this would reduce many of the side-effects of
anti-tumor agents.

A large-scale conversion from red cells to blood substitutes is unrealistic,
particularly in the short term, Adamson says.  But assuming they win approval,
blood substitutes could ultimately bring in big money.  Industry estimates of
the potential market for blood substitutes (and newer applications where red
cells can't be used) by the year 2002 are around 1.5 million units (worth
US$500 million) in North America, and over three million units worldwide,
Hemosol says.

Industry News (Clinical Trials)
Results Announced for SnET2 To Treat Cancers


PDT Inc.  (PDTI), Santa Barbara, California, announced preliminary Phase I/II
clinical results for its first drug, tin ethyl etiopurpurin (SnET2), for the
treatment of certain skin cancers and AIDS related Kaposi sarcoma (KS).

At a financial conference in New York, New York, Gary S.  Kledzik, Ph.D.,
chairman and chief executive officer, stated:  "In the Phase I/II clinical
trials, photodynamic therapy with SnET2 eliminated or reduced a substantial
number of tumors and demonstrated an excellent safety profile.

"These preliminary results indicate SnET2 is a promising drug for treating
solid tumors, although Phase III studies are needed to provide definitive
data.  Final preparations are under way with our corporate partner, Pharmacia
& Upjohn, for Phase III trials in the U.S.  and Europe."

Photodynamic therapy uses drugs which are activated by light to selectively
destroy diseased cells, such as cancer, with minimal effects on normal
tissues.  The company's first clinical studies with SnET2 involved a combined
Phase I/II study for treatment of certain skin cancers, and a second combined
study for treatment of AIDS related KS.  These studies assessed the safety of
the drug and evaluated the drug and light doses needed to achieve tumor
responses.

The Phase I/II skin cancer study included basal cell carcinomas (skin cancers
caused primarily by sun exposure), basal cell nevus syndrome (a genetic
disease which causes multiple, recurrent basal cell carcinomas), and
metastatic adenocarcinomas (cancers which originate in glands, such as breast
cancer, and in this study have metastasized or spread to the skin).

This skin-cancer study included a total of 46 patients and 418 tumors.  In
Phase I, combinations of drug and light doses were investigated.  The Phase II
portion was conducted at the anticipated optimal drug/light dose.

Evaluable tumor responses were as follows:  100 percent of the basal cell
carcinomas had complete responses (no visible or palpable evidence of tumor
remained).  In basal cell nevus syndrome patients, 95 percent of tumors
responded.  Of the responding tumors, 86 percent were complete responses and
14 percent were partial responses (reduced by 50 percent or more in size).

In metastatic adenocarcinoma patients, 100 percent of tumors responded; 96
percent were complete responses and 4 percent were partial.  This Phase I/II
KS study involved an additional 45 patients with a total of 404 tumors.

Phase I of this study investigated drug and light combinations.  Phase II
studies were conducted using the anticipated optimal drug dose and two
selected light doses.  At the higher light dose, 63 percent of the evaluable
tumors responded.  60 percent of the responding tumors were complete responses
and 40 percent were partial.

The safety of SnET2 was also investigated during these clinical trials.  Side
effects were minimal.  The most common side effect was mild, transient skin
sun sensitivity, which occurred in a small percentage of patients and did not
require treatment.  No clinically significant abnormal trends were noted in
the laboratory parameters.

The company emphasized that these data are interim and that final analyses
have not been concluded.  The primary goal of Phase I/II clinical trials is to
assess safety and dosing parameters.  Phase III studies are required to
determine efficacy.

Industry News (Joint Venture) 
Phase I/II Clinical Trials with Protease Inhibitor for HIV Begins 


Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, announced that its
partner Glaxo Wellcome has started Phase I/II clinical trials with VX-478
(141W94), a orally administered protease inhibitor designed for the treatment
of HIV and AIDS.

The multi-center study is being conducted at sites in the United States and
Europe.  This study is part of an international clinical development program
for VX-478 being undertaken by Glaxo Wellcome, Kissei Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd., Matsumoto-City, Japan, and Vertex.

The Phase I/II trial announced is a dose-ranging study designed to test the
antiviral efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VX-478 during four
weeks of drug administration in HIV positive individuals.  The trial will
initially investigate three dose levels:  300 mg twice daily; 300 mg three
times daily and 450 mg twice daily.

Higher doses may be explored based on the tolerability of VX-478 at the
initial doses.  VX-478 has been shown to be well-tolerated in Phase I clinical
studies which evaluated single doses up to 1200 mg.  To assess the anti-HIV
activity of VX-478 at each dose level, the study will monitor CD4 counts and
the viral load of the study participants.

The data from this trial will be used by Glaxo Wellcome and Kissei to design
advanced trials to assess the safety and anti-HIV efficacy of VX-478 alone and
in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

"This Phase I/II trial builds on the strong tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
bioavailability data generated for VX-478 in the Phase I trial completed
earlier [in 1995]," commented Dr.  Joshua Boger, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Vertex.  "This trial marks the beginning of an accelerated effort
to move VX-478 through clinical development."

In July 1995, Glaxo Wellcome reported data from a Phase I trial of VX-478.  In
this study, VX-478 was well-tolerated and displayed excellent pharmacokinetics
at the single doses tested, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg and 1200 mg.

The amount of VX-478 detected in the blood was directly proportional to the
doses administered.  At eight hours following administration, the level of
VX-478 detected in the bloodstream for each of the doses was well above the
IC[90], the concentration of drug that eliminates 90 percent of HIV
replication in vitro.  The half-life of the compound ranged from approximately
seven to ten hours, and oral bioavailability was calculated at greater than 70
percent.

HIV protease, a viral enzyme required by the virus for replication, is widely
recognized as a promising therapeutic target for treatment of HIV infection
and AIDS.  The HIV protease is an alternative target to reverse transcriptase,
the viral enzyme targeted by drugs such as Retrovir (AZT), Videx (ddI), Hivid
(ddC) and Epivir (3TC).

Industry News (Thalidomide)
Drug Available to AIDS Patients Under Expanded Access Provisions


Celgene Corporation, Warren, New Jersey, reports it has launched a U.S.  Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved program for expanded access to its
thalidomide drug Synovir for AIDS patients suffering from cachexia, a severe
weight loss condition.

Up to now, the drug has been available to the AIDS community only through
unregulated procurement from unknown sources.

Permission to dispense the drug legally to physicians treating AIDS patients
was granted recently by the FDA and was followed in October 1995 by FDA
approval of a request by Celgene to recover costs for supplying the drug and
related clinical expenses.  Both FDA actions are considered unusual for an
experimental compound still in clinical trials.

Celgene said it has begun sending official documents to the first of hundreds
of physicians who have expressed interest in entering patients in the open
label compassionate use protocol.

Under provisions agreed to with the FDA, interested physicians must receive
permission from their affiliated hospitals to enroll patients in the study.
Celgene will then dispense the drug to the physicians.  It is estimated that
roughly 100,000 US AIDS patients suffer from severe weight loss.

Celgene said the cost of Synovir will be about $550 for a 12-week supply.  By
comparison, recombinant human growth hormone, which is available to AIDS
patients under a treatment investigational new drug (IND), is currently priced
at approximately $11,000 for a 12-week supply, according to industry sources.
Synovir's price was established under FDA guidelines and enables Celgene to
recover costs of manufacture, R&D and handling of the expanded access program.

A portion of the Synovir distributed will be provided free of charge to
economically-disenfranchised patients.

The protocol for the expanded access trial of Synovir is complementary to
Celgene's placebo-controlled HIV wasting trial and provides patients who fail
to meet admission criteria of that study access to the drug.

The broad entry criteria, coupled with greater physician access, substantially
increases the availability of Synovir to patients who may benefit from the
therapy, Celgene said.

The expanded access program is open to patients suffering from AIDS related
weight loss including those with coincident opportunistic infections or
malignancies and also to those who have previously failed to respond to other
therapies aimed at treating HIV wasting.  More severely ill patients may
receive Synovir via a salvage arm of the trial.

Weight gain is the primary endpoint.  Patients can continue the therapy after
the initial 12-week treatment period, although informed consent will be
required every six months.

Infection Control
TB and AIDS Programs - Natural Partners or Not?


Can tuberculosis and AIDS prevention and treatment programs be successfully
combined?

The question was debated during a tuberculosis (TB) conference in Paris with
researchers expressing differing views.

D.A.  Enarson of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
(IUATLD) argued that tuberculosis and AIDS prevention services are less than
compatible, because they target different groups.

"Tuberculosis prevention is a medical services related activity whereas HIV
prevention is a general population activity," Enarson noted.

"Because of the difference in the point of implementation of the two programs,
attempts to combine them are difficult."

Enarson made the remarks at the 1995 annual meeting of the IUATLD Conference
on Global Lung Health, held in Paris, France.

Enarson noted that while the goal of TB and HIV prevention programs is the
same - to prevent infections - the focus must be different.

"In the case of tuberculosis, prevention is based on a strategy of case
management in which infectious cases are found and treated, thereby preventing
transmission from the source (the sick patient)," Enarson noted in an abstract
presented at the conference.  "This is the only means of primary prevention.
Persons with the infection who are not sick almost never transmit the
infection to others.  With HIV infection, transmission occurs from an infected
person who usually has no clinical evidence of the infection.

"Prevention of transmission of this infection is, in general, based on general
health education aimed at behavior modification, Thus, the point of
implementation of the two programs is quite different:  for HIV, the point of
implementation must be the general population of subsets of it."

R.  O'Brien of the World Health Organization's Global Tuberculosis Program
countered that collaboration between AIDS and tuberculosis programs is
essential if services for already-infected persons are to be efficiently
implement.

"Isoniazid preventive therapy for co-infected persons may be highly effective,
but little work on its programmatic application has been undertaken," O'Brien
noted.  "Testing of TB patients for HIV may provide for better patient care
and help reduce HIV transmission, but voluntary testing with counselling is
not widely available."

O'Brien noted that virtually no home-based care programs for AIDS patients
with TB exist, even though these programs may help alleviate the burden on TB
programs and prevent further TB transmission in households.

O'Brien also found efforts to control nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis
to be lacking.

"AIDS and TB programs have unique expertise and orientations which together
can address the problems," he wrote in an abstract presented to the IUATLD
meeting.

"Unfortunately, until now these factors have been used as excuses for working
separately rather than for seeking fruitful collaboration.  However, TB is now
recognized as the most important opportunistic infection and cause of death in
HIV infected persons worldwide.  TB and HIV/AIDS programs can no longer be
permitted to function in isolation and must collaborate to improve care and
preventive services for those suffering from this 'deadly duo'."

The World Health Organization's E.  van Praag agreed that home-care programs
for people with AIDS offer unique opportunities to control tuberculosis in
developing areas.

"Over the last few years initiatives to set up community-based or home care
programs for people and families living with HIV/AIDS have mushroomed
rapidly," van Praag wrote in an abstract of a presentation to the IUATLD
conference.  "In countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, between 50-100
different home care programs can be identified (Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Thailand).  These initiatives are a response to needs felt by HIV affected
families, communities and health staff in environments where hospitals can
scarcely cope and economic survival and social status of those families have
seriously deteriorated, due to AIDS.

"More than half of the people with HIV related illness will develop
tuberculosis.  Early recognition of tuberculosis and chances to complete
treatment are again hampered by limited collaboration within various health
care programs and by AIDS specific issues such as recurrent illnesses and
reduced income to afford frequent return visits.  Opportunities exist within
home care programs where peripheral health and social staff are in close
contact with patients and family care givers to early recognize TB disease
among HIV infected and affected family members.  Home care staff could provide
drugs, supervise DOT and educate families and communities about HIV and TB
prevention and care.  Projects in Ghana, Zimbabwe and South Africa have
already implemented joint TB and AIDS home care programs."

Researcher D.A.  Enarson is from the IUATLD, Paris, France.  R.  O'Brien and
E.  van Praag are from the Global Tuberculosis Program and the Global Program
on AIDS, World Health Organization, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.

Prophylaxis (TB)
Isoniazid-Based Therapy Useful Despite Hepatotoxicity


Prophylactic isoniazid therapy is beneficial to all patients with pulmonary
fibrotic lesions compatible with previous tuberculosis (TB), despite the risk
of potentially life-threatening complications such as hepatitis, according to
a report from Switzerland.

The report warns, however, that it is still unclear whether the benefits of
such therapy outweigh possible side-effects.

Tuberculosis reactivation is increased among patients with chest X-rays
showing untreated fibrotic lesions suggestive of healed, previous TB
(so-called fibrotic lesions).

"Prophylactic treatment with a six to 12-month course of isoniazid (INH) has
proven effective in these cases, giving about 70 percent protection rate
against reactivation of TB," researcher F.P.  Sarasin and colleagues wrote
("Isoniazid Preventive Therapy for Pulmonary Tuberculosis Sequelae:  Which
Patients Up to Which Age?"  Tubercle and Lung Disease, 1995;76:394-400).

"Nonetheless, whether the benefit of isoniazid outweighs it potentially
life-threatening side effects (isoniazid-induced hepatitis) in all age groups,
and in patients with coexisting diseases that limit life expectancy such as
severe chronic heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), a frequent clinical situation, remains unstudied."

Earlier studies have focused on recommendations for prophylactic isoniazid
among patients with positive tuberculin skin test reactions only.  None,
however, has specifically addressed recommendations regarding persons with
fibrotic lesions discovered on chest X-ray.

In this study Sarasin et al.  conducted a Markov-based decision analysis model
which balances the risk of recurrent TB against TB-related mortality,
incidence of isoniazid-related hepatitis, and isoniazid-related death.

They also sought to determine the optimal strategy between a six- to 12-month
course of prophylactic isoniazid and therapeutic abstention in different age
groups and in patients with severe coexisting diseases that limit life
expectancy such as CHF or COPD.

"The core of our decision tree was a model representing the natural history of
untreated patients with pulmonary tuberculosis sequelae," Sarasin et al.
wrote.  "Over time, they may die from different age- or gender-related causes,
or develop early or late TB and die from it.  Whether these patients may
benefit from prophylactic isoniazid involves weighing the trade-offs between
the short term risks of isoniazid-related complications and avoidance of TB
reactivation, a benefit that may be accrued over the short or the long term,
depending on when TB occurs."

The Markov decision analysis found that in all groups of patients,
prophylactic isoniazid clearly reduced the number of deaths from tuberculosis,
whereas very few cases died from isoniazid-related toxicity.  However, because
isoniazid-related deaths occur early, and TB-related deaths can occur early or
late, the gain in life expectancy was small.

"Particularly for patients with short survival such as those older than 80
years and those with CHF or COPD, the average gain in life expectancy provided
by prophylactic isoniazid did not exceed on week," Sarasin et al.  wrote.

"When the gains in life expectancy provided by prophylactic isoniazid are
small and may not be considered clinically relevant, the optimal therapeutic
decision becomes a toss-up.  In clinical practice, toss-ups will undoubted be
interpreted differently by the physicians, the patients, and the health care
planners.  While physicians will focus on the patient's attitude toward risk
(risk-aversion versus risk-seeking profile) and on therapeutic observance,
patients will pay much more attention to the quality of life associated with
isoniazid therapy, and specifically the inconvenience of taking medication,
office visits, and laboratory tests.  On the other hand, from the health
planners' vantage point, the potential epidemiologic benefit of preventing
several future TB cases by treating one patient preventively will be the most
important determinant of decision making."

The authors conclude that the usually recommended six- to 12-month course of
prophylactic isoniazid is beneficial to all cohort age groups.  They added,
however, that recommendations should be modulated for the very elderly and
those with severe disease that limits life expectancy.

"For this subgroup of patients, frequently encountered in daily clinical
practice, the decision whether and for how long to give prophylactic therapy
might reasonably be left to the judgement of the individual patient and the
physician," they wrote.

Therapy
Levofloxacin More Active than Ofloxacin in In Vitro Study


The experimental antituberculosis quinolone levofloxacin showed two- to
four-times more antimicrobial activity than ofloxacin in a newly reported in
vitro study from Japan.

"Levofloxacin showed greater activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv
phagocytosed in macrophages than ofloxacin," researcher H.  Saito and
colleagues wrote ("In Vitro Antimycobacterial Activity of a New Quinolone,
Levofloxacin," Tubercle and Lung Disease, 1995;76:377-380).

Levofloxacin, the optically active L-isomer of ofloxacin, exhibits significant
bactericidal activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase and has a strong antimicrobial
activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

The antimicrobial activity of levofloxacin has been found to be eight to 128
times greater than that of the corresponding D-isomer and approximately twice
as potent as that of ofloxacin.

In earlier studies Saito et al.  reported that some new quinolones including
ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin and sparfloxacin possessed appreciable in
vitro and in vivo antimycobacterial activity, especially against Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, M.  kansasii, M.  fortuitum, and M.  leprae.

In this study Saito et al.  examined in vitro antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various pathogenic mycobacteria, in particular M.
tuberculosis and M.  avium complex (MAC).

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofloxacin for various
mycobacterial species were determined by the agar dilution method using 7H11
medium and compared with those of ofloxacin.  Antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against M.  tuberculosis and M.  intracellulare phagocytosed in
murine peritoneal macrophages was measured in terms of reducing
cell-associated bacterial colony forming units (CFUs).

MICs of levofloxacin against M.  tuberculosis, M.  kansasii, M.  marinum, M.
scrofulaceum, M.  avium, M.  intracellulare, M.  fortuitum, and M.  chelonae
were two to four times lower than those of ofloxacin.  Levofloxacin exhibited
higher efficacy in reducing bacterial CFUs in macrophages than ofloxacin.

"The present results showed that in vitro antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various mycobacteria was two to four times greater than
that of ofloxacin, in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration values," Saito
et al.  wrote.

Previous investigators have reported that the antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various bacteria other than mycobacteria is generally
twice that of ofloxacin (Hayakawa et al., Antimicrob Agents and Chemother
1986;29:163-164; Imamura et al., Antimicrob Agents and Chemo 1987;31:325-327
and Tanka et al., J Antimicrob Chemother 1990;26:659-666).

"The difference in in vitro activity of levofloxacin from ofloxacin in these
reports is therefore consistent with that in the present study," Saito et al.
wrote.  "In the case of M.  intracellulare, significant delay of bacterial
growth was caused by levofloxacin added at 1 mg/L, but such efficacy was not
observed for ofloxacin at the same concentration.  Levofloxacin and ofloxacin
at doses of 10 mg/L prevented the bacterial growth during the whole incubation
period.  There were significant differences between these two quinolones in
the efficacy in reducing the intra-macrophage growth of M.  intracellulare."

Microbiology and Immunology, Shimane Medical University, Izumo 693, Japan.

Transmission
New Policy Cautions HIV Infected Women on Breastfeeding


To prevent the spread of HIV to newborns, the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP) recommends that HIV infected women shouldn't breastfeed or donate
breastmilk to milk banks.  Despite the numerous health benefits of
breastfeeding to infants, the potential for HIV infection through human milk
exists, according to a new AAP policy.

Among the recommendations, the Academy recommends all women seeking prenatal
care should be counseled about the risk of HIV transmission and should be
offered voluntary HIV testing.  The academy's recommendations are intended for
the U.S., where infectious diseases and malnutrition are not major causes of
infant death and where safe alternatives to breastfeeding are available.

In cases where HIV infection is known not to be present, the Academy continues
to strongly promote breastfeeding as the optimal form of infant nutrition.

Xenotransplantation
Baboon BMT Experiment a Reality


Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Structured
Biologicals Inc.  (SBI), Toronto, Ontario, Canada, announced that an SBI
sponsored experiment consisting of a bone-marrow transplant from a baboon to
an AIDS patient took place at a San Francisco, California, hospital.

On July 14, 1995, an advisory panel to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) unanimously recommended that one AIDS patient be allowed to receive an
experimental bone-marrow transplant from a baboon.  Collaborators on the
experiment include Dr.  Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S.  National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr.  Robert Gallo, a pioneering
AIDS researcher at the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., also a lecturer in surgery at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, took part in the procedure.

The experiment was devised by Dr.  Suzanne Ildstadt, Chief, Division of
Cellular Therapeutics, Pittsburgh University School of Medicine.  Ildstadt
discovered a novel blood cell, the "facilitating" cell, which eliminates the
risk of graft-versus-host disease, a fatal adverse reaction, and successfully
fights transplant rejection.

Baboons are naturally resistant to HIV-1.  It is therefore believed that the
uninfected baboon bone marrow cells will join the HIV infected human marrow to
restore the patient's immune function.

The applied "facilitating" cell technology may dramatically change the
practice of transplantation in that it could potentially enable permanent
acceptance of transplanted organs such as heart, kidney, lung and liver as
well as transplanted cells or tissue, all without the need for tissue matching
or prolonged administration of immunosuppressive drugs.

The technology could provide effective treatments for blood and autoimmune
diseases, such as:  Leukemia and Lymphoma, Sickle Cell Anemia, Thalassemia,
Systemic Lupus Euythematosis, Crohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes, and may
ultimately permit successful xenotransplantation (cross-species
transplantation).

Pumerantz, P.A.  Selwyn and V.P.  Neklesa, et al.  New Haven, Connecticut.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  To assess the accuracy of
chest radiographic interpretation in the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia (BP), and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in
HIV-positive patients and to identify the frequency with which these
infections mimic each other radiographically.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The
admitting chest radiographs of 153 HIV-positive patients with laboratory
proved BP (n=71), PCP (n=73) and pulmonary TB (n=9) and those of 10 HIV
positive patients with no active disease were reviewed retrospectively and
independently by 3 radiologists.  Readers were blinded to clinical
presentation, CD4 count, original radiographic interpretation, and final
diagnosis.  For each case, the radiologists listed a single diagnosis followed
by an assessment of degree of confidence.  RESULTS:  A confident diagnosis was
made in 136 of 163 cases (83.4%).  By specific diagnostic category, the median
accuracies are as follows:  pulmonary TB, 85%; PCP, 75%; BP, 64%; and no
active disease, 100%.  Correcting for random agreement, there was moderate
interobserver agreement.  Fifteen of 153 cases (9.8%) mimicked other
infections radiographically and were given the same inaccurate diagnosis by
all 3 independent observers.  CONCLUSION:  Chest radiographic interpretation
allows a confident and accurate diagnosis to be made in the majority of HIV
positive patients with PCP, BP, and TB at the time of hospitalization.  In
approximately 10% of cases, these infections may mimic each other
radiographically."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  To illustrate the
difficulty in establishing the diagnosis of esophageal lymphoma in patients
with AIDS and concomitant viral infection.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Esophageal
lymphoma or possible esophageal lymphoma was diagnosed in 8 AIDS patients over
a 4-year period.  Six patients underwent esophagography, in addition to
endoscopy and biopsy.  Four patients underwent repeated biopsies.  No patients
underwent immunologic marker studies.  RESULTS:  Only 1 patient had a polypoid
mass in the distal esophagus typical of neoplasm.  The other 7 patients had
esophageal ulcers that radiologically and at gross inspection endoscopically
were considered of viral (cytomegalovirus [CMV] or idiopathic) origin.
Pathologic examination initially suggested lymphoma in all 7 patients with
concomitant CMV in 5.  Follow-up biopsies revealed that the 'lymphomatous'
infiltrate was actually inflammatory reaction in 3.  In 1 patient, an isolated
CMV inclusion was discovered on the 2nd biopsy, and the esophageal ulcer
resolved with ganciclovir despite continued pathologic evidence of lymphoma.
CONCLUSION:  Esophageal lymphoma and viral infection coexist such that there
can be considerable diagnostic and thereby therapeutic confusion in regard to
these patients.  In patients with radiologically benign viral ulcers, repeat
biopsy or marker studies of pathologically 'lymphomatous' lesions are in
order."

spaces.  Diagnosis is made by means of lumbar puncture or biopsy.  For
intramedullary lymphoma in which biopsy is potentially dangerous, an empiric
antitoxoplasmic treatment should be undertaken if cerebrospinal fluid study
does not show lymphomatous cells.  If there is no improvement in the clinical
status and no decrease in the volume of the lesion, biopsy must be considered.
Radiation therapy can cure the lesion."

Immunology (TB)
"Regulation of the Human Cellular Immune Response in Tuberculosis."  J.J.
Ellner.  Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Pulmonary tuberculosis is characterized by activation of local and systemic
immune and inflammatory cells and mediators.  Somewhat paradoxically, delayed
type hypersensitivity responses to tuberculin purified protein derivative, and
in vitro correlates frequently are depressed in patients with tuberculosis.
Cross-modulatory cytokines, produced by mononuclear phagocytes, chiefly
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-(beta)), deactivate effector function,
depress T-cell activation and may account for depressed delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH) and increased antibody levels.  Ingestion of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis by mononuclear phagocytes stimulates expression of
cytokines.  Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-(alpha)) and TGF-(beta) function
in autocrine circuits producing activating and deactivating signals,
respectively, for macrophage effector function.  Lipoarabinomannen (LAM) from
virulent M.  tuberculosis selectively induces expression of TFG-(beta)
relative to TFG-(alpha) by monocytes.  In patients with tuberculosis,
TFG-(beta) is expressed in granulomas, and blood monocytes show increased
spontaneous and tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated
production of this cytokine.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to TFG-(beta)
reverses depressed PPD-stimulated blastogenesis and interferon-gamma
expression.  Therefore, TFG-(beta) seems a key mediator of immunosuppression
and energy.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to interleukin-10 partly restores
PPD-stimulated blastogenesis.  Parallel with depressed T-cell responses,
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis show increased levels of IgM, IgG, IgG-1,
and IgE antibodies directed against M.  tuberculosis.  This finding too may
reflect cross-regulation by TFG-(beta).  Current understanding of
immunoregulation in tuberculosis provides some clear directions for
immunotherapy.  In dually-infected persons, activation of CD4 lymphocytes and
monocytes by tuberculosis might promote replication of HIV-1.  In fact, serum
and cell-derived TNF-(alpha) are increased in HIV infected tuberculosis
patients and this cytokine is known to stimulate HIV replication.  Further,
monocytes from patients with tuberculosis show increased infectability by HIV;
and PPD and M.  tuberculosis stimulate HIV replication in latently infected
macrophages.  Therefore, M.  tuberculosis and HIV infections may be mutually
enhancing.  The human immune response can be used to identify candidates for a
subunit vaccine.  Increasing evidence supports a primary role for
extracellular products of M.  tuberculosis as a target of protective immunity.
Epitope mapping of the secreted 30 kD alpha-antigen indicates immunodominance
of certain peptides that could provide the basis for an improved vaccine or
DTH skin test."

Infection Control (TB)
"Behavioral Factors in Tuberculosis Control."  E.  Sumartojo.  Division of
Tuberculosis Elimination, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, Georgia.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Tuberculosis control is directed towards ensuring that patients complete
treatment without infecting others.  Relevant Behavioral and social factors
concern the decisions and actions of individuals who influence treatment
outcomes, including persons at risk for disease, tuberculosis patients, and
health care providers.  Relevant issues include health education for patients
and for the public, provider knowledge and practice, the unique needs of HIV
infected persons and others at high risk of tuberculosis, and the quality of
treatment and control services.  Poor medication adherence remains the core
Behavioral problem in tuberculosis control.  Supervised or directly observed
therapy (DOT) is a currently accepted solution but it is not a panacea; where
successful, it is part of an array of other services.  Continuing social and
Behavioral research describes factors associated with adherence.  Ethnographic
research has addressed the knowledge and beliefs of individuals about
tuberculosis.  Findings are that individuals from various cultures associate
tuberculosis with stigmatization and rejection, have concerns about the
appropriateness and quality of health care, and are often misinformed about
the cause and treatment of the disease.  Studies of interventions show the
effectiveness of community health workers, family and community support, and
comprehensive services that include strong case management, efficient clinic
practices, and additional social or health services for patients.  Research is
emerging on communication strategies used by providers as they talk to
patients, and the impact of poor communication on patient behavior.  Studies
of treatment practices show that some physicians use inadequate regimens, with
implications for the education and supervision of physicians who treat
tuberculosis.  In the next few years, research will emphasize development of
locally appropriate and effective treatment services.  Behavioral research
must focus in intervention studies, informed by findings from existing
descriptive research, but also incorporating social and Behavioral theory and
research methods, and epidemiological research methods.  Critical issues will
be identifying the best mix of services for specific regions and types of
patients, improving provider communication strategies and provider practices,
and ensuring that persons with high likelihood of exposure or HIV infection
seek screening and complete preventive therapy or treatment for tuberculosis."

Therapy (Kaposi Sarcoma)
"Radiation Therapy of the Oral Cavity and Oropharynx In Patients with AIDS
Related Kaposi Sarcoma."  L.Z.  Nisce, M.  Coleman and T.P.  Kaulmann.  New
York, New York.


According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  The well-documented
phenomenon of exaggerated mucosal toxicity in patients with AIDS treated with
radiation therapy has generally precluded the use of this modality in patients
with Kaposi sarcoma involving the head and neck.  A study to evaluate the
feasibility of radiation therapy with an intensive oral care and radiation
planning technique was assessed at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center from 1991 to 1995.  CONCLUSION:  Numerous reports discourage the use of
radiation therapy in this group of patients.  Our preliminary results
demonstrate that radiation therapy is feasible and can markedly improve their
quality of life."

Presentations of Lymphoma in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Disease:

Predominance of T-Cell Lineage."  Archives of Dermatology, November
1995;131(11):1281-1288.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Archives of
Dermatology, "BACKGROUND AND DESIGN:  Most non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in patients
with human immunodeficiency virus infection are of B-cell lineage.  Cutaneous
lymphoma in the human immunodeficiency virus disease has not been
systematically reviewed.  We studied 25 patients with both human
immunodeficiency virus infection and cutaneous presentations of lymphoma,
using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus.
RESULTS:  Two groups of patients were discerned:  (1) those with conditions
similar to mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome with an indolent course (n=8)
and (2) those with nodules or papules, greater immunosuppression, a rapid
clinical course, and large cell lymphoma seen on biopsy specimens (n=17).  The
epidermotropic lymphomas were of T-cell lineage and CD30(-).  Thirteen of the
large cell lymphomas were also of the T-cell type, and 71% were CD30(+).
Epstein-Barr virus was absent in the epidermotropic lymphomas, but it was
present in 73% of the nonepidermotropic cases.  CONCLUSIONS:  Two forms of
human immunodeficiency virus-associated cutaneous lymphoma were found:
indolent disease resembling mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome and large
cell lymphomas with a poor prognosis, whose cells often had a CD30(+) T-cell
phenotype and harbored the Epstein-Barr virus."  The corresponding author for

Vaccine for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 in Small Animals."
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, "A
recombinant Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vector-based
vaccine that secretes the V3 principal neutralizing epitope of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) could induce immune response to the epitope and
prevent the viral infection.  By using the Japanese consensus sequence of
HIV-1, we successfully constructed chimeric protein secretion vectors by
selecting an appropriate insertion site of a carrier protein and established
the principal neutralizing determinant (PND)-peptide secretion system in BCG.
The recombinant BCG (rBCG)-inoculated guinea pigs were initially screened by
delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reactions to the PND peptide,
followed by passive transfer of the DTH by the systemic route.  Further,
immunization of mice with the rBCG resulted in induction of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes.  The guinea pig immune antisera showed elevated titers to the PND
peptide and neutralized HIVMN, and administration of serum IgG from the
vaccinated guinea pigs was effective in completely blocking the HIV infection
in thymus/liver transplanted severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)/hu or
SCID/PBL mice.  In addition, the immune serum IgG was shown to neutralize
primary field isolates of HIV that match the neutralizing sequence motif by a
peripheral blood mononuclear fell-based virus neutralization assay.  The data
support the idea that the antigen-secreting rBCG system can be used as a tool
for development of HIV vaccines."  The corresponding author for this study is:

Hodgkin's Disease
Siebert, J.D.; Ambinder, R.F.; Napoli, V.M.; Quintanillamartinez, L.; Banks,
P.M.; Gulley, M.L.  "Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Hodgkin's Disease
Contains Latent, Not Replicative, Epstein-Barr Virus."  Human Pathology,

November 1995;26(11):1191-1195.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Human Pathology,
"Severe immunodeficiency is associated with reactivation of latent
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) that is manifested by virus replication.  It is
unknown whether EBV replication also occurs in the Hodgkin's disease (HD)
tissue of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Therefore, we studied paraffin-embedded lymph nodes from 13 cases of
HIV-associated HD to determine the latent or replicative state of EBV
infection.  All patients were seropositive HIV-infected men; additional
clinical information was available for 12 patients.  The risk factor(s) for
HIV infection were homosexuality (n=7), intravenous drug abuse (n=2),
homosexuality and intravenous drug abuse (n=1), sexual promiscuity (n=1), or
hemophilia (n=1).  Advanced clinical stage and B symptoms were common at the
time of initial diagnosis of HD.  The histological subtype of Hodgkin's
disease was universally mixed cellularity, except for a single case classified
as nodular sclerosis.  Seven cases exhibited foci of relative lymphoid
depletion.  Five cases contained foci of necrosis.  Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells
and RS cell variants were positive for CD30/BerH2 and negative for CD45/LCA
CD45RO/UCHL1, and CD20/L26 in all cases.  Tumor cells were positive for
CD15/LeuM1 in seven cases.  In all 13 cases, RS cells and RS cell variants
were infected by latent EBV as shown by in situ hybridization to EBV-encoded
ribonucleic acid (EBER1).  In 12 of 13 cases neoplastic cells coexpressed EBV
latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).  EBV replication was examined by two
different methods:  immunohistochemistry to identify EBV-encoded BZLF1 protein
and in situ hybridization to detect EBV BHLF1 transcripts.  No positivity in
RS or RS cell variants was detected with either assay of EBV replication (95%
confidence interval [CI]=0% to 23%).  The findings confirm that EBV is
detected more frequently in HIV-associated HD when compared with
immunocompetent patients with HD.  The findings also suggest that EBV is
tightly latent within RS and RS cell variants of HIV-associated HD.  It
appears that factors other than host immune status are important in
maintaining EBV latency in HIV-associated HD."  The corresponding author for

Retroviral Disease:  Influence of Major Histocompatibility Complex Type and
T-Cell Responsiveness."  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of

the United States of America, November 7, 1995;92(23):10492-10495.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,
"Administration of virus-specific antibodies is known to be an effective early
treatment for some viral infections.  Such immunotherapy probably acts by
antibody-mediated neutralization of viral infectivity and is often thought to
function independently of T-cell-mediated immune responses.  In the present
experiments, we studied passive antibody therapy using Friend murine leukemia
virus complex as a model for an immunosuppressive retroviral disease in adult
mice.  The results showed that antibody therapy could induce recovery from a
well-established retroviral infection.  However, the success of therapy was
dependent on the presence of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes.  Thus,
cell-mediated responses were required for recovery from infection even in the
presence of therapeutic levels of antibody.  The major histocompatibility type
of the mice was also an important factor determining the relative success of
antibody therapy in this system, but it was less critical for low-dose than
for high-dose infections.  Our results imply that limited T-cell
responsiveness as dictated by major histocompatibility genes and/or stage of
disease may have contributed to previous immunotherapy failures in AIDS
patients.  Possible strategies to improve the efficacy of future therapies are
discussed."  The corresponding author for this study is:  KJ Hasenkrug, Niaid,

Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavior
Steele, A.; Melby, V.  "Nurses' Knowledge and Beliefs about AIDS:  Comparing
Nurses in Hospital, Community and Hospice Settings."  Journal of Advanced
Nursing, November 1995;22(5):879-887.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Advanced Nursing, "The literature reports an ongoing debate amongst nurses
regarding the risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through
routine nursing care.  An emotionally charged dilemma appears to exist for
many nurses regarding what they perceive as conflict between professional
obligation and personal risk.  This study investigates nurses' beliefs,
knowledge and perceptions of risk of contracting HIV while implementing their
nursing care.  The study focuses on qualified nurses in the hospice, hospital
and community settings.  No other similar comparative study that also focuses
on hospice nurses has been identified.  This quantitative study was
implemented within Northern Ireland, by way of a respondent-administered
questionnaire.  The study's sample consisted of 45 qualified nurses and a
response rate of 93% (42 respondents) was achieved.  Analysis of the data
involved the use of descriptive and correlational statistics.  Overall
findings indicated that many nurses, but particularly those who work in the
hospital and community settings, hold negative and biased beliefs, and have
inadequate knowledge and misguided perceptions regarding their risk of
contracting HIV through the implementation of routine nursing care of clients.
Many of those nurses readily admit their lack of knowledge.  On the whole,
hospice nurses appear more knowledgeable and exhibit a more positive approach
to AIDS clients, and appear less fearful than do nurses in the other two
settings.  Implications for hospital management, for nurse education, for
nurses themselves and for clients are discussed.  This study should be seen as
a springboard for future research within Northern Ireland."  The corresponding

Women."  British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, November

1995;102(11):869-875.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in British Journal
of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, "OBJECTIVE:  To describe the changing clinical
and immunological characteristics and timing of diagnosis of HIV-infected
pregnant women enrolled in the European Collaborative Study.  DESIGN:  A
prospective study of the mothers of children enrolled in the European
Collaborative Study on children born to HIV-infected women.  SETTING:
Twenty-one European centres in seven countries.  SUBJECTS:  One thousand six
hundred and ninety HIV-infected women and their 1754 deliveries.  RESULTS:
The proportion of women in whom HIV infection had been diagnosed before
pregnancy increased significantly over time, from 7% in 1984-1985 to 65% in
1994 (P<0.001).  The prevalence of breastfeeding, which was related to the
timing of diagnosis, significantly declined over the study period.  The mean
CD4 count was 510 cells/mm(3), and there was a significant decline in average
CD4 count over the study period.  Black women had a significantly lower CD4
count than white women.  From survival analysis it is estimated that five
years after delivery, 14% of women will have died and 24% will have developed
CDC stage IV disease.  CONCLUSIONS:  Timing of diagnosis is of critical
importance if mother-to-child transmission is to be reduced through avoidance
of breastfeeding and zidovudine therapy and effective antenatal screening
policies have become increasingly important.  The rate of progression of
maternal disease highlights the implications of HIV infection for their

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Archives of
Ophthalmology, "OBJECTIVE:  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1000-and
5000-centistoke silicone oil as retinal tamponades for the treatment of
retinal detachments secondary to necrotizing retinitis in patients with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.  DESIGN:  A prospective observational
study.  SETTING:  Community and university-based ophthalmology clinics.
PATIENTS:  Three hundred fifty patients with HIV infection, who had 407 eyes
with retinal detachments secondary to necrotizing retinitis.  INTERVENTION:
Vitrectomy surgery for retinal detachment with 1000- or 5000-centistoke
silicone oil as the retinal tamponade.  OUTCOME MEASURES:  Efficacy was
measured both by anatomic success (defined as complete retinal attachment or
macular attachment) and by visual acuity success (defined as preservation of
visual acuity or ambulatory vision).  Safety was determined by the rate of
complications, including abnormal intraocular pressure and corneal and lens
opacification.  RESULTS:  At the last follow-up examination, the retina was
completely attached in 287 (73%) of 393 eyes, the macula was attached in 370
eyes (94%), 268 eyes (68%) had ambulatory vision, and visual acuity was
preserved in 219 (56%) of 388 eyes.  Corneal opacification, hypotony, and
silicone oil emulsification were present in 4%, 2%, and 1% of eyes,
respectively.  One eye had elevated intraocular pressure.  Of the 57 patients
who had both eyes treated, 35 died, of whom four (11%) had nonambulatory
vision in both eyes.  Of the 293 patients who had one eye treated, 122 died,
of whom 44 (36%) died with nonambulatory vision in the treated eye.  The
median time to cataract was 192 days; to nonambulatory vision, 474 days; and
to death, 204 days.  CONCLUSIONS:  Silicone oil repair of retinal detachments
in necrotizing retinitis is an efficacious and safe procedure that delays or
prevents loss of vision in advanced HIV disease."  The corresponding author

Development of Peptide Vaccine."  Biochemical and Biophysical Research

Communications, November 2, 1995;216(1):399-405.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Biochemical and
Biophysical Research Communications, "We have hijacked a process of the
receptor-mediated endocytosis to transport peptide antigens into antigen
presenting cells (APCs) for the purpose of increasing the level of antigen
presentation (named Receptor-Linked Antigen Delivery System (R-LADS)).  By
coupling an endogenous plasma proteinase inhibitor alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha
2M) to a synthetic peptide having a partial sequence of HIV-1 envelope
protein, alpha 2M was made to carry the peptide into APCs as a part of the
normal alpha 2M cycle, which resulted in an increased production of specific
antibodies against the peptide (Mitsuda, S., Nakagawa, T., Osada, T.,
Shimamoto, T., Nakazato, H.  and Ikai, A.  (1993) Biochem.  Biophys.  Res.
Commun.  194, 1155-1160).  We demonstrate here that this procedure becomes a
more efficient tool for antibody production when autologous transporter
protein was used.  By using murine alpha 2M (m alpha 2M) instead of
heterologous human alpha 2M (h alpha 2M) when mice were experimental animals,
we were able to dramatically enhance the production level of anti-HIV-1
peptide antibodies and shorten the period which is needed for antibody
production.  We aim to develop effective peptide vaccines by further improving
this system."  The corresponding author for this study is:  S Mitsuda, Tokyo

F.F.; Drummond, M.  "Cost Effectiveness of Antituberculosis Interventions."
Pharmacoeconomics, November 1995;8(5):385-399.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in
Pharmacoeconomics, "The treatment of tuberculosis (TB) is ranked as the most
cost effective of all therapeutic programmes in terms of cost per year of life
saved.  Nevertheless, TB kills or debilitates more adults aged between 15 and
59 years than any other disease in the world; furthermore, about 2 to 4% of
the burden of disease, 7% of all deaths and 26% of all preventable deaths are
directly attributable to TB.  About one-third of the world's population is
infected with the TB bacillus.  In the developing world, more women of
childbearing age die from TB than from causes directly associated with
pregnancy and childbirth.  The death of adults in their prime, who are
parents, community leaders and producers in most societies, causes a
particularly onerous burden besides being a serious public health problem.  In
the poorest countries, where the magnitude of the TB problem is greatest,
those TB control strategies that are economically feasible tend to be less
effective.  Therefore, in low and middle income countries, cost-effectiveness
considerations aimed at prioritizing resource allocation in the health sector
in general, and in TB control programmes in particular, are of paramount
importance.  Operationally, the main components of a TB control programme are:
(i) detection and treatment of TB; and (ii) prevention of TB through BCG
vaccination and chemoprophylaxis.  Priority should be given to ensuring that
TB patients complete their prescribed course of chemotherapy.  Adequate
treatment is the most effective way of preventing the spread of TB and the
emergence of drug resistance.  This article reviews evidence of the
effectiveness and cost effectiveness of different approaches to TB can,
particularly those that are applicable to low income countries, in both
HIV-infected and noninfected patients.  Financial implications and ways to
implement directly observed therapy for TB in large urban areas are discussed,
and the need to address some relevant operational issues is highlighted.  The
current role of chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination is also reviewed."  The

self-pay (n=56), Medicaid (n=254), or private insurance, including health
maintenance organizations and Medicare (n=580).  Primary outcomes were the use
and timing of bronchoscopy, the type and timing of PCP therapy, and
in-hospital mortality.  The results indicate that Medicaid patients were less
likely than privately insured patients to undergo bronchoscopy (relative odds
= 0.61; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.93; P=0.02) or to have their diagnosis of PCP
confirmed (relative odds = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.33, 0.77), after adjusting for
patient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.  Medicaid patients
were approximately three-fourths more likely than privately insured patients
(relative odds = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.96; P=0.04) to die in-hospital, after
adjusting for patient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.
However, with further adjustment for confirmation of PCP, Medicaid patients no
longer had a significantly higher likelihood of dying in-hospital.  We
conclude that Medicaid patients are less likely to receive diagnostic
bronchoscopy than privately insured or self-insured patients, more likely to
be empirically treated for PCP, and more likely to die in-hospital.  Higher
mortality among Medicaid patients may result from failure to diagnose and
treat alternative pathogens, a consequence of worse access to invasive
diagnostic tests."  The corresponding author for this study is:  CL Bennett,

Seroprevalence
Remis, R.S.; Eason, E.L.; Palmer, R.W.H.; Najjar, M.; Leclerc, P.; Lebel, F.;
Fauvel, M.  "HIV Infection among Women Undergoing Abortion in Montreal.."
Canadian Medical Association Journal, November 1, 1995;153(9):1271-1279.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Canadian Medical
Association Journal, "OBJECTIVE:  To determine the seroprevalence and
correlates of HIV infection in a subpopulation of women of childbearing age in
Montreal.  DESIGN:  Anonymous unlinked seroprevalence study.  SETTING:
Pregnancy termination unit in a teaching hospital in Montreal.  PARTICIPANTS:
Women presenting for abortion from July 1989 to June 1993 who resided in
Quebec and were not known to have HIV infection, 12017 (99.6%) of 12068
eligible women were included in the study.  INTERVENTION:  HIV antibody
testing of serum left over from samples obtained for routine Rh typing, the
same algorithm as for serodiagnostic testing, namely enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
followed by confirmatory testing of repeatedly EIA-reactive samples, was used.
OUTCOME MEASURES:  HIV serostatus by age, marital status, region of residence
(metropolitan Montreal Versus other), country of birth and number of living
children.  RESULTS:  Most (84.7%) of the subjects resided in metropolitan
Montreal.  The median age was 27.0 (range 13 to 50) years.  The serum samples
of 22 women were confirmed to be HIV positive, for an overall seroprevalence
rate of 1.8 per 1000 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8).  The seroprevalence
rate did not vary significantly by age, marital status, region of residence or
study year.  However, it was strongly correlated with country of birth:
Canada 0.16, Haiti 23.5, HIV-endemic countries other than Haiti 5.3 and
non-HIV-endemic countries other than Canada 0.0 per 1000.  The seroprevalence
rate among women born in Haiti was 147 times higher than that among women born
in Canada (P<0.0001).  Of the women born in Haiti the rate was 3.0 times
greater among those who immigrated to Canada in 1985 or later than among those
who immigrated earlier (P=0.047).  CONCLUSIONS:  The results of this study
indicate that the HIV seroprevalence rate among women in Montreal is strongly
associated with country of birth, women born in HIV-endemic countries,
especially Haiti, having the highest rate.  These results will help in the
development of policies regarding HIV antibody testing and prevention of HIV
transmission in Quebec."  The corresponding author for this study is:  RS

"Clinical and Chest Radiographic Features of Tuberculosis Associated with
Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Zimbabwe."  American Journal of Respiratory

and Critical Care Medicine, November 1995;152(5):1558-1561.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "In the developing world, the
diagnosis of tuberculosis is dependent on clinical and radiologic features as
culture facilities are not readily available.  It has been reported that
tuberculosis in HIV-positive persons can present with atypical clinical and
radiographic features.  The object of this study was to examine how often
atypical features occur in HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative persons and
how these findings correspond to sputum-smear findings.  Detailed demographic,
clinical, and chest radiographic features of tuberculosis were assessed in 202
HIV-positive adults and 220 HIV-negative patients admitted consecutively.
Using univariate analysis, several of these features were found to be
significantly associated with being HIV-positive, but after multiple
regression analysis only, age group (15 to 42 yr), a negative tuberculin
response, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, and lack of cavitation but not
sputum-smear status remained significant."  The corresponding author for this

Therapy (Hepatotoxicity)
Vandenbrande, P.; Vansteenbergen, W.; Vervoort, G.; Demedts, M.  "Aging and
Hepatotoxicity of Isoniazid and Rifampin in Pulmonary Tuberculosis."  American
Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November

1995;152(5):1705-1708.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "We evaluated whether elderly
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and without apparent preexisting liver
disease are at an increased risk to develop hepatotoxicity from an
isoniazid-rifampin regimen and require regular liver function tests in
comparison with younger patients.  We analyzed the data of 131 patients
treated in the period 1980-1985 of whom 64 (49%) were at least 60 yr of age.
Subsequent increases of transaminases (measured weekly for as long as 4 wk
after the start of treatment and later on when symptoms suggestive of
hepatotoxicity occurred) above baseline values were found more frequently in
the elderly (38 versus 18%, P<0.05) and were also more pronounced in them
(P<0.01).  The ratio of the highest transaminase value over the baseline value
was called the transaminase index (TI).  A TI of at least 5 was found in 22%
of elderly and 8% of younger patients (P=NS), but ratios as high as 10 were
mostly asymptomatic and always normalized progressively without treatment
adjustment.  Only symptomatic patients with a TI greater than or equal to 10
(five elderly and three younger) required temporary or definitive treatment
adjustment.  We conclude that repeated liver function test evaluations are
generally unnecessary, except for symptomatic elderly and younger patients
alike, in order to detect those with a TI greater than or equal to 10, thus
requiring drug adjustment."  The corresponding author for this study is:  M

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Gastroenterology, "OBJECTIVE:  To determine the incidence of hepatotoxicity
due to isoniazid and rifampin in inner-city patients with active tuberculosis.
DESIGN:  A hospital-based review of 70 consecutive in-patients in a 770-bed,
inner-city hospital.  The patient population is primarily African-American and
Hispanic.  METHODS:  Fifty-eight men and 12 women were followed from 2-12 wk
(median 4 wk).  Patients had to be treated for at least 2 wk to be eligible
for the study.  Patients were excluded if they had been on any
anti-tuberculous or any other hepatotoxic drug during the 2-month period
before their hospitalization.  Aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase,
bilirubin, and albumin were obtained at least every 2 wk.  RESULTS:
Hepatocellular toxicity, defined as AST and/or ALT greater than 200 IU/L,
occurred in eight out of 70 (11.4%) patients.  The mean age of these patients
was 38.9 yr (22-58 yr).  Patients with AIDS were significantly more likely to
develop hepatotoxicity than those with any other risk factor (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS:  Baseline aminotransferases followed by monitoring may be
necessary in AIDS patients."  The corresponding author for this study is:  LA

Toxoplasma gondii
Kasper, L.H.; Matsuura, T.; Khan, I.A.  "IL-7 Stimulates Protective Immunity
in Mice Against the Intracellular Pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii."  Journal of
Immunology, November 15, 1995;155(10):4798-4804.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Immunology, "Cytokines, in particular IFN-gamma and IL-12, are important in
host protection against infection with Toxoplasma gondii.  This parasite is a
major cause of congenital infection and morbidity in immunosuppressed persons,
especially those with AIDS.  IL-7, a monomeric protein produced by bone marrow
stromal cells and fetal thymus, is able to induce the proliferation of pro-B
cells and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and to enhance cytotoxicity of CTL and NK
cells, Inbred mice were infected with a lethal dose of T.  gondii and given
IL-7 twice daily.  Mice treated with IL-7 beginning at the time of infection
survived, whereas mice either treated after infection or not treated died.
Phenotypic analysis of splenocytes identified an expansion of NK (asialo
GM1(+)) cells and CD8(+) T-cell populations.  In vivo depletion of NK (asialo
GM1(+)) and CD8(+) T cells showed that cells expressing these phenotypes were
important for maintaining protection against the parasite.  IFN-gamma
depletion resulted in complete reversal of the protective effect of IL-7
administration.  In vivo depletion of endogenous IL-7 enhanced susceptibility
to infection.  Cytokine analysis by semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR
showed that IL-7 enhances the IFN-gamma response and furthermore reverses the
parasite-mediated down-regulatory response on IL-2.  These observations
indicate that exogenous administration of human rIL-7 is able to protect mice
against acute parasite challenge by stimulating IFN-gamma production and
augmenting the CD8(+) T cell-mediated CTL response."  The corresponding author

Virology
Huang, Y.X.; Zhang, L.Q.; Ho, D.D.  "Biological Characterization of Nef in
Long-Term Survivors of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Infection."
Journal of Virology, December 1995;69(12):8142-8146.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Virology, "We have previously shown that there were no gross deletions or
obvious sequence abnormalities within nef of human immunodeficiency virus type
1 (HIV-1) in the 10 long-term survivors studied (Y.  Huang, L.  Zhang, and
D.D, Ho, J, Virol, 69:93-100, 1995).  Here we extend our study to examine
these nef alleles in a functional context.  Using a new technique, termed
site-directed gene replacement, we have precisely replaced the nef of an
infectious molecular clone, HIV-1(HXB2), with nef alleles derived from 10
long-term survivors as well as from a patient with AIDS.  The replication
properties of these chimeric viruses demonstrated that the nef alleles derived
from long-term survivors neither significantly increased nor decreased viral
replication, compared with the nef allele of Nef(+) HIV-1(HXB2) and that
derived from a patient with AIDS.  However, Nef(+) viruses always replicated
faster than virus lacking nef.  Moreover, single-cell infection analysis by
the MAGI assay showed that these chimeric viruses, as well as Nef(+)
HIV-1(HXB2), were more infectious than Nef(-) HIV-1(HXB2) was, Therefore, we
conclude that the genotypic and phenotypic features of nef are not likely to
account for the nonprogression of HIV-1 infection in the 10 cases studied,
unless the function of the nef gene in vivo is not accurately reflected by the
in vitro assays we used."  The corresponding author for this study is:  DD Ho,

Blood Banking (Chagas Disease)
Donors with T. cruzi Pose Threat to Public Health


Trypanosoma cruzi (T.  cruzi), the cause of Chagas disease, may be a
considerable public health problem in parts of the United States.

Almost one in 5,700 blood donors in Miami, Florida and nearly one in 11,600 in
Los Angeles, California were seropositive for T.  cruzi antibodies in a
large-scale seroepidemiological study, said D.A.  Leiby, Transmissible
Diseases Department, American Red Cross, Rockville, Maryland, and colleagues
("Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma Cruzi-Antibodies in a Subpopulation of
American Red Cross Blood Donors," abstract 387, American Journal of Tropical
Medicine and Hygiene, 1995;53(2):215).

"Despite the absence of demonstrated T.  cruzi transmission by transfusion,
the finding of seroreactive donors suggests that a significant public health
problem may exist," Leiby et al.  wrote in their presentation abstract.  They
presented their findings at the 44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of
Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, San Antonio, Texas, November 17-21, 1995.

The study was performed with the Southern California and the South Florida
Regions of the American Red Cross and Abbott Laboratories.

All volunteer blood donors in the Los Angeles and Miami Red Cross blood
centers were asked a question about their place of birth or amount of time
spent in regions endemic for T.  cruzi.  Those donors who answered "yes" and a
control group were tested for the presence of T.  cruzi antibodies by EIA
(manufactured by Abbott Laboratories).

The researchers confirmed by RIPA those samples that were repeatedly reactive
by EIA.  They then entered into case-control and look-back investigations
those donors who were confirmed T.  cruzi seroreactive.

Of the donors questioned about risk, 7.4 percent (14,480/196,832) in Los
Angeles and 11 percent (1,868/17,043) in Miami responded yes.  Of these who
answered affirmatively, 20 were confirmed by RIPA (17 donors in Los Angeles;
three in Miami).  Among these 20 individuals, the risk factor they all shared
was birth in and extended residence in a country endemic for T.  cruzi.

A look-back investigation of eight patients who previously had received blood
from the infected donors showed that none of the blood recipients had
transfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi.

While none of the blood recipients in this particular study had
transfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi infection, there are documented reports of
three cases of transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease in the United States and
one case in Canada (according to a report by Ira A.  Schulman, M.D., Director
of Transfusion Medicine, LA County/USC Medical Center, delivered at the Blood
Safety & Screening Conference, October 23-25, 1995, Washington, D.C.).

Within the past 25 years, millions of immigrants have come to the United
States from countries where T.  cruzi is endemic.

Since 1991, an estimated 100,000 individuals infected with T.  cruzi reside in
North America.

Blood Banking (Donors)
January 1996 "National Volunteer Blood Donor Month"


The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), along with the American Red
Cross (ARC) and the Council of Community Blood Centers (CCBC), announced that
President Bill Clinton has proclaimed January 1996 as "National Volunteer
Blood Donor Month."

Each year, approximately eight million volunteer donors give about 14 million
units of blood to those in need.  These units are transfused to as many as
four million patients annually.

"Society depends upon healthy blood donors who choose to graciously give of
themselves each day to help others.  The AABB applauds these civic-minded men
and women as 'heroes.' What greater gift can mankind share than that of
life-saving blood," said Roger K.  Svoboda, president, AABB.

In his proclamation, President Clinton declared, "Perhaps the most noble form
of charity is the gift we give anonymously to a stranger in need.  Donating
blood offers us this opportunity.  In a fast, safe, and simple procedure, we
can literally give life to someone in our community who is suffering from
illness or injury.  During this special month, I strongly encourage all my
fellow Americans who are able to do so to take an hour from their day to
donate blood."

For 1996, the AABB has chosen "Be a Hero.  Be a Blood Donor!"  as its campaign
theme.  The association will again have celebrity spokesperson, Carol Burnett,
encourage regular blood donations from healthy first-time and repeat donors.
Insurance giant MetLife, winner of the AABB 1994 Outstanding Achievement Award
for its promotion and support of blood donation on a nationwide basis, has
joined forces with AABB to promote "National Volunteer Blood Donor Month."

During January 1996, a MetLife print campaign will appear in nationally
syndicated newspapers of the Peanuts cartoon character Snoopy hoarding cookies
with the slogan, "Give Blood.  Get Cookies."

FACTS ABOUT BLOOD AND BLOOD BANKING

HOW MUCH BLOOD IS DONATED EACH YEAR?  HOW MUCH BLOOD IS TRANSFUSED EACH YEAR?
About 14 million units (including approximately one million autologous
donations) of blood are donated each year by approximately eight million
volunteer blood donors.  These units are transfused to as many as four million
patients per year.

A unit of whole blood is roughly equivalent to a pint.  Adult males have about
12 pints of blood in their circulatory systems, and adult females have
approximately nine pints.  Each unit is usually separated into multiple
components, which may be transfused to a number of different individuals.  Up
to four components can be derived from one unit of blood.

The need for blood is great - on any given day, approximately 40,000 units of
red blood cells are needed.  Accident cases, people undergoing surgery, and
patients receiving treatment for leukemia, cancer or other diseases, such as
sickle cell disease and thalassemia, all utilize blood.  More than 23 million
units of blood components are transfused every year.

WHO DONATES BLOOD?  Less than 5 percent of healthy Americans eligible to
donate blood actually donate each year.

According to studies, the average donor is a college-educated white male,
between the ages of 30 and 50, who is married and has an above-average income.
However, these statistics are changing, and women and minority groups are
volunteering to donate in increasing numbers.

While persons 65 years and older compose 13 percent of the population, they
use 25 percent of all blood units transfused.  Using current screening and
donation procedures, a growing number of blood banks have found blood donation
by the elderly to be safe and practical.

WHERE IS BLOOD DONATED?  There are many places where blood donations can be
made.  Bloodmobiles travel to high schools, colleges, churches, and community
organizations.  People can also donate at community blood centers and
hospital-based donor centers.

Many people donate at blood drives at their place of work.  Community blood
centers collect approximately 88 percent of the nation's blood, and
hospital-based donor centers account for the other 12 percent.  Consult the
yellow pages to locate a nearby blood center or hospital to donate.

WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA FOR BLOOD DONATION?  To be eligible to donate blood, a
person must generally be at least 17 years of age (although some states permit
younger people to donate with parental consent); be in good health; and weigh
at least 110 pounds.  Most blood banks have no upper age limit.  All donors
must pass the physical and health history examinations given prior to
donation.

Nearly all blood used for transfusion in the United States is drawn from
volunteer donors.  The donor's body replenishes the fluid lost from donation
in 24 hours.  It may take up to two months to replace the lost red blood
cells.  Whole blood can be donated every eight weeks.

An increasingly common procedure is apheresis, or the process of removing a
specific component of the blood and returning the red blood cells to the
donor.  This process allows more of a particular component - platelets, for
instance - to be drawn in one sitting than could be separated from a unit of
whole blood.  Apheresis is also performed to collect plasma and granulocytes.

WHAT IS THE MOST COMMON BLOOD TYPE?  The approximate distribution of blood
types in the U.S.  population is as follows.  Distribution may be different
for specific racial and ethnic groups:

*  O    Rh-positive    38 percent
*  O    Rh-negative    7 percent
*  A    Rh-positive    34 percent
*  A    Rh-negative    6 percent
*  B    Rh-positive    9 percent
*  B    Rh-negative    2 percent
*  AB    Rh-positive    3 percent
*  AB    Rh-negative    1 percent

In an emergency, anyone can receive type O red blood cells, and type AB
individuals can receive red blood cells of any ABO group.  Therefore, people
with type O blood are known as "universal donors" and those with AB blood as
universal recipients."

WHAT TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON DONATED BLOOD?  After blood is drawn, it is tested
for ABO group and Rh type, as well as for any unexpected antibodies that may
cause problems in the recipient.  Screening tests are also performed for
hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc)
and the hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), and for antibodies to HIV (anti-HIV-1
and HIV-2), the human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and syphilis.

HOW IS BLOOD STORED AND USED?  Each unit of blood is normally separated into
several components.  Red blood cells may be stored under refrigeration for a
maximum of 42 days, or they may be frozen for up to ten years.  Red cells
carry oxygen and are commonly used to treat anemia.

Platelets are important in the control of bleeding and are used in patients
with leukemia and other forms of cancer.  Platelets may be kept for a maximum
of five days.  Granulocytes established.  They must be transfused within 24
hours of donation.  Plasma, used to control bleeding, is usually kept in the
frozen state for up to one year.  Cryoprecipitated AHF, which contains
clotting factors, is made from fresh-frozen plasma and may be stored frozen
for one year.

Other products manufactured from blood include albumin, immune globulin,
specific immune globulins and clotting factor concentrates.  These blood
products are commonly made by commercial manufacturers.

HOW MUCH DOES BLOOD COST?  While donated blood is free, and most blood
collecting organizations (blood centers as well as collecting hospitals) are
not-for-profit, there are significant costs associated with collecting,
storing, testing, and transfusing blood.  As a result, processing fees are
charged to recover costs.  Processing fees for red blood cells vary and may be
more than $100 per unit in certain parts of the country.  The national average
is between $65 and $75.  Other components may be more expensive.

Transplantation (BMT)
HLA-Matched Unrelated Donors Are Good Option for CML Patients


Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from HLA-matched volunteer unrelated donors
(VUDs) can cure a significant number of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML).

For patients with CML, allogeneic BMT is established as an effective means to
restore normal hematopoiesis.  However, the lack of a suitable HLA-identical
sibling has led to more frequent use of VUDs.  Compared with HLA-identical
sibling donor BMT, VUD BMT has been associated with greater morbidity and
mortality, especially because of greater rates of graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) and graft failure.

Andrew Spencer, Leukemia Research Fund Center for Adult Leukemia, Royal
Postgraduate Medical School, London, England, and colleagues performed an
analysis of the outcome of VUD BMT in 115 patients with CML at their
institution ("Bone Marrow Transplantation for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia with
Volunteer Unrelated Donors Using Ex Vivo or In Vivo T-Cell Depletion:  Major
Prognostic Impact of HLA Class I Identity between Donor and Recipient," Blood,
1995;86(9):3590-3597).

Their aim was to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from VUD
BMT.

"We have demonstrated that VUD BMT can cure a significant number of
appropriately selected patients with CML," wrote Spencer et al.  They added
that the availability of high-resolution tissue typing techniques enables more
accurate predictions of outcome after VUD BMT.  The use of such methods should
allow the more appropriate use of VUD BMT in managing CML.

"In young, chronic phase patients lacking an HLA-matched sibling, a search for
an unrelated donor should be commenced immediately," wrote Spencer et al.  "If
a potential donor, matched using high-resolution typing techniques, is
identified, BMT should be considered as soon as possible."

Spencer et al.  performed 115 VUD BMT for first chronic phase or advanced
phase CML between August 1985 and July 1994.  They supplemented standard
serologic HLA typing of recipients and potential donors with one-dimensional
isoelectric focusing (IEF) for class I proteins, allogenotyping for DR and DQ
alleles using DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and
the measurement of antirecipient major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor cells in the donors' blood (CTLp assay).

The overall leukemia-free survival (LFS) at three years was 37 percent.  The
probabilities of survival and LFS for patients under the age of 40 years who
were transplanted in the first chronic phase from an IEF-matched donor were 73
percent and 50 percent, respectively.

"We conclude that VUD BMT is a reasonable option for patients with CML; when
using ex vivo or in vivo T-cell depletion, optimal results are achieved in
patients transplanted in chronic phase with marrow from donors without
demonstrable class I HLA mismatch and a low CTLp frequency," wrote Spencer et
al.

The current study showed an association between graft failure and increasing
donor age that has not been recognized before.  The graft failure rate of 16
percent reported by Spender et al.  corresponds to that reported by other
researchers (McGlave et al., Blood, 1990;75:1728; McGlave et al., Blood,
1993;81:543).

Researchers have indicated that about two-thirds of patients, otherwise
eligible for BMT, lack a matched sibling donor (Beatty et al.,
Transplantation, 1988;45:714).

Transplantation (Cord Blood)
Improved Methods Address Storage and Cell Viability Challenges


Recent processing improvements should make frozen placental/umbilical cord
blood (PCB) a more useful source of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow
reconstitution.

Pablo Rubinstein and colleagues, Lindsley F.  Kimball Research Institute of
the New York Blood Center, New York, New York, addressed two key requirements
for moving unrelated-donor PCB transplantation forward as a practical
alternative for clinical use ("Processing and Cryopreservation of
Placental/Umbilical Cord Blood for Unrelated Bone Marrow Reconstitution,"
Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA, 1995;92(22):10119-10122).

First, they developed a method that maximizes freezer storage space by
concentrating the hematopoietic cells of PCB units into units of smaller
volume.  Second, they developed a method to overcome loss of viability
associated with cryopreservation and thawing.

In the unrelated donor/recipient setting, human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)-matched donors must be obtained for candidate patients.  This requires
the establishment of large panels of frozen HLA-typed PCB units, noted
Rubinstein et al.  This effort typically involves a large volume of
unprocessed PCB units consisting primarily of red blood cells, plasma and
cryopreservation medium, which take up limited, expensive frozen storage space
in liquid nitrogen.

Rubinstein et al.  designed a closed-system procedure, compatible with routine
blood bank processing, that concentrates almost all the leukocytes and
progenitor cells in PCB units.  The procedure is based on a hydroxyethyl
starch (HES)-induced rouleaux formation and mild centrifugation to separate a
leukocyte-rich supernatant from sedimented red blood cells.

"Since the probability of finding an HLA-matched unit depends on the number of
units available and since the number of units that can be stored in a given
space is determined by the average unit volume, smaller PCB units are
essential for PCB to become a practical source of tissue for unrelated
transplantation," wrote Rubinstein et al.

Decreasing the volume of PCB units by removing the bulk of red blood cells and
plasma offers practical advantages such as convenience, cost and efficiency,
compared with current options.

The second issue - reduced cell viability after the cryopreserved PCB units
are thawed - was diminished by adding one volume of isotonic diluent to the
cell suspension in 10 percent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Dilution of the freshly thawed cryopreserved unit with an equal volume of
isotonic solution allows the product to be thawed and prepared for infusion
under controlled laboratory conditions instead of at the patient's bedside,
noted the researchers.

"Removal of the cryoprotective medium can be performed there [the laboratory
setting], without harm to the units:  clonogenic activity and viability remain
essentially unchanged, even if removal of diluted DMSO is delayed for several
hours," wrote Rubinstein et al.

Removing DMSO eliminates its unfavorable side effects on the recipient
(Stroncek et al., Transfusion, 1991;31:521-526; Davis et al., Blood,
1990;75:781-786).

"These improvements make frozen PCB a more effective source of stem cells for
unrelated marrow reconstitution in the treatment of inherited disease and
hematologic malignancy and, potentially, for recombinant DNA-based gene
therapy," wrote Rubinstein et al.

The same procedure to minimize loss of viability might be used in the
cryopreservation process for bone marrow and peripheral blood stem and
progenitor cells.  It also may be possible to remove malignant cells or to
introduce chemical or genetic labels into cells before infusion.

Numerous advantages in using PCB as donor tissue for unrelated bone marrow
restoration have been reported, including timely availability of PCB to
patients and lower frequency of certain infections, as described in an earlier
published review (Rubinstein et al., Blood, 1993;7:1679-1690).

Another significant advantage of PCB grafts is their remarkably lower
incidence of associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major cause of
morbidity and mortality in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients (Sullivan,
in Bone Marrow Transplantation, eds.  Forman, Blume & Thomas, 1994, Blackwell,
Boston, pp.  339-362).

In February 1993 the New York Blood Center's Placental Blood Project started
collecting PCB units to study the clinical usefulness of this source of stem
cells (Rubinstein, Blood Cells, 1994;20:587-600).  Of the 24 patients who
received PCB grafts before February 26, 1995, 12 still were alive and doing
well as of March 30, 1995.  None of the recipients developed clinically severe
GVHD within follow-up periods of 2 to 18 months.

This work was supported in part by Grant HL 48031 from the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, and by grants
from Baxter Health Care and Citibank.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

Emerging Diseases
Could Rabies-Like Diseases Enter the U.S.?


Rabies-like diseases could cause epidemics in the U.S.  if infected animals
are imported from endemic areas, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) researchers warn.

Although each year rabies kills 40,000 to 100,000 people worldwide, only one
or two deaths occur in the U.S.  due to widespread vaccination of domestic
animals, effective (but costly) post-exposure treatment (PET), and recent
programs to vaccinate wild animals.

This reduction in mortality is expensive:  the U.S.  rabies prevention program
costs an estimated $230 million to $1 billion in public and private expenses
per year, reported Charles E.  Rupprecht and colleagues of the CDC in a recent
publication ("The Ascension of Wildlife Rabies:  A Cause for Public Health
Concern or Intervention?"  Emerging Infectious Diseases, 1995;1(4):107ff).

But little-understood cousins of the rabies virus that exist outside the U.S.
are at best only marginally susceptible to rabies vaccine.  Either accidental
or intentional importation of infected animals to non-endemic areas raise the
animal reservoir - for most if not all of these viruses are from various
species of bats.

"Infections with non-rabies lyssaviruses have resulted in rabies vaccine
failures," Rupprecht et al.  noted.  "Such infections raise the specter of
potentially serious public health consequences if introduced and subsequently
established in susceptible bat populations."

Members of the Lyssavirus genus are a group of genetically related
negative-stranded RNA viruses.  The viruses that cause rabies are the
rhabdoviridae, found everywhere except for Australia, Antarctica, and some
isolated islands.  Other Lyssaviruses include:

* Mokola virus.  The reservoir for this virus is unknown, but Rupprecht et al.
suggest that it may be some type of insectivore or rodent as it was first
isolated in a species of shrew trapped in 1968 in the Mokola Forest outside
Ibadan, Nigeria; bushveld gerbils in Zimbabwe were found to be seropositive.
Cases have occurred in Nigeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Central
African Republic, and Ethiopia.  There have been two documented human
infections.  Rabies vaccine does not protect against this virus.

* Lagosbat virus.  The reservoir for this virus is thought to be fruit bats.
Only 10 cases have been identified thus far, three in domestic animals, in
Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the Central African Republic, Senegal, and
Ethiopia.  No human deaths are documented.  Rabies virus offers only marginal
protection.

* Duvenhage virus.  The reservoir for this virus is not known, but is
suspected to be insect-eating bats.  Cases have occurred in South Africa,
Zimbabwe, and Senegal.  The virus is named after a man from Pretoria, South
Africa who in 1970 developed rabies-like encephalitis after being bitten by a
bat.  The patient died.  No cases in domestic animals have been identified.
Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 1 (EBLV1).  The reservoir for this virus is a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Eptesicus serotinus.  One human case
was documented in 1985, another was suspected in 1977.  Although the virus has
been found in more than 400 bats, no cases in domestic animals have been
identified.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBLV2).  The reservoirs for this virus is again a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Mytotis dasycneme.  The virus was
first identified in a Swiss bat biologist working in Finland who died of a
rabies-like illness.  Of the five known cases, none have occurred in domestic
animals.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

"The distances between Africa, Eurasia, Pacific Oceania, and the New World
mitigate against the dispersal, migration, and introduction of healthy bats
without human intervention," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "However, several
recent events illustrate the opportunity for the transoceanic transfer of
rabies-infected bats."

These events include:

* Research institutions.  There have been two close calls in research
facilities.  Canadian researchers in 1986 shipped a live big brown bat
(Eptesicus fuscus) to German associates.  The bat became ill was diagnosed
with rabies.  In 1994, a Massachusetts research team collected 12 wild big
brown bats and sent them to Danish researchers.  Six of the bats died of
rabies.

* Commercial enterprises.  A big brown bat was captured in Hawaii on a
container ship carrying automobiles from Michigan.  The bat was rabid.

* Legal or illegal importation of animals.  Improperly issued federal permits
in 1994 permitted import to the U.S.  of thousands of bats, mostly Egyptian
tomb bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus).  Normally, sales of imported bats or their
offspring are prohibited by federal law except by research institutions or
zoos where contact with the public is limited.  Such bats are normally
subjected to extended quarantine.  The CDC warns people who own imported bats
to prevent contact with humans.

"Although no reports of lyssaviruses isolated from Egyptian fruit bats exist,
active surveillance for such viruses has not been conducted," Rupprecht et al.
warned.  "These bats are relatively common and widespread throughout the area
that extends from Turkey and Cyprus to Pakistan, the Arabian peninsula, Egypt,
and most of sub-Saharan Africa.  Because they may roost by the thousands in a
wide variety of habitats, there is ample opportunity for interaction with
other Chiroptera, such as the widely distributed straw-colored (Eidolon
helvum) or epauletted (Epomophorus wahlbergi) fruit bats; both of these
species have been implicated in Lyssavirus epizootiology in Africa.

"The adaptability of Egyptian fruit bats should be a cause for concern because
of the potential for survival and interaction among indigenous bat fauna,
particularly in the southern United States."

Such a disaster would not be the first importation of a lyssavirus to the
United States.  While folklore recounts tales of bat-spread disease prior to
European colonization of the New World, the importation of dogs and red foxes
for the sport of fox hunting led to widespread epizootics.

When rabies became a nationally reported disease in 1938, limited surveillance
revealed 9,412 cases per year - mostly in domestic animals - with 47 human
deaths.  Rabies control efforts for pet dogs began in the 1920s and by 1960
rabies occurred more often in wild than in domestic animals.

From 1961 to 1989, skunks were the primary U.S.  reservoir for rabies but they
were then supplanted by raccoons, probably boosted by transport of infected
animals from southern states.

Along with this change in animal vectors, the human epidemiology of rabies has
changed.  Until 1965, most up to 80 percent of human cases occurred after a
known exposure, usually a dog bite.  But in the last 10 years - with the 1975
advent of a more effective canine vaccine - rabies deaths occurred in people
who had no history of an animal bite.

"Almost all the recent human cases occurred after an animal exposure that was
unrecognized by the patient as carrying a risk for rabies infection,"
Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "The apparent source of human rabies has also
changed:  14 of the 18 cases acquired in the United States since 1980 involved
rabies variants associated with insectivorous bats."

As noted above, the cost of rabies protection is high.  Rupprecht et al.
noted that the New York State rabies diagnostic laboratory received 3,000
submissions in 1989, but received 12,000 submissions in 1993 after the
epizootic of raccoon rabies reached the state.

"The cost per human life saved from rabies ranges from approximately $10,000
to $100 million, depending on the nature of the exposure and the probability
of rabies in a region," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.

"What's more, most economic analyses do not take into account the
psychological trauma caused by human exposure to rabies, the subsequent
euthanasia of pets, or the loss of wildlife resources during rabies outbreaks.
Rabies in wildlife has now reached historically high levels in the United
States, and the costs of preventing human rabies are mounting."

Rupprecht, chief of the CDC Rabies Section, and colleagues argue strongly
against population reduction of animal vectors for rabies on ecological,
economic, and ethical grounds.  They instead promote oral vaccination programs
for wildlife, a concept first proposed in the 1960s by the CDC.

"Oral rabies vaccination of the red fox with vaccine-laden baits is an
integral aspect of rabies control throughout southeastern Canada and Europe,
where more than 75 million doses of vaccine have been distributed over 5
million km(2) during the past two decades," they wrote.  "Consequently, rabies
incidence among wild and domestic animals has fallen, as have PETS for human
rabies."

However, the shift of the epizootic from foxes to raccoons required an
extensive laboratory and field research effort, as the vaccines effective for
foxes were ineffective for raccoons and coyotes.

"In 1983, a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant virus vaccine was
developed that has proven to be an effective oral immunogen in raccoons and
various other important reservoir species; vaccine advantages include improved
thermostability and an inability to cause rabies," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.
"When vaccine-laden baits are offered under natural conditions, contact with
them by nontarget wildlife species cannot be totally excluded.  However,
studies of V-RG virus have shown no vaccine-associated morbidity, mortality,
or gross pathologic lesions in more than 40 warm-blooded vertebrate species
examined."

An efficacy field trial of the V-RG vaccine took place in Cape May, New
Jersey, between spring 1992 and autumn 1994.  Nearly 100,000 fishmeal baits
laced with vaccine were distributed over 56,000 hectares both by hand and by
helicopter.  Overall rabies incidence and rate of spread was significantly
reduced.

Although oral wildlife vaccination programs are currently in Massachusetts,
New York, Florida, and southern Texas, Rupprecht et al.  noted that there are
many questions yet to be answered:

* What is the optimal ratio of animal population density to bait density?

* What level of herd immunity will be required to eliminate rabies?

* What is the best way to distribute the vaccine bait?

* How can the methods successful for foxes and raccoons be adapted to rabies
control in species such as skunks, mongooses, and dogs?

* Who will fund these programs over time?

* What do rabies control and prevention efforts really cost?

"Given the problems inherent in wildlife control, the greater issue of
extending these methods to the control of dog rabies in the developing world
will be a challenge well into the next century," Rupprecht et al.  concluded.

Encephalitis
Microsphere Formulation Improves Encephalitis Vaccine


Mouse studies show that it may be possible to make a safe vaccine against a
deadly form of viral encephalitis.

Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus - an alphavirus of the family
Togaviridae - is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fatal human infections
during epizootics among horses.

The most effective vaccine against VEE virus is the live attenuated Trinidad
donkey strain TC-83.  But not only do 20 percent of vaccinated humans and
animals fail to develop neutralizing antibody titers to TC-83, evidence
suggests that the vaccine may cause birth defects and diabetes.  Moreover,
there is concern that the vaccine strain could revert to its virulent form.

The alternative to TC-83 is the formalin-killed whole virus vaccine C-84.
While this vaccine is safe, it is far less effective than the live attenuated
vaccine and requires multiple injections for induction of immunity.

Now researcher Terrence E.  Greenway of the University of Alabama, Birmingham,
and colleagues have developed a microsphere delivery system for killed VEE
virus that is apparently both safe and immunogenic.  They reported their
results in the journal Vaccine ("Enhancement of Protective Immune Responses to
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) Virus with Microencapsulated Vaccine,"
Vaccine, 1995;13(15):1411-20).

"The microencapsulated VEE virus vaccine induced systemic immune responses
which were higher and persisted longer than those induced with the free virus
vaccine," Greenway et al.  wrote.  "The microencapsulated virus was more
effective than the free virus in inducing immune responses protective against
systemic challenge with virulent VEE virus."

Biodegradable polymer microspheres were developed over the last decade as a
means of releasing contraceptive steroids.  Vaccinologists were quick to see
the potential benefits of this technology.

"Microsphere technology has the potential benefits of reducing the number of
inoculations, enhancing the immune response via both parenteral and oral
vaccination routes, and in reducing the total antigen dose required to achieve
immune protection," wrote researcher M.C.  Steinhoff of the Center for
Immunization Research, Baltimore, Maryland, in a recent review (Vaccine,
January 1994;12(1):5-11).

Greenway and colleagues noted that a number of different research teams have
shown poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) or DL-PLG microspheres to be effective
vehicles for augmenting immune responses to antigen administered either
mucosally or systemically.

Various types of DL-PLG-based vaccines have already been proven safe in
humans.

Greenway et al.  created several versions of DL-PLG microencapsulated VEE
virus and compared their immunogenicity and protective efficacy to that of
free virus vaccine in BALB/c mice.

Subcutaneous immunization with 50 (micro)g microencapsulated VEE virus yielded
anti-VEE antibody titers up to 32 times higher than that seen with free virus.

When the mice that had received the microencapsulated vaccine received a
second booster immunization, their antibody responses remained stable
throughout the 100-day observation period.  Antibody levels began to wane only
in mice boosted with free virus.

"At high vaccine doses (i.e.  25 or 50 (micro)g), microspheres prepared with
either methylene chloride or ethyl acetate were equally effective in inducing
specific anti-VEE virus antibody response after both the primary and secondary
immunization," Greenway et al.  observed.  "However, when a lower dose (12.5
(micro)g) of the vaccines was tested, methylene chloride processed
microspheres induced higher antibody responses after both the primary and
secondary immunization.  ...  The solvent ethyl acetate reduced the
immunogenicity of formalin-fixed, inactivated VEE virus during the
microencapsulation procedure."

In addition, the researchers found that formalin-fixed VEE was far better than
non-formalin-fixed VEE for use in the microspheres.

"Formalin fixation of the whole inactivated VEE virus vaccine prior to
microencapsulation with the solvent methylene chloride dramatically enhanced
the immunogenicity of the final product, presumably through enhanced
conformational stability," they wrote.

In the mouse experiments, 80 percent of mice immunized with a single dose of 5
(micro)g VEE virus in microspheres prepared with methylene chloride survived
challenge with virulent VEE virus.  Only 20 percent of mice that received the
free virus vaccine survived challenge.

"At a high vaccine dose (i.e., 50 (micro)g), the microencapsulated vaccines
afforded 100 percent protection, whereas a similar dose of free antigen
resulted in 40 percent survival in one experiment and 100 percent survival in
a second experiment," Greenway et al.  wrote.

"These results, taken together with the protection results after secondary
immunization with either free or microencapsulated virus vaccine, indicate
that a single immunization with the microsphere vaccine could afford
protection similar to that attained with multiple immunizations with the free
virus vaccine."

The researchers are currently exploring the effectiveness of microencapsulated
VEE virus administered by various routes in protecting against aerosol
challenge with virulent VEE virus.

Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama 35294.

Human Papillomavirus (Diagnostics)
Serum Antibody to HPV-16 VLPs Indicates Cervical HPV-16 Infection


Serum antibody to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) virus-like particles
(VLPs) could be useful in epidemiology studies and for surveillance.

Louise Wideroff, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, and colleagues
evaluated an ELISA to detect serum IgG antibody response to HPV-16 VLPs
("Evaluation of Seroreactivity to Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Virus-like
Particles in an Incident Case-Control Study of Cervical Neoplasia," Journal of
Infectious Diseases, December 1995;172:1425-1430).  They used sera collected
from an incident case-control study of cervical neoplasia and compared
serologic results with established DNA markers of cervical HPV-16 infection.

Serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs is a relatively sensitive indicator of
persisting cervical HPV-16 infection, based on data from the study.

The study included 688 individuals with continued normal cytology (control
group) and 152 patients with confirmed incident squamous intraepithelial
lesions.  The patients were tested for DNA of a broad spectrum of HPV types at
the beginning of the study and at follow-up.

"Of controls, 16.6 percent were seropositive compared with 30.8 percent and
52.4 percent of cases with low- and high-grade lesions, respectively," wrote
Wideroff et al.  "Seropositivity increased from 22.2 percent in subjects who
were HPV-16 DNA positive by polymerase chain reaction once only (enrollment or
follow-up) to 83.3 percent in those who were HPV-16 DNA positive at both time
points."

Because the potential validity of any HPV serologic marker depends on how
valid an indicator it is of exposure to viral antigens, it is essential to pay
close attention to establishing the marker's validity before it is used as a
clinical or research tool, the authors noted.

HPV of differing genotypes encode a range of capsid and nonstructural proteins
that are immunogenic in the infected individual, and efforts to characterize
the host immune response to the antigens have targeted, in part, on
establishing in human sera the prevalence of anti-HPV antibodies.

Challenges associated with culturing HPV to obtain viral antigens by
traditional methods have lead to the development of alternative antigen
sources in order to perform host immune response studies.  Wideroff et al.
noted that such sources include recombinant bacterial fusion proteins,
synthetic peptides and virions produced in xenograft and raft systems.  Empty
capsids, referred to as VLPs, serve as another source of antigen.  VLPs
self-assemble in eukaryotic cells that are infected with HPV expression
vectors, such as baculovirus (Kirnbauer et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA,
1992;89:12180-12184; Rose et al., J Virol, 1993;67:1936-1944; Hagensee et al.,
J Virol, 1993;67:315-322; Kirnbauer et al., J Virol, 1993;67:6929-6936).

Previously reported research studies have demonstrated that self-assembled
HPV-16 L1 plus L2 VLPs, expressed in insect cells via baculovirus vectors, are
capable of detecting anti-HPV-16 IgG antibody in serum by ELISA (Kirnbauer et
al., J Natl Cancer Inst, 1994;86:494-499; Galloway, J Natl Cancer Inst,
1994;86:474-475).

"In epidemiologic applications, serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs could be a
useful end point biomarker in studies to determine risk factors for HPV
transmission," wrote Wideroff et al.  "It could also be considered an exposure
biomarker to assess immunologic risk factors for HPV-associated disease or as
a surrogate for viral infection itself when biologic samples are unavailable
for DNA testing."

The HPV serologic marker also could be beneficial as a surveillance tool for
estimating the population prevalence of HPV-16 exposure and to inspect
geographic variation and time trends in HPV associated infection, they added.

The HPV-16 serologic assay has been patented by contributing authors J.
Schiller, R.  Kirnbauer and D.  Lowy.  Contributing authors A.  Lorincz and
M.M.  Manos serve as scientific director and consultant, respectively, for
Digene Diagnostics and Information Management Services, Silver Spring,
Maryland.

Industry News (Blood Substitutes)
Hemolink Phase II Trials to Begin in 1996


A red blood cell substitute will go into Phase II clinical trials early in
1996 and, if all goes well, could be available on the market by 1999.

The announcement was made at the 1995 International Chemical Congress of
Pacific Basin Societies, held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 17-22, 1995.

The blood substitute, Hemolink, manufactured by Hemosol, is made of chemically
modified hemoglobin, says Dr.  Gord Adamson, a company scientist.  Hemolink is
derived from screened and tested blood that is outdated because it has been
stored for more than six weeks.

Hemosol takes the expired blood, separates out the red blood cells and
extracts the hemoglobin.  That's more complicated than it sounds.  "A red cell
is not just a package of clean hemoglobin," Adamson says.  "It contains about
90 different proteins."  The company heat-treats the hemoglobin to destroy any
contaminating viruses that may have eluded the screening process conducted by
collection agencies.  Other remaining proteins are then removed by a novel
displacement chromatographic process.

The process strips away blood-group antigens and other proteins, so Hemolink
can be used by all patients regardless of blood type.  And the purification
steps make the likelihood of transmission of diseases such as HIV and
hepatitis "virtually" nil, according to Adamson.

"The reason we say 'virtually,"' he notes, "is because scientifically it is
impossible to prove total absence of a virus," but he is very confident that
Hemolink would pose no threat to users in terms of blood-borne diseases.  In
addition, the blood from which Hemolink is derived is already approved for
use; the company does not accept contaminated units.

After purification, the free hemoglobin is cross-linked with oxidized
raffinose, a sugar molecule.  This "improves the ability of the free
hemoglobin to deliver oxygen to tissue, stabilizes each hemoglobin molecule
and links together several such molecules so that they are large enough to
circulate for extended periods," Adamson says.

Human trials with Hemolink show the blood substitute circulates for a couple
of days in the blood stream - compared with a month or more for transfused red
cells - and is then excreted, says Adamson.  But animal trials show this is
long enough to counteract oxygen shortages during acute blood loss, say, in an
accident or an operation.  In fact, these trials showed that animals treated
with Hemolink did just as well as those treated with transfusions of the
animals' own blood.

Hemosol is currently working with two versions of Hemolink, one a fluid stored
in a refrigerator and one frozen.  Either formulation would be suitable for
surgical applications.  A long-term goal is to develop a freeze-dried
formulation.  It would be light enough to ship to remote depots - for use in
disasters or military conflicts, for example - and it could be reconstituted
with sterile water on-site.

Adamson believes the cost for Hemolink would be competitive, noting that there
are significant administrative costs associated with the existing blood
collection and distribution system.  These include the storage, transport,
disposal and other labor and record-keeping activities that a successful blood
substitute would significantly reduce.  Also, since no cross-matching would be
required, these costs would be saved.

Hemolink also would avoid some of the costly problems associated with blood
transfusions - such as transmission of disease (ranging from HIV or hepatitis
to a bacterial infection), or mismatched blood (where the patient might have a
reaction to antigens in the donor's blood that could be mild, such as a fever,
or severe, resulting in death), or the delays in surgery brought about by
blood shortages.

Hemosol will not rely just on Hemolink to launch itself in this market.  The
company is collaborating with Ronald Kluger, a chemistry professor with the
University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to further extend cross-linking
technologies for second-generation products.

Adamson says the work also is aimed at chemically modifying hemoglobin so it
can serve as a carrier for drug molecules.  Tissues that can accumulate and
metabolize protein-drug conjugates are potential targets.  An example is a
solid tumor.  Adamson says this would reduce many of the side-effects of
anti-tumor agents.

A large-scale conversion from red cells to blood substitutes is unrealistic,
particularly in the short term, Adamson says.  But assuming they win approval,
blood substitutes could ultimately bring in big money.  Industry estimates of
the potential market for blood substitutes (and newer applications where red
cells can't be used) by the year 2002 are around 1.5 million units (worth
US$500 million) in North America, and over three million units worldwide,
Hemosol says.

PEG-Hemoglobin Cleared for Multi-Dose/Multi-Center Trial in Cancer Patients 


Enzon, Inc., Piscataway, New Jersey, announced that it has received clearance
from the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin a multi-dose,
multi-center clinical trial of its hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier,
PEG-hemoglobin, in cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.

The study, in patients with various advanced solid tumors, will primarily
evaluate safety related to multiple doses of PEG-hemoglobin and, secondarily,
tumor response to the combination therapy of radiation and PEG-hemoglobin.

There are two million cases of cancer diagnosed annually, according to the
American Cancer Society.  Approximately 800,000 of these cases involve solid
tumors which are now treated with radiation.  By delivering oxygen,
PEG-hemoglobin should sensitize solid tumors which may enhance response to
radiation therapy.  This process, termed "radiosensitization", may provide a
combination treatment of solid tumors, which is more effective than radiation
therapy alone.

The FDA, in a "Points to Consider" bulletin, suggested that the oxygenation of
solid tumors would be important supportive evidence for clinical efficacy of
hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers.  In response to that bulletin, Enzon
scientists have developed a clinical program focused on radiosensitization.
The company believes that PEG-hemoglobin is the only hemoglobin-based oxygen
carrier in clinical development for this indication.

Pre-clinical studies conducted at Enzon, Harvard University's Dana Farber
Cancer Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the University of Wisconsin,
Veterinary School of Medicine, demonstrated that PEG-hemoglobin enhanced the
effectiveness of radiation therapy and significantly reduced tumors in both
implanted animal models, as well as animal patients exhibiting spontaneous
tumors.

In February 1995, Enzon initiated a safety study with PEG-hemoglobin in 28
healthy volunteers.  The maximum dose administered was equivalent to 1.5 units
of whole blood.  The study, which was completed in September 1995,
demonstrated that PEG-hemoglobin in its active form, circulates in the blood
for approximately eleven days.

Patients will receive a once-a-week dose of PEG-hemoglobin for each five days
of radiation treatment during a three-week therapy program.  The dose level
will be dependent on body weight, but will be significantly less than the
highest dose used in the previous safety study.  The company also believes
that a sufficient amount of PEG-hemoglobin remains in the blood to properly
oxygenate tumors and optimize radiation therapy during the five day course of
treatment.

"This approval represents a significant advancement in our PEG-hemoglobin
program," stated Peter G.  Tombros, Enzon's president and chief executive
officer.  "We have worked closely with the FDA to develop this protocol."

At this time, Enzon will dedicate its manufacturing capability exclusively to
the production of PEG-hemoglobin to produce additional clinical materials and
complete commercial process development.  The existing facility at the present
scale is adequate to supply all PEG-hemoglobin needed for clinical trials up
to FDA approval.

Industry News (Joint Venture)
Anticancer Drug Licensing/Research Agreement Signed


Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, New Jersey, and EntreMed, Inc.,
Rockville, Maryland, announced an agreement in which Bristol-Myers Squibb will
obtain exclusive worldwide licensing rights to antiangiogenic compounds now in
development by EntreMed, Inc.

Antiangiogenic therapies, which have been shown in preclinical studies to
prevent the abnormal formation of blood vessels, have the potential to block
the growth of primary and metastatic cancers by eliminating a tumor's blood
supply.

Under the terms of the agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb has made an equity
investment in EntreMed and will fund a five-year research collaboration in the
area of angiogenesis and its application in the treatment of cancer.  In
return, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain worldwide licensing rights to the
recently discovered antiangiogenic applications of the drugs thalidomide,
thalidomide analogs and Angiostatin protein, which have generated considerable
interest in the medical community.

Angiostatin is a novel protein which may suppress malignant tumor formation by
inhibiting the growth of blood vessels.  In preclinical trials, it has
successfully caused the regression of primary human breast, prostate, and
colon tumors in animal models.

Thalidomide, developed as a sedative, has not been approved in the U.S., and
it was originally associated with birth defects.  However, if it is shown to
be an effective antiangiogenic therapy in humans, it has the potential to
become a significant anticancer agent.  There are currently no antiangiogenic
products approved for the treatment of cancer.

Angiogenesis research was pioneered by Judah Folkman, M.D., director of the
Surgical Research Laboratory at Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts,
and professor of pediatric surgery at Harvard Medical School.  Folkman was the
first to observe that cancerous tissues are fed by newly-grown blood vessels
sprouting from existing arteries.

He theorized that if doctors could prevent these blood vessels from growing,
then the tumor would starve.  Since Children's Hospital has a sponsored
research agreement with EntreMed, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain first
refusal rights on any antiangiogenic technologies developed in Folkman's
laboratory and licensed by EntreMed.

It is expected that the first clinical trials to test the antiangiogenic
properties of these compounds in cancer will begin in 1996.  EntreMed has
already initiated clinical trials with thalidomide in the treatment of
blindness due to age-related macular degeneration, another angiogenic
disorder.

Marketing Agreement Announced for Cancer Test


Biomira Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and Immunex Corporation, Seattle,
Washington, announced a co-promotion agreement for Truquant BR RIA, Biomira's
blood test for the detection of recurrent breast cancer.

As part of this co-promotion plan, Polymedco Inc., Cortlandt Manor, New York,
will continue as Biomira's exclusive distributor for this product in the U.S.
Biomira's Truquant BR in vitro test kit has recently received an approvable
letter and is awaiting marketing clearance from the U.S.  Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), which is expected during the first quarter of 1996.

The Truquant BR kit is the first and only blood test clinically proven to be a
significant and independent predictor of recurrence of breast cancer in women
with Stage II and Stage III disease.  There are more than one million women in
the United States who have been diagnosed with Stage II and Stage III breast
cancer.

Truquant BR test detects the presence in the blood of the CA27.29 antigen, a
breast cancer tumour marker.  The Truquant BR kit is under expedited FDA
review.  On September 21, 1995, the FDA received a unanimous recommendation
for approval from its Immunology Devices Advisory Panel for Biomira's Truquant
BR test.  The company has completed all conditions in the approvable letter
from the FDA, other than a site inspection which is anticipated in the first
quarter of 1996.

Preventive Medicine
Experts Call for More Counseling/Better Screening


A task force of prominent preventive health specialists recommended that
doctors and nurses offer more frequent patient counseling on personal health
and safety habits, significantly change the use of some screening tests, and
ensure that several newer immunizations are routinely provided.

The U.S.  Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel first convened
in 1984 as an initiative of the U.S.  Public Health Service, issued the first
revision of its widely used 1989 guide to effective disease prevention and
health promotion, based on a careful review of scientific evidence.

Many of the recommended changes in the 1995 "Guide to Clinical Preventive
Services, 2nd Edition" reflect new evidence about important health benefits of
selected preventive services.  Other changes reflect a more critical look at
the balance of harms and benefits of screening tests now in wide use.  The
report also reaffirms many of the disease and injury prevention practices
recommended in 1989.

In accepting the report from the Task Force, Philip R.  Lee, M.D., Assistant
Secretary for Health, noted that "Effective disease and injury prevention is
our most efficient tool for improving our health status as individuals and as
a nation.  This report, like its predecessor, moves us further toward
prevention that works."

The ten-member Task Force rejected the traditional emphasis on a standardized
annual physical examination as an effective tool for improving the health of
patients.  Instead, they emphasized that the content and the frequency of the
periodic health exam need to be tailored to the age, health risks and
preferences of each patient.

The panel recognized the proven benefits of specific measures such as periodic
screening for high blood pressure and cervical cancer, scheduled vaccinations,
and counseling about tobacco, alcohol and other lifestyle issues.  In
contrast, the Task Force found little evidence of important benefits from
other tests often included in routine check-ups, such as blood tests for
diabetes, thyroid diseases or anemia, chest X- rays, electrocardiograms and
urine tests.

According to Task Force Chair, Dr.  Harold C.  Sox, Jr., Chair of Medicine at
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, "Our review affirms the effectiveness of a
variety of preventive interventions, many of which are underutilized in
routine practice.  At the same time, other widely used preventive practices,
many of which are costly and some of which are even dangerous, show little or
no evidence that they improve health.  We based our recommendations on the
scientific evidence.  All too often, the evidence was too weak for us to make
a strong recommendation.  We need to strengthen the evidence on which our
prevention practices rest."

Although none of the recommendations depended on cost, the Task Force noted
the considerable cost of the widespread use of many unproven tests and
procedures, such as routine electrocardiograms in healthy adults and
ultrasound scans in low-risk pregnancies.

The Task Force included specialists in family medicine, internal medicine,
obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics and preventive medicine.  Over 30
outside experts in medicine, nursing, public health, epidemiology, and health
promotion and education also contributed to the project.

The Task Force assessed more than 6,000 studies of over 200 different
interventions for more than 70 diseases and conditions.  These included 53
screening tests (for cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic and nutritional
diseases, infectious diseases, vision and hearing disorders, prenatal
disorders, congenital disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, mental disorders
and substance abuse); 11 counseling topics ranging from promoting seat belt
use to preventing tobacco use; immunization against 12 common childhood and
adult diseases; and the use of aspirin and postmenopausal hormones to prevent
disease.

The report draws several broad conclusions about effective preventive care:

* Counseling patients about personal health practices (smoking, diet, physical
activity, drinking, and injury prevention and sexual practices) remains one of
the most underused, but important, parts of the health visit.

* Preventive services offered by the clinician should be tailored to the
specific behaviors and risk factors of individual patients, not offered as a
standard "routine checkup" given to all patients.

* Patients should share in decisions about preventive services.  Their
personal preferences are important in determining an approach to prevention
that is optimal for them as individuals.  This is especially true when the
evidence of benefit is weak.

* Doctors and nurses should try to deliver prevention messages and services
during every encounter with their patients, especially for high- risk patients
who are often the least likely to see clinicians for routine checkups.

The following are examples of new or revised recommendations:

* In favor of flexible sigmoidoscopy and/or annual fecal occult blood testing
to screen for colorectal cancer.

* In favor of targeting routine screening for high cholesterol and other lipid
disorders to men aged 35 to 65 and women 45 to 65, and others at increased
risk for heart disease.

* Against routine screening for prostate cancer with prostate specific antigen
(PSA) or digital rectal examination.

* Against routine urine tests for early detection of bladder cancer or
asymptomatic urinary tract infection.

* In favor of daily multivitamins with folic acid for all women who can become
pregnant (to prevent neural tube defects).

* In favor of routinely vaccinating all newborns, children, adolescents and
young adults against hepatitis B.

* In favor of routine vaccination of children against chickenpox.

* In favor of counseling parents of young children on measures to reduce the
risk of household and recreational injuries.

* In favor of discussing the use of estrogen therapy with all postmenopausal
women.

Tissue Banking
Storage of Tissues Leads to Ethical Dilemmas


If you've ever had a biopsy, do you know what happened to that sample of your
own tissue after the tests were completed?  There is a possibility that, even
without your knowledge, it ended up in a "bank" where human tissue and fluids
are collected for future use.

As Dr.  Eike-Henner Kluge of the University of Victoria in British Columbia,
Canada, told the 1995 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin
Societies, held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 17-22, 1995, "If I get hold of
your DNA, I know a lot about you, and in fact, I can identify you.  Is it an
invasion of privacy?  Kluge answers that laws regarding the protection of
privacy never looked at this area, because it didn't exist at the time the
laws were enacted."

Yet from a healthcare perspective, the establishment of a human tissue bank
can be very beneficial.  Kluge asserts that with a proper collection policy
for a tissue bank, "observations at the cellular level over a period of time,
starting with base-line studies, will allow you to identify health issues
before they reach an acute stage of toxicity.  We're beginning to see
ecological changes that reflect themselves in the tissue changes in human
beings."

Although tissue banks have existed in several countries for several decades,
the collection policy is quite haphazard.  "There is no organized way of
getting this data," Kluge contends, "or integrating the data and then doing
something with it.  We really don't have a handle on it at the human level at
all."

Getting a handle on the commercial impact may be even more difficult.  Kluge
points to one case where "cancerous liver cells were used to develop a strain
of biological products where the profit after expenses runs into the billions
of dollars."  When a state court was asked to settle the cell ownership
question, it ruled in favor of the physicians who had developed the commercial
venture rather than the individual who had been the source of the cells.

To Kluge, the problem "is very simple.  We have no international law dealing
with the collection, disposition, and use of human tissue and fluids in these
banks.  And no country has any law that really nails down who may have access
to it, who may use it for what uses, who has ownership and who has right of
disposition."

As a medical ethicist and former Director of Ethics and Legal Affairs of the
Canadian Medical Association, Kluge contends that "one has to look at the
ethics to try and develop some guidelines which are not only national, but
also international, because once the banks are established, the transfer of
tissue and fluids is international.  One then has to deal with different
cultures, different legal systems, and different kinds of perspectives of what
is appropriate and what is not appropriate."

According to Kluge, there are two possible approaches.  One of them is at the
United Nations level, "which gives rise to international conventions where
subscribers are bound by the regulations of the convention."  Another is a
"professional code of ethics, where violators would be subject to professional
sanctions."

Kluge's approach is not to look at existing law, but to look at the ethics of
the situation, especially in terms of who owns the tissue.  In a sense it is a
foundational approach which might be used as a model independent of the legal
tradition."  One option that Kluge intends to explore is to "work the relevant
ethical considerations into trade agreements, as was done with medical
informatics requirements in the European Economic Community.  That would be
particularly relevant in light of the new Pacific - Asian Rim Free Trade
initiative."

"Otherwise," Kluge warns, "if you don't do this right, you're going to have a
mess for the next fifty years."

Xenotransplantation
Baboon BMT Experiment a Reality


Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Structured
Biologicals Inc.  (SBI), Toronto, Ontario, Canada, announced that an SBI
sponsored experiment consisting of a bone-marrow transplant from a baboon to
an AIDS patient took place at a San Francisco, California, hospital.

On July 14, 1995, an advisory panel to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) unanimously recommended that one AIDS patient be allowed to receive an
experimental bone-marrow transplant from a baboon.  Collaborators on the
experiment include Dr.  Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S.  National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr.  Robert Gallo, a pioneering
AIDS researcher at the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., also a lecturer in surgery at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, took part in the procedure.

The experiment was devised by Dr.  Suzanne Ildstadt, Chief, Division of
Cellular Therapeutics, Pittsburgh University School of Medicine.  Ildstadt
discovered a novel blood cell, the "facilitating" cell, which eliminates the
risk of graft-versus-host disease, a fatal adverse reaction, and successfully
fights transplant rejection.

Baboons are naturally resistant to HIV-1.  It is therefore believed that the
uninfected baboon bone marrow cells will join the HIV infected human marrow to
restore the patient's immune function.

The applied "facilitating" cell technology may dramatically change the
practice of transplantation in that it could potentially enable permanent
acceptance of transplanted organs such as heart, kidney, lung and liver as
well as transplanted cells or tissue, all without the need for tissue matching
or prolonged administration of immunosuppressive drugs.

The technology could provide effective treatments for blood and autoimmune
diseases, such as:  Leukemia and Lymphoma, Sickle Cell Anemia, Thalassemia,
Systemic Lupus Euythematosis, Crohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes, and may
ultimately permit successful xenotransplantation (cross-species
transplantation).

December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "Anticoagulant therapy in patients
with pulmonary embolism or venous thrombosis (or patients at risk for

recurrence.  Anticoagulant levels must be carefully monitored to maintain
therapeutic dosages.  High drug levels can result in a variety of
complications that increase patient morbidity and mortality.  The clinical and
radiographic appearances of these complications may be overlooked or confused
with other pathologic processes, and this may result in unnecessary work-up
and delay proper therapy.  This exhibit presents the spectrum of complications
of anticoagulant-related bleeding as documented with CT.  Potential pitfalls
in diagnosis as well as the role of CT in management are discussed."

"Serum Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) Values as a Useful Predictor for the
Histologic Features of Chronic Hepatitis C Infection in Adults."  N.  Assy and
G.Y.  Minuk.  Liver Diseases Unit and Liver Diseases Research Laboratory,

Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg,
Manitoba.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "We assessed the predictive value of age,
gender, route of transmission, extent of steatosis, alcohol consumption and
aminotransferase values (ALT, AST) on the histologic findings of 79 adult
patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infections.  The mean (+/-SD) age of
the patient population was 43.5 +/- 10.8 years of which 60% were male.  The
route of transmission was considered to be parenteral drugs in 56%, previous
blood transfusions in 32% and various non-parenteral routes in 13%.  RESULTS:
The mean histologic activity score of the group as described by Desmet et al.
was 3.5 +/- 0.8 and fibrosis score 1.5 +/- 0.4.  The extent of inflammation
correlated with fibrosis (r=0.72).  By multivariate stepwise regression
analyses, the AST emerged as the most important predictor variable of
histologic activity (P<0.00001).  When overall histologic activity was
separated into-portal inflammation, piecemeal necrosis and lobular activity,
significant correlations existed between AST values and portal inflammation
(P<0.0001) and piecemeal necrosis (P<0.005) but not lobular activity (P=0.9).
A strong correlation was also observed between AST values and the extent of
hepatic fibrosis (P<0.0001).  On the other hand, ALT values did not correlate
with histologic activity but did correlate with the extent of hepatic fibrosis
(P<0.01).  There were no significant correlations between age, gender, route
of transmission, steatosis or alcohol consumption with the extent of
histologic activity or fibrosis.  In conclusion, AST values correlate
well-with two of three features of hepatic inflammation and with the extent of
hepatic fibrosis.  These findings suggest that AST values should be considered

"What Serologic Tests are Necessary Before a Liver Biopsy in Patients with
Hepatitis C (HCV)?."  P.G.  Quinn, D.E.  Wheeler, M.M.  Jamal and A.
Sonnenberg.  Departments of Medicine and Pathology, University of New Mexico

(UNM), Albuquerque, New Mexico.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "Before undergoing interferon therapy for
infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), patients usually undergo a liver
biopsy and multiple serologic tests to rule out other liver diseases.  In 93
HCV patients, the clinical and economic implications of omitting the serologic
tests in HCV were examined.  METHODS:  Over a period of two years, 93
consecutive patients entered the study.  Entry criteria were elevated serum
transaminases (ALT and AST), positive serum test for HCV by ELISA or RIBA, and
a liver biopsy.  Special stains assessed iron overload and alpha-1 antitrypsin
(AI AT) deficiency.  All patients had serum tests for ferritin, iron (Fe),
iron binding capacity (TIBC), A1AT, ceruloplasmin, and/or anti-nuclear
antibodies.  The costs of each test were based on the current UNM fee
schedule.  RESULTS:  None of the patients showed an abnormal test for
ceruloplasmin or A1AT.  Five patients had a ferritin value >800 ng/ml, but
only two patients also had elevated iron saturation (Fe/TIBC >65%).  The two
biopsies, however, did not contain increased iron and so were not consistent
with hemochromatosis (HC).  None of the other liver biopsies showed
histopathologic changes consistent with HC, Wilson's disease, or
MAT-deficiency.  Testing costs were:  Fe/TIBC $39.25, ferritin $61.50,
ceruloplasmin $33.50, and A1AT $30.50.  The expense for these tests totalled
$164.75 per person.  Therefore, $15,321.75 represents the potential savings in
this population of 93 patients.  CONCLUSION:  If a pre-treatment liver biopsy
is deemed necessary to assess liver pathology in an HCV patient, serologic
testing for HC, Wilson's disease and A1AT deficiency seems redundant and not
indicated, since the presence of any of these diagnoses is readily assessed by
liver biopsy with special stains.  The minor downside to this suggested
strategy is the need send fixed tissue for iron quantitation if the iron stain
is suggestive of hemochromatosis."

Correlation with ALT and Liver Histology."  M.  Persico, V.  Nigro, E.
Persico, L.  Gesue, S.  Conte, I.  de Sio, S.  Gentile and R.  Torella.

Italy.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "We studied 30 HCV-RNA positive subjects, 15
with high ALT levels and 15 with normal ALT who underwent ultrasound guided
liver biopsy.  All the subjects were comparable for age (47 yrs, range 32-63)
and sex (F/M:  6/9 and 7/8).  HCV-viremia was assessed on serum and liver
tissue according to the following method.  The most conserved region (5') of
HCV-RNA retrotranscribed and amplified with outer primers and cloned.  To this
product the middle 70 bp of exogenous DNA were added and different dilutions
of this longer product were used for competitive PCR.  Liver tissue HCV-RNA
was significantly correlated to serum HCV-RNA in 'symptomatic' patients
(M:10(6) copies of genome/ml, range 10(3)-10(9) vs.  M:10(5) copies of
genome/ml,range 10(2)-10(8); r=0.627 P<0.01).  No significantly correlation
was rather found in 'Asymptomatic' subjects.  No difference in HCV-RNA tissue
levels was detected between the two groups whereas serum HCV-RNA levels were
significantly different (M:10(2), range 750-10(7) copies of genome/ml vs.
M:10(5), range 10(2)-10(8) copies of genome/ml P<0.01).  Liver histology was
comparable in the two groups and ALT serum levels significantly related to
HCV-Viremia.  CONCLUSIONS:  HCV-viremia does not parallel tissue levels of
HCV-RNA indicating that virus C replication might also be identified in areas
other than liver.  Serum HCV-viremia seems to be the only discriminating value
among different phases of HCV related-CH."

Donors with Different Alanine Aminotransferase Profile."  F.E.  Radagli and E.
Carigni.  Hospital of Brescia, Italy; Blood Transfusion Service, Hospital of

Chiari, Italy.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "BACKGROUND:  Little is known about the viral
genotypes, the levels of viremia and the severity of liver lesions in blood
donors with HCV infection and persistently normal alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) levels.  STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:  We analyzed HCV genotype and RNA
titer in 33 volunteer blood donors, 19 with persistently normal and 14 with
raised ALT levels.  Seventeen donors with normal ALT and all donors with
raised ALT underwent liver biopsy and evaluation of the histological activity
index (HAI).  RESULTS:  Genotype 2 was detected in most donors with normal
ALT, whereas genotype 1 was more frequent among donors with raised ALT
(P<0.01).  HCV RNA titer, determined by competitive PCR, was higher in donors
with raised ALT than in those with normal ALT (median 8.2 log copies/ml, range
6.1-8.85, vs median 7.4, range 4.95-8.6, P=0.01).  The scores for portal
inflammation and for fibrosis in the HAI were higher in donors with increased
ALT (P<0.05 and P<0.01).  HCV genotype had no statistical relationship with
RNA titer; or with liver histology.  The score for periportal necrosis was
correlated with the viral titer (P<0.01).  CONCLUSION:  Both the infecting
genotype and the levels of hepatitis C virus replication were independently
associated with the ALT profile.  The severity of portal inflammation and
fibrosis was higher in donors with raised ALT, and the rate of viral
replication was correlated with the degree of periportal necrosis."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "OBJECTIVES:  To evaluate histopathological
alterations in young asymptomatic blood donors positive for hepatitis C virus
(anti-HCV-ELISA II) and the identification of known risk factors.  MATERIAL
AND METHODS:  Asymptomatic blood donors anti-HCV positive (ELISA
II/double-checked), HBsAg and HIV negatives were referred for evaluation.
Thirty-four patients who had any two alterations in the following liver
function tests (LFT):  AST, ALT, total bilirubin, serum proteinogram, GGT,
alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time were selected for percutaneous liver
biopsy and reverse trancriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for
hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV-RNA) in serum after ultrasound, platelet count and
KTTP.  RESULTS:  The mean age was 35.7 years, 82.4% were male.  LFT were
minimally abnormal and did not point to chronicity.  The histologic findings
were:  I) HCV Chronic Active Hepatitis - 29.4%; II) HCV-Chronic Persistent
Hepatitis 20.6%; III) Reactional Hepatitis - 17.6%; IV) Alcoholic Residual
Lesion - 5.9%; V) Steatosis - 8.8% and VI) Normal in 17.6%.  HCV-RNA was
detected in 26 patients (76.5%).  In these cases, liver histology and
aminotransferases were abnormal in 13 patients and remained normal in the
other 13.  HCV-RNA was not detected in 8 patients (23.5%).  Among these, 5 had
abnormal liver histology and aminotransferases; two had normal liver histology
with elevated aminotransferases and one case had abnormal liver histology with
normal aminotransferases.  History disclosed the following risk factors:  a)
Percutaneous Exposure (tattoos, non-disposable syringes use) - 65.5%; b) IV
Drug Addiction 58.8%; c) Previous Blood Transfusion - 26.5%; d) Sexual
Promiscuity - 18.5%; e) Homosexual Behavior - 15.2%.  Alcohol abusers or
dependents were 43.3%.  CONCLUSIONS:  1) Liver biopsy disclosed frequent,
occult, HCV chronic hepatitis in this population, regardless of HCV-RNA
positive or negative status; 2) Risk factors were detected in the majority of
these patients."

Gene Targeting (Stem Cells)

Enrichment for Homologous Recombination by Destabilizing Selection Marker
Transcripts from Random Integration Sites."  B.V.  Skryabin and C.  Schmauss.

Department Psychiatry and Brookdale Center for Molecular Biology, Mt.  Sinai
School of Medicine, New York, New York.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "Successful gene targeting by homologous recombination is largely
determined by the relative frequency of homologous vs.  nonhomologous
recombination events.  A widely used selection method for homologously
recombinant ES cells is a positive-negative selection (PNS) which typically
involves the placement of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene outside of the
targeted homology and the addition of antiviral drugs to the ES cell-selection
media.  However, the toxicity of such drugs (ganciclovir or FIAU) is thought
to impair the ability of ES cells to colonize the germ line.  An alternative
to the use of antiviral agents in conjunction with G-418 for PNS is to
destabilize only that portion of the neomycin phosphotransferase II mRNA that
derives from random integration sites (positive selection).  We have targeted
the dopamine D3-receptor gene locus in mouse ES cells with 5 different
replacement targeting vectors.  Four vectors contained one of the following
sequence elements that are thought to destabilize the neomycin-resitance-gene
(neor) transcript:  1) a poly (A(+)) less neorcassette; 2) a neor ribozyme
with proven catalytic activity; 3) a mutant ribozyme placed outside of the
targeted homology (control); and 4) an antisense neor sequence.  A control
vector contained the TK gene placed outside of the targeted homology.  Our
initial results indicate that these strategies are effective alternatives to
the selection with antiviral agents.  (Supported by NSF IBN-9409772)."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "The natural history of chronic HCV is poorly
understood.  We prospectively monitored the histological progression of
chronic HCV infection in untreated asymptomatic patients using serial two
yearly liver biopsies.  PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Sixty five asymptomatic HCV
RIBA positive blood donors (48 male, 17 female, median age 37 years) referred
from the Blood Transfusion Service were investigated.  Forty had an overt
parenteral risk factor for HCV exposure - 36 IVDU, 4 prior transfusion.  All
were HCV RNA+ve.  Seventeen patients (26%) had normal initial transaminases.
Median ALT was 48iu (range 9-440, normal <30), AST 48iu (range 14-200, normal
30iu).  Liver biopsy was recommended for all patients, and histology was
scored (without reference to clinical details) according to a modified Knodell
histological activity index (HAI, maximum possible score 13).  63 patients had
an initial biopsy:  median HAI=2, mean HAI=2.8, range 08, none cirrhotic.
When HAI>=6 (9 patients), treatment with alpha interferon was recommended.
When HAI<6 (54 patients), interferon was not used but 2 yearly follow-up
biopsies were recommended.  To date, 29 biopsies have been repeated in
untreated patients - 16 deteriorated, 4 improved, 9 unchanged.  In re-biopsied
patients median HAI increased from 2 to 3.  Serum HCV RNA titre was not
related to progression.  The median ALT at 2 years was unchanged in untreated
patients.  CONCLUSIONS:  In asymptomatic RIBA+ve patients initial histological
changes are mild.  In many patients there is a slow histological progression
over 2 years."

Blood Banking (Storage)
Murphy, S.; Shimizu, T.; Miripol, J.  "Platelet Storage for Transfusion in
Synthetic Media:  Further Optimization of Ingredients and Definition of Their
Roles."  Blood, November 15, 1995;86(10):3951-3960.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Blood,
"Currently, most platelet concentrates (PC) are stored for transfusion at 20
degrees C to 24 degrees C in autologous plasma.  There are potential
advantages in replacing some of this plasma with a synthetic medium.  In this
study, our major goals were to define the optimal ingredients and their
concentrations in such a medium and to gain insight into the mechanism by
which each ingredient confers benefit.  In addition, we wished to validate a
new polyvinyl chloride container plasticized with di-n-decyl phthalate (DnDP)
for PC storage.  PC derived from donations of whole blood were stored for 7
days in autologous plasma or a basic synthetic medium (BSM) containing 15
mmol/L glucose, 21 mmol/L citrate, and physiologic concentrations of salts
other than bicarbonate within either the DnDP container or a licensed
polyolefin container, PL-732.  Metabolic events were characterized and a panel
of in vitro tests were used to monitor platelet quality as systematic changes
in the BSM were made.  Platelet quality was at least as good, if not better,
after storage in DnDP in comparison to PL-732.  pH consistently decreased to
less than 6.0 because of inadequate buffering of lactic acid in BSM alone.
However, pH and the in vitro tests were well maintained by either the serial
addition of bicarbonate (BSM + B) or the addition of at least 15 mmol/L
acetate and 10 mmol/L phosphate (BSM + AP).  The benefits of BSM + AP were
traced to a decrease in lactic acid production by 33% and 19% relative to
plasma and BSM + B, respectively, and the vigorous oxidation of acetate (0.66
+/- 0.09 mmol/d/10(12) platelets).  The rates of lactate production and
acetate consumption were similar and the pH during storage correlated with the
difference between the two rates, suggesting that acetate oxidation has an
alkalinizing effect equivalent on a molar basis to the acidifying effect of
production of lactate and a hydrogen ion.  When pyruvate replaced acetate, it
was also metabolized vigorously (0.52 +/- 0.06 mmol/d/10(12) platelets), Its
presence suppressed lactic acid production by 44% relative to BSM + B and
allowed maintenance of pH and platelet quality similar to what is achieved
with acetate.  The results strongly suggest that the benefit from acetate (or
pyruvate) is derived from its oxidation and the use of a hydrogen ion during
that oxidation.  For reasons that are not yet clear, the omission of phosphate
resulted in pH decrease to less than 6.0 in 3 of 9 PC even with acetate
present.  The results allow for a more complete definition of the minimal
essential ingredients of an optimal medium relative to the amount of plasma
carried over into the PC.  With less than 20% plasma carry-over, 15 mmol/L
acetate, 14 mmol/L glucose, 10 mmol/L phosphate, and 5 mmol/L citrate produce
excellent results.  After 7 days of storage in such a medium, the results of
in vitro tests reflecting platelet quality were at least as good as, if not
better than, results after storage in plasma."  The corresponding author for

Hemophilia (HCV)

Alberti, A.  "Hepatitis C Virus Genotypes and Severity of Chronic Liver
Disease in Haemophiliacs."  British Journal of Haematology, November

1995;91(3):708-713.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in British Journal
of Haematology, "We studied the activity and stage of chronic liver disease in
45 HCV-seropositive/HIV-seronegative patients with severe haemophilia followed
for at least 10 years, HCV-RNA was detected in serum in 36 patients (80%)
Viraemic cases were further analyzed for HCV genotypes:  10 (28%) were
infected by type 1a, 10 (28%) by type 1b, seven (19%) by type 2, four (11%) by
type 3, four (11%) had mixed infections (one by 1a + 1b, one by 1a + 2, one by
type 2 + 3, and one by 1a + 2 + 3).  ALT levels were within the normal range
in 55% of the HCV-RNA negative patients but in only 11% of the viraemic cases.
Results show a trend for higher levels of ALT in HCV-RNA-positive patients
compared with those without viraemia (98 +/- 56 v 60 +/- 61), and particularly
with patients with type 3 HCV infection (148 +/- 44).  We suggest:  that a
slow progression of chronic liver disease occurs in haemophilic
HCV-positive/HIV-negative patients and conclude that presence of HCV-RNA in
serum correlates well with cytolytic damage but, in the time-scale of our
follow-up period, commonly used clinical-laboratory parameters cannot predict
the chronic evolution of liver infection or identify differences in disease
progression in relation to specific HCV subtypes."  The corresponding author

Replication in Haemophiliacs:  Role of Co-Infection with Human

Immunodeficiency Virus."  British Journal of Haematology, November
1995;91(3):703-707.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in British Journal
of Haematology, "In order to evaluate the evolution of transfusional hepatitis
C in haemophiliacs, we performed a retrospective study of ALT levels and HCV
viraemia with a RNA PCR assay in 57 patients.  We found that the vast majority
of HCV-infected patients remained viraemic (43/57= 75%) and higher ALT levels
correlated with HCV viraemia.  Although indicators of the transfusional viral
load (age, severity of haemophilia) and HBV co-infection did not correlate
with HCV RNA replication, HIV seropositivity was strongly associated with
persistence of HCV viraemia (23/25 = 92% in HIV-positive versus 20/32 = 62% in
HIV-negative patients), without any correlation with CD4 counts.  Genotyping
of HCV in the 43 viraemic patients shows more frequent genotype 1 in the
HIV-seropositive group (14/23) than in the seronegative group (6/20).  Our
data emphasize that besides the role of the immunodeficiency status, the
genotypes of HCV might be involved in the differences observed in terms of HCV
RNA replication between the HIV-seropositive and seronegative haemophiliacs."

"Tissue Utilization at the Minnesota Lions' Eye Bank."  Cornea, November
1995;14(6):571-577.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Cornea, "The
purpose of this study was to examine the utilization of corneas procured by
the Minnesota Lions' Eye Bank to determine why corneas were excluded from
transplantation and to identify methods to safely increase the number of
tissues made available for transplantation.  We performed a retrospective
review of the eye bank charts of 2,382 corneas evaluated by the Minnesota
Lions' Eye Bank between December 1, 1992 and November 30, 1993.  During that
time 748 corneas (31%) were made available for transplantation; 1,597 (67%)
were directed toward research or training.  Thirty-seven corneas (1.5%) were
disposed of for safety reasons.  Six hundred and sixty of the corneas which
were excluded from transplantation (40%) were excluded for a donor aged over
75 years.  Three hundred and ninety-one corneas (24%) were rejected because of
a contraindication in the donor's past ocular or medical history.  Another 395
corneas (24%) were excluded for poor tissue quality.  The most common reason
for exclusion of tissue based on tissue quality was abnormalities seen on
specular microscopic examination (200 corneas).  Of interest, only 14 corneas
were rejected for low endothelial cell counts.  This review of our tissue
evaluation process has led us to reevaluate and change our policy regarding
exclusion of corneas for epithelial defects and arcus senilis.  These data
suggest that further evaluation of the abnormalities seen on specular
microscopic examination and their validity as exclusion criteria should be
undertaken.  Other areas for further evaluation are how to improve the
timeliness of tissue procurement and whether excluding all tissues over age 75
years and all postsurgical eyes is valid."  The corresponding author for this

Transfusion (Wound Drainage Blood)
Southern, E.P.; Huo, M.H.; Mehta, J.R.; Keggi, K.J.  "Unwashed Wound Drainage
Blood:  What Are We Giving Our Patients?"  Clinical Orthopaedics and Related
Research, November 1995;(320):235-246.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Clinical
Orthopaedics and Related Research, "Wound drainage blood was collected after
total joint arthroplasty was completed in 13 consecutive patients.  Peripheral
blood samples were collected in the recovery room and at 6 hours
postoperatively for all 13 patients.  A standard enzyme-linked immunosorbency
assay was done to quantify tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 alpha,
interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 levels in the samples.  At 6 hours
postoperatively, the levels of cytokines were elevated significantly in the
peripheral and drainage blood serum.  In particular, the drainage blood serum
had the most dramatic increase for all cytokines, which was significant.
Reinfusion of unwashed filtered postoperative wound drainage blood has been
shown not to be entirely benign; pyrogenic transfusion reaction is the most
commonly reported adverse effect, but hemodynamic instability with hypotension
and even myocardial infarction have been reported.  The cause of these adverse
events has not been defined clearly, but may be secondary to the infusion of
cytokines.  The present study showed the presence and significant elevation of
the cytokine levels in the wound drainage blood.  A comprehensive review of
the literature revealed that unwashed drainage blood is a relatively dilute
blood product lacking normal clotting factors and having numerous other
undesirable components that may mitigate against its routine use in lieu of
predeposited autologous or homologous blood.  This is of interest because
there is evidence indicating that wound drainage blood reinfusion may be
unnecessary in total joint arthroplasty when autologous blood is available.
Use of drains in this surgery also may be unnecessary and has been shown to
increase the amount of blood loss and the need for transfusion."  The

JUDGE POINTER APPROVES
NEW GLOBAL SETTLEMENT;
FIVE PLAINTIFFS OBJECT

     Five plaintiffs in the Lindsey class action on Jan. 9 filed
a motion for reconsideration with the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Alabama, following Judge Sam C. Pointer
Jr.'s Dec. 22 order approving the revised global settlement of
breast implant claims.  In re Silicone Gel Breast Implants
Products Liability Litigation, No. 926 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV 92-P-
10000-S (ND AL); Lindsey et al. v. Dow Corning Corp. et al.,
No. CV 94-P-11558-S; see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter,
Nov. 28, 1995.

     The plaintiffs contend that Order No. 27 is void on
procedural grounds and violates the plaintiffs' substantive legal
rights.

     The original $4.2 billion global settlement, approved by
Judge Pointer in 1994, collapsed when many more women than
expected sought benefits.  The new settlement, which includes
defendants Bristol-Myers Squibb, Baxter Healthcare, Minnesota
Mining & Manufacturing, McGhan Medical Corp. and Union Carbide,
calls for lower payments and includes more restrictive criteria
that claimants must meet to qualify for benefits.  However, the
payment levels set forth in the new settlement will not be
affected by the number of women who seek benefits.

     Under the new agreement, eligible participants are domestic
class members who have had at least one implant manufactured or
distributed by one of the settling defendants or their
predecessors or subsidiaries.  There are no provisions for
foreign claimants under the settlement, nor are children of
implant recipients eligible to participate with regard to their
own personal injury claims.  Claimants who previously opted out
of the original settlement have until Dec. 16, 1996, to withdraw
their exclusion and to register with the Claims Office.

     In his order, Judge Pointer said, "The Court concludes that,
for eligible participants, this revised settlement program
reduces the amount of 'ratcheting' that would otherwise occur
under terms of the Settlement and that, for persons not eligible
to participate, it preserves their rights under the Settlement to
opt out and, indeed, by providing some options to continue and
extend the suspension of statutes of limitation and repose, it
partially enhances those rights."

     In a separate order also issued Dec. 22, Judge Pointer
approved a question-and-answer booklet and list of implant brand
names that will be distributed as part of the notice program to
all claimants who have given their names and addresses to the
court, whether they are currently members of the Lindsey class or
have opted out of the original settlement.

     The five plaintiffs seeking to overturn the order are
Christina Johanna Adelaar, Johanna Maria Jagt-Hamerslag, Kathy
Lambert, Maria Engelhart-Nelissen and Nancy Pulcini.  According
to the motion, four are citizens of foreign countries and are not
eligible for benefits under the revised settlement, and the fifth
is a member of the Lindsey class who claims she will be prevented
from obtaining a prompt settlement of her claims if she opts out.

     The plaintiffs object that Judge Pointer issued the order
sua sponte, without a motion by any party, contrary to Rule 60(b)
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Further, the plaintiffs
assert, they are entitled to an evidentiary hearing before the
1994 order approving the global settlement is revised or vacated.
Finally, they argue, Order No. 27 is void because appeals from
the 1994 order are before the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals,
which must grant leave for the order to be modified.

     Order No. 27 violates the Fifth Amendment and equal
protection rights of the foreign plaintiffs, who were eligible
for benefits under the original settlement and who have relied
upon the 1994 order, the plaintiffs say.

     The motion was filed by Sybil Shainwald of the Law Offices
of Sybil Shainwald in New York City.

DOW CHEMICAL'S MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION IS
DENIED BY JUDGE POINTER

     Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr.'s order denying Dow Chemical's
motion for summary judgment on claims that it should be held
liable for alleged illnesses caused by Dow Corning's manufacture
of silicone gel breast implants will stand, the judge ruled in a
Dec. 26 order denying Dow's motion for reconsideration.  In re
Silicone Gel Breast Implants Products Liability Litigation,
No. 926 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV 92-P-10000-S (ND AL); see Breast
Implant Litigation Reporter, Aug. 8, 1995.

     Judge Pointer originally granted Dow Chemical's motion,
saying that the company had no special knowledge of alleged
hazards of Dow Corning's implants that would obligate Dow
Chemical to warn end users of the implants.  Dow Chemical and
Corning, Inc. are the sole shareholders of Dow Corning.

     However, Judge Pointer later vacated that order, finding new
evidence of Dow Chemical's involvement in the testing of
silicones that Dow Corning used in implant products.  Dow
Chemical sought reconsideration, contending that it performed
only two tests on a silicone compound for Dow Corning, and that
neither test involved suitability for medical implants.

     In his order, Judge Pointer said his ruling should stand
because there is no new evidence or change in the law that would
warrant vacating it.  He rejected Dow Chemical's claims that the
issue should be whether Dow Chemical specifically tested breast
implants, not just raw silicone, and that holding Dow Chemical
liable would violate public policy.

COURT DISMISSES SEVEN
CANADIAN SUITS FOR
FORUM NON CONVENIENS

     Seven suits filed in the United States by Canadian women who
received breast implants in Canada were dismissed Dec. 26 from
the multidistrict litigation in Alabama on the basis of forum non
conveniens.  In re Silicone Gel Breast Implants Products
Liability Litigation, No. 926 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV 92-P-10000-S
(ND AL).

     U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. cited the reasons
given in his April 25, 1995, order dismissing nearly all cases
filed by foreign plaintiffs, including two suits filed by
Canadian citizens (see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter,
April 28, 1995).

     The seven suits are: Ellis et al. v. Baxter Healthcare Corp.
et al., No. CV 93-P-14114-S; Pollyck et al. v. Baxter Healthcare
Corp. et al., No. CV 94-P-14115-S; Davis et al. v. Baxter
Healthcare Corp. et al., No. CV 93-P-14408-S; Martin et al. v.
Baxter Healthcare Corp. et al., No. CV 93-P-14409-S; Walker v.
McGhan Medical Corp., No. CV-94-P-10521-S; Chapin v. McGhan
Medical Corp et al., No. CV 94-P-11335-S; and two plaintiffs from
McIver et al. v. Dow Corning Corp. et al., No. CV 94-P-14600-S.
The suits were initially filed in Texas state court, removed to
federal court and ultimately transferred to the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama, which is overseeing
all federal breast implant litigation.

     In his April 25 order, Judge Pointer found that foreign
claimants from Canada, Australia and England have adequate
remedies available to them in their own court systems, and
therefore may not file suit in the United States.

     Judge Pointer's most recent order contains the same
conditions as the April 25 order with respect to the defendants,
namely that:

     " Each defendant will submit to jurisdiction in Canada and
accept service of process there;

     " Each defendant will be bound to pay any final judgment
against it;

     " If raising a statute of limitations defense, the
defendants will not include the period the suit was pending in
the United States; and

     " The defendants will not object to offered evidence that
would be admissible in a U.S. court.

     Judge Pointer also said his order is without prejudice to
plaintiffs filing proofs of claim in the Dow Corning bankruptcy.

DOW DEFENDANTS, 3M
FILE REPLY BRIEFS
WITH SIXTH CIRCUIT

     Transfer of cases against Dow Corning's shareholders, Dow
Chemical and Corning Inc., to the Eastern District of Michigan
will not bring breast implant litigation against the shareholders
to a grinding halt as breast implant plaintiffs claim, Dow
Corning and the shareholders told the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals in a Dec. 11 reply brief.  In re Dow Corning Corp.;
Lindsey v. O'Brien, Tanski, Tanser and Young et al., Nos. 95-
2034, 95-2106, 95-2082, 95-2084, and 95-2107 (6th Cir.); see
Breast Implant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 26, 1995.

     In a separate brief, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.
contended that the appellees are raising "red herring" issues to
confuse the court into ignoring the substantive issues.

     Earlier, the law firm of O'Quinn, Kerensky, McAninch &
Laminack, representing some 2,000 women who have opted out of the
global settlement of breast implant claims, argued that Dow
Corning Corp. is using a ruse to get cases against its non-
bankrupt parents transferred to the Eastern District of
Michigan.

     In a separate brief, the firm argues that 3M, Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. and Baxter Healthcare Corp. are not entitled to have
their cases transferred.

     Dow Corning Corp., one of the numerous defendants named in
breast implant lawsuits, filed for bankruptcy protection last May
in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
and sought transfer of the cases against it to the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Co-defendants named
in lawsuits with Dow Corning also sought transfer, arguing that
their cases are "related to" the Dow Corning bankruptcy.  U.S.
District Judge Denise Page Hood ruled on Sept. 12 that her court
does not have jurisdiction over breast implant claims against
nondebtor defendants.  The manufacturers appealed to the Sixth
Circuit.

     "Dow Chemical and Corning, Inc., not being in bankruptcy,
had no right to the benefits of the bankruptcy procedures," the
plaintiffs argue.  "Their lawyers, knowing this, filed no motion
to transfer because as non-bankrupt companies they had no
standing to file such a motion.  Thus, they got their subsidiary,
Dow Corning, to do it for them.  This ruse should not work.
These efforts to smuggle a transfer order for Dow Chemical and
Corning, Inc., should be rejected for the same reasons that the
motions to transfer filed by Bristol, Baxter and 3M should be
rejected."

     Responding to the arguments of 3M, Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Baxter, the plaintiffs contend that these companies are seeking
unprecedented court action that has never been allowed in any
mass tort bankruptcy case, including the asbestos-related
bankruptcies and the bankruptcy of intrauterine device maker A.H.
Robins.

     In addition, the plaintiffs contend, the companies' appeals
can be interpreted as seeking relief they never requested from
Judge Hood " the transfer of all breast implant cases against
them, not only cases in which Dow Corning is a co-defendant.

     Finally, the plaintiffs contend the manufacturers are
improperly seeking de novo review of Judge Hood's decision,
ignoring their burden of showing that Judge Hood's factual
findings were clearly erroneous.

SIXTH CIRCUIT BRIEFS, PART II

     Dow Corning, Dow Chemical and Corning Inc., in their reply
brief, reiterate their argument that transfer is necessary so
that claims against Dow Corning and the shareholders can be kept
together and pretrial proceedings can take place in an organized
and efficient manner.  Transfer is not an attempt to shield Dow
Chemical and Corning from tort liability, they argue.

     Responding to arguments raised by a group of California
plaintiffs, the Dow defendants argued that Judge Hood did not "
as the plaintiffs claim " remand the cases to state court
herself, but she merely advised the various federal courts to do
so when the cases returned to them.  For that reason, they also
found fault with the California plaintiffs' argument that the
appeals court lacks jurisdiction because orders remanding cases
to state courts are not appealable.

     Finally, Dow Chemical and Corning contend that, contrary to
appellees' arguments, they have standing to appeal.

     3M, in its reply brief, contends that the appellees are
attempting to divert the court's attention from the real issues
with arguments that transfer is a ruse to thwart breast implant
claims.  It is the plaintiffs' bar, not the nondebtor defendants,
who are trying to take "improper tactical advantage " of the Dow
Corning bankruptcy, 3M asserts.

     "Appellees' arguments on this appeal are further belied by
one inescapable fact " it was the plaintiffs' bar that filed
actions naming the Nondebtor Manufacturers and DCC as joint
tortfeasors in the breast implant lawsuits," 3M states.  "It was
the plaintiffs' bar that pursued the tactic of suing all of the
Manufacturers jointly and severally, asserting in many cases that
women had received implants from multiple manufacturers and that
the Manufacturers had allegedly conspired to withhold from women
information concerning the alleged health risks of such implants.
It is thus remarkable that Appellees now argue that the breast
implant claims they chose to assert against the Nondebtor
Manufacturers and DCC on a theory of joint and several liability
have somehow become unrelated cases that should be tried
separately now that DCC is in reorganization."

     The plaintiffs' briefs were filed by John M. O'Quinn,
Richard N. Laminack and Thomas W. Pirtle of O'Quinn, Kerensky,
McAninch & Laminack in Houston.

     3M is represented by Bruce R. Zirinsky and Greg A. Danilow

DCC SETTLES WITH HMR,
DOW CHEMICAL; ASKS
COURT TO OK AGREEMENT

     Dow Corning Corp. on Dec. 27 asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Bay City, MI, to approve a settlement it reached with Hoechst
Marion Roussel (HMR) and Dow Chemical Co. that would resolve
HMR's objections to the debtor's proposed settlements with
numerous insurance companies over coverage for breast implant
claims.  In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.);
see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 26, 1995.

     Hearings on the insurance settlements were conducted on
several dates in early December, but were continued pending
approval of the settlement with HMR and Dow Chemical.

     Dow Corning is seeking court approval of settlement
agreements with Zurich Insurance Co. and Zurich International
Ltd.; TIG Insurance Co. and certain other insurers; the London
Market Insurers; National Casualty Co.; Arab Insurance Co.;
Federal Insurance Co.; North River Insurance Co., United States
Fire Insurance Co. and International Surplus Lines Insurance Co.
(the North River Insurers); Algemene Verzekering Maatschappij
Diligentia N.V. Te Amsterdam; and Ludgate Insurance Co.

     HMR and Dow Chemical are named co-insureds on some of the
policies issued by these companies.  They objected to the
proposed settlements, arguing that any disbursements to Dow
Corning would reduce the amount of coverage available to them and
that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction to approve
such a settlement.

     Dow Corning says it has reached a settlement that will
resolve the objections of HMR and Dow Chemical.  According to the
Dec. 27 motion, HMR will relinquish any claims to the insurance
policies that compete with Dow Corning's breast implant claims,
in exchange for payments of 2% to 2-1/2% of funds recovered by
Dow Corning or Dow Chemical under the policies.  HMR will also
drop its objections to the pending insurance settlements, as well
as the previously approved Hartford and Royal settlements, which
are now on appeal.

     The settlement between Dow Corning and Dow Chemical calls
for establishment of an escrow fund that will contain the
proceeds of cash settlements between Dow Corning and the insurers
for policies in which Dow Chemical is a co-insured.  The
agreement calls for limits on disbursement of the funds or
determination of rights to the funds until after Dow Corning's
Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is confirmed, and sets the
conditions under which Dow Corning and Dow Chemical can access
the funds to pay claims.

     Dow Corning's motion was filed by Barbara J. Houser, Craig
J. Litherland and David P. McClain of Sheinfeld, Maley & Kay in
Dallas.

TORT COMMITTEE SEEKS TO
DISQUALIFY KIRKLAND &
ELLIS AS DCC COUNSEL

     Kirkland & Ellis must be disqualified from representing
debtor Dow Corning Corp. because the firm's simultaneous
representation of Dow Chemical Co., one of Dow Corning's parents,
poses a "significant and unacceptable" conflict of interest, the
Official Committee of Tort Claimants argued Dec. 27 in a motion
filed with the bankruptcy court in Bay City, MI.  In re Dow
Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.).

     The committee says Kirkland & Ellis (K&E) was approved by
the bankruptcy court as special counsel to the debtor under 11
U.S.C. Section 327(e), based in part on its assurance that its
simultaneous representation of Dow Chemical would not be a
conflict of interest.  Now, however, the committee claims,
"recent developments have illustrated that K&E's representations
are no longer correct."

     First, the committee argues, K&E is representing both Dow
Corning and Dow Chemical in the insurance coverage litigation in
the bankruptcy court and in Michigan state court.  The two
companies are attempting to access the same policies, under which
they are co-insureds " Dow Chemical for claims relating to its
Sarabond building material and Dow Corning for breast implant
claims, the committee says.  Allowing one company's claims will
necessarily deplete assets available to the other, the committee
states.

     The committee also notes that the two companies are taking
conflicting positions on liability for breast implant claims: Dow
Corning argues that Dow Chemical should share any liability,
while Dow Chemical contends that Dow Corning alone is
responsible.

     Most recently, the committee states, K&E, in its role as Dow
Chemical's counsel, is preparing to depose Dow Corning employees
whose depositions the firm defended in the breast implant
litigation.

     "The Debtor appears remarkably sanguine about the prospect
of its own principal defense counsel in effect litigating against
it on issues with a potential billion-dollar impact on the
estate," the committee says.  "...Since the Debtor seems
incapable of policing such conflicts, it is appropriate for the
Committee, as fiduciary for significant interests in the estate,
to bring the issue before the Court."

     The Tort Claimants Committee is represented by Alfred S.
Lurey and Dennis S. Meir of Kilpatrick & Cody in Atlanta; Marvin
E. Frankel, Kenneth H. Eckstein and Jeffrey S. Trachtman of
Kramer, Levin, Naftalis, Nessen, Kamin & Frankel in New York
City; and Lenard M. Parkins and Patrick L. Hughes of Verner,

OBJECTIONS FILED
TO PROPOSED MAY 1
BAR DATE

     The Official Committee of Tort Claimants, the Official
Committee of Unsecured Creditors, Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing Co., Medical Engineering Corp. and Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. (the MEC defendants), Baxter Healthcare Corp. and
Baxter International, and several Blue Cross/Blue Shield health
plans all filed responses in the Bay City, MI, bankruptcy court
Dec. 19 and 20 to Dow Corning's proposed bar date of May 1, 1996.
In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.); see Breast
Implant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 12, 1995.

     Dow Corning on Dec. 1 filed a motion seeking a deadline of
May 1, 1996, for filing proofs of claim against its bankruptcy
estate, and seeking court permission to use claim forms that
differ from the official forms.  In addition, the company filed
its proposed plan to notify all potential creditors and personal
injury claimants of the deadline.

Tort Claimants Committee

     The Tort Claimants Committee contends that a bar date for
breast implant claims will waste assets of Dow Corning's estate
while providing no new or useful information.

     "A bar date for these claims would be expensive, costing
almost $7 million for the Debtor's proposed notice program and
undoubtedly many millions more for the processing and review of
filed claims, and would delay this case for many months," the
committee states.  "A breast implant bar date would improvidently
cut off the claims of many thousands of Breast Implant Recipients
who could far more effectively be reached by notice at a later
and more appropriate stage in the reorganization."

     The value of breast implant claims can be calculated using
currently available information, the committee says.

     Setting a bar date for non-breast implant product liability
claims is also "unwarranted and prejudicial," the committee says.

     "[I]t appears that the principal effect of such a bar date
would be to bar prematurely the great majority of as-yet-
unmatured Other Product Claims, whose holders would have little
incentive in the circumstances to file proofs of claim.  The
problem is compounded by the onerous and intrusive evidentiary
requirements that the Debtor seeks to impose on Other Product
Claimants at the proof of claim stage " the effect of which would
be to deter most claimants from filing."

     Such a scheme violates Bankruptcy Rules 3001(a) and (c),
which require that the official form be used by all creditors,
the committee states.

     The committee also argues that the May 1 date will coincide
with the notice to breast implant claimants regarding the
recently approved revised global settlement, which will result in
confusion and deter women from filing proofs of claim.

BAR DATE OBJECTIONS, PART II

     The committee also objects that:

     " no provisions are made for notice to foreign claimants;

     " there are no provisions for maintaining the
     confidentiality of information required to be disclosed on
     the Breast Implant and Other Product claim forms;

     " the Breast Implant claim form does not advise women with
     non-Dow Corning implants that they may have a claim against
     Dow Corning as a supplier of the silicone gel used in the
     implant; and

     " the definition of "Other Products" is vague.

Unsecured Creditors Committee

     Although the committee said it does not object to the idea
of a bar date being set at some point, it said a bar date is not
necessary now and will substantially delay the bankruptcy
proceedings.

     A bar order is neither required for either discharge under
Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code nor for an estimation
proceeding under Section 157(b), the committee argues.

     The committee also objects that the proposed legal
notification program is "totally unwarranted" because other
notice will have to be given in the case " specifically, notice
of the confirmation hearing.  In addition, the committee contends
that Dow Corning has not submitted the actual content of the
notification program for court approval, leaving the court unable
to judge whether the program meets legal standards.

     With respect to the Canadian notification program, the
committee notes that the bankruptcy court does not have power to
enforce the automatic stay outside the borders of the United
States.  The committee, therefore, says the notification to
Canadian claimants should specify that Canadians who file proofs
of claim in the bankruptcy are precluded from pursuing suits in
the Canadian court system, and conversely that pursuing a lawsuit
will prevent participation in the bankruptcy.

     Finally, the committee objected to certain aspects of Dow
Corning's proposed claim forms.

The MEC Defendants

     The MEC defendants complained that although they expect to
file claims against Dow Corning for contribution for cases in
which they are found to be jointly and severally liable, it is
unclear which claim form they are required to file " the Breast
Implant Claim Form or the Commercial Claim Form.

     The MEC defendants also noted the absence of any reference
to potential claims against Dow Corning as a supplier of gel.

     "The MEC Defendants respectfully submit that additional
categories must be added to the Breast Implant Claim Form to
address the Debtor's liabilities arising from the supply of gel,"
they stated.

BAR DATE OBJECTIONS, PART III

     Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing

     3M also objected to Dow Corning's proposed claim form
system, because the proposed forms "do not appropriately or
sufficiently provide for the type and nature of the claims that
3M intends to assert," the company said.

     In addition, 3M argued that the definition of "breast
implant" should be expanded to include all breast implants,
whether manufactured by Dow Corning or another company.  Such a
move is necessary, 3M explained, "in order to address the
universe of claims that have been asserted jointly against DCC
and 3M, including, for example, multiple implant claims and
conspiracy claims."

     3M said it takes no position at this time on the
establishment of the May 1 bar date or on Dow Corning's proposed
notice program.

Baxter Healthcare

     Baxter also seeks modification of the breast implant claim
form to include reference to women who may have claims against
Dow Corning as a gel supplier.

     The form "cannot be fairly completed, much less verified
under penalty of perjury, by (a) a claimant who is unaware of the
identity of her implant manufacturer, (b) a claimant who is
unaware of the identity of the gel supplier or even (c) a
claimant who knows that DCC manufactured the silicone gel
contained in an implant manufactured by another company."

     Baxter also says the notice program should inform women that
non-Dow Corning implants may contain Dow Corning gel.

Blue Cross/Blue Shield Health Plans

     Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Alabama, Blue Shield of California, and Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of Minnesota said they agree with the Tort Claimants
Committee that setting a bar date for breast implant claims is
premature.

     The health plans also contend that Dow Corning has made no
provision for their filing proofs of claim.  They say they have a
right to be reimbursed for payments made to each of their members
who has received breast implant-related services, regardless of
whether the member files a proof of claim against Dow Corning.

     The Tort Claimants Committee is represented by Alfred S.
Lurey and Dennis S. Meir of Kilpatrick & Cody in Atlanta; Marvin

NY PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO
LIFT AUTOMATIC STAY
TO LIQUIDATE CLAIMS

     New York breast implant plaintiffs on Dec. 26 filed a motion
with the bankruptcy court in Bay City, MI, asking that the
automatic stay be lifted so that they can proceed with, or in
some cases initiate, lawsuits against Dow Corning Corp.  In re
Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.).

     The plaintiffs argue that they are only seeking to liquidate
their claims, not execute on them.  Once the claims are
liquidated, they say, the claims will become subject to
bankruptcy court jurisdiction as core proceedings.

     The plaintiffs are those whose cases were originally filed
in the New York Supreme Court or the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York and consolidated before the Hon.
Joan B. Lobis for pretrial coordination and discovery.

     The plaintiffs' suits are currently unliquidated claims over
which the bankruptcy court has no jurisdiction, the plaintiffs
state.  After the claims are reduced to judgment, they will be
considered liquidated claims and will fall under bankruptcy
jurisdiction as core proceedings, they say.

     The plaintiffs argue that they are now "burdened with a
continuing 'stay' of all litigation unless plaintiffs agree to
dismiss Dow Corning with prejudice from all their actions.  Since
Judge [Sam C.] Pointer [overseeing the multidistrict litigation
proceedings] will not allow plaintiffs to proceed with any
litigation unless they agree to forfeit their rights against the
Dow Corning bankruptcy estate, plaintiffs have no recourse but to
seek relief from the automatic bankruptcy stay so their lawsuits
can move forward."

     The motion was filed by Dawn S. DeWeil of Schneider,
Kleinick, Weitz, Damashek & Shoot in New York City.

DCC OBJECTS TO FEE
APPLICATIONS, HEARING
SET FOR JAN. 18

     Dow Corning Corp. on Dec. 21 objected to the first interim
fee applications filed by several professional firms for services
to the estate.  In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI
Bankr.).

     A hearing on the matter is set for Thursday, Jan. 18.

     Dow Corning said it objects to the following requests for
fees and expenses:

     " $50,008 requested by Ernst & Young, which Dow Corning
claims was for services performed prior to the effective date of
retention.  Ernst & Young is seeking a total of $790,188 in fees
and $43,791 in expenses.

     " $102,000 requested by the law firm of Kilpatrick & Cody,
which Dow Corning also claims is for pre-retention services.  Dow
Corning objects to another $15,000 requested for expenses
associated with attendance at an American Trial Lawyers
Association conference on breast implant litigation.  Kilpatrick
& Cody is asking for a total of $774,133 in fees and $91,059.26
in expenses.

     " $25,544 in fees, out of a total of $151,661.50 in fees and
$19,748.69 in expenses, requested by Bricker & Eckler.  The
disputed amount was for pre-retention services, Dow Corning
states.

     " $41,560.97 in allegedly unsupported and unreimbursable
expenses for various members of the Tort Claimants Committee.

     " $25,562 requested by Kramer, Levin, Naftalis, Nessen,
Kamin & Frankel for 80.2 hours in responding to Dow Corning's
motion for sanctions against the law firm of O'Quinn, Kerensky,
McAninch & Laminack and Richard Laminack.  Dow Corning claims
that Kramer Levin's filings were duplicative and unnecessary, and
provided no benefit to the debtor's estate.  Kramer Levin is
seeking a total of $1,234,323.63 in fees and $157,982.99 in
expenses.

     Dow Corning said it saved $103,324 resolving other
objections through an informal process of negotiation.

     The objections were filed by Barbara J. Houser, Craig J.
Litherland and Millie A. Sall of Sheinfeld, Maley & Kay in

DCC SEEKS PERMISSION TO
GIVE IMPLANT SAMPLES TO
UNIVERSITY FOR STUDY

     Dow Corning Corp. on Dec. 19 asked the bankruptcy court in
Bay City, MI, for permission to give 160 pairs of breast implants
to a university that is conducting a study that Dow Corning
believes will assist the court in estimating rupture claims.  In
re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.)

     Dow Corning states that, in 1992, a "leading American
university" began a study of the structural integrity and rupture
rate of breast implants.  The study's methodology includes
comparing Dow Corning implants that have been explanted from
their recipients with new, unused samples of DCC implants that
were manufactured in the same lots as the explants.

     Dow Corning had no role in initiating or establishing the
study's protocol and has no rights with respect to the results,
Dow Corning states.  The company also says that donating the
implants to the study would be consistent with pre-bankruptcy
discovery orders issued by various courts relating to

JUDGE ALLOWS DCC TO
EXTEND CANADIAN
LIMITATIONS PERIOD

     U.S  Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Spector on Dec. 7 granted
Dow Corning Corp.'s motion to enter into a stipulation extending
the statute of limitations in a Canadian breast implant class
action.  In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512 (ED MI Bankr.);
see Breast Implant Litigation Reporter, Dec. 26, 1995.

               On Nov. 21, Dow Corning filed a motion relating to a class
action pending in the Supreme Court of British Columbia,
Harrington v. Dow Corning Corp. et al., No. C954330.  All of the
approximately 15 other defendants have agreed to extend the
limitations period from Dec. 31, 1995, the date provided for in
the British Columbia Class Proceedings Act, until April 30, 1996.
However, Dow Corning said, its bankruptcy filing and the
associated automatic stay raised a question as to whether the
company could unilaterally enter into such a stipulation.

     The Canadian court had planned to hold a hearing Dec. 13 on
certifying the class with respect to Dow Corning; that hearing
was continued until next year.  All of the other defendants,
citing the need for more time to prepare for the certification
hearing, stipulated to the extension.  Dow Corning argued that
it, too, needed additional time to prepare for arguments.

     Judge Spector found the relief requested was appropriate.

CANADIAN SUPREME COURT
UPHOLDS DCC'S LIABILITY
IN BREAST IMPLANT SUIT

     Dow Corning is liable for failing to warn a patient of the
possibility that her breast implant could rupture as a result of
normal, everyday activities, a 5-2 majority of the Canadian
Supreme Court ruled Dec. 21.  Dow Corning Corp. v. Hollis,
No. 23776 (Canadian Sup. Ct.).

     The majority said Dow Corning could have met that duty by
warning the surgeon who performed the implantation, but failed to
warn the doctor.  The dissenting opinion said the patient should
be required to prove that the doctor, had he been properly warned
by Dow Corning, would have passed the information on to her.

     In 1983, Susan Hollis had two gel-filled, low profile, round
Silastic implants, manufactured by Dow Corning, implanted by Dr.
John R. Birch to correct breast abnormalities.  At a later date,
another surgeon removed the implants and found that one of them
had ruptured but there was no evidence of the silicone envelope
that had surrounded the ruptured implant.  Subsequently, Hollis
underwent bilateral subcutaneous mastectomies and immediate
replacement with saline implants.

     Hollis filed suit, claiming that Dow Corning was negligent
in the manufacture or design of the implant that ruptured and
negligent in failing to give adequate warnings to the medical
profession or the public of the possibility that the implants
could rupture.  She claimed that Birch had been negligent in
failing to warn her of the risks of implant rupture and that the
second doctor had been negligent in failing to exercise adequate
care to prevent implant rupture during explantation.

               Following an 18-day trial, the trial judge found that Dow
Corning was negligent in the manufacture of the implant; that it
was unnecessary to decide whether Dow Corning was negligent in
failing to warn adequately; that neither doctor had been
negligent; that Birch was under no duty to warn Hollis of the
possibility of implant rupture; and that there was no contract of
sale and purchase between Birch and Hollis with respect to the
implants.

     Hollis was awarded C$95,000 for non-pecuniary damages, past
loss of income and for future loss of income.

     On appeal, the Court of Appeal found lack of evidence for
the conclusion that the implant rupture was caused by Dow
Corning's negligence.  However, it found that Dow Corning
possessed relevant information with respect to the risk of
rupture that it did not make available to the medical community.
The court reversed the dismissal of the negligence action against
Birch, ordered a new trial and dismissed Hollis' cross-appeal
that the damages award was inordinately low.

     On appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court, the sole issue was
whether Dow Corning is liable to Hollis because it failed to warn
Birch.

     The majority first found that Dow Corning was under a duty
to warn of the risks of unexplained ruptures at the time Hollis
received her implants.  It noted that Dow Corning had at that
point received between 48 and 61 reports of unexplained ruptures,
but that it did not begin warning doctors of this phenomenon for
another two years.

     Next, the majority said Dow Corning could have escaped
liability, if it had adequately warned Birch, under the learned
intermediary doctrine.  Dow Corning contended that it should not
be liable unless Hollis could prove that Birch, had he been
properly informed of the rupture risk, would have passed the
information on to Hollis.  However, the majority rejected this
contention, finding that it would require the plaintiff to prove
a hypothetical situation.

     "It is clear from the record that Ms. Hollis' right to
informed consent was not respected in this case," the majority
said.  "We know that Dow's failure to warn was a cause of her
injury; whether Dr. Birch's actions in the hypothetical situation
posited by Dow might also have been a cause is not a matter for
Ms. Hollis to prove."

     The appropriate test, the majority said, is a subjective
test: would Hollis have gone ahead with the implant surgery if
she had been adequately warned, not the objective test of what a
"reasonable woman" would have done.  The majority found that
Hollis proved she would not have had the surgery if she had been
warned.

HOLLIS, PART II

     "Simply put," the majority stated, "I do not think a
manufacturer should be able to escape liability for failing to
give a warning it was under a duty to give, by simply presenting
evidence tending to establish that even if the doctor had been
given the warning, he or she would not have passed it on to the
patient, let alone putting an onus on the plaintiff to do so.
Adopting such a rule would, in some cases, run the risk of
leaving the plaintiff with no compensation for her injuries.  She
would not be able to recover against a doctor who had not been
negligent with respect to the information he or she did have; yet
she also would not be able to recover against a manufacturer who,
despite having failed in its duty to warn, could escape liability
on the basis that, had the doctor been appropriately warned, he
or she would not have passed the information on to the plaintiff.
Our tort law should not be held to contemplate such an anomalous
result."

     The dissent first said that use of the subjective test is
improper because it fails to account for the "inherent
unreliability of the plaintiff's self-serving assertion."

     "It is not simply a question as to whether the plaintiff is
believed," the dissent said.  "The plaintiff may be perfectly
sincere in stating that in hindsight she believed that she would
not have consented to the operation.  This is not a statement of
fact that, if accepted, concludes the matter.  It is an opinion
about what the plaintiff would have done in respect of a
situation that did not occur....  In evaluating the opinion, the
trier of fact must discount its probity not only by reason of its
self-serving nature, but also by reason of the fact that it is
likely to be colored by the trauma occasioned by the failed
procedure.  For this reason, the most reliable approach in
determining what would in fact have occurred is to test the
plaintiff's assertion by reference to objective evidence as to
what a reasonable person would have done."

     Next, the dissent said that "well established tort
principles" require Hollis to prove that her injuries would not
have occurred had Dow Corning properly warned Birch.

     "In other words," the dissent said, "Ms. Hollis must show
that her doctor would have warned her of any dangers that had
been brought to his attention and that if warned she would have
refused the operation.  Absent this form of proof, it cannot be
said with any degree of certainly that the failure of Dow to warn
physicians was the cause of the unfortunate injuries suffered by
Ms. Hollis."

     The dissent said a new trial should have been ordered
because the majority improperly resolved factual issues that are
the province of the trial court.
               Hollis was represented by Donald J. McKinlay of Lang
Michener Lawrence & Shaw in Vancouver, BC.  Dow Corning was
represented by Derek J. Mullan and David W. Donohoe of Clark,
Wilson in Vancouver.

OR JUDGE PARTIALLY
DISMISSES SUIT OVER
CONFIDENTIAL AGREEMENT

     A suit brought by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.
against a breast implant recipient and her attorneys for
allegedly revealing the amount of a confidential settlement
agreement was dismissed in part by a federal judge in Oregon on
Nov. 30.  Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. v. Thies et al.,
No. 95-1075-JE (D OR).

     Magistrate Judge John Jelderks of the U.S. District Court
for the District of Oregon granted a motion by defendant attorney
Michael L. Williams and his firm, Williams & Troutwine, P.C., to
dismiss 3M's claims for declaratory relief, negligence and
intentional interference with the company's economic advantage
and business relations.

     Judge Jelderks, however, denied the defendants' motion to
dismiss 3M's claim alleging that the defendants breached their
contractual agreement not to disclose the amount of a proposed
settlement.

     The present litigation involves a settlement reached between
3M and defendant Marjorie A. Thies over injuries Thies allegedly
suffered from her 3M breast implants.  Williams served as her
attorney in that action, which was settled in June 1995.  Under
the terms of the agreement, Thies was to receive a certain sum of
money by July 11, 1995.  Thies and her attorneys allegedly agreed
not to disclose the amount of the settlement.

     3M filed the present action on July 25, 1995, alleging that
Thies and her attorneys breached the confidentiality provision of
the settlement by disclosing the amount of the agreement.  The
company also claimed that Williams & Troutwine intentionally
interfered with 3M's prospective economic advantage and business
relations in connection with the silicone gel implant products
liability litigation by disclosing the amount of the settlement.

     Williams & Troutwine moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that
dismissal was appropriate pursuant to the abstention doctrine in
Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).  The firm also said the
suit should be stayed under the abstention doctrine in Colorado
River Water Conservation District v. United States, 424 U.S. 800
(1976).  3M's claims for failure to state a claim upon which
relief can be granted should also be dismissed, the firm argued.

     In his opinion, Judge Jelderks concluded that the court
should abstain from considering 3M's claim for declaratory
judgment, but should not abstain from considering the remainder
of the company's claims.

     "The most important element of this claim " the assertion
that 3M is not obligated to pay the Thieses in accordance with
the settlement agreement " was necessarily considered, and
rejected, in state court proceedings," the judge said.  "Review
of that conclusion is now pending in the Oregon appellate
system."

     Under these circumstances, Judge Jelderks said, the
principles of comity and federalism underlying in the Younger
decision favor abstention from consideration of 3M's first claim.

     "Oregon has an important interest in providing a forum for
the final resolution of issues raised, and decided, in the first
instance in its judicial system," the judge said.  "The state has
an important interest in providing that forum without concern
that duplicative litigation in a federal court might yield a
different result or otherwise put in question the finality of
state court judgments."

THIES, PART II

     In concluding that abstention from consideration of 3M's
first claim is appropriate, Judge Jelderks said the state has an
important interest in determining whether parties have
conclusively resolved the issues giving rise to litigation in its
courts, and in providing the appellate forum in which the
conclusions of its trial courts are tested.

     However, the judge said that Younger abstention is not
appropriate as to the balance of 3M's claims because these claims
raise issues that the state court was not required to reach in
deciding whether to grant the Thieses' motion for summary
judgment on the supplemental complaint.

     "There is neither an action pending in state court involving
all of the parties involved in this federal action, nor a pending
state proceeding in which 3M can pursue those claims not
inevitably addressed by the state court's conclusion that 3M was
not excused from performing its obligations under the settlement
agreement," Judge Jelderks said.

     The judge also held that Colorado River abstention is
inapplicable to the present litigation because no concurrent
state court action joins all the parties in the present
litigation.  In Colorado River, the court concluded that federal
courts should sometimes abstain from exercising jurisdiction when
concurrent state proceedings are pending.

     Judge Jelderks accepted the defendants' contention that 3M's
negligence claim should be dismissed for failure to state a claim
upon which relief may be granted.  Citing Hale v. Groce, 304 Or.
281, 284, 744 P.2d 1289 (1987), the judge said a party is not
ordinarily liable for negligently causing strictly economic harm
to another.

     "Oregon cases simply cannot be read as imposing upon counsel
or their clients some special duty to further the economic
interests of the adverse party," Judge Jelderks said.  "Hale does
not support 3M's position."

     The judge accepted the defendants' argument that 3M failed
to state an actionable intentional interference claim because it
cannot plead the requisite business relationship, and because it
cannot plead or prove that any alleged interference stemmed from
an improper motive.

     "Having reviewed Oregon cases discussing this tort, as well
as the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977) and relevant
treatises, I am convinced that 3M does not have the kind of
business or professional relationship with those allegedly
injured by its products that is protected by an intentional
interference cause of action," Judge Jelderks said.

     Representing 3M was William B. Crow and Jeffrey D. Austin of
Miller, Nash, Wiener, Hager & Carlsen of Portland, OR.
Representing Thies was William A. Gaylord of Gaylord & Eyerman,
P.C. in Portland.  Counsel for Williams and Troutwine, P.C. was
Donald W. McEwen and Jonathan M. Radmacher of McEwen, Gisvold,
Rankin, Carter & Streinz in Portland.

Cancer Vaccines (Pancreatic Carcinoma)
Vaccination with Mutant Ras Peptides Induces T-Cell Response


Pancreatic carcinoma patients carrying a ras mutation exhibited T-cell
responsiveness after vaccination with the corresponding mutant RAS peptides.

Because CD4 and CD8 T cells specific for a single ras mutation have been
described, and because mutant p21 RAS can be recognized by human T cells,
mutant p21 RAS represents an exclusive tumor-specific antigen.  These findings
suggest that RAS peptide vaccination of cancer patients with a verified ras
mutation might be used as a specific immunotherapy.

Marianne K.  Gjertsen et al.  vaccinated pancreatic cancer patients exhibiting
a ras mutation with a synthetic RAS peptide in an effort to influence the
clinical course of the disease ("Vaccination with Mutant RAS Peptides and
Induction of T-Cell Responsiveness in Pancreatic Carcinoma Patients Carrying
the Corresponding ras Mutation," The Lancet, November 25,
1995;346(8987):1399-1400).

"Results indicate that specific T-cell responses against mutations uniquely
harbored in tumor cells can be induced in cancer patients by vaccination,"
stated Gjertsen et al.

Five patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
with ras mutations were enrolled in this clinical trial.  Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (1-4x10(9)) were collected by leukapheresis and loaded with
a synthetic RAS peptide encompassing residues 5-21 of p21 RAS and
corresponding to the mutation in the patients tumor tissue.

Patients were vaccinated on day 0 and boosted on days 14 and 35.  Additional
boosters were given every 4-6 weeks.  None of the patients exhibited any toxic
reactions or side-effects after vaccination.

None of the patients exhibited T-cell responsiveness to any of the RAS
peptides tested before the protocol started, although they showed normal
T-cell responses against other test antigens.  Two of the five patients
exhibited T-cell response to RAS peptides in their peripheral blood
mononuclear cells around day 40 after the onset of the vaccination protocol,
noted the authors.

The T-cell response was transient, and disappeared during the following weeks.
Repeated vaccinations did not result in a reappearance of detectable
responding T cells in the peripheral blood.

Although puzzled at first by the lack of detectable T-cell response, the
authors determined that the tumor-specific T cells elicited by RAS peptide
vaccination were homing to the tumor and being selectively removed from
circulation.

No major therapeutic response was observed in the any of the patients,
including the two who exhibited brief T-cell responses.  The authors felt that
this was due to the terminal stage of the disease in the patients.  All the
patients had large tumor burdens and progressively deteriorating immune
systems, with life expectancies of only three to four months.

Tumor tissue taken from the two responding patients after they died showed
that lymphocyte infiltration was prominent and was mainly constituted by T
cells.  This finding was compatible with the explanation that the RAS-specific
T cells elicited by the vaccination may have homed in to the tumors of these
patients, noted the authors.

They also noted that vaccination by a single tumor-specific epitope may not be
sufficient in these circumstances as the therapeutic vaccine may have been too
little, too late.  Ongoing studies in patients with minimal residual disease
could provide a clinical setting allowing for more careful evaluation of
immune responses and the potential for clinical benefits of RAS peptide
vaccine, noted the authors.

"Our method for vaccination is novel," concluded Gjertsen et al.  "We injected
large amounts of peptide-pulsed mononuclear cells.  The rational is that a
fraction of these cells (i.e., pulsed dendritic cells and monocytes) will end
up in lymphoid organs, where the actual T-cell stimulation will take place.
Two and three rounds of vaccination seemed to be sufficient to break the state
of unresponsiveness to the mutant RAS peptides in [the two] patients [who
responded]."

This study was an extension of preliminary research done by these same authors
which was presented at the International Symposium on Cancer Vaccines, held
October 3-5, 1994.  At that time, they stated "Our results indicate that
immunotherapy targeted against neoplastic cells carrying ras mutations is
possible, and a protocol based on loading professional antigen presenting
cells with synthetic RAS peptides is currently being tested in a clinical
setting."

This research was supported by the Norwegian Cancer Society, the Norwegian
Research Council for Science and the Humanities, and Pronova, Norway.

Cancer Gene Therapy
Adenovirus-Mediated Cytokine Gene Therapy Successful in Murine Model


A murine breast cancer model has exhibited effective tumor suppression with
adenovirus-mediated cytokine gene therapy.

Separate studies presented at the 4th International Conference on Gene Therapy
of Cancer, held November 9-11, 1995, showed effective cancer immunotherapy
could be obtained by using of adenoviral vectors to administer the cytokines
interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, or IL-12.

C.L.  Addison et al.  and J.  Bramson et al.  coauthored separate, but related
studies, using a murine mammary carcinoma model to show the effectiveness of
cytokines in cancer immunotherapy.

"Intratumoral (i.t.)  injection of adenoviral vectors expressing cytokines may
be an effective immunotherapy of cancer resulting in protection from
metastatic disease," noted Addison et al.

Polyoma middle T transgenic mice were inoculated with mammary carcinoma cells.
Adenovirus vectors were created that expressed either IL-2 (AdCAIL-2), IL-4
(AdCAIL-4) or IL-12 (AdmIL.12.1).  After the mammary tumors were palpable, the
mice were injected i.t.  with the cytokine expressing vectors (one vector per
set of mice).

Of the animals that received AdCAIL-2, 54 percent underwent complete tumor
regression; 53 percent of the mice receiving AdCAIL-4 underwent complete tumor
regression; and 29 percent of the mice receiving AdmIL.12.1 underwent complete
regression.

Although the response rates were similar for the AdCAIL-2 and AdCAIL-4
vectors, the kinetics for the regression were markedly different.  Regression
induced by AdCAIL-2 occurred within four weeks whereas regression following
AdCAIL-4 required eight to 10 weeks, noted the authors.

In contrast, animals treated with AdmIL.12.1 exhibited a reduced rate of
complete tumor regression in spite of the observation that 100 percent showed
some type of response to the IL-12 cytokine.

When the animals that experienced total cure were rechallenged with fresh
inoculations of tumor, the IL-2 and IL-4 treated animals had a 100 percent
resistance rate.  In contrast, the IL-12 treated animals only experience a 66
percent resistance rate.

The authors suggested reason for IL-12 having a lower response rate was that
although it produces potent enhancement of CTL activity, it is a weak
stimulator of T cell proliferation.  The reemergence of tumors after
AdmIL.12.1 could have been due to inadequate numbers of responder cells within
the tumor at the time of rechallenge.

Combination of treatment with cytokines that stimulate T cells (i.e., IL-2)
could allow for increased and prolonged regression rates, suggested the
authors.

"Our studies indicate that intratumoral (i.t.)  administration of adenovirus
vectors expressing IL-12 alone or in combination with other cytokines will be
extremely useful in the treatment of cancer and management of metastatic
disease," concluded Bramson et al.

Work by Bramson et al.  on IL-12 was supported by grants from the MRC and NCI
Canada and London Life Insurance.

The authors for both studies can be reached at the Departments of Biology and
Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton Ontario, Canada.

See the September 25, 1995, issue of Vaccine Weekly for a synopsis of related
earlier research by Addison et al.  that was published in the August 29, 1995
issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 92(18):8522-26.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
"New" ACTG Moves Forward


Can the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaur
too large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?

According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - University
of Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization has
accomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the Twentieth
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,
D.C.

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)
responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.

But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs in
adults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and for
moving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDS
therapies.

DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of the
ACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since the
changes took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms were
valid, but also stressed the group's many achievements.

"We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said.
"But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is the
preeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together a
tremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."

Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for the
treatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTG
efforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way.

"This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugs
work," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."

Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combination
therapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the new
protease inhibitor saquinavir.

He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings
"to tell us what we need to do."

The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  But
most importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by which
it generates clinical trial protocols.

"One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving like
civil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processes
that prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.

The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult section
has only three committees making research decisions.  These three Research
Agenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and the
Opportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - the
Pharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient Care
Committee - will now be established as standing resource committees within
each of the three main RACs.

There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will be
centralized control of both resources and laboratories.

Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing the
ACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised of
the various committee chairs.

Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,
receiving their funds directly from DAIDS.

"Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "I
think this will work very well."

But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue to
change.

"Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," he
said.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."

He called for the active participation of each investigator.

"Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executive
committee members," Schooley said.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

Drug Development (Antiviral)
Virus-Neutralizing RNAs Offer Potential as Antiviral Therapies


An in vitro selection process of RNA analogs derived from infectious viral
particles turns up elements with antiviral activity.

Current drug development techniques are dependent on the discovery of useful
agents.  Compounds with antibacterial or antiviral activity are often found
through the empirical screening of synthetic and natural compounds or the
logical design of a drug based on structures of viral and cellular proteins.
Unfortunately, empirical screening is tedious and inefficient, and logical
drug design, although promising, has not produced an abundance of successful
compounds.

Weihua Pan et al.  extended a selection-amplification procedure, previously
used to isolate RNA and DNA molecules, to target an intact virus in hopes of
discovering RNA analogs that could be developed as antiviral drugs ("Isolation
of Virus-Neutralizing RNAs from a Large Pool of Random Sequences," Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences, December 5, 1995;92(25):11509-13).

"The isolation of RNAs and RNA analogs that are effective against diverse
viral strains will be particularly necessary for inhibiting viruses such as
HIV, which has a high mutation rate and readily develops drug-resistant
strains," stated Pan et al.  "Such selection is possible and practical because
a very large structurally diverse library is used and the selection is a rapid
process."

The authors noted that there is great potential to select for molecules that
bind defined targets with high affinity and specificity due to the structural
complexity of a combinatorial sequence library of single-stranded RNA
oligonucleotides.  Due to technological advances, selected RNA molecules can
be amplified and subjected to further selection.  Multiple cycles of selection
and amplification can lead to the isolation of the best target-binding RNA
molecules from the library.

Among the family of Retroviradae (which includes HIV), the rous sarcoma virus
(RSV) has been extensively studied.  All Retroviridae viruses are envelope
viruses which use surface glycoproteins to bind to a specific receptor on a
susceptible cell and for fusion with the cellular membrane of the host.

As a model, the authors chose to target intact RSV in order to isolate the RNA
molecules and the nuclease-resistant RNA analogs that specifically bind and
neutralize this virus.

RSV was used to demonstrate that antiviral RNA and RNA analogs could be
systematically and effectively isolated from a large pool of random sequences
without prior knowledge of the structures of the viral proteins.  First, they
used intact viral particles to select from the sequence pool the RNAs and RNA
analogs that bind specifically to the virus.  Then they screened the selected
molecules for the ability to neutralize the virus.

"We reason that by binding to virus, some of the selected RNAs and RNA analogs
may change the structures of viral surface proteins so that these proteins can
no longer function in steps critical for viral infection, such as viral
attachment and virus-cell membrane fusion," stated Pan et al.  "Alternatively,
some of the structural changes may trigger pathways to inhibit the steps which
normally occur after virus internalization, such as the uncoating and the
expression of the virus genome."

J.A.  Levy et al.  (Am.  Soc.  Microbiol., 1994;153-158) and N.J.  Dimmock et
al.  (Curr.  Top.  Microbiol.  Immunol., 1992;183:1-149) suggested the
possibilities in both of these avenues in some of their earlier work.

Using infectious viral particles, RNA and ribonuclease-resistant RAN analogs
that bound and neutralized RSV were isolated from a large pool of random
sequences by multiple cycles of in vitro selection.  Because RSV imposes
permeation problems, the selected RNAs were targeted to inhibit RSV infection
by binding to the virus surface, and not by entering the virus itself.

The sequences chosen completely neutralized the virus at concentrations of
0.16 (micro)M.  Of the 19 selected sequences isolated to be concentrated, five
of them inhibited RSV infection after cloning.  These five RNA and RNA analogs
neutralized the RSV by interacting with the virus itself.  They did not
adversely affect the host cells used in the in vitro experiments.

A potential problem with developing RNA as a therapeutic agent is the rapid
degradation of unmodified RNA by ribonucleases in vivo, noted the authors.
They suggested solving this problem by incorporating modified nucleotides into
the RNA chain.

The strain of RSV used during the experiments was the Prague A.  After testing
the selected RNAs against a different strain, the Prague C, the authors found
that the RNA analogs inhibited infection of this strain also, although at
concentrations 15-20 times higher.

Future methods of RNA selection could be performed by alternating between
several strains of virus during the different cycles of selection to
specifically isolate the RNAs and RNA analogs that could bind to several
diverse strains of the virus.  This could be particularly helpful when it
comes to treating viruses with a history of multiple mutations such as HIV,
noted the authors.

Several advantages were noted by the authors for the use of intact biological
entities (infectious virus particles) instead of viral proteins:

* Selection by intact viral particles does not require the full understanding
of all the ways that a virus can infect its host.  If selection is made by an
isolated viral protein, the selection is limited to only the cases in which
proteins responsible for viral infection have been identified and isolated.

* It avoids the problem of structural differences in purified proteins.
Proteins in their purified form may not interact with the protein complexed on
a virion.

* Selection using intact virus particles may lead to the identification of
viral components previously unknown.

"The success of isolating numerous anti-RSV RNAs and RNA analogs from a large
pool of random sequences immediately suggests the potential application of
this approach to isolate RNA and nuclease-resistant RNA analogs against other
viruses such as HIV," concluded Pan et al.

This research was supported by Pennsylvania State University Start-up funds;
National Institutes of Health grant CA47482; American Cancer Society grant
FRA427; and funds from the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.

Gene Discovery
Scientists One Step Closer To Understanding Cancer


In a paper published in the October 1995 issue of Nature Genetics, a team led
by University of Houston (UH), Texas, associate professor Dan Wells announced
that it had identified a gene associated with multiple exostoses (spurs or
bony outgrowths) and associated chondrosarcomas (malignant growths in the
cartilage), a form of bone cancer.

The gene, located on chromosome eight, causes a loss of control of bone
growth, and bone spurs begin to grow in unusual places.  Normally these bone
spurs are benign, but sometimes they turn malignant and spread rapidly through
the body, leading to death.  Currently there is no known treatment for this
type of bone cancer.

"This is the first step in the long journey to finding a cure for multiple
exostoses and chondrosarcomas," said Wells.  "Next we have to study the gene
and learn why it malfunctions and the exostoses start to grow.  Only then can
scientists begin to find a cure and ultimately a way to prevent the unwanted
growth from occurring."

Scientists already know that the defective gene is hereditary and that it is a
tumor suppressor gene, a type of gene that prevents tumor growth.  In this
case, it prevents the bones from over growing.

The speed with which the gene was discovered was aided by the Human Genome
Project.  Now in its sixth year, this is a 15-year study sponsored by the
National Science Foundation to map all 23 pairs of chromosomes.  Wells and his
team are working on chromosome eight.  In addition, the European Union and the
Japanese government are funding similar research.

The goal of the Human Genome Project is to determine the complete nucleotide
(the basic structural unit of RNA and DNA) sequence of human DNA.  This
sequence of four nucleotides (referred to as A, C, G and T) is the blueprint
for the human organism.  This blueprint will aid in understanding genetic
diseases and in developing treatments and cures.

Wells' research is being sponsored by the U.S.  National Institutes of Health
(NIH) and the IMB.  The IMB is an interdisciplinary organization of thirteen
UH faculty members from the Departments of Biochemical and Biophysical
Sciences, Biology, and Chemical Engineering that relies extensively on
molecular biology in individual research programs.

Genetics (Risk Assessment)
Graphs Enable Easy, Accurate Assessment of Breast Cancer Risk


A series of graphs can now provide genetic counselors an accurate, easy method
of predicting a woman's absolute risk of developing breast cancer.

The graphs are published in the December 1995 issue of the Journal of Clinical
Oncology, by University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, researcher John J.
Mulvihill, M.D., and Jacques Benichou, M.D., Ph.D., and Mitchell Gail, M.D.,
Ph.D., both of the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).

The graphs are based on data from the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration
Project, a large national study that monitored 280,000 women from 1973 to 1980
to determine risk factors associated with breast cancer.  The findings
resulted in what is called the Gail model, which predicts breast cancer risk
for Caucasian women being screened for breast cancer based on five factors -
age at onset of menstruation, age at first live birth, age at risk evaluation,
number of breast biopsies and number of first-degree relatives with breast
cancer.

"Although the Gail model has proven extremely important for research, it is
difficult to use without complex computer calculations.  We wanted to provide
genetic counselors a more convenient way to assist women in determining their
absolute risk of developing breast cancer," said Mulvihill, professor of human
genetics and co-director of the Pittsburgh Genetics Institute at the
University of Pittsburgh.  "With proper counseling, these graphs should be
invaluable in helping many concerned women understand their breast cancer
risk."

The graphs resulted from the multiplication of three variables that take into
account the Gail model risks, together with a term which depends on whether
any breast biopsy has or has not revealed atypical hyperplasia (a
pre-cancerous condition).  The graphs convert this calculated relative risk
into an absolute risk for a woman of a specific age over a given period of
time.

The graphs do not circumvent the need to collect important information from
women under evaluation and the need to rule out genetic traits that greatly
alter the risk of breast cancer, according to Mulvihill.  Such traits include
rare inherited syndromes that predispose families to cancer and mutations in
the BRCA1 (breast cancer 1) gene.

Mulvihill also cautioned that such graphs need to be used in an ongoing
process of breast cancer screening, counseling and education.

Human Papillomavirus (Diagnostics)
Serum Antibody to HPV-16 VLPs Indicates Cervical HPV-16 Infection


Serum antibody to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) virus-like particles
(VLPs) could be useful in epidemiology studies and for surveillance.

Louise Wideroff, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, and colleagues
evaluated an ELISA to detect serum IgG antibody response to HPV-16 VLPs
("Evaluation of Seroreactivity to Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Virus-like
Particles in an Incident Case-Control Study of Cervical Neoplasia," Journal of
Infectious Diseases, December 1995;172:1425-1430).  They used sera collected
from an incident case-control study of cervical neoplasia and compared
serologic results with established DNA markers of cervical HPV-16 infection.

Serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs is a relatively sensitive indicator of
persisting cervical HPV-16 infection, based on data from the study.

The study included 688 individuals with continued normal cytology (control
group) and 152 patients with confirmed incident squamous intraepithelial
lesions.  The patients were tested for DNA of a broad spectrum of HPV types at
the beginning of the study and at follow-up.

"Of controls, 16.6 percent were seropositive compared with 30.8 percent and
52.4 percent of cases with low- and high-grade lesions, respectively," wrote
Wideroff et al.  "Seropositivity increased from 22.2 percent in subjects who
were HPV-16 DNA positive by polymerase chain reaction once only (enrollment or
follow-up) to 83.3 percent in those who were HPV-16 DNA positive at both time
points."

Because the potential validity of any HPV serologic marker depends on how
valid an indicator it is of exposure to viral antigens, it is essential to pay
close attention to establishing the marker's validity before it is used as a
clinical or research tool, the authors noted.

HPV of differing genotypes encode a range of capsid and nonstructural proteins
that are immunogenic in the infected individual, and efforts to characterize
the host immune response to the antigens have targeted, in part, on
establishing in human sera the prevalence of anti-HPV antibodies.

Challenges associated with culturing HPV to obtain viral antigens by
traditional methods have lead to the development of alternative antigen
sources in order to perform host immune response studies.  Wideroff et al.
noted that such sources include recombinant bacterial fusion proteins,
synthetic peptides and virions produced in xenograft and raft systems.  Empty
capsids, referred to as VLPs, serve as another source of antigen.  VLPs
self-assemble in eukaryotic cells that are infected with HPV expression
vectors, such as baculovirus (Kirnbauer et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA,
1992;89:12180-12184; Rose et al., J Virol, 1993;67:1936-1944; Hagensee et al.,
J Virol, 1993;67:315-322; Kirnbauer et al., J Virol, 1993;67:6929-6936).

Previously reported research studies have demonstrated that self-assembled
HPV-16 L1 plus L2 VLPs, expressed in insect cells via baculovirus vectors, are
capable of detecting anti-HPV-16 IgG antibody in serum by ELISA (Kirnbauer et
al., J Natl Cancer Inst, 1994;86:494-499; Galloway, J Natl Cancer Inst,
1994;86:474-475).

"In epidemiologic applications, serum antibody to HPV-16 VLPs could be a
useful end point biomarker in studies to determine risk factors for HPV
transmission," wrote Wideroff et al.  "It could also be considered an exposure
biomarker to assess immunologic risk factors for HPV-associated disease or as
a surrogate for viral infection itself when biologic samples are unavailable
for DNA testing."

The HPV serologic marker also could be beneficial as a surveillance tool for
estimating the population prevalence of HPV-16 exposure and to inspect
geographic variation and time trends in HPV associated infection, they added.

The HPV-16 serologic assay has been patented by contributing authors J.
Schiller, R.  Kirnbauer and D.  Lowy.  Contributing authors A.  Lorincz and
M.M.  Manos serve as scientific director and consultant, respectively, for

Human Papillomavirus (Vaccine Design)
VLPs from One Variant May Help To Prevent Infection


The finding that two human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) variants are
serologically cross-reactive is encouraging news for the development of a
genital HPV vaccine.

Grace Cheng, U.S.  National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland and
colleagues from the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
Atlanta, Georgia, and the Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark, set out
to find whether DNA sequence variants of HPV-16 are distinct serotypes.

Cheng et al.  compared the reactivities of women's sera from Zaire (n=97) and
Denmark (n=123) ("Divergent Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Variants Are
Serologically Cross-Reactive," Journal of Infectious Diseases, December
1995;172:1584-1587).

For the comparison, they used IgG-specific ELISAs based on virus-like
particles (VLPs) composed of the L1 major capsid protein derived from an
HPV-16 variant commonly found in central Africa (Z-1194) or from a variant
that is common in northern Europe (114K).  Z-1194 was isolated in Zaire from a
woman with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and who also was positive for
HIV.

"We have found that among the 220 women whose sera were tested, almost all who
had a serologic response to one HPV-16 L1 variant also responded to the
other," wrote Cheng et al.  "Therefore we conclude that strains 114K and
Z-1194 are serologically cross-reactive and likely belong to the same
serotype.  This is the case despite a relatively large number of amino acid
differences in the major capsid proteins of the two strains."

The L1s differed in seven amino acids.  In only one serum sample did the
researchers see evidence for a specific reaction to only one, and not the
other VLP variant.

If data from future research studies, which apply other L1 variants and other
sets of sera, substantiate the current findings, this would have several
implications.

The first such implication would be that the lack of serotypic divergence
would suggest individual genital HPV types have not undergone the type of
antigenic drift (such as that seen in influenza viruses) that changes
seroreactivity to virons.

"This implies either that changes in the major seroreactive virion epitopes
cannot be tolerated or that neutralizing antibodies do not play a dominant
role in controlling genital HPV infection under natural conditions," wrote
Cheng et al.

The results also suggest that an ELISA which is based on a single VLP variant
could be applied for evaluating HPV-16 infection in different populations.

"Finally, these results are encouraging from the point of view of developing a
genital HPV vaccine, since they suggest that VLPs from a single HPV-16 variant
might be effective worldwide in preventing HPV-16 infection," Cheng et al.
wrote.

Many of the nucleotide sequence variants of HPV-16 that have been identified
have been isolated in separate geographic areas (Chan et al., J Virol,
1992;66:2057-2066 and 5714-5725; Ho et al., J Virol, 1993;67:6413-6423).

Reinhard Kirnbauer, a co-author of the current report, and colleagues have
performed numerous VLP-based ELISA studies to investigate HPV-16 infection
(Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1992;89:12180-12184; J Virol, 1993;67:6923-6936; J
Natl Cancer Inst, 1994;86:494-504).

Immunology
Discovery of Tumor Antigens Facilitated by Novel Process


Elusive tumor antigens can't hide from SEREX (serological identification of
antigens by recombinant expression cloning).

The success of recombinant tumor vaccines and other immunotherapeutic
modalities in cancer patients is dependent upon the immune systems recognition
of tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens.  In spite of extensive
efforts to identify tumor antigens in human neoplasms at the molecular level,
too few have actually been pinpointed.

Ugur Sahin et al.  modified the strategy of autologous typing to allow for an
unbiased search, in addition to the direct molecular definition of,
immunogenic tumor proteins based on their reaction with autologous patient
sera ("Human Neoplasms Elicit Multiple Specific Immune Responses in the
Autologous Host," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, December 5,
1995;92(25):11810-13).

"By applying this strategy of SEREX to four unselected human tumors of
different origin, we discovered an unexpected frequency of tumor antigens that
elicit specific immune responses in the autologous host," stated Sahin et al.
"Since the molecular definition of tumor antigens by SEREX of tumor cDNA is
fast and has a high yield, it may make sense to first define tumor antigens by
SEREX and then to analyze their role in T-cell immunity.  Such a strategy
could provide a rapidly expanding basis for additional approaches to the
immunotherapy and gene therapy of human neoplasms."

The cDNA libraries from diagnostic biopsies of four patients with malignant
melanoma, brain tumor, renal cancer, and Hodgkin disease, were expressed in E.
coli.  In order to test for clones expressing antigens against which the
autologous patient had specific antibodies, 1x10(6) recombinant clones from
each tumor cDNA were screened.  An ELISA modified for the exclusive detection
of human IgG antibodies was used.

Of the 5x10(6) clones tested, 109 were found to be reactive with IgG
antibodies in the serum sample of the autologous patient.  Cross-hybridization
experiments determined that the 109 positive clones contained 24 different
inserts.  From four patients, 24 different antigens were discovered, noted the
authors.

The autologous typing strategy that was modified by the authors was first
developed by L.J.  Old and reported in the 1981 issue of Cancer Research,
41:361-75.

In order to determine the occurrence of antibodies against these newly defined
tumor antigens, different tumor patients and healthy controls donated blood
for testing against these antigens.  Antibodies against the tumor antigens
were detected at varying rates only in patients with the same type of tumor.

The authors noted that the definition of 24 antigens in four tumors of
different origin suggests that the analysis of B-cell responses against other
tumors of the same or new types may identify an unexpected abundance of human
tumor antigens.  Their results suggested that tumor immunogenicity in the
autologous host is a common phenomenon and not restricted to malignant
melanomas.

In addition, the immunogenicity of human tumors seems not to be due to the
expression of a single antigen, but is conferred by multiple antigens.  Their
observation that antibodies against the new antigens could only be found in
the sera of patients bearing the same type of tumor suggested that tumor
growth is essential for the development of a humoral immune response against
the respective tumor antigens, and that antibody production is not an
autoimmune effect elicited by tumor-independent mechanisms.

The authors noted that their study was different from other studies which used
sera to detect antibodies.  Other studies have relied on low-titer serum
antibodies or human monoclonal antibodies generated in vitro from patients'
lymphocytes.  Theirs, on the other hand, uses a stringent serological
detection system which is limited to antigens that elicit high-titer IgG
responses in the patient in vivo.

"According to our data, overexpression of antigens in the tumor compared to
normal tissues seems to be the most common reason for immunogenicity,"
concluded Sahin et al.  "Our observation that tumor antigens defined by T-cell
responses such as MAGE-1 and tyrosinase can also be detected by the
serological approach suggest that an integrated immune response against tumor
antigens may exist that involves both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells as well as B
cells."

Industry News (Joint Venture)
Agreement Signed To Develop Anti-Cancer Therapeutics


Mitotix Incorporated, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and DuPont Merck, Wilmington,
Delaware, announced a collaborative agreement to develop and commercialize
novel anti-cancer therapeutics that act on a group of enzymes called
cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), that are essential for regulating the cell
division cycle.

Through the agreement, DuPont Merck could invest up to $55 million in Mitotix
in the form of equity, research, development and clinical milestone payments.

The collaboration is initially focusing on three of Mitotix's proprietary
molecular targets.  Under the terms of the agreement, DuPont Merck receives
exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Cdk-based therapeutics
and radiopharmaceutical diagnostics.

Mitotix retains worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain Cdk
targets for non-cancer indications, as well as all rights to develop and
commercialize gene therapy and antisense approaches utilizing the Cdk targets.
Mitotix also retains rights to certain diagnostic applications and has an
option to co-promote in the U.S.  any therapeutic products that arise from the
collaboration with DuPont Merck.

The agreement provides Mitotix with an up-front equity investment and Cdk
research funding over four years totaling $17 million.  The agreement involves
up to an additional $38 million in Cdk research funding extensions and product
development related milestone payments to Mitotix, as drugs are successfully
developed and approved.  Mitotix will also receive royalties on net worldwide
sales of all Cdk products.  DuPont Merck will fund all preclinical research
and development activities.  In connection with the agreement, Mitotix's
current venture investors will make an additional $3 million equity investment
in the company.

The cyclin targets covered in the collaboration represent all regulatory
molecules that drive the critical cell cycle transitions from growth through
DNA replication.  The collaboration initially seeks to develop therapeutic
products for the treatment of cancer through inhibition of these essential Cdk
molecules.  Specifically, Mitotix and DuPont Merck will work to identify
inhibitors of cyclin D1 and cyclin E, and mimetics of the tumor suppressor
gene, p16, to control the inappropriate cell division that is the hallmark of
cancer.

"A key focus of the research program with DuPont Merck is on the molecular
pathway that includes Cyclin D1 and p16," said Dr.  David Beach, a Howard
Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and a
scientific co-founder of Mitotix.  "In most cancers one or more of the
components of this pathway, which controls the cell's entry into the process
of DNA replication, are deregulated."

Cyclin D1 and p16 act as molecular "on" and "off" switches in driving the
process of DNA replication.  Research has shown that cyclin D1 is expressed at
high levels in a variety of tumors, including breast, colon, esophageal
cancers, and lymphomas.  Additionally, a large body of recent research has
demonstrated that in 20 to 50 percent of tumors, including breast, bladder,
esophageal and skin cancers, the natural cell cycle inhibitor p16 is missing
or mutated, thus allowing uncontrolled cell growth.

Cyclin E acts at a similar regulatory point in the cell cycle to cyclin D1,
but through a distinct biochemical pathway.  Recently published research has
shown that elevated levels of cyclin E appear to increase the rate at which
cells divide.  Mitotix holds exclusive worldwide rights to cyclin D1 and p16
from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, based on discoveries made by Beach.
Mitotix also has exclusive worldwide rights to cyclin D1 patent applications
from the Massachusetts General Hospital, and exclusive therapeutic rights to
an issued U.S.  patent covering cyclin E from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center.

Separately, the partners have agreed to conduct initial research to assess the
development of anti-cancer therapeutics that act by inhibiting
ubiquitin-mediated degradation.  The specific terms of this separate research
effort were not disclosed.  The collaboration, which builds on previous work
by Mitotix scientists, is designed to inhibit the ubiquitin-mediated
degradation of p53, thereby increasing levels of the protein and driving tumor
cells into apoptosis (programmed cell death).  The p53 protein normally acts
as a tumor suppressor gene that functions to halt the cell division cycle to
allow for DNA repair.

Anticancer Drug Licensing/Research Agreement Signed


Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, New Jersey, and EntreMed, Inc.,
Rockville, Maryland, announced an agreement in which Bristol-Myers Squibb will
obtain exclusive worldwide licensing rights to antiangiogenic compounds now in
development by EntreMed, Inc.

Antiangiogenic therapies, which have been shown in preclinical studies to
prevent the abnormal formation of blood vessels, have the potential to block
the growth of primary and metastatic cancers by eliminating a tumor's blood
supply.

Under the terms of the agreement, Bristol-Myers Squibb has made an equity
investment in EntreMed and will fund a five-year research collaboration in the
area of angiogenesis and its application in the treatment of cancer.  In
return, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain worldwide licensing rights to the
recently discovered antiangiogenic applications of the drugs thalidomide,
thalidomide analogs and Angiostatin protein, which have generated considerable
interest in the medical community.

Angiostatin is a novel protein which may suppress malignant tumor formation by
inhibiting the growth of blood vessels.  In preclinical trials, it has
successfully caused the regression of primary human breast, prostate, and
colon tumors in animal models.

Thalidomide, developed as a sedative, has not been approved in the U.S., and
it was originally associated with birth defects.  However, if it is shown to
be an effective antiangiogenic therapy in humans, it has the potential to
become a significant anticancer agent.  There are currently no antiangiogenic
products approved for the treatment of cancer.

Angiogenesis research was pioneered by Judah Folkman, M.D., director of the
Surgical Research Laboratory at Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts,
and professor of pediatric surgery at Harvard Medical School.  Folkman was the
first to observe that cancerous tissues are fed by newly-grown blood vessels
sprouting from existing arteries.

He theorized that if doctors could prevent these blood vessels from growing,
then the tumor would starve.  Since Children's Hospital has a sponsored
research agreement with EntreMed, Bristol-Myers Squibb will obtain first
refusal rights on any antiangiogenic technologies developed in Folkman's
laboratory and licensed by EntreMed.

It is expected that the first clinical trials to test the antiangiogenic
properties of these compounds in cancer will begin in 1996.  EntreMed has
already initiated clinical trials with thalidomide in the treatment of
blindness due to age-related macular degeneration, another angiogenic
disorder.

DaunoXome Shows Promise as Treatment


Moderate-dose DaunoXome, a liposomal formulation of the anticancer agent
daunorubicin, is well-tolerated and has promising efficacy in treating
advanced breast cancer.

The data was presented by NeXstar Pharmaceuticals', Boulder, Colorado, at the
18th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, held December 10-13, 1995 in
San Antonio, Texas.

Moreover, the limited toxicity observed in this trial, particularly the
absence of cardiotoxicity, suggests that DaunoXome may be useful in
ameliorating the side-effects that now accompany high-dose anthracycline-based
chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.  The data, generated in a Phase II
study funded by NeXstar, were presented by P.S.  Hupperets, M.D., of the
Akademisch Ziekenhuis, in Maastricht, the Netherlands.

Eleven women with previously untreated, newly diagnosed metastatic breast
cancer received DaunoXome at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) every three weeks for as
long as 24 weeks.  Even at this moderate dose, three patients (27 percent)
developed a partial response, seven (63 percent) had stable disease, and one
patient (10 percent) experienced no therapeutic benefit.

Toxicity was minimal:  no patients lost hair, and only two patients reported
mild nausea.  Six patients showed evidence of bone marrow suppression, which
did not limit treatment and which recovered without supporting therapy.  No
patients demonstrated signs of cardiotoxicity.

"These data demonstrate that moderate-dose DaunoXome therapy produces the same
kind of response rates as conventional single-agent doxorubicin therapy, but
with a much improved side-effects profile," said Michael E.  Ross, NeXstar's
vice president for medical and regulatory affairs.

"We believe that these results bode well not only for the expanded trials
we're conducting in breast cancer, but for the other solid tumor indications
in which DaunoXome is being tested.  We also believe that the absence of
cardiotoxicity suggests that DaunoXome may play an important role in replacing
conventional anthracyclines in high-dose, multiple-agent chemotherapy
regimens."  Such studies are currently in progress.

DaunoXome has already been approved in the United Kingdom (U.K.)  and Sweden
as a primary therapy for the treatment of advanced Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in
HIV positive patients, and is awaiting final approval in the United States for
the same indication.

In addition to the Phase II study in breast cancer, the company is conducting
Phase II trials with DaunoXome in small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung
cancer, hepatocellular cancer, adult and childhood leukemia, brain tumor,
bladder cancer and lymphoma.

Ethyol Approved for Marketing by FDA To Treat Ovarian Cancer


U.S.  Bioscience, Inc., West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, announced that Ethyol
(amifostine, WR-2721), a selective cytoprotective agent, was cleared for
marketing by the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Ethyol is indicated to reduce the cumulative renal (kidney) toxicity
associated with repeated administration of cisplatin in patients with advanced
ovarian cancer.  Ethyol represents a class of selective systemic
cytoprotective agents which, when administered prior to treatment, can protect
healthy cells from the damaging effects of chemotherapy.

Ethyol is expected to be available to physicians and patients in early 1996.
U.S.  Bioscience is currently in the advanced stage of negotiation with a
potential marketing partner.

U.S.  Bioscience had previously secured a recommendation for marketing
approval for Ethyol by the European Committee for Propriety Medicinal Products
(CPMP) for reduction of neutropenia related risk of infection (e.g.
neutropenic fever) from cyclophosphamide and cisplatin in patients with
advanced ovarian cancer.

U.S.  Bioscience recently submitted a dossier to the CPMP requesting an
expansion of the CPMP indication for Ethyol to include protection against
renal toxicity resulting from repeated courses of cisplatin.  Ethyol has
recently been launched by Schering-Plough in a number of major European
markets.  Ethyol is currently under review in Canada where Eli Lilly will
market the product under an alliance reached with U.S.  Bioscience earlier in
1995.

Ethyol has a unique history representing an unanticipated benefit of the Cold
War era.  It originated in a previously classified United States Army nuclear
warfare research project, where the drug, known as WT-2721, was selected as
the best of over 4,000 chemicals tested for development as a compound which
might protect soldiers from radiation exposure.  Once the project became
declassified, oncologists began exploring the potential role of Ethyol in
medicine as a means of selectively reducing the serious toxicities associated
with radiation therapy used to treat cancer patients, as well as chemotherapy.

U.S.  Bioscience will continue to investigate Ethyol in other cancers
utilizing different chemotherapeutic combinations as well as radiation
therapy.

Survival Improvement Shown in Breast Cancer Trial with Theratope


Dr.  Grant MacLean, Medical Oncologist and principal investigator for
Biomira's clinical study at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada, presented results of Biomira's Phase II clinical trials of Theratope
therapeutic vaccine, in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

The meeting "Novel Vaccine Strategies:  Immunotherapeutic Strategies for
Cancer" Conference was held in San Diego, California.  Theratope is a
non-toxic therapy designed to stimulate the immune system of cancer patients
to respond against the cancer.  The study was conducted over a 2-1/2 year
period at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton and Guy's Hospital in London,
United Kingdom (U.K.).

Among 48 women in a randomized clinical trial, MacLean reported that 24 who
received Theratope in its standard investigational program had a statistically
significant increase in survival over 24 women in the other study group who
did not receive the standard immunomodulation prior to Theratope treatment.
The women on the standard Theratope program have a projected median survival
of 19.7 months versus 12.6 months for the other study group, with statistical
significant at P=0.018.

In addition to increased survival, the women on the standard Theratope program
had statistically significant higher levels of antibodies against a specific
molecule, Sialyl-Tn (STn), found on the surface of breast cancer cells, than
was observed with those who received the alternate Theratope program.

Since receiving the analysis of the data, Biomira has been consulting with
clinical investigators and scientists about these results and will be
contacting regulatory officials in the U.S., Canada and Europe to discuss
their recommendations for the next steps to take Theratope therapeutic vaccine
to commercialization for women who suffer from metastatic breast cancer.

Preventive Medicine
Organization Criticizes Task Force Recommendations


The American College of Radiology (ACR) strongly disagrees with statements
made by the U.S.  Preventive Services Task Force regarding mammography
screening and screening and treatment for prostate cancer.

The college is particularly concerned about suggestions that breast cancer
screening is not warranted for women under the age of 50 and over the age of
70.  The ACR also believes that colorectal screening should include all
appropriate strategies, including the double contrast barium enema.  In
addition, the College contests the Task Force's suggestion that prostate
cancer patients over the age of 70 should not be treated for their disease.

The American College of Radiology reaffirms its support for mammography
screening beginning by the age of 40.  Mammography screening provides for
early detection, and early detection increases a woman's chance for survival.
When a woman has her breast cancer detected early she has more treatment
options.

Beginning by the age of 40 a woman should have an annual clinical breast
examination and a mammogram every one to two years.  Beginning at age 50, she
should have an annual clinical breast examination and a mammogram every year.

The Task Force says that there is no strong evidence for or against
mammography screening in the younger age group.  On the contrary, evidence out
of Kopparberg, Sweden, British Columbia, Edinburgh and in the 14-year
follow-up of the Breast Cancer Demonstration Project in the United States
strongly suggest a benefit.  In addition, preliminary reports out of
Gothenburg, Sweden show a strong survival benefit for screening younger women.

Mammography screening should not be discontinued in women 70 and older, as
suggested by the Task Force.  More than one-third of breast cancer cases are
in this age group.  Further, the fastest growing segment of the population are
those who are 100 years and older.  Most are in good health.  Women in all age
groups have the right to have their breast cancer detected early and treated
properly.

The U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI) recently reported a decline in the
number of breast cancer deaths, which has been attributed, at least in part,
to the increase in the number of women who are undergoing regular screening.
There was an 8.1 percent decrease in deaths in Caucasian women ages 40-49 and
a 3.4 percent decrease in deaths in women 70-79.

Research indicates that the double contrast barium enema, long an accepted
method for imaging high risk patients for colorectal cancer, is also a viable
screening examination for low-risk patients.  The Office of Technology
Assessment (OTA) recently found the double contrast barium enema and flexible
sigmoidoscopy to be the most cost-effective colorectal cancer strategies.

Prostate cancer survival rates are 94 percent if the disease is caught early.
While no screening test is perfect, the digital rectal examination and the
prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test have proven to be effective in
diagnosing the disease.  The American Cancer Society recommends that every man
40 and older should have a digital rectal examination each year.  Beginning at
age 50, men should have an annual PSA blood test.  The American College of
Radiology endorses these guidelines, noting that studies which show no
advantage to screening are out-of-date and controversial in their
interpretation.

The Task Force again targets the older American in its suggestion that the
risks outweigh the benefits of treatment for prostate cancer.  The risks of
radiation therapy are minimal.  A patient and his doctor need to determine
what, if any treatment is appropriate.

Every patient has a right to know, as soon as possible, if he or she has
cancer.  Each cancer patient has a right to discuss their treatment options
with their physician and make a personal decision as to the appropriate
treatment.  These rights should not be overshadowed by any recommendations or
suggestions of the Task Force.

Transplantation (BMT)
HLA-Matched Unrelated Donors Are Good Option for CML Patients


Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from HLA-matched volunteer unrelated donors
(VUDs) can cure a significant number of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML).

For patients with CML, allogeneic BMT is established as an effective means to
restore normal hematopoiesis.  However, the lack of a suitable HLA-identical
sibling has led to more frequent use of VUDs.  Compared with HLA-identical
sibling donor BMT, VUD BMT has been associated with greater morbidity and
mortality, especially because of greater rates of graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) and graft failure.

Andrew Spencer, Leukemia Research Fund Center for Adult Leukemia, Royal
Postgraduate Medical School, London, England, and colleagues performed an
analysis of the outcome of VUD BMT in 115 patients with CML at their
institution ("Bone Marrow Transplantation for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia with
Volunteer Unrelated Donors Using Ex Vivo or In Vivo T-Cell Depletion:  Major
Prognostic Impact of HLA Class I Identity between Donor and Recipient," Blood,
1995;86(9):3590-3597).

Their aim was to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from VUD
BMT.

"We have demonstrated that VUD BMT can cure a significant number of
appropriately selected patients with CML," wrote Spencer et al.  They added
that the availability of high-resolution tissue typing techniques enables more
accurate predictions of outcome after VUD BMT.  The use of such methods should
allow the more appropriate use of VUD BMT in managing CML.

"In young, chronic phase patients lacking an HLA-matched sibling, a search for
an unrelated donor should be commenced immediately," wrote Spencer et al.  "If
a potential donor, matched using high-resolution typing techniques, is
identified, BMT should be considered as soon as possible."

Spencer et al.  performed 115 VUD BMT for first chronic phase or advanced
phase CML between August 1985 and July 1994.  They supplemented standard
serologic HLA typing of recipients and potential donors with one-dimensional
isoelectric focusing (IEF) for class I proteins, allogenotyping for DR and DQ
alleles using DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and
the measurement of antirecipient major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor cells in the donors' blood (CTLp assay).

The overall leukemia-free survival (LFS) at three years was 37 percent.  The
probabilities of survival and LFS for patients under the age of 40 years who
were transplanted in the first chronic phase from an IEF-matched donor were 73
percent and 50 percent, respectively.

"We conclude that VUD BMT is a reasonable option for patients with CML; when
using ex vivo or in vivo T-cell depletion, optimal results are achieved in
patients transplanted in chronic phase with marrow from donors without
demonstrable class I HLA mismatch and a low CTLp frequency," wrote Spencer et
al.

The current study showed an association between graft failure and increasing
donor age that has not been recognized before.  The graft failure rate of 16
percent reported by Spender et al.  corresponds to that reported by other
researchers (McGlave et al., Blood, 1990;75:1728; McGlave et al., Blood,
1993;81:543).

Researchers have indicated that about two-thirds of patients, otherwise
eligible for BMT, lack a matched sibling donor (Beatty et al.,
Transplantation, 1988;45:714).

The corresponding author for this study is Andrew Spencer, LRF Centre for
Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Du Cane Road, London W12
ONN, United Kingdom.

Transplantation (Cord Blood)
Improved Methods Address Storage and Cell Viability Challenges


Recent processing improvements should make frozen placental/umbilical cord
blood (PCB) a more useful source of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow
reconstitution.

Pablo Rubinstein and colleagues, Lindsley F.  Kimball Research Institute of
the New York Blood Center, New York, New York, addressed two key requirements
for moving unrelated-donor PCB transplantation forward as a practical
alternative for clinical use ("Processing and Cryopreservation of
Placental/Umbilical Cord Blood for Unrelated Bone Marrow Reconstitution,"
Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci.  USA, 1995;92(22):10119-10122).

First, they developed a method that maximizes freezer storage space by
concentrating the hematopoietic cells of PCB units into units of smaller
volume.  Second, they developed a method to overcome loss of viability
associated with cryopreservation and thawing.

In the unrelated donor/recipient setting, human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)-matched donors must be obtained for candidate patients.  This requires
the establishment of large panels of frozen HLA-typed PCB units, noted
Rubinstein et al.  This effort typically involves a large volume of
unprocessed PCB units consisting primarily of red blood cells, plasma and
cryopreservation medium, which take up limited, expensive frozen storage space
in liquid nitrogen.

Rubinstein et al.  designed a closed-system procedure, compatible with routine
blood bank processing, that concentrates almost all the leukocytes and
progenitor cells in PCB units.  The procedure is based on a hydroxyethyl
starch (HES)-induced rouleaux formation and mild centrifugation to separate a
leukocyte-rich supernatant from sedimented red blood cells.

"Since the probability of finding an HLA-matched unit depends on the number of
units available and since the number of units that can be stored in a given
space is determined by the average unit volume, smaller PCB units are
essential for PCB to become a practical source of tissue for unrelated
transplantation," wrote Rubinstein et al.

Decreasing the volume of PCB units by removing the bulk of red blood cells and
plasma offers practical advantages such as convenience, cost and efficiency,
compared with current options.

The second issue - reduced cell viability after the cryopreserved PCB units
are thawed - was diminished by adding one volume of isotonic diluent to the
cell suspension in 10 percent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Dilution of the freshly thawed cryopreserved unit with an equal volume of
isotonic solution allows the product to be thawed and prepared for infusion
under controlled laboratory conditions instead of at the patient's bedside,
noted the researchers.

"Removal of the cryoprotective medium can be performed there [the laboratory
setting], without harm to the units:  clonogenic activity and viability remain
essentially unchanged, even if removal of diluted DMSO is delayed for several
hours," wrote Rubinstein et al.

Removing DMSO eliminates its unfavorable side effects on the recipient
(Stroncek et al., Transfusion, 1991;31:521-526; Davis et al., Blood,
1990;75:781-786).

"These improvements make frozen PCB a more effective source of stem cells for
unrelated marrow reconstitution in the treatment of inherited disease and
hematologic malignancy and, potentially, for recombinant DNA-based gene
therapy," wrote Rubinstein et al.

The same procedure to minimize loss of viability might be used in the
cryopreservation process for bone marrow and peripheral blood stem and
progenitor cells.  It also may be possible to remove malignant cells or to
introduce chemical or genetic labels into cells before infusion.

Numerous advantages in using PCB as donor tissue for unrelated bone marrow
restoration have been reported, including timely availability of PCB to
patients and lower frequency of certain infections, as described in an earlier
published review (Rubinstein et al., Blood, 1993;7:1679-1690).

Another significant advantage of PCB grafts is their remarkably lower
incidence of associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major cause of
morbidity and mortality in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients (Sullivan,
in Bone Marrow Transplantation, eds.  Forman, Blume & Thomas, 1994, Blackwell,
Boston, pp.  339-362).

In February 1993 the New York Blood Center's Placental Blood Project started
collecting PCB units to study the clinical usefulness of this source of stem
cells (Rubinstein, Blood Cells, 1994;20:587-600).  Of the 24 patients who
received PCB grafts before February 26, 1995, 12 still were alive and doing
well as of March 30, 1995.  None of the recipients developed clinically severe
GVHD within follow-up periods of 2 to 18 months.

Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, and by grants

"Suppression of Human U87 Glioblastoma Tumor Growth in the Flank of Nude Mice
with Antisense Oligonucleotides to the c-myb Oncogene."  V.C.  Low, C.  You,

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "c-myb is a proto-oncogene which encodes a nuclear protein
involved in the regulation of the cell cycle.  This oncogene is typically over
expressed in various types of cancer.  Previous studies in our laboratories
demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides to the c-myb oncogene can
suppress the proliferation of human medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cells
grown in vitro.  In the present study, we have examined the effects of
antisense administration in vivo using nude mice as tumor transplant
recipients.  Human glioblastoma of the U87 cell line were injected into the
flank of nude mice (5x10(6) cells).  Ten days after the injection of the tumor
cells, animals received injections of either c-myb antisense or nonsense (100
(micro)M), or Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) in 50 (micro)l volumes
directly into the tumor.  Antisense oligos were designed for codons 182-188 of
the c-myb oncogene.  Antisense injections were given at days 10, 12, 14, and
16 after the transplantation of the tumor cells.  Tumor volume (mm(3)) was
measured daily for each animal over a period of 17 days.  Animals given
injections of HBSS exhibited tumors at day 17 which significantly increased in
size to 217% (P<0.05) of the volume prior to HBSS administration.  Animals
given nonsense oligonucleotides also exhibited tumors which significantly
increased in size by 210% (P<0.05).  In contrast, animals receiving c-myb
antisense exhibited no significant increase in tumor size with tumors only
128% of their pre-antisense treatment size.  These results suggest that the
administration of antisense to codons 182-188 of the c-myb oncogene can
suppress U87 tumor growth in vivo, and may thus be an effective form of
therapy in treating human brain tumors.  (Supported by a grant from the
American Cancer Society)."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "We have developed an ex vivo gene therapy paradigm for the
treatment of brain tumors using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF).  The murine B16 melanoma and the GL 261 glioma lines were
infected with MFG recombinant retrovirus containing the mouse GM-CSF cDNA.
The tumor lines were confirmed to secrete GM-CSF by ELISA.  Subcutaneous
vaccination of syngeneic mice with irradiated GM-CSF-secreting B16 melanoma
cells completely protected animals from subsequent intracranial B16 tumor
inoculation.  Histologic evaluation revealed the presence of neutrophils,
eosinophils and lymphocytes in the intracerebral inoculation site.  In
contrast, animals vaccinated with irradiated B16 cells or not vaccinated
succumbed to intracranial tumor within 3 weeks after inoculation.  Treatment
of established intracranial B16 melanoma tumors with subcutaneous injection of
irradiated GMCSF secreting B16 cells increased median survival as compared to
injection of irradiated B16 cells or no treatment.  In addition, treatment of
intracerebral glioma with subcutaneous vaccination with irradiated,
GM-CSF-secreting autologous cells also increased survival compared to
controls.  Histologic examination revealed a dramatic perivascular lymphocytic
infiltrate beginning 3 days after treatment with GM-CSF transduced cells which
was not found in controls."

"Differentiation Between Tuberculosis and Malignant Lymphoma in Abdominal
Lymph Nodes with Contrast-Enhanced CT."  Z.G.  Yang, P.Q.  Min, Z.Y.  He and
X.P.  Choc.  Chengdu, China.


According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  Tuberculosis of abdominal
lymph nodes is in some countries and can be easily misdiagnosed as malignant
lymphoma.  This study evaluates specific imaging criteria for differentiating
tuberculosis from malignant lymphoma in abdominal lymph nodes on contrast
enhanced CT.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The enhanced CT features of 125 sites in
50 patients, including tuberculosis (20 patients) and malignant lymphoma (30
patients) in abdominal lymph nodes, were retrospectively evaluated in a blind
review for the enhancement criteria of morphology, density, and location.
RESULTS:  Approximately 94% of sites of tuberculosis showed a ringlike
enhancement of enlarged lymph nodes, as compared with 4% of the sites of
malignant lymphoma (P<.01).  Approximately 55% of the patients with
tuberculosis had a mass of multilocular appearance compared with 4% of the
patients with malignant lymphoma (P<.01).  Tuberculosis frequently involved
the mesenteric, omental, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, while malignant
lymphoma frequently involved the retroperitoneal space.  But, the
retroperitoneal lymph nodes under L-2 were involved with tuberculosis in only
8% of the patients, whereas malignant lymphoma involved about 20% (P<.01).
Combining all criteria, reviewers diagnosed tuberculosis correctly in 94%,
with 93% specificity and 95% sensitivity.  CONCLUSION:  The differentiation of
tuberculosis from malignant lymphoma can be made with contrast-enhanced CT on
the basis of characteristic enhancement and sites of involved
lymphadenopathy."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  To illustrate the
difficulty in establishing the diagnosis of esophageal lymphoma in patients
with AIDS and concomitant viral infection.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Esophageal
lymphoma or possible esophageal lymphoma was diagnosed in 8 AIDS patients over
a 4-year period.  Six patients underwent esophagography, in addition to
endoscopy and biopsy.  Four patients underwent repeated biopsies.  No patients
underwent immunologic marker studies.  RESULTS:  Only 1 patient had a polypoid
mass in the distal esophagus typical of neoplasm.  The other 7 patients had
esophageal ulcers that radiologically and at gross inspection endoscopically
were considered of viral (cytomegalovirus [CMV] or idiopathic) origin.
Pathologic examination initially suggested lymphoma in all 7 patients with
concomitant CMV in 5.  Follow-up biopsies revealed that the 'lymphomatous'
infiltrate was actually inflammatory reaction in 3.  In 1 patient, an isolated
CMV inclusion was discovered on the 2nd biopsy, and the esophageal ulcer
resolved with ganciclovir despite continued pathologic evidence of lymphoma.
CONCLUSION:  Esophageal lymphoma and viral infection coexist such that there
can be considerable diagnostic and thereby therapeutic confusion in regard to
these patients.  In patients with radiologically benign viral ulcers, repeat
biopsy or marker studies of pathologically 'lymphomatous' lesions are in
order."

different mechanisms of spinal involvement by lymphoma.  Various kinds of
involvement are shown, including intramedullary lymphoma, lymphomatous
arachnoiditis, epidural lymphoma, and retroperitoneal lymphoma invading
epidural space.  Intramedullary AIDS related primary lymphoma is very unusual,
but primary or secondary lymphoma can occur in both intradural and epidural
spaces.  Diagnosis is made by means of lumbar puncture or biopsy.  For
intramedullary lymphoma in which biopsy is potentially dangerous, an empiric
antitoxoplasmic treatment should be undertaken if cerebrospinal fluid study
does not show lymphomatous cells.  If there is no improvement in the clinical
status and no decrease in the volume of the lesion, biopsy must be considered.
Radiation therapy can cure the lesion."

Gene Delivery (Brain Cancer)
"Extended Transfer of HSV-TK Gene into Disseminated 9L Brain Tumors by

N.G.  Rainov, M.  Chase, M.  Sena-Esteves, E.A.  Chiocca and X.O.

Breakefield.  Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital,
Boston, Massachusetts.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "The aim of the present study was to improve delivery of
therapeutic herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene into
disseminated brain tumor masses by intraarterial and intraventricular
injection of vectors.  The herpes vector hrR3 was used because highest gene
transfer efficiency was achieved after intratumoral application in our
laboratory with this vector, as compared to retrovirus or adenovirus vectors.
hrR3 bears the HSV-TK and the E.  coli lacZ reporter gene and has a deletion
in the ribonucleotide reductase gene, which allows selective virus replication
in dividing cells.  Two different models of disseminated 9L brain tumors were
established 5-7 days before intraarterial or intraventricular injections of
hrR3.  For intraarterial application bradykinin was injected prior to the
vector to disrupt selectively the blood-tumor-barrier.  Transfer efficiency of
the HSV-TK and lacZ genes was investigated in multiple tumor foci throughout
both hemispheres.  Intraventricular delivery of hrR3 was achieved via
stereotactical injections into the cisterna magna, and distribution of the
HSV-TK and lacZ genes was evaluated in a model with a right frontal lobe tumor
and extensive leptomeningeal tumor spread throughout the CSF pathways.  HSV-TK
and lacZ gene delivery was assessed in tumor masses and in normal brain at
different time points by immunohistochemical and histochemical detection of
the gene products.  With intraarterial application of hrR3 following selective
disruption of the blood-tumor barrier by bradykinin, transfer of the HSV-TK
and lacZ genes was found almost exclusively in the periphery of all
disseminated tumor foci.  Normal brain was not affected, and no toxicity was
observed.  Intraventricular delivery of the vector resulted in expression of
the HSV-TK and lacZ genes in the intracerebral and the leptomeningeal tumor
masses.  Some toxicity was observed with intensive leptomeningeal inflammation
and temporary infection of periventricular areas of the brain.  Intratumoral
HSV-TK and lacZ expression was strongest within the first 2 days after
intraarterial or intrathecal herpes injection, but was still detectable up to
at least 16 days after virus application, consistent with vector replication
in the tumors.  Both application strategies provide a marked extension of TK
gene transfer efficiency, as compared to intratumoral delivery.  Study

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "Immunity to tumors develops following ganciclovir (GCV) treatment
of brain tumors expressing the Herpes Simplex Virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK)
gene.  To study if HSV-TK by itself might contribute to the anti-tumor
immunogenicity, the growth of non-immunogenic D74 tumors, wild type (D74-w.t.)
and TK-modified D74 (D74-TK) brain tumor cells, were studied in naive rats and
rats previously treated and cured of 9L, tumors by HSV-TK and GCV treatments.
Formation of the D74-TK tumors were significantly reduced in both naive and
pretreated rats, even though the in vitro growth rate of these tumors was
similar.  Analysis of immune cells infiltrating the tumors revealed a
significant increase in the CD4 positive cells in TK-modified tumor cells in
the previously treated rats.  Furthermore the regression of the D74-TK tumors
was greater in the previously treated rats.  These findings suggest that even
in non immunogenic tumors, the expression of HSV-TK slows the tumor formation,
that can be associated with the immune response.  This immunity could be
exploited by vaccination strategies to increase tumor regression seen with
HSV-TK and GCV treatments.  Supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

examined the effect of BCR/ABL junctional antisense phosphodiester
oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) on BV173 and other chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) cell lines.  Various control ODNs were used to understand the mechanism
of the observed antiproliferative effect.  Not only the antisense ODNs but
also several control ODNs inhibit the proliferation of the leukemic cell
lines.  All the ODNs that inhibit the cell proliferation share a TAT consensus
sequence at their 3' end, A 1-base mismatch within this consensus sequence
abolishes the antiproliferative effect.  Mismatches of several bases at any
other position within the sequence of the active ODNs do not suppress the
observed effect.  Similar experiments on normal or CML CD34(+) cell fraction
led to the same observations.  We conclude that the antiproliferative effect
of the phosphodiester BCR/ABL antisense ODNs cannot be attributed to an
antisense mechanism but rather to a nonelucidated effect of a 3' terminal TAT
sequence.  This effect is not CML specific."  The corresponding author for

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Cancer Research,
"Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma have an elevated
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level.  This high level of AFP expression is
transcriptionally controlled by the 5'-flanking sequence of the AFP gene.
Using the 5'-flanking sequence as a promoter for the herpes simplex virus
thymidine kinase (RSV-TK) gene in an adenoviral vector (Av1AFPTK1), the
therapeutic efficacy of adenovirus-mediated HSV-TK gene transduction, followed
by ganciclovir (GCV) administration, was studied in tumors in athymic nude
mice.  Av1AFPTK1 transduction of two cell lines demonstrated HSV-TK enzyme
activity only in the AFP-producing cells (HuH7) and not in the AFP
nonproducing cells (SR-Hep-l).  As expected, only transduced HuH7 cells were
killed by GCV treatment.  Transduction by an adenoviral vector harboring a
Rous sarcoma virus promoter and HSV-TK gene (Av1TK1) showed enzymatic activity
and GCV killing in both cell lines.  All HuH7 tumors that were transduced with
either Av1AFPTK1 or Av1TK1 completely regressed after GCV treatment.  On the
other hand, there was complete regression of SK-Hep-l tumors only when treated
with Av1TK1 and GCV and not when treated with Av1AFPTK1 and GCV.  Thus,
cell-specific killing was achieved by adenoviral vector containing AFP
promoter for the HSV-TR gene and GCV treatment."  The corresponding author for

Ad5CMV-p21).  Elevated levels of endogenous mouse p21 mRNA provided evidence
for the functional activity of virally transduced p53.  Functional activity of
viral-transduced p21 was demonstrated through immunoprecipitation of cellular
protein extracts, which showed that the viral-transduced p21 associates with
cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and was sufficient to down-regulate the activity of
the cyclin-dependent kinase by approximately 65%.  In vitro growth assays
revealed significantly higher growth suppression after Ad5CMV-p21 infection
compared to Ad5CMV-p53.  In vivo studies in syngeneic male mice with
established s.c.  prostate tumors demonstrated that the rate of growth and
final tumor volume were reduced to a much greater extent in mice that received
intratumor injection of Ad5CMV-p21 compared to Ad5CMV-p53.  In addition, the
survival of host animals bearing tumors that were infected with Ad5CMV-p21,
but not Ad5CMV-p53, was significantly extended.  These data suggest that
Ad5CMV-p21 may be effective as a therapeutic agent for prostate cancer."  The

Cancer Vaccines
Duda, R.B.; Yang, H.; Dooley, D.D.; Abujawdeh, G.  "Recombinant BCG Therapy
Suppresses Melanoma Tumor Growth."  Annals of Surgical Oncology, November
1995;2(6):542-549.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Annals of
Surgical Oncology, "BACKGROUND:  Melanoma is the fastest rising cancer in the
United States.  Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been genetically engineered
to actively express and secrete the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2).  Both BCG
and IL-2 have known potent antitumor and immunomodulatory properties.
METHODS:  This recombinant BCG (rBCG 3A) has been tested as an intratumoral
injection and a vaccine therapy in conjunction with irradiated tumor cells
against melanoma in the murine B16 melanoma model.  RESULTS:  The transfection
process did not adversely alter the function of the wild-type (WT) BCG.  rBCG
3A and WT BCG are equally effective intratumoral and vaccine therapies against
melanoma when compared with normal saline control groups.  Tumor burdens were
significantly smaller (P less than or equal to 0.01 and 0.05) for the
treatment groups for both intratumoral and vaccine administration of therapy.
Immunization with rBCG 3A and WT BCG 14 days before a B16 challenge resulted
in an similar to 45% smaller tumor burden when compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS:  Novel therapies based on the immunogenic properties of melanoma
combined with molecular technologies may offer promise for an effective and
safe treatment of melanoma."  The corresponding author for this study is:  RB

Gene Therapy Overview
Hanania, E.G.; Kavanagh, J.; Hortobagyi, G.; Giles, R.E.; Champlin, R.;
Deisseroth, A.B.  "Recent Advances in the Application of Gene Therapy to Human
Disease."  American Journal of Medicine, November 1995;99(5):537-552.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Medicine, "PURPOSE:  To review the recent advances in the application of
genetic modification strategies to the therapy of human diseases for which a
molecular defect is known.  METHODS:  A computerized data bank search, the
minutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee published in the Federal Record, and reports of human clinical
trials were used as data sources for this review.  Clinical trials included in
this review were published in the literature or approved by the NIH
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee.  STUDY SELECTION:  Evaluations of the
efficacy of genetic modification strategies in clinical trials in human and in
animal models are summarized.  The design and outcome of the genetic
modification strategies employed are reviewed for 16 marking trials, 16 gene
replacement trials for molecular deficiency diseases, 3 chemoprotection and 4
chemotherapy sensitization trials, 11 cancer vaccine trials, 2 antisense
oligonucleotide trials, and 3 molecular immunotherapy trials.  DATA SYNTHESIS:
The marking trials have shown that residual leukemia cells in the infused
autologous marrow can contribute to relapse following autologous bone marrow
transplants.  The use of genetic modification for the replacement of missing
or deficient genes in severe combined immunodeficiency, familial
hypercholesterolemia, and cystic fibrosis has been associated with encouraging
results so far.  Clinical genetic therapy trials involving cancer vaccines,
antisense oligonucleotides, adoptive immunotherapy with genetically modified T
cells, delivery vectors containing interleukin-1 receptor inhibitor for
arthritis, replacement strategies for storage diseases, and genetic
suppression of human immunodeficiency viral replication are just commencing.
CONCLUSIONS:  The clinical application of genetic modification techniques has
thus far been successful in the beginning phases of this field.  These early
results suggest that continuation of gene therapy trials designed to correct
the molecular changes that lead to disease states in humans is warranted.
Evaluation of such clinical trials in the future may be based on the analysis
of assays for short-term surrogate endpoints, as well as on the therapeutic
outcomes of the trial, such as survival or remission."  The corresponding

Monoclonal Antibodies
Desrues, B.; Lena, H.; Brichory, F.; Ramee, M.P.; Toujas, L.; Delaval, P.;
Dazord, L.  "Monoclonal Antibody Po66 Uptake by Human Lung Tumours Implanted
in Nude Mice:  Effect of Co-Administration with Doxorubicin."  British Journal

of Cancer, November 1995;72(5):1076-1082.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in British Journal
of Cancer, "The efficacy of radioimmunotherapy of tumours with radiolabelled
monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) depends on the amount of antibody taken up by the
tumour and on its intratumoral distribution.  In the case of MAbs directed
against intracellular antigens, increasing the permeability of the cytoplasmic
membrane may augment the bioavailability of the antigen for the antibody.
This raises the question whether the induction of tumour necrosis by
chemotherapy can enhance the tumour uptake of radiolabelled monoclonal
antibodies.  In this work, the effect of doxorubicin on the biodistribution of
Po66, an MAb directed against an intracellular antigen, was studied in nude
mice grafted with the human non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell line SK-MES-1.
After injection on day 0 of I-125-labelled Po66, tumour radioactivity
increased up to days 3-5, and then remained unchanged to day 14.  The combined
administration of I-125-labelled Po66 with 8 mg kg(-1) doxorubicin, in two
doses separated by 7 days, doubled the radioactivity retained by the tumour.
Histological and historadiographic analysis showed, however, that the drug
induced cellular damage.  In the absence of doxorubicin, the accumulation of
Po66 was restricted to some necrotic areas, whereas with doxorubicin the
necrosis was more extensive and the antibody more evenly distributed.  These
results suggest that chemotherapy and immunoradiotherapy combined would
enhance tumour uptake of radioisotope and promote more homogenous distribution
of the radiolabelled MAb.  This would promote eradication of the remaining
drug-resistant cells in tumours."  The corresponding author for this study is:

Animal Models
Mouse Model Useful for Determining TB Pathology


A murine study suggests that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is far more virulent
when given by the respiratory route than by the intravenous route.

Researcher Robert J.  North of New York's Trudeau Institute earlier reported
that intravenous inoculation of mice with M.  tuberculosis results in a slowly
progressive infection in the lungs, despite the acquisition of systemic host
immunity capable of resolving infection in the liver, spleen and kidneys.

"The present study was undertaken to determine whether the peculiar
susceptibility of the lungs to M.  tuberculosis infection is even more obvious
in mice infected via the respiratory route," North wrote ("M.  tuberculosis is
Strikingly More Virulent for Mice When Given via the Respiratory than via the
Intravenous Route," Journal of Infectious Diseases, December
1995;172:1550-1553).

North found that fewer M.  tuberculosis colony-forming units (cfu) given by
aerosol were substantially more virulent for mice than much larger numbers
inoculated intravenously, as shown by a faster rate of bacillary growth in the
lungs and much shorter survival of the host.

"Earlier death of mice infected by aerosol was associated with faster
development of lung pathology, even though the number of M.  tuberculosis
given intravenously resulted in the same number of bacilli initially
implanting in the lungs as the number given by aerosol," North wrote.  "Mice
depleted of CD4 T cells died of infection much sooner than immunocompetent
mice but at about the same time after being infected via either route."

North noted that mice infected by aerosol, in contrast with those given M.
tuberculosis intravenously were incapable of resolving infection in their
livers, indicating that they generated and expressed a lower level of systemic
immunity.

"This interpretation is in keeping with the finding that mice depleted of CD4
T cells died at about the same time after infection was initiated via either
route and much earlier than immunocompetent controls," North wrote.  "In
addition, the survival time of mice infected via the respiratory route was
greatly extended if they were also infected intravenously with a larger number
of M.  tuberculosis.  Thus, a larger number of M.  tuberculosis cfu given
intravenously induces a higher level of systemic immunity than does a smaller
number given by aerosol.  This likely occurs because a larger intravenous
inoculum represents a larger quantity of replicating antigen capable of
engaging larger amounts of lymphoid tissue, including that in the spleen."

North concludes that bacilli that reach the lungs via the respiratory route
have a growth advantage over those that enter from blood during the initial
stage of infection.

"This may be because microorganisms that enter the lung via the respiratory
route are ingested by resident alveolar macrophages, whereas those that enter
from the blood need to be carried into the organ after being ingested by
monocytes, neutrophils, or pulmonary intravascular macrophages.

"Given that resident alveolar macrophages tend to be less capable than other
macrophages of killing microbial pathogens in general, it is possible that
this enables M.  tuberculosis to grow more rapidly during the initial stage of
infection.  Results of the present study support this concept in that M.
tuberculosis that entered the lung directly grew faster during the first 20
days of infection than did M.  tuberculosis that entered from blood."

Institute, Inc., P.O.  Box 59, Saranac Lake, New York 12983.

Blood Banking (Chagas Disease)
Donors with T. cruzi Pose Threat to Public Health


Trypanosoma cruzi (T.  cruzi), the cause of Chagas disease, may be a
considerable public health problem in parts of the United States.

Almost one in 5,700 blood donors in Miami, Florida and nearly one in 11,600 in
Los Angeles, California were seropositive for T.  cruzi antibodies in a
large-scale seroepidemiological study, said D.A.  Leiby, Transmissible
Diseases Department, American Red Cross, Rockville, Maryland, and colleagues
("Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma Cruzi-Antibodies in a Subpopulation of
American Red Cross Blood Donors," abstract 387, American Journal of Tropical
Medicine and Hygiene, 1995;53(2):215).

"Despite the absence of demonstrated T.  cruzi transmission by transfusion,
the finding of seroreactive donors suggests that a significant public health
problem may exist," Leiby et al.  wrote in their presentation abstract.  They
presented their findings at the 44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of
Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, San Antonio, Texas, November 17-21, 1995.

The study was performed with the Southern California and the South Florida
Regions of the American Red Cross and Abbott Laboratories.

All volunteer blood donors in the Los Angeles and Miami Red Cross blood
centers were asked a question about their place of birth or amount of time
spent in regions endemic for T.  cruzi.  Those donors who answered "yes" and a
control group were tested for the presence of T.  cruzi antibodies by EIA
(manufactured by Abbott Laboratories).

The researchers confirmed by RIPA those samples that were repeatedly reactive
by EIA.  They then entered into case-control and look-back investigations
those donors who were confirmed T.  cruzi seroreactive.

Of the donors questioned about risk, 7.4 percent (14,480/196,832) in Los
Angeles and 11 percent (1,868/17,043) in Miami responded yes.  Of these who
answered affirmatively, 20 were confirmed by RIPA (17 donors in Los Angeles;
three in Miami).  Among these 20 individuals, the risk factor they all shared
was birth in and extended residence in a country endemic for T.  cruzi.

A look-back investigation of eight patients who previously had received blood
from the infected donors showed that none of the blood recipients had
transfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi.

While none of the blood recipients in this particular study had
transfusion-transmitted T.  cruzi infection, there are documented reports of
three cases of transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease in the United States and
one case in Canada (according to a report by Ira A.  Schulman, M.D., Director
of Transfusion Medicine, LA County/USC Medical Center, delivered at the Blood
Safety & Screening Conference, October 23-25, 1995, Washington, D.C.).

Within the past 25 years, millions of immigrants have come to the United
States from countries where T.  cruzi is endemic.

Since 1991, an estimated 100,000 individuals infected with T.  cruzi reside in
North America.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
"New" ACTG Moves Forward


Can the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaur
too large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?

According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - University
of Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization has
accomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the Twentieth
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,
D.C.

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)
responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.

But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs in
adults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and for
moving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDS
therapies.

DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of the
ACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since the
changes took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms were
valid, but also stressed the group's many achievements.

"We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said.
"But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is the
preeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together a
tremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."

Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for the
treatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTG
efforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way.

"This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugs
work," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."

Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combination
therapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the new
protease inhibitor saquinavir.

He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings
"to tell us what we need to do."

The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  But
most importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by which
it generates clinical trial protocols.

"One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving like
civil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processes
that prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.

The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult section
has only three committees making research decisions.  These three Research
Agenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and the
Opportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - the
Pharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient Care
Committee - will now be established as standing resource committees within
each of the three main RACs.

There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will be
centralized control of both resources and laboratories.

Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing the
ACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised of
the various committee chairs.

Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,
receiving their funds directly from DAIDS.

"Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "I
think this will work very well."

But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue to
change.

"Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," he
said.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."

He called for the active participation of each investigator.

"Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executive
committee members," Schooley said.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

Disease Markers
Increased Soluble CD14 Useful Marker in TB Patients


Increased levels of soluble CD14 are present in bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.

CD14 was first identified as a marker of cells derived from the
monocyte/macrophage lineage, although it was later found on other cells like
neutrophils and B lymphocytes.  The cell surface glycoprotein serves as a
cellular receptor for complexes of lipopolysaccharide with
lipopolysaccharide-binding protein.

Soluble CD14 (sCD14) is present in normal plasma and is found increased in
serum of patients with septicemia, polytrauma, and sarcoidosis.  In pulmonary
sarcoidosis, increased levels of soluble CD14 have been detected in serum and
in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.  In this study researcher Gerhard Hoheisel
and colleagues attempted to determine whether increased levels of CD14 are
also found in pulmonary tuberculosis ("Increased Soluble CD14 Levels in
Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid in Primary TB," Chest, December
1995;108:1614-1616).

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 12 patients with active but untreated
pulmonary tuberculosis and 12 healthy persons.  Cytologic and immunologic
characteristics were determined.  sCD14 was measured by a sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

"The level of soluble CD14 in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was
increased compared with controls (mean +/- 34.4 +/- ng/mL versus 11.5 +/- 22
ng/mL)," Hoheisel et al.  wrote.

"No correlation was found between sCD14 levels and bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.  We conclude that similar to
patients with sarcoidosis, increased BAL fluid levels of sCD14 are found in
patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared with controls.  Moreover,
this finding might signal a similar immunopathogenetic process contributing to
granuloma formation in both diseases.  Further studies of respective cell
surface markers and endogenous cytokine production seem necessary to determine
the significance and clinical relevance of this finding."

Pneumology, Ruhrlandklink, Tuschener Weg 40, D-45239.

Drug Resistance
When the Antibiotic Cupboard Is Bare


Antibiotic treatment options are very scarce when vancomycin does not work
against life-threatening Gram-positive infections, according to a scientific
presentation given at the midyear clinical meeting of the American Society of
Health-Systems Pharmacists (ASHP), held in Las Vegas, Nevada.

"For patients with life-threatening infections that are resistant to currently
available antibiotics, the situation can be as bad as it was 54 years ago when
the United States entered World War II, and there were no antibiotics on the
medical supply shelves," said Chuck Ballow, Pharm.  D., Associate Clinical
Professor at the State University of New York in Buffalo and Director of
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring at Millard Fillmore Hospital.  "The first
penicillins were so scarce they were delivered to field hospitals in
briefcases chained to couriers' wrists."

Over the past few years, Enterococcus faecium (E.  faecium) has developed the
ability to survive and grow in the presence of vancomycin.  This bacterium is
relatively benign in healthy patients, but in those with multiple underlying
diseases, who are often hospitalized for extended periods, this pathogen can
be deadly.

The U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report an overall
incidence of 14 percent for vancomycin-resistant E.  faecium (VREF) in U.S.
intensive care units.

The death rate for VREF infections exceeds 30 percent in the studies reported
to date, compared to less than 17 percent in patients infected with less
resistant bacteria.

One reason for the increased incidence in resistance is that the Enterococcus
resides in the digestive tract, where resistant strains survive.  Ordinarily,
E.  faecium is relatively harmless, but, as patients are hospitalized due to
chronic illness or additional surgeries and they become increasingly
debilitated, even harmless bacteria overpower their diminishing host defenses.
E.  faecium has outsmarted vancomycin by changing the structure of its cell
wall through a complex interplay of genetic material that has become the most
complicated mechanism of resistance observed to date.

Today, after the introduction of many bigger, better and broader spectrum
antibiotics and the administration of literally millions of doses, the war
against bacteria wages on.  On an increasing number of fronts, the bugs have
outsmarted the drugs.

Ballow said this has happened because of a lack of appreciation for the
incredible adaptability of bacteria and the availability of hundreds of
antibiotic options.  Most pharmaceutical companies turned their attention to
developing new drugs for such diseases as heart attacks, cancer and diabetes,
instead of focusing on antibiotics.

In addition, many infectious disease experts felt confident that the
life-threatening Gram-positive resistance problems they faced in hospitals
could be handled by vancomycin, an antibiotic used for multiresistant
organisms unresponsive to the most sophisticated combinations of agents.

"Of course, this was naive in retrospect," Ballow told fellow pharmacists.
"Today we have a major problem, especially in intensive-care units."

The first agent in a class of antibiotics known as streptogramins may provide
hope against VREF.  Synercid (quinupristin-dalfopristin), an injectable
antibiotic shown to be effective against VREF, is in Phase III clinical trials
worldwide, and is currently available in the United States and Europe through
an emergency use program sponsored and administered by its developer,
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc.  (RPR), Collegeville, Pennsylvania.

Ballow reported on preliminary results of this program, which showed, overall,
70 percent of 95 evaluable patients treated with Synercid responded favorably
to the agent, meaning their symptoms improved or resolved.

Sixty-seven percent of patients with bacteremia (the most severe and
life-threatening infections) showed improvement and eradication of the
bacteria.

Ballow believes that these results are significant and promising because these
patients had serious underlying medical conditions, and each had been
previously and unsuccessfully treated with up to 11 antibiotics.

The new antibiotic is made of two individually active molecules, each of which
alone mildly halt reproduction of the bacteria, but combined have the power to
kill bacteria through inhibition of protein synthesis.

The agent has also been shown to be highly effective in laboratory tests
against the major Gram-positive strains of E.  faecium, Staphylococcus aureus,
pneumococci, and Streptococcus, including multidrug-resistant strains.

Some older drugs, which have been rarely used, if at all, for many years, may
also provide some hope, but additional studies are necessary to establish the
effectiveness of these agents in the treatment of VREF.

Emerging Diseases
Could Rabies-Like Diseases Enter the U.S.?


Rabies-like diseases could cause epidemics in the U.S.  if infected animals
are imported from endemic areas, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) researchers warn.

Although each year rabies kills 40,000 to 100,000 people worldwide, only one
or two deaths occur in the U.S.  due to widespread vaccination of domestic
animals, effective (but costly) post-exposure treatment (PET), and recent
programs to vaccinate wild animals.

This reduction in mortality is expensive:  the U.S.  rabies prevention program
costs an estimated $230 million to $1 billion in public and private expenses
per year, reported Charles E.  Rupprecht and colleagues of the CDC in a recent
publication ("The Ascension of Wildlife Rabies:  A Cause for Public Health
Concern or Intervention?"  Emerging Infectious Diseases, 1995;1(4):107ff).

But little-understood cousins of the rabies virus that exist outside the U.S.
are at best only marginally susceptible to rabies vaccine.  Either accidental
or intentional importation of infected animals to non-endemic areas raise the
animal reservoir - for most if not all of these viruses are from various
species of bats.

"Infections with non-rabies lyssaviruses have resulted in rabies vaccine
failures," Rupprecht et al.  noted.  "Such infections raise the specter of
potentially serious public health consequences if introduced and subsequently
established in susceptible bat populations."

Members of the Lyssavirus genus are a group of genetically related
negative-stranded RNA viruses.  The viruses that cause rabies are the
rhabdoviridae, found everywhere except for Australia, Antarctica, and some
isolated islands.  Other Lyssaviruses include:

* Mokola virus.  The reservoir for this virus is unknown, but Rupprecht et al.
suggest that it may be some type of insectivore or rodent as it was first
isolated in a species of shrew trapped in 1968 in the Mokola Forest outside
Ibadan, Nigeria; bushveld gerbils in Zimbabwe were found to be seropositive.
Cases have occurred in Nigeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Central
African Republic, and Ethiopia.  There have been two documented human
infections.  Rabies vaccine does not protect against this virus.

* Lagosbat virus.  The reservoir for this virus is thought to be fruit bats.
Only 10 cases have been identified thus far, three in domestic animals, in
Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the Central African Republic, Senegal, and
Ethiopia.  No human deaths are documented.  Rabies virus offers only marginal
protection.

* Duvenhage virus.  The reservoir for this virus is not known, but is
suspected to be insect-eating bats.  Cases have occurred in South Africa,
Zimbabwe, and Senegal.  The virus is named after a man from Pretoria, South
Africa who in 1970 developed rabies-like encephalitis after being bitten by a
bat.  The patient died.  No cases in domestic animals have been identified.
Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 1 (EBLV1).  The reservoir for this virus is a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Eptesicus serotinus.  One human case
was documented in 1985, another was suspected in 1977.  Although the virus has
been found in more than 400 bats, no cases in domestic animals have been
identified.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBLV2).  The reservoirs for this virus is again a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Mytotis dasycneme.  The virus was
first identified in a Swiss bat biologist working in Finland who died of a
rabies-like illness.  Of the five known cases, none have occurred in domestic
animals.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

"The distances between Africa, Eurasia, Pacific Oceania, and the New World
mitigate against the dispersal, migration, and introduction of healthy bats
without human intervention," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "However, several
recent events illustrate the opportunity for the transoceanic transfer of
rabies-infected bats."

These events include:

* Research institutions.  There have been two close calls in research
facilities.  Canadian researchers in 1986 shipped a live big brown bat
(Eptesicus fuscus) to German associates.  The bat became ill was diagnosed
with rabies.  In 1994, a Massachusetts research team collected 12 wild big
brown bats and sent them to Danish researchers.  Six of the bats died of
rabies.

* Commercial enterprises.  A big brown bat was captured in Hawaii on a
container ship carrying automobiles from Michigan.  The bat was rabid.

* Legal or illegal importation of animals.  Improperly issued federal permits
in 1994 permitted import to the U.S.  of thousands of bats, mostly Egyptian
tomb bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus).  Normally, sales of imported bats or their
offspring are prohibited by federal law except by research institutions or
zoos where contact with the public is limited.  Such bats are normally
subjected to extended quarantine.  The CDC warns people who own imported bats
to prevent contact with humans.

"Although no reports of lyssaviruses isolated from Egyptian fruit bats exist,
active surveillance for such viruses has not been conducted," Rupprecht et al.
warned.  "These bats are relatively common and widespread throughout the area
that extends from Turkey and Cyprus to Pakistan, the Arabian peninsula, Egypt,
and most of sub-Saharan Africa.  Because they may roost by the thousands in a
wide variety of habitats, there is ample opportunity for interaction with
other Chiroptera, such as the widely distributed straw-colored (Eidolon
helvum) or epauletted (Epomophorus wahlbergi) fruit bats; both of these
species have been implicated in Lyssavirus epizootiology in Africa.

"The adaptability of Egyptian fruit bats should be a cause for concern because
of the potential for survival and interaction among indigenous bat fauna,
particularly in the southern United States."

Such a disaster would not be the first importation of a lyssavirus to the
United States.  While folklore recounts tales of bat-spread disease prior to
European colonization of the New World, the importation of dogs and red foxes
for the sport of fox hunting led to widespread epizootics.

When rabies became a nationally reported disease in 1938, limited surveillance
revealed 9,412 cases per year - mostly in domestic animals - with 47 human
deaths.  Rabies control efforts for pet dogs began in the 1920s and by 1960
rabies occurred more often in wild than in domestic animals.

From 1961 to 1989, skunks were the primary U.S.  reservoir for rabies but they
were then supplanted by raccoons, probably boosted by transport of infected
animals from southern states.

Along with this change in animal vectors, the human epidemiology of rabies has
changed.  Until 1965, most up to 80 percent of human cases occurred after a
known exposure, usually a dog bite.  But in the last 10 years - with the 1975
advent of a more effective canine vaccine - rabies deaths occurred in people
who had no history of an animal bite.

"Almost all the recent human cases occurred after an animal exposure that was
unrecognized by the patient as carrying a risk for rabies infection,"
Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "The apparent source of human rabies has also
changed:  14 of the 18 cases acquired in the United States since 1980 involved
rabies variants associated with insectivorous bats."

As noted above, the cost of rabies protection is high.  Rupprecht et al.
noted that the New York State rabies diagnostic laboratory received 3,000
submissions in 1989, but received 12,000 submissions in 1993 after the
epizootic of raccoon rabies reached the state.

"The cost per human life saved from rabies ranges from approximately $10,000
to $100 million, depending on the nature of the exposure and the probability
of rabies in a region," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.

"What's more, most economic analyses do not take into account the
psychological trauma caused by human exposure to rabies, the subsequent
euthanasia of pets, or the loss of wildlife resources during rabies outbreaks.
Rabies in wildlife has now reached historically high levels in the United
States, and the costs of preventing human rabies are mounting."

Rupprecht, chief of the CDC Rabies Section, and colleagues argue strongly
against population reduction of animal vectors for rabies on ecological,
economic, and ethical grounds.  They instead promote oral vaccination programs
for wildlife, a concept first proposed in the 1960s by the CDC.

"Oral rabies vaccination of the red fox with vaccine-laden baits is an
integral aspect of rabies control throughout southeastern Canada and Europe,
where more than 75 million doses of vaccine have been distributed over 5
million km(2) during the past two decades," they wrote.  "Consequently, rabies
incidence among wild and domestic animals has fallen, as have PETS for human
rabies."

However, the shift of the epizootic from foxes to raccoons required an
extensive laboratory and field research effort, as the vaccines effective for
foxes were ineffective for raccoons and coyotes.

"In 1983, a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant virus vaccine was
developed that has proven to be an effective oral immunogen in raccoons and
various other important reservoir species; vaccine advantages include improved
thermostability and an inability to cause rabies," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.
"When vaccine-laden baits are offered under natural conditions, contact with
them by nontarget wildlife species cannot be totally excluded.  However,
studies of V-RG virus have shown no vaccine-associated morbidity, mortality,
or gross pathologic lesions in more than 40 warm-blooded vertebrate species
examined."

An efficacy field trial of the V-RG vaccine took place in Cape May, New
Jersey, between spring 1992 and autumn 1994.  Nearly 100,000 fishmeal baits
laced with vaccine were distributed over 56,000 hectares both by hand and by
helicopter.  Overall rabies incidence and rate of spread was significantly
reduced.

Although oral wildlife vaccination programs are currently in Massachusetts,
New York, Florida, and southern Texas, Rupprecht et al.  noted that there are
many questions yet to be answered:

* What is the optimal ratio of animal population density to bait density?

* What level of herd immunity will be required to eliminate rabies?

* What is the best way to distribute the vaccine bait?

* How can the methods successful for foxes and raccoons be adapted to rabies
control in species such as skunks, mongooses, and dogs?

* Who will fund these programs over time?

* What do rabies control and prevention efforts really cost?

"Given the problems inherent in wildlife control, the greater issue of
extending these methods to the control of dog rabies in the developing world
will be a challenge well into the next century," Rupprecht et al.  concluded.

Encephalitis
Microsphere Formulation Improves Encephalitis Vaccine


Mouse studies show that it may be possible to make a safe vaccine against a
deadly form of viral encephalitis.

Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus - an alphavirus of the family
Togaviridae - is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fatal human infections
during epizootics among horses.

The most effective vaccine against VEE virus is the live attenuated Trinidad
donkey strain TC-83.  But not only do 20 percent of vaccinated humans and
animals fail to develop neutralizing antibody titers to TC-83, evidence
suggests that the vaccine may cause birth defects and diabetes.  Moreover,
there is concern that the vaccine strain could revert to its virulent form.

The alternative to TC-83 is the formalin-killed whole virus vaccine C-84.
While this vaccine is safe, it is far less effective than the live attenuated
vaccine and requires multiple injections for induction of immunity.

Now researcher Terrence E.  Greenway of the University of Alabama, Birmingham,
and colleagues have developed a microsphere delivery system for killed VEE
virus that is apparently both safe and immunogenic.  They reported their
results in the journal Vaccine ("Enhancement of Protective Immune Responses to
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) Virus with Microencapsulated Vaccine,"
Vaccine, 1995;13(15):1411-20).

"The microencapsulated VEE virus vaccine induced systemic immune responses
which were higher and persisted longer than those induced with the free virus
vaccine," Greenway et al.  wrote.  "The microencapsulated virus was more
effective than the free virus in inducing immune responses protective against
systemic challenge with virulent VEE virus."

Biodegradable polymer microspheres were developed over the last decade as a
means of releasing contraceptive steroids.  Vaccinologists were quick to see
the potential benefits of this technology.

"Microsphere technology has the potential benefits of reducing the number of
inoculations, enhancing the immune response via both parenteral and oral
vaccination routes, and in reducing the total antigen dose required to achieve
immune protection," wrote researcher M.C.  Steinhoff of the Center for
Immunization Research, Baltimore, Maryland, in a recent review (Vaccine,
January 1994;12(1):5-11).

Greenway and colleagues noted that a number of different research teams have
shown poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) or DL-PLG microspheres to be effective
vehicles for augmenting immune responses to antigen administered either
mucosally or systemically.

Various types of DL-PLG-based vaccines have already been proven safe in
humans.

Greenway et al.  created several versions of DL-PLG microencapsulated VEE
virus and compared their immunogenicity and protective efficacy to that of
free virus vaccine in BALB/c mice.

Subcutaneous immunization with 50 (micro)g microencapsulated VEE virus yielded
anti-VEE antibody titers up to 32 times higher than that seen with free virus.

When the mice that had received the microencapsulated vaccine received a
second booster immunization, their antibody responses remained stable
throughout the 100-day observation period.  Antibody levels began to wane only
in mice boosted with free virus.

"At high vaccine doses (i.e.  25 or 50 (micro)g), microspheres prepared with
either methylene chloride or ethyl acetate were equally effective in inducing
specific anti-VEE virus antibody response after both the primary and secondary
immunization," Greenway et al.  observed.  "However, when a lower dose (12.5
(micro)g) of the vaccines was tested, methylene chloride processed
microspheres induced higher antibody responses after both the primary and
secondary immunization.  ...  The solvent ethyl acetate reduced the
immunogenicity of formalin-fixed, inactivated VEE virus during the
microencapsulation procedure."

In addition, the researchers found that formalin-fixed VEE was far better than
non-formalin-fixed VEE for use in the microspheres.

"Formalin fixation of the whole inactivated VEE virus vaccine prior to
microencapsulation with the solvent methylene chloride dramatically enhanced
the immunogenicity of the final product, presumably through enhanced
conformational stability," they wrote.

In the mouse experiments, 80 percent of mice immunized with a single dose of 5
(micro)g VEE virus in microspheres prepared with methylene chloride survived
challenge with virulent VEE virus.  Only 20 percent of mice that received the
free virus vaccine survived challenge.

"At a high vaccine dose (i.e., 50 (micro)g), the microencapsulated vaccines
afforded 100 percent protection, whereas a similar dose of free antigen
resulted in 40 percent survival in one experiment and 100 percent survival in
a second experiment," Greenway et al.  wrote.

"These results, taken together with the protection results after secondary
immunization with either free or microencapsulated virus vaccine, indicate
that a single immunization with the microsphere vaccine could afford
protection similar to that attained with multiple immunizations with the free
virus vaccine."

The researchers are currently exploring the effectiveness of microencapsulated
VEE virus administered by various routes in protecting against aerosol
challenge with virulent VEE virus.

Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama 35294.

Epidemiology (HCV)
500,000 in France Infected with HCV


At least half-a-million people in France are infected with hepatitis C virus,
according to that country's Ministry of Health.

The figures were released for the first time in an effort to clarify how many
people in France actually had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.  The Ministry
of Health report is the result of seven epidemiologic surveys conducted during
1994 and 1995 by teams of experts including virologists and specialists in
public health.  It was prepared by the National Public Health Network.

Details of the report were published in the November 4, 1995, British Journal
of Medicine (311:1187-1188).

According to the survey, at least 60 percent of the infections were
transmitted by blood transfusions or by illicit injection drug use.  The
prevalence of infections among health staff is not known but was estimated as
high as 3 percent.

The surveys included one study of 20,000 pregnant women and another involving
6,000 volunteers from the roles of people insured under the social security
system.  Results agreed with statistics gathered during routine screening of
blood donors.

Additional studies will be conducted to look at the prevalence of infection
among children and young people under the age of 20 and in people over 60.  A
survey among 6,300 people who attended routine health checks showed that
one-third of those who were seropositive had received a blood transfusion and
that one-third of those infected were not aware of their seropositivity.

It is estimated that 600 new cases of hepatitis C will be diagnosed each year
in France and that 3,500 to 5,000 patients should benefit from treatment with
interferon.

According to the report many doctors were reluctant to use this treatment,
even though studies have shown that the earlier it is started the more
effective it is.

Epidemiology (HIV)
WHO Reports 18.5 Million Have HIV


An estimated 18.5 million people worldwide are infected with HIV - a sharply
higher number attributed to better reporting rather a surge in the epidemic,
the United Nations (U.N.)  health agency said.

About six million people are thought to have developed AIDS since the start of
the epidemic in the late 1970s, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.  Of
these, 4.5 million have died.

An estimated 6,000 people are infected each day with HIV; of the 18.5 million
already infected, 1.5 million are children, the agency said.

WHO previously estimated that 1 million children and between 13 million and 15
million adults are infected with HIV and a total of 4.5 million people had
developed the disease.

The agency said the new figures reflected an improvement in estimating
techniques, better HIV prevalence studies and other research, rather than a
sudden jump in new infections.

Two-thirds of the estimated HIV cases and three-quarters of advanced AIDS
cases, are in sub-Saharan Africa, WHO said.

India has the most HIV carriers - an estimated 1.75 million of its one billion
people.  Thailand - another country where experts fear an explosion in cases -
has 700,000 HIV carriers.

The highest proportional HIV rate was in Botswana, with about 18 percent of
sexually active adults infected.  An estimated 17 percent of adults aged 15-49
had the virus in Zambia and Zimbabwe and 15 percent in Uganda.

In the Americas, Haiti had the highest proportion of HIV carriers, at 4.4
percent.  The Bahamas followed at 3.9 percent, with Barbados at 2.8 percent.
In the United States, where an estimated 700,000 people were HIV positive at
the end of 1994, the infection rate was 0.5 percent.

In Europe, Spain had the highest rate of HIV infections, with 0.58 percent of
sexually active adults, followed by Switzerland with 0.2 percent, WHO said.
WHO is forced to rely on estimates to gauge the spread of HIV and AIDS because
actual cases reported by governments give little idea of the true picture,
especially in Africa.

North Korea reports no cases of HIV.

Although WHO estimated the true number of AIDS cases at six million, the
actual number reported by governments was 1.3 million.  The United States
accounted for 39 percent of all the reported cases but only 7 percent of the
estimated cases.

The figures for HIV infections are for the end of 1994, while the AIDS figures
include cases that developed in 1995.  A WHO official said there was a slight
overlap in the two categories.

Infection Control
TB and AIDS Programs - Natural Partners or Not?


Can tuberculosis and AIDS prevention and treatment programs be successfully
combined?

The question was debated during a tuberculosis (TB) conference in Paris with
researchers expressing differing views.

D.A.  Enarson of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
(IUATLD) argued that tuberculosis and AIDS prevention services are less than
compatible, because they target different groups.

"Tuberculosis prevention is a medical services related activity whereas HIV
prevention is a general population activity," Enarson noted.

"Because of the difference in the point of implementation of the two programs,
attempts to combine them are difficult."

Enarson made the remarks at the 1995 annual meeting of the IUATLD Conference
on Global Lung Health, held in Paris, France.

Enarson noted that while the goal of TB and HIV prevention programs is the
same - to prevent infections - the focus must be different.

"In the case of tuberculosis, prevention is based on a strategy of case
management in which infectious cases are found and treated, thereby preventing
transmission from the source (the sick patient)," Enarson noted in an abstract
presented at the conference.  "This is the only means of primary prevention.
Persons with the infection who are not sick almost never transmit the
infection to others.  With HIV infection, transmission occurs from an infected
person who usually has no clinical evidence of the infection.

"Prevention of transmission of this infection is, in general, based on general
health education aimed at behavior modification, Thus, the point of
implementation of the two programs is quite different:  for HIV, the point of
implementation must be the general population of subsets of it."

R.  O'Brien of the World Health Organization's Global Tuberculosis Program
countered that collaboration between AIDS and tuberculosis programs is
essential if services for already-infected persons are to be efficiently
implement.

"Isoniazid preventive therapy for co-infected persons may be highly effective,
but little work on its programmatic application has been undertaken," O'Brien
noted.  "Testing of TB patients for HIV may provide for better patient care
and help reduce HIV transmission, but voluntary testing with counselling is
not widely available."

O'Brien noted that virtually no home-based care programs for AIDS patients
with TB exist, even though these programs may help alleviate the burden on TB
programs and prevent further TB transmission in households.

O'Brien also found efforts to control nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis
to be lacking.

"AIDS and TB programs have unique expertise and orientations which together
can address the problems," he wrote in an abstract presented to the IUATLD
meeting.

"Unfortunately, until now these factors have been used as excuses for working
separately rather than for seeking fruitful collaboration.  However, TB is now
recognized as the most important opportunistic infection and cause of death in
HIV infected persons worldwide.  TB and HIV/AIDS programs can no longer be
permitted to function in isolation and must collaborate to improve care and
preventive services for those suffering from this 'deadly duo'."

The World Health Organization's E.  van Praag agreed that home-care programs
for people with AIDS offer unique opportunities to control tuberculosis in
developing areas.

"Over the last few years initiatives to set up community-based or home care
programs for people and families living with HIV/AIDS have mushroomed
rapidly," van Praag wrote in an abstract of a presentation to the IUATLD
conference.  "In countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, between 50-100
different home care programs can be identified (Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Thailand).  These initiatives are a response to needs felt by HIV affected
families, communities and health staff in environments where hospitals can
scarcely cope and economic survival and social status of those families have
seriously deteriorated, due to AIDS.

"More than half of the people with HIV related illness will develop
tuberculosis.  Early recognition of tuberculosis and chances to complete
treatment are again hampered by limited collaboration within various health
care programs and by AIDS specific issues such as recurrent illnesses and
reduced income to afford frequent return visits.  Opportunities exist within
home care programs where peripheral health and social staff are in close
contact with patients and family care givers to early recognize TB disease
among HIV infected and affected family members.  Home care staff could provide
drugs, supervise DOT and educate families and communities about HIV and TB
prevention and care.  Projects in Ghana, Zimbabwe and South Africa have
already implemented joint TB and AIDS home care programs."

Researcher D.A.  Enarson is from the IUATLD, Paris, France.  R.  O'Brien and
E.  van Praag are from the Global Tuberculosis Program and the Global Program

Influenza
Killer Flu Expected


Influenza could develop a new form and trigger a worldwide epidemic at any
time, experts caution.

At a conference of more than 200 infectious disease specialists, work has
started on a plan to prepare for what some believe is an inevitable pandemic,
or worldwide epidemic, of killer flu.

John LaMontagne of the U.S.  National Institutes of Health (NIH) said at the
conference that the flu virus is "dynamic and very resourceful" and can change
rapidly into forms that overwhelm natural human defenses.  "We anticipate we
will have another pandemic, but we don't know when," he said.

Dr.  Dominick Iacuzio of the U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said concern about another pandemic led to his
organizing the conference.  "It has happened before, and it can happen again,"
he said.

The last major worldwide flu epidemic was in 1968, the so-called "Hong Kong
flu."  New strains of the flu virus typically sweep through the international
population every ten to 40 years.

"Some experts say we are overdue," said Iacuzio.

Alan Hansen of the World Health Organization (WHO) said modern transportation
makes it possible for new flu viruses to touch every continent within a matter
of weeks - it once took many months.

In 1918-1919, a new viral strain infected more than 2 billion people and
killed an estimated 20 million to 40 million.  The "Asian flu" in 1957 was
also new and caused 750,000 deaths in the United States alone.

Iacuzio said the Bethesda, Maryland, conference was called to help
international experts identify the gaps in what is known about the flu virus
and its control.

A formal report is being prepared, but these findings will be among the
conclusions, he said:

* Increased surveillance, particularly in remote Asian areas, is needed for
early detection of new flu viral strains.  If a potentially new form of the
flu is found early enough, said Iacuzio, the pandemic could be blunted by
rapidly producing a new vaccine.

* Some experts believe the concentration of proteins used in the flu vaccine
could be reduced, thus making more doses available.  "We don't know the
answers to this," said Iacuzio, and that knowledge could be critical if there
is a sudden, worldwide need for vaccine.

* Final work on vaccines that can be applied as nose spray or nose drops must
be completed.  These so-called "cold-adapted vaccines" use modified live virus
and have been shown to be effective in some studies.  Iacuzio said their
availability in a pandemic could save many lives by protecting people against
the disease.

* Antivirals, drugs used to treat the flu infections, could provide physicians
with important new weapons in treating patients already infected.  Iacuzio
said candidate drugs are being tested, but are not available.  Such drugs need
to be speedily developed, he said.

Occupational Exposure (TB)
Most TB in New York HCWs Due to Recent Infections 


A finding that most tuberculosis cases among health care workers in a New York
study were due to recent infections suggests that occupational transmission of
tuberculosis routinely occurs in facilities without recognized tuberculosis
(TB) outbreaks, according to Cornell University's Public Health Research
Institute.

A number of nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred across the United
States during 1990 and 1991, resulting in several deaths among personnel in
contact with infected patients.  These outbreaks prompted the issuance of new
guidelines for health care workers from the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC).

"Since (the implementation of the CDC guidelines) there have been relatively
few reported outbreaks, which suggests that current control measures may be
effective," researcher Kent A Sepkowitz and colleagues wrote ("TB Among Urban
Health Care Workers:  A Study Using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism
Typing," Clinical Infectious Diseases, November 1995;21:1098-1102).

"However, it is not known whether the apparently sporadic cases of
tuberculosis in health care workers are due to occupationally acquired
infections or, as a recent study suggested, are more likely due to
community-acquired infections.  In addition, the risk for HIV infected
personnel is not well defined, although some have suggested that HIV infected
health care workers should have the option of being assigned to an area
associated with a low risk of exposure to tuberculosis."

In this study Sepkowitz and colleagues at New York's Cornell University
Medical College analyzed cases of tuberculosis using laboratory-based active
surveillance system for TB at six hospitals in New York City (members of the
TBNetwork).

Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992 to 1994 were analyzed according
to the occupational status of the patients.

The researchers reviewed medical records and restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was
performed.

"No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in
the study period," Sepkowitz et al.  wrote.  "Occupational status was known
for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing.
Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as
determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease."

RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65 percent) of 20 health care
workers and 50 (41 percent) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered
RFLP pattern.

Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status
revealed that HIV status and health care worker status were independent risk
factors for a clustered RFLP strain.

The recent transmission rate of 65 percent outlined by Sepkowitz et al.  is
greater than that seen among health care workers with tuberculosis in Bern,
Switzerland, San Francisco, California, or the Bronx, New York.

Sepkowitz et al.  conclude that many apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis
among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational
transmission.

The authors note, however, that the cases analyzed in their report probably
reflect transmissions that occurred prior to the time hospitals updated
infection control procedures.

"Our data suggest that occupational transmission of tuberculosis occurs in
hospitals without recognized outbreaks," Sepkowitz et al.  wrote.  "Health
care workers with HIV infection appear to be at particular risk.  Prospective
RFLP-based studies will be useful to confirm these findings and may help
determine the efficacy of current guidelines for preventing transmission of
tuberculosis in health care settings."

Respiratory Syncytial Virus
Human RSV Succumbs to Bioengineering Techniques


Bioengineered production of infectious human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
provides immediate applications for the development of a live attenuated
vaccine.

RSV is considered the most important pediatric viral respiratory pathogen
worldwide.  It is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality and
lacks an approved vaccine or effective antiviral therapy.  In addition to the
lack of a good animal model (other than the chimpanzee), RSV does not grow
well in culture.  Both of these problems have impeded research, making the
development of a vaccine difficult.

Peter L.  Collins et al.  produced infectious human RSV from cloned cDNA
particles in vitro paving the way for development of live attenuated vaccine
strains ("Production of Infectious Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus from
Cloned cDNA Confirms an Essential Role for the Transcription Elongation Factor
from the 5' Proximal Open Reading Frame of the M2 mRNA in Gene Expression and
Provides a Capability for Vaccine Development," Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, December 5, 1995;92(25):11563-67).

"An exciting possibility is that RSV might be engineered in ways that enhance
its immunogenicity and induce a level of protection greater than that provided
by natural infection," noted Collins et al.  In addition "RSV can be evaluated
as a possible vector for protective antigens of other respiratory tract
pathogens.  An RSV vector also might have utility in transient gene therapy of
the respiratory tract."

The cloned RSV was produced by the intracellular coexpression of five
plasmid-born cDNAs.  One encoded a complete positive-sense version of the RSV
genome, and each of the other four encode a separate RSV protein.  If any of
these were deleted, RSV was not produced.  The cDNA segments were synthesized
by reverse transcription (RT)-coupled PCR (RT-PCR) from intracellular RSV mRNA
or virion-derived genome RNA.

They noted that the strategy for producing infections RSV from cDNA-express
antigenome involved its coexpression with those RSV proteins that were
necessary and sufficient to complete two important processes:  1) the ability
to produce an antigenomic nucleocapsid capable of RNA replication and 2) to
render the progeny genomic nucleocapsid competent for both RNA replication and
transcription.  Transcription by the genomic nucleocapsid would then provide
all of the other RSV proteins and initiate a productive infection.

Recently, this approach was successfully accomplished with two rhabdoviruses,
rabies and vesicular stomatitis virus, by M.J.  Schnell et al.  (EMBO J.,
1994;13:4195-4203) and N.D.  Lawson et al.  (PNAS, 1995;92:4477-81).

The possibility also exists that defined mutations can be introduced into
these infectious RSV clones.  This could have multiple applications toward the
understanding of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of this particularly
difficult to study virus.

"It may be possible to insert foreign sequence into the RSV genome for
coexpression," concluded Collins et al.  "Genes of interest for evaluation
include those encoding cytokines, antagonists thereof, or proteins rich in
T-helper-cell epitopes.  This offers the possibility of modifying and
improving the immune response quantitatively and qualitatively."

Infectious Disease, 7 Center Drive, MSC 0720, NIAID, National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-0720, USA.

Transmission (TB)
Primary School Teacher in Amsterdam Infects 19 Students


A primary school teacher with tuberculous laryngitis in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, infected all of his students with tuberculosis (TB) before his
disease was detected.

All 19 children who had been taught by the teacher became infected with TB and
four contracted active disease, according to a report presented at the 1995
Annual Meeting of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung
Disease (IUATLD), held in Paris, France.

"Three months after the start of the new school year, the notification of
primary tuberculosis in two children of the same primary school urged the
local Municipal Health Service to perform source detection and contact
tracing," researcher S.T.  Keizer and colleagues from The Netherlands' Health
Service wrote in an abstract presented at the IUATLD conference.

Extensive testing was conducted and those with a skin induration of 10 mm or
more were considered infected.  A case of primary tuberculosis was defined as
the combination of a positive Mantoux test and compatible radiographic
findings.

"A teacher was identified as the source case," Keizer et al.  wrote.  "At the
time of detection he was without symptoms, yet his chest X-ray showed typical
infiltration of the left upper lobe and his sputum was Ziehl-Neelsen positive.
His medical history revealed that he had been suffering from severe hoarseness
for three months until a benign growth was removed from his vocal cords during
the summer-holidays.  The pathologist had reported the presence of epithelioid
cell granuloma indicating tuberculosis, but this had not reached the attention
of the otorhinolaryngist."

Nearly one-third of all 99 children at the school were found to be infected
with tuberculosis.

"All 19 children who had been taught by our patient until the summer holidays
were infected," Keizer et al.  wrote.  "Among them were four cases of primary
tuberculosis.  In the group (13 children) that had entered his class after the
summer-holidays only one infection was detected.  It is concluded that this
teacher was extremely infectious during the time he was hoarse from a
tuberculous laryngeal lesion.  The consideration of TB in the differential
diagnosis of laryngeal lesions needs emphasis for individual and for public
health reasons."

Xenotransplantation
Baboon BMT Experiment a Reality


Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Structured
Biologicals Inc.  (SBI), Toronto, Ontario, Canada, announced that an SBI
sponsored experiment consisting of a bone-marrow transplant from a baboon to
an AIDS patient took place at a San Francisco, California, hospital.

On July 14, 1995, an advisory panel to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) unanimously recommended that one AIDS patient be allowed to receive an
experimental bone-marrow transplant from a baboon.  Collaborators on the
experiment include Dr.  Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S.  National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr.  Robert Gallo, a pioneering
AIDS researcher at the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., also a lecturer in surgery at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, took part in the procedure.

The experiment was devised by Dr.  Suzanne Ildstadt, Chief, Division of
Cellular Therapeutics, Pittsburgh University School of Medicine.  Ildstadt
discovered a novel blood cell, the "facilitating" cell, which eliminates the
risk of graft-versus-host disease, a fatal adverse reaction, and successfully
fights transplant rejection.

Baboons are naturally resistant to HIV-1.  It is therefore believed that the
uninfected baboon bone marrow cells will join the HIV infected human marrow to
restore the patient's immune function.

The applied "facilitating" cell technology may dramatically change the
practice of transplantation in that it could potentially enable permanent
acceptance of transplanted organs such as heart, kidney, lung and liver as
well as transplanted cells or tissue, all without the need for tissue matching
or prolonged administration of immunosuppressive drugs.

The technology could provide effective treatments for blood and autoimmune
diseases, such as:  Leukemia and Lymphoma, Sickle Cell Anemia, Thalassemia,
Systemic Lupus Euythematosis, Crohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes, and may
ultimately permit successful xenotransplantation (cross-species
transplantation).

Positive Patients."  P.M.  Boiselle, I.  Tocino, R.J.  Hooley, A.S.

Pumerantz, P.A.  Selwyn and V.P.  Neklesa, et al.  New Haven, Connecticut.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  To assess the accuracy of
chest radiographic interpretation in the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia (BP), and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in
HIV-positive patients and to identify the frequency with which these
infections mimic each other radiographically.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The
admitting chest radiographs of 153 HIV-positive patients with laboratory
proved BP (n=71), PCP (n=73) and pulmonary TB (n=9) and those of 10 HIV
positive patients with no active disease were reviewed retrospectively and
independently by 3 radiologists.  Readers were blinded to clinical
presentation, CD4 count, original radiographic interpretation, and final
diagnosis.  For each case, the radiologists listed a single diagnosis followed
by an assessment of degree of confidence.  RESULTS:  A confident diagnosis was
made in 136 of 163 cases (83.4%).  By specific diagnostic category, the median
accuracies are as follows:  pulmonary TB, 85%; PCP, 75%; BP, 64%; and no
active disease, 100%.  Correcting for random agreement, there was moderate
interobserver agreement.  Fifteen of 153 cases (9.8%) mimicked other
infections radiographically and were given the same inaccurate diagnosis by
all 3 independent observers.  CONCLUSION:  Chest radiographic interpretation
allows a confident and accurate diagnosis to be made in the majority of HIV
positive patients with PCP, BP, and TB at the time of hospitalization.  In
approximately 10% of cases, these infections may mimic each other
radiographically."

December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  Tuberculosis (TB) in AIDS
patients has a more aggressive and different pathologic picture than it does
in non-AIDS patients; this fact influences the methods of diagnosis and
treatment.  Gallium studies have been recommended in the work-up of these
patients.  The purpose of this study was to review the gallium scans in all
AIDS patients with a proved diagnosis of TB to find the sites of involvement
and causes of false negative gallium scanning and to provide correlation with
chest x-ray findings.  CONCLUSION:  Lymph node involvement with TB infection
in AIDS patients is more common than parenchymal lung involvement.  The
mediastinal and supraclavicular areas were involved most often, followed by
the axillary, upper abdominal and inguinal regions.  Anti-TB treatment affects
the sensitivity of gallium scanning in AIDS patients with TB."

with Normal ALT."  M.  Diago, P.  Carbonell, C.  Gonzalez, R.  Zapater, R.
Cors, P.  Rivera, C.  Tuset and J.  Villalba.  Hepatology and Immunology

Sections, Hospital General University, Valencia, Spain.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "The aim is to determine the clinical and
histological findings in patients with anti HCV RIBA 2 indeterminate and
normal ALT.  We studied 81 patients (39 men and 42 women, age 41.1, range
19-64).  In each patient, the clinical and epidemiological data were
collected.  Liver function test, anti HIV, markers of hepatitis B, RNA-VHC (by
PCR), anti HCV RIBA 3 and liver biopsy were performed in all the patients.  We
compared histological findings according to the results of PCR-VHC (+/-), the
antibody band positive in RIBA 2 and the RIBA 3 results (+/-/indeterminate).
RESULTS:  Previous transfusion was present in 18.5% (15/81) and without
parenteral antecedents in 72.8% (59/81).  ALT levels were persistently normal
in all patients, and they were HIV and HBsAg negative.  Previous HBV infection
was detected in 22.8%.  Histological diagnoses were:  Chronic hepatitis (CAH
or CPH) in 49% (40/81), Fatty liver in 8.6%(7/81), Minimal changes in 31%
(25/81) and normal liver in 11% (9/81).  RNA-VHC (PCR) was positive in 8
patients:  2 CPH, 3 CAH, 3 MC.  Histological diagnoses in the 73 PCR negative
patients were 27 CPH (37%), 7CAH (9.6%), 7 FL (9.6%), 1 CH (1.3%), 22 MC (30%)
and 9 normal liver (12.3%).  The RIBA 3 was positive in 10% of RIBA 2 positive
patients, negative in 10% and indeterminate in 80%.  CONCLUSIONS:  Only 27% of
RIBA 2 indeterminate patients had a parenteral risk of HCV acquisition.  Half
of the patients with RIBA 2 indeterminate had chronic hepatitis and only 8.6%
had a normal liver.  RNA (by PCR) was detected in 10%.  There is no
relationship between the band of RIBA 2 indeterminate and the severity of
liver disease.  Eighty per cent of RIBA 2 indeterminate patients were RIBA 3
indeterminate."

Immunology (TB)
"Regulation of the Human Cellular Immune Response in Tuberculosis."  J.J.
Ellner.  Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Pulmonary tuberculosis is characterized by activation of local and systemic
immune and inflammatory cells and mediators.  Somewhat paradoxically, delayed
type hypersensitivity responses to tuberculin purified protein derivative, and
in vitro correlates frequently are depressed in patients with tuberculosis.
Cross-modulatory cytokines, produced by mononuclear phagocytes, chiefly
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-(beta)), deactivate effector function,
depress T-cell activation and may account for depressed delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH) and increased antibody levels.  Ingestion of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis by mononuclear phagocytes stimulates expression of
cytokines.  Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-(alpha)) and TGF-(beta) function
in autocrine circuits producing activating and deactivating signals,
respectively, for macrophage effector function.  Lipoarabinomannen (LAM) from
virulent M.  tuberculosis selectively induces expression of TFG-(beta)
relative to TFG-(alpha) by monocytes.  In patients with tuberculosis,
TFG-(beta) is expressed in granulomas, and blood monocytes show increased
spontaneous and tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated
production of this cytokine.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to TFG-(beta)
reverses depressed PPD-stimulated blastogenesis and interferon-gamma
expression.  Therefore, TFG-(beta) seems a key mediator of immunosuppression
and energy.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to interleukin-10 partly restores
PPD-stimulated blastogenesis.  Parallel with depressed T-cell responses,
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis show increased levels of IgM, IgG, IgG-1,
and IgE antibodies directed against M.  tuberculosis.  This finding too may
reflect cross-regulation by TFG-(beta).  Current understanding of
immunoregulation in tuberculosis provides some clear directions for
immunotherapy.  In dually-infected persons, activation of CD4 lymphocytes and
monocytes by tuberculosis might promote replication of HIV-1.  In fact, serum
and cell-derived TNF-(alpha) are increased in HIV infected tuberculosis
patients and this cytokine is known to stimulate HIV replication.  Further,
monocytes from patients with tuberculosis show increased infectability by HIV;
and PPD and M.  tuberculosis stimulate HIV replication in latently infected
macrophages.  Therefore, M.  tuberculosis and HIV infections may be mutually
enhancing.  The human immune response can be used to identify candidates for a
subunit vaccine.  Increasing evidence supports a primary role for
extracellular products of M.  tuberculosis as a target of protective immunity.
Epitope mapping of the secreted 30 kD alpha-antigen indicates immunodominance
of certain peptides that could provide the basis for an improved vaccine or
DTH skin test."

Infection Control (TB)
"Behavioral Factors in Tuberculosis Control."  E.  Sumartojo.  Division of
Tuberculosis Elimination, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, Georgia.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Tuberculosis control is directed towards ensuring that patients complete
treatment without infecting others.  Relevant Behavioral and social factors
concern the decisions and actions of individuals who influence treatment
outcomes, including persons at risk for disease, tuberculosis patients, and
health care providers.  Relevant issues include health education for patients
and for the public, provider knowledge and practice, the unique needs of HIV
infected persons and others at high risk of tuberculosis, and the quality of
treatment and control services.  Poor medication adherence remains the core
Behavioral problem in tuberculosis control.  Supervised or directly observed
therapy (DOT) is a currently accepted solution but it is not a panacea; where
successful, it is part of an array of other services.  Continuing social and
Behavioral research describes factors associated with adherence.  Ethnographic
research has addressed the knowledge and beliefs of individuals about
tuberculosis.  Findings are that individuals from various cultures associate
tuberculosis with stigmatization and rejection, have concerns about the
appropriateness and quality of health care, and are often misinformed about
the cause and treatment of the disease.  Studies of interventions show the
effectiveness of community health workers, family and community support, and
comprehensive services that include strong case management, efficient clinic
practices, and additional social or health services for patients.  Research is
emerging on communication strategies used by providers as they talk to
patients, and the impact of poor communication on patient behavior.  Studies
of treatment practices show that some physicians use inadequate regimens, with
implications for the education and supervision of physicians who treat
tuberculosis.  In the next few years, research will emphasize development of
locally appropriate and effective treatment services.  Behavioral research
must focus in intervention studies, informed by findings from existing
descriptive research, but also incorporating social and Behavioral theory and
research methods, and epidemiological research methods.  Critical issues will
be identifying the best mix of services for specific regions and types of
patients, improving provider communication strategies and provider practices,

Pathogenesis (HCV)
"Histological Progression of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection in
Untreated Asymptomatic Blood Donors."  M.M.  Ahmed, E.  Elias, K.  O'Donnell,
J.  Shaw, F.  Kennedy, R.F.  Harrison, F.A.  Ala, H.  Atrah and D.J.  Mutimer.

Queen Elizabeth Hospital Liver Unit, and Regional BTS, Edgbaston, Birmingham,
United Kingdom.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 46th Annual Meeting
of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, held November
3-7, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "The natural history of chronic HCV is poorly
understood.  We prospectively monitored the histological progression of
chronic HCV infection in untreated asymptomatic patients using serial two
yearly liver biopsies.  PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Sixty five asymptomatic HCV
RIBA positive blood donors (48 male, 17 female, median age 37 years) referred
from the Blood Transfusion Service were investigated.  Forty had an overt
parenteral risk factor for HCV exposure - 36 IVDU, 4 prior transfusion.  All
were HCV RNA+ve.  Seventeen patients (26%) had normal initial transaminases.
Median ALT was 48iu (range 9-440, normal <30), AST 48iu (range 14-200, normal
30iu).  Liver biopsy was recommended for all patients, and histology was
scored (without reference to clinical details) according to a modified Knodell
histological activity index (HAI, maximum possible score 13).  63 patients had
an initial biopsy:  median HAI=2, mean HAI=2.8, range 08, none cirrhotic.
When HAI>=6 (9 patients), treatment with alpha interferon was recommended.
When HAI<6 (54 patients), interferon was not used but 2 yearly follow-up
biopsies were recommended.  To date, 29 biopsies have been repeated in
untreated patients - 16 deteriorated, 4 improved, 9 unchanged.  In re-biopsied
patients median HAI increased from 2 to 3.  Serum HCV RNA titre was not
related to progression.  The median ALT at 2 years was unchanged in untreated
patients.  CONCLUSIONS:  In asymptomatic RIBA+ve patients initial histological
changes are mild.  In many patients there is a slow histological progression
over 2 years."

Callitrichid Hepatitis
Montali, R.J.; Connolly, B.M.; Armstrong, D.L.; Scanga, C.A.; Holmes, K.V.
"Pathology and Immunohistochemistry of Callitrichid Hepatitis, an Emerging
Disease of Captive New World Primates Caused by Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis

Virus."  American Journal of Pathology, November 1995;147(5):1441-1449.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Pathology, "Callitrichid hepatitis is an arenavirus infection that recently
emerged as a highly fatal disease of New World primates in the Callitrichidae
family.  As we previously reported, these primates develop hepatitis after
contact with mice that are infected with variants of LCMV (LCMV(CH)), recently
determined to have 86% identity with GC-P gene of the Armstrong and Western
strains of LCMV.  Here, we describe the histopathological lesions and tissue
localization of viral antigens in confirmed cases of callitrichid hepatitis
from recent outbreaks in two U.S.  zoos.  The liver in marmosets and tamarins
with fatal infections consistently showed degeneration, necrosis, and
inflammation, with variable involvement of the spleen, lymph nodes, adrenal
glands, intestine, pancreas, and central nervous system.  Lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus antigens were identified immunohistochemically in
necrotic foci in these organs as well as in nondegenerating areas in lungs,
kidneys, urinary bladder, brain, and testes.  The multi-organ tropism and
histological pattern of LCMV infection in marmosets and tamarins are similar
to those reported for the highly virulent arenavirus that causes lassa fever
in humans.  Comparative studies of callitrichid hepatitis and Lassa fever
would therefore be mutually beneficial for human and nonhuman primate
medicine."  The corresponding author for this study is:  RJ Montali,

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy, "The incidence of bacterial species and their
susceptibilities to ceftriaxone and other beta-lactams from patients with
community-acquired infections were evaluated in a multicenter study over a
4-month period.  A total of 5,768 bacterial isolates were classified according
to whether the patient had been previously hospitalized or had received
antibiotic treatment.  The most relevant findings were the presence of 33.8%
penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 25%
beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae isolates, and 36.4%
amoxicillin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates.  All of these bacteria were
fully susceptible to ceftriaxone.  Nosocomial multiply-resistant bacteria, and
particularly methicillin-resistant S.  aureus, were found, as expected, at a
higher frequency among previously hospitalized patients.  However, such
bacteria may be present in the community; their incidence is high in
particular clinical settings, and such bacteria should be considered when one
is choosing a first-line therapy for the treatment of severe infections."  The

Nosocomial (Catheter Colonization)
Raad, I.; Darouiche, R.; Hachem, R.; Sacilowski, M.; Bodey, G.P.  "Antibiotics
and Prevention of Microbial Colonization of Catheters."  Antimicrobial Agents
and Chemotherapy, November 1995;39(11):2397-2400.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy, "Slime-producing staphylococci frequently colonize
catheters, and when they are embedded in biofilm, they become resistant to
various antibiotics.  In the study that is described, the comparative
efficacies of vancomycin, clindamycin, novobiocin, and minocycline, alone or
in combination with rifampin, were tested in an in vitro model of
colonization.  The model consisted of the modified Robbins device with
antibiotic-impregnated cement filling the lumen of catheter segments.  The
synergistic combination of minocycline and rifampin was the most efficacious
in preventing bacterial colonization of slime-producing strains of
Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus to catheter surfaces.  A
similar trend was observed when the inhibitory activities of polyurethane
catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin were compared with the
inhibitory activities of catheters coated with other antimicrobial agents.
The inhibitory activities of catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin
against S.  epidermidis, S.  aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis strains, for
example, were significantly better than those of catheters coated with
vancomycin (P<0.05).  The inhibitory activities of catheters coated with
minocycline and rifampin against gram-negative bacilli and Candida albicans
were comparable to those of catheters coated with ceftazidime and amphotericin
B, respectively.  We found that the combination of minocycline and rifampin is
unique and highly effective in preventing the colonization of catheters with
slime-producing staphylococci and that it also displays a broad-spectrum
inhibitory activity against gram-negative bacteria and yeast cells."  The

Nosocomial (Infectious Diarrhea)
Porco, F.V.; Visconte, E.B.  "Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a Cause of Infectious
Diarrhea Successfully Treated with Oral Ciprofloxacin."  Annals of
Pharmacotherapy, November 1995;29(11):1122-1123.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Annals of
Pharmacotherapy, "OBJECTIVE:  To describe an immunocompromised patient
(without AIDS) with nosocomial infectious diarrhea caused by Pseudomonas
aeruginosa.  Oral ciprofloxacin therapy proved to be effective.  CASE SUMMARY:
An 80-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension developed
progressive renal insufficiency, was hospitalized because of uremia, and
underwent hemodialysis.  When the patient developed hematochezia, Duke's C
sigmoid colon cancer was detected and successfully resected.  She received
broad-spectrum antibiotics in the perioperative period.  The patient then
developed profuse diarrhea associated with abdominal cramping, a low-grade
fever, prostration, and headache.  The patient then started to receive
vancomycin 500 mg po qid empirically.  Four days later, the diarrhea continued
unabated, the Clostridium difficile titer was negative, and the vancomycin
therapy was stopped.  However, the stool culture was positive for heavy growth
of P.  aeruginosa sensitive to ciprofloxacin.  The patient then began to
receive ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid.  Within 3 days the diarrhea stopped.
Oral ciprofloxacin therapy was continued for 10 days and the patient remained
free of symptoms with formed stools thereafter.  DISCUSSION:  Diarrhea
following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics implicates pseudomembranous
colitis as the cause.  The patient did not respond to oral vancomycin therapy
and had a negative stool assay for C.  difficile toxin.  This patient was
believed to have Pseudomonas enteritis, which was confirmed by 2 positive
stool cultures.  The administration of oral ciprofloxacin therapy stopped her
diarrhea with a rapid resolution of symptoms.  CONCLUSIONS:  P.  aeruginosa as
a cause of infectious diarrhea is unusual.  When it occurs, it usually
represents a nosocomial infection in an immunocompromised host.  This report
illustrates that oral ciprofloxacin therapy is effective for Pseudomonas
enteritis, with rapid resolution of symptoms."  The corresponding author for

Nosocomial (Pneumonia)

and Moisture Exchangers Every 48 Hours Rather Than 24 Hours Does Not Affect

Their Efficacy and the Incidence of Nosocomial Pneumonia."  American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November 1995;152(5):1562-1569.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "Heat and moisture exchangers (HME)
(Dar-Hygrobac II, Peters) can safely be used every 24 h for longterm
mechanical ventilation and provide a cost-saving alternative to heated
humidifiers.  We have prospectively determined whether changing HMEs every 48
h only affects their clinical and bacteriological efficiency in a series of
consecutive nonselected ICU patients requiring long-term mechanical
ventilation.  Two consecutive periods were compared.  During period 1, HMEs
were replaced every day; during period 2, they were changed every 48 h.
Patients from the two periods were similar in terms of age and indication for
and overall duration of MV (10 +/- 8.6 versus 10 +/- 9 d, P=0.9).  Minute
ventilation and maximum values for peak airway pressure were identical during
the two periods.  These values were also identical after 1 and 2 d of HME use
during period 2, indicating that HME resistance was not increased by prolonged
use.  Obstruction of the tracheal tube occurred only once in a period 1
patient.  The results of quantitative cultures indicate that the maximum and
mean levels of bacterial colonization during the two periods were similar for
the pharynx, trachea, Y-connector, patient, and ventilator side of the HM 8.
More importantly, the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia was similar during the
two periods (6/61 versus 8/68, P=0.7).  Thus, prolonged HME use is safe and
provides a substantial reduction in the cost of mechanical ventilation."  The

Universal Infant Hepatitis B Vaccination Recommendations."  Pediatrics,
November 1995;96(5 Part 1):875-879.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Pediatrics,
"OBJECTIVE:  To assess the extent to which hospitals in a midwestern state
with low acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) morbidity offered hepatitis B (Hep B)
vaccine to all infants, whether offering infants Hep B vaccine was associated
with hospital geographic location or size, as measured by the number of
births, and how hospital staff resolved key programmatic issues.  METHODS:
The managers of hospital newborn nurseries (n=110) were surveyed by mail.  The
written response rate was 72%; all of the nonresponders were interviewed by
telephone.  The outcome measured was the number of hospitals offering Hep B
vaccine to all infants by geographic region and hospital size.  RESULTS:
Sixty-five percent of the hospitals routinely offered Hep B vaccine to all
infants; these hospitals accounted far 80% of reported Wisconsin births.  In
univariate analysis, the decision to offer infants Hep B vaccine was
associated with both hospital size and hospital location.  After controlling
for size, hospitals in the northeastern region were eight times more likely
(relative risk, 8.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.30, 51.79) to offer infants
Hep B vaccine than hospitals in the southeastern (referent) region.  Regional
differences in reported rates of acute HBV infection do not explain this
finding, because morbidity in the northeastern region (1 per 100,000) is among
the lowest in Wisconsin.  Although more than 80% of hospitals with Hep B
vaccination programs required written informed consent for vaccination, had
standing orders for administering Hep B vaccine to infants whose mothers'
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test results were known, and had
mechanisms to notify the infants' physicians that the infants had been
vaccinated, only 38% had standing orders for testing mothers whose HBsAg test
results were unknown.  CONCLUSIONS:  Hospitals are not necessarily deterred
from implementing infant Hep B vaccination programs by low community HBV
morbidity.  Hospitals should develop policies to assure that parturient women
with unknown HBsAg status are screened and their infants are appropriately
treated."  The corresponding author for this study is:  MB Hurie, Wisconsin

Pneumocystis carinii

Critically III Patients with Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia."  American
Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November
1995;152(5):1435-1442.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "The objective of the present study
was to assess the association between type of health insurance coverage and
use of diagnostic tests and therapies among patients with AIDS-related
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).  Fifty-six private, public, and
community hospitals in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Miami were selected for the
study, and the charts of 890 patients with empirically treated or
cytologically confirmed PCP, hospitalized during 1987 to 1990 were
retrospectively reviewed.  Patients were classified by insurance status:
self-pay (n=56), Medicaid (n=254), or private insurance, including health
maintenance organizations and Medicare (n=580).  Primary outcomes were the use
and timing of bronchoscopy, the type and timing of PCP therapy, and
in-hospital mortality.  The results indicate that Medicaid patients were less
likely than privately insured patients to undergo bronchoscopy (relative odds
= 0.61; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.93; P=0.02) or to have their diagnosis of PCP
confirmed (relative odds = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.33, 0.77), after adjusting for
patient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.  Medicaid patients
were approximately three-fourths more likely than privately insured patients
(relative odds = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.96; P=0.04) to die in-hospital, after
adjusting for patient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.
However, with further adjustment for confirmation of PCP, Medicaid patients no
longer had a significantly higher likelihood of dying in-hospital.  We
conclude that Medicaid patients are less likely to receive diagnostic
bronchoscopy than privately insured or self-insured patients, more likely to
be empirically treated for PCP, and more likely to die in-hospital.  Higher
mortality among Medicaid patients may result from failure to diagnose and
treat alternative pathogens, a consequence of worse access to invasive
diagnostic tests."  The corresponding author for this study is:  CL Bennett,

Varicella-Zoster Virus
Perry, C.M.; Bryson, H.M.  "Oka/Merck Varicella Vaccine:  A Review of Its
Immunogenicity and Protective Efficacy Against Varicella."  Clinical
Immunotherapeutics, November 1995;4(5):396-416.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Clinical
Immunotherapeutics, "Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine
produced from the Oka strain of the herpesvirus varicella zoster virus (VZV).
The Oka strain of VZV is recognized as having low virulence while eliciting
humoral and cell-mediated responses to VZV.  In numerous studies, Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine achieved a seroconversion rate of >95% in healthy children
and adolescents.  In immunocompromised children with leukaemia in remission,
seroconversion was achieved in 80% of vaccinees 12 months after vaccination.
Cell-mediated immune responses generally closely paralleled humoral immune
responses.  The vaccine is also immunogenic in healthy adults.  In healthy
children, a high level of protection was conferred by Oka/Merck varicella
vaccine, and in the only double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted to
date the vaccine was 98% effective in protecting healthy children against
varicella during 2 varicella seasons.  In children with leukaemia, Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine was 80% effective in protecting against mild varicella and
conferred 100% protection against moderate and severe varicella.  In healthy
adults, the rate of protection against varicella was reported to be
approximately 50%.  All observed cases of varicella in healthy and
immunocompromised vaccinees were mild and there were no reports of ay
disease-related complications.  Interestingly in children and adolescents with
leukaemia, the incidence of herpes tester was lower in children who received
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine than in similar children who had natural immunity.
Mild varicelliform rash (occasionally accompanied by fever) has been observed
in healthy children, adolescents and adults who have received Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine.  Pain at the injection site was the adverse effect most
frequently reported in one large study of the vaccine in healthy children.  In
children with leukaemia, vaccine-associated rash has been reported in up to
50% of vaccinees.  When Oka/Merck varicella vaccine was administered to
healthy children in combination with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine there
was no increase in the incidence of skin rashes compared with that caused by
measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in combination with placebo.  Thus,
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a highly immunogenic vaccine that confers a
high level of protection against typical varicella in healthy children and
adolescents, and in children and adolescents with leukaemia.  While results of
further long term studies investigating the persistence of protective immunity
against varicella are awaited with interest, available darn indicate that
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a major advance in the prevention of this
common and highly infectious disease."  The corresponding author for this

North Carolina
AZOLE RESISTANCE COMMON IN AIDS PATIENTS

    Azole resistance of oropharyngeal yeasts is a common
problem in patients infected with human immunodeficiency
virus type 1, and this resistance has clinical relevance,
according to a study from North Carolina's Duke
University Medical Center.
    Candida species, particularly Candida albicans, are
important opportunistic pathogens in patients with HIV-1
infection.  Infections can range from relatively mild
oropharyngeal or vulvovaginal candidiasis to severe
debilitating mucocutaneous candidiasis including Candida
esophagitis.
    "In our institution, during the past two years
Candida esophagitis has been the AIDS-defining illness in
7 percent of patients with HIV-1 infection," Miram L.
Cameron and colleagues wrote in the article, "Correlation
of In Vitro Fluconazole Resistance of Candida Isolates in
Relation to Therapy and Symptoms of Individuals
Seropositive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1,"
published in the November 1993 issue of Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy.
    "Fluconazole is used frequently for treatment and
prophylaxis of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis.
Recently we noted several patients who developed severe
oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis while receiving
azole therapy.  This finding prompted us to look for in
vitro evidence of azole, specifically fluconazole,
resistance."
    Yeast strains isolated from the oropharynx of 87
consecutive patients infected with HIV were examined for
in vitro susceptibility to fluconazole.  Candida albicans
was isolated from 73 patients.
    Fifty-one of the patients had received antifungal
therapy in the month preceding their yeast infection.
Thirty-two patients had symptomatic oropharyngeal
candidiasis.
    The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were
correlated with azole use and with clinical symptoms and
signs.
    "Although there is overlap between groups, in vitro
testing identified a large group of patients for whose
yeast isolates the fluconazole MICs were high and who
remained symptomatic while receiving azole therapy,"
Cameron et al. wrote.
    "In vitro susceptibility to fluconazole appears to
correlate with clinical resistance.  Although there is
overlap between the groups in the study, the trend is
apparent, and it is likely that in vitro testing will
become a clinical tool in the management of these yeast
infections."
    Cameron et al. call for further studies, with more
patients from other institutions, to confirm their
findings.
    "There are related questions to be answered," they
noted.  "First, does azole and/or polyene therapy select
for changes in the mucosal mycoflora, such as for the
inherently resistant organisms C. krusei and T. glabrata?
Second, does azole therapy induce the development of
azole and/or polyene resistance in the mycoflora present
during its use, or is azole therapy even necessary for
resistant C. albicans to be present?
    "Finally, what is the effect of drug dosage and
length of exposure to azoles in the development of
clinical resistance?  It is essential to answer these
questions correctly to establish clinically useful in
vitro susceptibility testing for fungi and to help design
appropriate strategies for antifungal therapy and
prophylaxis."

Sweden
MECHANISTIC HETEROGENEITY RESPONSIBLE FOR DRUG
SENSITIVITY

    There appears to be a marked mechanistic
heterogeneity responsible for cytotoxic drug sensitivity
in cells with a common histologic origin exposed to the
same drug, according to a report from Uppsala, Sweden.
    In the article, "Characterization of Four Doxorubicin
Adapted Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines with Respect to
Chemotherapeutic Drug Sensitivity, Drug Resistance
Associated Membrane Proteins and Glutathione
Transferases," published in the September-October 1993
issue of Anticancer Research, researcher M. Delatorre and
colleagues examined resistance to doxorubicin.
    Four human breast cancer cell lines with or without
estrogen and progesterone receptors were adapted to
growth in the continuous presence of doxorubicin at 10
(Zr-75-1), 15 (HTB-122), or 50 (MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T)
ng/ml.  The sublines of Zr-75-1, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T
showed 5-10-fold doxorubicin resistance and also cross
-resistance to vincristine (VCR) and etoposide (VP16).
    "The sublines maintained or slightly increased their
cisplatin sensitivity," the researchers wrote.  "The
sublines of HTB-122 showed resistance only to VP16
combined with a paradoxorubicinical increased sensitivity
to VCR.  The phenotypic alteration in the sublines with
respect to doxorubicin sensitivity was maintained for at
least two months in the absence of doxorubicin."
    The glutathione depletor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)
and the calcium channel blocker verapamil (Ver) increased
the doxorubicin sensitivity slightly only in the MDA-MB
-231 and Hs578T sublines, respectively.  Ver also tended
to protect some of the sublines from cisplatin.
    The sublines of Zr-75-1 and Hs578T showed increased
expression of the 170-kDa permeability glycoprotein (P
-gp), whereas expression of a 85-kDa membrane protein
determined by the MRK20 antibody was increased in the
sublines of Zr-75-1, and HTB-122.
    Class pi glutathione transferase (GST) levels varied
greatly between the cell lines but increased during
doxorubicin selection only in the subline of Zr-75-1.
Class mu GST was detectable in the MDA-MB-231, Hs578T and
HTB-122 cell lines, whereas class alpha GST was
detectable in these sublines but undetectable in their
parental cell lines.  The Zr-75-1 subline showed a 5-fold
increase in the class alpha concentration.
    "Except for a correlation between increased P-gp
expression and resistance to doxorubicin, VCR and VP16,
no obvious correlations between receptor status,
increased P-gp expression, membrane proteins, GST levels
and acquired drug resistance were found," Delatorre et
al. wrote.
    "Thus, except for a possible role for P-gp in
multidrug-resistance, these findings indicate a
pronounced mechanistic heterogeneity responsible for
cytotoxic drug sensitivity also in cells with a common
histologic origin and exposed to the same drug."

OVEREXPRESSION OF MDR-PROTEIN PRESENT IN RESISTANT LUNG
CANCER CELL LINE

    The overexpression of multidrug resistance-associated
protein is accompanied by increase in both K(+) channel
and volume-regulated C1(-) channel current in the
multidrug-resistant small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell
line H69AR.
    "The coexistence of markedly elevated K(+) and C1(-)
channels in the H69AR cells suggests that solute export
from these cells may differ significantly from the
parental and revertant cell lines," researcher J. Jirsch
and colleagues wrote in the article, "Inwardly Rectifying
K+ Channels and Volume-Regulated Anion Channels in
Multidrug-resistant Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells,"
published in the September 15, 1993, issue of Cancer
Research.
    "Experiments are in progress to determine whether
modulation of the activity of these channels has any
bearing on the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs in multidrug
-resistant cells which overexpress multidrug resistance
-associated protein (MRP)."
    The multidrug-resistant SCLC cell line H69AR was
derived from its parental cell line, H69 by stepwise
selection in doxorubicin.  H69AR cells display a drug
cross-resistance pattern very similar to that of cells
overexpressing P-glycoprotein, but levels of P
-glycoprotein in H69AR cells are extremely low and
comparable with those found in parental H69 cells.
    "Multidrug resistance in H69AR cells has recently
been shown to be correlated with approximately a 100-fold
increase in the levels of mRNA encoding a novel member of
the ATP-binding cassette transmembrane transporter
superfamily," Jirsch et al. wrote.  "The physiological
function of this multidrug resistance-associated protein,
MPR, and the mechanism by which it may contribute to drug
resistance are currently unknown."
    Studies of multidrug-resistant H69AR cells which
overexpress the multidrug resistance-associated protein,
compared with drug-sensitive parental H69 cells and
reverant H69Pr cells, revealed an inwardly rectifying
K(+) channel current (conductance, 231 pS/pF) and
increased volume-regulated anion current (limiting
conductance, 2 nS/pF).
    "The anion current was selective for C1(-) ions and
sensitive to 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulfonic
acid (0.1-1 mM) but ATP was not required for initial
current activation even in excised patch experiments,"
Jirsch et al. wrote.
    "K(+) current reversal potential varied 52 mV/10-fold
change in the external K(+) concentration and current was
blocked by BaC1(2) (0.1-1mM).  The results indicate that
overexpression of multidrug resistance-associated protein
is accompanied by increase in both K(+) channel and
volume-regulated C1(-) channel current in the multidrug
-resistant cell line H69AR."

NIFEDIPINE MAY ALTER DRUG RESISTANCE IN MALARIA

    The calcium channel blocker (CCB) nifedipine may be
useful in combination with chloroquine for the treatment
of chloroquine-resistant malaria, but more study is
needed.
    Researchers from Chandigarh, India's Postgraduate
Institute of Medical Education and Research examined the
effect of nifedipine on the course of Plasmodium berghei
infection.
    "Recent reports point to a class of compounds, namely
CCBs, as being able to reverse such chloroquine
resistance by decreasing drug efflux from the cells,"
researcher Anju Kalra and colleagues wrote in the
article, "Altered Course of Plasmodium-berghei Infection
by Nifedipine Treatment," published in the September 1993
issue of APMIS.
    "Circumvention of drug resistance by verapamil and
nifedipine has also been reported in vivo in P.
chalbaudi-infected mice," Kalra et al.. wrote.  "These
workers have shown that calcium antagonists by themselves
do not have any inhibitory effect on the parasite and are
effective only when administered along with chloroquine,
both in chloroquine-sensitive as well as chloroquine
-resistant strains."
    The effect of CCB on the course and severity of
plasmodial infection has not been studied extensively.
    "This is necessary before considering the use of CCB
in combination with chloroquine for chemotherapy or
chemoprophylaxis of chloroquine-resistant malaria," the
researchers wrote.  "Keeping this in view, the present
study was undertaken to investigate different aspects of
the course of P. berghei infection in Swiss Albino mice
following nifedipine treatment."
    The researchers observed that mice receiving a daily
dose of 0.015 mg/kg of nifedipine had significantly
shorter prepatent, patent and survival periods compared
to untreated P. berghei-infected animals (P <0.001).
    "This shows that the calcium channel blockers, in
addition to possessing the property of reversing drug
resistance during combined therapy with chloroquine, may
also alter the pathophysiology of malaria infection,"
they wrote.
    Kalra et al. note that long-term therapy with
nifedipine, as shown in their study, is of interest with
respect to two epidemiological and chemotherapeutic
aspects of malaria.
    "Firstly, even though during short-term treatment of
an acute malaria attack the use of CCB drugs along with
chloroquine may not noticeably alter the host response,
it becomes important if CCB are used in prolonged
prophylactic therapy," they wrote.
    "Secondly, the calcium antagonist drugs are already
being widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular
disorders.  The effect of CCB on the severity and course
of malaria infection in patients on long-term calcium
antagonist drug therapy has not been studied.  Similarly
the long-term effects in patients receiving CCB for
circulatory disorders and chloroquine for malaria
prophylaxis are not known.  If these CCB drugs are to be
used in combination with prophylactic doses of
chloroquine in areas with a high incidence of chloroquine
resistance, their possible action on the general immune
status of the human host must be investigated before
initiating such a chemotherapeutic approach."

CHLOROQUINE-RESISTANCE IN MALARIA PATIENTS MAY BE
OVERCOME

    Studies with agents such as verapamil suggest that it
may be possible to enhance chloroquine sensitivity in
malaria patients, according to a study from the
University of Liverpool.
    Resistance to quinoline containing drugs,
particularly chloroquine (CQ), is a major impediment to
the successful chemotherapy and prophylaxis of malaria.
CQ-resistant parasites fail to accumulate as much drug as
their sensitive counterparts, but the reason for this
phenomenon has not been determined.
    "There are at least two principal forms of drug
resistance in malaria," researchers Patrick Bray and
Stephen Ward wrote in the article, "Malaria Chemotherapy:
Resistance to Quinoline Containing Drugs in Plasmodium
falciparum," published in the October 1, 1993, issue of
FEMS Microbiology Letters.
    "First, resistance to the inhibitors of parasite
folate metabolism, which results from specific single
point mutations of the active site (the dihydrofolate
reductase molecule).  This form of resistance arose soon
after introduction of the antifolate drugs and spread
independently from many different foci.  Second,
resistance to chloroquine, which is thought likely to
involve more than one gene, took much longer to develop
and spread from only two foci.  The chloroquine
resistance mechanism, which forms the basis of this
review, has been intensively investigated and whilst not
fully elucidated, probably involves alterations in drug
transport rather than changes at the site of drug
action."
    Bray et al. suggest that CQ-resistant parasites are
believed to maintain lower intracellular drug levels by
means of an active efflux system, similar to that found
in multidrug resistant cancer cells, despite major
differences in both the genetic and biochemical
manifestations of drug resistance in the two cell types.
    Another theory suggests that CQ-resistance could be
linked to a defective CQ uptake mechanism, possibly an
impaired acidification process in the food vacuole of the
resistant parasite.
    "In our opinion, the rate of chloroquine efflux can
no longer be considered to be a reliable phenotypic
indicator of resistance, although the ability of
verapamil to increase steady-state chloroquine
concentrations (albeit at low extracellular chloroquine
concentrations) was found to be specific to resistant
strains," Bray et al. wrote.
    "We believe that chloroquine resistance cannot be
explained simply in terms of enhanced chloroquine efflux
(although efflux is certainly one of the factors
involved), and further, that the reversal of chloroquine
resistance cannot be explained simply by the global
inhibition of drug efflux."
    Despite the fact that the molecular basis of
chloroquine sensitization is poorly characterized in P.
falciparum, the prospect remains that by careful
selection of chemosensitizer it may be possible to
enhance chloroquine sensitivity in vivo, according to
Bray and Ward.
    "Regrettably, because of the unacceptable
pharmacological properties of known enhancers and their
loss of effect both in vitro and in vivo due to plasma
protein binding, none of the currently identified
enhancers is a suitable candidate," they wrote.
    "Studies which provide an improved understanding of
the resistance mechanism(s) evolved by the parasite could
highlight the sites at which pharmacological intervention
may reverse drug resistance.  Such studies may also
provide information that can be applied to the rational
design and use of future antimalarials, so that drug
resistance is less readily developed by the parasite."

NEW MYELOID CELL LINES USEFUL IN EXAMINING MDR1 GENE

    Two newly identified myeloid cell lines, K051 and
K052, may be useful for investigating the cellular and
molecular events in leukemogenesis and drug resistance,
according to a report from a Japanese research center.
    The two cell lines were established from a patient
with multilineage CD7-positive acute leukemia.  The K051
and K052 lines were taken from the patient's bone-marrow
cells at diagnosis and at relapse, respectively.
    "The K051 cell expressed myeloid-associated antigen
(CD13 and CD33), a platelet-associated antigen (CD41),
and an erythroid antigen (glycophorin A)," researcher
Junko Abo and colleagues reported in the article, "p53
and N-ras Mutations in Two New Leukemia Cell Lines
Established from a Patient with Multilineage CD7-Positive
Acute Leukemia," published in the November 1, 1993, issue
of Blood.
    "The K052 cell expressed myeloid-associated antigens
(CD13, CD14 and CD33), lymphoid markers (CD2, CD5 and
CD7), and HLA-DR," Abo et al. wrote.  "Chromosome
analysis of both cell lines showed a 17p-chromosome."
    Both cell lines were investigated for aberrations of
the p53 gene and the N-ras gene.  A p53 mutation detected
in both cell lines consisted of a C to T substitution in
codon 248.  An N-ras mutation detected only in the K052
cell consisted of a G to C substitution in codon 13.
    Expression of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR1)
was also investigated by the semiquantitative reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  MDR1
mRNA was more highly expressed by the K052 cell than the
K051 cell, being equivalent to that in HEL cells.
    The functional MDR1 protein against vincristine was
also observed, and its function was inhibited by
verapamil and cyclosporin A.
    "The K052 cells were capable of phenotypic or
morphologic differentiation after being incubated with
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-2,
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or 1,25-dihydroxy
-vitamin D3," the researchers reported.  "In contrast,
the K051 cells responded phenotypically to retinoic acid.
    "Thus the K051 and K052 cell lines will be useful for
investigating the cellular and molecular events in
leukemogenesis and differentiation, and the mechanism of
expression of the MDR1 gene."

GST RELATED TO MDR IN CANCER CELL LINES

    Increased glutathione S-transferase (GST) has been
found to be involved in the drug resistance mechanism in
a human cancer cell line, suggesting that GST over
-expression is directly related to drug resistance.
    GST enzymes are often over-expressed in tumor cells
made resistant to cytotoxic drugs, but it has been
unclear whether GST over-expression is directly linked to
the resistance mechanism.
    Researcher Clare J. Wareing and colleagues at a
Scottish research center developed a human lung tumor
cell line resistant to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB)
in an effort to establish whether selection for
resistance with a model GST substrate results in
selection of a cell line with higher GST levels.
    "The GST are represented by several gene families,
termed alpha, mu, pi, theta and microsomal, each of which
detoxify harmful electrophiles by catalyzing their
conjugation with glutathione," Wareing et al. wrote in
the article, "Increased Levels of alpha-Class and pi
-Class GST in Cell Lines Resistant to CDNB," published in
the October 1993 issue of European Journal of
Biochemistry.
    "In addition to the increases in GST in drug
-resistant cell lines, other evidence implicating these
enzymes in resistance includes the findings that GST
catalyze the conjunction of anticancer drugs such as
chlorambucil and melphalan with reduced glutathione, that
alpha class GST genes are amplified in a cell line made
resistant to chlorambucil and that the expression of GST
cDNAs in heterologous systems can lead to drug
resistance."
    Wareing et al. found that the resistant line of CDNB
(CDNBr), although only twofold more resistant to the
compound, exhibited a significant (15-fold) increase in
GST activity compared to the wild-type cell line.
    "Resistance to CDNB was associated with a marked
increase in the level of both alpha-class and pi-class
GST," the researchers wrote.
    "The increased levels of alpha-class and pi-class GST
in the CDNBr cells was not due to either gene
amplification or increased mRNA levels and appears to
involve either altered mRNA utilization or protein
stabilization.  In addition to being resistant to CDNB,
the CDNBr cell line also showed a 2.5-fold resistance to
cumene hydroperoxide but was not cross-resistant to the
anticancer drug chlorambucil."
    "The fact that the CDNB-resistant cell line was
cross-resistant to cumene hydroperoxide is consistent
with the ability of alpha-class GST to reduce organic
hydroperoxides," the researchers wrote.  "However, it was
surprising that the resistant line was sensitive to
chlorambucil.  There is strong evidence from the study of
chlorambucil-resistant cell lines and from gene-transfer
experiments that the GST have the capacity to protect
against the toxic effects of this compound.
    "The reason why no cross-resistance to chlorambucil
was observed in the CDNBr cell line is unclear and
suggests that a number of interacting factors are needed
to generate the drug-resistance phenotype."

MDR ASSOCIATED WITH GLYCOPROTEIN IN AML PATIENTS

    An Italian study of multidrug resistance (MDR) in
acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) patients has confirmed
that in at least two patients blasts previously negative
for the glycoprotein P-170 became P-170 positive after
treatment with low-dose arabinosylcytosine (ARA-C) and
vitamin D(3).
    Researcher Mario Petrini and colleagues report
preliminary results from a pilot study begun in 1986 on
patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia treated for
several months with low-dose ARA-C and vitamin D(3).
During treatment or at the time of relapse, a monoblastic
component was frequently found.  A high percentage of
patients were P-170 positive.
    In the two cases of drug-resistance presented in
detail by Petrini et al. conversion of blasts from P-170
negative before ARA-C/vitamin D(3) treatment to P-170
positive after treatment was significant in failure of
clinical response to the agents.
    "The reported cases raise several issues about the
role of low doses of ARA-C, the monoblastic shift of
leukemias during vitamin D(3) administration, the
development of MDR and a possible therapeutic role of
calcium antagonists," Petrini et al. wrote in the
article, "Vitamin D(3) Administration and Multidrug
Resistance in Acute Nonlymphoblastic Leukemia," published
in the 1993 89(4) issue of Acta Haematologica.
    "The addition of the revertant drug nicardipine to
the previously inactive treatment induced a partial
response.  Thus, previously reported in vitro
observations on the differentiating activity of vitamin
D(3) metabolites, possible induction of multidrug
chemoresistance by differentiating agents and the
revertant activity of Ca(++) antagonist nicardipine
appear to be confirmed in vivo in the reported patients."

PHENOXAZINE MODULATORS MAY HAVE TWO OR MORE MECHANISMS OF
ACTION

    At least part of the activity of some N-substituted
phenoxazine modulators may be mediated through a P
-glycoprotein-independent mechanism, according to a
report from Memphis, Tennessee's St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital.
    In previous studies Julie K. Horton and colleagues
reported the synthesis and partial characterization of 21
N(10)-substituted phenoxazines in reversing resistance to
the Vinca alkaloids.
    "To more fully understand the mechanisms for
modulating multidrug resistance (MDR), we have
synthesized a series of phenoxazine derivatives, based
upon our initial observation that phenoxazine, where the
5-position sulfur of phenothiazine is replaced by an
oxygen atom, was a more effective modulator of Vinca
alkaloid accumulation than was phenothiazine," Horton et
al. wrote in the article, "Pharmacological
Characterization of N-Substituted Phenoxazines Directed
toward Reversing Vinca Alkaloid Resistance in Multidrug
-Resistant Cancer Cells," published in the October 1993
issue of Physiological Reviews.
    The researchers compared the activity of the 21
N(10)-substituted phenoxazines in increasing Vinca
alkaloid accumulation and reversing drug resistance in
two human colon carcinoma cell lines.
    Results demonstrated that N-substituted phenoxazines
increased accumulation of vinblastine and that, within
this series, there was little correlation between the two
cell lines when Vinca alkaloid accumulation was compared
at equal concentrations of modulator.  It was also shown
that N-substituted phenoxazines demonstrated both
quantitative and qualitative differences, compared with
verapamil.  The series included at least two compounds,
10-[3'-[N-bis(hydroxyethyl)amino]propyl]phenoxazine and
10-(N-piperidinoacetyl)phenoxazine, which increase Vinca
alkaloid accumulation but do not significantly inhibit
efflux.
    Several of the MDR modulators significantly enhanced
the accumulation (8-50-fold) of Vinca alkaloids in cell
lines with very low or undetectable P-glycoprotein
levels.
    "The studies presented here suggest that within the
series there are compounds that inhibit efflux
(verapamil-like activity), whereas others markedly
increase Vinca alkaloid accumulation without having
significant detectable inhibitory activity on the efflux
component," Horton et al. wrote.  "Several of the
phenoxazine modulators characterized enhance Vinca
alkaloid accumulation in cell lines where verapamil has
no significant activity.  Data support the concept that
influx of Vinca alkaloids may be enhanced in a P
-glycoprotein-independent manner by several N-substituted
phenoxazines."

JSB-1 NOT PREDICTIVE OF THERAPY RESPONSE IN AML

    The assessment of multidrug resistant (MDR) status by
immunocytochemistry using JSB-1 monoclonal antibody is
not predictive of response to chemotherapy in patients
with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), according to a report
from Great Britain.
    Forty one patients with AML, including 27 at
presentation and 14 relapsed or resistant cases, were
assessed for laboratory evidence of the MDR phenotype by
researcher A.B. Mehta and colleagues from London's Royal
Free Hospital.  The study was reported in the October
1993 issue of Leukemia and Lymphoma.
    Leukemic cells from all 41 cases were studied by
immunocytochemistry using the JSB-1 monoclonal antibody
and simultaneously by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) to evaluate expression of the MDR
1 gene.  Cells from 32 of the 41 cases were also assessed
for daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation and retention by flow
cytometry (FC).
    Nineteen of the 41 (46 percent) patients were
positive for MDR by JSB-1 immunocytochemistry (11 of 27
at presentation and eight of 14 relapsed or resistant
cases).  Nine of the 19 (47 percent) P-gp positive, de
novo patients achieved complete remission.
    Twenty-two patients were negative by JSB-1
immunocytochemistry (16 of 27 at presentation and six of
14 of the relapsed or resistant cases) and 11 of 22 (50
percent) P-gp negative patients achieved a complete
remission.
    Of the 32 patients assessed by FC, seven (22 percent)
were positive for the MDR phenotype with increased DNR
accumulation and retention in the presence of the MDR
reversing agent verapamil (VPM).  Six out of seven of the
FC positive cases were also JSB-1 positive, and six had
additional poor risk features.
    Of the 25 FC negative patients, six had received
previous chemotherapy and 15 (60 percent) achieved
complete remission.  MDR 1 mRNA levels were increased in
all seven FC positive cases whereas only seven of 19 JSB
-1 positive cases had raised MDR 1 mRNA levels.
    "These results suggest that the assessment of MDR
status by immunocytochemistry using JSB-1 is not
predictive of response to chemotherapy," the authors
conclude.
    "Flow cytometric analysis of blast cells appears to
correlate well with MDR 1 mRNA levels and may be a better
predictor of treatment outcome."

PROGESTERONE CRUCIAL TO BINDING OF RHODAMINE 123

    Progesterone appears to act by a non-genomic
mechanism to decease intracellular binding of rhodamine
123, making the dye accessible to the multidrug
resistance (MDR) pump, according to a report from the
Yale University Comprehensive Cancer Center.
    Rhodamine 123 is a mitochondrial dye that is retained
for prolonged periods by carcinoma cells.  In previous
studies it was reported that many transformed epithelial
cell lines and carcinoma-derived cell lines retain the
dye much longer than do normal epithelial cells.
    An important factor that decreases rhodamine 123
retention in cells is the MDR pump.  It has been widely
reported that resistance to cancer chemotherapy may be
caused by a pump that removes drugs from cells, and that
effective substrates for the pump are lipophilic and
cationic.  Compounds with these characteristics, such as
verapamil, directly interact with the pump to inhibit
transport of other substrates.
    "Rhodamine 123 is a good substrate for the pump, as
would be predicted by its structure; retention of this
dye has been suggested to be an assay for the presence of
the MDR pump in resistant cancer cells," researcher Erik
M. Jancis and colleagues wrote in the article, "Rapid
Stimulation of Rhodamine 123 Efflux From Multidrug
-Resistant KB Cells By Progesterone," published in the
November 2, 1993, issue of Biochemical Pharmacology.
    "In the course of analyzing the factors that
contribute to prolonged rhodamine 123 retention in
carcinoma cells, we found that progesterone did not
always inhibit efflux of rhodamine 123 from KB cells
selected for multidrug resistance," the researchers
wrote.
    "While investigating causes of retention of this dye,
we found that 10 uM progesterone caused a rapid
stimulation of efflux of rhodamine 123 within 15 minutes
from KB V20C cells, which overexpress the multidrug
resistance pump."
    Progesterone did not stimulate efflux from KB cells
that do not overexpress the pump, and verapamil blocked
rhodamine 123 efflux in the presence or absence of
progesterone, indicating that rhodamine 123 is removed
from KB V20C cells by the MDR pump.
    "Progesterone, however, is unlikely to stimulate
rhodamine 123 efflux by simply increasing pump activity
for two reasons:  (1) progesterone inhibited the efflux
of daunomycin from KB V20C cells, so it did not stimulate
efflux of all drugs, and (2) progesterone inhibited
efflux of rhodamine 123 from L1210/VMDRC cells and had
little effect on Adr(R) MCF7 cells; both overexpress the
multidrug resistance pump," Jancis et al. reported.
    In the experiments with KB V20C cells, progesterone
was the most active steroid tested.  At 10 uM,
progesterone caused a 70-fold stimulation,
desoxycorticosterone, testosterone, promegestone and
estradiol caused about 20-fold stimulation, and others
had little or no effect.
    "Progesterone may act by a non-genomic mechanism to
decrease intracellular binding of rhodamine 123, making
the dye accessible to the multidrug resistance pump," the
authors concluded.
    "The results of this paper demonstrate that retention
of rhodamine 123 is rapidly changed by factors other than
the simple overall activity of the multidrug resistance
pump and so the interpretation of retention is more
complex that simply reflecting the amount of the
multidrug resistance pump.  Determining how progesterone
influences rhodamine 123 retention will not only lead to
a greater understanding of why this dye is retained so
well by carcinoma cells but also may lead to new
knowledge of progesterone actions."

HEPT-DERIVATIVES ACTIVE AGAINST RESISTANT HIV STRAINS

    1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine
(HEPT) derivatives retain significant activity against
human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) mutant strains that
are resistant to other HIV-1-specific inhibitors,
according to a report from a Belgian research center.
    Several classes of structurally different compounds
have been credited with a highly specific activity
against HIV-1.  These compounds are not inhibitory to any
DNA or RNA viruses other than HIV-1.
    "The HEPT derivatives have not been analyzed for
their resistance to HIV-1 mutant strains that were
selected for resistance to the other classes of HIV-1
-specific inhibitors and contain a well defined amino
acid substitution in their reverse transcriptase (RT)
genome," researcher Jan Balzarini and colleagues wrote in
the article, "HIV-1 Drug-Resistance Patterns with
Different HEPT Derivatives," published in the October
1993 issue of Molecular Pharmacology.
    "Nor has the emergence of drug-resistant virus under
HEPT therapy been investigated.  In the present study, we
found that HEPT derivates in general remain inhibitory to
HIV-1 strains selected for resistance to various other
classes of HIV-1-specific inhibitors."
    The researchers also found that HIV-1 mutant strains
selected for resistance to various other classes of HEPT
derivatives show cross-resistance to virtually all of
other HIV-1-specific inhibitors.  Different HEPT
derivatives were also found to select for different
mutations in the HIV-1 RT gene.
    "When directly selected for resistance to the HEPT
derivates, the HIV-1 mutant strains are resistant not
only to the HEPT derivatives but also to the other HIV-1
-specific RT inhibitors," Balzarini et al. wrote.
    "From a clinical viewpoint, our observations suggest
that the HEPT derivatives may be beneficial in the
treatment of those HIV-1 infections that have become
resistant to other HIV-1-specific inhibitors."

The Netherlands
CISPLATIN-RESISTANT CELL LINE, TERA-CP, IDENTIFIED

    Researchers from the Netherlands describe a
cisplatin-resistant embryonal carcinoma cell line of
teratocarcinoma with the capacity to differentiate in
vitro.
    Teratocarcinoma is the most common form of cancer in
young adult men, consisting of two histological
components, embryonal carcinoma (EC) and teratoma.  EC
cells are the stem cells from which the teratoma
component is derived.  EC is highly malignant with a
tendency to early metastatic spread, but also responds
well to therapy with cisplatin.
    Resistance to cisplatin can be due to reduced drug
accumulation and increased detoxification of drug in the
cellular cytoplasm, but mechanisms of resistance are not
uniform and vary among different cell lines.
    In this study researcher Hetty Timmer-Bosscha and
colleagues describe the Tera-CP subline, which enables
the study of cisplatin-resistance in extremely sensitive
cells and the effect of serial cisplatin incubations on
the EC phenotype of the cells.
    "In the embryonal carcinoma cell line Tera and its
3.7-fold cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin)
-resistant subline, Tera-CP, parameters were studied that
might have changed in relation to induction of cisplatin
resistance," Timmer-Bosscha et al. wrote in the article,
"cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum(II) Resistance In Vitro and
In Vivo in Human Embryonal Carcinoma Cells," published in
the December 1, 1993, issue of Cancer Research.
    "Phenotypes of both lines were embryonal carcinoma.
Karyotypes were related with a decreased mean number of
chromosomes and fewer copies of the short arm of
chromosome 12 in Tera-CP."
    Tera-CP showed cross-resistance for melphalan and 4
-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and had an 1.4-fold
increased glutathione (GSH) level, a 1.5-fold increased
glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, and a 1.4-fold
increased GSTpi expression compared to Tera.
    Tera-CP was cross-resistant to 5-fluorouracil, but
thymidylate synthase activity was not increased.
Topoisomerase I and II activities and c-myc RNA and
protein expression were the same in both lines.
    Platinum accumulation was equal in both lines, and
platinum-DNA binding was lower in Tera-CP than in Tera.
Both cell lines were xenografted into nude mice and
tumors showed marked differentiation.
    Tera-CP tumors were 2.8-fold more resistant to
cisplatin than Tera tumors.  In new cell lines derived
from xenografts of Tera and Tera-CP cisplatin
sensitivity, GST activity and GSH level corresponded with
their sensitivity and resistant origin.
    "Tera-CP is a model of in vitro and in vivo cisplatin
resistance with the GSH/GST detoxifying system as an
important mechanism," the researchers wrote.  "Cisplatin
resistance could be induced without a concomitant
increase in differentiation."

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN P. AERUGINOSA DUE TO ORFC
-DEPENDENT DRUG EFFLUX

    ORFC-dependent drug efflux contributes to multiple
antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
according to a report from Ontario, Canada's Queen's
University.
    P. aeruginosa is a clinically significant pathogen
characterized by intrinsic resistance to a number of
antimicrobial agents.
    Recently researcher Keith Poole and colleagues
identified an operon (ORFABC) in P. aeruginosa apparently
involved in pyoverdine secretion.
    "We report here the characterization of ORFC, which
encodes an outer membrane protein whose overproduction is
associated with multiple antibiotic resistance," Poole et
al. wrote in the article, "Multiple Antibiotic Resistance
in Pseudomonas-aeruginosa - Evidence for Involvement of
an Efflux Operon," published in the November 1993 issue
of Journal of Bacteriology.
    An outer membrane protein of 50 kDa (OprK) was
overproduced in a siderophore-deficient mutant of P.
aeruginosa capable of growth on iron-deficient minimal
medium containing 2,2'-dipyridyl (0.5 mM).
    "The expression of OprK in the mutant (strain K385)
was associated with enhanced resistance to a number of
antimicrobial agents, including ciprofloxacin, nalidixic
acid, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and streptonigrin.
OprK was inducible in the parent strain by growth under
severe iron limitation, as provided, for example, by the
addition of dipyridyl or ZnSO4 to the growth medium,"
Poole et al. wrote.
    "The gene encoding OprK (previously identified as
ORFC) forms part of an operon composed of three genes
(ORFABC) implicated in the secretion of the siderophore
pyoverdine.  Mutants defective in ORFA, ORFB or ORFC
exhibited enhanced susceptibility to tetracycline,
chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, streptonigrin and
dipyridyl, consistent with a role for the ORFABC operon
in multiple antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa."
    Sequence analysis of ORFC revealed that its product
is homologous to a class of outer membrane proteins
involved in export.  Similarly, the products of ORFA and
ORFB exhibit homology to previously described bacterial
export proteins located in the cytoplasmic membrane.
    "These data suggest that ORFA-ORFB-oprK (ORFC)
-dependent drug efflux contributes to multiple antibiotic
resistance in P. aeruginosa," the authors noted.  "We
propose, therefore, the designation mexAB (multiple
efflux) for ORFAB."

TLB EFFICACIOUS IN CISPLATIN-RESISTANCE

    Thaliblastine may be of value in the treatment of
cisplatin-resistant malignancies with hyperthermia,
according to a report from Boston's Harvard University.
    Researcher G. Chen and colleagues examined
thaliblastine (TBL), a natural compound, in a murine
study examining a cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumor cell
line.
    "TBL showed a twofold higher cytotoxicity in a
cisplatin-resistant rat ovarian tumor cell line (0
-342/cisplatin) than in its parental sensitive line (0
-342), as determined by an antiproliferation assay with
24-hour continuous exposure," Chen et al. wrote in the
article, "Collateral Sensitivity to Thaliblastine and/or
Hyperthermia Exhibited by a Rat Ovarian Tumor Cell Line
Selected for Resistance to Cisplatin," published in the
September-October 1993 issue of Anticancer Research.
    This phenomenon was also observed following two-hour
pulse exposure if combined with heat treatment (40deg.C).
Further escalation of the temperature to 43deg.C alone
brought about 74.7 +/- 17.0 percent growth inhibition in
the sensitive and 97.2 +/- 1.8 percent in the resistant
line.
    "Under this condition, the ID50 of TBL was again only
half as much in 0-342/cisplatin cells as in the parental
cells (12 vs 24 mug/ml) when compared to the hyperthermic
treatment alone," Chen et al. wrote.  "In a colony
formation assay with two-hour pulse exposure, the
hypersensitivity of the resistant cells to cisplatin
and/or heat was further confirmed."
    Alkaline elution showed that 24-hour continuous
treatment with TBL induced DNA single-strand breaks (SSB)
in a dose-dependent manner in 0-342/cisplatin cells,
whereas there was almost no DNA-SSB production by TBL in
the sensitive line, possibly in part accounting for the
hypersensitivity of the cisplatin resistant cells to TBL.
    The heat treatment (40deg.C for two hours) induced
single strand breaks in both lines, which was further
enhanced by combination with TBL.
    This damage was repaired in part in 0-342 but almost
completely in 0-342/cisplatin line after cells grew in
drug-free medium for 48 hours following the exposure,
indicating that resistant cells can more efficiently
repair DNA damage by either TBL or hyperthermia.
    "Altogether, these results suggest that TBL may have
the potential to be used clinically as an alternative in
the treatment of cisplatin-resistant malignancies with
hyperthermia," the authors concluded.

PODOPHYLLOTOXIN ANALOGS MAY BE USEFUL IN DR TUMORS

    Podophyllotoxin analogs can overcome resistance to
etoposide and may be of value in the treatment of drug
-resistant (DR) tumors, according to a report from the
University of California, Los Angeles.
    Researcher H. Morimoto and colleagues described two
podophyllotoxin analogs in their article, "Cytotoxic
Activity Against Resistant Human Tumor Cell Lines by Two
Synthetic Demethylpodophyllotoxin Derivatives - A Single
Stereoisomeric Change Prevents Cell Death by Apoptosis,"
published in the December 1993 issue of the International
Journal of Oncology.
    "The present study investigated the cytotoxic
properties of two synthetic podophyllotoxin derivatives
namely 4-o-butanoyl-4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin (BEPT)
and 4-o-butanoyl-4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin (BDPTN or
BN58705)," Morimoto et al. wrote.
    Both BEPT and BDPTN were shown to be cytotoxic
against a battery of human tumor cell lines.
    "In comparison to etoposide, the magnitude of
cytotoxic activity by BEPT and BDPTN was higher," the
researchers wrote.  "Furthermore, both compounds were
cytotoxic to drug resistant lines and also were able to
overcome the etoposide and cross-resistance of an MDR
positive cell line."
    The mechanism of cytotoxicity was also examined.
Like etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and inducer
of apoptosis, BEPT was found to mediate its cytotoxic
activity by an apoptotic pathway.  BDPTN, however, did
not mediate apoptosis.
    "These findings demonstrate that a simple
modification in the stereoisomeric structure results in
significant modification in both the cytotoxic patterns
and the induction of apoptosis," Morimoto et al. wrote.
"Furthermore, the findings show that the podophyllotoxin
analogs can overcome drug resistance and suggest their
possible application in the therapy of resistant tumors."

CEFPIROME EFFECTIVE AGAINST BACTERIA RESISTANT TO OTHER
BETA-LACTAMS

    A report from England finds that cefpirome has a
potential clinical advantage against gram-positive and
gram-negative bacteria resistant to other beta-lactams,
including imipenem.
    Researcher R.C. Spencer and colleagues examined
several beta-lactams in a multicenter in vitro study
involving 8,625 isolates from 13 countries, in an effort
to determine both the current bacterial epidemiology in
intensive care and hematology/oncology units and the
cross-susceptibility of the organisms to cefpirome,
ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and piperacillin.  The
specimens were examined between May and November of 1992.
    "Bacterial species with 20 or more isolates resistant
to one of the six antibiotics were examined for their
susceptibility to the beta-lactams," Spencer et al. wrote
in the article, "Cross-Susceptibility of Cefpirome and
Four Other beta-Lactams Against Isolates from Hematology
Oncology and Intensive Care Units," published in the
Supplement 91, 1993 issue of Scandinavian Journal of
Infectious Diseases.
    Cefpirome and imipenem had the smallest total numbers
of isolates.  Bacteria resistant to ceftazidime or
ceftriaxone were often susceptible (>50 percent) to
cefpirome.  Conversely, cefpirome resistant isolates were
frequently resistant (>90 percent) to ceftazidime and
ceftriaxone.  P. aeruginosa was an exception, exhibiting
cross-resistance to all cephalosporins.
    Beta-lactamase producing Enterobacter, Citrobacter
and Klebsiella spp. were especially resistant to
piperacillin and ceftazidime but not cefpirome or
imipenem.  Two-thirds or more of coagulase-negative
staphylococci resistant to any single agent, including
imipenem, maintained their susceptibility to cefpirome.
    Cross-class resistance was not exhibited by imipenem
and cefpirome against ciprofloxacin resistant isolates
but was more evident for piperacillin, ceftazidime and
ceftriaxone.  Cefpirome was more active than ceftazidime
against bacteria resistant to both piperacillin and
gentamicin, especially coagulase-negative staphylococci
(76 percent versus 6 percent) and Enterobacter spp. (56
percent versus 21 percent).
    Many coagulase-negative staphylococci and
Enterobacter spp. resistant to two or three compounds
(piperacillin, gentamicin, ceftazidime) remained
susceptible to cefpirome (50-89 percent).
    "These results suggest that cefpirome has a potential
clinical advantage against gram-positive and gram
-negative bacteria resistant to other beta-lactams,
including imipenem," Spencer et al. conclude.

VERAPAMIL ENHANCES ACTIVITY OF SLEEPING-SICKNESS DRUGS IN
MICE

    The calcium channel blocker verapamil was shown to
enhance the efficacy of drug response in mice infected
with human sleeping sickness strains of Trypanosoma
brucei brucei, but it showed no effect when given alone.
    Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch
at Galveston found that enhancement by verapamil of the
anti-trypansomal effects of ethidium were reflected in
accelerated clearing of the parasites from the blood, and
by the increased production, in the treatment schedule,
of dyskinetoplastic organisms.
    K. Lemone Yielding and colleagues concomitantly
administered verapamil during treatment for two different
strains of the parasite with the anti-trypanosomiasis
agents ethidium bromide or berenil.  This resulted in
enhancement of the drug effect as shown by increased
formation of dyskinetoplastic organisms, increased rates
of clearing of the parasites from the blood, and by
enhanced survival of infected mice.
    Verapamil treatment was associated with increased
intracellular accumulation of drug, as shown by
fluorescence of cells exposed to ethidium or DAPI, a
fluorescent surrogate for berenil.
    "In keeping with the reported involvement of
verapamil in preventing efflux of drugs from cells,
ethidium bromide accumulation in intact trypanosomes was
monitored by fluorescence in the presence and absence of
verapamil, and was reflected by detectable fluorescence
in treated cells at ethidium concentrations only 1/10 of
those required for detection in the controls," Yielding
et al. wrote in the article, "Effect of Verapamil on
Antitrypanosomal Activity of Drugs in Mice," published in
the October 1993 issue of Acta Tropica.
    "These results suggest that verapamil can enhance
drug accumulation in trypanosomes as it does in drug
resistant cancer cells and in chloroquine-resistant
malaria.  For trypanosomes the data do not permit
assignment of the effect to either efflux or influx,
however.  The findings in the present experiments suggest
that a verapamil sensitive gene product which can
influence drug response is expressed constitutively in
trypanosomes."
    The authors conclude that if, as implied by these
results, parasites express drug-resistance genes
constitutively, "the search for new drug strategies must
include manipulation of these resistance mechanisms in
concert with the application of new antiparasitic
agents."

INHIBITION OF DIGOXIN TRANSPORT IN VERAPAMIL NON
-STEREOSPECIFIC

    The inhibition of digoxin transport by verapamil
appears to be non-stereospecific, according to a report
from a Canadian research center.
    Verapamil, usually given as a racemic mixture,
decreases in vivo and in vitro digoxin renal tubular
secretion, which is suggested to be mediated by P
-glycoprotein, an ATP-dependent multidrug efflux pump.
    "Importantly, the two enantiomers of verapamil have
been reported to similarly inhibit P-glycoprotein
-mediated transport of chemotherapeutic agents,
researcher S. Ito and colleagues wrote in the article,
"The Mechanism of the Verapamil-Digoxin Interaction in
Renal Tubular Cells (LLC-PK1)," published in the Volume
53, Number 24, 1993 issue of Life Sciences.
    "In this study, we examined effects of enantiomers of
verapamil on digoxin transport across an LLC-PK1 cell
monolayer, a model of proximal renal tubular cells," the
researchers wrote.
    "The results indicate that verapamil inhibition of
digoxin transport is non-stereospecific.  Furthermore,
the verapamil-digoxin interaction is not competitive.
The two drugs may not share a common initial step in the
P-glycoprotein-mediated transport."

ORNITHINE DECARBOXYLASE INHIBITION DUE TO ACTIVE-SITE
INHIBITORS

    Inactivation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) by the
inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) can occur
via interaction with either of two separate residues that
form essential parts of the active site.
    "This renders it unlikely that resistant mutants will
arise from changes in the enzyme structure," researcher
C.S. Coleman and colleagues wrote in the article, "Effect
of Mutations at Active Site Residues on the Activity of
Ornithine Decarboxylase and Its Inhibition by Active
Site-Directed Irreversible Inhibitors," published in the
November 25, 1993, issue of the Journal of Biological
Chemistry.
    Mouse ODC and mutant changing residues thought to be
involved at the active site were expressed in Escherichia
coli, purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography
on a pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate-agarose affinity column,
and tested for their kinetic properties and their
inactivation by enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitors.
    "All of the mutant enzymes were expressed at
comparable levels to the wild type protein (2-4 percent
of the total soluble protein), all bound to the affinity
column, and there were only small differences in the
apparent K(m) values for L-ornithine, providing strong
evidence that the mutations did not lead to any gross
changes in the protein structure," Coleman et al. wrote.
    The mutation K69A led to a change in the spectrum of
the enzyme and a 550-fold decrease in the k(cat)/K(m)
(specificity constant) value.
    "These results are consistent with lysine 69 being
the residue that forms a Schiff base with the pyridoxal
5'-phosphate co-factor," the researchers wrote.
"Mutation C70S did not greatly affect the activity
despite its proximity to this lysine but increased the
K(m) about 2-fold.  In contrast, the mutation C360A
greatly reduced the specificity constant (by 26-fold)
despite a 2-fold decrease in the K(m), suggesting that
this cysteine residue is critically involved at the
active site."
    Although cysteine 360 is known to be the major site
of binding of the inhibitor DFMO, the C360A mutant was
still sensitive to inhibition by this drug.  However, the
kinetics of inactivation were altered, the partition
ratio was 10 times greater, and the labeled adduct formed
by reaction with [5-C-14] DFMO was removed from the
protein under some denaturing conditions.  This adduct
was found to occur at lysine 69.
    The K69A mutant was also sensitive to DFMO with a
lower partition ratio than the wild type enzyme.
    "These results indicate that inactivation of ODC by
DFMO can occur via interaction with either of two
separate residues that form essential parts of the active
site." Coleman et al. wrote.
    "In contrast to the results with DFMO, the C360A
mutant ODC was completely resistant to inactivation by
(R,R)-delta-methyl-alpha-acetylenicputrescine and was
much less sensitive than the wild type enzyme to alpha
-monofluoromethyldehydromethylornithine, showing that the
reactive species formed from these inhibitors either
cannot be formed by this mutant or are unable to react
with lysine 69.  Finally, the well known, extreme
reliance of mammalian ODC on the presence of thiol
-reducing agents to maintain activity is probably
explained by the critical role of cysteine 360, since the
C360A mutant was much less sensitive to inactivation by
incubation in the absence of dithiothreitol."

PGP EXPRESSION AND DRUG RESISTANCE INHERENT IN B-CELL CLL

    P-glycoprotein expression and drug resistance are
inherent characteristics of the B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) lymphocyte, according to a
report from an Australian research center.
    The expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which is
associated with multidrug resistance (MDR), was
investigated by researcher R.L. Sparrow and colleagues in
20 B-CLL patients by flow cytometry using two Pgp
-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb).  These mAB's were
MRK-16, which recognizes an extra-cellular epitope, and
JSB-1, which recognizes an intracellular epitope.
    Sixteen (80 percent) patients were positive with MRK
-16 whereas all patients were positive with JSB-1.  The
proportion of Pgp-positive lymphocytes from each patient
sample varied from 2-94 percent for MRK-16 and 20-93
percent for JSB-1.
    "There was no correlation between the level of
positivity and disease stage or treatment history,"
Sparrow et al. wrote in the article, "Common Expression
of the Multidrug Resistance Marker P-glycoprotein in B
-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Correlation with
In Vitro Drug Resistance," published in the November 1993
issue of Leukemia Research.
    In vitro drug resistance to vincristine (VCR) and
doxorubicin (DOX) was determined by the colorimetric MTT
assay.  All patients were resistant to one or both drugs
being consistent with the expression of Pgp.
    No correlation was seen between the level of
resistance and disease stage or drug treatment.
    "We investigated the expression of Pgp in the normal
counterpart of the B-CLL cells, CD5+CD19+ B-lymphocytes,"
Sparrow et al. wrote.  "A minor subpopulation (3 percent)
of CD5+CD19+ lymphocytes isolated from normal controls
expressed Pgp suggesting that these cells may be the
potential precursors to the B-CLL cell.  We conclude that
Pgp expression and drug resistance are inherent
characteristics of the B-CLL lymphocyte."

A Comparative Study of Candida albicans Serotypes A and B
on the Sensitivity to Antifungal Agents Using the Disk
Method and MIC Determination

AUTHORS:  A. Velegraki, N.J. Legakis and O. Marcelou

    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 1st Scientific Meeting of the European Society of
Chemotherapy Infectious Diseases held November 25-27,
1993, in Budapest, Hungary, "Candida albicans isolated
from 108 patients with immunosuppressive regimens and
AIDS were typed into 61 serotypes A and 47 serotypes B.
Synchronous cultures of the isolates were tested for drug
susceptibility with standardized MIC procedures and with
a semisynthetic commercially available kit.  The mean MIC
values of serotype A did not differ significantly from
the drug sensitivities shown on the semisynthetic medium
(P<0.05) to 5-FC (MIC, A:1.76-1.88, B:5.98-6.29),
nystatin (MIC, A:1.48-1.53) and miconazole (MIC, A:0.39
-0.45, B:2.42-2.64).  The mean MIC values to amphotericin
B of all four B serotypes isolated from AIDS patients
were 2 ugml(-1) and two of those had increased mean MIC
values to fluconazole (5.32 ugml(-1)) and were read as
'partially resistant' to the drug on the semisynthetic
medium.  The significance of C. albicans serotype-
-dependent drug susceptibility and the effect of initial
imidazole monotherapy to the in vitro resistance to
amphotericin B, are issues currently addressed by further
studies."

Susceptibility to Antifungal Agents of Cryptococcus
neoformans Isolated from Cerebrospinal Fluid

    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 1st Scientific Meeting of the European Society of

1993, in Budapest, Hungary, "In recent years, fungi and
especially Cryptococcus neoformans (CN) play increasingly
important roles in patients with compromised host
defense.  Systemic fungal infections are sometimes
accompanied by the appearance of resistance to the
antifungal agents most commonly used in clinical
practice.  For this reason we investigated the in vitro
susceptibility of 9 strains of CN isolated from
cerebrospinal fluid:  from patients with AIDS (5), non
-Hodgkin Lymphoma (3) and renal transplantation (1).  The
in vitro susceptibility of yeasts to amphotericin B,
nystatin, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole and 5

disk test (using complex casitone media and semisynthetic
media, Institute Pasteur, Paris), and by agar dilution
method (yeast nitrogen base, ATB Fungus, API).  There
were correlations between results obtained with this two
methods.  The examined strains of CN were susceptible to
polyenes and imidazoles, but one of them was intermediate
susceptible to 5-FC (MIC= 16ug/ml) and 2 of them were
resistant to 5-FC (MIC >128ug/ml)."

Quinolone Resistance

AUTHORS:  U. Hollenstein, Ch. Wenisch, S. Breyer, A.

    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 1st Scientific Meeting of the European Society of
Chemotherapy Infectious Diseases held November 25-27,
1993, in Budapest, Hungary, "In 1980, when the first
advanced spectrum fluorinated 4-quinolones became
available, they were particular effective for treating
gram-negative bacillary infections and some agents were
also active against gram-positive organisms.  However, in
recent years resistant strains of Pseudomonas and other
Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive organisms like
Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and
Streptococcus pneumoniae have evolved.  We examined
routine bacterial samples from 1986 to 1992 for changes
in susceptibility to quinolones.  A loss of
susceptibility in most pathogens was observed.  In 1992
the resistance pattern in Austria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa
5.3 %, Staphylococcus aureus 33.3%, Staphylococcus
epidermidis 36.5%, Enterobacter cloacae 7.1%) resembles
the level of resistance in other countries.  Increased
use in the hospital, outpatient setting and even in
veterinary medicine might contribute to an expanded
inefficacy of quinolones in infections due to gram
-positive cocci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Campylobacter
spp.  A control of quinolone resistance can be achieved
by continuous determination of the current resistance
situation, by limiting their use to infections like
typhoid fever, shigellosis, cholera, gonorrhoea and
urinary tract infections and by optimal dose and length
of treatment."

The E-Test produced MIC results comparable to those of
agar dilution when multiresistant organisms were tested.
It was necessary to add 2% NaCl to the Mueller-Hinton
agar (MHA), when testing oxacillin against staphylococci
and the plates were incubated aerobically at 30deg.C for
24h.  The E-Test is easy, quick to set up, does not
require special equipment and therefore has practical
advantages compared to other MIC methods."

Chloramphenicol (CHL) Treatment of Resistant Enterococcus
faecium Infections

AUTHORS:  C. Hardalo, M. Rigsby, L. Chen, C. Dykewicz, J.
Elmore, S. Nagy-Agren, P. Wetherill, S. Edberg and W.
Hierholzer.  Yale School of Medicine, New Haven,
Connecticut.
    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 31st Annual Meeting of the Infectious Disease Society
of America, held October 16-18, 1993, in New Orleans,
Louisiana, "We describe a series of patients with
resistant E. faecium infections treated with CHL.
Methods:  Cases were patients with isolates of E. faecium
resistant to ampicillin (AMP), vancomycin (VAN),
ciprofloxacin, and imipenem by standard methods.
Results:  18 cases were identified from review of
microbiology records at Yale New Haven Hospital between
7/1/92 and 4/1/93; 17/18 were also high level gentamicin
(GM)-resistant.  Three cases had positive cultures
without evidence of infection.  The other 15 cases
included the following infections:  6 lower urinary tract
(one with bacteremia), 6 line-related bacteremias, 2
peritonitis, 1 wound, 1 CNS, 1 lower respiratory tract.
14 (93%) were nosocomial with median of 22 days between
admission and infection.  9 patients (60%) required
intensive care units during hospitalization.  Antibiotics
received before infection included VAN (10 patients), GM
(10), cephalosporins (12) and other beta-lactams (11).
All isolates were sensitive to CHL (MIC <4 mcg/ml) and 11
patients were treated with CHL:  9 (36%) treated patients
are alive without infection after median follow-up of
28.5 days; 6 died, but in 9 there was sterilization of
cultures on CHL.  One patient who relapsed after initial
treatment is alive on CHL at the end of the observation
period.  Conclusions:  CHL was used to treat resistant E.
faecium infections, however, success was limited by
significant co-morbidity.  In some patients CHL may be
useful for treatment of resistant Enterococcal infections
and susceptibility testing for CHL should be considered."

    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 31st Annual Meeting of the Infectious Disease Society
of America, held October 16-18, 1993, in New Orleans,
Louisiana, "Introduction:  Antiviral drug resistance,
induced by specific pol gene mutations, has been linked
to clinical progression in HIV-infected patients
receiving antiretroviral drug therapy.  Experiments with
HIV constructs suggest that, in some cases, mutations
selected for by one antiretroviral drug may lessen
resistance induced by another antiretroviral drug.  For
instance, a ddI-resistance mutation at codon 74 of the
HIV pol gene has been shown to suppress the effects of an
AZT-resistance mutation at codon 215 of the HIV pol gene.
Method:  We studied drug susceptibilities (using an in
vitro culture assay) and drug-resistance mutations (using
a nested PCR protocol) of HIV strains from pts with 200
-500 CD4 cells/ul, treated for 1 year with either AZT and
ddI (24 pts) or ddI alone (26 pts).  Results:  HIV could
not be cultured from 7.5-12.5 million peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) after 1 year in 10/24 (42%)
combination therapy pts.  Among the 14 culture-positive
pts on combination therapy, 8 (57%) had an IC(90) (uM
ZDV) >/=10-fold higher than the IC(90) of a pre-therapy
isolate.  10/14 (79%) culture-positive combination
therapy pts had a codon 215 mutation in PBMC (3 pts)
and/or plasma (10 pts); in contrast, 10/10 culture
-negative combination therapy pts had a wildtype sequence
at codon 215 in PBMC or plasma (P=0.002).  ddI
susceptibilities of the combination therapy patients and
the ddI monotherapy pts were similar.  However a ddI
-resistance mutation at codon 74 was detected in 13/26
patients on ddI monotherapy as opposed to 2/24 patients
on combination therapy (P=0.004).  Conclusion:  To grow
in the presence of AZT and ddI, HIV strains acquired an
AZT-resistance mutation but lacked a ddI-resistance
mutation.  The drug-resistance mutations selected in the
clinical setting of combination therapy may be explained
by previous in vitro findings."

Relevance of Gentamicin-Mezlocillin Synergy at LGH

AUTHORS:  R.O. Dowd, D. Bryniarski and M.D. Batt.
Lutheran General Hospital, Park Ridge, Illinois.
    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 31st Annual Meeting of the Infectious Disease Society
of America, held October 16-18, 1993, in New Orleans,
Louisiana, "Presently, at Lutheran General Hospital, a
742 bed acute care teaching hospital, the drug
acquisition cost for an average dose of gentamicin is
$1.50; for tobramycin, $13; and for amikacin, $56.  With
800 patient days per month of aminoglycoside therapy
prescribed, the cost implications of routine use of
aminoglycoside antibiotics other than gentamicin would be
significant.  At many hospitals, antibiotic choice is
based on 'worst case scenarios' for presumed
microbiologic etiology of clinical syndromes, and part of
the decision equation is the antibiogram, which
summarizes the antibiotic susceptibility data from the
most recent available time period.  Based on data from
our Vitek system, only 73% of Pseudomonas isolates were
susceptible to gentamicin, whereas 98% were susceptible
to tobramycin (We do not routinely print out amikacin
susceptibility.)  Because of concern, that in the unknown
clinical setting, there could be a Pseudomonas bacteremia
that would not be successfully treatable if the
antibiotic program recommended were ineffective 27% of
the time, we asked our epidemiology laboratory to look at
the 'resistant' Pseudomonas isolates more closely.  We
found that 84% of 'gentamicin resistant' isolates, in the
presence of mezlocillin showed synergy with gentamicin
mics of 2ug or less.  Since we always advise the usage of
2 drug therapy for treatment of non-urinary potential
Pseudomonas infections, we were able to recalculate the
antibiotic profile to 95% gentamicin susceptible in the
presence of mezlocillin.  The actual number of
Pseudomonas isolates identified each month averaged 32,
representing 1 isolate for every 25 patient days of
aminoglycoside therapy.  Based on these observations, we
have continued to include gentamicin as part of our
treatment of choice in our guidelines for empiric
antibiotic therapy."

Penicillin Resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae
Strains:  Analysis and Implications

AUTHORS:  A.Z. Hakim, L.M. Alba-Sedutto and E.D.
Sinaguinan.  Maimonides Hospital, Brooklyn, New York.
    According to an abstract presented by the authors to
the 31st Annual Meeting of the Infectious Disease Society
of America, held October 16-18, 1993, in New Orleans,
Louisiana, "Prevalence of penicillin-resistant S.
pneumoniae (PR-PS) in the US has been low (5%) compared
to certain parts of the world (30-70%).  In 1991, 100
isolates at our institution were tested for
susceptibility to penicillin by standard disc diffusion
(DD) method.  PR was reported if a zone size of </=19 mm
was measured around a 1 ug oxacillin disc.  23 isolates
were found to be PR.  To analyze the impact of our data
on patient management, seven PR-SP isolates were
collected prospectively between 10/1992-4/1993.  Five
were recovered from blood, 1 from pleural fluid, and 1
from eye cultures.  They were tested for PR by the
microdilution technique.  Minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) results were interpreted as follows:
<0.1 ug/ml sensitive (PS), 0.1 to 1.0 ug/ml moderately
sensitive (MS), and >/=2.0 ug/ml highly resistant (HR).
4 isolates were PS and 3 were MS.  All patients
recovered.  Vancomycin therapy was resorted to in two
patients.  We did not find HR-SP in our limited study.
High rate of resistance to cephalosporins has been
reported among HR-SP strains.  There is no evidence that
therapy for proven or possible SP infection should be
initiated with vancomycin at our institution.  MS-SP can
be treated with high dose penicillin or third generation
cephalosporin.  DD results for SP indicating PR should be
verified by MIC to avoid potentially toxic therapy."

Muller, G.; Wied, S.  The Sulfonylurea Drug, Glimepiride,
Stimulates Glucose Transport, Glucose Transporter
Translocation, and Dephosphorylation in Insulin-Resistant
Rat Adipocytes Invitro

SOURCE:   Diabetes, December 1993;42(12):1852-1867.
    According to the authors' abstract of an article
published in Diabetes, "Sulfonylurea drugs are widely
used in the therapy of NIDDM.  The improvement of glucose
tolerance after long-term treatment of NIDDM patients
with the drug can be explained by stimulation of glucose
utilization in peripheral tissues that are characterized
by insulin resistance in these patients.  We studied
whether the novel sulfonylurea drug, glimepiride,
stimulates glucose transport into isolated insulin
-resistant rat adipocytes.  After long-term incubation of
the cells in primary culture with high concentrations of
glucose, glutamine, and insulin, stimulation of glucose
transport by insulin was significantly reduced both with
respect to maximal responsiveness (65% decrease of
V(max)) and sensitivity (2.6-fold increase of ED50)
compared with adipocytes cultured in medium containing a
low concentration of glucose and no insulin.  This
reflects insulin resistance of glucose transport.  In
contrast, both responsiveness and sensitivity of glucose
transport toward stimulation by glimepiride were only
marginally reduced in insulin-resistant adipocytes (15%
decrease of V(max); 1.2-fold increase of ED(50)) versus
control cells.  Glimepiride, in combination with glucose
and glutamine during the primary culture, caused
desensitization of the glucose transport system toward
stimulation by insulin, but to a lesser degree than
insulin itself (50% reduction of V(max); ninefold
increase of ED(50)).  Again, the maximal responsiveness
and sensitivity of glucose transport toward stimulation
by glimepiride were only slightly diminished.  The
presence of glimepiride during primary culture did not
antagonize the induction of insulin resistance of glucose
transport.  The stimulation of glucose transport in
insulin-resistant adipocytes by glimepiride is caused by
translocation of glucose transporters from low-density
microsomes to plasma membranes as demonstrated by
subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting with anti
-GLUT1 and anti-GLUt4 antibodies.  Immunoprecipitation of
GLUT4 from 32Pi-and [S-35]methionine-labeled adipocytes
revealed that the insulin resistance of GLUT4
translocation is accompanied by increased (three- to
fourfold) phosphorylation of GLUT4 in both low-density
microsomes and plasma membranes.  Short-term treatment of
desensitized adipocytes with glimepiride or insulin
reduced GLUT4 phosphorylation by approximately 70 and
25%, respectively, in both fractions.  We conclude that
glimepiride activates glucose transport by stimulation of
GLUT1 and GLUT4 translocation in rat adipocytes via
interference at a site downstream of the putative
molecular defect in the signaling cascade between the
insulin receptor and the glucose transport system induced
by high concentrations of glucose and insulin.  The
molecular site of glimepiride action is related to GLUT4
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, which may regulate
glucose transporter activity and translocation.  These in
vitro findings implicate an additional mode of
sulfonylurea action in the improvement of glucose
tolerance of NIDDM patients."  The corresponding author

Variability in the Pharmacokinetics of the Natural Retinoid, All-Trans
-Retinoic Acid, and Its Modulation by Ketoconazole

SOURCE:   Journal of the National Cancer Institute,
December 1, 1993;85(23):1921-1926.
    According to the authors' abstract of an article
published in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, "Background:  All-trans-retinoic acid (all
-trans RA) induces complete remission in most patients
with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).  However,
continuous oral dosing results in progressive decline in
plasma drug concentrations, which is associated with
relapse and resistance to this retinoid.  We speculated
that the decline in drug levels, indicating acquired
resistance, resulted partly from inducible cytochrome
-P450 oxidative enzymes, which can catabolize all-trans
RA.  Purpose:  We studied the clinical pharmacology of
all-trans RA in cancer patients to determine possible
mechanisms of acquired resistance and evaluated the
potential for reversal by ketoconazole, an inhibitor of
cytochrome-P450 oxidative enzymes.  Methods:  Serial
plasma samples were obtained from 54 patients with APL or
advanced lung cancer after a single oral dose of all
-trans RA (45 mg/m(2)).  In the 34 patients with advanced
lung cancer, all-trans RA (45 mg/m(2)) was administered
twice daily for 4 weeks, and, on days 2, 28, and 29,
serial plasma samples were again obtained after a single
45-mg/m(2) dose.  One hour prior to drug administration
on days 2 and 29, a single oral dose (200-1200 mg) of
ketoconazole was administered.  Endogenous plasma
concentrations of all-trans RA and 13-cis-retinoic acid
were measured in a subset of these patients and in 11
with early-stage lung cancer.  Results:  The mean area
under the curve for plasma drug concentration times time
(AUC) for all-trans RA on day 1 varied substantially
among patients.  Compared with patients with APL, the 28
patients with advanced lung cancer who completed therapy
demonstrated significantly lower AUC levels on day 1
(P=.06); a subgroup with levels less than 300 ng/mL per
hour on day 1 had lower endogenous plasma all-trans RA
concentrations than patients with APL or early-stage lung
cancer or 14 normal subjects.  Following continuous oral
treatment, the mean day 28 AUC for all-trans RA was
significantly lower than that on day 1 (213 ng/mL per
hour versus 467 ng/mL per hour; P<.01), a decline
significantly attenuated by ketoconazole, which increased
the mean plasma all-trans RA AUC on day 29 to 375 ng/mL
per hour (P<.01).  Conclusion:  Reported variability for
the pharmacokinetics of all-trans RA may result from
disease-related or population-based differences in basal
catabolic rates influenced by genetic or environmental
factors.  However, the pattern of inducible catabolism of
all-trans RA is not disease specific.  Ketoconazole
attenuates this accelerated catabolism, suggesting that
oxidation by cytochrome-P450 enzymes is an important
pathway for both constitutive and induced pathways of
all-trans RA metabolism."  The corresponding author for

Shorvon, S.D.  Hippocampal Sclerosis in Epilepsy and
Childhood Febrile Seizures

SOURCE:   Lancet, December 4, 1993;342(8884):1391-1394.
    According to the authors' abstract of an article
published in the Lancet, "The connection between
hippocampal sclerosis and childhood febrile seizures
(CFS) is a contentious issue in the study of epilepsy.
We investigated 107 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy
by high-resolution volumetric magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI).  20 had a history of CFS, 45 had focal (26) or
diffuse (19) hippocampal volume loss (HVL).  The
frequency of CFS was significantly (P<0.001) higher in
the patients with HVL, especially of the diffuse pattern,
compared to other epileptic patients without HVL and to
the general population.  Furthermore, the severity of HVL
was greatest in those with a history of CFS.  No other
clinical or demographic features were associated with
either a history of CFS or HVL.  The frequency of CFS in
patients with other structural congenital causes of
epilepsy did not differ from that in a general
population.  Although these findings show that
hippocampal sclerosis is strongly associated with a
history of CFS, they do not indicate whether this is a
causal relationship.  If CFS do cause some cases of
hippocampal sclerosis, this can not be the only
mechanism, as 64% of those with HVL gave no history of
CFS.  As diffuse HVL is more strongly associated with a
history of CFS than focal HVL, it is also possible that
CFS convert pre-existing congenital focal abnormalities
into diffuse hippocampal sclerosis.  Given the
possibility that CFS may cause hippocampal damage and
epilepsy, they require urgent medical intervention."  The

Lepage, P.; Devault, A.; Gros, P.  Activation of the
Mouse mdr3 Gene by Insertion of Retroviruses in
Multidrug-Resistant P388 Tumor Cells

SOURCE:   Molecular and Cellular Biology, December
1993;13(12):7380-7392.
    According to the authors' abstract of an article
published in Molecular and Cellular Biology, "In
multidrug-resistant (MDR) derivatives of the mouse
lymphoid tumor P388, the emergence of MDR is associated
with overexpression and transcriptional activation of the
mdr3 gene, either in the absence of (P388/VCR-10) or
concomitant with (P388/ADM-2) gene amplification.  In
both instances, Northern (RNA) blotting analyses have
suggested the presence of altered mdr3 transcripts in
these cells, possibly originating from novel
transcription initiation sites.  The mechanisms
underlying mdr3 overexpression in these cells have been
investigated.  In P388/VCR-10 cells, Southern blotting
analyses together with genomic DNA cloning and nucleotide
sequencing have demonstrated the presence of an intact
mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) within the boundaries of
intron 1 of mdr3.  cDNA cloning and nucleotide sequencing
indicated that this integration event results in the
synthesis and overexpression of a hybrid MMTV-mdr3 mRNA
which initiates within the U3 region of the 5' long
terminal repeat (LTR) of the provirus.  Consequently,
this mRNA lacks the normal exon 1 of mdr3 but contains
(i) MMTV LTR-derived sequences at its 5' end, (ii) a
novel mdr3 exon, mapping within the boundaries of intron
1 downstream of the MMTV integration site and generated
by alternative splicing, and (iii) an otherwise intact 3'
portion of mdr3 starting at exon 2.  A similar type of
analysis of P388/ADM-2 cells revealed that mdr3
overexpression in these cells is associated with the
integration of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) within
an L1Md repetitive element, immediately upstream of mdr3.
The IAP insertion results in the overexpression of hybrid
IAP-mdr3 mRNA transcripts that initiate within the 3' LTR
of the IAP and which contain IAP LTR-derived sequences at
the 5' end spliced 14 nucleotides upstream of the normal
exon 1 of mdr3.  Taken together, these results indicate
that independent retroviral insertions were the initial
mutagenic event responsible for mdr3 overexpression and
survival during drug selection of these cell lines.
Amplification of the rearranged and activated mdr3 gene
copy occurred during further selection for high-level
drug resistance in P388/ADM-2 cells."  The corresponding

    According to the authors' abstract of an article

extensive use of antibiotics in Nicaragua raises concerns
about the resulting levels of susceptibility of
pathogenic bacteria.  This is the first study that
characterizes 18 strains of N. gonorrhoeae isolated in
Nicaragua (1989), for their antibiotic susceptibility.
Strains were predominantly of the auxotype/serotype
Proto/PIB.  There was no difference in
lipopolysaccharides profiles obtained after SDS-PAGE for
all strains.  Variable expression of the PII outer
membrane protein was not associated to antimicrobial
resistance.  All strains were susceptible to ceftriaxone,
spectinomycin, rifampin and cefoxitin.  The strains were
classified in five groups based on plasmid profiles.  A
total of 78% of the isolates were penicillinase-producing
(PPNG) and 22% were tetracycline-resistant N. gonorrhoeae
(TRNG).  One PPNG strain shelved a concomitant decreased
of penicillin binding to penicillin-binding protein 2.
These randomly chosen isolates of N. gonorrhoeae from
Nicaragua possess high levels of resistance to multiple

Margaret Stanley, New Chief of CalPERS Chief Sees Room for More HMO Rate Cuts


California HMOs are unlikely to see any letup in the aggressive practices that
put the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) in the
vanguard of the health care purchasing revolution now that Margaret Stanley is
taking over as head of the program.  Stanley, named to fill the vacancy
created by the departure last year of Tom Elkin (HAA 5/12, p.  1), doesn't buy
the complaint that the HMO rate reductions negotiated by her predecessor on
behalf of the million-person pool have sliced too close to the financial bone.
Quite the contrary.  "I have reviewed the loss ratios and it struck me that
there is some room" to cut, she says.

Stanley, who served as administrator of the Washington Health Care Authority
for the past seven years, has established herself as a price-maker rather than
a price-taker.  In Washington, she negotiated rate cuts with 19 HMOs and
point-of-service plans on behalf of a pool of 300,000 public employees and
their families.  Rates for those employees dropped an average of 6 percent in
1995 and will remain flat this year.  But Stanley, formerly an HMO executive
with Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska and Group Health Cooperative of Puget
Sound agreed to let HMOs in Washington raise rates 2.9 percent in 1997.

In Washington, Stanley was also head of Washington's Basic Health Plan.
Despite the widespread perception that the state gutted its health reform law
last year, lawmakers kept funds to subsidize purchase of the plan by 330,000
low-income uninsured residents and their children.  Enrollment in the plan has
risen from 52,000 a year ago to 90,000 as of Jan.  1.  "The access expansions
are dramatic," she notes.

AHA Goes Shopping With $40 Million To Spend


The American Hospital Association (AHA) wants to spend up to $40 million
buying as many as four new businesses that provide services it can sell to
members.  An acquisition search notice says the association is looking for
publishing, education, insurance brokerage, financial service, software and
information system development, real estate management, third party
administration, temporary help, physician recruitment, market research,
medical transport, and outsourcing firms - virtually any part of the health
business except providing direct patient care or underwriting insurance.

To vault to the top of the AHA list, a company should have annual revenues of
at least $1 million, profit margins between 12 percent and 15 percent, and no
significant capital investment requirements.  The $40 million comes from the
sale last spring of AHA's liability reinsurance company, Health Providers
Insurance Co.  There is no timetable for the purchases, says AHA VP Rick Wade.
And, he says the possible purchases are "not related in any way" to current
downsizing at the AHA.  The association continues to try to sell its old
Chicago headquarters building, reduce staff, and consolidate efforts around
advocacy and education.

Drug Store Revolt Scotches Medco Maryland Contract


Trying to exercise too much muscle can be as ineffective as having too little.
That may be the lesson the health care industry can learn from the year-end
debacle in Maryland, which saw the state canceling a new pharmacy benefit
management (PBM) contract for its 92,000 employees and retirees - and an equal
number of dependents - just five days before it was to go into effect Jan.  1.
Much of the recent capping of health care outlays has come from big buyers
using their clout to extract bargain deals from suppliers, but the Maryland
story suggests that if the bargains are too great suppliers simply won't go
along.

Eli Lilly's PCS Health Systems had been the drug management contractor for
Maryland workers since 1992, but in September, after receiving bids from 11
PBM firms, the state decided to switch to Medco, the Merck & Co.  subsidiary.
The four-year, $266 million contract would have saved the state $60 million
compared with the PCS deal, estimated state budget director Marita Brown.

But those savings were based on reimbursements to participating drug stores
that were more than $2 per prescription below what the retailers had been
getting from PCS, and the retailers balked.  The three largest pharmacy chains
in the state - chains that fill Medco prescriptions under other contracts and
had therefore been included in the network Medco used to win the state
contract - announced they would not fill prescriptions under the plan.  They
said the reimbursement rate was so low that they would lose money on each
transaction.  In all, 600 outlets making up about 60 percent of the drug
stores in the state nixed participation.

Medco insisted that the rates it was planning to pay the stores, while below
what they had been getting, were in line with payments under similar plans in
other states.  The firm scrambled to find enough other outlets to provide
statewide coverage, but couldn't satisfy state officials in time.  "Medco
promised something it couldn't deliver," Brown complained; the attorney
general's office began looking into whether the PBM firm had made
misrepresentations about its delivery network in its September bid.  After
Maryland canceled the Medco contracts, officials told workers to keep dealing
with PCS, and began planning to garner new bids in early spring.  In the new
round, the state may demand that bidders show contracts at the bid price with
the outlets they claim are in their networks.

But at the same time, state law enforcement officials began investigating the
decision by the big chains to reject the Medco business.  The question:  Were
the decisions arrived at individually, or were they the fruit of an unlawful
conspiracy among the chains?  Rite Aid Corp., with the largest number of
outlets in Maryland, owns Eagle Managed Care, one of the losing bidders for
the PBM contract.

Three-year Caps on Fees Big Plus for Minnesota Coalition


For some employer insurance buying coalitions, the pitch that closes a sale is
lower rates.  For some, it's that buying is made easy.  But for the Minnesota
Business Coalition, the feature that makes its insurance plan a real winner is
budgetability.  The fact that a company that signs up now has a guaranteed
rate cap through 1998 is what has allowed the program to almost double in size
in the year it has been in operation, say the top officials of the Employers
Assn.  (EA) and the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, its two sponsoring
organizations.  The coalition now supplies insurance to 18,000 persons at 275
companies.

Of course, it's important that the rate guarantee is an attractive one.  When
the coalition began at the start of 1995, it had a contract with Allina Health
System's Medica HMO calling for 1996 rates to go up no more than 6.5 percent
and the hike in 1997 to be no more than 6 percent.  But when it emerged in
December from negotiations with Allina, EA's James Mulrooney says, "there was
very powerful news:  we had beat the cap."  In fact, rates are going up only
4.9 percent this year.  And Allina promised that the 1998 rates will be no
more than 6 percent above 1997's.

An employer doesn't get an immediate bargain when it joins the coalition.  Its
initial rates are based on the demographic characteristics and claims
experience of its workforce.  But in all subsequent years, all those covered
are treated as part of the same pool, and any year-to-year increases are a
uniform percentage from that initial rate.  A company must sign on for at
least three years, and promise to pick up for its workers at least half of the
total cost.  Almost all of the coalition participants offered health coverage
before, and a substantial number - close to 20 percent - have more than 100
employees.

The coalition was born when Prudential, which had long sold a health plan to
EA members, in mid-1994 announced it would no longer offer a managed care
product in the Twin Cities.  EA sifted through bids from other plans, and
picked Medica, but at the same time decided it would be in a stronger
bargaining position if it teamed up with the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce.

Two Medica plans are available; one uses a broad 6,000-doctor network and no
gatekeeper, the other has a much more limited choice of physicians and
requires that all referrals to specialists be from a primary care provider.
To get into the coalition plan, a business must be a member of one of the two
groups.  The coalition itself imposes no fees; the work is done by staffers of
the two business organizations.

In addition to the three-year rate cap, the other demand from the coalition
was that the winning HMO keep up a constant program of health education
efforts for enrollees.  Much of that effort last year was dedicated to
profiling workers to pinpoint just which topics would produce the biggest
payoff in holding down health care outlays.  That produced the priority list
for this year's program:  back pain, stress, heart disease, and smoking
cessation.

New Texas Regulations for HMOs Mandate Extensive ER Out-of-Network Coverage


Texas is a fertile ground for the growth of managed care.  A new report by
InterStudy (see below) rates Galveston as the small market with the greatest
HMO growth potential, and spotlights Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Ft.  Worth,
Lubbock, Amarillo, and Waco as other comers.  But as of Jan.  1, plans eyeing
those markets must cope with new insurance regulations from the state Dept.
of Insurance.  The regulations were developed on orders from Gov.  George W.
Bush (R) after he vetoed as "too much government regulation" HMO restrictions
passed by the legislature.

The most controversial part of the new rules covers reimbursement for
emergency services from out-of-network providers.  Not only is Texas requiring
that plans cover all medical examinations performed by emergency care
providers and all services to stabilize an emergency condition, but it is also
mandating HMOs okay coverage of post-stabilization services -thereby closing
the option of later denying coverage for doctor-approved treatment.  This,
complains Geoff Wurzel, executive director of the Texas HMO Assn., undercuts
the goal of reducing unnecessary use of emergency rooms and "could pull the
primary care doctor out of the role of directing the care of his or her
patient."

The new regulations also demand that plans provide enrollees policy outlines
"in a readable and understandable format" that detail:

* services covered, including limitations and exclusions, * how members can
obtain treatment when they are away from their hometowns, * preauthorization
requirements, and * appeals procedures.

The new regulations also give bargaining muscle to doctors who want to sign up
with a reluctant HMO - although less than the advocates of an any willing
provider provision had hoped for.  The HMO does not have to accept an
applicant, but does have to explain in writing why it has said "no" and make
available any economic profiling data that played a part in that decision.

Pinpointing Where HMOs Will Grow:  The Key Factors Depend on Market Size


Managed care penetration continues to be spotty around the country, with
wildly different rates of HMO membership in what might seem to be similar
markets.  But the longer the plans operate, the easier it is for analysts to
pinpoint the factors that make an area ripe for rapid HMO growth.  A new set
of calculations from InterStudy, the Minneapolis-based group that has been
following the industry since 1973, produces a list of the hot targets for HMO
expansion.  The list ranges from markets that already have a lot of patients
in managed care - such as Sacramento CA and Rochester NY, where penetration is
more than 50 percent - to cities where the concept now barely has a toehold.

Everywhere, plans that are already successful in keeping down the days of
hospitalization per 1,000 enrollees are poised for zesty growth.  That's the
situation in Los Angeles, Albany, and Jersey City, for example.  Equally
important is the plan proving that it gives adequate care to those who do need
to go to the hospital:  the higher the average length of stay, the higher the
potential for HMO growth (a factor deemed important in the healthy projections
for such markets as St.  Louis, Pittsburgh, and Newark).

But perhaps the most significant InterStudy finding is that major growth
stimulants are different in different sized markets:

In big cities, the fact that HMOs have already garnered a big chunk of the
population is likely to lead to more growth.  HMOs that have ties to preferred
provider organizations (PPO) already established in the market are good bets
for growth, but it is actually a deterrent to HMO signups for the managed care
plan to be affiliated with an indemnity insurer that is successful in the
market.

In medium-sized cities, what counts is competition.  If there are more than
two competing plans, it inhibits growth; it is especially inhibiting if the
rival already has a big market share.  And it is a deterrent if the HMO is
affiliated with a PPO.  But the presence of for-profit plans spurs further HMO
growth.

In smaller towns, the key issue is whether those enrolled in public programs
are already in HMOs; if there's a popular Medicare managed care plan and if a
significant number of Medicaid participants are in HMOs, rapid growth can be
expected.  Here, it is the presence of not-for-profit plans that is an
indicator that the market will take off.

High Pay for HMO Execs Blasted in New Study


When doctors set out to set up their own managed care organizations, they
always say that one advantage the plans will have is that they will not pay
the kind of salaries that insurers pay the executives who run their HMOs.  Now
the doctors have gotten some support from a survey of executive compensation
that finds that in fact those at the top of commercial health insurance
companies do take home disproportionately high pay.  The report from Graef S.
Crystal, a compensation specialist who has long complained that many public
companies pay their top brass too much, also spotlights pharmaceutical and
biotechnology firms as paying chief executives far more than other types of
companies of similar size and performance pay their counterparts.

Crystal began with a three-year pay average - including salary, stock options,
bonuses, and all other forms of compensation - of the CEOs of 896
publicly-traded businesses.  About 40 percent of the differences he found
could be attributed to company size or to rewards given brass who had boosted
their corporation's dividends or stock prices.  The rest he attributed to
industry practices.  As a group, those running health insurance companies got
80 percent above the average for all businesses of their size and track
records - a figure at least partially explained by the heavy use of stock
options as compensation and the escalating stock prices since the beginning of
the study in 1992.  The $6.1 million a year made by Foundation Health CEO
Daniel D.  Crowley was calculated by Crystal to be 277 percent above the
average for its group.

SC Blues See Big Profits Selling Network Software


For tyro networks of hospitals and physicians to be truly integrated, they
need ways to communicate treatment and financial information quickly and
reliably.  And Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina is eyeing that
need as a potential moneymaker.  Within months, the insurer expects to roll
out, through its Companion Technologies subsidiary, software that will
integrate hospital computer systems and the practice management systems of
affiliated doctors into an existing South Carolina Health Information Network.
The next step:  licensing the software in North Carolina, Kentucky, Florida,
and Texas, where Companion already has a major market presence.  Hookup and
transaction fees will be other sources of revenue.

The existing network already links every hospital in South Carolina and 60
percent of the doctors.  It allows providers to submit claims electronically
to virtually any payer, and get answers to questions about patient eligibility
and the status of pending claims.  The next step is to add an automated
utilization review system that will give providers access to the Blues'
treatment protocols and automatic okays for admissions and stay continuations
that fit within those protocols.

For integrated delivery networks, Companion promises additional services.  For
instance, the plan will store information stripped from detailed billings,
patient statements, and claim forms for use by customer service
representatives at the providers' offices.  When a patient calls with a
billing question, the representative can pull that information from the Blues'
mainframe computer and have it presented on one screen.  "That's a big-time
productivity enhancement," says Companion marketing vice-president David Ward.

American Ambivalence:  For-profits Called Efficient But Not Community-minded


In the first week of November 1995, Louis Harris & Associates conducted
telephone interviews with a randomly-selected representative 1,007 adults
across the country to gauge their perceptions - not their knowledge - of
ownership trends in the health care industry.  Respondents correctly spotted
the trend towards more and more hospitals and health plans being in the hands
of for-profit corporations and decried the development, but admitted that it
made little difference in their own selection decisions.  Here is an excerpt
from the report on the results by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which funded
the survey:

Americans generally believe for-profit care organizations, whether hospitals,
HMOs or other health insurance plans, are more efficient and provide a better
quality service than their not-for-profit counterparts, but they also think
for-profits are less community-oriented and more costly for the individual
consumer, according to new survey findings reported by the Kaiser Family
Foundation.  The survey also finds that most Americans perceive a trend
towards for-profit health care to be underway in this country and a majority
(54%) believe this to be a "bad thing" for health care.  A quarter (24%) think
the increase in for-profit health care doesn't matter very much and 19% say it
is a "good thing" for health care in this country.

When it comes to making decisions about their own health care, however, the
largest group - 46 percent of Americans - say an organization's profit status
doesn't make much of a difference in who they "trust to provide [them] with
high quality health care at a reasonable price."  Almost equal percentages
specify a preference for not-for-profit (26%) as do for for-profit (25%).

"This data illustrates the ambivalence that exists on the part of the public
toward for-profit and not-for-profit health care.  Americans want health care
organizations to be efficient and responsive, and in that way 'business-like,'
but at the same time they don't want them to be 'like other businesses' for
fear of higher costs and community interests being sacrificed," said Mark D.
Smith, MD, MBA, executive vice-president, Kaiser Family Foundation.

With a Quarter Million Persons To Cover, Colorado Coalition Starts with a Lot
of Clout


The campaign begun last spring to lure Colorado's biggest employers back into
an affiliation with the Colorado Health Care Purchasing Alliance (HAA, 3/24,
p.3) didn't work.  The big companies, after nine months of meetings, decided
that they could benefit from being part of a coordinated attack on health
coverage issues, but that they should have their own group with no formal ties
to the Alliance.

That new organization, called the Colorado Business Group on Health (CBGH),
includes the state, the Denver public school system, and 10 big companies,
including Lockheed Martin, U.S.  West, Norwest Banks, and the one big firm
that had been a faithful backer of the Alliance:  Coors Brewing Co.  Together
they spend just over $400 million providing health care coverage to 250,000
Coloradans.

The 12 announced formation of the group last month, but have yet to
incorporate or select officers.  CBGH ads for an executive director will
appear in Denver newspapers next week.  "We'd like someone who has some
knowledge of the local health plans and providers and a real good
understanding of the local markets," says U.S.  West Health Benefits Manager
Patricia Theno, whose invitation in March to Patricia Powers, head of the
Pacific Business Group on Health (PBGH), to speak to Colorado companies kicked
off the talks that led to the formation of the new group.  Some of the
companies that showed up for the Powers presentation, such as Safeway and IBM,
have not joined CBGH yet.  The current members say that they are welcome, but
that the present members are willing to put up enough money to make the new
coalition run:  they aren't going to spend any energy recruiting additional
members.

CBGH has formed what it calls a "strategic partnership" with PBGH, where U.S.
West and Lockheed are already active participants.  Initially, that
partnership means that the Colorado group will borrow PBGH's structure and
some of its projects (for instance, on encouraging preventive care and
developing performance standards) and jointly participate with the West Coast
group on its annual survey pinpointing the value of the health care delivered
by each participating health plan.  Eventually the Colorado group plans to
negotiate with insurers on behalf of its members, hammering out prices but
leaving it up to each employer to decide which plan or plans to offer its
workers.  But that's not likely to happen until the 1998 plan year.

The state's biggest companies pulled out of the Alliance in the 1980s, when it
decided to operate as a purchasing cooperative.  The Alliance had hoped to
develop some sort of affiliate membership that would get the big boys back in
its fold, but the CBGH members continued to look at the Alliance as a grouping
of small businesses that didn't address what they saw as the very different
needs of large firms.  "Many cities have more than one purchaser coalition -
one for larger employers, another to represent small business," the group
explained in a fact sheet issued with the announcement of its formation.  But
both groups promise that they will work together on some projects, such as
member satisfaction surveys and lobbying in the state legislature.

Do Small Firms Have Sicker Workers?  Study Says 'No'


One of the reasons behind the formation of health insurance purchasing
cooperatives for small employers is the prohibitive rates quotes some such
firms receive when they go out on their own to buy policies.  Those high rates
are based, in part, on the belief by insurers that even when all other factors
are equal workers in such firms are higher risks than those who work for big
employers.  That's hooey, say the authors of a report published in the winter
issue of Health Affairs.

The study was conducted on a huge database:  20.5 million records on 1.4
million persons covered by the Blues of western Pennsylvania over the three
years ending Dec.  31, 1990.  Those enrollees got their coverage through firms
that bought insurance for 1 to 18,730 persons; about 95 percent of the
employers had 50 or fewer persons enrolled.

EEEEEE

oEEEEEE- those with no more than 10 persons covered by the Blues - did have
higher than average medical costs:  $992 compared with an overall average of
$916.  But employees of the very biggest companies (those with over 1,000
subscribers) also had high costs:  an average of $987.  Those differences
could be entirely explained by differences in the insured populations at such
firms - both had a higher proportion of workers over age 55.

The authors of the study - a team led by Wanda Young, founder of the
International Center for Health Services Research in Pittsburgh - do admit
that "small businesses do in fact post greater financial risks to insurers -
that is, their health care costs are less stable and thus harder to predict
with sufficient accuracy for firm-specific experience rating."  But the answer
to that, they argue, is a community rating approach which lumps large numbers
of companies together.  Of the 28,990 employers in the database, 65 percent
would have paid more under community rating - but the amount of their
subsidization would have been far less than the savings given the other 35
percent.

Even a small increase for firms with healthier employees is a problem however,
warns Health Insurance Assn.  of America VP Edward Neuschler.  He says that
since "so many small employers are right at the margin, 'Can I afford this or
not?' that's a prescription for driving healthy lives out of the market."

Article Proposes New Standards for Paying For Experimental Technology


Health plans are being offered a compromise solution to the growing
contentious problem of when to rate an innovative medical technology no longer
experimental and therefore reimbursable.  A proposal to appear in a
forthcoming issue of Health Affairs suggests that health plans write into
their policies this bargain:  They will pay the costs of new technologies,
although they are still experimental, if they are part of a well-designed
trial, but only if the manufacturers agree that the devices will not be
available outside the trial.

A new approach is necessary because with government limiting its support for
assessment of medical technology, health plans are becoming the "control
valves" determining which new ideas are accepted, says Sean Tunis, MD, former
director of the health program at the now-defunct federal Office of Technology
Assessment and an author of the article.  Yet health insurance is "an
increasingly stressed, very competitive, over-stretched industry that doesn't
have the tools or capacity to make those kinds of decisions," he says.

HCFA Says Drop Certification As A HEDIS Measurement


The widespread acceptance of the Health Care Employer Data & Information Set
(HEDIS) of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) is not without
its attendant problems.  NCQA is now under pressure to back off on at least
one key measure because managed care plans, eager for a good HEDIS rating, are
being too diligent about responding to it.

At least that is the view of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA),
which is working with NCQA to develop by January 1997 a third generation HEDIS
that can be used by Medicare recipients as well as the business buyers of
health coverage that now constitute HEDIS's primary audience.  Under fire from
HCFA:  the use of board certification as a measure of the competence of the
doctors on an HMO panel.

That criterion, HCFA persuaded the Medicare subcommittee of NCQA's Committee
on Performance Measure- ment, at least as applied to primary care physicians,
is guilty of exacerbating the shortage of such gatekeepers available through
HMOs.  Many plans, says Jeffrey Kang, chief medical officer of HCFA's Office
of Managed Care, translated the HEDIS measure into an absolute requirement
that all doctors who sign up for participation in an HMO must have board
certification.  That excludes many good doctors and makes it tougher for
Medicare recipients to choose a plan with an easy-to-reach primary care
provider.

The core problem:  While virtually everyone agrees that there are other
measures of quality - such as getting continuing education and even having
demonstrated competence - none of them are as easily determined as whether or
not a doctor is board certified.  And buyers of health coverage - the
companies HEDIS was designed for - want to assure their workers that they are
being sent to board-certified doctors, according to NCQA VP Cary Sennett.

Hearing Set Jan.  10 on Kentucky Rate Review Authority


Kentucky officials have a Jan.  10 hearing date on their motion to toss out of
court a suit filed by HMOs who fear state insurance regulators may order them
to lower 1996 premiums.  The state insurance commissioner is reviewing the
sharply higher rates insurers are charging following implementation of the
state's 1994 reform law, and needs dismissal of the suit to order any changes
based on that review.

The commissioner ordered the review following complaints by some state workers
about rates they're paying through the Kentucky Health Purchasing Alliance.
However, the review covers all rates in the state, both inside and outside the
alliance.  Departing Gov.  Brereton Jones (D) charged late last year that
insurer rates were far higher than they needed to be to cover added costs
imposed by the 1994 reforms (HAA 12/8).  Jones ordered insurers to refile
rates by Dec.  11, triggering the suit by the Kentucky Assn.  of HMOs.

Robert Quirk, KAH President, tells HAA that although the state has authority
to review rates and reject unreasonable charges, it can't actually set rates.
Quirk says the commissioner in effect is setting rates by specifying in the
ongoing review that they can't vary by more than 10 percent from a specified
figure.

In addition to fighting for lower rates, state officials are bracing for an
attempt in the legislature to exempt university and local government workers
from a requirement that public sector workers purchase coverage through the
Alliance.

States Curb Health Care Costs


For the first time in 10 years, the increase in the cost of health benefits
provided to state employees under indemnity plans was less than the medical
care components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  The annual survey by Segal
Co., a benefits consulting firm, found that in 1995 the average total monthly
cost for family coverage for state workers was $448.29 a month, up just 1.95
percent from the 1994 average.  Just over half the states reported no increase
at all in the cost of the coverage.  Overall hikes for employee-only and
retiree-only coverage were also low, although the rise in the cost of covering
retirees and their dependents was higher than the CPI.

As in previous years, costs varied widely between the more generous states and
those with less lush benefits.  Michigan's costs, at $800.99 per month per
family, were far higher than any other state's; Montana's $289, while $20 more
than its 1994 costs, was still the lowest in the nation.  There were also
dramatic regional variations in the percentage of the total cost absorbed by
the state.  In the Northeast and the West, many states pick up the entire
cost, while in the South the burden falls heavily on employees.

Nationwide, 35 percent of state employees are enrolled in health maintenance
organizations, with the portion amounting to more than 80 percent of the
workers in Arizona and California, but fewer than 5 percent in North Dakota,
Idaho, and Connecticut.

In many jurisdictions, the state buys coverage for a lot of public sector
employees not on its own payroll.  In Georgia, for instance, in addition to
its 65,200 state government workers, the state buys coverage for 130,600
public school teachers.  In North Carolina, only 28 percent of the workers in
the state pool are actually state employees.  Segal's Clark Yaggy and Daniel
W.  Jackson write, "We can see a continuation of the relatively new trend for
state health benefits plans to include other public employers.  State employee
plans have always been among the largest in their states, and the increased
negotiating clout produced by their representation of large numbers of
employees has not escaped the notice of legislators and others seeking to
solve some of the cost pressures of smaller public entities."

Affiliates No More, Two Top Hospitals Merge


Can hospitals realize the efficiency benefits of size through affiliations
that let each keep its own separate identity?  Two of the premier institutions
in St.  Louis have decided the answer is no.  After three years of working
together under an umbrella health plan, Barnes Hospital and Jewish Hospital
have agreed to a full-fledged merger.  At the beginning, the combined
29-member board will have co-chairs.  The philanthropic foundations that
support the two hospitals will also be combined into one.

Links between the two institutions are longstanding:  Barnes was founded as a
teaching affiliate of the Washington University medical school in 1914 and
Jewish affiliated with Washington in 1964.  Since its creation in 1992, their
jointly-owned Barnes-Jewish Health System has rapidly expanded, merging with
Christian Health Services and forging ties with Missouri Baptist and St.
Louis Children's.  The health system includes 5,000 beds and provides close to
30 percent of the inpatient care in the St.  Louis market.

But the halfway house of affiliation wasn't enough, the brass at both
institutions decided.  There was still too much duplication.  With the merger,
the medical staff will be fully integrated and clinical services can be
realigned by dropping some services offered by both institutions.  The first
project of the merged Barnes-Jewish Hospital will be to build new cancer care
and outpatient centers.

Also in St.  Louis, United HealthCare agreed to sell its 31,000-member
MetraHealth HMO to Principal Health Care.  United had to get rid of the HMO to
get approval of its merger with MetraHealth.  Principal already owns a St.
Louis plan with 18,000 members.

In Brief


Two of the savviest investors in the health care industry have turned their
attentions to behavioral care.  Richard Rainwater, a co-founder of Columbia
Hospital and an investor in the HCA leveraged buyout in 1989, and Columbia/HCA
board member Darla Moore together are buying a 12.3 percent stake of Magellan
Health Services, formerly known as Charter Medical, which manages behavioral
benefits for 12 million enrollees.

Beleaguered AHI Healthcare Systems, which integrates physicians into local
networks and negotiates HMO contracts for them, was hit by a suit from
stockholders claiming that when it went public it was not frank enough about
potential difficulties with its acquisition of the Lakewood Health Plan.  At
the same time, the company admitted that is larger-than-expected losses have
put in it default with its bank loan agreement.

Summit Medical Systems, which sells clinical outcomes database software, has
gotten its hands on a valuable new compilation.  The company signed a joint
venture agreement with Duke University to commercialize the information on
500,000 cardiovascular procedures on 95,000 patients, which Duke has collected
over 26 years.  The first products, expected to be on the market late this
year, are supposed to improve providers' ability to collect and analyze
clinical outcomes data.

The Rocky Mountain Heart Consortium shut down at the end of December, unable
to get the grants from Denver hospitals and other funding sources needed to
keep going.  In operation since 1991, the group's research projects focused on
the cost and outcomes of cardiovascular procedures in the state, sixth in the
nation in number of open-heart surgery programs.

Discounts negotiated by health insurers will be shared with enrollees under a
new Missouri law that went into effect Jan.  1.  Passed in response to a state
survey that showed many plans base the insured's copayment on usual and
customary charges, the new law requires that the split be of the actual
charge.

In markets with little managed care, hospitals are cutting costs just as
vigorously as those under pressure from HMOs, according to a report from the
Center for Healthcare Industry Performance Studies (CHIPS).  While hospitals
in markets with high managed care penetration continue to have, on average,
shorter lengths of stay and lower costs for most surgical procedures, the gap
is narrowing, CHIPS found.  In fact, for some procedures, such as cardiac
catheterization and excision of intervertebral disc, the average is actually
lower at hospitals in markets where there's little use of HMOs.

U.S. Attorney to Sue Some Hospitals
In Metzinger Lab False Claims Case


Some hospitals reportedly will face false claims
charges this week, as the government expands the scope of a case in
which an outside consultant allegedly suggested questionable
billing practices. Experts say the feds will hit consultants hard
if their goal is to up Medicare revenue, so make sure lab claims
are backed by documentation.

The government this week is expected to sue up to 19 hospitals,
adding them to a pending false claims lawsuit the feds filed last
year against the Metzinger Associates billing consultants.
The feds will claim the hospitals, on Metzinger Associates' advice,
billed Medicare for clinical lab work that wasn't needed or wasn't
provided as charged. Dozens of other hospitals that used Metzinger
Associates are expected to settle false claims allegations after
doing self-audits at the government's request (HBLS 7/19/95, p. 1).
According to sources, the U.S. attorney in Phildelphia says it
chose which hospitals to sue based on: (1) their size; (2) the
amount of evidence the feds have against the hospital; (3) the
degree of cooperation in the federal investigation; (4) how much
Metzinger earned based upon payments received from the hospital;
and (5) the nature of voluntary disclosure of misconduct to the
government.

The latest development in the case has implications for consulting
firms and the providers who use them, because the Metzinger lawsuit
opened a Pandora's box of potential false claims cases over
squeezing revenue from Medicare.

"The Metzinger Associates case will prompt the government to review
other consultants who are providing the same services, or other
types of services, when the arrangements are structured for revenue
enhancement instead of compliance with governmental regulations,"
says one expert, who asked that his name not be used.

The insider says consultants should:
o       "Raise their internal quality
control programs to a much higher level to assure their
recommendations comply with third-party documentation and billing
requirements;"
o       "Have documentation in their files
to support recommendations;" and
o       Do more than interview hospital
personnel to determine compliance with third-party regulations.
Review underlying documents to corroborate the information gathered
inthe interview process. "Talk is cheap," the expert notes.
"Looking at underlying documents to support what personnel says and
keeping a set of documents in the consultant's file are important
in the event the government challenges the consultant's
recommendations."

For example, if the hospital bills for a five-part complete blood
count with an automatic differential, verify that the laboratory
has the capacity and the equipment to perform such tests, says
another billing expert.
The two executives who ran Metzinger Associates, Harry Metzinger
and William Ritter, are slated for a trial this spring. They deny
wrongdoing.

Experimental Device Repayment Sought;At Least One
Criminal Case Expected


Hospitals need to set up a system to make sure they
do not bill Medicare for non-reimburseable, breakthrough
experimental devices and related services. Meanwhile, the feds have
taken the first step to recoup pre-November 1995 payments for the
devices.

Some hospitals are starting to get letters from the government
requesting records of Medicare claims for experimental devices and
related medical care so the government can figure out how much
hospitals allegedly owe Medicare because HCFA says the devices
weren't covered before Nov. 1, 1995, sources say.
The government's next step will be to actually demand a specific
amount of money back, a source says.
And in a new revelation, every hospital scrutinized by the feds for
improper Medicare claims for experimental medical devices allegedly
submitted these claims, at least half knew the claims were
inappropriate, and almost 30 hospitals tried to cover it up, a top
official from the HHS Inspector General's Office told a Senate
panel last week.
Deputy IG Jack Hartwig, testifying at a Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations hearing, outlined the government's
strategy in dealing with alleged improper billing for experimental
devices:
(1) The IG and HCFA are calculating overpayments to providers and
plan to seek repayment (HBLS 1/24/96, p. 1);
(2) Evidence of alleged criminal conduct will be investigated;
(3) Fraud that has been identified is being addressed by Justice
(see story below); and
(4) The feds are addressing weaknesses in accounting and tracking
of investigational devices, in hospital oversight, and in obtaining
informed patient consent.
Physicians also are being probed on the issue.
To avoid further trouble over device billing, attorney Len Homer
advises hospitals to "have absolute controls so no billings are
submitted to Medicare for services involving [breakthrough]
investigational devices" not covered by Medicare. The FDA calls
breakthrough non-covered devices category A devices.
But hospitals still must submit "no pay" bills so Medicare can keep
track of care patients receive, even if it's not reimbursable, and
to reflect statistical changes in the cost report, says Homer, who
represents hospitals in the device case.
Plus, hospitals should "work out with beneficiaries [getting
category A devices] whether they will look to the beneficiary for
payments," which Homer says is legal if the patient is told in
advance and gives consent.
Also at the hearing, the Senate panel blasted HCFA and the IG for
not cracking down on Medicare payments for experimental devices
before HCFA began covering them. Subcommittee Chairman William Roth
(R-Del) displayed internal hospital memos that purportedly showed
some hospitals' knowledge of improper Medicare billing for
experimental devices.
In a memo on letterhead from Sutter Memorial Hospital in
Sacramento, an official wrote, "Clearly, by the letter of the law
we are at risk. However, there is obviously no communication
between the FDA and HCFA, which would easily allow HCFA to identify
the devices, and given the number of exemptions currently occuring,
I would think our overall risks are small."
Testifying at the hearing, the administrator who wrote the memo
denied he was admitting knowledge of wrongdoing.
In their defense, hospital officials at the hearing said Medicare
rules on this were fuzzy.
A University of Washington Medical Center executive said his
"belief was that HCFA's policy was not binding and was flexibly
enforced, and is amply supported by HCFA's own actions."

Feds: Sutter Knew of Errors,Thought Policy Non-Binding


A California hospital stays in Medicare, but pays more
than $1 million and agrees to a compliance plan to resolve
allegations it knew it wrongly billed Medicare for experi-mental
cardiac devices.

Sutter Memorial Hospital knew it wasn't entitled to Medicare
payments for experimental medical devices and was told this more
than once by its peer review organization, the prosecutor in the
case against Sutter told HBLS.
The Sutter health system in California last week became the first
hospital in the country to settle false claims allegations that it
billed Medicare for devices that lacked FDA premarketing approval
and therefore were not covered by Medicare.
In addition to paying the government $1.3 million, Sutter agreed to
a compliance plan to prevent and detect fraud in its organization.
"I think the Medicare billing rules were clear and not confusing,"
says Michael Hirst, chief of affirmative civil enforcement in the
Sacramento U.S. attorney's office and a prosecutor who worked on
the case.
Los Angeles attorney Russell Hayman, Sutter's outside counsel,
responded that "Sutter was unaware of manual provisions until about
the end of 1991. When they learned about the manual provisions,
they concluded it was non-binding - it was policy and not law - and
continued to bill. They regret that, and wish they had sought
clarification from the government prior to that time."
@SUBHEAD = Sutter Dropped from Whistleblower Lawsuit
The settlement notes that Sutter, as a Medicare provider, got at
least one copy of the Medicare manual provisions that says
procedures involving investigational devices are not reasonable and
necessary, and therefore not covered by Medicare.
Providers say the manual provisions are not official, that no
regulations were ever finalized disallowing such payments, and that
Medicare contractors knowingly reimbursed providers for such
devices for years.
HCFA started officially covering next-generation experimental
devices in November.
In return for settling, Sutter will not be thrown out of Medicare
and was dropped from the whistleblower-initiated false claims
lawsuit pending against a number of hospitals for billing Medicare
for experimental devices and related medical care.
But the settlement relates only to cardiac experimental devices,
Hirst notes, and the settlement frees only the hospital, not
physicians, from further legal problems related to investigational
devices.
Among the elements of Sutter's compliance plan:
(1) Hold training sessions on experimental device billing for
relevant fourth-year students, residents, staff physicians and
clerical employees;
(2) Include in new-employee orientations instruction on proper
billing; and
(3) Distribute written materials to all relevant physicians and
clerical staff stating Sutter's commitment to accurate billing.

New Medicare Enrollment FormSeeks More Financial Data


Make room for Medicare's new enrollment form in your
business plan because filling it out will take a lot of time - and
you must certify in writing that the information is true.

HCFA will soon issue a new Medicare provider enrollment form that
asks providers for more detailed financial and other information to
prove they are qualified to bill Medicare.
"It's very extensive and people should take extreme care in filling
out the form because" they must certify at the end that everything
reported in the form is true, says attorney Anne Branan, with Broad
and Cassel.
Branan, of Fort Lauderdale, also suggests upper management complete
the form or review it - especially if your outside billing agency
fills it out for you.
The new form is part of HCFA's push to stop paying improper claims
on the front end, instead of paying wayward providers and getting
law enforcement to try to get the money back.
"The first step to ending pay-and-chase is to take a good look at
who comes into the system," says Judy Berek, special advisor on
fraud to HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck.

Manager, Subcontractor Data Demanded

Among other things, the form asks:

o        Whether providers use a billing
agency, and, if so, the agency's name, phone number, and employee
identification number. "Get that information from reliable sources
in the billing company," Branan advises.
o       Who is managing the organization,
and personal data on them, including Social Security numbers.
o       For independent physiological labs,
subcontractors' names and related information, such as their
Medicare numbers and, if they're doctors, what CPT codes they will
perform.

Completing the form "will be an overwhelming amount of work and
can't be approached in a haphazard manner," Branan says. "Count
this in your business plan."
This is another reminder for providers to make sure billing systems
churn out accurate claims and to install a compliance plan to
prevent and detect fraud, observes San Francisco attorney Paul
DeMuro. Apparently, HCFA feels "if they can develop a better form
or tracking system, they'll be able to use their statistical edits
and other tools" to sniff out fraud, he says.

Providers: Medicaid Contractor Owes Millions for
Claims


Providers say a company that has a risk-bearing contract for Massachusetts'
Medicaid managed mental health program owes them millions of dollars, so
the providers may sue.  The state has pledged to make sure providers get
any money they may be owed.

Massachusetts mental health providers are prepared to sue the
state's Medicaid managed mental health contractor over $6 million
to $9 million in allegedly unpaid claims, and the state has
promised that providers will get any money if it's owed them.
The providers, who may sue Mental Health Management of America for
breach of contract, say the contractor trapped them in a catch-22
to avoid paying claims for mental health and substance abuse
treatment. The contractor required that providers submit claims
within 90 days of service and put preauthorization numbers on
claims, then the contractor allegedly didn't furnish the
preauthorization numbers promptly enough for the providers to meet
the deadline.

Claims Processing `Not Their Strength'

"Claims processing was not [Mental Health Management's] strength,"
acknowledges Bruce Bullen, commissioner of the state Division for
Medical Assistance, which oversees Medicaid. There was a problem
with a claims backlog.
"We'll work this through with providers," Bullen says. "We'll make
sure [Mental Health Management] is responsible for complying with
the contract. But it doesn't mean we'll pay all claims."
He noted that Mental Health Management "performed in a superior
fashion in some areas, like quality management."
John Kahn, a lawyer representing Mental Health Corp. of
Massachusetts, an organization of 65 mental health agencies
allegedly owed money by Mental Health Management, agreed that
quality of care wasn't at issue. But he says providers worry when
contractors are rewarded, even indirectly, for keeping clinical
costs down. "The arrangement under which service providers have a
financial incentive not to maximize service is at the heart of the
concern about managed care programs," Kahn says.
Massachusetts did not renew Mental Health Management's Medicaid
managed care contract past June. And about a year ago, Mental
Health Management's parent company lost a contract in New Mexico.
In a letter to a Mental Health Management outside lawyer, Kahn asks
the contractor to process the providers' unpaid claims and suspend
troublesome edits related to prior approval, billing within 90
days, a 365-day payment appeals process, and claims identification
numbers.
Kahn says Mental Health Management hasn't yet met the providers'
demands, and, if necessary, they'll take the contractor to court.
At press time, the contractor did not respond to a request for an
interview. But the two sides are scheduled to meet next week.

State: Providers Will Get Money Owed Them

Mental Health Management of America, owned by First Financial
Management of Atlanta, got the Massachusetts managed care contract
for mental health and substance abuse treatment in 1992.
Mental Health Management broke new ground in providing
comprehensive managed mental health care to Medicaid, so there were
growing pains, says Ron Preston, HCFA associate regional
administrator. But that's not why Mental Health Management's
contract wasn't renewed beyond June, he maintains.
"Other applicants had more solid applications," Preston says.
Massachusetts Behavioral Health Partners won the bid.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts' mental health providers claim Mental
Health Management owes them money. "There's a lot of anxiety that
every bill is honored, and that's a reasonable concern. We want to
make sure [the contractor does] everything in compliance" as the
contract is closed out in June, Bullen says. He notes the state
agency is auditing the firm.
In the state contract, Mental Health Management was paid $11.5
million for administrative expenses under a risk-bearing contract
that allowed it to make up to $750,000 if they kept expenses in
line or shell out up to $750,000 if the company went over budget.
The first 92 cents of every dollar saved went to the state, and the
remaining 8 cents to Mental Health Management, since renamed First
Mental Health.
Because the firm's and providers' reimbursement pools were linked,
the less paid out in medical costs, the more the firm made under
the contract, Kahn says.
But Mental Health Management was "not unduly rewarded," Bullen
says. "There's always limited risk and limited savings. It doesn't
provide an incentive for overly restrictive clinical behavior."

Feds Target More HospitalsFor Attending MD Billing


You don't have to be a major teaching hospital to face
false claims problems over billing Medicare for attending
physicians supervising residents' work, as more Pennsylvania
hospitals have found out.

The feds have begun a broader false claims dragnet for attending
physician billing improprieties by sending letters to teaching
hospitals and faculty practice plans primarily in the Philadelphia
area.
The letters say the providers may have billed Medicare for work
done by residents, even though HCFA says it pays for that work
under hospital graduate medical education payments.
Some hospitals without substantial teaching affiliations will be
targeted, says John Foley, a Pennsylvania consultant who helps
hospitals comply with Medicare billing regulations.
The feds also reportedly want academic medical providers to hire
external auditors to scour records to determine how much exposure
there is for attending physician billing, says Foley, with Parente,
Randolph, Orlando, Carey & Associates (see Compliance Strategy).
The U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia would neither confirm
nor deny the existence of the letters.

Case May Be Ripe for Self-Audit

Because documenting false claims for attending physician billing
would be labor-intensive and time-consuming for the government,
this case may be ripe for the type of self-audits for alleged
billing errors done at the government's behest in the Metzinger
Associates case.
Providers in that case agreed to have an independent audit and
submit the findings to the feds. In return, providers will refund
less to the government than they would pay in damages under the
federal False Claims Act.
Almost two months ago, the faculty practice plans at the University
of Pennsylvania struck a deal to pay $30 million to resolve
allegations of attending physician billing fraud lodged by the U.S.
attorney in Philadelphia (HBLS 12/20/95, p. 1).
HCFA says payment for work performed by residents is already
included in graduate medical education payments to hospitals and
faculty practice plans. Attending physicians can only bill Medicare
for work performed by residents when the attending physician is
physically present for "key portions" of the service.
HCFA formalized its position, initially taken in Intermediary
Letter 372, in regulations published in the Dec. 8 Federal
Register.

Whistleblower: Providers BoldIn Device Fraud Practices


The whistleblower in the experimental device false claims
lawsuit said the feds urged him to file it, which may weaken his
case. The feds deny doing so.

The providers who allegedly billed Medicare for experimental
devices knowing it was supposedly illegal were undaunted by the
threat of government retaliation, a former device industry
executive said at a Senate hearing last week.
The man, who is suing some providers on behalf of the government
under the whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act, told the
Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations some providers
allegedly risked patients' lives, tampered with files, and lied on
claims forms to make sure Medicare paid for their work - with
little fear of getting punished. The lawsuit claims providers
improperly billed for experimental devices and related medical
care. His identity remains shielded.
He noted that AMA and AHA, arguing that their members believed HCFA
had no hard-and-fast rule on the experimental device issue,
successfully pressured HHS to change coverage rules "and to get
[the feds] to back off on the investigation." And that, he said,
made some providers bold in the face of the government's warnings
against billing for experimental devices.
An AHA official said there was "a concerted effort on behalf of all
sectors of the health care field to promptly examine the issues
raised by this investigation and try to address them."
HCFA started officially paying for next-generation experimental
medical devices Nov. 1.
The whistleblower, who said he is "involved in the purchase and
billing loop for hospitals' use of experimental medical devices,"
alleged some hospitals and physicians: (1) falsely billed Medicare
for experimental automatic implantable cardiac defibrillators as
FDA-approved pacemakers; (2) billed Medicare for angioplasties when
they really did experimental atherectomies. To cover their tracks,
providers allegedly reinvaded patients' arteries, inserted a cheap
balloon, took an X-ray and put it in the patient file in case a
Medicare auditor checked; (3) removed patient consent forms from
files because they served as evidence the hospitals knew the
procedures were experimental; and (4) reused single-use-only
ablation and electrophysiology catheters.
The whistleblower says he "was asked by the HHS IG and Department
of Justice to come forward as a whistleblower and encouraged to
file a suit under the federal False Claims Act." Given that, the
lawyers defending the hospitals named in the false claims lawsuit
plan to contend the whistleblower is not the originator of the
allegations - a key requirement for winning such cases.
The feds denied asking the whistleblower to sue.

Hospitals Say Blues ContractFacilitates `Network
Leasing'


A silent PPO-like practice is one of a hospital group's
complaints about a new Blue Cross contract the state may review.
The Massachusetts Hospital Assn. has complained to the state about
a Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts contract that
includes something the hospital group says is akin to silent
discounting.

The Blues is offering a new provider contract for HMO, PPO,
indemnity and Medicare risk products.
The state attorney general has promised to look into the contract
provisions, and the state insurance division met with the Blues at
least once on the matter, says Andrew Dreyfus, hospital association
spokesman.
The association questions the legality of certain aspects of the
contract, including alleged:

o       Network leasing provisions that
allow Blue Cross to cut deals with other payers and require
providers to give to other insurers the same terms they give Blue
Cross. Dreyfus says the provision is similar to silent discounting.
In silent discounting, providers unwittingly give discounts to
indemnity patients whose insurers bought a PPO's negotiated
discounts with the providers.
o       Full-line forcing, which means
hospitals allegedly have to participate in all Blue Cross lines.
"The insurer won't let a hospital contract only with indemnity or
MediGap products," Dreyfus says.
o       A termination option that lets the
Blues kill a contract with a hospital if the hospital enters into
an arrangement with non-insurers, like employers.

Despite the complaints, 48 out of 54 hospitals have signed the
contract, notes Bob Brooks, Massachusetts Blue Cross' director of
health services contracting.
No network leasing is planned, and Blue Cross envisions renting its
network only to union health plans that already have third-party
administrative functions but need to rent a provider network, says
Maria Butler, counsel in the law department at the Blues.
Brooks notes that Blue Cross informed hospitals that it reserves
the right to rent its network, with 90 days notice to the hospital.
The hospital can opt out if Blue Cross doesn't live up to its
contractual terms.
Brooks acknowledges the product lines are negotiated all-or-nothing
with hospitals, but notes that hospitals can opt out of any line
without cause. He says the termination option merely lets the
insurer renegotiate rates if a hospital turns into a competitor.
Susan Grakowski, another counsel in the insurer's law department,
says Blue Cross is close to completing negotiations with the rest
of the hospitals. "We had an informational session with the
division of insurance" about the contract, but "we've heard nothing
from the AG's office," she says.

FTC OKs Urology Network;Shows Antitrust Fears Persist


Limiting MD participation to under 30% and selling MD
services for capitation garners a urology network antitrust
approval.

In a deal that shows antitrust anxiety still prompts providers to
seek assurance that even routine deals won't be challenged under
antitrust laws, a Louisiana urology independent physician
association (IPA) got FTC clearance late last month.
Uronet of Louisiana, a limited liability company owned by a group
of New Orleans area urologists, asked the FTC for antitrust
approval to sell their services to managed care plans for
capitation.
The 19 urologist-owners of Uronet make up 22% of the urologists
practicing in the area. Uronet may add up to three more urologists
to the network if managed care plans want extra practice locations
or MDs with privileges at other hospitals. If that happens, the
percentage of urologists in Uronet would reach 26%, but the extra
urologists wouldn't be owners.
Uronet is non-exclusive, so its members could join other networks
and contract with assorted payers. Most of the owners are in
various managed care plans.
Uronet will use an agent, Physicians Health Corp., to negotiate
capitated contracts, which Uronet's medical director will approve.
Each member will decide separately whether to participate in the
contract. Members don't have to participate in any contract.
In a staff advisory opinion, Bob Leibenluft, assistant director of
the FTC Bureau of Competition, told Uronet it appears to qualify
for antitrust immunity under the FTC-Justice Department antitrust
safety zone for physician networks. The safety zone limits
non-exclusive networks to 30% of the MDs in the market.
Uronet also passed FTC antitrust muster because the MDs share
financial risk through capitation.

Take These Steps to Avoid Medicare Payment Suspension


Losing Medicare revenue even temporarily can be financially
devastating, so it's worth taking the "ounce of prevention is worth
a pound of cure" approach to preventing carriers and fiscal
intermediaries from suspending payments.
Medicare contractors may suspend provider or supplier payments to
recover alleged overpayments or for suspected fraud (HBLS 12/20/95,
p. 7).
Washington lawyer Irv Cohen recommends taking these steps to help
avoid situations that may prompt Medicare contractors to suspend
Medicare payments:
(1) Have a sound in-house claims processing policy, including
well-trained staff. "Most mistakes are made by staff who don't
understand the fine differences between what Medicare covers and
what Medicare doesn't cover," says Cohen, with Fulbright &
Jaworski.
(2) Carefully monitor changes in policies and other announcements
from Medicare carriers.
(3) Attend carrier training programs.
(4) If you're very risk-averse, avoid product lines, such as
incontinence supplies, that are under intense scrutiny for fraud
and abuse. One way to keep up on the government's investigative hot
buttons: Read the HHS inspector general's annual workplan, which
describes what will be targeted.
(5) Immediately respond to disallowances. Don't just write off a
minor disallowance without checking it out. It could be a tipoff to
future, larger disallowances. For example, a disallowance might
alert providers or suppliers to a coverage change that means
Medicare will pay for a medical supply only under one diagnosis
code.
(6) Promptly comply with carrier requests for more information
about a claim. "I've seen several suppliers not respond to the
carrier, [writing the disallowance off] as just one unpaid claim,"
Cohen says. "The suppliers [faced] a major disallowance or an
investigation because they failed to respond" to the carrier.
(7) Check whether an inquiry comes from the carrier's utilization
review or anti-fraud unit. If a fraud probe seems underway, notify
employees of how they should respond to contacts by investigators,
which may be made at their homes at night. Your lawyer can help
with this issue.
(8) Be on guard for unusual delays in Medicare reimbursement. "It
may be a sign of a prepayment review or other kind of review,"
Cohen says. "Early intervention gets the money flowing [again]
sooner - before you're on the verge of bankruptcy."
(9) Do internal audits to make sure billing practices are on the up
and up.
(10) Install a corporate compliance plan to prevent and detect
fraud and abuse, preferably before it gets out of hand, Cohen
suggests.

Try Team Method in Audits for Attending MD Billing Errors


With the feds ready to pounce on teaching hospitals or faculty
practice plans for improper billing for attending physician
services, academic providers should do a self-audit to get a handle
on legal vulnerability - and forensic accountants may be the
ingredient that makes the audit process work.
Millions of dollars are at stake, as evidenced by the $30 million
false-claims settlement the government struck with the faculty
practice plans at the University of Pennsylvania. The government
accused the providers of billing Medicare for attending physician
services when they were not physically present for work performed
by their residents (HBLS 12/20/95, p. 1).
Experts recommend you have outside counsel hire independent
auditors to do the audit.
"When you start to self-audit, make sure you have the right team
assembled to do this work," says consultant John Foley, with the
Wilkes-Barre, Pa., offices of Parente, Randolph, Orlando, Carey &
Associates.
A major player on the team is the forensic accountant who analyzes
financial data to help resolve disputes, such as alleged fraudulent
billing, business insurance claims and contract disputes.
"Everyone tends to send in nursing personnel or people familiar
with medical records or coding, but we don't believe that's the
largest part of the engagement. The largest part should be forensic
accountants," Foley contends.
Forensic accountants will meet with university personnel to outline
the work plan for the project. A proposed workplan should be
reviewed by the HHS inspector general, Foley advises.
"The IG has to bless any workplan in advance. One would not want
the firm"to do a lot of work and find out at the end of the day the
workplan was insufficient," he says.

Sample Used to Figure Error Rate

The forensic accountants will select a method for determining how
many errors were made in attending physician billing.
Once a sample selection method is set, statisticians will select
the claims that will be subject to the methodology.
The sample is then returned to forensic accountants, who work with
hospital staff on the whole review, Foley says.
Then coders, nurses and medical records staff will "wade through
the documentation to determine whether there's adequate
documentation" to justify the claims submitted for attending
physician services, he says.
If not, the sample's error rate is extrapolated to the entire
population of claims to calculate an overall error rate and
determine how much money must be refunded to Medicare. The final
report is given to the hospital's counsel to negotiate a settlement
with the feds.

RISK-SHARED OUTSOURCING WILL SOAR AS BUILD-OR-
BUY SOLUTION

By Sharon McEachern
Outsourcing is becoming an increasingly viable alternative for more
and more hospitals and health care systems faced with the build-or-
buy dilemma. And everyone is facing this dilemma with every health
care delivery service they offer that is not a core competency.
Caught in the squeeze between mandated state and federal reforms
and the demands of insurance carriers, providers are analyzing all
likely areas for outsourcing opportunities--not just the traditional
housekeeping and food service.

The First Look At VHA Research Data On Outsourcing Hospitals

And although the majority (61%) of hospitals currently outsourcing
have flat price contracts with their outsource providers, most say,
now that they have some outsourcing experience, that they prefer
future contracts to be shared risk (39%) and performance-based
(30%), according to VHA.

The Irving, Texas-based hospital cooperative recently conducted an
extensive research project on outsourcing, interviewing CEOs,
COOs and CFOs from a cross section of its 1,200 hospital
members. Although VHA won't share this data with its members
formally until its first quarter '96 report, we have preliminary data
and can offer a preview of VHA's findings in this market memo.
(Bar graphs illustrating this data appear throughout this article.)

Extrapolating from its research survey, VHA found that a whopping
75% of its hospital and system members are outsourcing some
function. Most recent surveys indicate the number of outsourcing
hospitals today is around 40%.

Benefits Of Outsourcing

Asked to identify the financial benefits of outsourcing for their
hospitals, 84% of respondents listed lower overall costs, 14%
identified reduced required capitalization, 11% answered with
improved rate of returns and 5% said higher productivity.

Hospital administrators revealed key nonfinancial benefits of
outsourcing for their institutions as being access to or acquisition of
staff expertise (63%), enhanced quality (24%), ability to better serve
employees/patients (23%) and new technology (14%).

What are the disadvantages of outsourcing? Based on their
experience, not expectations, those who were currently outsourcing
said the disadvantages are poor performance/subcontractor (38%),
lack of control (34%) and increased costs (34%).

Some Unexpected Results

It is ironic that more than one-third cited increased costs as a
disadvantage of outsourcing when the number one reason for
outsourcing, listed by 84% as an advantage, was lower cost. There
is truth in both--the explanations for them and ways to protect your
institution from unwanted outsourcing surprises are soon to follow.

Another unexpected finding from the VHA study involves a
difference between independent hospitals vs. integrated systems.
Forty percent of the systems indicated they had more problems with
increased costs when outsourcing than the nonsystem hospitals, of
which 29% cited increased costs. The reasons for this variable are,
as yet, uncertain.

"Clearly, there is a focus to outsource whatever is considered not to
be a core capability," said Denise Rubin, VHA's director of
improvement services, a new R&D unit, looking for risk-sharing
potentials for member hospitals. "They want to focus their resources
behind reducing costs and increasing quality in the clinical area,
where outsourcing will be growing by leaps and bounds."

Although it is very difficult to achieve, the successful outsourcers
will be those who are aggressive in tying the outsourcing charge to a
per-member-per-month fee, said Rubin. Additionally, those
outsourcers who are adept at handling the emotional issues will
position themselves more successfully than those who continue to
ignore this challenge.

Outsourcing Is Both Financial And Emotional

"Outsourcing is a very good financial decision for an institution,
which can achieve significant cost reductions," she said. "But it's
not merely financial. Outsourcing is a very emotional issue, we've
discovered. There is a huge fear factor with outsourcing, specifically
from hospital employees."

To respond to those fears, you need to develop a strong transition
plan with a special focus on the labor component and all of those
ramifications.

BJC Health Gets Back Millions In Annualized Savings

In St. Louis, the BJC Health System considers outsourcing a very
viable option if it adds value to the organization. As cost pressures
continue to increase, BJC is taking an ever more critical look at what
outsourcing can bring to its system, said Jim Francis, vice president
of materiel management.

To illustrate the savings BJC has accrued from outsourcing, its food
service contract produced $5.8 million in annualized savings and its
medical/surgical distribution contracts is on track to achieve $4
million in annualized savings in its first year.

Reasons To Outsource

"We're looking for ways we can rapidly reduce operating costs and
labor costs, improve productivity, bring higher quality and service
to the organization, address existing problems and bring new
expertise and resources--all potentials with outsourcers," said
Francis.

In the last two years, BJC has looked at eight areas for outsourcing
opportunities. Those that have been outsourced include food
service, waste management, transportation services around its
metropolitan St. Louis campus and distribution services for
pharmaceutical and dietary supplies. Currently it's studying
outsourcing its linen and laundry services, forms, printing and
copying services and clinical and biomedical engineering. It decided
to consolidate and manage internally its housekeeping services.

The most important issues that need to be addressed before you even
embark on an outsourcing analysis is identifying the need for change
within your organization, recognizing that change is necessary to
achieve your goals, building the commitment around that
recognition, and communicating that thoroughly throughout your
organization.

It Shouldn't Be A Management-only Decision

"I don't think outsourcing decisions can be made by senior
management exclusively," said Francis. "They must involve the
end-users, the recipients of the service. It's important they be
included in the process of evaluating outsourcers."

G. Scott Dillon, chief development officer of Atlanta-based
outsourcer Transcend Services, said outsourcing is a way to get
economic benefits that you would typically get from reengineering,
but quicker.

Macro VS. Micro

"Outsourcing in health care is increasing tremendously. It provides
an opportunity for hospital CEOs to focus on the more macro
issues, the strategic planning, and allows an outsourcing provider to
focus on the micro issues, the day-to-day issues, which they can do
better," said Dillon, whose company contracts to manage accounts
receivables and medical records.

The recent fast growth is particularly evident in both business and
clinical outsourcing, including a 40% growth in information
technology outsourcing, 30% growth in data management
outsourcing and 13% increase in clinical outsourcing, advised
Dillon.

Loss Of Control Fear Is A Key Barrier

"A key barrier to outsourcing is the fear of loss of control," said
Dillon. "There's always the misperception that the hospital can do it
better than an outsider. Another misperception is that there may be
an extra layer of cost, but obviously the outsourcer needs to make a
profit in there."

From the hospital perspective, the way to overcome the fears and
barriers is to have a clear strategy, including realistically achievable
expectations, measurable conditions, and pricing and performance
goals based on responsibilities and risks of both parties. Selecting
an outsourcing company as a partner, rather than a vendor, is vital if
you want to shift or share in the risks, as is upfront discovery and
analysis of an outsourcer's technical, financial and management
capabilities.

The biggest stumbling block for hospitals that are considering
outsourcing is "personal pride," according to Mike Hamilton, Costa
Mesa, Calif.-based national director of health care for KPMG Peat
Marwick. "There seems to be a feeling of failure if you have to bring
in someone from outside. Another stumbling block is that people are
reluctant to let go and are anxious to hold on to how business has
always been provided."

What You Need To Know When Considering Outsourcing

Hamilton's top five list of things health care institutions need to
know when considering outsourcing include:

+ Make sure you're comparing apples to apples--that the cost you
think you're giving up, eliminating, should be comparable in nature
to the services you're going to be receiving.

+ Have an open mind relative to others' ways of doing things.

+ Be certain that the outsourcing vendor has tangible deliverables
and that performance can be easily assessed.

+ Services delivered by your institution should be enhanced. A good
outsourcing vendor should be able to become a seamless part of the
product that is delivered to the public. What the public sees
shouldn't be any different, whether you're doing it or someone else
is providing it.

+ Treat your outsourcing provider as a partner and not a vendor.
Partners tend to drive and create more value for each other than a
vendor relationship.

Great Misconception

"The greatest misconception that hospital folks have is that
outsource folks will give away the store for a contract--that they will
do it for little or no profit," said Hamilton. "The true perspective is
that outsourcers may be able to do it for less than hospitals are
currently paying and still make a handsome profit."

"Another frequent misconception is that most hospital administrators
tend to think they can get in and out relatively easily--if it doesn't
work out, we can go back to how it used to be. But to have a
partnership relationship, you need to have a long-term contract, at
least three to five years. Because, as service becomes more blended
into yours, to change it again makes it much more difficult."

The often-mentioned 90-day just-cause provisions are valid
contracting tools allowing escape. However, they should be used
only in the extreme situation, where philosophies and operating
styles can't be synchronized. The 90-day just-cause and year-to-year
contract is indicative of the old vendor relationship. Remember--
outsource providers will invest first in their longer contracts.

Within the acute care hospital market, there are between 10,000 and
11,000 outsourcing contracts in place, "and that number's growing
every day," said Keith Goding, executive vice president and chief
development officer for RehabCare Group. The St. Louis-based
outsourcer of rehabilitation and physical therapy programs contracts
with more than 100 hospitals in 24 states.

An Outsourcer Lists Tactical Reasons To Outsource

The tactical reasons for hospitals to outsource, as cited by Goding,
are to:

+ Control operating expenses--Across the board, in all industry, the
average cost savings last year from outsourcing was 9% and a 15%
increase in capacity and quality according to the Outsourcing
Institute.

+ Make capital funds available--You reduce need to invest capital
funds in non-core business functions.

+ Cash infusion--Transfer of assets from customer to the provider.

+ Gain access to resources that are not available internally.

+ Quickly gain control or improve management of departments that
are essentially out of control--not performing well, difficulty with
quality, staff turnover, financial performance that's gone down the
tubes.

"If you've just lost key staff in an area, the most efficient thing to do
is outsource it rather than the painful rebuilding internally," said
Goding. "It brings a new perspective to the table, new sources of
creativity, and outsourcers are not in that operating mode that has
self-fulfilling prophecies--like 'this department never makes
money.' It's tough to get a balanced perspective when you're so
close."

Focus With Outsourcers Should Be Performance Criteria

First define your institution's goals and its competencies. What are
the core competencies that your institution does best? What areas are
not centers of excellence, where a third party, a contract
management company might be able to provide more focus, bring
more resources, more expertise to the table and in the end manage
that function better?

When you are talking to an outsourcing company, the focus should
always be on performance criteria. You need to quantify what
performance you are looking for, what performance the outsourcing
vendor will be judged by and how performance will affect their
compensation.

Increasingly, the relationship between hospitals and outsourcers is
performance driven. It means the quality of services being provided
are measured in several ways--outcomes measurement, the clinical
outcome that is achieved for an individual patient or group of
patients, and satisfaction measurement of both patients who have
gone through the treatment and medical staff who've had interaction
with the outsourcing clinical vendor.

And remember, performance related to cost is a two-sided coin--
expense control and revenue generation.

You Have To Partner To Share The Risk

"The hospital and its outsourcing provider should be in the same
boat together," said Goding. "If risk is shared, both the up and
downside, that allows everyones' interest, intentions and motives to
be in alignment. It makes for partnerships. We think that the
partnership arrangement is the way to do business in today's
environment--not the traditional vendor relationship, based on flat
fees regardless of performance."

Catholic Health Care West, a 23-hospital system based in San
Francisco, outsources traditional services, including laundries, food
service, biomed programs, equipment repair and distribution of
materials.

"With the way the cost environment is going today, you have to
consider more outsourcing," said Mike Bergdorf, corporate director
of materials. "Hospitals still have not been subject to the tremendous
cost cutting that they will face in the future--from both insurance
carriers and the federal government. Outsourcing is one of the
options that you need to explore."

However, you must carefully assess the risks to outsourcing, too,
cautioned Bergdorf. Its biggest risk, in his opinion, is that once you
outsource a service, it's very difficult to bring it back inside. Often
the people needed to run the operations have left the hospital and
gone on to other jobs, and space might have been given up for other
programs that would have to be uprooted, producing a raft of new
problems and costs.

Spell Out Quality Specifications And Access To Data

Quality must be contractually specified, and some action spelled out,
if those quality standards are not maintained.

"You need to be careful that any outsource program fits in with the
overall focus and strategy of your hospital," said Bergdorf. "And
you don't want to outsource something where you lose all your
data. You must make a provision in any contract that you get access
to the information that comes from that outsourced function."

A stumbling block that hospitals trip over is not creating an
outsource contract that stipulates all the expectations and protects the
hospital, reiterated Marty Holzman, a Philadelphia-based manager
with Coopers & Lybrand.

Stipulate All Expectations In Outsource Contracts

As a buyer of outsource services, you need to create a detailed
document--not just accept the proposal that's given to you by the
outsource firm, but one that protects the interest of the hospital, he
said. It also must provide for incentives for improvements and
savings that match the goals and objectives of the hospital.

"I've seen too many outsourcing agreements just be renewed year
after year, without a rigorous evaluation of how the agreement now
compares to either other outsource firms or what the hospital could
do on its own," said Holzman.

The renewal evaluations should be a team process including people
from finance, patient care, materials management and others whom
outsourcing impacts, so that it's looked at from a variety of
perspectives.

With the increasing capitation agreements, you must build into
contracts the right level of risk sharing and controls to ensure cost
savings and quality of services. This is particularly important
because the outsourcing firm has an incentive to just cut costs and a
tendency to reduce quality. For example, if you have a pharmacy
outsource contract, it should include controls that ensure availability
of services 24 hours a day and guarantee delivery of the first dose of
a drug within 30 minutes.

Outsourcing possibilities have expanded quickly, and you, too, need
to stretch in your consideration of them for the survival of your
hospital or system.

PUBLISH CAPITATION RATES, HMO PREMIUMS

By Donald E.L. Johnson
Hospitals, integrated systems, large medical groups and managed
care organizations should publish their capitated rates and insurance
premiums and eliminate much of the contracting secrecy that is
distorting the health care market.

A favorite ploy used by HMOs is to require subcontractors to keep
their contract terms confidential. This is a mistake for providers.
Secrecy favors health maintenance organizations and preferred
provider organizations and lets them give different deals to
competing providers. Secrecy also allows providers to give different
deals to competing HMOs, but HMOs know the market better than
providers and are less likely to be taken advantage of by providers.

HMOs Have Information Advantage

At this point, a few powerful HMOs and PPOs have tremendous
negotiating advantages over providers, because there is an
oversupply of specialists and hospital beds in most markets.

In addition, because the chains are in many markets, they know
what they can get away with better than small medical groups and
integrated health care systems do.

Also, hospitals already publish room rates and disclose their average
charges per patient day. And their costs are widely available to
managed care organizations and large employers from Medicare cost
reports, and HMO's costs and premiums already are published
periodically. So publishing capitation rates and average premiums
would be just the next step toward full disclosure and more uniform
pricing in health care.

In other commodity and financial markets, producers publish their
prices and give them to various publishers such as The Wall Street
Journal, which uses them in its cash markets table on the
commodities page and in various financial tables.

Lehman Bros., Merrill Lynch and other industry leaders publish
their prices, which are used as benchmarks for the industry.
Contracts are written based on the banks' published prime lending
rates.

Potential Leaders: Columbia, Mayo

Columbia/HCA, Mayo Clinic, Kaiser and Cigna, to mention a few
organizations, all have the potential of establishing themselves as
national and market leaders by publishing their prices, or "prime
rates." This would establish them as the market leaders and would
allow them to test price changes quickly as their costs change.

What published prices do for sellers is establish the market price.
Then, competitors can offer discounts from the market price or
charge premiums. A bank, for example, may charge one point over
prime plus a 1% transaction fee on a 36-month asset loan.

When there are published prices, buyers' expectations are more
realistic and there is less price cutting and relatively little
overcharging by suppliers. Everyone knows the going auto loan
rate, the 30-year mortgage rate and the price of soybean meal.

Like it or not, employers and HMOs are treating health care services
as commodities, and they should be priced accordingly.

Thus, in local markets, large medical groups and integrated systems
should establish themselves as market leaders by publishing their
capitated rates for primary care physicians, specialists,
pharmaceuticals and other services. The insurers already are getting
such information from various database purveyors, including
Medirisk in Atlanta. The important challenge for providers is to
make sure that all providers and employers have the same
information as HMOs, PPOs and other insurers.

Medicare Becoming Highest Payer

Pricing secrecy in managed care contracting is one reason that
Medicare is one of the highest--if not the highest payers--in some
markets where managed care organizations are demanding and
getting 20% to 70% discounts from providers. Providers and
diagnostic centers that are desperate for business or out of touch
with their markets are giving their services away and dragging prices
down not only for themselves but for all providers.

This industry secret hit the cover of the influential political journal,
The New Republic (December 11, pp. 20), and undoubtedly
influenced the negotiations between Congress and the president over
the Medicare Preservation Act of 1995.

What the politicians probably concluded and will decide in 1996 is
that if Medicare can be the best payer in some markets, it probably is
paying too much. Their solution will be to cut Medicare payments to
providers instead of slowing the rate of growth of payments over the
next seven years.

Medicare Payment Schemes Will Change

They also are likely to conclude that if HMOs can get such good
prices for commercial enrollees, they probably can do the same for
Medicare enrollees. As a result, the politicians will change the
payment scheme for Medicare risk contractors so that they won't be
paid as much as they are under the current program.

This will work to the advantage of the rich, established HMOs that
have billions in reserves and no debt. It will hurt new provider
organizations and provider sponsored organizations that are trying to
break into the metropolitan Medicare risk contracting markets. POs
and PSOs in more rural areas may not be hurt, because politicians
are inclined to protect them and their rural hospitals.

How Providers Will React To Price Pressure

Meanwhile, deep discounting by hospitals, medical groups, solo
practitioners and integrated systems will roil the commercial
managed care markets. Hospitals and small multi-hospital systems
will protect themselves by:

+ Joining larger multi-unit providers and provider sponsored
organizations that can resist price pressures.

+ Creating integrated health care systems anchored by large medical
groups that are capitated.

+ Buying and closing smaller competitors.

+ Encouraging small physician groups to consolidate.

+ Pushing physicians harder to reduce utilization and improve
outcomes.

+ Publishing prices so competitors know the market.

+ Restructuring access to reduce costs.

+ Refusing to contract with the most price-conscious HMOs; being
willing to lose a few contracts.

+ Making greater use of nurse and physician extenders.

+ Negotiating better deals with suppliers.

+ Standardizing more medical and surgical supplies.

+ Buying money-saving products and services regardless of
whether they are covered by group purchasing contracts.

+ Making a big public issue of HMOs' pricing demands and cutting
the most visible and popular services in response to those demands.

+ Selling quality.

+ Pushing for full pricing disclosure legislation.

Some HMOs Will Pay More

Some HMOs will be smart enough to cut costs by recruiting the best
providers instead of paying the lowest professional fees and
capitated rates.

They'll look for well-managed hospitals and integrated systems that
minimize utilization, as large medical groups are doing on the West
Coast. And they'll hook up with large medical groups that will
control utilization on their own without requiring much
administrative time or expenses from the HMO.

Unfortunately, the largest HMOs, with 50% to 75% of all HMO
enrollees, have the leverage to win big price concessions from
providers, and they are exercising their power in many markets.
Smaller HMOs and integrated systems don't have as much clout,
which puts them at price disadvantages in markets where they are
not the largest players. But where they are the largest HMOs, small
HMOs can put a lot of pressure on providers' rates.

This is why it will benefit even smaller integrated systems and
medical groups that are the largest providers in their market to
become the price leaders by publishing their capitated rates as well
as their room rates and office visit fees.

MOORE REGIONAL HOSPITAL IN GOLF-HISTORIC
PINEHURST BREAKS SUCCESS RECORDS WITH ITS
HEALTH AND FITNESS CENTER

The 397-bed Moore Regional Hospital is based in Pinehurst, N.C.,
a resort community whose citizens--60% of whom are retired--call
their town "the home of golf in America." As one of its first visible
signs that it is converting from a "sick care" institution to an
integrated "health care" system, Moore Regional Hospital
established a comprehensive health and fitness center. The $6.7
million facility was designed to integrate health promotion, wellness
and fitness activities with cardiac and physical rehabilitation and
community health.

"Strategically, the hospital entered this business to begin managing
the health status of its population, to create a new revenue source
and to create a new image for the health system," said Robert
Boone, vice president of professional services.

With unprecedented success in its opening membership, the new
52,000-square foot facility opened its doors in January, with 3,600
members. Membership has grown to a current 4,200--with more
than 900 on its waiting list. Some 27% of Pinehurst's population are
members, and they pay an average of $38 per month for
membership. Where the average age of members in most hospital-
based wellness centers is mid-30s, Pinehurst's older retired citizenry
has produced an average member age of 53 years. The center's year-
to-date turnover rate is less than 11%. And although it is still too
early to predict with certainty financial performance, it appears the
facility will break even within the first 15 months of operation.

Programming is offered for all ages ranging from six months
through geriatrics, with specific activities for arthritics, pre- and
postnatal fitness, diabetics, cardiac and physical rehabilitation,
medically directed weight loss and personalized intervention based
on an individual's current fitness status or medical diagnosis. The
health and fitness center also offers free community health lectures
monthly, with an average attendance of 70 people.

Information obtained from health risk appraisals and fitness
evaluations, offered to every member upon joining the facility, are
stored in a database. Additionally, the hospital is beginning to
aggressively pursue obtaining health risk appraisals, through the
corporate members, the occupational health program, community
health outreach program and community health fairs, on as many
people as possible within the service area.

"By obtaining and constantly updating the database, we will have a
statistically valid measure of the health status of the population it
serves and a tool to measure the societal impact of programs it may
offer," said Boone.

For corporate customers, who comprise 30% of membership,
periodic reports are run that show the health risk reduction for their
employees participating in wellness and fitness programs. These
results can be translated into reduced sick time, reduced time lost at
work to illness and injury, increased productivity and dollars saved.
The product is customized for each client by looking at the most
frequently encountered work site injuries and specifically designing
classes or interventions designed to reduce the number and severity
of workplace injuries.

CHICAGO SEVEN FORM ONE OF CITY'S LARGEST
INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE NETWORKS

Seven major health care organizations have joined to form the
Unified HealthCare Network, becoming one of the largest managed
health care organizations in the Chicago area.

Founding members of the new network are Loyola University
Medical Center, Resurrection Health Care Corp., Saint Bernard
Hospital and Health Care Center, Saint Francis Hospital of
Evanston, Saint James Hospital and Health Centers and Saint Mary
of Nazareth Hospital Center.

Formation of the network, with initial committed capital of $33
million, will enable them to contract as a single unit with HMOs,
PPOs and employers to provide medical and wellness services. As
part of the agreement, the network partners also are forming a
regional physicians hospital organization (PHO) which will enable
physicians on their hospital medical staffs to participate in the
managed care contracting.

The Unified network partners own seven hospitals with more than
2,900 beds. In metropolitan Chicago, the network's partners have
total assets of more than $1.5 billion, an annual revenue stream of
more than $1.1 billion, more than 14,000 employees, 2,300
physicians. The network partners treat more than 1 million patients a
year in Chicago.

"The formation of this network is not a hospital preservation
strategy," said Burton Vanderlaan, M.D., president and CEO of the
new network. "Rather, it is a milestone initiative creating a fully
integrated health care delivery system focused on meeting the health
care needs of the communities it serves, and that is the next major
step in the evolution of managed care."

COLUMBIA-PRESBYTERIAN MEDICAL CENTER OFFERS
PLUSH GUEST ACCOMMODATIONS

The McKeen Pavilion--the five-year-old plush facility at Columbia-
Presbyterian Medical Center in New York--has begun offering
$150-per-night guest accommodations for family members and
visitors of patients. The amenities include a concierge, room service,
continental breakfast, valet parking and a complimentary high tea.

Patients who are ensconced at McKeen Pavilion pay $250 per night
for a standard hospital room and $325 nightly for the premium
room, which includes flowers, a fruit basket, robe and slippers, and
a river view.

A year ago, Columbia-Presbyterian opened overnight
accommodations for parents at their children's hospital, which was
very successful, particularly for parents of critically ill children. The
fee was a nominal $25 per night, subsidized by outside
contributions. They started with seven rooms and thought they'd fill
maybe four per night. But, they ended up using 11 rooms per night
and often times had waiting lists.

"We knew when we opened the facility that we'd be meeting a need,
but honestly had very little idea how extensive that need was and
were overwhelmed by the response," said Karyn Schwab, executive
director of the babies' and children's hospital.

In response to a continuing need of family members, under stress
and often traveling from around the world for care at the quaternary
care center, Columbia-Presbyterian decided to offer rooms with
additional amenities and pamper the patient and family.

"The marketplace has gotten much more competitive in New York,
and everyone is looking for creative ways of meeting needs and
attracting patients," said Schwab. "We've been pleasantly surprised
by the response. We only advertised to our medical staff, and within
two days all of our rooms were booked and we had a waiting list."

For more information, call Schwab at 212/305-7112.

HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS URGED TO ADOPT FIVE
STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES

"Health care organizations must adopt an action plan to safeguard
and ensure affordable quality medical care in an environment where
the federal government's role will be greatly constrained, diminished
or eliminated," said Daniel P. Bourque, senior vice president, VHA
information and research.

In their 1996 environmental assessment, VHA and Deloitte &
Touche recommend five actions for health care organizations to
prevent an escalating medical crisis. According to the report, the
1996 Environmental Assessment of the Health Care System in the
United States, organizations must:

+ Broaden their vision to service multiple customers with varying
needs;

+ Insist on vibrant, integrated delivery systems;

+ Improve financial performance and operating results;

+ Define and monitor quality outcomes throughout the continuum of
care;

+ Focus on improving core processes to offer better services at
lower costs.

The report analyzes a large body of primary research that addresses
all facets of the U.S. health care system and its participants: patients,
clinicians, providers, managed care organizations, insurers and
government. The assessment offers both short- and long-term
critical action recommendations and is a benchmark used annually
by strategic planners.

VHA urges providers to move toward the "accountable care phase"
of integration, where providers' incentives are aligned with
purchasers and insurers and there is full integration between
providers and the community.

Pointing to the climbing inflation rate for hospitals--5.5% in 1994
compared with overall medical care inflation's 4.9% growth, the
lowest rate of growth since 1973--Merlin Olson, a partner with
Deloitte & Touche, said:

"Despite hospitals' energetic efforts to trim their inpatient
overcapacity, the fact remains that we still have twice the number of
beds we need. Moreover, overcapacity weakens the bargaining
position of providers as they face off against employers and other
purchasers who are less willing to subsidize underpayments by
government and other low-margin payers."

THE REVOLT AGAINST THE ONE-DAY STAY

By Beth Ginzinger
The hospital care of women during the birthing process has changed
dramatically over the last several years. Health care facilities are
being created to reflect this new attitude toward childbirth by
providing a homelike environment; allowing the infant, mother, and
significant other to stay together; and minimizing transfers during
the hospital stay.

Most Prevalent Admission Is Childbirth

Ironically, the attitude that childbirth is a natural process has also
fueled one of the most hotly debated health care issues: the length of
stay for new mothers and babies. With 4 million deliveries a year,
childbirth is the most prevalent cause of hospital admission,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Not
surprisingly, length of stay for normal vaginal deliveries is being
scrutinized by payers seeking to minimize costs.

It is particularly difficult in this time of uncertainty to plan for
obstetrical facilities. Significant changes in length of stay can have a
dramatic impact on facilities, particularly for large-volume services
with a single-room maternity care concept. And yet, many
institutions are facing situations where renovation or replacement of
their obstetrical services is imperative to their ability to negotiate for
managed care contracts and remain marketable to their physician and
patient constituents.

Economic Line Between Wellness And Clinical Risk

Many people, particularly clinicians and patients, feel that we have
crossed the line between a wellness approach that is also
economically sound, and an economic approach that is clinically
unsafe. The recent study completed at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical
Center validated clinical concerns as they relate to newborns and
early discharge. The study team evaluated nearly 15,000 infants
from New Hampshire by reviewing readmission rates and ER visits
for neonates sent home within 48 hours of birth. They concluded
that infants discharged early are at increased risk. The most common
reasons for readmission and ER visits included jaundice,
pneumonia, and gastroenteritis. They also concluded, by comparing
costs of early discharge vs. longer hospital stays, that early
discharge, although clinically questionable, is a cost-effective
approach. According to the study, the balance between clinical
issues and cost-effectiveness appears to be a well-developed follow-
up program either using a home health approach or a scheduled
return visit.

There has also been considerable discussion about the impact of the
reduced length of stay on mothers. Patient satisfaction surveys
indicate that mothers perceive that their care is less than adequate,
with particular emphasis on the lack of time that the nurses spend
with them. Nurses express concerns that they do not have sufficient
time to educate and evaluate psychosocial issues that may need to be
addressed.

Hospitals Are Caught In The Crossfire

A number of legislative actions have been introduced recently
mandating the option for a 48-hour length of stay for new mothers
and neonates, based on the Dartmouth-Hitchcock study and
guidelines from the National College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists and the American College of Pediatricians. Early
discharge is allowed with certain criteria, including clinical standards
and well-defined follow-up care programs. Legislation has already
passed in Maryland, New Jersey and Massachusetts and is pending
in California, New York and Pennsylvania. This legislation places
the hospital in the middle of the crossfire. Based on study findings,
clinician pressures and an increasingly litigious society, many
hospital administrators feel compelled to support a two-day length of
stay. However, with continued pressure to decrease costs in the era
of managed care, and with obstetrical admissions contributing to a
significant number of patient days in a relatively healthy patient
population, length of stay is a prime target for decreasing resource
utilization.

Where will the pendulum stop in the length of stay debate? And will
it start to swing again in a few years? With an expected life of at
least twenty years, a long-range obstetrical facility development
strategy is needed to weather changing variables. For hospitals
facing renovation or new construction of their obstetrical facilities,
the answer is to plan flexible space and concentrate on two major
approaches: Employ the labor-delivery-recovery-postpartum
(LDRPlus) concept to eliminate use of single-room maternity care
for extended-stay patients, and provide adequate triage/holding
space.

Because of the random nature of arrivals to the obstetrical suite,
determining the appropriate number of birthing rooms is a
challenging task. Since actual workloads fluctuate from month to
month, week to week and day to day, use of a daily average for
facility planning, calculated from monthly or yearly total workload
data, results in a rather marked understatement of space needs. A
small-volume service (less than 1,000 births) may require twice the
number of birthing rooms to accommodate the peak than required
for the average. Considering the additional the impact of a one-day
vs. a two-day length of stay, and the planning range may be as wide
as 200%. Alternatively, planning for the busiest day of the year
results in severely underused facilities, with these beds frequently
either empty or used for postpartum patients, and the high-tech
characteristics of the birthing rooms used only a fraction of the time.

LDRPlus Is The Key

The LDRPlus concept, a mix of birthing rooms and ante/postpartum
rooms, is recommended as the most cost-effective and flexible
approach. Low-risk patients with good prenatal care, who are
receptive to education programs and have no major socioeconomic
problems, are targeted prior to delivery as candidates for a 24-hour
length of stay in a birthing room. For patients who do not fit the
criteria for a one-day length of stay, it is not an appropriate use of
resources to maintain that patient in a birthing room for their entire
occupancy. These patients should be transferred to a postpartum bed
for a longer stay after their recovery period in a birthing room.

The goal is to have all vaginal deliveries occur in a birthing room
and use the birthing rooms as labor/delivery/recovery/postpartum
areas for patients who have a high probability of being discharged
within 24 hours or when census permits. Other patients will be
transferred to private postpartum rooms. During peak times, a high
proportion of the patients will be transferred. This approach
maximizes use of high-cost birthing rooms while providing a
homelike atmosphere for all patients and cost-effective utilization of
resources. A well-planned women/infants center provides intrinsic
flexibility to accommodate peaks and valleys throughout the year as
well as typical forecasting inaccuracies.

Triage/Holding Space Is Key To Flexibility

Providing sufficient triage/holding space is crucial for obstetrical
facilities that must handle wide fluctuations in workload. The triage
area is used to regulate the flow of patients into the larger and more
expensive birthing rooms during peak periods, much as the
provision of a minimal number of postpartum beds allows selected
patients to be moved out of the birthing rooms more rapidly during
peak periods.

The average length of stay in a birthing room prior to delivery
should be between 10 and 12 hours. If the stay exceeds this range,
patients are probably being admitted prior to experiencing active
labor, often because no triage/holding facilities are available for
assessment. Once admitted into a birthing room, it is often difficult
to send patients home who are not in active labor. Also, at peak
times when the unit is at capacity, if the labor or birthing rooms are
the only available space for a laboring patient, the low-risk, 24-hour
postpartum patient will have to be transferred.

Triage/holding space can also be used for common prenatal testing
(nonstress tests, ultrasounds, etc.). In addition, this space may be
used as a return visit assessment area for those patients discharged
within 24 hours. Finally, it is important to allocate appropriate
resources to prenatal education and care for patients who are eligible
for a 24-hour length of stay. Patients will have better clinical
outcomes and a better view of their experience if they are well
educated and well prepared.

As the pace of change accelerates in the health care industry,
hospitals must continue to balance patient expectations with payer
demands. The LDRPlus approach combined with adequate
triage/holding areas is the best solution for hospitals struggling to
plan obstetrical facilities during the 24-hour length of stay debate.

by failure to obtain routine clinical preventive services to detect life-
threatening conditions, according to the findings of a recent study by
UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, funded by The
Commonwealth Fund.

Study findings are based on data gathered from more than 25,000
women as part of the 1991 National Health Survey and its
supplement.

More than one-third of women, ages 40 and over, had not received a
clinical breast exam or mammogram in the past two years. The
majority of women in the study were not queried about smoking,
diet, exercise, alcohol and drug use during their last medical
checkup. Yet three in five women, age 18 and over, reported risky
behavior in one of more of these areas.

Early detection of cervical cancer through the use of the Pap test has
resulted in a 40% reduction in invasive cervical cancer during the
past 40 years. Despite this proven effectiveness, 43% of women
have not been screened in the past year.

Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring cancer among
women, and the stage at which it is diagnosed is a major predictor of
survival. Yet, among women over age 40, four out of 10 have not
had a clinical breast examination within the past year, and 46% have
not had a mammogram within the past two years.

The report demonstrates the need for outreach and education
programs to target low-income and minority women, in particular,
who have the lowest screening rates for most preventive services.

HALF OF AMERICANS NEVER COMPLETE ANTIBIOTIC
THERAPY; BACTERIAL DRUG RESISTANCE MAY BE A
CONSEQUENCE

There is widespread misuse of commonly prescribed antibiotics.
More than half of American adults who have taken antibiotics do not
take all doses of their antibiotic as prescribed, according to a recent
Gallup survey. Many simply stop when they start to feel better. A
concern of patients is a belief that they will develop a resistance to
antibiotics. Clinicians emphasize that people who fail to take their
antibiotics as prescribed contribute to the development of harder-to-
treat infections.

A national cross section of 1,010 adults and 100 physicians was
surveyed. Although antibiotics effectively treat only bacterial
infections, six out of 10 adults mistakenly believe antibiotics are
effective against viral infections, such as colds and influenza. Eight
out of 10 physicians believe patients save unfinished antibiotic
prescriptions to use again at a later time.

To encourage proper usage of antibiotics, the American Lung Assn.
offers a patient eduction brochure, Winter Wellness: A Common
Sense Guide to Antibiotics.

CARE FOR DYING AMERICANS NEEDS SUBSTANTIAL
IMPROVEMENT, SAY RESEARCHERS

Efforts to prolong people's lives too often merely prolong dying,
according to findings from the largest clinical study ever conducted
in the U.S. with patients near death. An eight-year study, involving
nearly 10,000 seriously ill patients in five leading medical
institutions, the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for
Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) cost $28 million
and was funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.The
study was reported in the November 22/29 issue of The Journal of
the American Medical Association (JAMA).

"Woefully inadequate communication" between medical
professionals and patients near the end of life was the principal
problem found by researchers. Doctors don't clearly convey
patients' chances for survival. And compounding the problem,
patients and families don't discuss their wishes soon, or often,
enough.

A TRAGIC MISMATCH

"There is a tragic mismatch between the health care many seriously
ill and dying people want and what they get," said study director Dr.
William Knaus, critical care specialist and department chair at the
University of Virginia Medical School. "They find themselves in
hospital environments that are geared to doing certain high-tech,
invasive procedures extraordinarily well. Such treatments can
preserve life for conditions that would have previously resulted
more quickly in death. These same techniques, however, can also
prolong dying and make it a painful and mechanical process. The
problem is that the system does not know when or how to stop."

Findings were particularly alarming because the results were
contrary to outside experts' assumptions about what would make it
easier to curtail aggressive medical care, increase the attention given
to pain control and other symptoms, and cut hospital costs.

Study patients were from Beth Israel Hospital in Boston,
MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, Marshfield Clinic/St.
Joseph's Hospital in Marshfield, Wis., and the University of
California at Los Angeles Hospital.

The SUPPORT study involved 4,301 hospitalized patients who, on
average, could be expected to survive no more than six months.
Patients had one of nine life-threatening conditions, including
cancers, congestive heart failure and chronic liver disease. (Deaths
from these nine causes account for more than one-third of adult
U.S. deaths annually.) Among the findings are the following:

+ Doctors didn't know their patients' wishes. For example, if
patients did not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), doctors
didn't know about it 47% of the time.

+ Of the do-not-resuscitate orders, 46% were not written until a day
or two before death, suggesting little advance planning in terminal
illnesses.

+ 38% of patients spent at least 10 days in intensive care, where
aggressive treatment is the norm.

+ Pain was common. Half the patients able to communicate in the
last three days of life said they were in severe pain.

SPECIAL HELP FOR DOCTORS AND PATIENT FAMILIES

The second phase of the study, a subsequent two-year clinical trial,
involved 4,804 seriously ill patients, who were divided into either a
control group that received customary care or an experimental
group, in which doctors and families had the following special help:

+ A nurse whose job was to talk to patients and families about their
concerns and to keep lines of communication open and clear
between them and the hospital and physician staff;

+ Computer-generated reports estimating a patient's probability of
surviving six months and how disabled they would be in the next
two months; and

+ Detailed written instructions on the patient's and family's wishes
regarding treatment--including pain control and "heroic measures"
such as resuscitation--and how much they wanted to discuss their
treatment with their doctor.

These interventions were developed and based on the kinds of
information that doctors said they needed regarding patients' medical
status and wishes for treatment. But according to Knaus, "we were
stunned to find that it didn't make a bit of difference. The tools that
experts thought would work, didn't."

The three-part intervention did not affect the amount of time patients
spent in the intensive care unit, in a coma or on an artificial breathing
machine before dying. Reports of pain increased, and costs of care
did not change.

GUIDELINES TO IMPROVE CARE FOR THE DYING

The study's researchers suggest the following to improve care for
the dying:

+ Establish end-of-life practice guidelines;

+ Teach medical students and physicians that technological
approaches to dying can harm patients;

+ Teach palliative care techniques that enhance life at its end;

+ Hospitals should examine patterns of care for dying patients,
emphasizing the new responsibilities that doctors and hospitals must
assume when death is unavoidable.

WASHINGTON STATE HOSPITALS SHOW TREND TOWARD
SICKER PATIENTS, SHORTER STAYS

The effects of managed care on hospitals are dramatically evident in
Washington state. There are fewer people in the hospital today, and
those who are in the hospital are sicker than ever before. This year,
for the first time in more than 20 years, dollar charges related to their
inpatient care decreased.

In Washington the trend is much more pronounced than in other
parts of the country, according to findings of Bellevue, Wash.-
based HBS International (HBSI). Specializing in measuring health
care outcomes, HBSI found dramatic changes in Washington state
inpatient hospital use in the last year.

Although there was overall population growth in the state and the
degree of illness increased by 4%, between 1993 and 1994 hospital
inpatient days decreased by almost a quarter-million. The charges
associated with hospital inpatient care dropped by over $72 million
and the number of hospitalized patients dropped by 16,670. This
was the only year during the four-year study in which charges
dropped, even though the degree of illness continued to increase.

In Seattle, almost $90 million less was charged for inpatient hospital
care from 1993 to 1994, representing a 5% drop in charges,
114,156 few patient days, and 10,164 fewer hospitalized patients.
Most of the Puget Sound areas followed this trend of treating sicker
patients in less time and for less money.

In marked contrast, Spokane area hospitals charged over $8 million
more during that time period, despite having hospitalized 756 fewer
patients for 21,301 fewer inpatient days than the year before.

COMPUTERIZED PATIENT RECORDS SEEN AS BENEFICIAL
TREND BY MAJORITY OF AMERICANS

The majority of Americans believe the trend toward computerized
medical patient record systems is a beneficial one, and much of their
resistance to participating is reduced with assurances of privacy
safeguards, according to findings of a new Equifax-Harris survey.

Most Americans (98%) also believe that regardless of whether their
files are on paper or in a computer, a patient should be able to obtain
a copy of the medical record maintained about him or her by a doctor
or health facility."

When considering the personal benefits of a computerized patient
record system, survey respondents attached the greatest importance
to the ability to send critical information to an emergency room
doctor while away from home. Some 86% said that would be "very"
important to them. Seven out of 10 also said they could appreciate
the ability to more effectively collate and present medical histories
and test results, and 55% described as "very" important the benefit
of avoiding the need to fill out medical and insurance forms.

When exploring the benefits of quality and reduced cost,
approximately 75% agreed it would be very important to use
computer-based patient records to:

+ Identify substandard doctors and poorly run health facilities;

+ Improve detection of and reduce fraudulent claims by patients,
doctors and hospitals;

+ Reduce the cost of health care by improving the identification of
waste and inefficiency;

+ Get better statistical data for studying the causes of disease and
testing new treatments.

EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN MEDICARE DEMANDS NEW
DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, DIFFERENT MARKETING

There is no question that there will be an explosive growth in the
Medicare market as state and federal reforms mandate more and
more managed care for the senior health care market. The numbers
of enrollees and Health Care Financing Administration contracts for
Medicare managed care plans have grown enormously in the last
few years.

"Medicare managed care will have a growing emphasis on health
and wellness as a key part of demand management," said Sheila
Jacobs, senior consultant for managed care marketing at Scottsdale,
Ariz.-based HSM Group. "It will promote vastly underserved
beneficiaries--a large senior population that's never been served
before by managed care. Productivity is no longer the cash cow."

Adverse Selection Probably Minimal

An initial problem is adverse selection--drawing people who will
drive utilization up. But, remember, people do not tend to leave the
environment they are in. When Cigna of Arizona offered a zero-
premium product, less than 5% adversely selected, said Jacobs.
People don't make a switch because they are not well, but you must
know the demographics of your population.

For example, most people in Arizona--one of the most HMO-
penetrated markets in the country--thought the mecca for Medicare
managed care would be Sun City and the Phoenix metropolitan area,
where there are more than 325,000 individuals who make up the
65+ population of Maricopa County. But, as few as 70,000 net
eligibles are yielded when seniors who have employer retirement
health plans, the working aged and other categories are eliminated.
Jacob explained how insurers found out that some 80,000 of the
senior population were in indemnity plans from their former
employers, which could not be converted to a Medicare risk
product. About 104,000 were already in Medicare HMOs who
would require a switching strategy for marketers. Some 40,000
people were still part of the working aged and had health insurance
through their employers. Some had Medicaid--seniors with end-
stage renal disease or in hospice care.

Demand Analysis Of Marketplace Is A Key

"The key is to do a demand analysis in the marketplace," said
Jacobs. "You better find out the net eligibles, not the gross eligibles.
And remember, patient satisfaction and member retention strategies
are critical. People can change month-to-month to another plan.
Within 45 days they can switch, it's not annual."

Psychographics And Demographics Are Vital

The health plans that will be successful in government risk programs
will need to conduct research to learn the medical needs of the
seniors in the geographic area they serve, as well as their
psychographic and demographic characteristics. Successful
Medicare risk products will require sales and communication
techniques very different from those used to reach the blue-collar
worker, the white-collar professional, baby boomers or any other
market niche, emphasized Jacobs. Then you must never stop
analyzing your product and measuring member service satisfaction
and perceptions. This continuous review of product, providers and
plan members is critical, not only for statistical evidence, but to
document quality.

There are very different ways to market to 60-year-olds vs.
marketing to 70-year-olds or 80-year-olds. However, there are some
general "satisfiers and dissatisfiers" for seniors, said Jacobs. In
order of importance, they are providers, prescriptions and hospitals.
Through focus groups held by The HSM Group, seniors expressed
the following:

+ Providers--Seniors are looking for their own doctors on that list of
providers, and plans with limited physician choices are definitely at
a disadvantage.

+ Prescriptions--Formulary is a very important satisfier, and good
prescription coverage is always a competitive advantage. Availability
of this benefit is important--not having a cap on it, but rather a high-
end coverage. "Seniors like to know that it is open-ended," said
Jacobs. "In fact, they do not use as much medicine as they think
they do, so it's easier to offer a higher benefit because they rarely
get anywhere near the cap."

+ Hospitals--Hospital choice is extremely important. Most people
have a familiarity with the hospital they go to, and they want it on
the list.

+ Friendly environment--Most important to seniors is a friendly and
pleasant environment. More people change plans because of patient
dissatisfaction with medical staff and lack of understanding of HMO
or product. It's crucial to have a strong orientation program for
Medicare patients.

TOP HOSPITALS NAMED, NEW INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS
RELEASED

Performance by this year's top hospitals improved significantly over
last year's benchmark performance and over that of the average
U.S. hospital, according to the annual study, 100 Top Hospitals:
Benchmarks for Success.

Conducted by Baltimore-based HCIA Inc. and New York-based
Mercer Health Care Provider Consulting, the annual study identifies
a set of benchmarks for the hospital industry that represents a
balance of high-quality care, efficient delivery and superior financial
performance.

The new benchmark hospitals reduced expenses per adjusted
discharge by 16%, cut length of stay by 9%, lowered mortality by
20% and increased the return on assets by a huge 58% in
comparison to the average U.S. hospital.

If all U.S. hospitals performed as well as these top 100:

+ Expenses would decline by an aggregate $21 billion annually;

+ Inpatient mortality would drop by 24%;

+ Complications would decrease by 17%.

+ Average lengths of stay would decrease by almost a day.

The new study shows a major shift to the South, with 47% of the
new top hospitals being selected in this region, compared to
previous years where the heaviest concentration of top hospitals was
on the West Coast. One-third of the new top hospitals are investor-
owned, compared with 6% in the study released last year. This
year's study illustrates that investor-owned hospitals are achieving
benchmark levels of performance in quality as well as very high
levels of financial strength.

"This gives substance to the growing belief that investor-owned
hospitals will become very formidable competitors in any market
they enter," according to HCIA's analysis.

CAREDATA REPORTS PROVIDES INFORMATION ON
CONSUMER SATISFACTION WITH MANAGED CARE

CareData Reports Inc. is a New York-based health care market
research firm and provider of information about consumer
satisfaction with managed care. Its primary clients include managed
care organizations focused on developing and demonstrating high
levels of member satisfaction and successfully positioning
themselves in their competitive markets. Clients also include
employers, providers and manufacturers of health care products--
anyone needing to understand how well consumers' needs are being
met in managed care.

Survey Is Widely Used By Health Care Purchasers

CareData's Annual Survey of Health Plan Member Satisfaction is
widely used by purchasers of health care in the U.S. The firm
maintains a large survey panel of employers involved in managed
care--CareData says that its employer panel is the largest in the
country. It is its relationship with these employers that uniquely
provides the market research firm access to consumers involved in
nearly every type of managed care across the country. Employer
participation, through distribution of the surveys to active
employees, allows for accurate identification of plans, plan types
and plan designs.

Its syndicated regional surveys support the development and
implementation of targeted sales and marketing programs. The data
provide managed care organizations the opportunity to continually
position programs toward newly identified consumer needs.
Information covers the performance of health plans, pharmacy
benefits managements plans, disease management programs and
other managed care services. CareData identified how consumers
select a health plan and the aspects of plan performance that drive re-
enrollment decisions.

Managed Care Is Becoming Largest Consumer Product

"Consumers are measuring their plans according to those things that
demonstrate their plans' concern for their health and respect for their
time," said Tod Cooperman, M.D., president of CareData Reports.
"Consumers' decisions to stay or leave their plans, for example, are
often influenced as much by their interactions with plan
representatives on the phone as by their choice of hospitals.

"Managed care is becoming the largest consumer product in the
nation, and the market is beginning to segment along lines of
satisfaction."

The CareData 1995 Annual Health Plan Member Survey  focused on
five areas--southern California, Houston, Connecticut, New Jersey,
and Greater Cleveland. The 10,272 respondents studied were
employees of 81 regional and national companies such as Kraft
Foods and Southern California Edison. The survey evaluated 33
plans, including those offered by Aetna Health Plans, Blue Cross
Blue Shield, CIGNA Healthplans, Health Systems International,
HIP, Kaiser Permanente, Oxford Health Plans, PacifiCare,
PruCare, MetraHealth, New York Life/Sanus and U.S. Healthcare,
as well as several other regional organizations.

It is part of an annual series of studies conducted by CareData that
evaluates consumer experience and satisfaction with primary care
physicians, specialists, pharmacy benefits, disease prevention,
disease management, customer service and plan administration. It
also identifies the issues that contribute most to satisfaction and
drive consumers' decisions to select and stay with plans. The survey
has been conducted in six geographic areas and will soon be
conducted in approximately 30 additional areas. The survey is
repeated at least every 24 months in each surveyed area. Benchmark
information is specific to plan types and regions.

New Survey On Medicare Health Plan Members

This year CareData began a similar annual survey on Medicare
health plan members, distributed to retirees.

MARKETING INTEGRATED DELIVERY SYSTEMS

Industry mavens love the phrase "integrated delivery system."
Consumers choke on it. Integrated care is not just another new
product. It's an entirely new concept, one merger-wary customers
may not like.

The January/February issue of Healthcare Advertising Review
shows how systems across the country--from Sutter Health to
Intracoastal--are introducing themselves. Some explain integrated
care through easy-to-grasp analogies. Others refer to their delivery
system obliquely, emphasizing quality of care in individual facilities.
Demonstrating advantages for the consumer is the goal, and the
challenge, everywhere. The issue also charts changing trends for
children's hospitals and reviews how hospitals are using managed
care companies' open enrollment period to advantage.

In its next issue, Healthcare Advertising Review will present the
"Best of 1995." Any hospital, system or other health care institution
can submit materials for review.

NEW MANAGED GEROPSYCHIATRIC CENTER HELPS
MEDICAL CENTER REPOSITION SERVICES

The January/February issue of Profiles in Healthcare Marketing
features Langhorne, Pa.-based Delaware Valley Medical Center and
its establishment of a managed geropsychiatric unit--the Behavioral
Health Center for Older Adults. From a $1.5 million start-up project
in October 1994, the center has succeeded in repositioning
psychiatric services at Delaware Valley. Just outside of Philadelphia,
the medical center is now seen as the county's premier provider of
geropsychiatric services. Profiles discusses the strategy for
establishing the new center and how the strategy for ongoing
marketing continues to focus on building and maintaining strong
referral relationships.

In addition to seven other profiles of successful marketing
campaigns, this issue of Profiles includes a cumulative index for
1995.

NATIONAL HEALTH LAWYERS ASSOCIATION PUBLISHES
LEGAL MANUAL ON HEALTH LAW

The National Health Lawyers Association has published
Fundamentals of Health Law, a comprehensive legal manual written
by Douglas A. Hastings, Gregory M. Luce and Nancy A. Wynstra.

Information on payer/provider issues in the areas of Medicare and
Medicaid reimbursement and the legal issues that accompany the
delivery and payment mechanisms in a myriad of managed care
arrangements is provided by Hastings, a partner in the Washington,
D.C.-based law firm Epstein Becker & Green.

Organizational principles and regulatory considerations for health
care providers are the focus of Luce, a partner with the Washington,
D.C.-based law firm of Jones Day Reavis & Pogue. His portion of
the manual provides an explanation of the legal constraints in
hospital transactional matters, including antitrust laws, Medicare
anti-fraud and abuse rules and tax issues regarding exemption or
for-profit status.

Selected legal issues in the operation of a hospital that also
correspond to the legal issues faced in other organizational settings,
such as HMOs, home care settings and nursing homes, are the focus
of Wynstra, executive vice president and general counsel of the
Allegheny Health Education & Research Foundation in Pittsburgh.
Wynstra discusses the relationship between the patient and the
hospital; the hospital and the medical staff; the physician, patient,
and hospital; and the hospital and its employees.

A comprehensive quick reference, this single volume provides a
summary and analysis of fundamental legal issues in the health care
field.

Price of the book is $50 for NHLA members or $60 for
nonmembers.

For more information, call NHLA at 202/833-1100.

AHCPR AWARDS 10 RESEARCH GRANTS TO STUDY
CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE MARKETS

The agency for Health Care Policy and Research will award 10
research grants to study changes that are now reshaping America's
health care system as a result of complex market forces. Totaling
$1.4 million for the first year, most of the grants will be completed
in two years.

Currently there is limited information about the types of market
structures and organizations that are emerging in the health care
sector. Less is known about how these structures are influencing the
competitive strategies of health providers and insurers, the quality
and types of care available in the market, or the price and equitable
distribution of services.

Among the key research questions to be addressed by the grantees
are:

+ How has HMO market structure influenced formation of provider
networks?

+ What have been the effects on costs and premiums?

+ How do rural providers perceive and respond to market changes?

+ Do hospital mergers reduce costs?

+ Are savings passed on to consumers as lower prices?

+ Are savings retained by hospitals as higher profits?

"Research will provide purchasers and providers of health care with
an evidence-based understanding of what structural and behavioral
changes are taking place in health care markets, how and why these
changes are occurring, and their implications," said AHCPR
administrator Clifton R. Gaus.

For more information, call AHCPR public affairs at 301/594-1364.

FIFTY HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS IN 21 STATES
WORKING TO RELIEVE PATIENTS' PAIN

The Mayday Fund has awarded a grant to Education Development
Center, a Newton, Mass.-based not-for-profit organization with
expertise in the design of educational programs for health care
professionals, to assist hospitals and nursing homes improve pain
management.

"Our systems of health care have simply not been organized to
identify, assess and treat something as invisible as pain," said
Fenella Rouse, executive director of The Mayday Fund. "Doctors
are trained to fight disease. They receive inadequate training in the
pharmacological and nonpharmacological management of pain."

Numerous commentators, including the World Health Organization
and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, have called
upon physicians, nurses and health care systems to do a better job of
providing pain relief to the patients in their care. It has been well
documented that pain relief is inadequate in many hospitals and
clinical settings, despite the fact that we have the knowledge,
medicines, and other techniques necessary to provide adequate pain
relief for patients with nearly all kinds of pain--those experiencing
temporary but acute postoperative pain, those with chronic painful
conditions and those in pain from advanced cancer or other terminal
illnesses. Recent research has underscored that most of the time,
pain is not only unnecessary, but that unrelieved pain can slow the
healing process, interfere with sleep, increase stress, and may result
in longer periods of hospitalization.

The EDC will assist 50 health care institutions that have already
completed another innovative medical education program entitled
Decisions Near the End of Life.

"As Decisions alumni, these organizations are experienced problem
solvers with a commitment to excellent multidisciplinary care," said
Mildred Z. Solomon, senior scientist at EDC and project leader.
"The new Mayday grant is exciting because it will enable us to link,
via a World Wide Web site, some of the country's finest experts in
pain management at hospitals and nursing homes with a
conscience....We hope to create a virtual community of these
dedicated professionals, so that they can learn from one another as
they experiment with better forms of patient care."

For more information, contact Solomon at EDC by calling 617/969-
7100, ext. 2404.

MEDICAL SCHOOLS RECEIVE GRANTS FOR ADDING
SPIRITUAL TRAINING TO CURRICULUM

Five medical schools will incorporate religious sensitivity into the
practice of medicine by developing courses integrating medicine and
religion. A new grant program--conceived by the Rockville, Md.-
based National Institute for Healthcare Research (NIHR) and funded
by the John Templeton Foundation--has provided $10,000 each to
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Albert Einstein
College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, Ohio State University
College of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University College of
Medicine and East Tennessee State University's James H. Quillen
College of Medicine.

According to recent Gallup Poll surveys, Americans are highly
religious--95% believe in god, 57% pray daily and 42% attend
worship services weekly. Patient spirituality has been found to
influence not only illness prevention, coping, treatment and care, but
how patients define and view their illness as well. While more than
75% of patients recently surveyed believed that their physician
should address spiritual issues as part of their care, these same
patients reported that spiritual and religious concerns were never
included or addressed in their care.

For more information on the faith and medicine program, call NIHR
at 800/580-6447.

LARGE MEDICAL GROUPS MAKE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS
COMPETITIVE

Medical groups have the potential to control provider sponsored
organizations and integrated health care delivery systems. And all
indications are that their involvement will make their integrated
systems extremely competitive with systems where physicians have
less control and ownership.

New utilization data indicate that it is more important to have large
medical groups in integrated systems than to have the systems led by
physician executives, although both large groups and physician
leadership may benefit integrated systems. Thus, for integrated
systems to dominate their markets, they will need to consolidate
primary care physicians into large groups and put them under
capitated contracts as quickly as possible, the new data from the
three leading trade associations for medical groups suggest.

Large medical group practices contracting with and owned by
integrated health care systems are using hospital services much less
than smaller groups and solo practitioners, according to the Medical
Group Practice Digest 1995, which is sponsored by Hoechst Marion
Roussel, Kansas City, Mo. Managing utilization is critical to
controlling costs and premiums charged by HMOs.

The large groups that are members of the Unified Medical Group
Assn., for example, reduced average hospital days per 1,000 HMO
enrollees by 44% to 151 in 1994 from 269 in 1984, according to
UMGA data published in the digest, which is part of Hoechst
Marion Roussel's Managed Care Digest Series. The average hospital
utilization for all HMOs was 297 days for non-Medicare enrollees.
UMGA members reported 872 hospital days per 1,000 Medicare
enrollees, compared with 1,698 for all HMOs.

UMGA members' enrollees' average length of stay in 1994 was
3.05 days for non-Medicare members and 4.44 days for Medicare
members. This compared with 4.2 days for all HMOs for non-
Medicare enrollees and 6.6 days for Medicare enrollees in all
HMOs.

UMGA has 86 medical group members that represent more than
10,000 physicians; most are in California, which is a highly
competitive managed care market. The average UMGA group had
119 physicians in 1994, up 33% from 1993. The medical groups
covered 4.5 million capitated enrollees. Medical group members
covered an average of 51,646 HMO enrollees per group, and IPA
member groups averaged 60,000 enrollees per group, according to
UMGA data published in the digest. The groups reported that an
average of 57% of their revenues came from capitated contracts,
which give them strong incentives to control hospital utilization.

Groups are rushing to integrate with other providers. Sixty percent
of the group practices in the American Group Practice Assn. expect
to be in joint ventures with hospitals by sometime in 1996,
according to a survey conducted by the American Group Practice
Assn. for the digest. This compared with 27% of AGPA members
in such joint ventures in 1994. AGPA represents 250 mostly large
multispecialty groups representing 25,000 physicians. AGPA
members reported a median of 20% of total net medical revenue
from prepaid or capitated managed care contracts, according to the
digest. A survey by the Medical Group Management Assn. showed
that 53% of its more than 6,500 members had some at-risk managed
care revenue and that the groups reported a median of 17.9% of
revenue from capitated contracts.

PROVIDER SPONSORED ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE
CAPITATED, BACKED BY RICH COMPANIES

Provider sponsored organizations and integrated health care systems
seeking Medicare and Medicaid at-risk contracts are likely to have a
lot of capitated revenue and be well-capitalized.

Even in 1994, when Medicare and Medicaid enrollees accounted for
relatively small percentages of their businesses, HMOs capitated
76.4% of their primary care physicians, 45.9% of their specialists,
34.7% of their ancillary providers and 33.8% of their hospitals,
according to the HMO-PPO Digest 1995, which is part of the
Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc.-sponsored Managed Care Digest
Series. Data for the digest were collected by SMG Marketing
Group, Chicago, and the digest was written and produced by The
Business Word Inc., publishers of Health Care Strategic
Management.

PSOs that are backed by integrated health care systems, national
hospital chains, large health maintenance organization chains and
physician practice management companies appear to be in the best
position to seek Medicare and Medicaid risk contracts.

This is because it will require a lot of capital to get into the Medicare
and Medicaid risk contracting business.

Currently, Medicare risk contracting is dominated by four large,
national health maintenance organization companies that have almost
80% of the Medicare at-risk business, according to the Health Care
Financing Administration. They are Kaiser, Humana, FHP and
PacifiCare. HMOs enroll 8% to 9% of the 37 million Medicare
beneficiaries, and that could soar to 30% to 50% during the next five
to 10 years, depending on how Congress changes the Medicare
program over the years. If medical savings accounts are included in
the Medicare Preservation Act of 1995, which is part of the Budget
Reconciliation Act being negotiated by Congress and the president at
press time, HMO growth could be slowed considerably. MSAs
would make fee-for-service providers more attractive to Medicare
enrollees and would allow fee-based providers to retain a bigger
share of those enrollees.

The tables on this page show what integrated systems are likely to
look like, if current HMO contracting patterns are a harbinger of
what is to come. In 1994, according to the HMO-PPO Digest, the
average HMO used 28 acute care hospitals, three psychiatric
hospitals, 2,142 affiliated physicians, 653 primary care physicians
and 1,489 specialists. Most HMOs operate in large metropolitan
statistical areas. Integrated systems may compete by being more
selective in their use of providers.

In 1994, according to the HMO-PPO Digest, hospitals owned equity
in 9% of the industry's HMOs, and 16 HMOs (7%) reported that
they were part of integrated systems. The digest defined integrated
systems as organizations made up of two or more provider
organizations that have formal agreements to integrate or share the
delivery of health-related services. About 32% of the HMOs in
integrated systems were owned by hospitals. Newer and smaller
HMOs were most likely to have hospital ownership in 1994.

But many hospitals involved in developing integrated systems are in
the process of developing HMO-like products for their local
commercial, Medicare and Medicaid markets.

These new integrated systems and small HMOs are challenging
large, established HMOs and HMO chains. In 1994, according to
the digest, HMOs with 250,000 or more members covered 25.7
million members, or 46.7% of all enrollees. Plans with 100,000
enrollees or more accounted for just under three-quarters of all HMO
enrollees. The nation's 25 largest HMO plans enrolled 33% of all
HMO enrollees in 1994.
